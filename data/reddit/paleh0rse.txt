That's where you're wrong -- a blockchain is actually a very specific data structure that requires proof-of-work (or a similarly secure algorithm that doesn't yet exist).
It's only "very wide" when used incorrectly (such as the way it's mistakenly used by the OP).
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:29:55
In terms of blockchain tools and forensic capabilities, we're in a MUCH better position than in any year prior.
The only possibility I can think of is that the thief may leave the coins exactly where they are until the entire Bitcoin protocol/system is eventually modified to obfuscate every transaction and somehow neuter our current analytical methods. Given the focus the devs have on accomplishing that, it's quite possible that we'll be unarmed and blind again in a few years time -- similar to the effects  end-to-end encryption has had on hacking/compromise investigations.
That said, I personally hope the HK law enforcement agencies can nail this one down with good old police work and incident forensics -- which would, of course, make this entire discussion of bitcoin tracking mostly unnecessary.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:34:27
The only thing we have is napkin math based on volume and fees -- which is pretty much useless.
Only Bitfinex itself knows the real revenue numbers.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:48:20
Right on, thank you for the confirmation!
I suggest you try to get the word out that it's a scam in a more formal announcement... and you should probably consider coming up with a new name for your tokens. ;)
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:00:56
I can assure you that a lot of people do actually have the resources to watch and follow the coins, and they will.
My own R&amp;D team will begin tracking them tomorrow as another case study. The company I work for is one of the largest in the world, and we have our own custom suite of recently-developed blockchain analysis tools for exactly this kind of scenario.

OneCoin is a known ponzi scam that has unfortunately gone global with an entirely fake blockchain, not an actual crypto currency.

While settlements can be done on layer 1 in bulk, joining the channels would have to be done individually by each Megaupload user using a layer 1 tx, or via some sort of system that combines tx's (like CoinJoin).
The OP also described the unique case in which, for whatever catastrophic reason, all users wish to cash out simultaneously. In that unique case, every channel would attempt to settle to layer 1 at the same time.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:47:39
Yes, they do.
@_date: 2016-08-10 23:59:07
That question did come up during the conversation and Phil stated that there will be a way to audit the total number of available tokens -- both on and off the exchange -- once they finalize their Omni token solution. They're still working out the technical details for that, but it sounded pretty interesting.
If nothing else, this entire ordeal is certainly being used to demonstrate some pretty cool tech that hasn't really been in the spotlight before.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:57:36
Anything is possible -- there are numerous vectors for attack in any system, and insider threat is certainly among them. A proper investigation would thoroughly explore any/all of the possibilities.

Did you know that it's actually NOT too late to roll back the Bitfinex hack with a reorg?  
It would currently cost less than 2000 BTC to do so -- simply paying all miners from the last 20 hours to reorg the chain -- but, it would also mean that every transaction done on the blockchain since the hack would cease to exist.
True story.
That said, no.

There is honestly no way in hell the current blockchain could handle that kind of volume, so I don't know wtf he is thinking.
I also don't understand the purpose of a microtransaction in this case. Why would every file transfer need to be recorded in a blockchain?  What purpose would that serve? Is it paying the original uploader?
If so, wouldn't it be better to settle them in bulk -- perhaps once every 24 hours -- rather than recording every single file transfer?
Weird... interesting, but weird.

I derped on the OP.  Ya got me there.
That said, please understand that I still don't need any "pro" tips on this subject -- I write such tips for a living. ;)
My original point stands -- it's virtually impossible to successfully launder $70 Million worth of BTC through any alt coin, exchange, or any other method available today.
Future privacy enhancements to the protocol itself *may* change that fact, though. We shall see.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:43:33
The good news is that Omni tokens can be audited just like Bitcoin itself. The bad news is that we still have no details on the legitimate BFX coins. 
I haven't seen any newly created tokens on Omni that match the 72.3 million number (or slightly fewer, given their own alleged contributions to reduce the deficit), so I don't think they've actually done so yet.  I could be wrong, though.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:45:31

7) What office/address information is there for BFXNA, specifically?  
8) Are there any other executive officers that should be identified and located?

What they're doing is functionally equivalent to bankruptcy liquidation, albeit MUCH faster and easier for all parties involved. 
Additionally, there would be no payback plan for the haircut in an actual bankruptcy, so this offering is *potentially* MUCH better, monetarily, for every creditor (user).
Those who are screaming for bankruptcy instead of a haircut and payback plan don't seem to understand what they're calling for -- a bankruptcy would be absolutely f'n terrible.

Don't forget the U.S., Taipei, BVI, and Italy. Bitfinex maintains a corporate presence and interest in all of the above.

Second question: How does each jurisdiction treat Bitcoin, specifically?
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:54:27
Fair enough, and I agree that's the direction he's going in. However, the main chain obviously can't handle Mega volume, so I'm interested to see what he plans to do about that.

I can afford the loss, though, because I follow rule

All 13 of those "users per channel" would need to make an individual layer 1 tx to create or join a channel.  Their coins don't/won't just magically appear within the offline channel system -- they must be locked into the channel system using an initial layer 1 tx.
It's very clear that you don't understand how payment channels actually work, so please study up before commenting further.  You're only embarrassing yourself at this point.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:28:10
They can't cash out those coins, though, so it may as well be a printed number in a frame on their wall for all eternity, and for all the good it will do them.
They also have the added bonus of getting to look over their shoulders for the rest of their lives.
@_date: 2016-08-17 04:32:53
You're reading the wrong price per bitcoin -- in the screenshot, the price is actually 583.xx (found in the upper right corner and ignored by the OP), not the last order price seen on the GDAX tab that you're referring to.
@_date: 2016-08-25 01:45:29


That's the only point at which any of this nonsense gets interesting -- systems akin to Bitcoin sidechains or payment channel solutions.
Everything else is pure snake oil that could be better solved using modern event-driven/distributed databases and classic PKI.
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:17:36
An IVA is often used in lieu of, and to avoid, a bankruptcy -- and IVA's are generally preferable.
Please note that I only had non-loaned fiat on the exchange, and yet I still prefer this haircut versus waiting several years for a potentially much lower payout after all the lawyers and courts steal half.

Since he was referring to literature, I stand corrected.
The novel itself that they may think they're a part of could rightfully be described as  *cyber*punk, but I think they personally fancy themselves as being *cypher*punks within said novel. ;)

You can't join or create a channel as a new user -- adding and locking in your own bitcoin -- without a layer 1 tx. That's how payment channels work.


Ok. Just did.

It's my understanding that you had no funds on Bitfinex, and yet you've spent every day for the last week vomiting all over the Bitfinex threads with intense messages of revenge and destruction.
Combining that fact with my being forced to embarrass you the other night in our little technical "debate," I'm beginning to think you may suffer from some very serious mental issues.
Are you ok, "lad"?  You're not going to strangle a puppy or anything if Bitfinex survives this, are you?
@_date: 2016-08-25 01:23:58
Not really. Like any other wallet software, the tool itself simply constructs and broadcasts the custom transactions using the *actual* keys provided by the user.
The tool also isn't "required" if you can figure out how to manually (programmatically) construct and broadcast the transaction yourself. Not very many people in the world can easily do that, though...
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:04:05
I plan to add it if/when I have time to do more research myself. I do think it will be much easier to track down BitGo's info, though, since they're fully incorporated in the U.S.:  
**BitGo Inc.**  
445 Sherman Avenue, Suite 200A, Palo Alto, CA 94306
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:23:13


Neither of those examples are related to debt recovery and bankruptcy -- two issues that are very much dependent on the jurisdiction of incorporation, even within the U.S. itself.
You couldn't even figure out where they're actually incorporated -- their entire Hong Kong "presence" is now just a mailing address -- so pardon me if I question your Reddit-warrior legal skills, as well.
On another note, they never sold futures. The CFTC got involved earlier this year due to their margin lending structure for U.S. customers.
Did you even trade there?
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:49:44
I have first-hand experience with several of the latest tools that have this capability. Most current tumbling/mixing implementations are flawed -- each in their own way.
The most (only?) effective mixing still involves exchanges that allow for pseudononymous trading accounts -- although, each and every one of those that have the necessary liquidity ALSO keep records that can be seized/subpeona'd.
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:24:34
Even if they hit 1M coins, the highest "bidder" is still supposed to receive a file that nobody else gets. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:19:44

@_date: 2016-08-03 03:59:00
It's actually 2of3, wherein Bitfinex holds 2 of the keys themselves (one "cold", one "hot").
According to Zane, the Bitfinex hot key was somehow compromised, but not their cold one. The nefarious transactions were then automatically signed by BitGo's system using their one key.
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:17:29
What, specifically, makes the Bitfiniex incident a "scam," or otherwise criminal?
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:10:13
I guess the rumors were true then.
Rumor had it that the select U.S. users who had registered with dedicated Synapsepay/Triumph Bank accounts have already been able to withdraw 100% of any USD balances they had in their "Exchange" wallets on Bitfinex, specifically. They simply have to go through Synapsepay and/or Triumph Bank directly to initiate the wire transfers.
I guess this is because those dollars were segregated in those accounts.
Note: This is not the case for USD funds those same users had in their "Trading" or "Deposit" wallets on Bitfinex. I believe those funds are/were mixed in with all of Bitfinex's other users in Bitfinex's own bank account(s).
I just hope this fact was considered when Bitfinex did all their math.
Unfortunately, I wasn't fully verified before this, so I was never offered one of those accounts. :(
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:06:05


You should have just led with that because it's clear you're not seeking fairness. Instead, you're seeking destruction and revenge.
As someone who was affected, and as someone who only had Non-lended fiat at the time of the hack, I still prefer their current offer versus the much worse haircut we'd all receive after *years* of complex bankruptcy litigation.
Seriously, fuck that.

@_date: 2016-08-05 21:29:00
To be fair, that logic doesn't really hold up. The holder of the list could be sending to only a portion of the whole list -- perhaps even in waves.
Even if you determine the emails include recipients who don't use Bitfinex, that STILL doesn't eliminate the possibility that the attacker(s) added your list of email addresses to another list containing bitcoin users (that was obtained elsewhere).
I personally received the phishing email a few hours after this post.

@_date: 2016-08-05 00:45:55
Actually, the users who were registered with Synapsepay/Triumph Bank **DO** have a dedicated/segregated account that holds their personal "Exchange Wallet" USD balance. 
In fact, rumor has it that some of those users have even already withdrawn their Exchange
wallet funds during the last two days via bank wires from Triumph Bank in Texas. (They apparently went straight to Triumph Bank to initiate the wires instead of going through Bitfinex).
Note: Those users could not access the funds in their "Trading" or "Deposit" wallets, though, so I believe those funds may be mixed with the general funds in Bitfinex's own accounts (in Taiwan, perhaps).
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:20:09

I'm fairly certain miners would be quickly and easily convinced to block (blacklist) all the mega tx given the obvious volume such a system would generate.
After looking into Kim's other recent tweets, it appears that he may be planning an off-chain system that simply settles on the blockchain -- which is MUCH better for everyone given Bitcoin's apparent inability to scale the main chain effectively.

That's patently false.


Is bitcoin itself even considered an "asset" in the affected jurisdictions? Have said jurisdictions given Bitcoin any legal standing at all?
Hell, let's start with this question: which jurisdiction(s) even apply to this case? U.S., BVI, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Italy...?


Which exact law? Where? Is said law even applicable to bitcoin?

This is f'n ridiculous. After having talked to Phil at least a hundred times on Teamspeak, I've always felt that he's a kind gentleman.

I'm pretty damn sure I made it clear in that post that it was my personal opinion, and that it was based on the same public statements everyone else was privy to. I was clearly wrong in my *guess*, but I didn't claim to have any insider knowledge of that status.

Right on, thank you!
I'm not sure I agree with that being a safe assumption, though. In a fully mature and closed-loop system and supply chain, that may be the case. 
However, at least initially, many participants will likely need to settle much more frequently in order to convert BTC to fiat and pay external bills -- just as most merchants currently convert to fiat, often instantly, using payment services like Coinbase and BitPay today.

See, that's the thing -- I'm not crying. I (may) have lost a fairly substantial amount of money in this attack, but I personally take full responsibility for assessing and assuming the risks of using the exchange.  I've known the risks for years.

Zane said that they're currently testing the Exchange section of their site, so my guess is that they're testing the new BFXcoin portion, specifically. As a result of those tests, our "USD Equivalent" totals are probably fluctuating to match whatever real/fake trades they're making with BFXcoins in that new section.
Edit:  BFXUSD and BFXBTC have both been added to the ticker at the top of the Bitfinex site.

They've already stated that only one BFX key was used in the attack. BitGo's system then signed the transactions with the one BitGo key. The second BFX key was not compromised.
Which means that BitGo and BFX still have to answer for the normal withdrawal limits somehow being bypassed by the attacker.

Well, actual bitcoins need to be locked to a channel in order to fund said channel; so, yes, doing so obviously requires a layer 1 tx.

Banking is not really considered p2p because there are clearing houses between them, and all members require approval for their inter-bank trades (aka "clearing"). I might actually describe them as pseudo-p2p, though, but only amongst themselves. Their customers (users) obviously can't trade funds in their accounts without centralized oversight and approval by the bank, so most consumer banking is obviously not p2p.
I think you may also be confusing the concept of p2p with decentralization, or closed versus open systems.
Centralized p2p systems are a thing.
I'll say this again: a "peer" in the Bitcoin p2p network is any entity (person, organization, system, bot, etc) that directly sends and/or receives bitcoin.
This obviously includes any merchant or service, like an exchange, that meets that very simple criteria.

Correct.  As a *non-verified* U.S. user, I've been told that my Exchange wallet USD funds are apparently stored in Bitfinex's own  account(s).

@_date: 2016-08-06 20:44:20

However, that doesn't negate the fact that they may do something worth suing for later -- ie. closing up shop instead of honoring the BFXtokens.
@_date: 2016-08-25 01:20:05
Yes, one could certainly do so... if they knew how.
Now, try to guess how many people in the world actually know how to manually (programmatically) construct and broadcast custom multisignature transactions.
The good news is that the coins are neither stolen or lost. The bad news is that this particular user needs to figure out how to craft the transaction without their tool OR wait for Coinbase to fix the damn tool (which is obviously what they should be doing, but they apparently don't give a fuck about their customers).

In all honesty, and regardless of the schoolyard drama going on, I still think that's a very fair question.
I believe that total opposition to any/all new regulations should be *the default starting point* for any group presenting themselves as advocates for Bitcoin.
Only after that notion is loudly or forcefully rejected should they (we) even begin to consider negotiating language and changes to their proposed text.
Entering every new engagement with the assumption that new regulations are inevitable, or unavoidable, is the wrong approach -- a fact that is clearly evident since CA AB1326 was effectively killed just this week.

I do not believe these 7.2 million tokens are legitimate -- their number does not match the actual ~72,000,000 number that would be necessary to match the estimated Bitfinex debt at $1 per token.
Source:  
Instead, I believe someone other than Bitfinex is attempting to set up a scam using these newly created tokens on the same system that Bitfinex itself plans to use to issue their own LEGIT tokens.
The highlighted text in the screenshot is also suspect:  
*"We guarantee the rate of $1 per BFX Omni token. Limited-time Founders discount."*
Bitfinex could/would never say such a thing -- it's straight out of the Paycoin Scam playbook!
Can you please confirm whether or not this is a scam, and then issue a formal warning accordingly?

I'm not sure they'll even offer the BFXcoin on margin.
That said, I believe the initial bids will be at (or close to) $0.01, and initial asks will be between $0.90 and $10.00 (because we traders are clowns).
The spread will then begin to shrink and perhaps settle somewhere between $0.15 and $0.20. After that, the games may really begin, and we'll see some ridiculous moves up and down for quite some time.

A "tiny chain" couldn't survive in Bitcoin without completely changing the tiny chain's POW algorithm (and thus kicking off all current miners on said chain).

They have mentioned "international law enforcement," so both Interpol and the FBI could certainly be involved, as well as various HK, Italy, and BVI authorities.
Remember, their datacenter is somewhere in Italy, while they have corporate interests in the U.S., Hong Kong, Taipei, and the British Virgin Islands.

The $1 figure is nothing more than a placeholder so that users could visualize the potential value of the coins when they logged back on for the first time.
Their *actual* value is currently **zero**, and anything higher than zero can't/won't be realized until they're traded -- which will likely begin with bids at $0.01.

This is NOT "like the banks."  The victims in this case -- the traders -- are humans and bitcoin users, just like yourself, and NOBODY is asking you or anyone else who isn't involved to bail them out of anything.

You're somewhat correct, but what's your point? A LOT of people enjoy gambling, and a lot of traders enjoy the rush of margin trading bitcoin.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that as long as those doing so accept the risk and possible consequences; which, at this point, should be quite obvious to everyone.
Mind your own business, perhaps?

They recently moved their back office functions to Taipei, Taiwan. Their primary bank is also in Taiwan. Their datacenter is in Italy. They have incorporated interests in BVI.
So, please, tell us again how they're "from Hong Kong."

Centralized services are no different than merchants in the sense that they're both peers within the network.
Individual people, merchants, exchanges... all "peers."
In the case of exchanges, they're providing access to their system in exchange for our bitcoin. It just so happens that their system is subsequently used by the customers to trade off-chain IOUs for crypto and fiat.
TL;DR - a "peer" is any entity that participates in the system sending and receiving bitcoin.

No, it wouldn't. Suing to force bankruptcy would also result in a haircut for everyone, albeit one that is MUCH worse than the 36% they're proposing now.


In that case, the courts would actually force prior withdrawals to return all withdrawn money so that it could be included in the subsequent liquidation.
Please study bankruptcy proceedings. They're terrible. NOBODY should want that...

yes, for real-time trades, you absolutely DO need to let the third party hold the keys so that they can move the coins AND FIAT around quickly enough to handle their order books.
There is no elegant solution to replace that process for real-time trading of fiat/crypto at this point, and even crypto-only exchanges need to move coins too quickly to allow for trades involving user keys.

It's akin to an individual voluntary agreement (IVA), so it's likely to be perfectly acceptable in most jurisdictions.

Multi-sig generally refers to the use of multiple keys held by multiple parties to ultimately control transactions from a single wallet -- NOT the combination of multiple inputs, from multiple wallets, controlled by keys held by multiple parties, into a single tx.

@_date: 2016-08-03 14:39:15
You do realize that trading is a thing, right?  The reason bitcoin has a well-established price history is a result of the trading done on exchanges.  So, without "trusting 3rd parties with our private keys,"  how you do you propose we trade in real time with large quantities of cash and bitcoin?  
Are you suggesting that all such trading should stop until such a time that decentralized exchanges can handle the volume necessary for said trading?

That is absolutely true.
However, it's also completely different than what you've previously described as "private blockchains."
Instead, it's just a normal distributed database that anchors to the actual Bitcoin blockchain at regular or event-driven intervals -- which is nothing more profound than a new backup/auditing mechanism.

In bankruptcy, they only have to resolve it within the limits of their available corporate-owned assets, and not a dime more.

Yes, it's a multisignature wallet wherein the user holds X of Y keys. Their tool is supposed to allow you to withdraw from the vault without using Coinbase's key.

That's not what sentiment analysis is.
I've worked on genuine sentiment analysis solutions designed to identify insider threats based on the *sentiment* of employee messages and emails. 
It's also used by many very large companies to analyze open source and social media content for marketing, political, and other purposes.
Companies like HP and IBM have been building genuine sentiment analysis solutions for several years now. It's a very interesting concept involving NLP, lots of unstructured data, and even some AI thrown in for good measure.
What you described is simply blockchain analysis using various analytical tools. Examples include the tools and services offered by startups like Chainalysis, Coinalytics, Elliptic, Blockseer, CoinLab, etc...

Psychological? Oh Jesus Christ... Willy's timed purchases were miniscule compared to the high volume trades occurring between each one, and his individual purchases *never* went more than a few pennies North of the spread. In fact, Willy was entirely designed NOT to move that spread, as he consistently waited for the spread to become more narrow before firing every purchase.
There are similar accumulation/sell bots operating today that involve just as much (or more) volume.


The Chinese markets drove the market directions in November and December 2013, regardless of Western enthusiasm and media coverage -- both of which had minimal impact during that time for the simple fact that hardly any Westerners could even get involved in the trading quickly/easily to capitalize on all of the attention.
While Gox certainly had some whales at the time, their cumulative volume and subsequent market moving capabilities paled in comparison to continuous volume in China -- even if most of that was "faked."
No respectable bitcoin trader from that era should/would agree with you that Gox (or Willy) made the market at that time.
That's simply incorrect.

Some valid questions here regarding the BFXcoin.
How do we determine the integrity of the token system? (ie. The fact that total available tokens = X) How does one audit an Omni commodity?
For instance, how do we know that they didn't give themselves a million BFX tokens that they can "sell" on the token market(s) to drive the price of the tokens down, while simultaneously collecting the real fiat (or crypto) for those sales?

In the conundrum, there are no LN nodes other than the two parties involved in creating the new channel.
Meaning, if no path (route) exists between you and I, the LN devs have stated that we can simply create a new direct channel between the two of us. They've designed it (in true p2p fashion) such that every individual user can be a node and solutions like this one are possible.
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:29:14

I agree that trustlessness is THE key to the entire success of this system. It's actually Satoshi's primary innovation, as well.

It's the other way around. It is those who wish to keep the blocks small who are "changing basic Bitcoin premises."
Bitcoin is/was meant to be a peer-to-peer electronic **cash** system for *everyone*, not a decentralized **settlement** system reserved for the ultra-wealthy and large corporations -- those being the only entities that can afford exorbitant tx fees.
@_date: 2015-12-28 05:15:20
That's an awful lot of trust in a very centralized group of individuals and their theoretical improvements that don't even exist yet.

@_date: 2015-12-30 02:20:13
There are actually some other small changes required in the code to support the larger blocks; but, the patch for all of it does already exist.
@_date: 2015-12-05 18:06:08
None of that matters as long as the growth of the **entire pool** keeps pace with, or is ahead of, the increases in mining difficulty.
Remember, in a mining pool, the hashing power of each individual device/participant is almost irrelevant. ROI for the entire pool itself will increase as a result of increasing participation in said pool. (Example: billions of mobile device 21inc SOCs going online).
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:25:12


First, Bitcoin is/was so "easy to use" that the vast majority of businesses that accept it still do so through centralized payment services like Coinbase, BitPay, etc.
Second, Lightning Network will likely be *much* more complicated for medium to large businesses to operate based just on the financial planning aspects alone -- capital requirements and projections for channel funding, delayed settlements, etc.
There is also the additional bitcoin -&gt; fiat conversion process that obviously requires third party brokerage services just as it does today.
The next time you walk into a large store, please feel free to ask the owner/manager if he or she has the skills, resources, or patience to handle all of the above in-house.
My guess is that they'll laugh hysterically before walking away.

Even with SegWit, 1MB blocks may soon turn the entire user experience into a steaming pile of expensive bitshit.

Awesomeness all around, eh?
@_date: 2015-12-05 22:01:17
As long as the pool's block rewards keep pace with the increases in pool membership, the hashpower of the network is also irrelevant. 
They'll obviously need to plan their resources accordingly for times when that isn't the case.

@_date: 2015-12-30 23:20:45
That's a real shame because it's simply not true at all, and knows that. 
Edit: looking at the date, it might just be that he made that statement before the actual math for SW was well understood. We have since learned that we will NOT see a 4X increase with SW alone using its current design.
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:12:33
Which question are you referring to?
@_date: 2015-12-24 02:08:29
You're still avoiding the second half of the question -- that being that businesses everywhere tend to lean toward outsourcing all electronic payment processing.
In this case, doing so would lead to unavoidable centralization -- which flies directly the face of the LN developer claims that centralization of LN is unlikely "because you can just route around centralized hubs."
You can't route around hubs -- find or create other private/direct channels -- if businesses use such services (hubs) for LN payment processing.
See my point?
@_date: 2015-12-23 04:43:57


No it won't.
At best, it will be roughly equivalent to an increase to 2-3MB, and at the added cost of kludgy code, complexity, security, and an artificial sense of relief while they continue to simply delay the inevitable.
Hell, they're not even willing to implement the SW correctly -- which would actually require a hard fork, rather than the kludgy soft fork they've apparently settled for.

The current problem is that Core won't even acknowledge that option. They've apparently closed their suggestion box until 2017.
I personally love that option, though, so I've been pushing it for weeks! 
One hard fork with proper SW and a modest increase to 2MB blocks. We then tackle the rest with soft forks for a while, wait for LN to finish cooking, and help get the entire app ecosystem up to speed with SW patches.

@_date: 2015-12-28 05:20:53

In the case of LN, that will result in large centralized payment hubs that we can't simply route around.
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:53:54
If what you're saying is true, and centralized payment hubs are more beneficial than not, then why are the LN devs claiming that they're doing everything in their power to prevent centralized payment hubs?

@_date: 2015-12-24 04:26:24
In other words, we won't actually be able to route *around* large payment hubs.
That has been my entire point, and it's contrary to everything the LN devs have been claiming lately in their efforts to dispel criticisms of the design.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:30:17
Why would merchants care about fees? Especially if the tx makes it into a block?
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:29:50
You need to obtain the detailed transaction information from the SENDER, not the wallet on blockchain.info.
Ask the sender for the:  
- **destination address**, and   
- **Transaction ID** (this is not your order OF. This is the ID for the actual bitcoin transaction).  
You can then use those to find the actual transaction using any block explorer website.  
My guess is that they sent them to a different address, and the fault may be yours if you entered it incorrectly or your session was hijacked with a MITM attack that changed the address without you noticing. 
Alternatively, their withdrawal system could have screwed it up.

Whatever happened to the idea of node operators needing to deposit a certain amount of liquidity into the channels in order to match all of the funds being transferred on said channels?
Has the design changed, or did I misunderstand that requirement from the beginning?
What have you recently changed to discourage the centralization of channels? Will large merchants no longer need "channel providers" to operate dedicated nodes for them? (ie. Best Buy using some CoinbaseLN(tm) service for the last channel leg of every path customers use to pay them)

Not so much. The reason so many miners used 750kb as a soft cap is because it was the default setting in Bitcoin Core for a very long time, and miners simply didn't change it -- which pretty much nullifies most of the rest of your pet *theory*.

Most of the pseudo fee market we've experienced to date has not been based on full blocks, so there wouldn't be much shock (If any) if blocksize were to double tomorrow.

There is something called a *breaking point.*  It's obviously somewhere higher than $0.30 per tx.

I specifically said that they'd need to outpace the external growth in order to solve more blocks.
However, if their plan to eventually implement the new SOCs across the entire electronics spectrum proves successful, they'll easily outpace the growth of other pools when millions/billions of 21inc chips go online.

How do you reconcile all of that with the fact that even the Core **and** LN devs have almost unanimously agreed that blocksize needs to be increased "at some point" in the next year or two? Why delay the inevitable and cause yet another economic shock to the system at a later date? What's the purpose of the delay when the very simply code for a bump to 2 or 4MB already exists?
Why not do a **proper** SW implementation in the same hard fork as a meager increase to 2MB (that has near universal consensus)?

The wallets and miners can't automatically do anything if/when transaction bidding wars start. Miners will always side with the highest bidders unless there's some other incentive not to do so.
I also wouldn't trust miners to work in the users' best interests when it comes to "telling wallets to raise fees."  
I don't think everyone is grasping just how messy the fee markets and user experiences will be if/when blocks are continuously full....

First, the high multiplier you keep referring to is only the *theoretical maximum for multisig transactions under perfect conditions,* so 4MB is only possible under very rare circumstances (perfectly balanced blocks, in terms of normal+multisig tx).
Second, the reason it's *kludgy* is because the code to implement SW as a soft fork is *kludgier* than it would be if they did it (correctly) using a hard fork.
Even Gavin has expressed deep concerns over how they're planning to jerry-rig SW with a messy soft fork, rather than doing it right the first time.
Edit: I believe one reason they won't use a hard fork to implement SW properly is because they're afraid they'd have to answer the following tough question: *If you're doing a hard fork to implement segwit anyways, why not slightly raise the block size at the same time?*
They'd be very hard-pressed to provide any reasonable answer to that since they've already admitted that it still needs to be raised with a hard fork in the future.
So, instead, we get kludgy.

Block size is not "2MB with SW."
Max block size remains 1MB. The only difference is that signatures are sent separately, so we can therefore fit approximately 1.75x to 2x the number of transactions in the same old 1MB blocks.
You're the one who doesn't "get it." 
Realistically speaking, the SW will provide the same number of tx as a simple 2MB max block size would without SW -- *not* 3.5 to 4.

Cars that drive to the charging station to charge themselves, and then find and pay for a parking spot while they wait for you? They could also diagnose faults and order their own replacement parts.

I've used regular ATMs all over the planet, and they all use flat rates for fees.

At 7%, that same withdrawal would cost $35 USD on this BTM, which is (and should be) completely unacceptable.
Even a flat rate at the exorbitant strip club rates would be better than what we're seeing with all the BTMs.
Seriously, these rates are just absurd...

The naysayers believe in a mystical fee market wherein everyone "gets to" retry their transactions over and over again until they eventually outbid everyone else and finally get their transaction included in a block.
Nevermind the fact that most wallets don't yet have this ability, or the fact that delayed transactions will likely be completely unacceptable to most services, merchants, and consumers.
These points seem to be completely lost on those who oppose increasing the block size at this time.
Could it be that many of them don't care if Bitcoin itself ever properly scales, since a) they've already made millions, and/or b) they hope to eventually alleviate the issue with paid third party services of their own?  Hmm... maybe.

Correct. However, that flies directly in the face of the recent claims made by LN's developers that "centralized LN hubs are unlikely, and you can just route around them if they are there."


See above.  


I thought that LN channels require matching liquidity. How can large retailers afford to match the amounts placed into channels (for future use) by their customers?
If every customer deposits $200 into their Starbucks LN channel for future use, how can Starbucks itself possibly hope to match that amount on their end with the necessary (locked) funds?

Wait until it's finished downloading the entire blockchain for the first time -- it's roughly 60GB. Your transaction and coins should show up after it's finished.
Depending on bandwidth, it could take quite a long time to finish synchronizing the first time you do so. After that, you're golden.
Just make sure you encrypt your wallet and that system never gets compromised with a key logger...

Lots of opinions, but not very many counter-proposals with specifics and code.

Some might (rightly) argue that the Core team changing Bitcoin into a settlement system reserved for wealthy people and companies to do expensive transactions, rather than the p2p electronic cash system that Satoshi created for everyone, is the real "compromise of Bitcoin's core principles."
@_date: 2015-06-25 04:13:32
Exactly. The dramatic drop in full nodes since the Spring of 2013 is very much the result of home mining becoming unprofitable while the community simultaneously unleashed a ton of new SPV options.

I don't need a large channel on my end of the paths, but Wal-Mart and Best Buy certainly do -- which would naturally lead to new companies providing "LN payment processing services" to all merchants.
I can envision a new era of VisaLN, MastercardLN, CoinbaseLN... **or Blockstream** -- each competing with one another to provide merchants with the final channel leg in every customer's path.
Is this an inaccurate or inappropriate assumption?

Neither your laptop or RasPi come with an embedded low-power ASIC specifically designed to mine the minimal amount of bitcoin necessary to facilitate the system's software application layer.

Mycelium still offers most of the p2p benefits, so I disagree.

The fee market is going to be a complete mess for quite some time after we begin filling up blocks. The entire user experience is going to be a guessing-game nightmare plagued by delays and failed/stuck transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-18 08:31:48
Absolutely. Why? Because, at the point in the distant future when a fee market is necessary (One the mining subsidy becomes too small), the entire network and ecosystem will be much more stable and mature. 
More instantly, we won't be in the middle of trying to convince the world that Bitcoin works well; because, at that point, using it will already be commonplace.
Why are you so interested (or invested?) in seeing a fee market develop while the user base is still so small, and while the block reward is still 25 (or even 12.5) BTC?

They are only correct under current conditions -- limited adoption, limited capacity, limited promise of future capacity.
It's my belief that more network capacity would lead to dramatically increased user adoption, that said user adoption would lead to more business adoption, and that all of those businesses would therefore have a real incentive to run their own full nodes for security, auditing, and efficiencies -- even if doing so costs them a good deal of money.
Good accountants will also figure out ways to turn running those nodes into tax deductions.

No, I'm saying that miners didn't leave it set at the default 750kb for that reason. In reality, many miners were simply too lazy to change Core's default setting.

@_date: 2015-12-28 06:19:35
I agree. However, by leaving the blocksize as is, the Core devs appear to want the fee market to develop now, rather than later. The main chain's fees will likely rise pretty quickly once the blocks are consistently full.
At what point do main chain fees make new direct routes between users in LN cost prohibitive, and what affect will that have on users of each network when that occurs?

Insurance itself must use a shared pool in order to work -- all contributions are shared by every participating member.

I think you'll find a lot of that around here, and most instances can be explained by the simple fact that many of the best developers think the rest of us are idiots -- or, that we simply could never understand the technical nuances of any truly detailed answer.
So, rather than provide us with the technical details and direct answers we crave, they instead attempt to satiate our curiosities and concerns with "high level" responses that are more marketing fluff than substance.
Then again, some of them are also just completely full of shit.
The trick, of course, is in figuring out which of these scenarios is true in each case; and, sadly, that usually requires many hours of research digging into everything on our own.

The centralized entities (corporations) I referred to will be the ones funding all of the most critical channels. They will also be the ones who are signing up all of the merchants to create the final paths (channels) to said merchants. 
What happens when said channels to your preferred vendors implement KYC/AML requirements (imposed by the State)? What happens if/when they start demanding that LN wallet developers implement new KYC/AML variables so that those wallets are "authorized" to use those specific corporate channels?
Bottom line:  LN channels will likely NOT be censorship resistant, and that's an awful lot of security and freedom to give up for "scalability."
LN is **not** Bitcoin, no matter how many times the Blockstream devs have tried to paint it as such.

Average consumers don't want or need to convert currencies when they're not traveling, so it's going to be REALLY difficult to ever justify a ridiculously high conversion fee just to withdraw cash locally.

It's simple: Are you holding/controlling the private keys for your users?  
If so, prepare to be licensed and regulated as both a money transmitter and whatever new labels each individual U.S. State applies to your business (ie. BitLicense).

First, you're acting as though that Chinese scenario can't happen regardless of the number of full nodes outside of China (since we all know, and you already acknowledged, that they have greater than 50% of the mining power).
Second, I disagree with you, Peter, Greg, etc, that an increase in block size, along with the potential very large increase in adoption, will lead to *fewer* full nodes. 
In fact, I believe the opposite to be true based on the ever-increasing number of large businesses that will require full nodes (each for several various reasons).
Why don't you go ask your fellow naysayers how much they estimate it will cost to run a Lightning Network node, and then tell me again how important they really think it is to keep things light and affordable.
While you're at it, ask them how large they'll need the Bitcoin blocks to be in order to operate LN on a global scale.
Your "centralization nightmare" scenario based purely on a slight increase in block size is absolute bullshit.
You can also chill with the lectures on how and why Bitcoin works versus other solutions -- including other distributed solutions. I'm intimately familiar with all of the above.
@_date: 2015-06-12 06:30:46
Do you honestly believe we'll see a dramatic drop in full nodes if/when block size goes to 20MB? How about just 8MB?
And you honestly give no credence at all to the theory that mass adoption by consumers and businesses alike would itself lead to a dramatic **increase** in full nodes? (based on the fact that a large number of those businesses would have a fiscal/security incentive to run one of their own).
I also haven't seen any of you do an in-depth analysis or technical write-up of an actual **consumer-friendly** fee market -- however you envision it working from day one.
I personally believe that a competitive fee market would be extremely messy at this early stage, and said mess will likely scare off many potential users who might otherwise use Bitcoin if it worked at least as well as it does today. The entire network is way too immature to throw a competitive fee market into the mix.
That's my two satoshis...

What if the blocks fill up long before Blockstream's (and other) options are viable?  Do you not see the danger in that (in terms of tx friction and adoption)?


Both Sidechains and Lightning Network are likely **years** from being ready for deployment.
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:50:55
I agree that we must maintain a balance, in terms of "measurable" decentralization. However, 2-8MB blocks would still be perfectly fine in the immediate future.

I believe that cashing it out is/was the major loss for retail firearms merchants, not just accepting it.
@_date: 2015-06-07 06:31:55
I understand that. You understand that.
However, the average first world consumer who just wants some cash to spend on any given night will not understand (or accept) that at all.
Regular ATM fees are already borderline insane. Telling people to "be your own bank," and then charging them 7-10% just to grab some cash for he night is going to be a *really* hard sell -- even for the most "reasonable" consumers.
I'm convinced that the exorbitant BTM fees are certainly not helping with adoption in any way, shape, or form. In fact, I think they're hurting adoption.
Hell, I'm a pretty "hardcore bitcoiner" myself, and even I have only used the local BTM once -- and that was just for the novelty of the experience.

First, I don't agree that SW will provide enough room for a long enough period of time. 
Second, the economic shock I was referring to is the shock to the new fee market if you start such a market now (prematurely), and then double or quadruple the blocksize later. Beginning such a market without those variables known ahead of time will result in economic shock events if/when the increases are eventually decided and implemented.
If the stated goal is to create a new fee market based almost entirely on block space scarcity, then it's very irresponsible to do so before the ultimate decision on blocksize has been made. They are knowingly building economic shock events into that new market, which is something I'm opposed to.
Instead, they should do whatever they need to do to delay the formation of a fee market until a longer term solution is found for blocksize. If that means a 2-4MB hard fork this year to act as a stop-gap, then that's exactly what should be done to prevent future fee market disruptions/destructions.

The only thing they (governments) can actually do is make it a crime for legal merchants / businesses to use or accept it -- which would probably be a complete show-stopper for "mass" adoption in any first world nation that does so.
That said, Bitcoin would certainly still continue to function in other jurisdictions and in the shadows where it's banned, but we really don't know what effect(s) such a ban would have would have on price and development.

@_date: 2015-06-02 06:44:08
That's correct. We'll still see blocks under 2MB for quite some time, and they'll scale up toward the new 20MB slowly over time unless adoption goes parabolic -- which would be a complete disaster (or even impossible) if the limit was still 1MB.
The increased orphan rate would only be a concern if the blocks jump straight to the new max 20MB overnight -- which actually makes Peter's claim somewhat dishonest or at least misleading.

This type of hyperbole is getting annoying, but I'll try to ignore it... for now.
Bitcoin is certainly not the only secure blockchain, but it's easily the *most* secure (see also: decentralization).
You also don't seem to understand what I meant by "quietly" and "at will."  Do you understand the vast differences between centralized and decentralized roll backs, in terms of their processes and inherent security?


As an information security professional for over twenty years, your shiny new private ~~blockchains~~ databases will be nothing more than yet another attack surface (and headache) in the enterprise. (See also: SQLi attacks and "teh cloud"). Unlike decentralized blockchains, **manually** securing your shiny new databases will be a full time job for real people. So, uhh, more job security for me? Cool, I guess...


I actually agree that 1MB blocks cannot effectively handle future (potential) growth, but I also believe we'll see that change soon enough through a myriad of core patches and third party developments -- to include raising the value for MAXBLOCKSIZE, specifically.
On another note, you do realize that the NASDAQ system is still in testing, right? And, that the number of transactions involved in their private equity market is only a handful of trades per day? So, umm, yeah. You should probably find a better example...
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:23:20

The velocity is defined by the movement of the currency -- which is obviously improved by a higher number of transactions (aka coins moving).

You remind me a lot of that idiot Luke-jr.
Oh, and like I said before, my home fiber connection and personal full nodes could handle 50mb blocks if I needed them too, so even your Bitcoin-Core-at-Home-for-everyone fantasy is doable by any first world user with a decent connection and "dedication to the cause."
I'm so damn tired of you naysayers and your bullshit fantasies about 500k blocks and dial-up connections. You're all so full of yourselves, and full of shit.
In the future, most nodes will be run by large stakeholders (companies) that see the benefits of maintaining their own nodes for auditing and security purposes -- and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that outcome.

Several of the Core devs appear to have no issue with the main blockchain being reserved for large transactions with high fees.
They've repeatedly stated that the main blockchain should not be used to record "every cup of coffee." To ensure that doesn't happen, they are imposing block space scarcity while simultaneously encouraging the speedy development of a fee market.
I don't think it's much of a stretch to imagine main chain transactions costing dollars instead of cents in the not so distant future.
@_date: 2015-12-18 01:01:15
I don't think you actually understand how or why Bitcoin works.
The bitcoin transactions -- the tokens of value themselves, the bitcoins -- are the keys to the *entire* incentive and security structures. They're the fuel for the whole engine and the reason the blockchain remains secure.
I have yet to see ANY private blockchain implementation that solves (or effectively replaces) the incentive/security dilemma.

My entire point is that the devs have claimed centralized payment hubs like ABC are unlikely, while I have attempted to demonstrate that they are actually very likely given most merchants' preference for outsourced payment processing.
IOW, you're arguing about the affect such entities may have on me out the network, while my only point has been that they'll exist -- and possibly be very prevalent -- which is contrary to the LN devs' recent claims.

Bitcoin itself is still open and standardized. I couldn't care less what is built on top of it, or by whom, as long as they don't bloat or spam the chain too much.

I don't agree with everything Chris has to say on the subject, but we do share some of the same concerns.
Dramatically higher fees on the main blockchain happen to be a HUGE concern for me -- and not only because of what they may or may not mean for LN's viability.

I'm worried about centralization in spite of the LN devs' recent claims that large payment hubs are unlikely; so, I have attempted to demonstrate that, actually, the opposite is true.
It's my hypothesis that centralization in LN is **highly likely** because nearly every merchant in the developed world outsources their payment processing, and that we can't simply route around such hubs when those become the only way of using LN with said merchants.

Well shit...
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:26:46
Yes, but those savings come at the HUGE cost of exposing any/all businesses that accept zero-conf transactions to MUCH EASIER  fraudulent double-spends (redirects).
FSS is honestly the only acceptable form of RBF -- unless your entire goal is to push merchants and consumers off of the main chain?
Remember the 2-8% that merchants currently save when using Bitcoin instead of credit cards? Yeah, well, that all goes away if payment processors like Bitpay need to worry about (and pay for) constant fraudulent transactions. The costs for doing so will be passed directly back to the merchants, and we'll all be right back to where we are today with credit card processing fees.
Care to explain any holes in the above reasoning?

That would make it useless for everyone, not just Bitcoiners. The entire point of such a thing would be to replace cash for consumers. If they can't use that anywhere and everywhere, consumers wouldn't use it, and the entire project would die on the vine.
The Feds know that. If it ever happens, the Fedcoins would likely be fairly frictionless. After all, if you can't send a few to a friend using your phone whenever you want to, what would be the point?
So, setting up a decentralized digital exchange using them would be fairly easy if they're easy to spend.

That's primarily because he didn't foresee the crazy fast pace at which ASICs evolved. I honestly don't think he ever imagined difficulty would get as high as it has so quickly.
We basically eliminated home mining in just 4 years, instead of the expected 8 or 10. 
He may have also believed that any mass adoption would occur *before* the crazy jump in difficulty, or simultaneously, not afterwards.

@_date: 2015-06-11 21:01:42
Of course it eventually needs to happen once the mining subsidy is much lower; however, I don't think that it needs to happen *this year.*
I'd much rather see the inevitable fee market develop once the Bitcoin ecosystem is much more mature -- perhaps sometime after the next halving (or the one after that), and also after other off-chain options (Lightning Network, fully functional sidechains, etc.) are more mature.
I'd REALLY hate to see a completely messy and premature fee market limit adoption -- and that's *exactly* what will happen if figuring out proper fees becomes annoying, expensive, or otherwise results in consistent failed/delayed transactions.

Many might argue that the payment processors have just as much influence, if not more, than the miners. After all, the miners will follow the money. If the largest payment processors will only use a certain version, then miners are going to want to provide them with that supply.
@_date: 2015-12-28 04:43:21
Many, including myself, disagree with the current **theories** that larger blocks are guaranteed to lead to disastrous (or even dangerous) centralization.
In fact, I believe the exact opposite would occur if adoption goes parabolic.
I also believe efforts should be focused on incentivising full Bitcoin nodes -- not LN nodes -- and parabolic adoption itself would provide one hell of an incentive for many more businesses to run their own full nodes for auditing and security purposes.
@_date: 2015-12-28 04:55:25


That's my point. Perhaps, instead if blindly pushing small blocks and LN as definitive solutions, you should begin questioning *all* of the theories -- not just mine.

First, at best, the SW soft fork *may eventually* lead to a 1.75x increase -- and that's only if all wallets and software are updated and literally everyone uses only SW transactions.
Second, SW itself would be better implemented in a hard fork.
Third, said hard fork should also include a small bump in the max blocksize to 2 or 3MB -- something that also already has near universal consensus.
Please do these things right the first time; or, worst case, get the hell out of the way.

Here's another way:  wait for governments to create and issue 1:1 Fedcoins, and then use those instead of the current messy fiat system to create actual decentralized exchanges for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. ;)
Unlike many here, I believe the advent of a Fedcoin *could* be a good thing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-18 04:37:03
Because a standard federated database would be a better choice, and POW mining itself is entirely pointless in the absence of trustlessness, or in the presence of centralized access controls.
Without its trustlessness, the Bitcoin blockchain itself would be utterly pointless given its inherent inefficiencies, and it would no longer remain secured against centralized corruption.

In this case, Layer 1 is not easily replaceable -- just ask any altcoin developer to date.
@_date: 2015-06-04 18:47:27
Perhaps. 
Then again, are you telling me that such wallets couldn't be incorporated in a decentralized exchange anyway?
The current road block to a truly decentralized USD/BTC exchange is the fiat side of the equation. If they ever create a Fedcoin that is 1:1 with the USD and easily sent P2P, then the fiat side of the decentralized exchange equation becomes easy as hell -- even if it requires certified user wallets, middleware could facilitate both sides of the exchange between two people.

My entire point is that the LN devs have recently claimed that such centralization is highly unlikely or otherwise easy to avoid by routing around.
Why? How? If most businesses sign up for centralized payment hubs, how can we possibly route around them?

@_date: 2015-12-24 03:37:39


Please keep re-reading that sentence until you realize just how badly it completely contradicts itself.
A hub, by definition, is a **centralized** point in any network.
The LN devs have recently claimed that centralized payment hubs are unlikely, while I have attempted to demonstrate that the complete opposite may be true given most merchants' preference for outsourced payment processing services.
*Connectivity* isn't the issue. I couldn't care less about the increased connectivity if it comes at the cost of increased centralization.

To be fair, the only reason that's true is because several core devs have stated that they'd immediately reject Gavin's blocksize patch if he submitted it as a pull for Core instead of releasing it as XT.

That is patently false. Period.
I'd probably have to teach you a dozen different concepts in information security to explain why that's the case, but I'll just go with this instead: single (centralized) points of failure are bad, mmkay?

Ironically, at that point, it will no longer be useful for buying coffee given the increased tx fees and delays.
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:09:30
Of course fees can work, but it's impossible for the miners to "collaborate with wallets" to prevent users from starting a fee bidding war that degrades the user experience for everyone who doesn't bid higher than the "generally acceptable level of fees" you mentioned.
With full blocks and continuous delays, determining what fee you should use for every given transaction would be a complete and total mess -- a bidding war and guessing game.

I've read every single version of the regs, Bruce. I also happen to agree with you that technical solutions would be better than government regulations, but that core belief doesn't match reality.
In reality, it's our job to push back against these rules as often and as boldly as we can until they become much more specific and less burdensome for everyone.
Lawsky made the claim that the NYDFS is willing to evolve the regs as needed. Let's call his bluff on that one and keep trying to do exactly that over the next few years.

I know exactly what RBF is, and I'm not a fan (with or without safe mode).
Do you really expect consumers to tolerate having to constantly rebroadcast their transactions? Sometimes waiting tens of minutes or hours before even finding out that they have to do so? Truly?
Child pays for parent is even worse in that it places the fee burden on the recipient of a transaction.
I do like the payment protocol, though.


...in a very non-competitive fee market wherein the minimum fee is still good enough 99.x% of the time. 
I personally don't think the current floating fees mechanism considers enough variables to handle a much more competitive fee market **in real time and to the satisfaction of consumers.** (who, by the way, will likely never massively adopt non-SPV wallets/apps since most consumer transactions will likely be done on mobile devices).
Constantly receiving notifications on your Android phone like *"The fee for your pizza purchase two hours ago needs to be increased again"* won't be fun for anyone involved -- consumers and merchants alike.


I believe that the advent of many new SPV clients and the fact mining became non-profitable for people previously running core at home likely had more of an impact than what you're suggesting. 
Just out of curiosity, which node count method are you using to support that statement?


I'm not sure you can compare the  business practices of the few early adopting companies we have today to those we'll likely see after an actual mass adoption event.  You could be correct that many will outsource their nodes, but perhaps still others will prefer to have a very fast connection to their own privately hosted node for improved security and auditing capabilities.
As I said before, it's a theory. However, unlike you, I don't believe we have any applicable precedent or data that can tell us what it will look like after true mass adoption.


I agree with all of that, and it happens to be the exact reason I don't want to see consistently full blocks **this year.** 
The entire ecosystem is simply not ready for consistently full blocks at this time, and it won't magically be much more ready for them in the next 12 months either.
In terms of user experience, throwing a highly competitive fee market into the mix at this stage will likely be an absolute nightmare, and it could possibly go pretty far in destroying confidence in the system as a whole.

If you don't hold/know/solely control the private keys, you should be good to go by simply registering and licensing yourself as a normal business in the state of your choosing... for now.
As a business owner, though, you'll need to pay very close attention to new/revised regulations in every state/country where **your users** reside. You never know when one of those states will overreach and attempt to regulate your type of business, as well.

I have yet to receive a sufficient answer to these questions:
How will large centralized payment hubs NOT happen when most businesses are likely to outsource all of their payment processing, and consumers can't simply route around those payment services?
What happens when those payment services -- something like a CoinbaseLN -- also provide services directly to consumers, and every single viable LN route ends up including one or more of those large services?
How can very large businesses ever possibly afford to fund the number of channels necessary to support their massive volume? (Target, Dell, Best Buy, etc)

Lots of opinions, but not very many counter-proposals with specifics and code.

Lightning Network is NOT Bitcoin. It simply uses Bitcoin for funding and settlement.
That said, even with Bitcoin itself being as simple as it is, the vast majority of businesses that use it do so through centralized payment processors -- Coinbase, BitPay, etc.
The same will likely occur with the slightly more complex Lightning Network. Assuming otherwise ignores both history and reality.

I'm just not sure anything like that will even be possible if centralized payment processors plague the entire network!

*If you're doing a hard fork to implement segwit anyways, why not slightly increase the max block size at the same time?*
They'd be very hard-pressed to provide any reasonable answer to that question since they've already admitted that block size still needs to be raised with a hard fork "in the future."

We have NOT seen an "exponential increase in adoption" **by businesses** in the last two years. That stage is yet to come. They're all still trying to figure out what a blockchain is and whether or not they can invent one of their own. The real exponential adoption **by businesses** (especially in the financial sector) won't actually happen until they finally accept the fact that they *can't* make their own and have it work as well as the actual Bitcoin blockchain. Only then will we see them coming online; and, once they finally do start joining the party, the word "exponential" will hardly begin to describe the avalanche that follows.
Claiming that exponential adoption has already happened, or anything even close to it, is ignorant as hell.

The same is obviously not true for Bitcoin.

I guess I just expect adults to make their own decisions, regardless of motivations. Money, by itself, is not a form of coercion.
Of course, there are also times when the righteousness of an act is worth the risk, and money becomes less of a motivation, and more of just a compensation for said risk.
Motivations can be graphed on quad charts using money, religion or justice, pride, and love of [insert anything here... country, family, comrades, etc].
If you want something from someone, find out where they fall on the graph and feed that motivation. ;)

Of course they could; however, doing so alone would have only catered to the few hardcore individuals who know about it. In fact, that's exactly hope it had been with only one or two miners using Peter's original RBF patches.

Get through what now? There's currently no such thing (and no such code) as a "fee market."  
The floating fee code currently in Bitcoin-qt does NOT take into account all of the variables that will be required to determine the necessary fees for every transaction at every given moment; and, nearly every other wallet on the planet uses a fixed-fee setting, or one that merely takes Tx size into account.
So, how will average consumers know what size fee to use in any given transaction? What will they do *when* (not if) their critical transactions get stuck/delayed for hours (or even days)? 
Will we have to manually check some third party service that provides suggested fees at every given moment of the day based on near real-time global volume, your planned transaction size, what other people are paying, and the latest rules miners have chosen for inclusion/prioritization?  How will those factors even be measured?
If you or anyone else thinks a highly competitive "fee market" will be simple and friendly for the average consumer -- at least for the first year or two -- you're really going to be in for quite a shock...
@_date: 2015-06-07 02:11:30
I'm making a comparison that any reasonable consumer would make.
The spreads/fees on BTMs -- all of them -- are just too damn high at this early stage.

Other than that, forget it... I'd rather just plan ahead and save a shit-ton of money.

You realize that they're not "getting rid of" the bitcoin they take in, right?  They're selling it to a new buyer on the open market; which, by definition, is circulating it back into the economy.


You do understand that the *banks* that receive your fiat when you pay a credit card bill are quite often "dumping it for another currency [or asset] altogether," right?  They are also using it to lend, purchase and exchange assets and commodities, and all kinds of other activities that are "within their business model."
What did you think they do with it?  Simply buy more pens attached to chains?
They're cycling it back into the economy in a very similar fashion to Bitpay and Coinbase; and, I'm absolutely certain that, in the future, both of those companies will do many other things that banks do today with the bitcoin they receive.

If you transfer additional coins to a trading exchange a dozen times over the year, and then pull out your higher/lower total pile of coins at a later date, how the hell would the blockchain tell you which coin is which from before they went into the exchange?
My own pile of coins has been around the world and back, in and out of a dozen or more wallets, and in and out of 6-8 different trading exchanges.  I initially used four or five different methods, at different times throughout the year, to acquire those coins. (Cash on localbitcoins, Coinbase, social media tips, mining and trading alt coins, satoshi dice, etc etc).  I also gained or lost fractions of coins a hundred or more times on the trading exchanges.
Please tell me again how the blockchain would provide enough info to determine the cost basis for each and every fraction of coin I acquired during that time?

Another question:  what, exactly, is an "**unauthorized** Virtual Currency transaction"?
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:16:32
Actually, with both Coinbase and Bitpay, I believe each merchant has the option to leave a percentage or fixed max amount of BTC in their account -- with only the remainder above that amount instantly converting to USD.
There's an option that basically says "Always leave _____ BTC in my account.  Convert the rest."

I would still need to manually track and input the origin of my existing coins, and that eventuality does nothing for the hundreds or thousands of transactions each one of us has already done with our coins during the last four years.
@_date: 2014-06-04 05:58:41
Thanks for the compliments. I do some if my best thinking when I'm drinking! LOL
I also think you may be correct on all points.  
Two additional thoughts:  
1) I think that someday there will be millions, or perhaps even billions, of "alt" coins -- wherein perhaps every individual person, community, or company will issue their own.  Those coins will represent or express value, reputation, and individual productivity for each of those entities.  (Ok, this is perhaps a huge reach... science fiction type shit... but I still think it's possible in the future)  
2) Regarding my original questions: My only real fear is that, even if the Googlecoin is initially "fair," a company like Google could/would use their vast resources to manipulate the markets for it since they'd have a vested interest (branding) in its success.
Ok, need another beer... :)

SecondMarket won't be selling any of their coin anytime soon, if ever.

A "fee market" is the fantasy naysayers have wherein everyone gets to resend their transactions over and over again until they bid high enough to finally get their transaction into the next block.
While such a market may be inevitable once the block reward no longer supports mining, it's wayyyy too early to develop such a market. 
I wholeheartedly believe that the subsequent delayed transactions, messy wallet implementations, and all-around headaches caused by a premature fee market will scare off most potential adopters.

Anyone complaining about the amounts being too small is missing the entire point.
That is, even the smaller amounts will eventually lead to more valuable and worthwhile discourse, and they will also add up to a decent amount IF a commenter frequently contributes more worthwhile comments.

I'm actually struggling with how I'm going to pay for and accomplish the development of a custom, web-based, real-time transparency (RTT) UI and wallet, so my plan is to reach out to each of them to see what their integrators suggest.
My ultimate decision will likely be based upon their response to that issue moreso than the fees, but it would certainly help if they eliminate the fees altogether.
I'm also trying to dig up some philanthropic venture capital, so there's that challenge, as well.
Wish me luck! ;)
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:39:10
Great, thanks!  For some reason, it read to me like they might have modified it slightly.

You honestly don't see wallets being filled with coins that originated from all over the place?
The ability to move coins around all over the place, and receive them in 1000 different ways, is one of the core benefits of Bitcoin.  I definitely disagree that such coins will be a minority.
If I privately send you 1 BTC as payment for a foot massage, how will Coinbase or Bitpay know what to do with that coin?  How will they know that it's the first time you've owned that coin yourself, and that it didn't just arrive from another one of your own wallets?  Will you have to manually tell them for each and every deposit?  And then, what exactl do you tell them when you don't know the original value of a specific coin (output) from your personal cold storage?
You think consumers will enjoy having to worry about all of that for every satoshi they ever receive?  no f'n chance... it's borderline asinine to envision tracking all that information.

Actually, if Bitcoin fails, another crypto currency will almost certainly take its place.  But, that probably won't be any of the alt coins that exist right now...

I personally disagree based on the concept of demand, but you could be right.
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:11:57


I'm perfectly ok with that because their fees are *much* more reasonable; and, Bitcoin processors don't encourage, or even allow for, a debt-based society.
Forcing people to live within their means versus taking on endless high-interest debt is a beautiful thing.

There are walls of various sizes, and for various reasons, on the exchanges every day.  
The November / December spike was driven by two distinct factors:  media hype and new Chinese users buying like crazy.  Everything else, and everyone else, simply followed.
I've heard and seen some bot code that involves placing walls, but most do it.  Since walls are often very large, and very dangerous to deploy, they're usually handled manually by very skilled traders who never sleep.  lol
The reason they're "dangerous" and require very attentive monitoring is that even larger whales may come along and eat the walls in order to accomplish their own goals and market movement.
There are also very rare occasions when market momentum itself is enough to chew through a large wall in an instant -- which is why the whales who use them never sleep without *very loud* market alarms!
It's kinda fun to watch walls get annihilated when you imagine the owners running back to their keyboards mumbling "oh, fuck...."  :)

DAO = Distributed Autonomous Organization, and DAC = Distributed Autonomous Corporation (or Community).

The possibilities are really endless, though.

You're assuming that the entire concept of power and influence won't itself adapt to the new paradigm.
Percentage of controlled mining power, highest percentage of coin ownership, etc... these may simply take the place of controlling the fiat reserve currency -- in terms of global control and influence.

Why am I an ass?

You or I could set up an exchange in those states by simply mailing a few easy forms to the Federal government.
Does the fact that I'm not overly impressed offend you in some way?  
I do like VoS, and I'm looking forward to them making some *real* progress in the U.S, but that doesn't mean I'm going to ignore the fact that South Carolina is literally the lowest hanging regulatory fruit in the entire country.

Counter point:  their businesses also depend upon public acceptance of, and confidence in, crypto currencies.

"Network effect" -- two words used together -- also has an entirely different meaning than just "network" by itself.
It's a marketing term describing the power of word-of-mouth, or the spread of a tech or idea.
Read your original post again and you'll see that just using network by itself didn't make sense at all.
After all, Bitcoin has the most powerful network in history.

They absolutely DO apply to cointip, changetip, dogetipbot, or any other entity that potentially holds coins, and facilitates transactions for, all NY residents and businesses (and soon many other states when they mirror the NY regs).
For example, unless they can afford to become *fully* NYDFS compliant (which I doubt), Changetip will now need to implement AML/KYC to both identify and **deny** services to all NY residents.  Failure to do so would risk prosecution.
The same holds true for every bitcoin exchange or hosted wallet service (ie. Changetip) **in the entire world**, and all of them risk prosecution (similar to offshore gambling sites) if they fail to comply.
You're wrong to downplay the significance of these regs, or the impact they'll undoubtedly have on every exchange and hosted wallet service in the world.

There are countless ways to obtain bitcoin -- cash buys, bank transfers, mining alt coins, faucets, gambling, trades on exchanges, gifts, etc etc -- and, each and every one of those methods creates hundreds or thousands of new cost bases.  Many of those events can involve very tiny fractions of coins that will each have their own cost basis.  Hell, many of those sources don't even exist anymore!
If I buy a t-shirt online tomorrow using my main wallet, there would literally be hundreds of cost basis calculations involved in that single purchase due to the many different ways I built up my pile of coins over just the last year.
No software in the world will be able to automagically calculate any of that for users like me.  I would have to do all of it manually... which is essentially impossible.
A software solution can work for users who only use one source for all of their buys, sells, and storage.  However, the entire concept quickly breaks down the moment you begin shuffling coins around and/or combining them from a thousand different types of sources.
I've kept immaculate records of my straight-forward trades made on exchanges, but that does nothing for me since I also used countless other methods to obtain and spend coins all over the planet during the exact same period.  Now that I've combined them back into two wallets (one hot, one cold), my meager piles are way beyond any reasonable accounting methods.  Seriously, there's no chance in hell... boom!  Instant non-compliance!  Swell...

"To put it frankly," you're flat wrong about almost everything you've written.
1. Not only did I discover Willy, I studied his activity very closely, every day in real time, for well over a month.  
2. Gox did not lead the rally in November. Gox followed China *almost every day.*  There were times when the major whales in Gox would kick things off with a big buy or sell (hundreds of coins), but China always took the lead in either direction soon after.  And, of course, none of those big buys were ever done by Willy since he never once purchased more than 20 btc at a time.  
3. More coins were traded in China during any given week than Willy accumulated, in total, during its entire existence.  
4. Willy did NOT move the market on Gox in an upward direction. At best, Willy kept it perfectly level sometimes -- *but only during the lulls when nobody else was trading.*   Otherwise, Willy's small buys were very tiny drops in the very large bucket being traded during November.  
The report that was later published by someone else should never have put forth any "conclusions," and those of us who actually watched and understood what Willy was doing, in real time, know the truth.
I sincerely don't give a flying fuck if you read the report and think you know what you're talking about.  You're still absolutely wrong in every way, so I will continue to debunk your gross misunderstandings every time I see you post them...
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:41:58
You do realize that you don't actually store bitcoins themselves on your storage devices, right?  So, unless you're running a full node, you could fit every set of private keys you ever create on an old 3.5" floppy disk!  LOL
Better yet, convert your keys to a paper wallet, delete your wallet.dat file, and you won't have to store them on ANY other media ever again.
You could also simply memorize a 12-word seed, and you won't even need the paper ever again!

Or, perhaps they're doing what all *traders* should be doing with coins that are kept on an exchange:  they're selling and hoping that the price drops lower so that they can buy back in at the lower price -- therefore increasing the number of coins in their wallets.

I have run businesses, which is exactly how I know that the new "calculate CGT every time you use it as simple currency" rule will be overly burdensome on ALL businesses who have considered holding and using the coin themselves.
They don't have to do the ridiculous extra CGT accounting for cash, PayPal, checks, or credit cards, so this will make them think twice about ever accepting AND HOLDING bitcoin -- especially small businesses that don't have the accounting expertise or ability to afford new "bitcoin accounting software or services."
The IRS just implemented rules on bitcoin that will make it near impossible for both consumers and small businesses that use bitcoin as currency to stay in compliance.  Period.
This CGT tracking will have to become a free service provided by bitcoin payment processors, or merchants and other businesses will never bother completing the Bitcoin loop by holding and using it to pay employees/suppliers.

It's now essentially useless as a day-to-day currency and payment system in the U.S. -- which, if you'll recall, is/was the primary intent of Bitcoin when Satoshi created it.  "Electronic cash," he called it.

Then, in your strong opinion, you believe that tomorrow the price of BTC will be $500. Theoretically you could transfer in that one Bitcoin, get $635 BitDollars, then when the BTC price plummets to $500 you could convert your $635 in BitDollars into Bitcoin, and end up with more Bitcoin!

Same here.  I had several colleagues looking to buy in, so I was going to sell them BTC using the instant buy feature... 10k per week average.

Tagging them with an easily recognizable bitcoin transaction makes it easier to track their inputs/outputs afterwards.  It has nothing at all to do with the text tags on blockchain.info, and it's infinitely more efficient than trying to track them with a pen and paper.

They're are, in fact, already "regulated" in 48 out of 50 states that require you to register as a Money Services Business (MSB) in order to operate bitcoin ATMs.  You also need to adhere to the Federal AML and KYC regulations in all 50 states.

Well, for starters, people don't "buy things" or pre-order items on Kickstarter, so I probably shouldn't have used that as an example to begin with.  On Kickstarter, you're actually just investing in the start-up with various rewards for doing so.  More often than not, said retreats include their planned product or service.
Pre-ordering tech gadgets is actually more similar to pre-ordering a video game -- many of which also experience delays.

Better yet, have the guy who originally lost it be the one who has combed the same stretch of beach with the metal detector for 20 years.

When bitcoin is simply held and used as a store of value, or even just traded back and forth on exchanges for gains, it behaves as a "property" or "commodity." (like gold or stock)
However, it's extremely unique in this day and age in that it can ALSO be used as a day-to-day currency for the simple purchase of goods and services.
In that way, it's a hybrid of both asset categories -- which is why attempting to force it into the mold of just one or the other won't work.
If the entire government is limiting their options to just one or the other categories, then the very best we could ever hope for is to leave it categorized as a "property" while also allowing for a capital gains exemption up to $X.  (Where X is a very high number, ie. 5 digits or more)
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:46:28
calculating the actual cost-per-transaction involves hashing power (Gh/s), energy costs ($ per kWh), and tx per second -- NOT the current value of the block reward divided by the number of tx per block.
The miners actually EARN ~$44 per tx in gross revenue (using $16,000/300), but the COST to process each of those tx is only ~$4 in real expenses.
Edit: there was a thread here detailing all the math just yesterday, I'll see if I can dig it up.

I'm sorry if you misunderstood, but this idea isn't meant to create some sort of mandatory reporting or tracking. The use of such a function can/should be completely optional for every user -- IOW, you could turn the tracking on/off, and you could import and export the information *as needed.*
Many U.S. bitcoiners recognize that we need this functionality, but I haven't yet seen any serious discussion of how we should standardize it.
I also agree with you that this is a *very* unfortunate consequence of the IRS' lame "guidelines."  Trust me, I really wish they had never forced this bullshit requirement on U.S. users... but here we are.  :(

Elliott Wave is f'n snake oil.  You can thank a preacher nicknamed DanV for all the EW believers in the bitcoin trading community.  The irony is that he doesn't even trade bitcoin, but he keeps putting out new EW charts every week with lower and lower projected lows.
The sad truth is that half of the bears in the trading community have been drinking his koolaid for months, so some of the downward trend was partially/probably caused by them trying to turn DanV's charts into a self-fulfilling prophecy.  (just my theory)
His latest and greatest prediction has us hitting as low as 150-200 before any real bull run past the ATH can happen.
Back in January, he predicted 450, then 350 in March... then 250... and now 150.

The core devs would like you (or your software) to *guess* what your ever-increasing allocated fees should be each and every time you *try* to transfer bitcoin on the Bitcoin network itself.
They've even pushed extra hard this month to implement full Replace-By-Fee (RBF) so that you can be sure to keep raising your fees after your first guesses fail miserably on a consistent basis and your coins get stuck in zero-conf purgatory.
Several of them would also *absolutely love it* if most of your fees go to Lightning Network (LN) node operators, rather than actual bitcoin miners, because who wants or needs so many actual bitcoin transactions on the blockchain anyways? Amirite, or amirite?! 
Yeah, so... enjoy your shiny new fee market.
@_date: 2015-12-23 04:36:38
So you're ok with the main blockchain itself becoming *unusable* for transferring anything less than $1000, or for any fees less than $50?
I'm obviously using random numbers to make my point; but, answer me this: are you perfectly ok with the main blockchain becoming a settlement network reserved for large corporations and the ultra-wealthy to *only* transfer very large sums of cash?

Fair enough. I don't recall the devs ever even bothering to seek consensus on a SW+2MB option, though. 
Why is that?
I think they'd easily discover near universal consensus for such a fork, so it's interesting that they're not even bothering to try...

You didn't answer my question. (Shocker).
Bitcoin isn't "supposed to be" anything.  It's an extremely unique innovation in that it's simultaneously a payment and asset-transfer network (or protocol), a commodity that acts as a store of value, AND a "foreign" currency.
Also, what makes you think that the act of processing/converting bitcoin to fiat ISN'T circulating the coins back into the economy?  In fact, that conversion prices does exactly that, and it's the exact same thing the credit card processors do with your fiat once you pay your bill with the currency of your choice.
Again, though, you completely failed to address my previous question.  Do online retailers accept euros, dollars, yuan, etc, or do they not?

You forgot a few very important aspects of this "wonderful" proposal:
1) any crypto exchange or hot wallet service **on the entire planet** that does not meet all NYDFS regulations must identify and block access to all NY residents and businesses, or face international prosecution.
2) both parties in every transaction must be fully identified.  That's right, if I send someone coins from a NYDFS-compliant ewallet, I need to provide them with the full contact info for the recipient!  If someone sends me coins from a NYDFS-compliant ewallet, they will have to give them all of **my** info (even though I'm not a customer of said service)... this part is mad fucked up!
3) in New York, it's illegal to create open source alt coins, operate or use mixing services, or invent any other crypto transferring innovations without a fully compliant (and cost prohibitive) BitLicense.
4) There is no minimum threshold, so even elegant solutions for micro-transactions, like Changetip, must now completely reinvent themselves and implement full AML/KYC.  Why?  Because everyone knows that terrorists prefer to launder money five cents at a time, that's why!
5) don't even think about creating and testing a new relevant innovation in your basement without first getting a BitLicense.  Any New York resident involved in a global open source project to develop any of the above must personally obtain a BitLicense, as well.  lolno.
6) You will obey, or else we'll bend you stupid nerds over like @_date: 2014-06-03 02:17:26

Consensus amongst whom?  That's the question.

For that reason, his Department claims they are exempt from filling a jobs impact statement... Seriously?
Anyways, I sincerely hope you're right and I'm wrong.  I honestly don't think he's on our side at all in terms of privacy or supporting startups in this space.
Also, don't forget that during the hearings, Lawsky also stated that, (paraphrasing) given the choice between stamping out money laundering and allowing 1000 flowers [startups] to bloom, he'd choose the anti-money laundering hammer every time.

Yes, but that also means *you* only paid $4.75, total USD, for that $25 t-shirt (plus any applicable sales tax).

They're being short-sighted, though.  Discouraging consumer spending when the economy is in shambles is a HORRIBLE idea.  They'd be much better off allowing the realized gains to go untaxed, and then accepting the taxes on the merchant revenue, and more money would be circulating in the retail economy.

The average soldier works 50-60 hours per week (minimum).  A newly enlisted E1 makes just over $18k per year.  Even if we're super-conservative on the hours, and go with 50, that would mean they make roughly $7.20 per hour -- which is half of what Los Angeles wants as minimum wage!
The math (with two weeks off for vacation): 18000/(50*50) = 7.20
That's just insane given their workload; so, it's criminal that the government imposes their will on businesses with minimum wage laws while simultaneously under-paying the service members so dramatically.

Resistance and support points, or sell and buy walls, are naturally occurring aspects of any market.  Most of them change frequently, or quickly, but still others do persist for quite some time.
Getting past those is also the primary method by which any market moves dramatically up or down.
The bitcoin market is primarily news driven, so big news events will result in momentum in either direction.  Today, the market lacks the momentum, or incentive, necessary to move quickly up or down, so we're experiencing sideways movement.
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:00:36
Walls are extremely high amounts of money placed as a bid at certain price points, or extremely high amounts of bitcoin placed as asks at other price points -- which essentially creates upper and lower boundaries that prevent the price moving beyond those points.
If the walls are large enough on both sides of the trades, the price will only bounce between them.  Others are forced to place their smaller bids and asks between those walls, thus allowing whoever wants to accumulate or dump to purchase a large number of coins, or sell a large number of coins, in that small price range.
In this case, the major walls have been moved around for five weeks to allow for a ton of buying and selling between $575 and $600 USD.
If you watch long enough, and closely enough, you can actually see individual walls being moved around by the "whales" who own them.
Some of the whales even have private chat rooms wherein they coordinate all of the above 24/7.
The person (a known whale) I spoke with last week said his contracted task was to buy X amount of coins in that price range.  He used his personal holdings, along with several others who are doing the same, as strategic walls in order to make it happen.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:55:36
Yes, because the average consumer wants to manually import and calculate all of that for every single purchase when their collection of coins is made up of cash buys, mining, Coinbase orders, exchange trades, Satoshi dice, social media tips, gifts, bitcoin faucets, or the endless number of other methods used to accumulate a pile of random coins.
Even using software to try to track all that would require countless hours of research and manual entry -- especially if you have your coins broken up into multiple wallets of various types.

Wrong, Tim Draper bought those coins to act as the liquidity basis for his Bitcoin businesses throughout the world.  He also personally owns an unknown amount for himself, as an investment.
More importantly, though, the ETFs won't be limited to "a raft of smalltime hedge fund managers from Ohio."  If done correctly, they will be available to every Joe Citizen in the U.S. via retirement accounts and direct trading accounts (ie. ETrade, Ameritrade, etc).
Personally, I plan to point at least 5% of my 401k toward the funds if/when they become available.
Now, imagine just for a minute if a few million other Americans do the same...
As for Wall Street, I believe the NYDFS has stated that they have 80+ applications for BitLicenses awaiting approval once the regs are released.  That's 80+ entities in New York that are looking to open up exchanges, Bitcoin ATM businesses, etc.
Now, who do you think some of those applications belong to?  Oh yeah, probably Wall Street investment firms, trading houses, etc.
The Bitcoin 101 classes taught at the Bitcoin Center in New York, located on Wall Street, have been filed to capacity for months.  Those students were more often than not the traders and bankers working on Wall Street itself.

Why what?  When you transfer the money to an investment account, the money is deposited to the fund's account, not yours -- which is exactly what happens when you send it to a company like Coinbase.
Why is one classified as gambling, but the other is not?  All currency, stock, and commodity trading involves risk, so wouldn't an ING account be essentially the same as a Coinbase account?  Is there some sort of volatility threshold in the law that I'm unaware of?

That's not exactly what it means.  If they keep some bitcoin for payroll and suppliers, neither of those would be considered "investments."
Profit investing refers to a very specific pile of money.  There are plenty of ways to hold bitcoin in other piles, so I think most people are misinterpreting that part of the proposal.  It could definitely stand some new language for clarification, though.

I would argue that allowing (and even encouraging) the government to move in on bitcoin will make it nearly impossible to wrest control back from them once they're fully entrenched.

Loans can be handled using escrow and automated arbitration.  Contracts, or loans, can use collateral that is itself held in the blockchain -- such as the cryptographic private keys that represent ownership of a house, car, boat, etc.  That way, if you fail to pay back a private anonymous loan that I give you, I gain undeniable ownership of one or more of those possessions.

I know of only one case where it happened.  Very interesting project being discussed here:  


- Current Storage Space: 1,350 Terra Bytes.  
- Current # of Hard Drives: 225 Seagate STBD6000100 6 TB drives (and 10 250 Gig SSD's for redundant OS drives)  
- Current Chassis: Custom built clone of the 45 drives Storinator.  
- % of all addresses stored: 0.00000000000000000000000000000009066% (rough estimate, our calculator does not have enough space to get the actual figure)


A: Theoretically yes, but the odds are very slim, we do have a way of monitoring addresses in the database and in the past 2 months we have only seen 1 positive balance come through, of which was positive balances for less than 1 hour which lead us to believe they were part of a mixing or tumbling service sequence. No we didnt steal it, and never would. we have enough bitcoin that we dont need to. This is for fun, not for malicious purposes.
This is actually an attack vector that rarely gets discussed because the current cost of generating and storing addresses is too high to make it worth it from a criminal/nefarious perspective.
That can certainly change if/when there are any crazy breakthroughs in storage capacities.
No bullshit.

There is always a threshold every business must face, but the benefits of growth *usually* outweigh the benefits of remaining smaller.

I understand the issue well enough; however, you're using plurals.  As far as the world knows right now, Gox is the only exchange that is KNOWN to suffer from this problem because they failed to account for it in their processes/code.

That discussion was wonderful to watch.  I particularly enjoyed watching the Georgetown law professor struggling the entire time to articulate how/why regulators have the seemingly impossible task of imposing 20th century regulations on this obviously 21st century technology!  He was certainly sharp enough to realize that the polygonal shape of Bitcoin doesn't fit into any previous round or square holes that current regulators have in their arsenal.  The simple fact that he's smart enough to realize that is actually pretty encouraging.
That said, since I'm in the neighborhood, I think I'll reach out to the Atlantic Council to try and help them out with their analyses of this issue.  I truly appreciate their focus on disruptive technologies and disruption in general, so it should be fun! :)

With Apple Pay, Apple is only taking a small cut off whatever the banks are charging in merchant fees.  
Perhaps Apple could work it out with Coinbase to take the same small fraction of the 1% that Coinbase charges merchants?

Actually, I believe the claim was that he was working with someone else who created Willy to support their scheme (whatever that was), and that multiple shell companies were involved.

You really need to define "ease of use."  Does that mean faster?  More intuitive?  Or what?  Also, how can you use "credit cards" and "safer" in the same sentence while keeping a straight face?
Bitcoin transactions take seconds to do both on and offline, and the additional benefits -- no personal information, pushed instead of pulled payments, full personal control, deflationary nature, etc -- make them a much more attractive option... to me.
It's ridiculous to claim that credit cards are "safer," unless you're only referring to chargebacks.  Given incidents like the hack at Target, I think it's quite obvious that credit cards are the least secure financial systems in the world.

Correct. 
I think you made two mistakes here:
1) the gambling, obviously.  
2) thinking that bitcoin was a short-term investment with a quick return, or that it always just goes up.
By now, I'm sure your research has taught you that bitcoin only goes up dramatically every 6-8 months (historically), and that expecting it to go up continuously (and quickly) after you bought it was rather naive. 
I can see by some of your posts here that you're already turning the corner and using this as a valuable lesson (or multiple lessons), which is awesome!  Best of luck to you!

Not to mention the ATM's additional fees (if any)... it might beat localbitcoins for both fees and convenience, and Coinbase for convenience alone, but it's certainly not as useful as I had hoped.
At least there's no (consumer-side) fees for normal merchant transactions... I guess that's a plus?
One thing that might make this with it for me:  the ability to use said debit system to pay all personal bills online like you can do with most checking accounts.  They haven't mentioned that service, but I really hope it's in the pipeline!

I really wish I could, but I haven't programmed much in over 10 years.  :(
I imagine that it may be as simple as prioritizing micro-charity payments as their own separate output in every transaction (maybe similar to how mining fees are processed?).  Of course, this would be something that is completely optional for every wallet user (and every wallet app).
It may be easier to lobby the larger wallet developers to include it as an option for every user during initial setup.  The users could be prompted with something like *"Do you wish to donate btc to a charity with every transaction?"*  If yes, then they're asked for an amount and presented with a drop-down menu to select a participating charity OR they could enter some sort of URL, bitcoin address, or ID code for the charity of their choice. (Edit: Wouldn't even need to be charity... it could be their daughter's college fund account, etc)
Those micro-payments could then get prioritized in each block using some core function well beyond my expertise.
Essentially, I'd simply like to have this conversation with the core devs.  I even considered volunteering to speak at Bitcoin in the Beltway on this very subject, but I never followed through.
Can you imagine the PR from *"Bitcoin version 1.0 released today -- the first currency in the history of mankind with a built-in charity feature!"*?
That's my dream...
Edit:  if you think it's a realistic possibility, please send me a PM to continue the conversion!
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:45:25
I hope you realize that it's the old fiat system that causes most of that delay, not the bitcoin system.   The bank transfers are slow as hell.  Also, once you're fully verified at Coinbase and link a credit card as backup, there are higher instant buy limits (up to $1000/day) without any delay whatsoever.

Actually, I think that bitcoin eventually becoming the basis (or protocol) for managing, securing, and transmitting much more valuable assets will be a more likely scenario, and have a much more profound impact, in 5-10 years.

Generalizations are cool. /s
There is a huge difference between merely *accepting* limited/reasonable regulations, and *inviting* ever-increasing direct government intervention.
Jeremy Allaire is out there doing the latter.
If he had his way, each and every bitcoin transaction by a U.S. citizen would be tracked, attributed, and provided to FinCEN for analysis.
Your assumption that everyone who wants some anonymity and a lack of government insight into every aspect of our lives has something to hide is severely flawed.  
I pay all my taxes, I'm not a criminal, I don't do drugs, I don't gamble, and I don't launder money -- yet, I'd be A LOT happier if the government left me (and bitcoin) completely alone.  I'm realistic enough to know that won't happen, so I'd also support anyone who understands and accepts LIMITED regulations -- while fighting really hard to limit and curb those regulations at every turn.
However, I cannot and will not tolerate those who come into this space and then proceed to call for more and more regulations in an obvious attempt to make *themselves* richer at the expense of everyone else' rights.
Mark my words, Jeremy Allaire, and other statists like him, are a cancer on bitcoin in the U.S.

It's different in each and every state -- 47 of which require you to apply for a money transmitting license, with each state having various -- and often very expensive -- capital requirements.  Most of the state license requirements include millions of dollars in insurance bonds and additional hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash reserves (per machine).
On top of that, all ATM operators must register with the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), as well, and remain compliant with all of their anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) laws.  That prices is usually just some paperwork and a small fee, but the AML/KYC requirements are burdensome and eternal throughout the life of the company.
Good luck!  :(

First, not everyone "starts with dollars."  
Second, the money is sent through the *credit card payment processing network* before arriving at the merchant bank account in whatever currency that merchant prefers.
In this case, for the sake of this discussion, bitcoin is a currency like any other.   Francs, euros, dollars, yuan... bitcoin -- the payer's currency of choice is practically irrelevant.
Coinbase and Bitpay are the equivalent of Visa and MasterCard -- except that Bitpay and Coinbase are, of course, much much faster :).
You're also not bitcoining properly if you begin every transaction in dollars.

My solution would involve CGT any time the coins are directly exchanged for fiat.  However, the IRS is failing to the see the bigger picture that allowing CGT-free use in commerce would be hugely beneficial in the flailing economy.  
They'd still get their piece of the merchant revenue; but, by curbing bitcoin's use as a currency, they're actually stifling consumer spending in a time when all areas of commerce could really use a boost -- especially retail.
I also believe the IRS took the lazy way out by stuffing crypto currencies into one of their old asset categories, rather than making the extra effort to create something new and modern to match the unique nature of Bitcoin itself.
They should have created an entirely new hybrid asset category for crypto, but they didn't... so here we are.
These guidelines stifle both innovation and spending, which is really truly a tremendous shame.
They had a chance to modernize both themselves and the world, and they f'n blew it.

You should note that I both discovered and named the Willy bot (Edit: with the helpful suggestion from a friend -- see post below mine). I did not write the report everyone has seen since, but I studied Willy's market activity for weeks... in real time.
The data does NOT disagree.
The Willy bot did NOT drive the price movements in October to December last year; and yes, the Chinese led almost every daily rise during that entire time.  
The real whales on Gox certainly helped provide support and momentum to follow China all the way to the top, but the Willy bot had little or nothing to do with those rises.
Willy was an extremely slow moving accumulation bot that provided volume during lulls in the trading at Gox, but he certainly didn't push the price anywhere.
It's tiresome to have to explain this all the time; but, many people have misinterpreted the data in the report, so you're not alone in your misunderstanding.

That's the point.  Consumers cannot and should not be expected to calculate CGT when they buy lunch or a laptop.  That's overly burdensome and essentially destroys the "ease of use" case for bitcoin as a currency.
Also, what happens when a miner earns a bitcoin that is worth $30 at the moment he mines it, he holds it for a year, and then buys that same $585 laptop from Tigerdirect?  Since that initial coin was already taxed as income, does he or does he not also have a CGT obligation when he purchases the laptop?  At what point does his coin become a capital asset versus income?  
What is his income coins are now worth less than the day he mined them?  How/where does he account for that loss for tax purposes?
Face it, since the IRS took the lazy way out, it's all an incomprehensible mess now.

All relevant concerns.  See how easy that was to type them out, rather than just constantly trolling with community insults?
The use cases for bitcoin will mostly be driven by lower fees, added privacy (if desired), and less friction, period.
The core developers will soon by better crowd-funded through platforms like Lighthouse, along with subsidies from the largest players like Coinbase, Xapo, Circle, Bitpay, etc.
The core devs just merged floating fees for miners.  It'll be interesting to see how the free market and miners treat those now that they'll be an option.
These regulations will be the most talked about issue for quite some time to come, and many people are mobilizing to get involved in the comment process to make our voices heard.  Hell, even new lobbying groups are being created!

Wrong answer.  There are currently almost 600 broken transactions involving 13,000+ BTC, and some have waited 6+ days for them to be resent.

I sincerely hope you're right; but, that doesn't mean that, even if these draconian regs only apply to NY-based businesses, we won't end up with fractional markets wherein every company, everywhere, will only be able to provide services to people living in certain states.
In other words, regardless of their own state's regulations, bitcoin exchanges and hosted wallets based in California (or anywhere else on the planet) will still need to use AML/KYC to identify and deny service to all NY residents (if the service isn't otherwise 100% NYDFS compliant).
That means that every such service, everywhere, will have to pick and choose which U.S. residents they can actually provide service to.

Therein lies the biggest flaw -- the entire point of crypto currencies is/was to remove as much control as possible from nation state central authorities, not to simply mimic or reinvent their current practices in some new and shiny way that leaves them in compete control... again.
What you are suggesting already exists, just without the crypto and blockchain:  GLD ETFs. 
Governments around the world have proven themselves completely untrustworthy, especially when it comes to money.
What you're suggesting is a simple return to a gold standard with a little bit of crypto laid on top just for shits and giggles.
I've heard it all before, and I sincerely hope it never happens.
Edit: nation states are perfectly welcome to peg their own currencies to the value of bitcoin, though -- perhaps in the form of side chains, coins with merge mining, etc... that would be killer.

Unless, you know, you're a trader... or something.
Here's a spoiler:  coin trading on the major exchanges determines the current value of YOUR bitcoin (the prices used by most merchant services).
Are you suggesting that traders transfer their coins out every night they go to bed?  What if their plan is to sleep in fiat?  What if they're margin trading over a longer period of time?
Your advice is therefore kinda silly, isn't it?  Here's what you should have written:

**Fiat:**  excessive delays measured in days, ridiculously high fees with multiple middlemen, susceptible to bank or government control and confiscation, unlimited and inflationary, obviously not programmable.
**Bitcoin:** delays measured in minutes not days, ultra low fees or none, cannot be controlled or confiscated by anyone without user consent, scarce and deflationary, a protocol that's programmable and expandable (in terms of features and functions)

You, and perhaps too many others, are looking at the whole situation backwards.
This is a great opportunity and olive branch for the citizens of those troubled nations, not for any of us or Bitcoin itself.

The part that pisses me off is the section about "investor income and wealth" verification.

**exactly!**  In the scenario above, you'd be paying CG on the $555 difference.  That additional cost will be determined by the length of time the specific 1.0 bitcoin was in your possession -- so, either long or short term capital gains rates.

There is also the possibility that, by 2140, there will be mining centers run by governments (paid for with taxes) to maintain the vitality of the network.

Wrong.  He presented two options to leverage "Bitcoin technology" to overcome what he considers the primary issue -- that being the issue of transaction attribution, or lack thereof.
The two options he presented are:  
1) *"add to it"* -- by which he means adding attribution mechanisms **on top of Bitcoin itself**  
OR  
2) *"build a similar technology"* -- by which he means porting the blockchain technology to a new creation that has built-in attribution.
He clearly stated that it could go either way, and that either/both could be amazing; and, he was also quite clear about transaction attribution being his primary concern.
At no point did he state or imply that the currency should be separated from the technology.  In fact, by centering the entire discussion on his concerns about money laundering and terrorism, **his entire focus was on the currency aspects of Bitcoin, not just the blockchain.**

People keep saying that it will be easy to calculate, track, and report the daily gains and losses using the blockchain software, but that's simply not the case.
I sat down and tried to figure out the thousands of individual cost bases for my meager pile of a few dozen coins; but, I gave up after 45 minutes when I realized that it's an impossible task.
There are endless ways to acquire bitcoin in every minute amount imaginable, and millions of off-chain transactions aren't found in the blockchain -- just those two facts alone make the task of tracking cost bases for every coin you ever send or receive completely unrealistic.
To make matters worse, do you really think the rest of the world is going to put forth any effort or implement any standards just to help U.S. users?  HA!  Yeah right!

That's not how it works, though.  You don't get to pick and choose which cost basis to use for each purchase -- not legally, anyways.  
My OP demonstrates that many purchases will involve multiple cost bases.  
Imagine having 0.5 BTC that is comprised of 25+ separate acquisitions (ie. through trading very small amounts on Cryptsy).  
Since you now have 25+ different price bases, you would literally need to calculate the CGT 25+ times for a single 0.5 BTC purchase using those coins.
I hope you can see that, even with software, this quickly becomes unworkable since you would need to manually tell that software the entire history of all your fractions of coins.

The Director of the U.S.Mint had this to say today:  
"Also because gold bullion coins are made by the United States Mint, they are legal tender that has to be accepted at its face value.  However, it would not be advisable spend a $50 dollar gold bullion coin that weighs one ounce and is worth $1,310 at today’s prices.  Further, the Constitution of the United States allows for gold and silver to be used as an alternate currency.  So states like Utah have made it legal to use gold coins as currency at market value without capital gains taxes.  Unfortunately the Constitution does not allow for bitcoin as an alternative currency but does offer an interesting precedent"

My biggest points of contention:  
1) The creation of alt-coins in New York requires a BitLicense.  This includes any New York resident or business participating in global open source alt-coin projects, or projects that involve hosted wallets or exchanges of any kind.  
2) New Yorkers can't conduct business or be affiliated with any business that doesn't have a physical address, so DACs and DAOs are completely off limits.  So much for Bitcoin 2.0 innovation!  
3) All hosted wallets and exchanges **in the world** that are not fully NYDFS compliant are expected to identify and block all NY customers. (Goodbye Changetip!)  
4) The bond requirements don't scale, so small startups won't be able to afford BitLicenses.  
5) businesses are prevented from keeping any profits in bitcoin, and are forced to keep them in USD or USD derivatives instead. So much for closing the loop with suppliers! And, while it's now perfectly legal for anyone in the U.S. to invest in bitcoin itself, that's no longer true for Bitcoin-based businesses themselves... say wut?! O.o  
6) The section on required capital reserves isn't specific at all, so once again startups will likely be stifled.  The required amounts will be dictated on a case by case basis by Herr Lawsky himself.  
7) users of BitLicensed services are expected to provide the personal identifying information for **any** entity they use said service to send bitcoin to.  This is only one step shy of Coinvalidation, so it's a real killer.  Those of us who wish to maintain a little privacy will now have to ask people not to send us coins from such services.  
8) All businesses must keep full logs, including full names and addresses for all senders AND recipients, for 10 years.  Seems a little excessive, don't ya think?  
9) all licensed businesses must keep a fully certified compliance officer on staff, including startups.  
10) All businesses are expected to file Suspicious Activity Reports and all transfers of over $10k to the NYDFS **and** FinCEN.  Banks don't even have that requirement in the New York -- they only report those to FinCEN!  
There are actually many other examples of these draconian measures throughout the regs, but the above are the worst offenders in my opinion.  The entire proposal lacks clarity and forethought, including the definition of which types of businesses this applies to.
Oh, and did I mention that current licensed banks and money transmitters are exempt from all of the above?  Including the very bitcoin-specific aspects?  Gee, I wonder why that is.

@_date: 2014-08-01 14:50:30
That's already the case.  You're already supposed to know and abide by the laws of any local jurisdiction you pass through.
This is why you can't buy weed in Colorado and bring it back to Arizona to smoke, or why you can't buy a handgun in Virginia and then drive through DC with the gun tucked in your belt.
Limiting law enforcement, taxation, and law creation to the local level allows much more direct influence and involvement for the citizens of that locale.
Example:  it's much easier to convince your local sheriff that you snorting heroin in your living room isn't harming anyone than it is for you to convince 2/3 of Congress and the POTUS.
For that reason, it's also much easier to lobby for and build roads in your specific neighborhood if all of your tax money goes to your local county (or city), rather than to the IRS to be distributed nationwide.

Ok, it sounds like you'll just make it, and I'm glad to see you're remaining level-headed about it a bit more than in your first post.
"Never look back" is a HUGE lesion to learn for traders, and is also one of the toughest.  Missed opportunities should indicate nothing more than the fact that they happen frequently, so that also means new opportunities will come along, as well.  I've had more than my share of losses and missed opportunities with crypto, so I can definitely relate!
That said, I think you know that investing everything is/was a bad idea when you need money in the short-term.  Both BTC and LTC are primarily long investments, so they should be treated that way and you should only invest what you really can afford to lose.
Keep your head up and don't be afraid to take a loss in order to cover your real life responsibilities!

The entire problem is that bitcoin is not just a currency OR a property -- it's both.  Any legislation or other regulations that attempt to treat it as just one or the other will be detrimental to its use in one way or another.

I honestly believe the switch to the virtual office address was for mail only and done entirely for security/safety purposes.  If they actually move the servers and desks, it will likely be to a completely different undisclosed location.
Either that, or they're preparing for bankruptcy and liquidation of assets.  The problem is that nobody really knows except them... (and perhaps a few whale insiders).

In other words, you're doing it wrong... which pretty much explains everything.
I have very rarely paid more than the suggested minimum fee (which is currently 0.0001 BTC, or roughly $0.045).
Seriously, how the hell did you get "banged" for $0.25 transactions?!  How large were the inputs in the tx, and why were they so large?  What wallet(s) were you using?
Tiny payments should rarely, if ever, be larger than 500 bytes, 786 at most.
I'm simply not buying it, man, and the Coinbase fee is irrelevant to this discussion. Purchasing bitcoin is an separate issue.

I never said that he wants to change bitcoin itself.
However, I think you're underestimating the difference between him and other business owners in this space.
While most of the good ones fight for more limited regulations, Allaire has gone out of his way to encourage more and more regulation.
At no point in time has he ever said something similar to "limited and reasonable regulation."  In fact, most of what he says encourages quite the opposite.

I'm not sure A = B in that equation.  I believe the difference between a libertarian and everyone else is that libertarians do take responsibility for their own actions,  and therefore don't expect/want a government to PAY them back for poor personal choices (or bail out the failed businesses).

Please don't assume.  My post stands in its own as a criticism of the proposal.  It is not meant as a declaration of my feelings about regulation in general.
That said, I personally believe most regulation is the f'n devil, but this proposal is especially egregious.

Again, though, that's not how it works.  You can't just arbitrarily pick a cost basis and stick with it forever.  If you get audited, you'd have to provide a full record of every cost basis -- even with fractions as low as one satoshi!

The risk is in the control they have over your personal information and what information they willingly provide to the government and marketing companies -- including any/all of the otherwise private addresses you withdraw your coins to.
They can also cut you off and freeze accounts at their leisure -- similar to PayPal -- and that's exactly what I predict they will start doing soon enough.
Ask merchants who had their funds frozen by PayPal how they feel about those situations...

I'd suggest booting to a live Linux CD of some sort, and then use the browser on that disc to log into Coinbase and create the vault multisig account from that.  Copy the backup keys onto one or more freshly wiped thumb drives, then stick those drives in one or more safe locations.
Lastly, make sure your next of kin know where to look and how to secure your coins if something ever happens to you.

If you have a steady job, and can afford an additional monthly payment taken from your monthly pay, then you can take a loan out against your own 401k -- probably as much as 30% of that $22k -- with no tax penalties at all!
The best part is that you're basically loaning yourself the money, so all of the payments go back into your own 401k, including the interest! 
I did exactly that last year with a much higher amount.  I used half of the loan to pay off a debt, and then put the other half straight into bitcoin... :)

The point is that those "dramatic bursts" you speak of are becoming less and less severe each and every time.
Dramatically increased levels of support with each retracement?  Check.
Smaller percentage drop in value with each retracement?  Check.
Higher highs on each new dramatic rise (bubbles)?  Check.
Higher lows for each retracement following those bubbles?  Check.
Undeniable four year up-trend?  Check.
Exponentially increasing user base?  Check.

The only problem I have with a system like onename.io is that it's a total pain in the ass to change your bitcoin address on a regular basis.
Since we all know it's best practice to change your receiving address with every transaction, this won't exactly work out very well.

@_date: 2014-02-28 06:20:46
what "trading profits"?  The current customers could make a billion trades in this self-contained box; but, without fresh coins and fiat, all of the supposed "profits from fees" would be just as fake as the fiat and coins they're trading with in the first place!
This simply won't work without adding new REAL coins and new fiat to the mix.  I don't think anyone would transfer either of those things to the exchange if they know ahead of time that it will be given out to everyone else instead of being held for their own accounts.
The fees collected from trades of fake coins and fake fiat would somehow get converted to real BTC and real fiat?  How?

Given the regulations, I don't think that fully compliant companies like Coinbase, Circle, etc, will ever be able to provide users with full control of their own keys.
It will be up to others, and hopefully decentralized exchanges, as well, to provide those capabilities.
I also think you're wrong that this won't affect you directly.  These regulations will have repercussions across the globe (at least for now), as every legit hosted wallet and exchange service will need to identify and deny service to residents of New York if said services are not NYDFS compliant.  Therefore, even simple hosted wallets like Changetip will need AML/KYC mechanisms to facilitate that discovery prices.
You'll also need to request that people don't use NY-compliant services to send you coins; because, in order to remain compliant, those services will require full names and home addresses for recipients of transactions, as well.  That means if someone uses one of those NY-compliant services to send you coins, they're going to need to tell that service all of *your* info.
Unfortunately, we're all going to be affected by this bullshit...
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:15:12
That's absurd given the fact that the bitcoin user base is quite obviously expanding, not shrinking.  The number of transactions each day has continued to increase, as well, and the number of Bitcoin-related businesses is growing every day.
The current investor support above $600 -- a price that is more than 500% higher than it was last summer -- is also a very strong indicator that you're wrong.
The success or failure of Bitcoin will have very little to do with the original or early adopters.  We're way past the point where they are exceptionally relevant to what happens tomorrow.
If I had 10k coins, or more, I could privately sell them tomorrow without moving the average price of Bitcoin by a single dollar.  If I had $5 Million, I could buy just a many with the same result.
The keys to success are 1) security and insurance solutions, 2) widespread adoption, and 3) ease of use.
Your doom and gloom theories and predictions are simply bullshit.

If they establish a mechanism to identify trusted nodes, how would outside nodes a) compromise the internal network of trusted nodes, and b) obtain more than 50% of the hashing power following said compromise?  You don't think that a central monitoring body would notice the instant addition of hundreds or thousands of new nodes (new banks) in their network?
PoS and other interesting proofs stand a very good chance of working well in a completely closed infrastructures.
You cannot view these potential bank implementations of a blockchain through the lens of current decentralized crypto coin implementations.  Their entire purpose and structure would be vastly different than what we're using for bitcoin and all current alts that are derivatives of bitcoin.  Their systems would likely resemble Ripple moreso than bitcoin, litecoin, etc.

I don't think you understand what "intrinsic value" actually means.
Simply put, the inherent or intrinsic value = the functionality/utility sans monetary value.
Are you really so dense that you can't (or won't) admit to the functionality/utility of crypto currencies beyond their monetary value?
Here's a few for you to ponder:  Even if the value of a bitcoin is zero, it can still exist as a proof of ownership.  Even if the value of a namecoin is zero, it can still exist as a proof of identity AND ownership.
There are countless other intrinsic uses for crypto currencies -- both known and undiscovered.

That's patently false.  What the majority of users, full nodes, and processors refer to as "Bitcoin" will retain the value, not what the miners attempt to dictate.  If/when that majority switches, the miners will have to choose between mining actual bitcoin or their own otherwise worthless alt.
Users, full nodes, and payment processors actually do have more power than miners when it comes to selecting a version.

Why would you describe a new set of laws governing crypto as being different from my vague description of a new hybrid asset category?  Wouldn't the outcome be the same regardless of the adjectives we use to describe it?
The focus on semantics doesn't make sense to me.
That said, regarding taxes, I think it may be as simple as treating it as property when exchanged for fiat, and treating it as a foreign currency (with a much higher gains threshold than the normal $200 applied to foreign currencies) when using it to purchase goods and services.
Then, they could simply use standard revenue taxes if/when merchants instantly convert it to fiat.
Rinse and repeat.
One of the aspects that not many people are discussing is the fact that limiting its use with retailers and the service industries, by imposing draconian accounting and tax requirements on consumers, is a short-sighted thing to do in a time when retailers could really use the increased revenue.
Why openly discourage consumer spending and the circulation of those funds in the economy?  The IRS would probably get a bigger piece of the pie if they skipped the capital gains taxes on normal purchases and instead relied on increased merchant revenue taxes that would result from increased consumer spending.
They're not really thinking this through...

Weapons, food, and transport cost money.  Without enough of said money, none of the above would be available for war.

Actually, I think companies like Coinbase are screwed based on some additional API guidance also posted today.
Info and additional analysis here:
It sounds like you'll be able to do BTC transfers (for retail purposes), but they won't allow you to buy and sell bitcoin (or any other currency) itself.
So, normal wallets like mycelium, blockchain.info, and others will be OK; but, bitcoin brokers like Coinbase and Circle may be fucked.

Their argument is that storing the actual data in the blockchain would be more secure and efficient, and it would eliminate the need to convince the majority of miners to merge-mine yet another new alt (as they currently do with namecoin).

One other that I can think of involves taxing gains of more than $200 when even a currency is used to make a purchase.  With normal foreign currencies, those kinds of gains are very rare.  However, with btc, we could be right back to where we started when dealing with it as a property.
At the very least, that threshold would need to be raised dramatically.

1. We already accuse the Foundation of that, so why do you care if/when it happens again? You'd rather see the community label you a collection of scumbags than see some redditters get up in arms about possible favoritism? O.o
2. Hire a third-party due diligence service to background the member (or member company) once an accusation is made and seconded by any other members.
3. Once the due diligence report is in hand, read it, then have a simple majority vote by the Board.  That would suffice in almost every situation. Appeals? It's not the justice system, it's a private company; and, these are not employees, they're members. There's no damn need for an appeals process.  Find a due diligence firm you trust, and stick with them.
You are seriously over-complicating this process by ignoring the simple solution I just listed.  
Company Boards exist for situations exactly like this. Use yours properly.  
You're sitting here worrying about a future potential perception of wrong-doing; but, I don't think you realize that the community would much rather see you finally start getting rid of the shit-stains found all over your membership roster.

So yes, it's pretty profound for Wells Fargo to do this without requiring him to cash it in first.

Your biggest challenges (and highest costs) will be in obtaining, transporting, and securing large amounts of local fiat currency.
In fact, those variables are the excuse that Western Union uses for their exorbitant fees.
How do you plan to handle each of those?  Obtaining it may be easy, but transport and security are extremely costly (and dangerous) endeavors throughout the developing world.
Oh, by the way, I want to help!

Much discussion has been had regarding the suspected Gox sell bot belonging to "Tibanne Hong Kong" or "THK" in the leaked Gox data. However, nobody has found the GUID for the buying side of the Gox bot activity -- the buying bot is often referred to by the name I picked (with the help of some friends during a late night Google Hangout): the one and only "Willy"  (full name: "Willy Buy Buy"...lol)
At approximately 0102 EST on 7 January 2014, the Gox trading API went offline for everyone in the world... EXCEPT Willy, the infamous buy bot suspected of belonging to Mount Gox itself.
During the next ~90 minutes, Willy continued to buy his usual 10-19 BTC every 6-20 minutes while nobody else in the world could trade.  I captured several screenshots of the activity at the time.
Using the attached screenshot with timestamps, can someone please try to find these trades in the leaked data?
(timestamps are listed in EST)  
01:09:03 11.2174 BTC bought at 1030 USD  
01:16:32 18.9182 BTC bought at 1030 USD  
01:23:19 17.4971 BTC bought at 1030 USD  
01:37:54 15.9373 BTC bought at 1035 USD  
01:55:51 15.1799 BTC bought at 1040.99 USD
Those are the easiest Willy buys to find in all of the released data.  If you're able to find the matching GUID, then we'll finally know something about Willy.  Using that GUID, we could analyze Willy's entire trade history since April 2011.
Please and thank you!
Exhibit B (another screenshot taken later that hour):  
EDIT: more discussion on Willy, and more screenshots, can be found here:

tl;dr - Jeremy Allaire spends two years calling for more regulations and courting the regulators, only to realize in the eleventh hour that they don't have his (or our) best interests at heart, and they never will.
The only reasonable response is to cut off New York from the bitcoin ecosystem.  It's only when New York residents and businesses themselves rise up to object, loudly, that there's any chance at all to effect change in their governance.
States like North Carolina, Texas, and California should listen and learn.  Each of those stands a very good chance of taking over as the finance capital of the U.S. if they do *the exact opposite* of New York.

Actually, there's nothing stopping any of them from using their own tokens or credits on the front end, while making every actual transfer using bitcoin on the back end.

Sort of. However, if all three nodes are not aware that they're holding the same data, and they can't challenge one another, my question still stands:  how do you prevent 10 different Nodes from pointing to 1 shared hard drive? (Thus gaming the system)

1) someone running Driveminer gets paid 10 times (or X times) for a single hard drive, and  
2) potential for a single hard drive to hold 2 or more copies of the same data.

There are honestly so many horrible aspects that choosing the worst of those is almost impossible.  The entire thing needs to be scrapped and rewritten, discarded completely, or just flat-out ignored.
1) mandatory certified compliance officer on every team.  
2) can't develop and release an alt coin without a license.  
3) very expensive bonds and capital reserve requirements regardless of the size of your company, and each are determined on a case by case basis by the NYDFS itself.  
4) fingerprinting all staff at every company and submitting those to NYDFS.  
5) having to report all suspicious activity and transactions over $10k to both FinCEN *and* NYDFS. (Current banks don't even have this dual-reporting requirement for their activities)  
6) keeping logs of all activity for ten years, and requiring full personal information for BOTH sides of every transaction (which is impossible with Bitcoin)  
7) having to submit all planned hardware and software upgrades to NYDFS for approval prior to release or integration.  
8) all language is vague, so nobody knows exactly who the entire proposal applies to.  
9) companies *anywhere in the world* that are not fully compliant with the BitLicense are expected to identify all New York customers and block them.  Failure to do so may result in international prosecution.  
10) NYDFS has the right to audit any company at any time, and they intend to fine and/or prosecute those who are not in compliance.  
11) Companies are not permitted to retain any profits in bitcoin, and must instead invest those profits in USD or "approved" USD-based derivatives.  
12) Existing banks and other licensed financial services are exempt from all of the above even if they integrate Bitcoin into their services or infrastructure.  
Etc etc.  
Like I said, it's almost impossible to pick just one of those and label it the worst.  The entire proposal is a pile of garbage!  
If you care about the future of Bitcoin, do yourself a favor and read the entire proposal.  Afterwards, collect your thoughts and submit mature feedback to NYDFS directly.

Not an issue, eh? 
How do I determine the original value of every one of my current BTC's from 2013-2014?  They've been around the world on dozens of exchanges, and back again to Coinbase and cold storage. I obtained them using different methods, on a hundred different days, and therefore a hundred different values.  (reddit tips, mining alt coins, trading on exchanges, cash on localbitcoins, bank deposits at Coinbase, trades for good on craigslist, etc).
I also made 50+ small purchases, both in person and online, using my coins during 2013.
There's simply no place to even start to retroactively figure out what my CGT obligations might be for those 50+ purchases.  what will it be like to do the same with 100+ purchases this year?  How about 1000+ purchases next year?
Seriously, good luck with that...

In this case, calling it "useless for transactions" was patently false, as both Coinbase and Bitpay have proven.
He also failed to acknowledge that volatility has decreased, and will continue to decrease, as both adoption and market cap increase.
Not to mention all of the functionality and utility beyond simple retail transactions that he also completely failed to acknowledge.
In other words, like I said above, he was either bring intentionally misleading, or he simply doesn't understand all aspects of bitcoin itself.

The two are not necessarily equitable. I have a million reasons to chat or trade files with people and systems around the world, but I've only wired money internationally three times in my entire life (I'm 40).
International remittance is worthless for my family and I, and we're the "average U.S. consumers" I was referring to.

What we need is more companies that actually WANT/NEED to hold the bitcoin for their payroll and suppliers.  Until that happens, none of the companies "accepting bitcoin" are going to argue this point for us.
Then again, I do still think they'll be able to hold coins, regardless of this regulation, if they can prove that their bitcoin holdings are for those operational purposes (therefore not considered an "investment").
If anything, I think they should simply add a caveat to the regs that clarifies that bitcoin CAN be held as operational capital, rather than as an investment.

The New York DFS regulations for BitLicenses will be announced in Q2 (sometime on/before June 30 this year).
There are at least two major U.S. bitcoin exchanges opening after those regulations are announced that will cater to major Wall Street traders, and at least one other that will allow all/most other Americans to invest in bitcoin-based derivatives, trusts, and funds. (ie. shift X percentage of your IRAs to a bitcoin ETF)
All of that is supposed to occur between June 30th and December 31st of this year.
Kraken may complete their registration in all 50 states by then, as well.  If they do, then they'll also probably sign on with a NY-based bank that will agree to facilitate USD deposits and withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-07-23 21:21:02
While the answer to that is obviously no, that doesn't mean they're not going to try.

Once you have a sizeable amount of money invested in your 401k, you can do what I did:  take out a loan directly from your own 401k.
You'll only be able to do so for a percentage of the total invested (which, in my case, was 30%).
The beauty of this method is that the future payments you make on the loan are deducted directly from your own paycheck alongside your normal 401k contribution, AND they all go directly back into your own 401k.  You will also pay a little bit of interest on the loan, but all of that interest goes back into your own 401k, as well! (You're essentially just giving yourself a loan).
In other words, there is no penalty at all for "withdrawing" from your 401k using this method.  In fact, once I found out that this was possible, it became a no-brainer for me.  I used half of the loan to pay off all of my other debts, and the rest went straight into bitcoin! :)
I just needed to be willing to live off of 5% less from each paycheck for three years.  But, since that 5% is going straight back into my 401k, there's really no worries at all!
If you change jobs, you can transfer the deduction for the loan to the new payroll system, so that's not a concern either.

It's impossible for bitcoin itself to ever resemble the dollar in every way, so your cute little story is just plain stupid.
It's obvious that new and creative consumer protection mechanisms are necessary, but I have no doubt at all that they'll surface soon enough.
Hell, we already have some insured storage options popping up, so it's only a matter of time before larger ones take their place (higher coverage, better security, etc).
In fact, traditional banks could easily convert to bitcoin storage entities if they ever wake up and realize that opportunity is there for the taking, and even the FDIC itself could get involved if the ecosystem matures to the point that it's viable...

Could the first be solved by simply hashing something unique to every hard drive to ensure that no two nodes are pointing to the same one?  I'm not familiar enough with hard drive technologies, but is there anything unique about each one that would suit this purpose?  A hard coded serial number, perhaps?  I guess that could probably be spoofed, though... hmm.  Interesting dilemma!

Their $300 Million investment to destroy bitcoin would prove pointless when we all switch over to a new coin based on a different algorithm the very same day, and all of their attack hardware instantly becomes obsolete.
Not to mention the difficulty in obtaining that much ASIC hardware in the first place without anyone noticing.

@_date: 2014-08-08 15:32:34
Exactly!  It's going to be fun! ;)
The interesting part will be seeing which market leads and which one follows.  My gut feeling is that it will be the open markets leading most of the time because they're open 24 hours a day, while the ETF will likely be limited to NASDAQ trading times. 
Does anyone know the after hours trading rules for ETFs on NASDAQ?

That 8% is identical to their tax on purchases using cash or credit card, so it's not as though bitcoin purchases will be more expensive to their cash and CC purchases.  
Bitcoin still maintains an advantage versus CC purchases because the merchants themselves won't have to pay the CC processing fees.  As a result, they may still pass that savings on to consumers in the form of a 1-5% savings.
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:08:34
You are absolutely correct on all counts.  If the regs were to pass, as is, the impact will be felt across the globe in the crypto industry -- by all companies and users alike.
We absolutely HAVE to make these points, and others, very clear to Lawsky and his team.  They need to realize the negative impact their current version would have on the entire future of this industry.

I agree that we should shift the entire system to one that is based on consumption, rather than income or gains, but it will be (and has been) extremely tough to get all of the states and the IRS to play along with that idea.

yeah, I've been looking into the Bitcoin ATM business myself, and the per-state requirements are absolutely ridiculous and pretty much a deal-breaker at this point (for me).

You know as well I do that it is unique.  For the first time in history, something has the ability to act as both a store of wealth (commodity) AND a frictionless payment system (currency).
There is no old IRS mold that fits both of those inherent functions simultaneously, so bitcoin will require a new hybrid asset category in order to succeed at both inherent functions.  Period.

Unlike the CEO of Coinbase and every other bitcoin-related company in the U.S., Jeremy Allaire is consistently calling for MORE regulation, not just limited or reasonable regulations for clarity.

Amex themselves reported that chargeback fraud accounted for as much as $2 Billion last year, and the list of small businesses that have gone under across the globe as a result is practically endless.
That said, even many very large retail businesses operate on 3-4% margins, so saving on CC fees can often mean millions in additional revenue.
Good luck on your "retail business with both a physical store and warehouse and 3 websites"...

Whatever the case, great summary!

Buying bitcoin with your credit card did not solve that problem for you.  In fact, using your credit card with Circle.com probably gave them just as much information about you, or more, as you would if you linked your bank account directly.
The only (easy) semi-anonymous way to buy bitcoin is using cash through face-to-face trades.  I say "semi-anonymous" because the seller you meet in person will know your face and whatever name you give him/her when you communicate.
Using Circle will expose your true identity just as much as Coinbase or any other legal online exchange.

A $300 bitcoin is useless for b2b, which is where the real utility will eventually shine.  
If I need/want to pay a widget supplier in Asia $10 Million for the next 6 months of my widget supply, I would need more than 30,000 btc right now, which is unrealistic.  However, if btc are $10k each, I could do it with just 1000 btc... etc etc, scale accordingly.
Businesses send billions per day for b2b purposes. If they ever want to take advantage of the efficiency and cost savings of Bitcoin transfers, the price will have to rise accordingly.
Therefore, I believe b2b will eventually become Bitcoin's killer app...

It's not the Federal AML/KYC regulations that are the big expense, it's the state-by-state Money Services Business (MSB) licensing that imposes the draconian requirements and exorbitant expenses.

It's actually much shorter than that in many places for regular banks, safety deposit boxes, etc.
To be fair, they don't just take it and sell it.  They take possession and then attempt to contact the owners, next of kin, etc, for another few years before they *then* sell it or liquidate.
I had this happen a few years ago with a college bank account I had completely forgotten.  My state notified me, I filled out a form, and they then sent me a check for the small balance I had left behind.

My comments and assessment are based on remarks he frequently made AFTER founding Circle and then somehow positioning himself to be the keynote speaker at numerous bitcoin events.  These events and remarks were all in late 2013 and early 2014.
I know *why* he was touting the company line with regulators, but that doesn't change the fact that he was, indeed, kissing their regulatory asses for the last two years.
This response is the first time I've seen him actually recognize that regulators don't have his (or our) best interests at heart.  For that reason, it's also the first time that I've gained a little bit of respect for Jeremy...

Don't feel bad.  They also told the NY Labor Board that there is no need to provide them with the normally mandatory impact analysis since, based on the analysis they also failed to send you, they've already determined that there would be little or no impact on NY small businesses and entrepreneurs.
They're making a habit of discarding any/all requests for analysis -- even those requested and required by other NY regulatory bodies!

The ETF will trade independently from the open markets (Bitstamp, BTC-e, OKcoin, etc), and every ETF share = 0.2 BTC.
We don't yet know which market will lead, or which will follow.  Since open markets trade 24/7, my personal gut feeling is that the ETF will more often than not follow the open markets, but that could certainly change depending on time of day.
It will be very interesting to see how each affects the other...

In my above example (not the OP!), I changed the initial bitcoin purchase price to $560 (not $30).
I did so in order to prove YOU'RE ACTUALLY CORRECT to the other poster.  I even used the more severe short-term rate (in this case, 25%) to prove that point.

But that's not good enough at this early stage when huge mistakes or crazy events in one exchange have such a dramatic impact on the entire ecosystem.  
Once liquidity and market cap are more mature, the ecosystem will probably be able to withstand such events.  But, as it stands, it's quite dangerous to support or encourage such instability in the market (such vulnerabilities).
And then, what about proof of reserves?  Proof of solvency?  Who is held accountable if/when they go offline?

See my edits to my last post.  Willy's daily purchases didn't even keep up with the number of bitcoin being mined every day, let alone the number of coins being traded.  There were trading walls every $25 that were larger than Willy's total daily volume, and Willy's purchases were far too small and spread out to effect the direction of the trading itself.
Because math.
And no active trader during that time would agree with you that Gox led the rally.  China took the lead almost every single day. The brief moments throughout November when Gox might have led were always quickly swallowed up by the Chinese exchanges taking control of the movements in either direction.

The automated resends began piling up quickly, and Mark himself had to manually resend my first one one evening.  (Which I think he did just to shut me up on IRC... lol)

So you're claiming that we DON'T have a CGT obligation on transactions when bitcoin is used as a currency to buy goods or services?
That's not how I understand the guidelines released yesterday.  It's my understanding that if I use a bitcoin that I bought for $30 a year ago to directly purchase a laptop from Tigerdirect for $585 today, I'm obligated to pay CGT (short term?  Long term?) on the $555 difference.
That obligation is NOT true for purchases made using fiat cash I earned one year ago, nor it's it true if I use PayPal or credit cards.
Purchasing goods or services with bitcoin does not require switching it to fiat before or during the purchase, so taxing it as if I did so is wrong.
I understand that this is how they've treated purchases using precious metals in the past, but bitcoin is NOT a previous metal, so it shouldn't be treated as such.
This CGT obligation at the point of sale is simply unacceptable and near impossible to abide by.  It's overly burdensome on both the consumers and the businesses who wish to use bitcoin as a day-to-day currency.
I've done everything in bitcoin using legitimate means and my real name, yet I wouldn't even begin to know how or where to start in calculating CGT obligations for the 50+ small purchases I made with bitcoin over the last year... Seriously, there's no chance in hell to figure that out.

I thought of the two wallet solution a few minutes ago myself; but, again, it becomes an accounting nightmare for the average consumer if they then choose to do anything outside of Coinbase with their coins. 
People will simply stick with CC and PayPal where none of that matters.
It would also be painful to have to file CGT when you never actually traded anything.  
I'd bet that ~95% of the population has never filed CGT in their lives, and they're not going to want to start now for what is otherwise supposed to be just a payment system for them.
It's ridiculously burdensome, which is the polar opposite of what Satoshi envisioned for this system.

About the only thing we can do to track their position is match up their lobbying activities with the votes of those they meet with on the Hill.  For example, if they meet with a congress critter who later announces a bill that would increase taxes on bitcoin, then you can probably tie that bill back to the MasterCard lobbyists.

Of course we can (and do) use alternatives in other countries. However, I think Bruce's point is that a vast number of us would much prefer to use one on US soil, but excessive regulations and cost-prohibitive license requirements have prevented that from being an option.
There is currently no viable Gox alternative on US soil.  Not one.  None.
And, that is entirely due to the excessive regulations and license requirements imposed upon US businesses.

I'm a trader, and I disagree.  There's much more money to be made off trading bitcoin over the long-term than there is in tanking it with one big coordinated short.
My guess is that they'll do so on a much smaller scale over and over again -- which, coincidentally, is exactly what we've been witnessing on Gox for the last week.
There are also A LOT of people preparing to open a 10:1 long tomorrow if Gox reopens withdrawals... many traders will have their fingers hovering over their mouse buttons to take advantage of the subsequent rise at Gox.

Re-read my edited post above.  I clearly demonstrated that revealing a name can, in fact, be the basis for blackmail -- therefore negating your example.
A similar example would be threatening to mail compromising photographs to an employer or spouse.  Simply mailing pictures isn't a crime, but the induced fear of repercussions (or consequences) absolutely qualifies the threat as a basis for blackmail (or extortion).
The resulting fear, by itself, is enough to get a conviction for extortion.

Wrong.  The reason they've written their affidavit in this fashion is because the courts still require admitted evidence to be collected in accordance with "old" laws.

Now that I've debunked your points that Gox led the rally and that Willy made large purchases, is it your contention that his existence and slow accumulation simply squeezed supply so much so that it drove the entire market up +$1000?
That's just... ridiculous.
Edit: using a mean purchase amount and time of 15 bitcoin every 7.5 minutes, Willy only bought an average of 2880 bitcoin per day.  That doesn't even keep up with the number of coins being mined every day (~3600), let alone placed in the order books.

If the satellites are networked to one another, and each maintains their own power source and a full copy of the blockchain, terrestrial outages would have zero effect on the satellites' abilities to continue operating.
Areas without cellular or internet coverage could actually conduct bitcoin transactions with smart satellite phones.
Which part of that confuses you?  You need to realize that billions of people don't have easy access to the internet for comms, so anything that provides them with even limited access is a step up from where they are today.

Not really.  Robocoin receives a flat 30% of all machine revenue during the first year of operation, which adds up quickly.  I also believe their "cut" of  machine revenue actually increases after the first year, as well.  An ambassador would receive 25% of that until they hit the $10k.
My guess would be less than two months of wait time in most metro locations.

That's the point, they don't make real arguments.  They always fall back on the *"you just don't understand."*  When you press them for specific counters to things like *"the power and features of the bitcoin network (or protocol) itself provide intrinsic value,"* their response remains simplified with statements like *"that's not intrinsic value, I can't touch it,"* with no further explanation.  When I counter with *"in that case, what intrinsic value does a dollar bill have,"* I sometimes get the *"you can burn them for heat."*  I mean, seriously?! O.o
That's just one example, but there are countless others.
I've taken to adding *"...as I was taught"* to the end of everything my friend says.  It makes it much easier to tolerate his evasiveness and obtuse responses that way.
I guess this is to be expected with such dramatic paradigm shifts.  For some people, they just can't step outside the box they've been living in for so long.  When you ask them simple things like *"what is money, really,"* their answers are always black and white textbook stuff with no room for evolution or change of any sort, and it almost always comes down to *"issued and backed by a central authority."*  (which, ultimately, is the basis for their entire view of the world).
While it's often frustrating, I guess it's also to be expected to a certain extent.  This (old paradigm) stuff was drilled into them for so long...
@_date: 2014-06-28 05:06:45
For which step?
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:01:39
1. Many other business owners in the bitcoin arena go out of their way to fight for limiting regulation.  Those are the calibre of companies and businessmen I will support.
2.  I disagree with your last sentence.  The goal of Allaire, and those like him, is to control EVERY transaction of Bitcoin in the U.S.  If he and his cronies could find a regulatory way to prevent you from moving your coins where/when you want to, they would do so in a minute!  Don't be surprised when he starts openly encouraging coin blacklists, as well... "for the good of the people."

1) Consumers don't pay fees to use bitcoin with merchants.  I have never paid a fee to buy something, or pay someone, with bitcoin.  If you have, then you're doing it wrong.  In fact, I've more often than not received a nice DISCOUNT when using bitcoin to make a purchase!
2) I didn't pay any fees when acquiring most of my personal bitcoin, and the price at Circle is usually very close to the Winkdex or Bitcoin Average... sometimes even less.  There are no fees for consumers if they use Circle to convert to bitcoin and use it to make purchases.
3) some of us prefer an economy that isn't based on debt.  Everyone living within their means would certainly be a refreshing change -- especially at the retail and general consumption levels. 
That doesn't mean that extraordinary expenditures, such as real estate and business, can't still involve loans using Bitcoin.  What it means is that both the interest rates and risk for the borrowers and lenders, respectively, will be kept in check -- even to the point that p2p lending might become more common.
Unless you're a fan of housing bubbles and other economic catastrophes brought on by irresponsible lending?  If that's the case, then you're part of the problem, not the solution...

Not true.
Answer one simple question:  what's the likelihood that the losing buyers still want bitcoin after the auction?
It's my contention that they will still need thousands of coins as the basis for their new funds and bitcoin businesses, so they're likely to seek them out through other means.
Can you argue with that likelihood without simply doing what I'm doing -- that is, putting forth a theory?

Oh, so a savings account that earns interest is different from an IRA?
Both account types require deposits.  You can't just make up a distinction where none exists.  A deposit is a deposit is a deposit.  
The type of account should be irrelevant to the point that regulations didn't prevent people from losing half of their life savings.
In other words, regulations don't prevent catastrophic loss from corporate/government incompetence and corruption.

Nullc is correct.  The vast majority of the stuck TX in late January were due to "Outputs Already Spent," thus they never appeared in the blockchain at all.  The only ones that ended up going through with a different TXID were those that Gox resent manually.
I had two such withdrawals in late January.  One of which was resent manually by Mark after a brief chat with him directly on IRC.  The second was supposedly handled by neotufur (sp?), but might also have required a manual push by Mark.

To be fair, bonds don't work like that.  The total bond amounts will have a minimum (probably in the neighborhood of $1 Million) and scale up from there.
The key is that you don't pay that amount.  Instead, you make payments like any other insurance -- which would total roughly $75k to $250k per year, depending on the size of the bond requirement.
That said, it's obviously still cost prohibitive for most startups, so I think it's absurd.  
You would also be required to hold X amount of cash in reserves, where X is dictated on a case by case basis by Herr Lawsky himself.  That capital requirement may be the real killer for startups... :(
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:22:39
To your first point:  wrong.  The $600 figure does not apply when you're attempting to calculate the cost basis for those thousands of small fractions of coins. (which is required for all future calculations of gains when you trade or attempt to spend those specific coins on merchandise)
Regarding your second point:  no software product can or will be able ever calculate the cost basis for every small fraction of coin in piles like my own.  It's actually physically and logically impossible to do so at this point since much of the data for those cost bases no longer exists.
I'm not an ancap, and I've always had every intention of being compliant with whatever rules are imposed.  In fact, I've used my real name on every wallet service, mining pool, and exchange I've ever utilized for bitcoin.  
Regardless, here I sit with a pile of coins that is impossible to determine the thousands of individual cost bases for, so I'll now and forever be non-compliant through no fault of my own.
F'n swell.

They're perfectly positioned to track and provide that information for the merchants, just as other consumer wallet services are perfectly positioned to do the same for the rest of us.
If the merchants receive the coins through Bitpay, and then hold the coins in a Bitpay wallet, wouldn't it make sense for Bitpay to help them use that coin to pay their employees and suppliers, as well?
The dream is to "close the loop" so that bitcoin remains the payment method throughout the entire system, so why wouldn't Bitpay want to facilitate that?  It's in their best interests to do so.

Again, that does nothing for you when you accumulate coins using a hundred different types of sources, hundreds or thousands of individual transactions both on and off the blockchain, and over the course of months or years.
It's extremely easy to look up the price on your preferred exchange for any moment in time, but it's nearly impossible to backtrack the exact time and origin of every tiny fraction of coin some of us have accumulated over the last few years.
Many of those sources don't even exist anymore (mining pools, faucets, etc).
Seriously, no software could solve that problem.  It would need to be done manually using records that sometimes don't even exist anymore, which makes it a total non-starter...
@_date: 2014-08-02 19:16:40

That specific issue is easily fixed the moment everyone uses normalized receiving addresses of some sort.

I asked you some questions you didn't answer.  Your link doesn't provide me with *your* answer to my questions, so I have no idea what point you're making, our what metric you're using.
What metric are you using to determine, without any doubt, that the value is so obviously outpacing adoption and utility? 
My position:  The truth is that there has never been, in the history of the world, something like bitcoin.  It's a new *thing*.  It's a new genre of currency/commodity/utility.  It's unique. Therefore, we really have nothing, at all, to measure it against -- in terms of value vs. utility and adoption
Basic technical analysis of the 4-year market chart is my rebuttal.  The continuous uptrend, the ever-increasing levels of investor support, the annual increases in market cap, the higher highs, and the higher lows... all of which are simply undeniable.  These are all real metrics that any first-year finance student could interpret the same as I have.

There was a guy at Cryptolina this weekend who is building a new security services company called Procryptic Incorporated, but I don't really know the details.  There is also a web app security testing service named CrowdCurity that has a unique crowd-sourced approach to testing web apps.
I'm not aware of many others, but I do think we'll see that space grow rather quickly as this industry matures.  We could certainly use the help of such pros to make all of our other new companies and apps more secure!

No, it will actually hurt consumers due to the ways in which foreign currency holdings are taxed.  That is, you have to pay income taxes on the UNREALIZED gains for your foreign currency holdings at the end of every calendar year.  (Meaning you're taxed on the coins you haven't even used or sold yet)
By treating them as property, the personal accounting burden is the issue.
By treating them as currencies, the higher tax burden becomes the issue.
That is why neither of those asset categories is the ideal fit for the unique nature of crypto currencies.
We need a new hybrid category for this to really work.

Here's the likely scenario:
Gox received threats by mail, phone, forums, etc, so they switched their mailing address to the "virtual office" address for security reasons.
IF they actually moved operations, they didn't move to the tower.  Instead, they likely moved (or are moving) to a completely undisclosed location.
The alternative scenario, of course, is that they may be preparing for bankruptcy and the liquidation of assets. (Which I still doubt, btw)

The problem is that their laws negatively impact ALL exchanges and wallet services throughout the world, not just the ones in NY.  Every exchange and hosted wallet service that isn't in compliance with NY regs will need to a) identify NY residents, and b) deny them service.
That's insane and detrimental to all of us, and it's only going to get worse as more and more states copy NY's regulations in this matter.

Actually, it won't be "relegated back to dark markets."  Instead, two distinct markets for Bitcoin will co-exist.
The regulations in New York amount to a catch-22.  On one hand, it will make it much more difficult to innovate and use bitcoin privately.  On the other, since big traders in New York don't ultimately care about their privacy, it will allow them to trade it using VERY large piles of money in the fully regulated exchanges that will pop up in New York.
So, ironically, the regs will likely take Bitcoin to the moon; however, that ride will come at the (tremendous) expense of our privacy and freedom to use it, and innovate on top of it, as was originally intended.
Sad, but true... :(

Sadly, you have not misunderstood.  All online bitcoin exchanges and hosted wallets, everywhere in the world, will need to implement something to either a) become fully NYDFS compliant, or b) identify and deny access to NY State residents -- or they'll all risk legal prosecution by the State of New York.
This is very similar to what we saw with offshore online gambling sites that are/were forced to identify and deny U.S. residents.

Actually, as pointed out below, you only paid $30 for the original bitcoin, so the actual total cost for the laptop would only be $30 + $124.20 (taxes) = ~$154.20.  
That's the huge benefit of a deflationary currency!
Let's try this with a smaller price difference to keep it more realistic:
1. BTC $560 -&gt; $585 = $25 price difference.
2. In 2014, gains on assets owned for less than one year plus one day are taxed at your ordinary income tax rates. 
3. Median short-term CGT rate = 25%
4. 0.25 x $25.00 = $6.25
5. Sales tax (7%) = $40.95
Total with BTC = $560 + $6.25 + $40.95 = $607.20  
Normal Cost using cash or CC = $585 + $40.95 = $625.95
**As you can see, it's really not the added cost I was worried about.... it's the added burden of figuring out all of the above for everything you ever buy with bitcoin!**

It's just a catchy way of describing a future system wherein nearly everything is connected, by way of a network, to nearly everything else.
Feel free to call that concept whatever you want to call it; but, IMO, "Internet of Things" is a pretty straightforward catch phrase for referring to such a system.  Eventually, though, it will likely revert to simply being called "the Internet" once all "things" have been connected to it, and it becomes strange to think of them as separate in any way. (IOW, once the marketing for such connectivity has run its course, and the inter-collection of non-standard devices becomes "the norm.")
Also, IMO, "The Cloud" is a much more ridiculous or nebulous term to describe remote storage and application hosting...

The initial demand is not hypothetical -- it's the sum total of each bidder times the number of coins they each desire.
Example with fake numbers:  5 bidders each want all 30k coins.  That's demand for 150k coins.  Since only one bidder can win the coins, only 30k coins are subtracted from that total demand at the end of the auction.  Thus, what I was referring to as residual demand would be 120k coins.
Now, the current auction will have much different numbers, of course, but this should be a clear enough example for even a monkey like you to get my f'n point... maybe... or not.

... and a lot of users with ridiculously low bids happily received some incredibly cheap coins! 
Some traders, like me, love putting in ridiculously low bids when we "go to sleep in fiat."  Why?  Because there's always the chance some whale will come along and dump wayyyyyy below the market price just to cash out quickly. 
From that perspective, the crazy dump on BTCe this week was f'n beautiful! :)
This actually happens quite often on the exchanges, but this one may have been the biggest I've seen yet.  
Quite a few traders on BTCe had the best day of their trading life this week!

I wholeheartedly disagree that there is a difference *in this context.*  All of the above are methods of payment processing -- the only differences being the identity of the third party processors, and denominations of the payer's currency of choice.
It could be said that they don't take dollars, francs, or euros, either, since whatever currency the payer uses to pay the processor could be considered irrelevant.
Saying that they accept Visa, MasterCard, and Bitpay/Coinbase may be the best way to put it, but even that implies that they accept bitcoin as a payment IF you believe they take dollars for payment in the case of the credit cards.
Calling something a "fact" doesn't make it so.

1) this new "bit" term actually refers to uBTC, not mBTC.  
2) in the 21st century, "bits" are not normally a base-10 unit of measure or denomination.  While they were used as a currency denomination 100+ years ago, that's well beyond living human memory at this point.

No, you're absolutely correct -- the only exception being a new and more flexible crypto currency coming along to take bitcoin's place.
Then again, thanks to the size of the network and first-mover advantages, that's not as likely as it once was.  IOW, even if something technically better comes along, Bitcoin may still remain the defacto standard.

I honestly never imagined a nightmare scenario wherein I'd be required to calculate CGT obligations every time I buy lunch.  
That single requirement completely destroys any benefits that using something as efficient as bitcoin would otherwise provide.
This entire thing could be fixed by adding something as simple as "for any purchase of goods or services over $2000" to the guidelines.
Tax dodgers could still avoid that by insisting on multiple small transactions on anything over that amount, but the businesses and merchants probably wouldn't facilitate their shadiness too often.

The difference between Bitcoin and every previous financial service is that Bitcoin gives consumers a choice as to whether or not they use the centralized services.

Actually, I believe it's because "currency" allows for a $200 minimum appreciation before taxes are required, while "property" has no such minimum.
For that reason, if it were labeled a currency, MOST day-to-day use would not require CGT obligations.
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:14:51
Are you a business owner?
Regardless, I was referring to Bitpay possibly helping the merchants track their bitcoin CGT obligations, not actually filing the taxes for them.  If they hold onto the bitcoin and use it for payroll and to pay suppliers, the merchants will definitely need some way to track it -- and Bitpay is in the best position to facilitate that tracking since they're likely holding the merchants' coins from start to finish.

My coins have all been in and out of nearly every exchange on the planet; so, tracking exactly which ones I spent on little things, and when, would be pretty much impossible.

So what value would you choose as the basis for 2.1 btc that was compiled from 1000+ individual alt-mining payouts on 100+ random mining pools over the last two years, most of which no longer exist?  You then took those alt coins and traded them on a dozen different random exchanges in various lump sums, all on random days, and once again many of those exchanges no longer exist or offer records.
At the same time, you purchased or traded for 30+ additional btc using localbitcoins, cash, Mt Gox, Cryptsy, Bter, BTCe, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, and Coinbase -- with hundreds of small gains and losses along the way on all of the above.
You ALSO lost and won hundreds of small fractions of btc on Satoshi dice, and you received coins from more than 30 different faucets for bitcoin and a few dozen other alt coins.
You also have coins from reddit tips.
And maybe 1.1 btc from gadget sales you made on craigslist.
And you already made 50+ misc small purchases at restaurants and stores, both on and offline, during that two years.
You finally combined all of the coins into two wallets, with the exception of 0.432543 btc left on Cryptsy to play with alt coin trading.  Your hot wallet has 2.1 btc, while your cold wallet now has 32.355357 btc.
Now, using your hot wallet, go buy a $613 laptop on Tigerdirect with that btc and tell me your capital gains tax obligation for the purchase.  Oh, don't forget the obligatory form 1099 since the purchase is over $600...

1. Again, as I told you in the other thread:  Coinbase can't track the data for coins I deposit into their wallet -- they can only do so for coins that they sell me and maintain 100% control over from initial purchase to final use.  
And how about those of us who use private storage and wallets on our phones?  How on earth would we personally track all of this data on a daily basis?  Will we all be forced to use paid services -- thus, once again destroying one of the key benefits of bitcoin? 
2. Not all merchants are the size and shape of Tigerdirect, Amazon, or Best Buy.  Do you honestly think they'll be able to afford the additional services?  Once again, this is an unnecessary burden on them, and it WILL prevent many of them from considering bitcoin as a payment method.  Why would they want to add CGT to their already complex tax obligations whenever they pay their employees and suppliers?!   You're saying that it's "all too easy and affordable," but that's simply not true for the vast majority of small businesses throughout the country.

That was my first thought, as well, but here's the problem:  it is logistically impossible for the wallet providers to track all of the required information for coins that they themselves didn't sell you.
Example:  If I transfer my entire pile of coins to Coinbase, **EVEN I** don't know where to begin in calculating all of their initial values or how and when they individually came into my possession.  
How could we expect any wallet provider to do that with coins they didn't sell to us and control the entire time?
We would somehow have to track ALL of that data ourselves to pass along to the wallet providers when we deposit coins, and I just don't see how that could ever happen.... do you?

he wasn't saying anything about being paid in bitcoin, though -- or any other "under the table" arrangement, for that matter.
He simply took 1/6 of his already taxed USD income and bought bitcoin with it.  He then used that bitcoin to make hundreds of small purchases throughout the year.
His question (and mine) is:  how the hell are we supposed to track those hundreds of purchases each year along with the "standard value" of the Bitcoin, and associated gains/losses, at the exact time of those purchases?
It simply won't happen.  
When I buy a lunch with bitcoin, I'm not going to record the exact time of day, the price of BTC at that exact time on my favorite exchange, and then later try to calculate the CGT implications for that lunch purchase. 
That type of requirement is simply too ridiculous.

Well, to be fair, the ETF requests are going through the SEC, and they (the SEC) have claimed before that they consistently have hundreds of similar (non-bitcoin) requests to process.

@_date: 2014-07-14 03:31:08
Well, for starters, nobody has ever attempted a decentralized peer-to-peer market before very recently.  Instead, they've all used the central server (or "Napster-type") solution that can obviously be shut down very easily by law enforcement.
Have you ever seen or used BitTorrent?  If not, it's basically just a peer-to-peer file sharing service wherein every participant runs a node of the system.  The files themselves are then spread across all the nodes, so taking down any one of the nodes has little or no impact on the entire collective.  For this reason, there's simply nothing any authority can do to stop it short of shutting down the entire internet itself.  That is how/why it's called "decentralized," and how/why it's profound.
Until Bitcoin came along, there was no real way to handle the financial and messaging aspects of a decentralized market, so there wasn't much effort put in to create such decentralized markets.
With bitXbay (this thread) and OpenBazaar (still in development), we're finally starting to see true decentralized markets wherein, like BitTorrent, every market participant will run their own node.  The individual "stores," or market listings, will be shared across the entire network of nodes; so, just as it is with BitTorrent, no single node will exist as a single point of failure for the entire decentralized network of nodes.  Law enforcement taking down any single node (seller or buyer) will have no effect on the rest of the decentralized network because all of the other nodes will still be up and running with all of the other listings.
Unlike Silk Road (and other "dark" markets), there is no central controlling entity that's running the market -- in other words, there's no single admin to arrest, and no single server to unplug.
Once these solutions mature a bit, every single darkmarket you read about will absolutely migrate to these systems.  It's only a matter of time before these decentralized markets will become as difficult to stop (read: nearly impossible) as file sharing on BitTorrent.
Make more sense now?
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:30:40

*"Such volatility makes it useless as a means to do transactions."*
Useless, eh?  Steve Forbes has apparently never heard of Bitpay, Coinbase, Overstock.com, Tigerdirect, or the tens of thousands of other merchants (more every day) who are currently processing transactions with customers using bitcoins.
As I said, most economists barely understand the Bitcoin protocol and ecosystem, so their opinions end up sounding ridiculously ignorant -- even the "smartest" amongst them.  They simply haven't done the research necessary to form an actual informed opinion on the subject.
If just one of them would take the time to actually understand what it is their talking about, I'd have more respect for them and hear them out.  Unfortunately, my guess is that most won't ever bother doing so.  Instead, they'll just continue to preach against something they don't even understand...

Willy's small buys did not apply any upward pressure on price during the entire three months of its existence.
If you understood the math involved with Willy's algorithm, and the dynamics of the Gox exchange, you would also understand why what I'm saying is true.
You're absolutely wrong about Willy's impact (or effect) during last year's rally -- or, more accurately, the lack thereof.
Willy was a very slow accumulation bot, nothing more.  His total daily purchases didn't even keep up with the number of coins being mined every day, and said purchases were spaced out throughout those entire days in tiny 10-20 btc increments that barely moved the needle -- even when there were lulls and nobody else was trading.
I discovered Willy and studied him in real time very extensively for more than a month...
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:36:34
No, because they pool all of the coins that are deposited; and then use the coins from that pool to support all other random withdrawals.  
They're essentially tumbling your coins with every other user on their exchange, so tracing them becomes pointless.

Regardless of its status as property, it's taxed as cash **income** (not capital gains) for both merchants and miners when they receive it.
Only the buyer is responsible for **capital gains** at the POS of any good or service.
If the merchant or miner holds the bitcoin, only then are they responsible for capital gains if/when they later cash it in or use it to pay for another good or service.

Simple analysis of what we know from the leaked list of interested parties.  Only one name on the list is a known arbitrage specialist.  Most of the others control investment funds or bitcoin-based businesses of one sort or another.

@_date: 2014-03-26 05:16:51
Most of my BTC has been traded into alts and fiat and back again, a dozen times or more, so any taxes are probably going to be a f'n nightmare.  And, I'm certainly not going to calculate fractional capital gains on any purchases I've made with coins that may or may not have increased in value more than $200 at the time.
Seriously, figuring all that out would be next to impossible. 
If/when I cash out any coins to my bank account, I'll figure out CG then.  Everything else?  After individual random purchases?  No way. Fuck that.

I'm a trader.  It's a known fact amongst traders that the Chinese exchanges led nearly every rally in November and December 2013.

@_date: 2014-04-09 06:19:16
I kept fantastic records of all of my on-blockchain transfers and large trades on the bigger exchanges.  
It's the thousands of little fractions (which eventually added up) accumulated from mining and selling alt coins, social media tips, faucets, Satoshi dice, gifts, etc, that I don't have accurate records for because those events were either too small (seemingly insignificant at the time), or were done off-chain on sites that no longer even exist.
I also used bitcoin to make 50+ random small purchases over the last year (lunch, coffee, t-shirts, etc).  There's simply no chance in hell that I'll bother with trying to retroactively calculate those  events. 
It's the culmination of all of those concurrent events, using dozens of student wallets, that makes my recently combined piles of coins so unmanageable from a capital gains prospective.
If I were to ever attempt to use them as a currency again, trying to calculate an accurate gains obligation would be impossible. 
Therefore, I think I'll just become a hodler to avoid that whole mess until they fix the bullshit guidelines or I die ... which is a real shame because I really target enjoyed using bitcoin in every way I could. :(

Your "metrics" are meaningless since its quite obvious that many people ARE, in fact, using them as a currency.  And, since you have nothing in history to compare it to, there's simply no way to match or compare the value to the number of bitcoin sales.
Overstock.com did $1 Million in sales with bitcoin in just one month.  That number &gt; zero... much greater.
It's basically just your *opinion* that the value is too high given what, in your *opinion* again, isn't "enough" adoption to justify said value.
A smart man would just admit that.

I agree that the market is much more flooded with options now, which does spread out the capital to a degree.  However, I believe the new money that arrives on "the scene" during each BTC spike is exactly why LTC always becomes the go-to coin for new people *gambling* on the big exchanges.

1) all operators (machine owners) in the US must register as Money Transmitters in 48 out of 50 states (and D.C.); which, in most cases, requires millions of dollars in insurance bonds, cash reserves, license fees, etc.
2) in addition to the cost of the machine, Robocoin contracts require 30% of annual machine revenue goes  to Robocoin during the first year -- hence the ridiculously high transaction fees we're seeing on these machines. (I think it even increases the second year, but I could be wrong)
3) In order to receive machine maintenance and software upgrades for each machine, you have to also sign up and pay thousands of dollars, per year, for their maintenance contracts
So, um, yeah... good luck selling these!
Note:   items 2 and 3 above may have changed since the last time I reviewed their terms.

I do not believe they intend to collect sender information if you're simply receiving coins -- mainly because that's impossible in most cases.
However, I do believe you will soon be expected to provide identifying information for anyone you send coins to, and I personally feel that's one of the worst aspects of the new proposal.

I have absolutely no clue which coins that is referring to, specifically.
However, it could be referring to the movements of coins in early March that resembled the Gox custom wallet script that broke down large piles into many smaller piles (hot wallets).
The problem with that theory, though, is that the Gox custom wallet software was stolen and leaked by hackers in late February, so literally anyone could have later used it to devide up their own stacks of coins.

Serious question:  short of the coinvalidation bullshit, how is any NY-licensed wallet service EVER going to be able to identify all the recipients of coins sent from their wallets?
That's simply impossible unless they request the identity of the recipient from the sender in each and every transaction.
I know that Coinbase recently implemented a "goods or services, or private wallet" question when you send over a certain amount, but do they really expect us to do that for every single send?

That's fine when you have one wallet, and you only ever use that one wallet for everything from start to finish.
Now, try that with 100+ wallets of every size and shape -- each one of them sending and receiving coins of every type, simultaneously.
I honestly believe that anyone who believes otherwise has simply never tried any of the hundreds of awesome uses and sources for bitcoin.
When you simply buy and hold, or maybe just use it once a month to buy something, you simply cannot fathom what it's like for those of us who have actually been using it to the fullest.

You'll likely be cut off soon from most of the exchanges (ie. Bitstamp) and hosted wallet services (ie. changetip) that are based or incorporated outside of New York.

Honor the blockchain.
Thou shalt not fork thine own family.
Keep the network holy.
Thou should not covet another man's wallet.
Do unto others as you would have them DDoS you.
Thou shalt not swear unto another man that thine payment hath not been received until all of the blockchain hath been downloadeth.
Salt thine passwords.
Hack thine planet.
Keep thine woman, Bruces and Atlases in separate camps if they are unclean.

This system simply won't work until the IRS gets off their collective asses and creates a brand new hybrid asset category that is crypto-specific.
1). See above.
2). Simply unmanageable.  There is no chance in hell the average consumer or merchant will be willing to add a CGT burden to their shopping habit or payments to employees/suppliers, respectively. This will utterly destroy any chance we had for mass adoption.  
3). What happens when miners have an income tax obligation that is actually higher than the worth of their coin holdings?  You can't apply unrealized or realized capital losses to income tax obligations, so what will miners do if their end-of-year income tax obligations are higher than the coins are worth at the end of that year?  This would essentially mean that they'd want to avoid mining during any obvious spike in price, which is absolutely ridiculous.
4). No comment other than the test for being considered a business is cumbersome/ridiculous.
5). Applying this entire concept retroactively is asinine.  Nobody, and I mean nobody, will be able to calculate CGT obligations for every small bitcoin transaction they've made for the last five years.  I guess the only silver lining is that the IRS won't be able to figure that out either.

Alright, I can see how doing forums and DAOs might be easier for you using the Turing compete language built into ethereum, but aren't you worried about building the entire system on a coin/network that is completely untested and potentially very insecure?
Bitcoin itself was extremely insecure in multiple ways when it first launched -- and some argue rightfully that it still is, even with almost 110 PH/s -- so nobody knows how ethereum will turn out.
If ethereum crashes and burns, we'll be right back to where we are now with regards to the Bitcoin Foundation.

I feel that it's dangerous to send bitcoin to someone based on whatever old address you have saved in an address book.  What if that old address was compromised?  What if they lost the key and created a new one?  Or maybe, like me, they generate a new receiving address for every transaction?

They already did exactly that with these guidelines.  Large investors and trading houses don't care if it's taxed just like every other commodity they trade.
They are the group that never planned on using it as a currency in the first place.  For them, it's just another financial play toy that they can use and abuse to make themselves wealthier; so, these new guidelines won't affect them one *bit*! (see what I did there?)

I've got my local bike shop very close to accepting it in store and online.  Right now, their primary concern is whether or not it  integrates easily with their etailer suite.  I told them to reach out to Bitpay or Coinbase to ask them that question directly, so hopefully they figure it out soon!

You only disclose for the specific foreign accounts wherein you held more than $10k USD at any time during that year -- to include each individual foreign-based Bitcoin Exchange that held more than $10k USD following any wired deposit, BTC/USD trade, etc., during that year.
I electronically completed and submitted mine for MtGox last night, and it took all of 15 minutes from start to finish.  The toughest part was tracking down the old street address for Gox, and now my ass is covered.
Too easy.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:16:51
Wouldn't that mean that long-term holders would be taxed annually on *unrealized* gains? (like forex)
That's why this would be just as bad, or worse, than the current situation.
They need to stop trying to force this round peg into all their old square holes, and then get off their asses to create an all-new "hybrid" asset category that combines the best of both foreign currency AND commodity taxation.  
Doing anything less will stifle innovation and Bitcoin adoption, period.

Here's the rub:
Let's say you buy 0.34 BTC at one price (basis1), and then later buy 0.2 BTC at a different price (basis2).  
Those 0.54 BTC are now combined and sitting in one wallet.
Now, what happens when you make a retail purchase that totals 0.5 BTC?  Which cost basis is used? Just the first one, or both?  Do you literally have to pay CGT using the basis1 for 0.34 of the purchase, and then use basis2 for remaining 0.16 of that same purchase?
Now, try that same thing with 20 separate BTC acquisitions at 20 different prices, and then 100 different small purchases around town.
It's f'n retarded and borderline impossible to calculate and report all of that shit... :(

The bank's fraud department might flag your activity as "stacking" deposits -- frequent cash deposits of amounts that don't meet the FinCIN or IRS reporting threshold, but still total a large amount when added together -- which is how some criminals try to launder their money.

Satoshi never mentioned taxes in his white paper, so nobody "created a currency that has capital gains."

I don't think most of you guys get it. Considering that most bitcoin-related companies, including simple bitcoin ATM operators, must register and be licensed as money transmitting businesses in each state (very expensive!), the creation of a new category of business MAY be a VERY good thing for all of us.
Expecting a total lack of any regulation in our country is completely ignorant.  The best we can hope for is that they see the light and eliminate the MASSIVE barriers to entry that are currently in place if/when you're forced to register as a money transmitting business.
Don't be surprised if/when companies like Western Union get very aggressive (or violent) in preventing the relaxing of such regulations for bitcoin companies...

So you're ok with the fact that changetip would now have to ask you for your ID and proof of home address before you can withdraw the tips you've received?  
That's just one example of the repercussions here.  Since they're obviously not compliant with these regs, services like changetip would need to deny service to all NY residents or face legal action in the same way that offshore online gambling sites face legal action if they service U.S. residents.
And, the only way they can identify NY residents is by adhering to the AML/KYC laws.

Simply put, Bitcoin is great because it is empowering and enlightening. Bitcoin is freedom from control and freedom of expression, and does not rely on the whims of any state for those freedoms.
For the first time in recorded history, a technology exists that can and will empower the entire planet... everyone... everywhere.  Borders, bureaucrats, and bastards will be put to rest, and the masses -- the beautiful people in every corner of the world -- now have a tool at their disposal which will allow them to define their own destinies and success on an equal and practically uncensored basis.
Yes, in my heart of hearts, I truly believe that this technology is that PROFOUND, and that POWERFUL.
The rest of my life will be dedicated to doing my part to bring these possibilities to fruition.  The best part?  I know that I'm not alone.  Millions, and perhaps billions, of other free people, or those desiring freedom, will be there to fight for these powers alongside me.  
TL;DR: Bitcoin is freedom.

They *are* scarce, but the number of them *could be* increased through a hard fork.

That said, the chances of anyone agreeing that there should be more than the 21 million, let alone a majority of full nodes, are slim to none.  Seriously, doing so would absolutely destroy the value of bitcoin given the fact that scarcity is a major factor of said value.

The problem with this bill and the current IRS guidelines is that bitcoin is not just a currency *or* a property -- it actually has the qualities and properties of both! 
Proper tax treatment would involve creating a new "hybrid" asset category that is specific to the very unique nature of crypto currencies.
While the accounting burden would be lessened If they categorize it as a type of foreign currency, the tax burden (amount you have to pay every year) may actually be higher.

See my post above.  BTCchina's new maker/taker system is definitely NOT the reason the market is floating sideways right now.  (BTCchina no longer has the volume to lead the trading trends.  Their new system has little or no bearing on the exchanges that actually matter now).
It's not Overstock.com either.
This is completely normal market activity -- even in extremely volatile markets.  It's called consolidation.

You could also *potentially* lose it all.
You can and should invest more conservatively and with more diversity (in terms of risk).
Only invest in bitcoin what you can afford to lose.  Going all in 100% bitcoin is just about the most irresponsible thing you could ever do.
You have an obligation to your children not to be a total fool by potentially losing it all in one bet.
Don't be that fool.  Your childrens' lives depend on it.
Edit: Sell the house, pay off your debts, then invest some money in an IRA, some in a 529 college fund, and some in bitcoin.  You can later redirect some of the IRA funds toward bitcoin ETFs once they become available, and you can also set aside a few dollars to buy tiny amounts of BTC every month thereafter... this is called SMART investing for your family's future.

Willy had absolutely nothing to do with the spike in November.  China traders led every rally, every day.  Everyone and everything else merely followed.
And, Willy's total volume for the year was closer to 270k, not 650k.
To put that in perspective, that's fewer bought coins than any single China exchange for any given week in late November and December 2013.
At most, Willy provided a tiny bit of liquidity when there was a lull in the trading.  The **real** whales did all the rest.

To answer your initial question:  I honestly don't know.  However, I'm certainly not going to just take them at their word or settle for them simply asking miners to please leave after they reach 40%.  Neither of those comes close to satisfying our *need* for confidence and security.

I'm guessing they'll be similar to the current bond requirements for a Money Transmitter License -- which range from $500k to $3M, depending on state.  (Which translates to roughly $50k-$250k per year in bond payments)

Well, I guess 180k would be a decent start; but, it would also guarantee that Gox would have to function as a fractional reserve in order to collect the remaining balance through fees.
Something tells me that most victims of Gox would be ok with that, though -- especially with reserves at nearly 20% at the start.
Or perhaps everyone would simply get 20% of what they lost?  That would certainly be better than nothing at all, but it would still hurt pretty badly...

If "nobody wanted the things," Coinbase and Bitpay wouldn't be able to sell them on the open market.  The only accurate statement would be that "nobody *currently* wants them at a higher price."
Also, everything you're describing is something that will happen in due time once more and more suppliers and manufacturers begin to use Bitcoin.  It will take a great deal of time to get there, but I have no doubt whatsoever that it will happen.
If a merchant can save several parentage points by paying both their employees and suppliers using Bitcoin -- which they certainly can -- they'd be ignorant and irresponsible not to do so.

I intentionally held everything in my real name everywhere I went.  Coinbase, Cryptsy, Gox, BTCe, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, BTER, MCXnow, and a few others... my coins and real name have been almost everywhere in this ecosystem! (I'm obviously not in this for the anonymity... lol).
I tracked every trade knowing full well that I might need to audit those for tax reasons later on.
What I didn't do, however, is track all of the purchases that may or may not have involved coins that appreciated $200, or more.  I honestly have no idea how I'd figure that out even if I wanted to.

Please go back and look at bitcoin's entire history and tell me what you observe with every meteoric rise that occurred asking the entire timeline.
While nobody could predict the exact peak, or the specific event that precipitated that peak (or "pop") in December, basic analysis of the asset's history (and a basic understanding of any growing market) was enough to predict an inevitable retracement (and a consolidation phase).
It's not my fault, or anyone else's here, that some other new traders didn't know that.  It's not our fault if others don't know anything about markets and trading. 
And, it's not our fault if they invest more than they can afford to lose.

You're misinterpreting it.  Nowhere does it say that fees will increase or decrease at pre-determined points, or to pre-determined values.
The fee rates are determined by miners themselves.  They are free to set their pool to whatever minimum fee they wish; however, the current standard is generally decided upon through lengthy open discussions -- hence the 1/10th reduction last week.
Once the final coin is mined, the free market itself will determine the fee amount that is most common and widely used.  Obviously, the fee will need to allow the miners to continue to profit, but there's simply no way in hell to determine what that will be in the year 2140 since we have no clue what energy and equipment costs will be like at that time.
Hell, the governments around the world may even run non-profit data centers to facilitate the network indefinitely.
Bottom line:  just as it's impossible to predict the distant future value of Bitcoin itself, it's also nearly impossible to predict the future of transaction fees.  So, claiming that it will eternally increase, especially given last week's dramatic DECREASE, is just plain ignorant.

Xapo executives themselves have said as much on multiple occasions, and as recently as last week.  They have a private insurance firm that they co-own that scales 100% alongside the number of coins stored at Xapo.  The insurance reserves are held in bitcoin itself, so they keep a 1:1 ratio of stored coins to insured coins.  
In other words, if they store 50,000 bitcoins for customers, their insurance provider maintains an additional 50,000 BTC to match.  This, of course, scales much better than a USD-denominated insurance solution that would itself be impossible to sustain if/when bitcoin goes to the moon.
There is no doubt whatsoever that the reddit interpretation of the ToS last week was incorrect.  Unless, of course, you doubt their  executives' statements and corporate/insurance structure itself.

I'm originally from Germany, and half of my entire family are German citizens (im Bayern).
Many of my uncles there would disagree with you.
For those of you who don't know, Bayern (or "Bavaria" in English) is the southern-most part of Germany.  It's a very rural area, and most of the Germans there feel very differently about issues than those from the northern areas in Germany.  (Kinda like the differences between north and south in the U.S.)
The "vast majority" of the German citizens, and Europeans in general, have been cowed by their leadership during the last 100 years... like my new friend above.

The remittance market, obviously.  70% of the world is under or un-banked.
Political and charity donations can finally provide accountability (Real time transparency), and each of those will save on processing fees -- your donations will finally reach their intended recipients in full.
Limited or no transfer fees, especially for larger amounts.
Smart contracts versus in-person contracts.
Digital Autonomous Corporations -- essentially online "entities" that conduct business autonomously (or with very little human administration).
Possibly electronic voting (if we can overcome the sybil attack issue).
And, of course, a modicum of individual liberty and privacy that the established banking systems can't/won't provide.
Merchants will no longer be forced out of business due to chargeback fraud, and they can save 2-5% in processing fees.  Some large businesses operate on very slim profit margins.  If those can save even 1% on fees, that amounts to countless millions in retained revenue.
The issuance of securities or stocks (colored coins).
Personal asset management -- ie. deeds, titles, etc.  (Again, colored coins).
And, there are potentially many many other uses that we haven't even dreamed of yet, or that still only exist as science fiction (ie. Self-driving taxi vehicles that utilize crypto currencies to pay for their own recharges and maintenance)

That only solves the problem for coins bought and used in the service's wallet.  If the consumer transfers in coins from elsewhere, it would be impossible for the payment processor to know the information necessary to calculate CGT on those "foreign" coins when they're later used in a transaction.
And you also didn't comment on the burden now placed on businesses that hold coins to pay their employees and suppliers -- both events now require CGT calculations that don't exist with cash, PayPal, or credit cards.
Seriously, how is a mom and pop shop going to track all of that? Why would they bother?

To be fair, ripple itself was never meant to have any real value. The free market just ended up giving it value when Ripple Labs completely fucked up and limited the distribution.
Stellar is Jed's solution to that.  Rather than keeping 90% -- as Ripple Labs did with Ripple, thus screwing it up -- he's literally giving away 95% of it instead.
At its core, it's meant to be an ultra fast vehicle for transmitting and converting to and from any currency, not just crypto.  If it works, we will be able to send dollars or euros just as easily as we can send bitcoin today, and we can do so without central banks controlling (and skimming) said transaction.
And, since there's so many Stellars in existence, they hopefully won't gain in value as much, or as rapidly, as the Ripple garbage.
It's a worthwhile experiment, for sure, so at the very least it will be interesting to watch...

I have a rather small pile of coins, and it's still a nightmare to try and figure out the origin and exact price for every small fraction of coin I've obtained over the last year.
Can you imagine what it would be like for U.S.citizens who possess hundreds or thousands of coins collected from hundreds or thousands of various sources over the last four years?

With all due respect to Mr. Brito, he did NOT answer the tax question very well at the end.  Simply mentioning that many/most users of Bitcoin will file for extensions does nothing to address the nearly impossible task of tracking down and calculating the gains/losses on coins obtained and used a thousand or more different ways over the last five years.
For starters, not all bitcoin trades and transactions are recorded on the bitcoin blockchain.  A few examples that come to mind:  social media tips, exchange trades, bitcoin and alt coin faucets, alt coin mining, etc etc.  
In those cases, you could literally receive a thousand different small deposits throughout a year, with each one being a tiny fraction of a coin.  In terms of calculating capital gains, each and every one of those tiny acquisitions (or losses) would involve a different cost basis, and you'd also have to account for FIFO to ultimately figure out which of those coin fractions are used when you purchase a simple $5 cup of coffee.
The complexity of that record-keeping requirement is mind blowing, and the panel did nothing to highlight that fact.

"Also because gold bullion coins are made by the United States Mint, they are legal tender that has to be accepted at its face value.  However, it would not be advisable spend a $50 dollar gold bullion coin that weighs one ounce and is worth $1,310 at today’s prices.  Further, the Constitution of the United States allows for gold and silver to be used as an alternate currency.  So states like Utah have made it legal to use gold coins as currency at market value without capital gains taxes.  Unfortunately the Constitution does not allow for bitcoin as an alternative currency but does offer an interesting precedent"

@_date: 2014-07-31 23:34:52
I might argue, perhaps unsuccessfully, that such old systems are fragile (or vulnerable) in other ways.  For example, since they cannot be changed out or upgraded, they're vulnerable to technological demands they can't handle.
They are also vulnerable from a supply perspective since only one company on the planet still manufacturers and services their systems.
While vulnerable and fragile may have slightly different meanings, maybe they're close enough in definition to made my point?

It can be "attacked" in a similar fashion, just not with any of the scrypt-based coins mentioned by the author.  The reason is that bitcoin miners can't simply switch over to litecoin or any of the other scrypt-based coins since their mining equipment, known as ASICS, cannot be used for anything other than sha256-based coins.  They would need to replace *all* of their mining equipment, which is cost-prohibitive, to say the least.
I also wouldn't classify this possibility as an "attack," as most people who understand Bitcoin also understand that it *could* be replaced by something better in the future if/when there are good reasonS (plural) to switch.
Like I said, the author is a moron.
You are too, apparently.

All changes do require miners to change.  However, as I said, they can be *forced* to do so if the majority of full nodes and payment processors switch.
The miners could refuse to switch at that point, even, but they'd no longer be mining a coin the majority refer to as Bitcoin, and the majority would no longer be using their old version of the coin.

From the Federal law enforcement perspective, the use of exploit code against a subject is the virtual equivalent of a B&amp;E.
The FBI itself is not authorized, as an agency, to run around the Internet compromising whichever host they want to using exploits.
In order to do so, they need a warrant.  On the warrant, they'd be asked to provide the identify of the system owner, location of the system, and any other justification and information they have. 
Therefore, they must use other  means to obtain that information that do not involve exploit code (aka B&amp;E).
In this case, since the IP, host service, server location, and identities were all unknown at the time, they obviously did not have what they needed for a warrant, so they did not have authorization or jurisdiction to use exploit code to obtain said information.  They are/were allowed to passively observe traffic and the home pages, but that's where their legal authorities ended without a warrant.
Once again, this is why the affidavit claims they typed in random information to the input fields and not exploit code.  If they admit to using code, rather than random typing, then they'd also be admitting to overstepped their authorities and jurisdiction without a warrant.

100% agreed, and I was the first to discover and report the existence of the bot on heck, I even selected the name Willy! (after soliciting name suggestions on the live Bonavest Trading Show one night)
China led the rise every day of November and early December... not Willy.  China also led the crash back down... not Willy.
Willy did not cause or drive the "bubble" any more than you or I did.  At most, he simply provided tiny bits of liquidity on Gox whenever nobody else was trading.  However, whenever daily rallies started in China, it was the **real** whales on Gox -- people buying and selling hundreds and thousands of coins at a time very rapidly -- that **actually** moved the market in both directions.
Willy was interesting, and he definitely accumulated a large number of coins over time, but he had little to nothing to do with the "bubble." Period.

His thoughts are actually well articulated, and quite reasonable, so the knee-jerk posts here are kinda silly.
That said, I think he ignored (or simply missed) several of the more ridiculous aspects of the proposal -- ie. Requiring a license to "issue a virtual currency," and also having to provide PII for every recipient in a transaction sent from a NYDFS-compliant wallet.
It's also absurd that every exchange and hosted wallet service in the world is expected to identify and block access to NY residents if they (those worldwide services) are not fully NYDFS compliant.
In other words, Michael isn't addressing some of the worst aspects of the proposal, so he needs to go back and revisit those if he wants to be taken seriously...

It's worth checking out, but my guess is that they're going to fuck it up with exorbitant fees.
It's also likely that this will eliminate the merchants' primary incentive to take bitcoin since it negates the savings normally had when using bitcoin instead of CC transactions.

It's actually bad news for merchants who planned to eventually pay their suppliers with bitcoin, though.  Now, they'll have to keep track of every coin they receive, and then calculate capital gains tax implications if/when they use that coin to pay their employees or suppliers sometime in the future.
The fact that CGT has to be calculated for EVERY instance wherein bitcoin is actually used as a currency is REALLY bad news. :(

Other than posting a warning to potential investors that exchanges like Gox are exceedingly risky places to park your coins -- which is/was a well-known fact throughout the entire community... it was reiterated daily... everywhere -- what could/should the BTCF have really *done*, specifically?
It seems to me that people just want someone else to blame for their own mistakes, poor decisions, or just plain bad luck.
I really truly feel bad for those who lost money on Gox, but I just don't see what going after the BTCF members can/will accomplish at this point.
Unless they are complicit in actual crimes, the rest is just misdirected anger for the sake of having someone else to blame...

Many of you keep using the 850k figure when calculating percentages and discussing reimbursements; but, wasn't it broken down as 750k customer coins and 100k coins belonging to Gox itself (or Mark himself)?

For crypto, monetary value = speculation + (market cap / supply)
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:41:13
Not true.  The value is established by what the majority of people, full nodes, and payment processors refer to as "Bitcoin."  If the miners stubbornly refuse to follow, they'd no longer be mining the coin referred to as "Bitcoin" by said majority.
They'd be quickly incentivised to return to the fold, or risk being stuck mining their own worthless alt.

There were a few articles right after it happened that included comments from anonymous former employees, but I'm guessing those were just IRC chats with Delerium, Sarahbitcoin, etc -- those were just the remote support folks contracted to help out on IRC.

So what do we do in the meantime?  This will seriously hamper adoption until we can figure out a way to track all of this without burdening consumers, and without scaring away just about everyone who is in this for the pseudonymity.
I'm not sure that tracking the data is even possible without negating or seriously hampering many of the OTHER benefits of bitcoin -- such as private cold storage, transferring coins between your own wallets, direct remittance transfers, quick transfers to friends and family, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:14:50
Many of their stuck TX changed from category "Large Transaction (LT)" to normal once they were automatically reissued.  Those were then usually stuck a second time due to "Outputs Already Spent."
Does that indicate that different inputs were used the second time?  I wish I had screen captures of my own stuck withdrawals in January, but I never did grab any... :(

You cannot wire cash or transfer gold around the world without involving a third party.
And, you don't have CGT obligations when you buy something with fiat, or receive fiat for a sale.  You only have CGT obligations on fiat if you trade the actual fiat on foreign currency exchanges.
In the case of bitcoin, you now have CGT obligations when you use it as currency AND when you trade it on currency exchanges -- that's both new and profound, and it's exactly why the IRS should have created an entirely new asset category.
Treating it as just property is completely unacceptable...
@_date: 2014-09-17 23:54:26
Third party services like Changetip can fill that gap with little or no fees by processing the micro-payments off-chain.  While the innovation of the blockchain obviously isn't the basis for the individual payments, the process of depositing and withdrawing funds in the accounts is still made much more efficient and cheaper using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:29:02
The selling has already happened.  There is a TON of customer fiat sitting in Gox right now.  Once btc withdrawals are turned back on, there will absolutely be a buying frenzy as people use that fiat to buy up all the cheap Gox coins to transfer them elsewhere.

While that's obviously true, the price isn't the only factor driving demand for bitcoin right now.  Some sectors or entities are viewing it as a necessity -- in order to become or remain competitive in the coming markets -- not just as an investment.

It'll happen this year.  Once Kraken finishes registering in all 50 states and secures a NY-based bank after NYDFS releases their regulations in Q2, my bet is that Kraken quickly becomes the go-to exchange for the U.S.

"over 200 transactions"?

200 transactions is roughly $12 USD in fees, at the most.

I think the damage to the ecosystem would quickly extend well beyond the U.S. borders, and it probably wouldn't be too difficult for the U.S. to convince the EU and others to sign treaties to implement the same "clean address" requirements worldwide.
The U.S. also happens to be the largest Bitcoin market in the world right now, so even if the primary damage is limited to the U.S. market, the entire ecosystem would feel the shock and the price would tank worldwide almost overnight.
@_date: 2014-07-10 15:11:45

A network of banks could leverage blockchain technology internally to facilitate inter-bank transactions without worrying about PoW mining.  Every bank could be a full node, and the ledger would simply track the balances of each of those nodes.
At the end of the day, their system wouldn't really resemble Bitcoin, but it could still take advantage of the distributed and cryptographic aspects without much effort.
Something like that, anyways...
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:30:56
No, it really doesn't.  For every seller, there needs to be a buyer.
So, while such massive dumps would certainly reduce the price to almost zero (temporarily) if they were done on an exchange, those coins would not just cease to exist.  In fact, such an event would simply redistribute them more evenly, so the whole thing couldn't even be repeated more than once.
I highly doubt such a thing would happen anyways.  The more likely scenario would involve the early adopters selling large chunks of coins privately.  Such sales have little or no effect on the exchange prices elsewhere.  In fact, many of them have already done so.   
I really don't think you've thought this through... your entire doom-and-gloom theory is itself fatally flawed.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:24:05

Again, only where it directly touches fiat accounts (ie. Exchanges), and they've been handling it individually just fine (like any other trading exchange or bank that asks for an ID to open an account).

The only impact they would have had is that MtGox would have needed to identify and deny service to any/all NY residents.  Failure to do so would have led to prosecution.
And that's exactly what exchanges and hosted wallets the world over now face, and it will only get worse once these regs propagate throughout the U.S.

Not so much... hell, not even close.
My meager pile of a few dozen coins was compiled from:  private cash buys, Coinbase orders, exchange trades, alt coin mining, social media tips, satoshi dice, gifts, faucets, payments for items sold on craigslist, etc etc.  The vast majority of those gains and losses weren't even recorded in the blockchain, and many (most?) of them involved small fractions of coins.
I had several hundred, if not 1000+, individual gains and losses of every possible size during the last year... so, please tell me again how simple it should be?  
I sat down to try and figure it all out the other night and gave up after 45 minutes.
We will definitely need software to prevent this issue in the future if we have any chance of satisfying the IRS requirements -- especially considering the countless new uses and sources of bitcoin that are dreamed up every single day.

I believe the majority number of nodes running any version, and the majority of businesses tired to any version, trump the majority hashing power of miners.  And, the current number of independent full nodes is dramatically higher than the number of miners.
So, as far as I know, if everyone running full nodes switched to a new version of Bitcoin, the miners would have to follow suit or be stuck mining their own independent coin.
Tl;dr = nodes have more power over the network than miners, in terms of which software version we call "Bitcoin."

A simple purchase of a $25 t-shirt might involve 50+ fractional gains -- all obtained on different days and at different prices through alt coin mining, reddit tips, etc.
Picture buying a $1000 TV using the same pile if coins.  That single purchase may involve calculating capital gains on 100+ fractional coin deposits, or more.  (Not to mention the 1099 form also required for a purchase that size... doh!)
You obviously have a "simple" or straightforward pile of coins if you can't understand or relate to this issue.  However, some of us have been playing with and using this coin in every way imaginable.  For us, the concept of tracing back every small acquisition and loss is being reason or sense... it's simply not possible.

Your analogy isn't great, but you're absolutely correct that future performance is not guaranteed.
That doesn't matter, though.  I was asking the troll why he insists that this time is different.  He obviously believes that a drop of more than 50% is the death knell for bitcoin, but that can't be true since it's happened so many times in the past -- each time rising to a new ATH 7-8 months later.
This time could certainly be different, but the troll has never stated why that is the case.

I'm hardly the first person to suggest this since the IRS guidelines came out -- nearly everyone has been saying "we can do this with software" -- but, this post is the first call for a standard that I know of.
For the life of me, I honestly can't figure out why anyone would object to such a suggestion... The negative reaction here is astounding.

Fine by me.  Anything would be better than this, and I don't see Germany, UK, Netherlands, and elsewhere having any problem with hybrid categories that don't include impossible record keeping.
Simple purchases don't require doing calculus in any of those other countries, so why does the U.S. IRS think it would be ok here?

And if they did?  So what?  Again, why does it matter so much?
The code is open source, and 75% of it has been changed since the last time SN touched it.  Trust in the code as it stands right now, not in its original creator(s).
No good can come from rooting out a person, or persons, who obviously want to be left alone.

@_date: 2014-04-08 22:39:47
When using it as a currency, it's the accounting burden that's the problem, not the price -- which is exactly what would happen if the $200 rule on foreign currencies isn't raised and they switch BTC to be treated as a foreign currency.
Like I said, we'd be right back to where we are now with the draconian accounting burden preventing its use as an actual currency.

In the comments, he described the VC parties as being most interested in HOW they built such a large community so quickly, and also how the social media "tipping thing" worked.  It was apparently quite clear that they didn't have the first clue what crypto currencies are, so he had to explain that to them.  He also supposedly told them that it was the community that built everything up themselves, not himself or any one person.
It sounds to me like his plan is to make doge more popular by becoming "the coin that works WITH governments, not against them." 
It will be interesting to see how the doge community reacts.  My guess is that most of them don't really give a shit what ultimately happens with the governments and crypto...

no such foresight here.  let's see what I can do...
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:13:17
The word "residual" means left over, as in after.  It's an adjective meant to describe the remaining substantial demand following the auction, and does not refer to or negate the demand today or since day one.
Mathematically, in this case:
Residual demand = total demand today minus that of the winning bidders.
Prior to this post, too many here were ignoring or forgetting the bullish nature of having many wealthy parties still interested in tens of thousands of coins AFTER the auction is concluded.
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:07:34
Alleged.  To remain fair and reasonable, you still need to use the word 'alleged' until he's actually convicted by a court of law.

Stop moving the goalposts.  Your argument was that fees would increase.  I pointed out that you're wrong.  So now you're shifting to volatility and the inability to predict fee structures?

Taxes have always been about extortion.  But, in this case, they have the power of a government behind it.
The bottom line is that you actually only paid $4.75 USD for the t-shirt -- the operative term being "USD."
Therefore, even with the CGT, you come out way ahead.
These guidelines don't make purchases more expensive in terms of USD.  Instead, they simply make them much more burdensome.  It's that unnecessary and detrimental burden that we should be concerned about, not any added USD costs (because there aren't any).

It takes some fairly abstract  thinking to understand the vision I briefly described above, but it's not unimaginable.
Try to imagine, just for a second, all of your personal reputation and productivity (perhaps as a measure of time, hours) represented as a coin with value that is individually pegged against bitcoin.  You have a finite number of JorijnsmitCoins -- perhaps exactly 168 coins per week to represent hours.  You could then trade your personal coin with various employers using some type of smart contract to control/moderate/arbitrate the trade.  Once your obligation to the employer has been fulfilled, the smart contract could burn your coins as "used," and issue you a payment from the employer in the coin of your choice in return.
In this way, all of your productivity, availability, and experience could/would be accountable in the blockchain(s).
Again, this is sci-fi type shit, but it's big fun to sit around imagining the possibilities... :)

I've held the titles "Software Engineer," "Network Engineer," "Information Security Specialist," and even "Computer Scientist" during my long career in this space.  Each and every position I've held has required me to be part engineer, part researcher, and part mechanic.  
So, it simply blows my mind that anyone who has supposedly *earned* the title of "CS Professor" wouldn't be a mix of all of those things, as well.  It's even more mind-boggling that they'd be unable to audit a Windows machine to see which user installed certain files.  
If all they did was try to hide it deep within the file system, then it *should* be trivial for anyone with the title of "CS Professor" to figure out which user was involved.  In fact, someone with that title *should* be able to teach the entire IT department how to do the same.
I guess the CS "professors" from 20+ years ago were just a different caliber... cut from a finer geek cloth, if you will.   Their lessons didn't end with just lines of code and theories.

IMO, the following is the most interesting paragraph:
"Also because gold bullion coins are made by the United States Mint, they are legal tender that has to be accepted at its face value.  However, it would not be advisable spend a $50 dollar gold bullion coin that weighs one ounce and is worth $1,310 at today’s prices.  Further, the Constitution of the United States allows for gold and silver to be used as an alternate currency.  So states like Utah have made it legal to use gold coins as currency at market value without capital gains taxes.  Unfortunately the Constitution does not allow for bitcoin as an alternative currency but does offer an interesting precedent."
This entire issue could be resolved if Congress creates a law that equates bitcoin to gold and silver.  Simple, elegant, and complete.

2) Third party payment processors were "asked" to cut ties with any/all bitcoin businesses NLT 31 January.
Bank deposits and withdrawals have been completely legal the entire time.

Bottom line:  it certainly goes in the PRO column, rather than the CON.
I don't want he/she taking it if they don't support the underlying purpose of the currency, though -- that being a break from centralized financial control.  
In other words, if they take it as a candidate, they better not support any legislation that stifles crypto innovation if/when they get into office.  That level of hypocrisy would piss me off to no end...

French francs are a currency.  British pounds sterling are a currency.  Euros are a currency.
If I use Visa to buy something on a U.S. website, and then pay my Visa bill using any of the above currencies, Visa converts/processes one type of currency for another.
The exact same thing is true if I pay using Bitpay and bitcoin.
Bitcoin is just another currency, and Bitpay is just another processor.
Differentiating between fiat and bitcoin, in this case, IS F'N DERP, and I'm sick of seeing this fallacy spread as gospel.

You're failing to account for the 1% fee Coinbase would charge you to cash out the bitcoin.

I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong about bitcoin fitting neatly into the "property" asset category.
When it's actually used as a currency, the required accounting is simply too much of a burden.

That's the point.  It WAS going to be an exchange for MTG cards, but that never actually happened.  Instead, it became a bitcoin exchange in 2010 that Mark Karpeles later purchased and took control of in 2011.  After he purchased MtGox, he used PHP to patch together what is obviously the worst custom wallet and exchange implementation in all of Bitcoin.

The thing is, I understand all of the above quite well.  However, gmaxwell's suggestion does not interfere with current exchange operations or code... it's separate.  
Put simply, and as far as I understand, it's just a tool that is run against the db on a daily or weekly basis to calculate a few values, create a hash for authenticity/integrity, and then present those values on a web page -- at no time does it integrate or interfere directly with any of the actual exchange operations and code.  
So yes, while you would need to load test it to ensure that it doesn't impact performance of the db while the tool is being run, you wouldn't need to worry about modifying and testing the actual exchange code.

Can you provide specific examples from his list that should be given a second chance to prove they're not paid shills?
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:33:10
In laymens' terms:  every time it has risen dramatically (possible "bubbles"), the falls afterwards (known as retracement), have been less and less severe.
When the market only retraces to a level that is still 500% above the value prior to the bubble, this shows that "support" for that market has increased dramatically.  
Retracement, or what you've affectionately labeled as "shitting the bed," is a natural and predictable event in all markets.  In fact, this phenomenon happens on a much smaller scale each and every day with nearly every stock, currency, and commodity on the planet.  When the value increases dramatically for any one of those, a retracement will ALWAYS follow once the market meets the peak resistance.  
The support will determine the severity of the retracement.
In the case of Bitcoin, the level of support following each and every bubble has risen by an every-increasing percentage, thus also lessening the percentages of each drop in price.
TL;DR -- Bitcoin's level of support in the markets continues to grow at an amazing rate. Subsequently, each retracement following a bubble has become less and less severe.
@_date: 2014-04-05 05:19:27
The thing is, this capability goes well beyond bitcoin.  If it works like I understand it to work, the "Bit Store" could just be the first application.
They could release an unofficial app store for indie games, porn apps, or just about any other category of apps that Apple usually denies -- and all without requiring a jailbreak!
Better yet, the apps would all be cross-platform.

Your words:


Again, Willy's small 10-20 btc purchases -- each and every one of them spaced out between five and ten minutes -- did not result in any measurable upward pressure on the market.
Go watch bitfinex right now.  Imagine a 15 btc purchase every 10 minutes, then come back here and tell us again that such small purchases are anything more than microscopic hiccups throughout any given day.
While you're focused on total accumulation over a three month period, and some crazy notion that whoever owned Willy never sold any of those coins during that time, I'm telling you that the day to day effect of Willy's activity was slim to none.
If you honestly believe that small 10-20 btc buys would move any of these markets, even today when trading volumes are much smaller than last November, you're just plain nuts...

I've actually never converted any of the coins for cash or withdrawn to my bank account.  However, there were countless times I traded for USD, and back, in the exchanges. (I also believe that each and every one of those trades to USD and back in the exchanges is considered a taxable event, which is why I saved the trading histories everywhere I went).
The coins themselves were also received using many different methods -- cash via localbitcoins, bank transfers to Coinbase, social media tips, mining alt coins, direct in-person trades for goods via Craigslist, etc.
I probably made 50 small purchases with bitcoin, both in person and online, during the year.

Those are all exchanges wherein fiat and bitcoin intersect.  I was referring to any/all *other*  businesses that accept bitcoin (ie. merchants).  What's to stop the government from leveraging CV to make validation (or sender address registration) a requirement for *every* U.S. bitcoin transaction?  Why even give them the f'n tools to do so?  Unless, of course, your goal is to make tons of money by becoming the government's ~~bitch~~ clearinghouse for "valid" bitcoin users...?
My local grocery doesn't require ID when I use fiat cash to purchase toilet paper.  However, CV provides regulators with the means to require ID with every transaction I ever conduct.
One of Bitcoin's greatest advantages is the ability to pay digitally without handing over my personally identifiable information.
The CV fucktards are actively working to destroy that feature, which has the added bonus of destroying bitcoin's fungibility.
You keep saying that exchanges already ask for ID for KYC/AML.  Why can't we simply let them keep doing so? 
It's very reasonable to assume that the government would use the CV clearinghouse for much more than just exchanges, and you're not going to convince me otherwise...

I'd create a new crypto-currency specific asset category with its own set of rules and obligations that are unique to crypto and only crypto.
I'd be damn sure not to burden consumers with tracking each and every purchase they ever make with crypto, and then I'd move on to ensuring the same is true for merchants that decide to hold/use crypto for their payrolls and supply chain.
Finally, I'd find a way to not chase miners offshore. 
Bottom line:  I'd be much more creative and my suggested rules would be crypto-friendly, and crypto-specific.

@_date: 2014-08-21 03:29:05
No, I'm really not.
Buying bitcoins isn't "spending money."  Why?  Because bitcoins ARE money.  I'm simply converting one type of money for another.
Therefore, instantly buying more coins to replace any I spend does not equate to spending twice as much money.
It's basically the same thing as carrying $100 and 60£ in the same wallet.  If you spend the $100 and then convert the 60£ into $100 to have USD on hand, are you "spending" twice as much money?
The answer is no.
Do you even bitcoin?

@_date: 2014-09-19 15:42:15
Full nodes outnumber miners, and payment processors obviously get to choose which version of the blockchain they call "Bitcoin" and use for merchant processing.
Therefore, if a hard fork every happens that miners refuse to change over to, people who run full nodes, as well as the major payment processors, will ultimately decide which version of the chain we call "Bitcoin."  
At that point, miners would be forced to either switch to the chain that was determined by majority rule, or they could continue mining their own version of the chain that said majority isn't using anymore.
In that way, it's a fact that full node operators + payment processors have more "Bitcoin version voting power" than miners.
Make sense?

I'm referring to the current IRS guidelines, which DO require you to know the exact cost basis for each and every fraction of coin you've ever accumulated.
I'm positively convinced that the only people who believe it's feasible are those who either a) don't own any bitcoin, or b) never did anything more interesting or complicated than buy and hold their bitcoin.
However, some of us have actually used, abused, and played with just about every bitcoin function on the planet.  For those of us who have done so, honest and accurate compliance with the existing IRS guidelines is an absolute impossibility.
Seriously, it can't be done.  Period.
The only possible option users like me have is to pull a value straight out of our asses, apply that value to every coin we currently hold, and then move forward without ever looking back -- all the while praying that we simply never get audited.

You do realize that this update to bitcoinxt is not an actual hard fork, right?
This is meant to evaluate actual support for the increase. They can measure the consensus by observing how many nodes run XT versus Core, and they can do so BEFORE the new block size rules go into effect next March.
If they see that the vast majority switch to XT -- including most miners, exchanges, and processors -- then they will know whether or not they have genuine consensus for the ACTUAL hard fork rules scheduled for March 2016.
It's like one gigantic version-check used as a voting mechanism.

Actually, I absolutely know that I'm making the world a better place and genuinely changing people's (and animals') lives for the better.
I also make fantastic money in my day job -- easily top 3% in the U.S. -- so that's not a factor either.
Simple and straight-forward loans for new businesses, products, and services existed long before the invention of speculative investment vehicles and the advent of debt-based spending with money that doesn't even exist.
Private VC investing in new start-ups is a far cry from a bunch of douchebag HF traders and other speculators sitting around a table betting on people's mortgages and lives using money that's not even truly theirs to bet with.
The U.S. government should have let every last one of you burn to the ground in 2008.  I would have thrown an epic f'n party to celebrate!  The "speculators jumping off bridges" event would have been the perfect climax for my week-long festival! :)

Each of the major drops during the last four years has gotten progressively smaller, in terms of percentage.  
You can't argue with da maths.
Is it still very volatile?  Absolutely!  However, it's *definitely* less volatile now than it has ever been in the past.
As the market cap increases, while the confidence and support grows, the drops will continue to become less and less severe -- until we finally reach  stability and the volatility becomes essentially nil. 
The best part:  this progression is accelerating, dramatically.

Absolutely.  If the winning bids are higher than the current market average, and the winning bidders announce that fact, we could very well see the entire market move up to cover that gap.
Of course, the reverse is true, as well.
Worst case is that we never find out the bids, and we're right where we are today after a couple of days of wild and speculative trading.

You're wrong.  Here's why:  A very large portion of my own pile of coins was accumulated in OFF-CHAIN transactions, to include every alt coin I ever mined, and every exchange trade I've ever made.  None of those events are recorded in the blockchain, yet every single one of them is a taxable event.
My two piles of coins consist of coins from THOUSANDS of individual transactions -- the vast majority of which are not in any blockchain, and hundreds of those transactions were done on sites that no longer exist (so no logs to reference).
I'm guessing you're just a simple hodler that never traded or did anything more interesting or complex with your coins... amiright?

Speak for yourself, as that all depends on how much you're trading with.
As an example, a full leverage short position of just one bitcoin at $640 on bitfinex would have netted you approximately $200 if you closed today (minus swap fees).  The same position with just 4 BTC would have netted you around $800 (again, minus swap fees).
Finally, picture doing that with 20+ BTC... or 100+ BTC... and see how quickly those profits add up!
There's always money to be made if you're good at what you do...
Full disclosure:  I'm not a very good trader, so I didn't play in July.

Nodes outnumber miners by a very large margin; so, ultimately it will be full nodes and payment processors who decide which version of the blockchain we call "Bitcoin" (in the case of a hard fork).  Whichever version of the fork they choose will win, and all miners will have to decide between mining their own coin, or real Bitcoin.

If you actually sell at a peak, as you said, then buying back in afterwards would *not* be at a loss.  You'd actually be able to by more coins than you had before.
It's only an issue if the price per coin has gone *higher* since you sold; but, even then the total fiat value won't change regardless of what price you are forced to buy back in if you're intent is to transfer them elsewhere to cash out to fiat.
That said, they also hold some bitcoin withdrawals and require the same answers, so this isn't limited to fiat withdrawals.

Actually, mixers don't "take" your private key because they are actually taking temporary possession of the coins themselves -- in their own wallets.  They then resend those coins out to an address of your choice.
Made no mistake, using most mixers involves temporarily handing over complete control of your coins to a third party -- similar to any exchange or hosted wallet service.

His point was that total hashrate reductions no longer matter (unless hashrate approaches zero).  If 50% of the miners turn off their machines tomorrow, the difficulty factor would also drop shortly afterwards, and everything would rebalance itself again.

There is no evidence whatsoever that Coinbase is using anything beyond one hop of any coin's history to approve or deny transfers.
In other words, they're not doing "taint analysis."  Instead, they're simply scanning for known direct transfer addresses (to/from Coinbase) that violate their ToS.
If it was discovered that they're actually doing taint analysis -- IOW examining the entire history of any transfer address -- that would be a huge deal and have implications for the entire ecosystem.

The logistics problem is that the wallet services have no clue where/when the consumers' coins originated before they arrive at their wallets.  
My current pile of coins has been around the world a dozen times -- some were bought, some were received as tips, some were traded for, and yet others were mined.
I have no realistic way of calculating my own CGT obligations when I use those as currency, so how the hell would a wallet service do so for me?
The only thing they could offer is a way to track the CGT on the coins they themselves sell to a consumer.  Even then, there's no realistic way they could track those obligations if/when the coins leave the original wallet.

Over in the Gox threads on bitcointalk, several members have posted during the last week that they are completely blocked from the "Funding Options" section of their Gox account, and that they're being directed to contact support for more info.
So, perhaps that subset of users *might* be the only ones who are affected by this announcement -- instead of it having anything to do with the recent broken BTC tx issue that is seemingly growing out of control.
Then again, maybe this really is some sort of cover-up for a lack of funds... who knows?!

Some of the newer POW schema are pretty damn effective against ASICs (x11, x13, etc).  Using a series of 11+ hashes, each with a different algorithm, makes it pretty difficult to create one chip that handles each of those efficiently.
Then again, I'm sure you're correct and eventually someone would come up with a dedicated system of some sort that could handle the waterfall hashing better than your average PC. 
That would take a while, though, and it merely brings us back to the point where we are today (in terms of miners).  In the meantime, hundreds of millions of normal everyday people would likely have a stack of Googlecoins they mined at home before it became too difficult to do so...

First and foremost, I believe they're looking to augment their own New York MSB requirements with ones meant specifically for bitcoin businesses -- what they're tentatively calling "BitLicenses."
Nobody really knows how broad they'll make those regulations, or exactly how many different types of businesses would be affected; but, at minimum, and at their core, my guess is that they will very much resemble many of the same regulations that apply to MSBs today.
Their chairman seems like he's willing to listen and encourage both entrepreneurship and innovation, so I'm optimistic right now that their regulations will, at least initially, be fairly modern and flexible.
If all goes well, bitcoin-related businesses will flock to New York and begin thriving there.  If that happens, I expect similar bitcoin-specific regulations to pop up all over the country.
Fingers are crossed...

Actually, they do already offer a hot wallet app on Android.  I haven't tested it yet, but it seems to have all of the basic functionality you'd want in a simple wallet app if you want to pay with bitcoin directly.
The problem, though, is that it also has all of the usual security concerns that usually come with a hot wallet app -- which is why the credit card wallet concept would be slightly interesting if they don't ruin it with fees.
Then again, the credit card wallets also probably inherit all of the old CC problems that we're trying to get away from... merchant fees, personal information, etc  :(

The only problem with the idea of them "settling" so low is that would mean they're not actually being used very much at all; because, given their scarcity, $8 Billion isn't nearly enough total investment to indicate such usefulness.
Ultimately, IF they do prove exceptionally useful, that market cap would increase dramatically, and therefore their individual value would have to skyrocket, as well.
That's why the only real answer is: $0 or tens/hundreds of thousands of dollars each.  Anything in the low hundreds of dollars, even if it's stable, means that it's stuck on the fringe and not used very much at all...

Alternate theory: they're nervous because they're less sure of themselves than they were two years ago, and they're actually running out of legitimate ways to criticize Bitcoin.

A kickback scam is a form of embezzlement that involves making arrangements with the recipients of a contract to give you back a portion of the money they are paid for said contract. This effectively hides the trail of the  money.
Example: the owner of a forum pays a few high school friends several hundred thousand dollars in Bitcoin to pretend to build a new piece of forum software. After sending them the money, they wait X amount of time and then send all or most of the money back to the forum operator using private bank wires. In essence, they have "kicked the money back" to the original sender and none of the original donors will ever know that he pocketed most of it instead of using it for its intended purpose.
Nepotism, on the other hand, is simply giving preferential treatment to friends or family -- most often used when describing business arrangements.

Good luck modifying every wallet software and service in the world to take the currently non-existent "fee market" into consideration for EVERY transaction.
I hate the plan you just suggested because, even if a viable fee market is invented, your plan involves actually *destroying* said market when the block size is still increased at a later date.
Seriously, none of that makes as much sense as simply raising the limit now, and then focusing all efforts on alternative solutions to relieve the pressure in the years to come (LN, sidechains, payment channel solutions, etc).

_Coinsetter_:  Currently in beta, looks promising. However, you might want to read this from their FAQ:
*"Due to regulatory reasons, bank deposits and withdrawals are only available to customers residing outside of the United States at this time. However, you still have the ability to trade on our platform by making bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. We are working hard to offer bank transfer options to you soon. If you are based outside of the US, you definitely have the option of depositing USD into your account using a SWIFT Wire Transfer.  
For those located within the US, we are currently working to achieve all the proper licensing before we allow US customers to deposit USD. In the meantime, if you deposit BTC into your account, you can trade that BTC for USD. We plan on opening up our platform in the next few months to give US customers the option of depositing USD into their account. Hang tight and thank you for your patience."*﻿
_CampBX_:  definitely one of the better options if you don't mind using money orders or Western Union , but their recent banking issues are extremely disconcerting.  *"Unfortunately wire transfer deposits are temporarily unavailable."*

They don't necessarily balance out.  
Hypothetically, say you have 5 parties interested in 30k coins each.  That's a maximum total demand for 150k coins.
The winning bidders only subtract a maximum of 30k coins from that total demand, thus leaving 120k coins in residual demand.
Of course, the numbers I'm using are all made up, but I think you should get the idea.
It's certainly mathematically possible that the total demand from every bidder could total just 30k, exactly, but it's not very probable. (ie. 10 bidders for just 3k each)
Edit 2: downvoting math?  O.o
Edit: this is assuming that all blocks are bid on, and at least one party bids on more than one block, OR that the total number of bidders is greater than 10.

Late January.  I had transferred my coins back there just to dump to fiat for the Chinese New year.  When I started seeing withdrawals get stuck, I bought back in for a loss and tried to get out.
My two withdrawals were stuck for five days, but they manually pushed them both out after I pestered them in IRC that whole time.  Just a few days later, they turned off withdrawals completely.
I had a front row seat to the beginning of this mess... it was ugly, crazy, scary.

I should have added the word "vulnerable" to the list.  In this case, the wallet or mining software itself would have to be vulnerable; and, more specifically, the portion of the code that handles these data files.
In that regard, only two things need to happen:  1) all of the non-SPV wallet projects that deal with the entire blockchain should use the reference code for that function, and 2) only download said software from trusted sources, check the md5 hashes, and/or compile the code yourself.
Again, though, this requires an executable (the wallet or mining  software) -- the data files can't execute anything on their own.

Those numbers are simply meant to demonstrate the **concept** of incentives for both retailers and consumers. They're obviously not real.
That said, the hashing power of all chipped devices, combined, generates coins for 21 Inc, not individual consumers.
In return, 21 Inc will provide consumers with just enough Satoshis (dust) to support the Bitcoin-based apps they're running on those devices (secure authentication transactions, etc. 
On top of those satoshis, they'll provide additional incentives in the form of retail discounts, expedited services, etc. They'll subsidize those discounts and other incentives by sharing some of their coin proceeds with the participating companies.
In order for all of the above to work, and your everyone to be happy hashing for them, they'll have to get the incentives just right for everyone in the entire loop.
Without the incentive mechanisms for retailers and consumers alike, the entire plan would fail. The leadership at 21 Inc is not stupid.  They know that they need to nail the incentives for everyone involved.
Make more sense now?

Been pretty good about it so far.  There are times when I'll wait hours to buy an item just to time it right.  If it goes up, I'll probably just replace the coin anyway, or perhaps wait for it to drop again.

Actually, you're exactly right.  If the alternate theory in this article is correct, then using those fields to inject exploit code is what they would have done to expose the IP.  However, they can't admit to doing that without opening the door to questions of the legality of using said exploits without a warrant.
So, in order to avoid admitting to the use of exploit code, they are claiming that they simply typed a bunch of random characters into those login fields to cause the error and expose the IP.  
The defending attorneys should demand a full log of the characters they supposedly typed into the login fields.

I think the OP is alleging that treechains would allow for whole unencrypted files to be attached to transactions and added to their chains, therefore distributing said files to anyone and everyone running a node of that chain.
That's very different than 100 encoded messages sent across Twitter, since there's no easy way to remove previous transactions from a chain (unless they eventually get pruned out).
I could be wrong, though?

Not quite.  The problem IS also an issue with the reference implementation itself.  Exchanges and others who run wallets with a large number of transactions were expected to code a simple workaround to mitigate the known issue.  The devs planned to address the core problem eventually, but it wasn't at the top of their list since most competent exchanges were able to code the simple workaround into their custom wallets.
The DDOS then revealed related issues within bitcoind, as well.

You're correct.  I should have been more clear -- operators only need to register as a MSB in the state where the machine is located.
However, every one of the 48 states (and D.C.) where that applies has different MSB requirements, and most of those require the reserve capital and insurance bonds I referred to. (New Mexico and South Carolina are the two exceptions, but they don't exactly have thriving markets in either of those areas)
The only reasons I didn't buy ten of these things are because of the ridiculous MSB requirements and Robocoin's ridiculous terms.
30% of my revenue the first year?  Increasing to as high as 50% the year after that?  Yeah, right... fuck off Robocoin.  I'll wait for someone to release a high quality bi-directional machine that doesn't require us to give them 1/3 to 1/2 of our revenue every month/year.  Machines that require 7% transaction fees just for the operator to come out ahead are simply unsustainable long-term.
Other expenses include:
1. Cash services for each machine (to load/unload cash every few days).
2. Physical security -- sometimes in the form of a full-time guard.
3. Fees imposed by the exchanges.
4. Annual MSB licensing
5. Monthly or annual insurance bond payments.
6. Tax attorneys and accountants.... annnnd TAXES!  (doh!)
7. Possible energy costs shared with the land owner (ie. the coffee shop owner)
8. Possible rent fees if the location owner doesn't see the increased foot traffic as a benefit (ie. Airports)
9. Cash reserves.  For example, to run a machine in New York, their MSB requirements include cash reserves of $300,000... PER MACHINE!   (yikes!)
Etc etc... now, subtract all of those from the revenue AFTER paying Robocoin their exorbitant cut.  Good luck!

Unlike you or I, businesses don't have they luxury of ignoring small transactions simply because of obscurity.
I also don't agree that "99% of coins" will come from those exchanges.  Social media and forum tips, mining, private trades, trades on online exchanges, donations, etc -- all of which will introduce "foreign" coins to the consumer wallets at those companies.  There's no chance in hell they'll be able to track the CGT obligations from all of those sources.
Hell, even moving coins from phone to laptop to cold storage, and back again, will introduce entropy that will make it almost impossible for wallet services to track CGT obligations for consumers.
The bottom line is that the IRS took the lazy way out.  Instead of creating and defining a brand new asset category, they are attempting to force crypto currencies into one of their old molds. 
It simply won't work.  Their attempt to force this into the "property" mold will either lead to a failure of the IRS, or a failure of widespread Bitcoin adoption itself in the U.S.
Part of me suspects that may even have been intentional...

LOL.. I've been doing this with all my purchases lately, but I take it a step farther:  I time both the item purchase and the bitcoin buyback using the consistent small swings in the market... this provides for a few more dollars off of every purchase. :)

The mining chips will provide the 21 Inc pool with hashing power (revenue). 
In exchange, 21 Inc will provide participating devices with enough dust satoshis to facilitate any/all Bitcoin-related apps on the device, as well as other incentives for participating members -- perhaps in the form of colored coins that can be used for discounts at partnered merchants and services, etc.
Seems pretty simple to me. *As long as the incentives outweigh any potential costs for the consumers*, everyone wins.

To a certain extent, yes; however, if the barrier to entry is too high, then it's that much harder to innovate, expand adoption, and therefore increase the market cap.
The only reason I haven't opened a US-based ATM business myself is because they've already made it next to impossible for me, as an entrepreneur, to afford it.
You literally need millions of dollars in reserve capital just to run a half dozen machines in most major cities. 
For example, the current MSB requirements in New York require you to have a $1 Million insurance bond and $300,000 in reserve cash PER MACHINE.
I also have very little faith in them removing those massive barriers to entry with their new "BitLicense" regulations...

What services and receiving country are you speaking of, specifically?  Bank transfers are generally pretty expensive and Western Union charges upwards of 15%, while Coinbase charges just 1% on the USD side of a bitcoin transaction.
I have a feeling that you'll see very innovative and cost effective exchanges popping up all over the second and third world soon, along with bitcoin ATMs and other means of covering BTC to fiat.
Most of the high costs of sending money using the traditional methods are due to the expensive (and very slow) back-end infrastructure required for the transfers.
With bitcoin, those back-end costs are essentially reduced to just the cost of the transmission fee (for the miners), which is usually around 0.0001 BTC these days (or close to it).
I'm very interested to know what bitcoin services you're referring to, specifically...?

When the number of their stuck TX peaked at 50,000+ a few weeks ago, the vast majority of them, as well as the broken resends, were broken due to "Outputs Already Spent."  
AFAIK, the only ones who were successful in finally getting our stuck TX out are those that they manually resent after 3 to 4 days. 
My two withdrawals were manually pushed just before they shut down withdrawals completely -- the first by Mark himself, and the second by neofur (sp?).
This is why I personally think that social engineering WAS required to pull off any theft, and that any potential thieves had to be amongst those of us hanging out in IRC begging for manual resends.
I could be wrong, though...

The "critical infrastructure" clause in paragraph two above is very interesting given the fact that many systems involved in the critical infrastructure are otherwise standard PCs and servers.  DHS and others also classify the entire .gov network as *critical infrastructure* (depending of which official you ask, or which policy document you reference).
So, I find it interesting that they didn't limit that exception to SCADA systems.

Serious question:  how much bitcoin would you be willing to store on such a device?  (Let's say you have 100 BTC to your name)
@_date: 2014-10-25 19:53:18
Wrong.  During his entire existence, Willy's purchases were never more than 20 Bitcoin each.
Willy purchased between 10-20 bitcoin every 5-10 minutes.  Both the amounts and the times had what looked like built-in randomization, but those limits I just listed were absolute. (The times and amounts could gave been something other than random, such as order book conditions, but nobody other than the creator really knows).
Again, you apparently don't know what you're talking about.
Not only did I discover and study Willy, I even confronted Mark about the bot on IRC in late January, and he denied all knowledge of its existence.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:20:02
They all know Mark.  They're friends.  So, all that probably means is that they knew his personal cell number to email or text him with things like "Hey Mark, my withdrawal TX is stuck again... can you please manually resend it?"  or "Mark, can you ensure my 4,000 BTC withdrawal gets pushed manually today?"
I accomplished the same thing by speaking directly to Mark on IRC in late January.

Kraken is a US-based exchange, and they're currently going through the process of getting licensed and registered in every state.

They can already do that with any modern online banking solution. Billions have been stolen from personal and business bank accounts during the last decade.

Sometimes, your levels of ignorance impress the hell out of me.
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:15:19


The floating fees code you're referring to does not account for many of the factors and conditions I listed above, and I don't believe it will be easy (or timely) to code them in.
Seriously, the entire "fee market" is going to be a complete trial-and-error mess for end users -- especially when compounded by the never-ending delays and other payment nightmares caused by full blocks.  


It will be **nothing** like it is today where the standard minimum fee is "good enough" most of the time --  **because the blocks aren't full yet, so there is little or no transaction competition to speak of!**  
The moment the blocks are consistently full and the tx fee competition takes off, it's going to be a total trial-and-error mess for end users when attempting to figure out what fee to add to every transaction.
You're going to need to know the current global volume, what other people are paying, current tx backlog, etc.
Which, of course, is and should be completely unacceptable to any average consumer just trying to buy something online.


I wholeheartedly agree that a phased or gradual increase is a better idea. My only contention is that **it's fucking idiotic to wait until after you've created a highly competitive fee market.**
These are only "strawman" arguments to you because you've got your fingers stuck in your ears and don't want to hear them. Either that, or you just don't care about adoption and what kind of experience average consumers have when they try to use Bitcoin. (See, I can make bullshit accusations too! Yay!)


It would be much easier for them to accept the change now -- before the advent of a competitive fee market -- than it will be after such a market develops and grows to maturity. 
In other words, making the change now would barely change the miners' behavior. Doing it later would be a total shock to the system, the fee market, and the miners' business strategies.


Did you know that running a decent Lightning Network node will be a few orders of magnitude more expensive than that, even?
Such is life. Large businesses will either decide to run nodes -- which would be a huge help to them anyways -- or the system will ultimately fail. Quit fighting that fact, and we'll all be better off.


So what? We won't have home nodes anymore? BFD.
Instead, we'll see the world's largest retailers and other corporations setting up their own full nodes to facilitate their own transaction distribution and security.
I (we) survived the whole transition from home mining to big corporate mining, so I don't really give a shit if the exact same thing happens to full nodes, as well. In fact, I think that's inevitable with Bitcoin.


I'd argue that a Bitcoin with random and extended tx delays, as well as high fees, would quickly become entirely useless for consumers.


It really hasn't. Not at all. We haven't seen anything that's even close to parabolic adoption... yet.
I find it interesting that you completely ignored my point that LN will require Bitcoin to have much larger blocks. Why is that?
@_date: 2014-09-18 01:58:56

I actually thought of doing this years ago with fiat -- something with the name "Props" or "CoolPoints" -- but, I never followed through.
Basically, you encourage "cool" content by making every LIKE a micro-tip of some sort (maybe even as much as 5 cents).  The users then simply upload content to earn their own money to tip with, or they top off their accounts on a regular basis with $5-$10 in fiat/bitcoin.
New users could even be given a small amount to start tipping with.

I found it very disturbing when the NYDFS filed their brief with the NY Labor Board claiming that there would be no measurable impact on startup companies and entrepreneurs in NY.  Normally, the regulating body is required to provide a thorough analysis to the Labor Board, but NYDFS claimed in their brief that they don't need to provide one due to their regs having no impact.  
The FOIL request by the BF may ultimately prove that no such analysis was ever done, or it may even reveal that one was done and subsequently ignored by the NYDFS because its conclusions are counter to their claim of "no impact."

This is absolutely true.  I have a friend who I previously considered a financial guru, with multiple Master's degrees and certs from the country's best business schools, but he adamantly refuses to admit that there are *any* benefits with crypto currencies -- especially Bitcoin.  He goes so far as to make fun of anyone "dumb enough" to think they're viable.  
It just goes to show that we've got a long and difficult battle ahead of us before the words "mainstream adoption" are actually accurate.

That's assuming the intended recipients give you the option to choose.

@_date: 2015-05-27 22:51:29
The problem with fees being the determining factor is that there is currently no tool or wallet mechanism to determine what fee is necessary to "compete" at any given moment, so every transaction would be reduced to trial and error.
Which, as you can imagine, would be completely unacceptable to just about everyone involved...

Pretty cool... but, I may still prefer onename.io for a very similar function.

Apple's cut comes from the 2-5% fee that the credit card processors are already charging merchants for every CC transaction.  Apple is taking their cut from the banks, not merchants or consumers directly.

Which one?  It does offer microSD backup on both devices, and I'm sure the hot wallet could also be tied to an online account of some sort.  That way, even if you lose it, you could get to another PC or mobile device to withdraw your coins before anyone who finds the wallet manages to crack your login password(s).
I imagine it could/should work the exact same way as losing any smart phone with a hot wallet.

I treat all the ladies I know "like people," including those who make a living using their appearance and bodies as an asset.
Have you ever asked a booth girl how she feels about being hired and paid a decent wage to look sexy and talk about a product?
I find it humorous that it's almost always non-booth girls, or girls who don't work at Hooters, who run around telling us how guilty we should feel for those ladies who do have those jobs.
I once had a VERY sexy girlfriend who worked at Hooters for over a decade after obtaining her Master's degree.  She absolutely loved it and the money she made was ridiculous!
Should I have questioned her sanity or self esteem?  I don't f'n think so.  She had more intelligence, confidence, and self esteem in her little finger than 99 percent of the women I've known in "more traditional" careers.
So, once again, why are you so insecure?  Better yet, why do you blame the booth ladies, or the men who hired them, for your own insecurities?

tl;dr - Jeremy Allaire spends two years calling for more regulations and courting the regulators, only to realize in the eleventh hour that they don't have his (or our) best interests at heart, and they never will.
The only reasonable response is to cut off New York from the bitcoin ecosystem.  It's only when New York residents and businesses themselves rise up to object, loudly, that there's any chance at all to effect change in their governance.
States like North Carolina, Texas, and California should listen and learn.  Each of them stands a very good chance of taking over as the finance capital of the U.S. if they do *the exact opposite* of New York.

That's the thing -- you **don't** "know full well." None of us do.
Nobody here is privy to their actual business plan and incentive structure. None of us.
So, claiming that you now better than 21 itself, or outright claiming that they're absolutely going to fail, is just plain fucking ignorant.
I'm not "preaching" anything. I'm attempting to explain how it's going to work based on what little we do know, as well as what I learned from an extended conversation I had yesterday with one of the engineers designing the new chips.

I agree with everything you wrote except your last point -- and then only if Allaire's vision of regulation comes to fruition.
The goal should be to wrest control from the central banks, not grant them new forms of it -- which is exactly what Allaire appears to be pushing for or predicting in his latest speech.

Unless, of course, you know what you or your "friends" placed as a bid.  The price between now and Monday is irrelevant to the outcome, so your job as a dumper is done.
This could work out either way.  If you know that the bids were at least 600, you can buy back in with that knowledge and without fear. If you suspect the coins sold cheaper than that because you or your "friends" bid very low, you could pump and then open a short ahead of that fact being leaked next week.
Again, though, the job of moving the price down to set up lower bidding is done, so you can buy back in without fear... and this all started at 650+.
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:23:59
Their data is still valuable in that it speaks to demand (in this case, irrespective of price).

1) I'm in the upper-middle class that has most of that burden.  
2) put simply:  the gap is bad because it leads to eternal and ever-increasing debt as more and more people become poor, eternal inflation, and therefore more and more people requiring government entitlements just to survive.
3) I specifically listed *income* taxes, for that reason.  The remaining taxes that you mention only serve to make the poor... even more poor.
4) "neither is happening"..."our debt is **beginning** to level off relative to our GDP" = which is it?  LOL derp.

If they integrate this with something like Circle, or a hundred different competing companies (banks) like Circle, then the users won't ever have to worry about the Bitcoin transactions constantly happening in the background.
In other words, the entire process of buying bitcoins and making payments would be invisible to the average users.
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:48:51
Yes, but that's only on the VERY small private company pre-IPO market that involves just 75 companies. 
They'll likely test single vs. aggregated transactions during this experiment -- and then they'll determine how they could scale up for the larger markets (if at all).
Since most of their larger markets close every evening, they could possibly aggregate entire days and then broadcast the settlements every night. They could do the same for after-hours trading.
Or, maybe aggregating and only broadcasting the settlements on the blockchain every four hours... or two hours... or every hour... etc etc.

@_date: 2014-04-03 00:13:10
Thanks for the link!  
I guess it's just a matter of figuring out what exact data is required for tax purposes, and then users can decide when and where to import that data.
Timestamps, price on a user-selected exchange or index, etc.  The tricky part will be figuring out all this nonsense when bitcoins are obtained off-chain or other sites/methods that don't already record some sort of standardized history (exchanges, tip bots, faucets, alt mining pools, etc) -- especially when the acquisition of coins involves hundreds or thousands of tiny fractions of coin.
I do understand that this only applies to U.S. users, but I'm sure we comprise a large enough portion of the user base to justify an effort to standardize and implement these *optional* functions throughout the ecosystem.
And yes, the IRS f'n sucks! :(

You can load coins directly onto your phone's storage using apps like Bitcoin Wallet on android.  As long as you have an internet data connection with that phone, you'll be able to spend bitcoin.  
In other words, you won't need to rely on a third party service or "the cloud" to spend your money.

I don't see any of the large holders doing anything at all to prevent the expansion of bitcoin into the developed world.  In fact, many of those holders are the ones who are building both non and for-profit companies to do exactly that.
I also don't see any of the large holders doing anything to control my life, restrict my freedoms, or confiscate my wealth -- all of which are characteristic of the old banking elite.
So, tell me again how/why you equate large bitcoin holders to the old established banking elite we're all trying to replace?  Do you honestly believe they're just laying in wait to take over the world with totalitarian vengeance and anger?

Had an interesting conversation with an engineer working on these chips who dropped by the whaleclub teamspeak server tonight.
He essentially said that the plan has much more to do with DAO's and autonomous devices than consumer electronics like phones and laptops. His examples included future cars, drones, and other devices that constantly communicate and negotiate micro payments for an infinite number of reasons. His advice was to stop thinking about it in terms of humans and profits, and start thinking about the many possibilities of devices communicating and negotiating things on their own.
In other words, these guys are laying the foundation for the future connectivity that exists 10-20 years from now, not just the small consumer electronics opportunities that may exist today.

Make what happen? I'm not making anything happen.
I'm explaining how 21 Inc will likely incentivize and subsidize participation in their mining pool.
People keep asking "why would anyone want to mine with their devices?"
The answer, of course, is that it's all about the incentives to do so. If 21 Inc can provide the right incentives to participating consumers and retailers alike, participation would become a no-brainer.
seriously, which part confuses you?

It appears that this is one of the new scams associated with the ridiculous "**Crypto Private Investor Group**" started recently by Garza and his other scammer friends.
The announcement for this ridiculous pre-sale, debit, and "revolving **credit**(!) card has since been deleted from Hashtalk, but the cache of that thread is here:  
  
Here's the comical (*as in, FUCKING HILARIOUS!!*) text of their original announcement at the link above:  


The intent of Crypto Private Investor Group is to facilitate and foster worldwide adoption of cryptocurrencies. **Per our website, picking up where GAW left off**.
With that in mind, the Crypto Private Investor Group is pleased to announce that we are far enough along in the development of what was intended to be the Paycoin Debit Card to begin taking reservations for CoinCard, the world’s first crypto CREDIT card, launching in July 2015. And yes, we said credit!
As already stated, CoinCard is what the Paycoin Debit Card was intended to be, but on steroids. Made more powerful in that it offers revolving credit for those that qualify while also serving as a debit card. With CoinCard, you can pay down your revolving balances using Paycoin or other cryptocurrencies or preload your CoinCard the same way…by using Paycoin, Bitcoin or any altcoin you prefer.
And what makes this offer even sweeter is that for a limited time, the first 1,000 crypto users that reserve their CoinCard will enjoy fee free transactions for one year! Yup, that’s right, fee transactions for one year!
CoinCard is accepted anywhere MasterCard® is accepted. In other words, it’s accepted globally at millions of locations, whether on- or off-line.
These will surely go fast. So reserve yours to day by visiting reservecoincard.com and be among the first to actually be able use your crypto!

The problem is that they could go around the devs and enforce some sort of draconian regulation that requires businesses in the U.S. to only accept transactions from "clean" or registered addresses.
While this would seemingly only affect the ecosystem in the U.S. -- at least initially -- it could ultimately destroy coin fungibility for everyone.  (Especially if they get other nations to sign treaties to adhere to the same regulation).
A move like this could, quite literally, destroy Bitcoin itself.
The idea needs to burn in hell.

Willy did not drive the rally. Willy was a very slow-moving accumulation bot that, while possibly having some immeasurable psychological impact on the market by remaining consistent in its small purchases, paled in comparison to the obscene volume in China -- and even paled in comparison to the other very large traders on Gox itself. 
Willy rarely moved the spread up by more than a penny or two, while hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of other coins were often traded in the 5 to 10 minutes between Willy's relatively tiny purchases.
The Chinese exchanges drove both the 2013 rally and the subsequent crash. Period.

I was referring to a possible way that each node could prove its storage drive is unique to the network (thus preventing multiple nodes pointing to the same drive).  I'm just not sure if there's anything unique to every hard drive or partition that could be hashed and used as a unique identifier.  Are you aware of anything unique to every hard drive or partition besides a hash of the entire drive itself?
Perhaps that's the only way to do it:  after any file is added to a storage location, the node must hash the entire drive again and present that hash to the storj network as the unique identifier of that specific storage device...?

Granted, they'll need to find a host for their OpenBazaar site, and they'll also need to figure out the shipping logistics from their local towns, so there's still some hurdles to overcome.

Actually, the issue with BitLicense is that it DOES apply to some software updates and innovations that will now require explicit approval from the NYDFS Superintendent himself.
Specific examples that I've seen discussed include multisig wallets like the Coinbase Vault and Bitpay's CoPay multisig system.
Implementation/integration of any of the new BIPS will likely require pre-approval, as well.
As you should well know, these are/were essentially just extensions of their software to enhance their existing offerings; however, if they tried to release the same new software capabilities with BitLicense in effect, each of those would now require Lawksy's explicit approval prior to release -- which can obviously be VERY detrimental to any business suffering through the approval process while overseas competitors can beat you to market.
I've seen all of the above mentioned as specific examples by some of the leaders in this space who have been directly engaging NYDFS during this entire process.
So yes, we ARE talking about seemingly benign software updates and enhancements here, and not just the invention or addition of entirely new financial instruments.
Edit: rearranged paragraphs for clarity.

All currencies are "wealth transfer schemes." That's pretty much the point.

Nobody who actually understands Bitcoin believes that bitcoins will magically "turn themselves into wealth."

Labor is necessary to create and sustain their utility; but, their scarcity is fixed, and their velocity will occur naturally as a result of the other two factors.

The average full time salary for a senior developer is approximately $140,000/yr, but Theymos' buddies are making almost 30% more than that every year.

Actually, the first 178,000 BIT shares were issued/purchased for just $12.67 each on September 25, 2013. There have been many other times since then when the BIT NAV price was lower than the current GBTC bids, as well.
Many current BIT holders could actually get a very good return if they sold now for the bid prices we're seeing.
Never assume.
So, why aren't they selling? My guess is that that it's a combination of logistics and a desire by some of them to see them go for even higher even if they'd still profit by selling now.

Historically speaking, the alts I named above aren't very risky since they have almost always risen and fallen in parallel with BTC -- unless, of course, you believe BTC will never rise again?
This entire market is risky; but, it's a well known fact that greater risk often comes with greater reward.
Other popular alts, such as Doge and Maxcoin, don't rise and fall in parallel with BTC.  For that reason, those are the types of alts that I would classify as more risky.  Then again, Doge has made many people VERY wealthy, so you never know...

What would be the the purpose of running their own private nodes for their own private chain instead of running a much more efficient database?
You're not making any sense.
Blockchains are only powerful and necessary when two or more parties don't trust one another, and thus they need a "trustless" settlement/ledger mechanism to keep them honest.
I can't think of any good reason for a single company to run its own internal blockchain instead of a database. Do they not trust themselves?  Does their marketing department not trust their engineering department, or vice versa?  
Seriously, why would they need a trustless settlement mechanism?

You could actually sell that much on the major exchanges today with less than $2 slippage from spot price (plus fees).
Alternatively, if you took your time, you could probably sell it in smaller chunks using actual ask orders and avoid the fees and slippage.
1500 really isn't all that much on exchanges like bitfinex.
You could also sell them all at once OTC for a slightly larger fee.
All of the above are easy to do once you take the time to get set up on the exchanges or with a private OTC broker.

I don't know about you, but I charge my phone every night regardless of how it's used every day, so there's no new measurable electricity cost if you're still just charging it at night.
That's also why I said it all depends on how much faster it drains your battery. If the added burn is negligible, and your still only need to charge it at night, then there's no added cost to the user.
Here's a thought: what if the devices include a separate battery just for this chip?

I disagree.  I think we should stick with mBTC, call them "millies," and be done with it.
At the current price, that essentially doubles the listed USD price for any item.  $5 = 10 millies, $20 = 40 millies, etc.
If/when btc doubles again, the conversion from dollars (or euros) to millies would be close to 1:1.
Why jump straight to something (µBTC) that requires so many zeros?  I know some parts of the world are used to that, but the West certainly isn't...

Personally, I wouldn't describe XCP as a "currency."  In this case, it's more of a token that can represent another asset of your choosing.  (Something akin to a stock certificate or deed). Unlike bitcoin, it's very unlikely that anyone will ever buy normal goods or services with XCP.  It's certainly possible, but still very unlikely.
I consider alt coins that leverage bitcoin's blockchain to be very different from other alt coins that use completely separate custom blockchains of their own.
Edit: I know that CP themselves describe it as a currency; but, based on the above, I don't really agree.  Make sense?

Ferrari itself may actually require you to own a used one before they're willing to sell you a new one. 
I know Lamborghini has that requirement.
A friend of mine worked at a Lambo dealership and told me that new buyers would buy a used one and leave it at the dealership for resale just so that they could immediately turn around and buy a brand new one that they would take home.
I'm not really sure if Ferrari does the same, though. I haven't tried to buy one... yet. ;)

That said, I don't have an opinion on how well a land-based tax system would work. It's certainly an interesting concept, though.

While you make some very good points regarding Balaji's character, here's the concern:  
If 21 Inc successfully integrates their new chips into millions (or even billions) of devices, and those chips are all **hard-coded to only hash for 21 Inc's mining pool**, then we will certainly have a rather large problem with 21's centralized control of all that mining power.
Or, do you honestly think that they'll let users decide where to direct the BitSplit hashing power? How/why would they do that when said hashing power comprises the vast majority (if not *all*) of their projected revenue?
I fear that won't be the case. They won't likely leave that choice up to users; and, if they're successful, they *will* end up with a TON of influence over the future of the protocol itself... perhaps *too much* influence.

By the time enlisted soldiers hit the rank of E7, an exceptionally large percentage have earned bachelor's degrees, and many even go on to get Master's degrees, as well.

Why? One reason: Because, it would make it MUCH easier to finally create a **fully decentralized** USD/BTC exchange!
Think about it. If your bank allowed you to withdraw FedCoins, it would fully legitimize the technology for all the world to see, and your paychecks could then be converted to BTC (or any other crypto) without the current messy fiat+bank transfer part of the problem.

SegWit has something called the *discount rate*. That rate, currently set at 75%, can can actually be "throttled" linearly to limit the effective capacity increase provided by SegWit. (For example, a setting of 0% would negate the entire SW effective capacity increase while still providing all of SW's other benefits).
Doing that, in conjunction with a similar throttle applied to the 2MB max_block_size setting, could prevent the blocks from growing too quickly. In fact, they could both be controlled simultaneously to provide a very smooth increase that takes years to reach the theoretical maximum of both combined.
The solution, as always, relies on smart planning and smart engineering. ;)

The collective device hashing power is for 21 Inc, not the users. The real question is "how much hashing power can 21 Inc. get, collectively, from five million devices? How about 50 million devices?" etc.

Your optimism is slightly encouraging, but I'm not sure I agree that it will all happen smoothly or without some consumers and businesses being made examples of.
And then there's the impact this will have on miners:  if they're to treat their earned coins as income at the time of receipt, what are the CGT and income tax obligations if they hold onto it for a day, or longer?  What happens if the value of their coins drops after they earn it as income?  You cannot write off capital losses against normal income, so they're essentially screwed, as well.
If they mine a coin and receive it when it's worth $1,000, that's considered $1,000 of normal taxable income.  What happens if the price drops to $500 the next day?  They now have an income tax obligation on $1k and a capital loss of $500.  There's currently nowhere on the 1040 to put that loss, and it's not even a realized loss unless they sell that coin during the same calendar year!
As a result, it's quite possible that you have income tax obligations on amounts MUCH larger than the December 31st value of your actual income for any given year!
Imagine those who are mining during the big spikes (like November-December 2013).  They would probably be better off NOT having mined during those months now that the value of that income is half what it was at the time!  They now supposedly owe income taxes on coins that were worth more than $1k at the time!
The ways in which these new IRS guidelines essentially break the entire U.S. bitcoin ecosystem are almost too numerous to count or predict... I'm not optimistic at all. :(

None of which are sufficient replacements for an actual CISO. Too many developers and engineers wrongly assume they can just "do all the security stuff."

The what?! O.o
I think it's quite obvious that most of our sexual obsession with breasts, specifically, was manufactured by centuries of shame and guilt inspired by the various churches.  We've been taught to treat them as sexual, and shamed by puritanism into covering them up for that reason.  Then, once it became "normal" to keep them covered, the mere fact that they're always covered increased the perception that they're sexual.
There's a reason that "modern" tribal societies don't walk around with raging hard-ons all day even though the women in their villages expose their breasts 24/7.  Men aren't walking around everywhere in Africa saying "omgBooBZ!"
That's because the breasts are seen by those groups of men as functional, not sexual, and no church has "programmed" them to believe otherwise... yet.

Simply put: The decentralized miners won't continue to facilitate "worthless trucks," so the Bitcoin network itself would cease to exist.
You're falling to understand that the incentive aspects of the system are what have made Bitcoin what it is today. Without such built-in financial incentives, miners would not stick around to operate and secure the network.
TLDR: Bitcoin isn't Bitcoin without bitcoin. The fact bitcoins themselves have value is the very reason they can transport value.

He said it, so it must be true...
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:22:59
Sorry, but that's simply not true. In order for Bitcoin to truly support international remittance, very large b2b payments, and other aspects of global commerce, their value must scale to match the value of said commerce.
Global transfers of millions, billions, or trillions simply aren't possible if the unit of transfer doesn't represent that same amount. In order to represent that amount, and for entities to have enough coins to make such transfers, one bitcoin *must* be worth much more than $100... a hell of a lot more, in fact.
21 million coins at $100 each could only facilitate a total of $2.1 Billion in transfers, and that's only the theoretical max based on one entity possessing every coin in existence. Considering that more money than that changes hands every few minutes around the world, the number of available coins at any time could simply never keep up.
That amount is practically worthless (or useless) in the global economy. Total world commerce is estimated at $78 Trillion every year. Even just 1% of global commerce would require $780 Billion in transfers... good luck trying to handle that amount of commerce with $100 bitcoins!
This is why most analysts agree that bitcoin will either go close to zero OR "to the moon." It will either die on the vine OR become part of the backbone of global commerce.
The question everyone needs to ask themselves is if they're willing to see this through to either of those two outcomes. In either case, the ride will be (and has been) unlike any other tradeable asset in the history of the world.
But, for the last time, a $100 bitcoin would essentially mean total failure. Such coins could NOT facilitate trade of any sort on a global scale, so it may as well be $0 at that point.

Incorrect.  It was a well known bug that most exchanges were able to fix on their end by coding a proper workaround.  Unfortunately, some exchanges, like Gox, ignored the issue and were too lazy to implement the workaround.  
As a result, they (Gox) probably lost a ton of money over the last few weeks when someone decided to exploit their lack of said workaround.
Fortunately, for everyone else, any potential theft required some social engineering combined with ignorant technical support staff, so other exchanges probably didn't lose any money at all.
And then the DDOS happened, which leverages the same bug by flooding the blockchain with modified transaction IDs.  While the DDOS shouldn't result in any lost coins, it was enough to confuse or trip up many of the wallets out there.

Let's play a game. 
How would you determine the fee for a tx if all the blocks are consistently full, there's an average 80 hour backlog for tx that have the "standard minimum fee," and you absolutely must pay a merchant right now for the dinner you just ate?  
What factors would you use to determine the absolute minimum fee you could pay to ensure your tx is included in the next block?
Dramatically over-paying is not allowed in this game. You must determine the **minimum** payment to get your tx in the very next block.

You're correct that it's no secret, and that theft (intentionally double-spending to commit fraud) has always been possible.

Coinbase has more than one choice to make right now, and one of those choices is whether or not to press charges against Peter.

Assets other than fiat? Yes.  However, Bitcoin itself replaces fiat when fiat is the object of transfer.  What you're describing is essentially an IOU system for fiat -- in which case, it would be kinda silly to use bitcoin itself as the mode of transport while attempting to have it represent a higher amount of fiat. Bitcoin itself has value, so why add to the complexity simply to present an artificial value above and beyond that base value? X number of bitcoins = Y fiat.  
You're describing Stellar or Ripple -- rails meant to transport what are essentially IOUs for any currency -- and neither of those works like Bitcoin. It would be inefficient to build those on top of Bitcoin, which is why neither of them did do. Bitcoins, as a currency, can ride on top of Stellar or Ripple, not the other way around.
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:42:20

"Those software updates" are my entire damn point.


Once again, I'm NOT talking about new financial instruments, and the BitLicense approval process itself is NOT limited to just new financial instruments.
In its current (and potentially final) form, the regulation stipulates that ALL OF THE ABOVE must be delayed until the superintendent himselfs approves each product change -- to include the implementation of new BIPS, new wallet structures and key protection schemes, new financial instruments, new trading engines, new connections to other services, new connections to other currencies... EVERYTHING!


Nobody needs to "think with Lawsky's head" because the leaders in this industry that I speak to on a regular basis -- the "interested parties" you mentioned -- have been directly engaging Lawsky during the entire process. They've written to him, met with him, briefed him, and continuously tried to reason with him; and yet, after all of the hearings, private letters, private meetings, and months of public comments, *the pre-approval requirements described above HAVE NOT BEEN LIMITED AT ALL in the the regulations!*

Who said anything about all of the transactions being directly on the Bitcoin blockchain itself?
I'm guessing that their solution involves something similar to the hub/spoke model or Lightning Network... Or, perhaps even sidechains if Blockstream ever makes that happen for them.

Perfect is the enemy of good.
A 2MB hard fork + SegWit, each with appropriate throttles, is a fantastic solution for the short term while we all spend another year planning a second hard fork to install a more permanent dynamic cap solution.
With SegWit, you can control its multiplying effect using a linear discount increase.
With the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE variable, you can do the same using 10% linear growth every X blocks until you reach 2MB.
Combined, you could very easily control the  growth rate **for two years** while you work on all of the other projects you've got in the pipeline.
Bonus: this solution even allows for a proper hard fork version of SegWit.
I, for one, believe there's still time for a compromise, and I'd love to keep Core on the job (in addition to Classic).
It's time to reevaluate the risks and for both teams to act accordingly.
It's time to work together.
@_date: 2016-01-19 08:23:40
They'd upgrade in order to process SW transactions. With a soft fork version of SegWit, non-upgraded nodes are essentially reduced to SPV status.
@_date: 2016-03-08 01:02:07
I don't think you understand how open source development works. Why should Classic develop their own version of SegWit if the original version will be released for everyone in the world to use in just a month or two?

No. I would have released a RFP and awarded the contract to the entity best suited to the task at hand based on a thorough assessment of the proposals. I then would have held them to a series of delivery milestones to ensure proper delivery of a fully functional product, within a known time frame, and that matched the initial expectations spelled out clearly in the RFP and subsequent SOW.
The entire process would have been transparent and fair to all parties.

Initially increasing the block size to 20MB next March, and then again +40% each year after that. That's what we'd see with BitcoinXT.
At the same time, the off-chain solutions will be given the time they need to be brought to market -- most of which may take a couple of years to be ready, including both LN and sidechains.
I'd call that a decent plan to scale Bitcoin.
Do you have an alternative proposal  that includes such specifics?

While I appreciate the thoughtful write-up gmax, and I'm sure it will benefit some readers here, I already understand all of that quite well.
In fact, farther down in the comments, I discussed the need to hand out control of the nodes to other individuals or organizations so that they're not under the charity's central ownership and control after they're bought and paid for.
It could be as simple as providing small business owners with a free Bitseed box and the funds to operate it for X months. 
The decentralization step of this charity node idea does still need some work, but I've certainly given it some thought.
If you have any ideas on how it could be better handled to the benefit of everyone and everything involved, I'd definitely love to hear them!
Remember, my primary goal with this idea is to figure out a way to make sponsoring full nodes a tax deduction (through donations) for individuals who don't want to mess with running one themselves.

The requested software update would be meant to remove the device erase feature, and allow for more pin code attempts per second via USB connection, not break the actual encryption of the device itself.
While the update would pretty much defeat the *point* of the encryption on the device, it wouldn't actually break the encryption itself.
That's a nuance of this particular case that not many commenters and media are grasping. The whole encryption/key thing is actually a separate issue/debate.

You assumed wrong. They have an interest in **understanding* Bitcoin and other crypto currencies from a strategic/threat perspective -- which is to be expected with any new technology that may cause or be relevant to disruption of any sort.

Regarding your last point, 21 will absolutely keep the majority of the mining profits for themselves. In fact, I suspect that will be their primary source of revenue.

You seem to be missing the point that the network of Bitcoin miners secures the transactions and legitimacy of the ledger itself.  Without the decentralized mining, there is no trustworthy network or security. 
For that reason, there's simply no way for a centralized solution to overcome the need for that security, note can they overcome the need for reliance on the old banking system, so a truly working and trustworthy system requires decentralized miners. 
Good luck convincing miners to switch to those centralized coins while other decentralized coins are more secure, and therefore more valuable.

One of the biggest problems Bitcoin has at the moment is a lack of liquidity in the markets. There are actually WAYYYY too many exchanges right now, so the order books are extremely thin across all of them.
A service like this will accomplish many things, including:  
1. Reduction of spread across exchanges.  
2. Has the effect of pooled liquidity.  
3. Single sign-on and single regulated service that provides the comfort level necessary for Wall Street to participate.  
4. Easier to run much more powerful trading bots.  
All of the above factors work to reduce volatility, enhance price discovery, and streamline access to the markets for accredited traders and trading houses.
Don't worry, though, you'll still have the ability to participate in the exchanges of your choice as an individual -- just don't be surprised when the bigger/better traders and bots using AlphaPoint consistently eat your lunch! lol

You do realize that every time you use a credit or debit card means you are handing over your full identity AND full access to your account, right? Every. Single. Time.

With Bitcoin, you only give them the money you want them to have, they don't get your identity and your account info, and they don't have any power to take extra then or in the future -- this is called a PUSH transaction. They only get the money you *push* to them, nothing else.
That privacy and security are two of Bitcoin's greatest benefits.

My biggest concern is that they fully expect every bitcoin exchange and hosted wallet service **in the entire world** to be compliant with these regulations, or be forced to identify and deny service to all NY residents and businesses.
(As it was with offshore gambling sites and all U.S. residents)
Now, extrapolate that out to 50 different states with 50 different nuanced regulations.  How the hell is any exchange going to remain compliant with all of those?  
What we're left with is even worse than what we have now.  As it stands, U.S. exchanges like Kraken have been limited to just a few states because they have to meet the MSB requirements for each of these states one at a time (think 50 different insurance bond requirements, 50 different reporting requirements, etc).
Now, every exchange or hosted wallet in the world will have to somehow be compliant with the nuanced regulations in all 50 states, or they too will only be able to provide service to residents in a few select states.
Even simple and elegant services like changetip will be forced to identify and deny service to individual states' residents, or risk prosecution since they likely can't afford to become fully NYDFS compliant (along with the costs for every other individual state).

the device's hashing power contributes to 21's mining pool in order to generate the majority of 21's revenue.  
I do have some serious concerns about the centralized nature of their mining pool if they don't let you reconfigure your devices up point elsewhere. However, I suspect they'll let you change those settings, and then use colored coins to keep you pointed in their direction (the Bitcoin equivalent of loyalty points and frequent flyer miles).

In other words, they made certain personal promises to the miners while knowing all along that they can later point to that fact to excuse a lack of progress on the fork.

Hey there old friend! Not sure I have the energy for this again (lol!), but I'll reach out to the OP with a brief summary of my analysis.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:50:40
You clearly don't understand how and why Bitcoin works, nor do you understand how remittance systems like Western Union work.
Western Union does not operate in a closed system. Instead, they transfer money around the world using the exact same transfer systems that banks use to transfer money -- so, they also suffer from all the delays, costs, and other problems inherent to those systems.
When someone receives money from a WU office, that office is essentially handing out the cash without actually having first received the real money in a transfer.  They are trusting the sending WU office to enter in the proper amount in the centralized WU database, and that the real money itself will arrive through normal banking channels within X number of days so that they can balance their own books. In other words, they are just using IOUs between the two WU offices involved in the transaction. Creating their own coin would do nothing to alleviate that problem.
They won't ever create their own centralized cryptocurrency because doing so provides them with no real benefits over the database system they currently use. Why? Because they'd still need to rely on banks to transfer fiat money between their offices "the old fashioned way" behind the scenes.
For obvious reasons, a  decentralized network like Bitcoin doesn't need to worry about that because the network doesn't rely on the old banking systems to transfer the money after the fact. It is a completely self-reliant system to transfer value or the ownership of other assets.
And you're comment about them getting one guy to mine for them and oversee everything is just too f'n stupid to even address...

The reports written about him after the fact are wrong. Other than VERY SLOWLY reducing supply over the course of months, Willy did not have any other significant impact on the price during the November 
2013 rally.
Hundreds of millions of new CNY caused and led that entire rally. Every day. Period.

@_date: 2016-03-08 03:19:37
Yeah, it would definitely require something that works with sha256 POW, or the entire bottom would fall out of this thing. 
It wouldn't necessarily require the splitting of existing frees, though. It could be an additional fee of some sort -- such as those the Lightning Network nodes will require.
Although, I guess the effect on the overall fee market(s) would still be the same -- since some might rightfully argue that LN is forcing a fee split, of sorts.
@_date: 2016-03-15 12:51:45
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:49:41

@_date: 2016-01-09 02:44:40


Do you even realize just how few people agree with that statement, even amongst the Core devs?
You know damn well that the Lightning Network will *never scale* with blocks as small as they are; and that, without space magic, a hard fork to increase the size is absolutely inevitable.
The *only* remaining question is this: **what do we gain from delaying the inevitable?**
@_date: 2016-01-06 02:42:07


No, it doesn't.
The network's current gross overhead costs are estimated to be between $450k to $750k per day.
The miners earn ~$1.5M per day (not including fees) in block rewards. From that total, they cover the previously mentioned overhead costs and are left with between $750k to $1M in net profits -- either realized or unrealized depending on whether or not they sell or hodl.
You're the second clown in two days to mistakenly claim a "cost" if $1.5 Million, and you're also completely full of shit with regards to "cost per transaction." Is there some new buttcoin talking-points memo out there that we don't know about? O.o
You want to know who/what covers the overhead cost of each transaction every day? 
Answer: The network itself currently does so with the block rewards.

Caveat: "opt-in" only remains opt-in if we never exceed blockspace capacity. If we do, then it almost instantly becomes mandatory for most transactions.

Isn't another tx required every time you add additional funding (bitcoin) to a channel?  I don't know about you, but I tend to add fresh funds to my bank accounts almost every week -- especially my debit/checking-type accounts used for miscellaneous spending.
I do a similar thing with the Bitcoin wallet on my phone every few weeks -- I reload it with just a little bit of "spending money."
Why would a LN wallet used for miscellaneous small purchases be any different? What am I missing?

That's a business decision -- and one that Full RBF doesn't actually solve completely.
FSS RBF is/was the only reasonable option, but f'n PT pretty much nuked it before it ever had a chance. The irony is that he supports complex solutions like SegWit, but not things like FSS RBF where his only argument against it was "it's too complex"...

You actually described what I meant by saying that 100 became 190. I believe the changes they're making will require them to never get above 100 -- meaning the loans outstanding are subtracted from their hard deposits, and then only re-added again once the loan is repaid. 
In this way, they only ever grow the loanable amount using their profits and new hard deposits, and they never create money where there was none before.
Does that make more sense?

How is their location relevant?
The concept of centralization in Bitcoin normally refers to node diversity, and mining pools function on the network as a single node -- or just a couple -- regardless of the number of miners pointing to them, or the physical locations of said miners.
In fact, if 21's hashing power grows exceptionally large, a system like 21's may result in a MORE centralized network, not less.
@_date: 2016-01-05 05:15:36
Why not? I'm trading cash for Bitcoin, or vice versa, so why not peg the fee to the cash side of the exchange? Why not peg the fees to an amount that is competitive and comparable to normal ATMs? Why must fees be based on percentages, rather than fixed to the much less volatile side of the exchange?
Don't try to tell me how it works. I know quite well how it all works, and NOTHING justifies percentage-based fees that are often North of 8%. 
Just as it is with any regular ATM, I might be willing to pay a fixed $5-10; but, there's no chance in hell I'm paying a $30-$40 fee to deposit or withdraw $500 worth of bitcoin when I can do the same amount at a regular ATM for a fixed $3.50 plus $5.00 (1%) at Coinbase. Seriously, fuck that.
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:29:27
The Bitcoin system requires 100% of miners to truly screw someone. If I can submit my otherwise valid tx to the 10% who aren't out to screw me, and they mine it in a block, then the rest of the network nodes will accept it as valid. The 90% who tried to screw me would have to create a fork that ignores that other 10% of miners completely in order to actually screw me, specifically.
That's also irrelevant given the subject of this discussion: without POW, how is the consensus determined in your private magical database? Good old fashioned access controls for those entities with consensus authority? Yep.
Congrats, you've "invented" federated event-driven databases with centralized access controls, as well as multi-signature notary services -- neither of which is new or profound.  
There are already other ways to create pseudo-immutable databases using only CR structures, and sharing CONTROLLED write access to those structures isn't exactly difficult.

Geography is only one aspect of centralization, and it's NOT what most are referring to when discussing the centralization of Bitcoin's network.


How other pools work is irrelevant given what we know about the 21 devices at this time -- which is the fact that they only work with 21's unique pool and coin distribution mechanisms.


21 has claimed in the past that they hope to decentralize their pool and coin distribution models in the future, but we've seen nothing to indicate that they're actually doing so anytime soon. In fact, I don't think they've figured out how to make that work yet.


Do YOU understand just how many devices they hope to install their chips in?
I believe their ultimate goal is many tens or hundreds of BILLIONS -- as in, the entire future IoT.

Coordinated SW now, with 0% discount, and 2MB hard fork in July.
That's called compromise. All the other benefits of SegWit, and a fixed 2MB for 2016. You can then increase the SegWit discount with soft forks later to scale up over the next couple of years.
It's either that, or we suffer through an UNcoordinated hard fork.
I'll take the former.
@_date: 2016-01-03 23:21:48

I'm usually not conceited at all, but I'm getting seriously pissed at people attacking me as though this business plan is my own. 
All I'm trying to do is explain the basics of the plan to people who don't understand it yet -- which is clearly A LOT of people.
Oh, and the reason it's happening? The network of tomorrow will involve more than a hundred billion devices communicating and transacting on the World Wide Ledger. THAT is why 21, Intel, Qualcomm, IBM, Samsung, and many many others are ALL planning to put secure hashing chips in every future machine they design and build from this point forward.
Those machines will need a highly secure and decentralized way to communicate and transact autonomously.
21 it's simply the first Bitcoin company we know about working to make all of the above possible at the hardware level.
Whatever their final incentive structure ends up being, the entire point of my OP was to explain that such incentives will exist and be the key yo consumer participation.

It wasn't a threat -- I'm personally in no position to do so. It's simply the truth of what will happen if Core refuses to implement a coordinated 2MB hard fork this year.

I'd much prefer a coordinated effort.
@_date: 2016-01-06 01:11:44
This is correct. It will likely take 18-24 months just to see full integration of SegWit throughout the entire system, and Lightning Network may take 2-4 years to mature... or longer.

No. Once again, the "internet" protocols have always been TCP and UDP.  Anything prior to that was not "the Internet."  The ARPANET and other early networks were all closed networks until the concept of "internetting" finally brought them all together using TCP and UDP.
The **Internet** protocols, specifically, did NOT change early on. Period.

Focusing on that misses most of the point of the OP, though -- especially since it's a known issue with several known fixes that the Classic devs are well aware of.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:52:35
Those two descriptions are not mutually exclusive.
ie. It could still be considered a 51% attack executed **as a result of** their rejection of the current development team.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:23:46
I believe they're correctly focusing entirely on the 2MB blocksize increase first and foremost. The rest of their program will develop after that.
In fact, I know this is the case because I'm now directly involved in their discussions/planning. ;)
@_date: 2016-01-19 08:31:41
There's a lot of support for it throughout the ENTIRE community, including miners. Even most Classic supporters would like to see SegWit implemented, as well, as it provides a ton of benefits above and beyond the effective capacity increase. For example, it also fixes transaction malleability; which, in turn, allows for the future Lightning Network integration.

@_date: 2016-01-17 17:15:23
Zero conf risk is something that is already being mitigated by most payment processors, as they've thoroughly assessed and assumed the risk to shield their merchants.
For those businesses that accept Bitcoin directly, a new form of zero-conf insurance company could be created to do the same (assume/cover the risk).

Mike is developing the social voting/consensus website that may or may not become the primary means by which the Bitcoin community voices their opinions (on everything).

You are probably correct, as the new sha256 majority chain would likely assume the name "Bitcoin" on any/all relevant exchanges.
It would be interesting to see what name "the community" would come up with if Core becomes the minority chain and subsequently changes the POW.
After all, "Bitcoin Classic" is taken.

It's only "opt-in" if we don't ever exceed blockspace capacity. If we do, then RBF essentially becomes mandatory for every tx.

How so? What variable in the LTC structure would cause centralization if they hit 28 tps using their current code? Bandwidth? Storage?
If you understand their tx and block structure, you'd realize that centralization isn't an issue for LTC unless/until they raise it to some indeterminate amount above and beyond their *existing* limits -- just like Bitcoin. The difference, of course, is that their current block and tx structures already allow for 28+ tps, whereas Bitcoin (without SegWit) is theoretically limited to 7 tps.

While related, I believe that's a separate issue (though still worthy of discussion). We're talking about third party payment processors that willingly assume the risk on behalf of their clients, not merchants that accept bitcoin directly.
Peter's demonstration was misdirected. Personally, I believe he should have chosen a willing merchant to demonstrate the issue.

I agree. In fact, I drafted a proposal for 2MB+SW almost a year ago and posted the summary here.

Any or all of the above. It would arrive in the form of an "altcoin" that eventually surpasses Bitcoin Core as the sha256-based coin of choice for miners and full nodes everywhere. It would utilize the existing/old Bitcoin blockchain as its own, and may even be called "Bitcoin" once Core is ultimately made obsolete or dies.

The other issue is that, once such surveillance measures are in place, we'd still need GDAX, Gemini, ItBit, and Kraken to collectively gain at least 10-25% of the total global trading volume.

That said, even without BU, I think these scaling issues will remain at the forefront of all discussions well into the future. It's simply not something that will just go away after SW activates (for the reason I described in the OP). There will always be some level of demand for more blockspace -- especially once more than one popular layer 2 solution begins competing for said space.

@_date: 2017-03-31 18:33:59
You guys really need to stop equating the new EC implementations to anything we've seen since the 1MB limit was installed.
BU completely removes blocksize from the tests done by the clients to reach consensus (establish block validity). This is an entirely new model that hasn't actually been seen since the 1MB limit was installed.
The miner soft caps you're referring to do NOT affect the node consensus tests, as full nodes ONLY care about the size being greater than 1MB (and other consensus-related tests, of course).
The EC, as implemented in BU and other new clients, is an entirely different model for client consensus.
@_date: 2016-03-08 05:28:29
LOL! I honestly can't stand these guys, so I really do appreciate your personal sacrifice!
That said, I don't use Coinbase as a wallet either. I do use them as an on and off ramp, though, so I guess I'll just wait and see what comes from these rumors -- if anything.
Ironically, I just got an email today letting me know that their live exchange and USD account services are finally available in Virginia. I considered throwing a few coins in there to test their exchange engine, but now I think I'll just wait a week or two to see if they make any crazy announcements.
I envy you for your upcoming vacation... seriously, I hope you have fun and forget all about this nonsense for a bit! Sadly, though, I'm pretty sure all the same drama will be here waiting for you when you return...

But he did, in fact, provide an example of how it could be raised in the future; so, it's fairly disingenuous to say that he never commented on it at all.
He was never explicit about why he installed the limit, but he certainly acknowledged and implied that the limit was likely temporary.

Yes, they can see what's in each address (although your wallet could contain countless addresses).

But, there *is* already a reason. Hell, even the Core devs have stated that using one to raise the block size, specifically, will likely still be necessary in the next year or two.
Will it suddenly become easier to do the required hard fork in 2017, or something? If so, why?
I just don't understand why we're delaying the inevitable even when nearly everyone, including the Core devs and LN devs, has admitted that it's inevitable. It just makes no sense to me...

I'm sorry, but anything that allows you to send bitcoin to someone without knowing their wallet address IS very impressive, and much needed.
It's obviously much easier to ask someone for their phone number than it is to ask them for a random 32 character alphanumeric code or QR.
This also prevents you from having to worry about people changing their wallet address on a regular basis since the recipient is the one who chooses where the coins go.

They did not have a warrant of any sort at the time they were probing the server's home and login pages.  Their initial actions to obtain the IP address were the basis for warrants issued thereafter, which is why the nature (legality) of those actions is so critical to the case.

The primary issue with BU, specifically, is that it grants way too much power over the system to miners (via Emergent Consensus(EC)).
EC is by far the worst possible solution that big blockers could have rallied behind.
I want larger blocks than Core is willing to provide at this time, as well, and I absolutely abhor their stubborn refusal to compromise; but, there's simply no chance in hell that I'll ever endorse an EC implementation for the reason I stated above.
Granting that much power to miners could/would easily be the biggest mistake in Bitcoin's storied history.

Classic doesn't need to include RBF to remain compatible and competitive with a 2MB coordinated hard fork. 
In fact, Classic could become the go-to non-RBF client. That could be one of the perks of running Classic vs running Core that users could factor into their client decision.
That said, I don't know what Classic's ultimate decision would be on RBF. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:39:46
Nothing you've written there is correct. Hell, it doesn't even make sense.
The gross cost to run the network every day has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin itself, period. Said price is only a factor if a) you're discussing **net** costs, and b) you're assuming all mined coins are being sold every day to reach your (currently) $1.5M total.
Pro tip: If it only costs $500k to run the network on any particular day, then it's completely possible that only $500k worth of coins are being sold by miners that day to cover their overhead costs. The other ~$1M worth of coins mined that day become either realized or unrealized **profits**...not costs.
All of which is irrelevant when the only point is/was to prove that "millions spent every day to secure the network" is just plain false. The actual costs to do so are between $450k to $750k per day -- with closer to $750k being the norm.

@_date: 2016-03-05 17:27:22
No, I do not agree that it's enough.
The effective increase we gain from SegWit may take up to a year, or longer, to reach its estimated maximum of roughly 1.75mb.
IMO, that's still much too slow, and it will do very little to mitigate the issues we're facing in the next six months.
@_date: 2016-03-06 17:57:00

I can guarantee the **vast majority** of the community (not counting core devs themselves) would readily accept a 2mb hard fork for Core **today** if you made it available, so your comment doesn't make much sense to me since Core hasn't even presented it as an option.
Core could release it tomorrow with an activation set for June and the entire community would rejoice and celebrate for weeks on end.

Well, once we have a measurable impact on average tx size for each of those (awesome!) improvements, we can recalculate everything in the OP based on the new value, rather than the 500kb value used by both the LN devs and myself.  Fair enough?

I don't think you understand what a "fee market" would look like. 
You, the user/consumer, will need to know, or have a wallet that somehow determines, the actual minimum suggested fee to use **at every individual moment in time.** Said minimum fees will dynamically change at every moment based on fees being paid by competing transactions, global transaction volume, backlog, transaction sizes, miners altering selection criteria, etc.
None of the above would likely be done by the wallet software itself, so there will need to be new websites and tools developed to determine and provide all of this information to every wallet, and that information will need to be near real-time.
Anything less than knowing exactly what fee to use at any given moment in time would result in either stuck transactions, unacceptable extended delays, or consistently having to manually over-pay your fees just to avoid the entire mess described above.
THAT is what an actual "fee market" will look like -- at least for a while -- and it's going to REALLY fucking suck for users and the entire user experience.


Let's say that we ignore the mess I described above and somehow figure out a decent way to handle all of that in a friendly manner for consumers.
Now let's say that the wonderful new fee market (that is based on 1MB blocks) gets very well established and is running for quite some time. All of the users and miners have adjusted their strategies and business plans to said market, and all is well with the world.
Now, a couple of years into this free fee market utopia, we decide to raise the block size to 10 or 20MB....WAM....BOOM...BANG! Fuuuckkk, the entire Bitcoin economy just got flipped on its fucking head because years of business plans and best practices just got thrown out the window.  
Simply additional supply, you say? Yeah right. The effects at that point would rattle the Bitcoin economy to its core, no miners would accept the change, and innovations like Lightning Network will also be crippled for some time.


The only negative consequences I've seen mentioned, by any developer, are 1) delaying the development of a fee market, 2) making it slightly more expensive to run a full node, and 3) *possibly* reducing motivations to develop other solutions. 
Did I miss any? 
I'd much rather deal with those consequences than the nightmare of full blocks and a ridiculously painful fee market that scares off every potential new user on the planet.
Pro tip:  Even the Lightning Network will require Bitcoin's block size to be larger than 1MB when Bitcoin adoption goes parabolic.

I just think you're wrong. Very few software changes would need to be made throughout the ecosystem to support a 2MB fork. In fact, my guess is that both SegWit and LN will take *much* longer to integrate everywhere. With SW, we're going to see a significantly reduced security profile for a while (until all full nodes upgrade), and LN will require starting adoption efforts from scratch with nearly every merchant and business on the planet. 
IMO, If they set activation for July 15th, a 2MB hard fork would work out just fine.
And yes, I've been a computer scientist for roughly 25 years, so I do know a thing or two about software rollouts and updates -- especially those involving critical patches. 
I also believe that app developers, node operators, miners, and other businesses throughout the Bitcoin ecosystem are absolutely paying *much* closer attention to these developments than in other software projects, so it won't face nearly the same levels of complacency and ignorance witnessed elsewhere.

Semantics again. I didn't mean that it would be sent at an entirely different time. I meant that it would be sent as separated components.
The witness data is *segregated* (aka "separated") from the part of the tx covered by the txid -- which is how/why nodes can elect to prune all witness data and/or never download it in the first place. IOW, it's a separated/segregated component -- hence, its namesake.


In order to surpass an "effective 2MB," I believe it would require every tx in the block to be SW, and each of those would have to be some sort of complex SW multisig transaction. The SW devs stated as much last year, and it's why I wouldn't ever describe that possibility as *realistic*.


Please show me the BIP, or any other public discussion of a 2MB+SW hard fork, specifically, that you are using as evidence to support your claim that "the community already rejected that."
Otherwise, that claim is utter bullshit. Your team never even gave "the community" a chance to consider it.

How is it not? Would you still pay taxes if there were no direct consequences, or the threat of consequences, for not doing so? Even if the answer is *yes*, that would make it charity, not taxation.
You do understand that they're taking what is YOUR money, right?
Bitcoin's future prospects, and effects, go well beyond business and wealth. Limiting your own understanding of fundamentals to those of the miners and exchange owners who only seek profit tells me that you have a very limited imagination, as well as very little character.

The majority chain (which may assume the name "Bitcoin") would not be yours, but a quick POW change after the attack would ensure that your minority chain continues to exist as its own network (likely with a new name -- an altcoin).
Doing nothing in response to an attack by the new majority chain's miners would ensure your destruction.

I would personally prefer a small simultaneous increase (as a stop-gap) with a proper version of SW as a hardfork, as well, but I intentionally left that opinion out of my OP because that wasn't the point of this thread.
(I've also pretty much given up on trying to convince Core to compromise, both publicly and behind the scenes...)
As I said, though, this thread was an honest attempt to look "beyond LN" with the assumption that SWaaSF activates and we all get back on track with the original Core Roadmap.

Best estimates for SegWit are an effective 1.6x to 2x increase based on current transaction behavior, so he's (perhaps intentionally?) misleading you by using 4MB and 8MB to make his point.

It's not a good thing. Once they remove the opt-in aspect once and for all -- which is definitely Peter Todd's end goal -- RBF may damage any/all businesses that rely on zero confirmation transactions -- even those that willingly assume the risk after careful considerations/analysis.
It will also destroy any/all chances of ever using main blockchain Bitcoin transactions in brick and mortar stores -- thus forcing such businesses to instead rely on other (currently unavailable) solutions like Lightning Network, etc.

Actually, did you know that SegWit can be implemented with a 0% discount rate, thus providing all of the other SW benefits, but without any capacity increase.
That discount rate could then be gradually increased through future soft forks to gradually raise the effective increase.
In other words, we *could* have 2MB+SW without *any* growth beyond 2MB this year if we wanted to! We could then control additional growth by raising the SW discount variable in the future. ;)

Who said anything about capacity, specifically? Not I.
There are more aspects of the system that require scaling than just capacity.

Changing the number *does* help, though. In fact, with the added benefit of things like SegWit, simple changes to "a number" provide for an almost 2(n) improvement each time.

People could/would still pay fees because the miners themselves could/should impose their own competitive minimum fees. 
Also, please note that I clearly said that the growth should keep pace with the boundaries of network/system capabilities, *not* user demand. 
In other words, I'd actually be ok with maxing out the capacity if it was due to the network operating AT/NEAR the network's actual limits, in terms of capability/decentralization.
We're simply not at that point, even with the ~1.75MB SegWit *may* provide *sometime* in the future. I feel that there is a little additional room to grow total capacity beyond that figure without negatively/noticeably affecting decentralization.

The majority of the Core and LN devs have repeatedly admitted that a hard fork to increase block size will still be **necessary** in the not-so-distant future.
So yes, there is a reason.
It's the delay in spite of that fact that remains inexplicable.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:46:29
I'm my scenario, Core would only push the new POW HF if it is known that BU has the super-majority of hashpower -- which is probably 80+%.
The reason it's 80+% is because that's a figure the majority chain would likely need to successfully expend 25% of that power to attack Core's 20% minority chain while still retaining their own 51+% of the total. Make sense?
Either way, a POW HF would essentially be admitting defeat, and not something used for a neck-in-neck battle for the title of "Bitcoin." It's merely a last ditch attempt at survival as an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:52:06
It's not that I don't know what I'm talking about -- we're simply talking past one another, because semantics.
I'm referring to the "effective blocksize" provided by the discount, which is roughly the equivalent of 1.7 to 2MB "worth" of tx squeezed into the first 1,000,000 bytes after having their witness data stripped and sent as a separated (segregated) component -- for a total of 4,000,000 bytes.
Using this "effective block size" comparison (or equivalence) to today's tx threshold is how most of us peons  describe the benefits of SW.
Or, a better way to describe it may be "1.7x to 2x the current number of tx in a 1MB block."

The real question is this: **will merely doubling the tx capacity be sufficient to support mass adoption of layer two solutions like Lightning Network?**
The answer to that is actually a resounding **NO**.
So, now what? Additional on-chain scaling is absolutely required. When? Probably a lot sooner than some, like Luke, will admit. So, again, now what?
BU and EC are not the answer -- they're f'n terrible -- so, we must keep brainstorming and testing other ideas for hard forks that would scale the chain well into the future **and properly support second layer solutions**.
It's a very hard problem, and one that I suspect we'll need an answer to sooner, rather than later. If I had to guess (and that's all it is), LN alone may completely overwhelm the mainchain in just 3-5 years.

The irony with that entire ideal is that most of the people in the regions you're referring to could never have afforded to run a node -- even in 2009 -- let alone now or in the future. They simply don't own many personal computers, consistent access to the internet itself is extremely rare, and most of them don't/can't even have data plans for their mobile phones.
If the entire plan is to design nodes that they can somehow still run themselves, then we're simply never going to get anywhere in that regard, and the entire rest of the network will be held back as a result.
Those same people can't afford fees much higher than what we have now, either, so it's going to be VERY interesting to see how well the fees for Lightning Network are structured for those developing regions of the world.
I'm optimistic that we may eventually figure out ways to bring this tech to them, but I also fear that the entire experiment will be held back if we limit the scaling based on the mistaken belief that people in developing regions will run nodes. How can they possibly even begin to think about doing so when their entire communications infrastructure is limited to old feature phones?  Seriously, entire businesses are run using *flip phones* as their only connections to the outside world.
It's one hell of a conundrum, for sure.

BitTorrent does not require specialized equipment to secure the network -- equipment that is primarily built and subsequently operated in China.
China can never completely destroy Bitcoin, but they can certainly make it nearly useless and worthless in the short term given their borderline monopoly on miners and mining equipment.

Correct. They are more concerned with market manipulation and market fraud than they are with individuals committing other random money-related crimes (like laundering or tax evasion).

Luke consistently pushes for a SMALLER limit because his home DSL supposedly can't effectively handle anything over 400kb blocks.

I was confused by that, as well.
However, I think it means that they would only be authorized to loan out the amount they take in, rather than any amounts above and beyond the deposits.
In other words, they could loan out a certain percentage of deposits, total, but they couldn't loan out any amount above the deposits.
Example: If they have 1 billion in hard deposits, they could loan out up to 1 billion -- but nothing *above* 1 billion (which would be considered "created money").

There have been many discussions similar to this one over the last few years, so you're definitely not alone in your vision.  Even Andreas sees a future with countless alternative currencies flourishing and competing with one another -- to the point that communities, corporations, and even individuals would each have their own coin.  He describes currency as a form of expression, therefore it's logical to assume that like-minded people will congregate with one another and develop their own shared forms of expression (in this case, currencies that cater to their commonly held belief, common goals, etc).
The idea that centralized governments may eventually be broken down into more diverse and decentralized communities is also not a new concept (but, it's certainly fascinating!)  Many science fiction authors have "predicted" as much over the years.
Have you read Isaac Asimov?  If not, check out his "Foundation" novels.  They're a really interesting glimpse into one possible future that ties in VERY well with many of the (intended) core aspects of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies (or decentralization in general).
It's always nice to "meet" others who have wild and incredible ideas about the future, so well met! :)

You can't put that genie back in the bottle, and my four nodes are running just fine for less than $30 each per month. If the cost to run them ever becomes a burden, I'll let you know.

My entire previous post was just an example of what a compromise would (will) look like with a coordinated rollout of both SegWit and the upcoming 2MB hard fork -- but only if Core figures out how to be flexible with their original road map.

The two concepts -- competition and collaboration -- are not mutually exclusive.
Plenty of Red Hat Linux developers contributed code to the main branches that benefited competing Linux-based products.
Bitpay has contributed quite handsomely to the entire Bitcoin ecosystem while simultaneously competing with Coinbase and others.
Competition is healthy. Why do you fear it so much?
The beauty of competition+collaboration in open source is that the entities involved compete on the actual merit of the services and interfaces they wrap around the shared code.  Users can/will migrate to those solutions that fit their needs while the quality of all available options improves together.

Herein lies one of the key components. How trustless will the "ad-hoc groups" of notaries be? Who/what will act as notaries? Will they be DAC's, or will they be real-world third parties? Both? this is where we need to watch closely for centralized influences:

I believe there are still asserts in Core, as well, but they're only located in the deepest recesses where/when a hard crash is preferred -- rather than compromise -- because keys are involved.
The problems BU is having are due to their overuse of asserts all over the damn place in easy to reach areas of the code (via simple malformed messaging).

First, it was estimated that widespread use of LN would require at least 133MB blocks (7 billion people, each opening 2 channels per year). 
Second, I provided details last year as to how we could leverage the discount rates in SW (via subsequent soft forks) to slowly increase SW's effectiveness following a proper 2MB+SW hard fork -- up to a total of 8MB data (tx+witness), including an "effective" 3.4MB of just tx (versus a maximum effective 1.7MB with today's SW softfork).
Third, such a compromise would have assuaged most miners' concerns last Spring and provided all of us the additional time necessary to prepare a more permanent solution (for blocksize itself) -- to be rolled out in a second hard fork 3-5 years later.
Fourth, I've been involved with this experiment for even longer than this 4 year old reddit account would indicate. I mined, bought, and traded away my first coins in 2010, and I've been actively involved in a professional capacity ever since.
Like I said, you don't know me. That's ok, though, because knowing me isn't really important for this discussion. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:48:06
That's not even remotely true. 
Every piece of transaction software in the entire ecosystem will need to be patched to support SegWit in order for the network to reach the theoretical 1.75 to 2x effective increase.
The effective/observable increase from SegWit will be gradual over the months/year following its release. We have absolutely no idea how long it will take to reach the entire ecosystem.

Greg, I absolutely appreciate and agree with everything you've written regarding **near**-full spectrum scalability for Bitcoin; and, I'm really looking forward to experiencing the positive impacts of both SegWit and Lightning Network in the future.
However, that said, I do not believe anything you've written here negates the fact that main Bitcoin can, and should, keep pace with the maximum cpu, storage, and bandwidth capabilities of the network. By that I mean to say that blocksize should ALSO increase at a pace that is reasonable within the boundaries/capabilities of the network, *and as long as said increases would have little/no impact on decentralization.*
With that in mind, I think you could probably even agree that said boundaries currently lie somewhere between 2-4MB, not just the 1-1.75MB we *may* see with SegWit much later this year.
Have you considered my previous proposal of implementing a SegWit+2MB solution with the appropriately "throttled" variables that would give us an instant increase to 2MB and allow for soft fork increases above that as necessary during the next few years (using patches to SW's discount rate)?
Such a solution would satisfy nearly everything while still holding the growth in check to ensure continued decentralization.
It bothers me tremendously that such a combined solution is not being seriously considered, or even commented on. Hell, it doesn't even affect the current SegWit timeline IF it's planned and executed properly.

Why? What do you *think* you know about me? Which part of my posts hit you in the feels?
My point is that your vitriol is completely uncalled for. I'm not a BU supporter, and I stopped actively participating in ALL of the bitcoin subs last summer because of attitudes like yours. I did not, however, stop contributing to the bitcoin ecosystem -- I make my living doing so.
If you met me in my professional capacity, and we discussed crypto, I have a feeling you'd love to know me... because I'm actually a pretty swell dude. :)
You should probably save your claws for someone who actually means to do you harm. That ain't me.
A proper Core hard fork has always been a perfectly reasonable suggestion. After all, most of the Core devs I've spoken to directly over the years agree that one is inevitable. The point of my OP was that we could have begun that process last year and avoided a lot of the mess with BU (and others) had there just been a very reasonable compromise with reasonable timelines.
If you continue with the unprovoked attacks, I'll ignore you from here on out. However, if you can lose the unnecessary hostility, I'd love to read an articulate response to the idea of a compromise hard fork in 2017/2018.
Core could easily still pivot and cut BU (and others) off at their knees, just as they could have prevented the rise of BU in the first place with a compromise 2MB+SW hard fork last year.

Instead, traders will simply use them as playthings for pump and dumps throughout the year.
They're essentially just a casino game.

You do realize that 1mb+SW isn't large enough to support proper layer 2 scaling, right? (Ref: LN devs)
That's the reason Core still has a blocksize hard fork on their roadmap after LN is implemented, and it's also one of the many legs the "big block position" can stand on.
And no, SW does not "give up to 4mb blocks." At best, if *every* tx in the entire system is a SW tx, the increase is only an effective 1.7 to 2x.
@_date: 2016-01-12 05:33:44
Ok. Honestly, though, whose problem is that as long as they still honor their coverage for double-spends?
It's their risk, not yours or mine. I'm quite certain that Coinbase has done their own risk assessments. Charlie Lee said as much on Reddit last night.
Peter should have demonstrated this issue using a cooperative merchant that accepts bitcoin directly, not an unwitting third party payment processor that offers double-spend protection for all of their clients.
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:20:20
The progression of SegWit's effects on size could be throttled by using/removing the rate setting; thus allowing for both SW and a 2MB hard fork simultaneously, while still not growing the effective capacity increase beyond 2MB this year.

Not true.
The Internet itself still runs on the core protocols designed by Khan and his team in 1973-1974 -- TCP and UDP.
The TCP was invented specifically to facilitate the concept of "internetting," and it's been in use ever since.
Anything prior to that, such as the ARPANET using NCP, was not "The Internet." ;)

False. Existing solutions are all centralized and vulnerable (see: RSA hacks and NSA backdoors).
The one profound feature that Bitcoin brought to the table that *never existed before* -- and that is pretty much the only reason it's interesting and useful -- is **trustlessness**.
No other trustless solution exists.

Resource exhaustion.
The fear is that large miners will collude and intentionally set higher than necessary blocksizes to exhaust the resources of all smaller competitors, thus squeezing those smaller operators out of the market.
The end result is a system with only a few very large miners who are primarily located in China.
Users themselves wouldn't notice much of a change, so the system would still appear to be working just fine, and the resulting centralization may not even be reflected in the market price. However, for those who understand that decentralization is **the** uniquely valuable aspect of the entire system, such an outcome would signal the death of the entire concept.

Essentially everything else has been worked on except the hardfork solutions loosely described in the "Finally" section of their roadmap. 
They also (in various posts and emails) consistently acknowledged that a hard fork to increase on-chain blocksize is likely necessary to allow Layer2 solutions to properly scale. (Ref: discussions of LN requirements)

The only issue with a vanilla POW change is that we might be right back where we are today once new Asics become the norm again.
I haven't spoken to Luke about his defensive patch, but do you happen to know whether or not he's taken that possibility into account with the new algorithm? Is it designed to be more asic-resistant?
There's also an option I've only heard whispers of over the last few years: perhaps the POW could change on a code-regulated schedule every X years? The economic effects of something like that may be manageable if miners know it's coming (like the halvings)... really not sure, though...hmm

Actually, that was never proven at all. In fact, Mt Gox never led the market during the November 2013 bubble.
The vast majority of that meteoric rise was the result of whales trading in Chinese exchanges that led the rally every single day. They also led the collapse that began on December 17, 2013.

So, perhaps justifying 501c3 status may be as easy as locating the new nodes throughout the developing world in order to further develop their connections to the global economy and global markets?

@_date: 2016-01-12 22:18:00
I tend to agree with everything you just wrote. My first involvement was actually in 2010 -- just with a different name, and not quite as active. I never got directly involved with the development at the time, but I was certainly paying attention for a while. (Sadly, I bailed out from December 2010 until mid 2013... DOH!)
Anyways, like Mike and Gavin, I'm very much onboard with the Satoshi vision you touched on -- which is why I support a moderate increase, preferably dynamic, in order to maintain Bitcoin's access and affordability for everyone.
That said, following some fantastic lengthy discussions with Greg, I also support and look forward to other solutions like LN and SW that will augment and enhance any actual blocksize increases we make.
I honestly just want to see a truly trustless/decentralized solution expand to cover the entire globe and provide affordable access to the billions who are currently unbanked. It will definitely take patience and a coordinated effort using both on and off-chain solutions; but, like Satoshi (and Mike, etc), I'm very optimistic for the future.  
I think we'll get there, I really do. :)

While that's generally true around here, this theory is still plausible, and it is based on an understanding of how the markets actually work.
I personally know several traders who had their stop purchases hit during this movement, and then had to scramble to exit without loss.

No, because the decision is based entirely on potential profits, not on some voiced ideology or earnest support for one solution versus the other.
They're not saying anything akin to, *"I hope Core wins, so I'm buying BCC tokens."*
That's what "putting their money where their mouth is" would mean in this scenario, but traders aren't doing that.
Real traders are much more pragmatic than that: *"I think BCC is trending up right now, so I'll buy it low. Tomorrow, I believe BCC may top out, so I'll sell my BCC and park the money in USD while I prepare for the next moves in either BCU, BTC, LTC, ETH, etc."*

What if I told you that I have no problem with limited taxation, either? My point was that it still qualifies as "confiscation," regardless of the social contract; because, said "contract" relies entirely on their threat of violence, not something any of us ever agreed to as individuals.
I wasn't speaking to its justification.
That said, miners and exchanges are merely tools used for security and price discovery, respectively. The real future prospects for Bitcoin lie in how each of those may be leveraged to *actually* revolutionize.
The reason this conversation may not be interesting to you is because it began with you admitting that profit and wealth are your only motivations, while simultaneously assigning labels and motivations to anyone who isn't here for that reason.
In other words, you think small.
Good luck with that.

What you are describing was exactly my understanding of the LN system prior to introducing the "Bitcoin Banks" concept above. It was his initial post here that sent me down the Bitcoin Bank rabbit hole, because what he was saying sounded much more like third parties controlling access to LN nodes/channels.
That said, what's to stop a company like Coinbase from signing up major retailers  for "LN Management Services," and then somehow controlling access to the last leg of all paths leading to those retailers?  If they or anyone else are able to do so, then what kind of restrictions or demands, if any, could they impose on random non-Coinbase users wishing to pay those retailers with LN?
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:02:19
I'm sorry, man, but I'm done trying to explain very rudimentary business concepts to you.
Bottom line: the price of bitcoin has **absolutely nothing** to do with *the calculation* of gross overhead costs to process/secure the network every day.

Actually, Segwit was initially designed as a hardfork (as implemented in the Elements Alpha sidechain code). 
It was later implemented as a softfork for Core after the devs collectively decided that a hardfork would be too dangerous.
Segwit as a hardfork would actually be a much cleaner solution. It would also solve the problem of "anyone can spend" transactions that resulted from implementing it as a softfork.

@_date: 2016-01-18 02:34:05
No we don't. Why? Because the probability of EVERY transaction in the blockchain being 3-3 multisig, or higher multi-sig combinations, is as close to zero as you can possibly get.
That's exactly what's required for the theoretical 4x by the way.
Don't come at me with that bullshit.

Indeed, it would. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:51:23
Yes, It's a big deal. But, so is a soft fork that essentially turns all non-upgraded full nodes into pseduo-SPV clients, or worse. (Referring to SegWit).
It's not like hard forks will magically become easier in 2017 or 2018 either. Hell, it might even become exponentially *more* difficult to roll out a hard fork if the number of users, nodes, and miners suddenly increases dramatically.
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:08:46
They absolutely do. However, if they all begin to collude in an effort to block specific transactions, or specific individuals, the entire system quickly begins to lose its appeal.
Such collusion could easily end in blacklists, and that's an idea we should never entertain.
As I said, it's simply a very slippery slope.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:07:39
That 2.1 figure was based on an out-of-context quote during a radio show, and subsequently included in a random medium blog post.
The context for it was exactly as I described -- anything beyond 2MB requires full blocks of *only* complex SW multisig transactions.

@_date: 2017-03-26 16:55:30


That's not the argument they're using, though.
Emergent Consensus would lead to PayPal 2.0 after the largest miners game the EC system to eliminate their smaller competitors (and most nodes) through resource exhaustion. The end result is a single miner (or OPEC-style mining cabal) that controls the future of the entire system -- aka *PayPal 2.0.*
It's very telling that BU's biggest supporter (and financier), Roger Ver, **has admitted to that possibility**, but everyone else who is following him down the rabbit hole doesn't even seem to care...at all.
They are entirely willing to give up decentralization altogether just to gain the throughput needed for a few million more users (rather than billions).
It's...pathetic...and sad.

The LN devs did make that calculation and arrived at 24GB blocks required for 7 billion users doing 2 on-chain tx per day.  :)
My main point was that a popular LN itself would still require larger blocks, as well. How much larger? I guess that's a factor of layer1+layer2 demand and other new ways to make the current size more efficient? (such as schnorr sigs)
The 133MB figure was assuming no further improvements in efficiency, so it would obviously need to be adjusted downward as such things are implemented.

You and I both know that a hard fork -- or "firm soft fork" -- is coming in the next year or two that will raise the current block size limit, so please stop trying to play me for a fool.

Lots of smart people also agree with me. (That was a nice attempt at a dig, though! /s)
I'm not trying to rehash the entire debate here, but you know as well as I do that most of the devs who disagree with (or simply have reservations about) Gavin's specific implementation DO still agree that the block size should be increased.
But, even after years of debate on this subject, they (those who disagree) still haven't provided any code for alternative ways to do it, though, so I have very little faith in their ability to ever decide or otherwise reach a dev consensus.
Gavin's lack of commits during the last year is completely irrelevant.

The subsidy will remain significant for at least the next 4.5 years, and possibly even longer if adoption goes up dramatically... so why does "sometime" = now?
Second, if they already know that a hard fork with a blocksize increase is going to happen sometime in the next 2-3 years -- they've stated as much -- then why wait and knowingly cause an economic shock to the shiny new fee market when that happens?

That "don't hold us to it" is the entire problem with the original road map -- it left the door too far open to never actually doing a hard fork.

You put an awful lot of faith in that particular **theory**.


So, let's do the damn 2-3MB increase, and then we can talk about this whole "fee market" thing once we **actually have** viable off-chain solutions for microtransactions. Deal? Excellent. Now, make it happen please.


While that's a wonderful fantasy, it's also unrealistic -- to the point of being absurd -- unless there's a literal quantum leap in cell phone computing power. Basing any sort of short or mid-term engineering decisions on that pipedream would actually be quite irresponsible. Let's try to stay in the present and grounded in the reality of our current and near-future technical limitations, shall we? 
Unless, like Luke-jr, you actually believe we should reduce the blocksize, rather than raise it, in order to fulfill your (his) cell phone and nodes-on-DSL fantasies?

It's ridiculous to believe that they are/were unaware of the risks associated with zero-conf transactions.

I've never seen anyone argue about the eventuality of a fee market once the block subsidy no longer supports the mining infrastructure.

That has nothing at all to do with this otherwise technical discussion of capacity. The LTC network can still handle four times more transactions per second than bitcoin, and it's also decentralized.


Source? Do you any data at all to back up that inflammatory assertion?


Gee, that sure is a profound argument ya got there, chief!
It's always been said that alt coins can prove tremendously valuable to bitcoin development if we treat them as interesting experiments and incorporate some of their best aspects into Bitcoin itself.
Do you disagree with that philosophy? If so, why?


Wow. You're not a very technical guy, are you? I'm guessing that you've never actually studied the LTC code, because there are several very interesting differences in the litecoin consensus system and tx structure. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:32:31
Unless you're ok with a network that has dramatically lowered security, or none at all, the same is true with a soft fork SegWit.
Following the soft fork for SW, non-upgraded user nodes will be providing *nothing* to the security of the network.  At that point, they might as well be turned OFF, just as they would be with a hard fork.

They've gone full casino at this point. The tokens themselves won't provide any meaningful data or accurate reflections of sentiment. Instead, they'll only act as playthings for traders to pump and dump between now and December, with no deeper meaning or insight whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:32:38
The SEC wants the collective market share (volume) of the regulated exchanges to exceed the market share of the unregulated exchanges.
In other words, there won't be an ETF until fully regulated (and surveilable) exchanges like Kraken, ItBit, Coinbase, and Gemini collectively have a MUCH larger share of total global trade volume.
Until then, the SEC believes the unregulated exchanges around the world are way too easy to manipulate without detection mechanisms and defined user protections (aka "surveillance").
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:25:44
Yes, because I'm sure they'll stop there once they've eliminated most smaller competitors AND kicked the vast majority of nodes out of the network by gaming EC.
Emergent Consensus is by far the worst possible idea that **my fellow big blockers** could have rallied behind. It's a virus that will likely kill the host.

I agree. We need a few BIPs with decent ideas for compensating node operators.

@_date: 2017-03-20 19:53:44
Absolutely false. You are lying.
You never gave anyone that option, and I see/hear users in both subs still asking (practically begging) for this exact compromise **EVERY.SINGLE.DAY.**
I approached the devs and community with the concept more than a year ago -- including details on how to leverage the discount rate to govern the pace of increases and resource requirements.
The community response here on Reddit was positive, yet the devs I spoke with didn't want anything to do with it -- they were sticking with their one plan and nothing would change that.
So, it is only *you*, the devs, who rejected it -- not "the community."
Fuck, man, I practically begged the SW devs to help me flesh out a standard BIP for the concept, and they just completely blew me off.
**I DARE YOU** to post a poll with the following simple question:  
*"Would you support a 2MB+Segwit hard fork for Core that immediately raises the real max blocksize to 2MB, and then slowly raises the 'effective' blocksize from 2 to ~3.4MB over a 3 year period?"*
Math: SW Discount Rate +12.5% every six months (or X blocks), capping at the 75% rate that is equal to today's SW softfork.
Once "the community" sees that it's you who is asking that question, I'm absolutely convinced the results will prove you wrong.
Better yet, help me draft and champion a BIP, and we'll f'n do this right.

They currently don't offer margin trading on these tokens, but they left the door open for that possibility in their announcement.
That fact will help prevent some of the gaming, at least for a time, but I just don't think many traders see (or use) their daily positions as any sort of sentimental expression.

I disagree and believe they actually low-balled the extrapolation. Their calculations assumed just one channel per person every six months, which was an overly conservative assumption.


I'd say that pretty effectively sums up your entire response.
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:10:25
Yes, they are -- which is why most Core devs said we'd need 9-12 months to do one properly. 
Guess how long it's been since they said that. That's right, 9-12 months. We could have done a fairly safe hard fork -- as safe as can be expected -- had they just committed to a compromise HF last Spring.
There is still a planned hard fork on Core's own roadmap after SW and LN. Guess what it's for? That's right, a more permanent on-chain block size increase.
Imagine that. All this contentious bullshit, and it turns out we're still going to do it all again in a few years anyways.
It's almost comical...

@_date: 2017-03-11 19:31:35
If it's ultimately in their best interests to eliminate the minority chain completely, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they collaborated to double spend (attack) the minority chain.
I also suspect that much more than 75% of the total hashing would flock to the new majority chain after a successful split at 75%. In reality, following the split, the minority chain may be reduced to as little as 10-15%, or less, so an attack on that chain by the new majority would actually require *much* less hashing power than 30%.
And yes, *shitshow* is probably the perfect word to describe all of the above. No doubt about that.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:11:02
The only logical reason I can think of that might explain Core's stubborn refusal to even consider this compromise is the fact that millions of dollars have already been spent throughout the ecosystem by those who upgraded their tools and software to be compatible with the SW softfork.
Maybe the Core devs are simply afraid to look those people in the eye and tell them that they have to do it all over again for a completely different version of SW?
That's seriously the only benevolent explanation I can think of.
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:24:19
Exhibit A.
I didn't say or imply any of that. My comments above were intentionally more vague, because the issues around here go well beyond the ridiculous scaling feuds.
Your jump to conclusions and subsequent assumptions are a prime example of the toxicity I was referring to -- it permeates *every* discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:58:33
With just 1MB+SW, not many adults will be able to use LN either -- which was the point of the LN dev's published estimate in the first place.
The Core devs acknowledged this fact long ago, and that is why there is a block size hardfork on the Core roadmap after LN.
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:29:42
It's prudent to prepare a defensive POW change just in case a split does happen and Core ends up as the minority chain.
The change is meant to protect the Core chain from being attacked by the new majority chain's excess mining capacity.
NOT preparing for that remote possibility would actually be negligent.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:14:47
Luke-jr has been in the Core slack channel all week already advocating and planning for an immediate change to their POW if theirs becomes the shortest chain, thus creating CoreCoin to defend against an easy 51% attack.
Hell, he's even been talking to a chip maker in there to coordinate new mining ASICs.
In other words, it doesn't sound like he wants or plans to support a matching 2MB patch for Core any time soon.
I can only hope that cooler Core heads prevail.

That's fantastic news! I'll let Jon and Gavin know that we've come to an agreement.
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:05:31
The scalability roadmap was too ambiguous, with regards to a hard fork, and left the door too far open for the possibility that a hard fork might never happen.
It's time for Core to commit to a hard fork within a reasonable time frame -- months, not years -- and for Classic to commit to coordinating on a compatible version of said hard fork with an identical timeline for activation.

@_date: 2017-03-19 02:55:55
And yet, there's still a blocksize hard fork on Core's own roadmap after LN's implementation.
Why? Because layer 2 solutions, like LN, still require larger on-chain blocks than SW alone can provide.
Doesn't that effectively destroy the entire notion that Core is entirely against hard forks to increase blocksize?
Yes. Yes it does.
@_date: 2016-01-06 02:48:09
Will you actively oppose, or use your influence as a developer to impede, the use of the main blockchain for such things in the future (since you've deemed them pointless)?
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:42:07
And yet, regardless of its smaller block size, litecoin still manages to have 4x the theoretical max tps (or more) by using other variables to control capacity and flow -- shorter block time, anti-spam via fee-per-output, etc.

Yes, but decentralized payment channel solutions pegged to (and secured by) the blockchain are supposed to be the answer to maintaining my security/privacy without high fees.

Unsourced? The SW devs themselves are the source, and it's still included on the Bitcoincore.org page itself (last updated in November 2016):


[Is BitcoinCore itself a good source?](
That said, if every tx uses the new Segwit address format, which isn't implemented yet, and every tx in a single block is also a complex SW multisig tx of some sort, we may see some blocks with an effective size above 2MB.

However, if it's **received** for a sale of goods or services, it's considered income.
It's also considered normal income if you mine it, with the income value being equal to the price of the coin the moment it was mined (or sent the moment it was awarded to you by a pool).

Of course there will be some who still want to use it, regardless of high fees -- those being large corporations and the ultra-wealthy who can afford high fees because said fees are still lower, transfer times are still faster, and transactions still more obfuscated, than their traditional banking alternatives.
The obvious problem, of course, is that this race toward a limited pool of wealthy entities directly using the ledger virtually guarantees that **everyone else** gets pushed off-chain; and, coincidentally, into the hands of some of those very same large corporations (as we all become off-chain service customers).

That is factually incorrect given today's transaction/usage behavior (number of multisig tx, etc). The realistic estimate is a multiplying factor of just 1.6x to 2x.
**Here's an accurate version of your statement**:  
So with MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=1MB SegWit gives an effective max block size somewhere in the range of 1.6MB - 2MB

Agreed. Such a scenario would certainly involve a lot of factors based on timing.
If a defensive POW HF is executed quickly enough, the minority chain would not cease to exist. If they do nothing to defend themselves at that point, it probably would.
I'm not sure what the end result would look like for the minority chain, or how useful it would be, but at least it would still exist in one form or another.

I'm not afraid of anything beyond BU and Core collectively and egregiously fucking up this entire experiment. Your assumptions are misplaced.
That said, you're obviously not an actual trader. 
Pro tip: actual traders are not "putting their money where their mouths are" -- they're putting it wherever they think they'll make the most profit, period. Full stop.
Ideologies are best left at the door.
@_date: 2016-03-08 04:33:10
That's nonsense. 
Reaching capacity is reaching capacity, regardless of the cause or intent. Such attacks being temporary is also irrelevant.
The fact of the matter is that the network was at capacity for several days last week, so saying "not this week" or "not at the moment" would be a perfectly valid response.

We're likely several years away from a mature LN infrastructure, though. In the meantime, why destroy zero-conf when double-spends are clearly not a widespread issue for those use cases (businesses) that currently rely on it?  After all, any rational actor would stop using it if it were such a big problem... right?
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:41:14
Coinbase, BitPay, and others already offer double-spend protection... so, what's the problem with zero conf again?
If you're worried about businesses that process their own bitcoin transactions, then it may be as simple as starting a "Double-spend Insurance Company" that covers losses at a reasonable rate.

You may be mostly correct about the root cause of the vitriol here, but I suspect it goes even deeper than that since nearly every "debated" subject in the world is consumed by hatred, paranoia, fear, extremism, and excessive hostility these days.
The world is going f'n loco, and it's obvious that these bitcoin subs are no exception.
The money involved simply acts as an amplifier.
Edit: also, for the record, I'm not claiming to be immune or above the fray. One of the biggest reasons I stopped actively participating is that this place started bringing out the worst in me, as well.
@_date: 2017-03-11 06:22:27
The big problem is market share (volume). The SEC is requiring that a certain percentage of it is done on exchanges they can effectively surveil.
Unfortunately, in terms of the ETF, the vast majority of global bitcoin traders tend to migrate to unregulated exchanges that are not under U.S. control.
I don't see that fact changing anytime soon, either.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:15:27
You're kidding yourself if you think this is the last chapter in the block size story.
If BU wins, the fight to implement SW and LN begins.
If Core wins, we're left with a 1MB+SW main chain that doesn't allow L2 solutions like LN to scale very well.
This saga will undoubtedly last several more years regardless of the immediate outcomes.

The 1.75x to 2x boost from SegWit is only a stop-gap solution, as well.
Unless they discover magical space compression in the next two years, we're still going to need a hard fork increase in MAXBLOCKSIZE, as well.
A mature LN infrastructure will also require *much* larger blocks than SW alone can give us.

The problem they (LE) had was that there weren't any laws applicable to most of the activities. Charges like "trespassing" and such were thrown out for obvious reasons (like never having left my bedroom). I was also a minor, so that worked strongly in my favor.
Ultimately, they had to settle for shutting down my bbs, and I also had to reimburse Telecom USA (a now defunct telco out of Georgia) for all the free long distance calls I made, as well as the cost of the equipment they apparently leased to trace me. I had written a program that went after their PBX's pretty intensely, and I hosted every tool on the planet on my BBS for several years, so I guess that annoyed them? LOL
I was only into the hacking and phreaking side of things. While my BBS hosted just about everything under the sun, those two activities were all I really cared about.
The grand total was only like $3k in fines/fees. Needless to say, though, my parents were just a tad pissed -- at them and me, both.
Since they dropped the charges, I never did find out whether my case was actually part of Op Sundevil, or not. It happened just after most of the Sundevil drama, and the Secret Service was involved, so I just always figured it was at least related. Or maybe somebody ratted me out? I never found out.
The whole story is pretty crazy -- involving threatened raids, torched disks and equipment, illegal interrogations, me running away from home, and my parents going apeshit on an agent -- but I figure the above covers the highlights. :)
Good times....

In the event of a split, the freshly dominant "JihamVer Coin" could use a tiny fraction of their newfound hash power to 51% attack and destroy your minority chain. 
Luckily, for you, Luke has already prepared an emergency hard fork that changes the Core hashing algorithm to prevent such an attack after a split. The bad news for you, though, is that the algorithm change would also make your old asics completely useless (which is the entire point of such an algorithm change). The entire lot of you would be forced to revert to GPU/CPU mining using the new algorithm.
Are you actually looking forward to starting over, completely, while the rest of the world moves on with JihamVer Coin and calls it "Bitcoin"?

Why is everyone conveniently forgetting that LN itself requires a much larger block size to operate at a large scale, as well? Global use of LN requires an estimated 133mb block size (7 billion people opening an average of 2 channels per year, and that's not even counting non-LN use of the main chain).
This is why there is a hard fork on Core's own roadmap following LN activation -- they apparently hope to discover a solution for much better on-chain scaling between now and then.
Are people simply ignoring this fact and hoping others don't pester Core about it later?
@_date: 2016-01-10 16:29:24

It's not. They simply follow all U.S. laws for KYC/AML, as they should, so a lot of anarchists think they've become the devil.
To be fair, Coinbase often goes a little overboard and is too invasive with their adherence to those laws; but, that's likely just a natural byproduct of their being under an intense microscope from regulators (because Bitcoin).

I don't think any of the exchanges meet the SEC's desired level of surveillance -- including those located in the U.S.
Their main issue is volume -- as in, those markets that are within their control do not possess enough market share (and liquidity) to identify, prevent, or mitigate manipulation done at any of the many unregulated exchanges throughout the world (in China and elsewhere).
Ironically, the exchanges in China may soon be even more regulated/compliant than those in the U.S.

For starters, governments absolutely DO confiscate property -- in fact, many of them, including the U.S., rely on said confiscation for their continued existence and authority. (See also: Taxation, Civil Asset Forfeiture, and Condemnation Proceedings)
Second, and perhaps more importantly, that's not why I'm here at all. You don't know a thing about me. 
Good luck "revolutionizing the global economy" without participants, like myself, who are actually doing the work to accomplish that. We all have our own reasons and motivations for participating -- some more altruistic than others -- but, gaining personal wealth isn't very high on my own list of goals in this experiment. At best, it would simply be an added or tangential perk.
Personally, I'm more interested in seeing the developing world join the global economy -- which would ultimately provide more education and production opportunities for those parts of the world that currently have very few options. Eventually, as a result of their newfound participation in the global economy, there may be less violence and struggle in those areas. I'd measure that outcome as a success.
Something tells me that people like myself have more in common with the Thiels of the world than you ever will.

The Core devs have promised a hard fork to increase block size after SW and LN -- it's on their published roadmap.
While they don't "need" one to make various other upgrades, they do still plan to use one to upgrade/raise block size, specifically.
I, for one, plan to hold them to that promise. After all, LN itself still requires a much larger on-chain block size to properly scale.
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:24:23

It begins with the assumption that literally everything, everywhere, is 100% pwned. So, now what? How do you still accomplish your task or mission in such a hostile environment?

The impact of a 2MB+SW hardfork can be controlled by slowly increasing the discount rate variable in SW over time.
In other words, the pace of progression from 2 to 8MB of data could be easily managed so that it doesn't outpace miner resources/capabilities.
The pace at which the discount rate increases could either be a) hardcoded in the initial hardfork using flag days, or b) subsequently rolled out via a series of scheduled softforks following the initial hardfork.
I suggested (and posted) this exact solution one year ago after several discussions with the Core, Classic, LN and SW devs, but Core chose to rush out the current SW softfork instead.
@_date: 2016-03-08 05:04:53

@_date: 2016-01-10 20:57:25


I'd argue that the SW soft fork will have the same effect, in terms of forcing everyone to upgrade. Any full node that fails to do so will no longer be providing **any** security to the Bitcoin network (or to themselves, obviously).
Either way, if a hard fork is recognized as inevitable, what do we gain from an extended or indefinite delay?

@_date: 2017-03-19 18:38:05
Actually, in using any acceptable definition of that term, yes. Yes it would.
After all, this patch would only be used if/when the Core chain becomes the minority chain, and therefore vulnerable to attack by the majority chain's miners. Said majority chain would likely assume the "Bitcoin" nomenclature in all relevant markets, thus absolutely making the new POW chain an altcoin with a new name.

Indeed. Then again, define "matters." Unless you're all about the zerohedge doomsday scenarios, such a development may always matter - in terms of long-term "legitimacy" in the first world.
I, for one, will stick around regardless of that definition or its ultimate acceptance by big government. But, are users like myself enough to sustain its utility (value) for decades or centuries to come?

It's been my understanding that they won't signal SW because they simply want BU *first*. Hell, even the Classic devs stated that they'd consider adding SW to their builds after the dust settled from their 2MB HF.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:30:25
I believe the current estimates are an average total of $350k in fees per day, divided accordingly amongst miners who win blocks.
Block rewards, using the 144 block/day average, currently have an average total of ~$1.8M per day, divided accordingly amongst miners who win blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:31:32
The size of the blocks in a 2MB+SW hardfork can be set to grow linearly over time by slowly increasing the Discount variable in SW. 
Example: it could start with Discount of 0% on day 1 and grow to a cap of 75% after three years (roughly 12.5% every 6 months, or X blocks). This would slowly increase the total blocksize from 2 to 8MB over that same 3 years, and it would cap at the same 75% discount value found in the SW softfork today.

My proposal did not involve an "eventually increasing blocksize."
My proposal involves a one-time blocksize increase to just 2MB and an "eventually increasing" discount variable for SW (up to a max of 75%, which is equal to the current SW softfork).
My proposal would act as a stop-gap compromise that gives everyone the time necessary to develop a more long-term blocksize hardfork in 3-5 years (in accordance with the current Core Roadmap).
My proposal was an actually tenable compromise that is technically very different from the "eventually increasing blocksize" proposal you're referring to.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:40:21
Agreed. It's poor practice, and I'd hope they don't repeat it.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:34:30
I think it's wrong for "core devs" to object to Gavin's specific implementation, but not the concept of raising the size itself, without presenting alternative code with a specific alternative implementation of their own.
If they don't like his code or method of increasing the size to 20MB next March, and then 40% each year after, where the hell are all of their alternative implementations after 3+ years of debate?!

The actual settlements (not individual trades) for the normal stock markets also frequently take several days to process.

First, as you know, the tx and witness data are sent separately -- totaling 4MB.
The tx data resides in the first 1,000,000 bytes.
Per the devs' own estimates last year, the discount will **realistically** provide for just 1.7x to 2x the number of tx found in our current standard 1MB blocks.
Using those figures, us peons commonly describe the results as essentially the equivalent of a standard (non-SW) 1.7MB to 2MB blocksize.
Regardless, none of this semantic nonsense takes away from the fact that you lied when you said above that "the community already rejected it."

That's not entirely correct. Their issue is that not enough volume occurs on regulated (read: controllable and surveilable) exchanges. Ironically, Gemini itself is highly regulated, compliant, and absolutely under government surveillance -- they alone simply don't have enough volume, though.

Ok, I see what you're getting at. However, I think your otherwise valid argument is too far ahead of its time.
Let's compare this to the browser wars. Microsoft was eventually forced by a court to allow alternative browsers to be set as default during the initial Windows install.  Users were allowed to choose an alternative browser *based on their own preferences after YEARS of exposure to the various options*.
That's simply not the case with Bitcoin and extremely cutting edge tools like Decentralized ID. It will likely be many years before it's understood by many CS students, let alone Joe Sixpack and his Grandma.
I mean, that much is obvious... I think?
I do agree with your overall point that Daniel probably shouldn't have taken sides so publicly, but I do not fault him for selecting a more secure **default setting** at this time (or in the near future when this is actually relevant).
Doing so is simply the responsible thing to do **at this point in time** (when hardly anyone on the planet even comprehends what the hell we're talking about...lol).
Perhaps Microsoft will someday offer users a choice during initial install. One prerequisite for that, though, is the existence of more than one **actually viable** option. That's definitely not the case with BU vs Core -- a decision that only includes one viable (and responsible) option.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:43:13


That is correct. I honestly cannot fathom why the devs -- who readily admitted that a hard fork to increase blocksize is inevitable -- didn't offer to combine a small increase + Segwit hard fork. 
Their objections always centered on the lead time required for a proper hard fork; and yet, here we are more than a year later with no measurable upgrade to speak of; which, coincidentally, is a result of that lack of compromise. That entire year could have been better spent preparing for a proper hard fork; and, ironically, the lead time requirement that most devs insisted on would have been met.
To top it all off, even Segwit itself would have been much cleaner using a hard fork. Combining the two seemed like a no-brainer to a lot of people, but stubbornness prevailed... and here we are.

SegWit is not a *replacement* for an actual increased blocksize, and it wouldn't equate to a 2x increase any time soon.
SW is still a great idea, though; so, I'm sure we'll see it merged with Classic once it's ready.
In a perfect world, we'd receive both in the same hard fork. Unfortunately, SW won't be ready for several more months.

One word: accumulation.
The buy and sell walls in place on all of the major exchanges are not "natural;" rather, they're intentional.  There are several parties currently accumulating thousands of coins in a very specific price range that they themselves are controlling on both sides (using both bid and ask walls).
That will end as soon as said parties meet their goals for accumulation.
The joys of having too many exchanges and not enough liquidity on any one of them...

The minority chain will quickly be destroyed if it doesn't immediately change its hashing algorithm to prevent attacks by the majority miners.
A change to the hashing algorithm -- using Luke's emergency hard fork patch created for exactly that purpose -- would force all miners on the minority chain to revert to CPU/GPU mining.
How does starting over sound to you? Do you think the minority chain could survive such a painful transition and still remain viable in the market?

One of the two systems requires what I refer to as Authority to Participate (ATP). Tell me again how such a system offers the same trustlessness as an Anyone Can Participate (ACP) system like Bitcoin?
It also all comes down to the incentive structure. What *new* incentives do participants in a non-POW ATP system have to remain honest when all previous legal and regulatory efforts to accomplish that have failed so miserably, and the only actual incentives to do so are those same legal and regulatory frameworks?
I have yet to see a private "blockchain" solution that properly handles the issue of incentives.
The incentive structure built into Bitcoin's POW system is arguably its most elegant feature.

The SECs objections aren't the sort that individual applicants can solve themselves.
In order to get an ETF approved, we would literally need to coordinate and upgrade the entire exchange ecosystem to adhere to the strict requirements laid out in the SEC's ruling, and the vast majority of traders would need to migrate to fully regulated exchanges within the SEC's regulatory reach.
Short of that, the SEC will continue to view the global Bitcoin markets as uncontrollable and unregulated entities that can be easily manipulated without detection or recourse... and they wouldn't even be wrong.

The differences are NOT subtle, though. In this version, they would have been *committing* to a hard fork; whereas, in the actual road map they released, there's no such *commitment*. The original was very ambiguous and left the door wide open for never doing another hard fork.
That's not a "subtle" difference at all...

You're (mistakenly) assuming that there are not already some very interesting, and potentially very popular, use cases waiting in the wings for the scaling issues to get resolved.
Something like Lightning Network could cause popularity to explode overnight once it's possible to have a nearly infinite number of transactions that are (ultimately) secured and facilitated by the blockchain.
Need I remind you that, just yesterday, we learned that Microsoft's Head of Decentralized Identity casually remarked about installing a Bitcoin SPV capability over **one billion** PC's? He also mentioned that more information would be made available on May 22nd of this year.
At the end of the day, genuine mass adoption will occur once Bitcoin itself operates silently (aka "invisibly") in the background of apps that "regular" consumers use every day.  If/when that happens, it will happen VERY quickly, and we had better be prepared.
@_date: 2016-01-16 01:06:51

There actually is/was already space set aside in every block for low/no fee transactions, and most miners included such transactions in their blocks. More importantly, and perhaps ironically, there was no threat to removing that "free space" until we began to approach the arbitrary and now infamous 1MB limit.

@_date: 2016-01-29 14:55:49
Possibly. However, I'd suggest the hard fork occur prior to the development of weak blocks so that the increased blocksize informs the development of those, rather than the other way around.
My preferred (suggested) development roadmap would be:  
SegWit -&gt; hard fork -&gt; IBLT -&gt; weak blocks.

It most certainly is performing well, in terms of its value versus other currencies -- which just so happens to be how the performance of currencies is measured in global markets.

You are correct, but that's not relevant to my original question for Greg.
I was asking him his thoughts on the quality of the 2mb code, specifically -- which, in case you didn't know, wasn't just a small change to one variable. Gavin's solution was slightly more complex than that and solved more than one issue, so I'm interested in hearing Greg's opinion -- again, of the code itself.
Just something I've been curious about for a while...

We all know how open source software works.
The fact of the matter is that several of the most prominent Core devs committed to developing a 2MB hard fork pull request for Core itself, and the large miners they made that promIse to are looking for said code.

There will be no deep meaning or insight in the movements and prices of these tokens.

A true Fedcoin would require throughput so far beyond the current potential number of tx -- even with Segwit -- that saying they "probably need other tech" is the understatement of the year.

That doesn't work without additional changes. The *Scale_Factor* would need to be reduced from 4 to 2 (aka 1/2) in order to then reduce *MaxBlockWeight* to 4MB in SegWit2x. (This changes discount from 75% to 50%)
The "Base" size itself is actually just a factor of *MaxBlockWeight/Scale_Factor*, so it would have to become 4/2 instead of the SegWit and SegWit2x current setting (scale factor=4, or 1/4) that result in 4/4=1 and 8/4=2, respectively.
It's not coded that way, but that's how the Discount and scaling work in practice.

It's quite possible that exceptionally high on-chain fees could prevent poor people from ever using LN, as well.

I personally view it as an upgrade/update to the current consensus layer.
You're free to disagree, of course.
Core is also free to code and release a compatible client if they wish. If they elect to change the PoW for their version of the client instead, that's fine too.
There are no guns being held to anyone's head. Everyone has the freedom to choose the direction(s) they wish to go before, during, or after the fork.

SegWit2x is not something created by, or pushed by, "the miners." There are more than 80 NYA signatories at this point, and only a handful of those are miners.
No single NYA signatory has any extra or undue influence over SegWit2x development, either.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:58:46
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:46:06
I don't know that one.
The one I'm referring to was simply "Expect." 
It was a one-word statement made in the Trading View chat box by a mysterious whale named "Benjamin" who used to have inside knowledge of all the major manipulations across the markets.  
The market shot up shortly after he posted that single word (or dropped dramatically, I can't remember which), so traders started responding with "Expect" every time someone asked about the price. 
The meme actually had a rather long life, so anyone who hung around the main trading channels in 2013-2014 may remember it. :)

There is no EDA in SegWit2x, and the blocks will only reach ~4MB after all transactions are SegWit transactions -- which may not happen for another year, or longer.

I believe you're mistakenly assuming that all changes outside this tiny echo-chamber are "unwanted."
The ability for any/all proposed changes to occur using Bitcoin's inherent consensus system is a feature, not a bug.
Unlike this sub, Bitcoin itself doesn't care who proposes the changes.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:11:59
That's happening right now, as well. In fact, most of the team's energy is currently being spent on helping all signatories and users prepare their systems and services for the update.
There are also many third-party and SPV wallet services that will automatically follow the SegWit2x fork without any additional changes. A lot of thought was put into ensuring broad compatibility and limited disruption -- at least *as much as possible* given the fact that Core is sitting this one out.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:34:41

SegWit2x does not result in blocks that exceed the Cornell recommendations. In fact, SegWit2x won't even reach ~4MB until most/all transactions are SegWit transactions -- which may be another year, or longer.
The limited code changes in SegWit2x are very well-tested and running great on both testnet5 and main net.
I don't think you realize just how simple and straightforward the changes are.

The super majority of miners and markets *do* define what is globally recognized and referenced as the consensus layer for Bitcoin. 
If a user chooses to run something that doesn't agree with said consensus layer, that is entirely up to them, but it doesn't change what is otherwise known and referenced globally as Bitcoin's consensus layer.
That just means you're running an altcoin.

Those "few businesses (20%)" you keep referring to are some of the largest in the space and account for:  
* ~50% of economic productivity in the space (an estimated $5.1 Billion annually).  
* Interface with, or provide direct services to, an estimated 90% of ALL Bitcoin users.  
* Provide merchant services to more than 90% of ALL merchants who accept Bitcoin.  
* The obvious 85+% of total Bitcoin hashpower.  
But yeah, sure, I guess you can just continue to belittle their reach, import, and impact...makes total sense to me. /s

I'd suggest r/btc, for starters, but it's extremely difficult to find the rare SegWit2x posts amidst all the Bitcash drivel and other nonsense.
Are you able to understand code and other technical aspects of the discussion? If so, you may wish to check out the lengthy discussions on BTC1's github repo.
I can probably help answer any specific questions you may have. You can also go through my post and comment histories for a lot of various info on SegWit2x. (I've written a few original posts that contained summaries of SegWit2x details and technical specs).
One of the greatest challenges has been putting out real info about SegWit2x on social media that are filled to the brim with anti-SegWit2x FUD. It's extremely difficult to have honest discussions about it in this sub, for instance, or on Twitter.
Again, though, please feel free to ask me any specific questions you may have. Good luck!

There are now more than 80 signatories to the NYA that inspired the development of SegWit2x, and only a handful of those are miners.
There are many very large non-mining businesses and countless users who also support SegWit2x.
And finally, replay protection is not necessary for the Bitcoin chain with the most hashpower -- which, if all NYA signatories remain committed, will absolutely be the SegWit2x chain.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:00:43
I'm aware of some of those theories and plans, and using Litecoin as the on-ramp is actually a fantastic workaround to Bitcoin's high fees -- at least for a while.
That does beg the question, though, "why not stick with LTC on LN instead of getting onto LN and swapping  to BTC?"
That said, I sincerely hope the less fortunate around the world aren't forced into third party services of any kind due to high on-chain fees, as that would destroy half of the reason I've been interested in Bitcoin all these years.
I'm optimistic, as well, but I simply no longer have faith in all of Core's decisions.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:29:23
That's the plan.
However, that's mainly due to the fact that Core refuses to release a 2x-compatible client. If they did so, I'm sure the vast majority of users would install it tomorrow -- even many of those who have supported the BTC1 team's efforts on SegWit2x from day one.

Nobody was misinformed.

They'll do the same for anyone who approaches them directly for assistance.
Many volunteers have been spending a good deal of time handling that part of the update, and the devs are reachable on their Slack channel almost every day.

You could easily do what he's suggesting if you reduce to the Discount to 50% instead of 75%.
It's simply a matter of setting *SCALE_FACTOR* = 2 (instead of 4), and *MaxBlockWeight* = 4M (instead of 8M).  
However, the NYA participants insisted on maintaining all of the SegWit variables set by Core in order to meet the standards of the charter to the letter, which includes maintaining the 75% Discount variable (aka SCALE_FACTOR).

No transactions will "move" to LN. The type of low-value transactions LN is designed for are not happening on the current chain due to fees making them cost-prohibitive.
In other words, LN transactions will primarily be those that have *already* been removed from the main chain.
For that reason, a successful LN will actually result in an *increase* of on-chain transactions to open and close channels, not a decrease.

I'll repeat them one time just for you:

The miners make up only a very small handful of the now 80+ NYA signatories, and none of the signatories has any extra influence or control over SegWit2x development itself.
Therefore, calling the NYA a "Miners' agreement" is just bullshit FUD.
Don't let pesky little things like facts get the way, though...
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:50:36


The SegWit2x changes involve *less than* 500 lines of new or modified code, and there will be a total of 4+ months of testing prior to the hardfork itself.
I've personally been auditing the code and testing the client, along with many others, since June -- on both testnet5 and main net.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:52:43
All developers are free to continue contributing to Bitcoin development after the SegWit2x update.
Hell, Core itself is free to release a compatible client if they wish. There's nothing stopping them from doing so (except, perhaps, their own stubborn pride).
Freedom is cool.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:36:13
Once all exchanges and services designate the updated SegWit2x chain as "Bitcoin," your adding of the word "valid" to the *actual* definition spelled out in the original whitepaper will be meaningless.
The chain with the most accumulated Difficulty/Hashpower that is marketed as "Bitcoin" throughout the entire industry will be Bitcoin. Period.
For better or worse, there's no amount of foot stomping or grumbling that can prevent that from occurring, either.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:56:40
I'm sorry, but is there scientific experiment going on in this *social media discussion thread* that I'm not aware of?
My bad.
I still submit that there are a very large number of users who support SegWit2x, and that said number isn't something that can easily be quantified. Hence, the number is *countless*.

@_date: 2017-08-18 06:46:23
If Core is forced to release an emergency PoW change in order to save the legacy chain, many nodes (users) may elect to install SegWit2x instead of Core's new PoW client.
For that reason, I suspect every node operator in the entire system will likely need to make a conscious choice sometime in November; and, contrary to what many here may believe, the odds aren't *automatically* in Core's favor for the eventual outcome.

I wasn't referring to Layer 2.
Layer 1 will also require a more permanent solution for blocksize scaling. It will likely be dynamic/deterministic in nature.
This is known.
We also wouldn't "be there by now," because the scaling debate and delays aren't the reason Lightning itself isn't ready yet. 
Both testnet and alt coins have been available for full Lightning development and testing for quite some time. However, there are still some very difficult mechanics issues that none of the Lightning teams have been able to overcome yet (ie. multi-hop routing).
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:43:18
Miners comprise only a small handful of the 80+ signatories to the NYA, and said signatories provide services of one sort or another to an estimated 90+% of all bitcoin-accepting merchants AND users.
No single signatory has any special or undue influence over SegWit2x development.
It's actually a true compromise with broad industry and user support, not something cooked up by "the miners" to take over Bitcoin. That's pure FUD bullshit.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:54:22


I do not oppose it.

@_date: 2017-08-19 22:32:38
They were actually 3.7MB, but they'd also be highly unlikely/unnatural/expensive on main net.
An attack block on SegWit2x would require an easily recognizable (and easily ignored by miners) construction that contains almost 6 MB of just witness data.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:17:50
Most LN implementations are still in beta or alpha. I'm not entirely sure that any of them have solved the online/offline and multi-hop routing issues yet.

@_date: 2017-08-19 08:27:33


That narrative doesn't fly when everyone already knows that the **real world results** are ~2MB and ~4MB for SegWit and SegWit2x, respectively -- and even these low figures are only likely once *all* transactions utilize SegWit.

Two things:  
1. I'm certainly invested in BTC. Not only do I own a non-trivial amount, I also consult on the subject for a living. I've obviously invested a large portion of my time, energy, and money in Bitcoin.
2. SegWit2x is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:40:41
I believe SegWit2x is a long overdue and reasonable compromise that includes a worthwhile (and rightfully limited) upgrade to the Bitcoin consensus layer. I believe it will benefit everyone -- miners, businesses, traders, users, and developers alike.
[It's also almost exactly what I proposed as a compromise in January 2016]( so I've personally felt this way for a very long time.

Worst case scenarios in SegWit2x require specially crafted tx with a full 6MB of just witness data. Do you understand how complex and expensive such tx would be? Not to mention the fact that such transactions would be instantly recognisable, thus allowing miners to completely ignore them if they wish.
Even today, Luke still says misleading things like "SegWit is already 2MB, but SegWit2x is 8MB!" That statement obviously cherry picks the values for each version. He did so in this very thread...
@_date: 2016-06-15 00:18:36


It's no different than any other currency in that regard, and most *economists* understand exactly what someone is referring to when they say "the U.S. Dollar is performing well versus other currencies."
They're not going to mistake that to mean that it's *functioning* well compared to other currencies. They'll rightfully understand it to mean that it's maintaining its value (or "buying power") well versus other currencies in the Forex markets.
Don't act smarter than everyone here. You're not.

I believe there are currently over 80 signatories to the NYA, and growing.
Miners are just a small handful of those.

SW's discount rate can easily be leveraged to govern the pace at which the increases occur.
Example:  
A 2MB+SW hard fork could limit data transmission between 2 to 8MB over a three year time period, at +X% intervals, while still gaining the tx malleability fix in SW on day 1.
I've written about this solution several times during the last year, and even approached the SW devs requesting their help with a BIP.
All of my efforts fell on deaf developer ears. They're just not listening, and I personally don't have the skills required to code it myself.

The costs of added bandwidth and storage relative to block reward ROI, of course.
The larger BU miners simply set their EB/AD above the acceptable limits of their smaller competitors and wait for them to die off one at a time. The end result is a much smaller (and more easily controlled) network of large miners and nodes.

How would it be "not as covert"? There's still no way to detect its use if they simply continue mining legacy blocks.
Suspicions may be more well founded at that point, but it's use won't be any less covert.

That makes no sense. Their support is for the plan that includes the hardfork. It won't be "away from Bitcoin," though, as SegWit2x will itself become the new reference client *for* Bitcoin.
If every supporting business advises their users to properly prepare for the SegWit2x update, will Theymoa remove them?

Does your local grocery store call you for approval when they make business decisions on behalf of all of their customers?
The signatories represent businesses who directly interface with, or provide direct services to, an estimated 90% of ALL Bitcoin users. The decisions they make are made with what they consider their customers' best interests in mind, as well as their own -- which is exactly what every customer-centric business on the planet does (like your grocery store).
If you're a customer, you could voice your displeasure and leave.
If you're not a customer of any signatory, then your only real recourses are to vote with your mining power, sell or trade your holdings on the market, or stick around doing nothing at all until the dust settles.

You're misquoting me to prove a different point that I wasn't addressing in my post above. My post was about the need for replay protection, not what is called "bitcoin."
I happen to agree with your statement.
However, I also consider SegWit2x "valid blocks," just as most/all of the industry will do the same after November 21st.
SegWit2x is not controlled "by the miners," either. In fact, not a single mining entity has any unique or extra control over its development.
The NYA has now been signed by 80+ individuals and businesses in the industry, and it has the support of countless users throughout the entire community.
Only a handful of those signatories are miners... but, they do just happen to control nearly all Bitcoin mining. That's more a problem with centralized mining, in general, than anything to do with the NYA or SegWit2x.

You misunderstand. The companies that signed the NYA account for more than 50% of the economic productivity in the entire Bitcoin space -- an estimated $5.1 Billion annually, if I'm not mistaken.
They are also the businesses which provide services to more than 90% (estimated) of all users, so they have the most to lose or gain, in terms of user experience and opinions, on the SegWit2x upgrade itself.


I submit that you're probably very incorrect in that assumption, and that the vast (silent) supermajority of Bitcoin users either a) support the SegWit2x upgrade, b) don't know the difference, or c) don't give a shit either way.
Please revisit the numbers and points I made above concerning THE largest user-facing companies in the space who have elected to support SegWit2x. They collectively represent that estimated 90% of users that they provide services for, and they have decided that SegWit2x is the right move for their users. (Business 101 stuff here).
There's currently no other way to measure user sentiment on this specific issue. I suspect that you're paying way too much attention to the troll armies here in this sub and on Twitter, though. Try stepping outside the chamber perhaps, or at least step back to revisit this issue rationally given the points I've made above?

Prior to the implementation of the "temporary" 1MB limit, a block larger than 1MB was *possible.* The code "allowed" for it to happen, but it simply never did.

There have been issues developing the algorithms/mechanics necessary to establish "path discovery," which would be the process used to establish longer on-the-fly multi-hop paths between any sender and recipient -- especially when any node along a path can go on and offline at will, thus causing route failure.
AFAIK, most of the implementations are still limited to *direct* sender-to-recipient channels and/or 2-hop paths that route through a shared centralized hub, but I could be wrong.
Edit:  Great news, I was wrong about the current state of LN dev!  See below. :)

The chain with the higher hashpower doesn't need replay protection. If SegWit2x maintains 80+%, that would be the longest chain with the most hashpower. And, that just may become globally recognized as Bitcoin.
Core should probably consider adding it, though. 
Then again, their upcoming PoW/Difficulty hardfork will also address that issue, so no worries.

That narrative doesn't fly when everyone already knows that the **real world results** are ~2MB and ~4MB for SegWit and SegWit2x, respectively -- and even these low figures are only likely once *all* transactions utilize SegWit.

I don't want to "fire" anyone either. Everyone is free to still contribute to Bitcoin development after the update, and any/all contributions would be welcomed by everyone.

Because freedom is cool.

I do not believe that evidence supports your argument, and I suspect there is much more business AND user support for SegWit2x than you currently believe.
Coinbase and Bitpay alone account for more than 90% of global merchant adoption, and the NYA signatories include many of the the largest user-facing businesses in the space. 
The signatories also collectively account for more than $5.1 Billion in annual economic productivity in the space, which is itself roughly 50% of said productivity.
I'm not ashamed of my support for the SegWit2x compromise at all, so your attempts to shame me for it are unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:13:31
The SegWit2x hardfork may take 85+% of the Bitcoin hashpower, versus the Bitcash hardfork that merely took ~5-10%. 
The SegWit2x effort also includes several user-facing businesses that have played a fairly large role in this space, such as both Bitpay and Coinbase.

There is more than one competent developer working on SegWit2x. I've even contributed a little myself, and I'd like to think of myself as competent.
However, there is currently a feature freeze until after the fork. (For what I should think are obvious reasons)
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:02:05
Perhaps. Perhaps not.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:52:12
For now.
Once Core is forced to release a PoW change to save the legacy chain, and all Core nodes are subsequently forced to install a new client, I think you'll find that many node operators may just install the SegWit2x client at that time instead of the new Core PoW client.
That said, with only ~100k listening and non-listening nodes, it's obvious that nodes themselves represent only a very small portion of the total Bitcoin user base.
The vast majority of users rely on light clients (SPV) or third-parties (like Coinbase), and the vast majority of those will follow the SegWit2x chain without any/many changes whatsoever.

@_date: 2017-08-22 17:10:03
Adding *mandatory* replay protection would break compatibility with most light clients/wallets; thus having them default to Core, rather than correctly following the longest Bitcoin chain.
This is a) the main reason Core supporters want SegWit2x to add replay protection, and b) obviously not optimal for SegWit2x migration.
That said, the BTC1 has repeatedly stated that they're willing to consider OPT-IN replay protection, which is why the issue ( has remained *open* for over a month now on their repo.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:38:00
And they're also supporting SegWit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:28:36

Core signatures and support are not required for SegWit2x to succeed.
That would certainly be nice, but they're not required.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:19:14
The NYA signatories are running, or will run, their own SegWit2x nodes prior to November 21st (if their business requires such nodes).
It's up to users to update their own nodes whenever they wish to do so -- before, during, or after the hardfork.
Are you suggesting that all of the supporting companies should spin up a bunch of extra nodes in a datacenter for no apparent reason or benefit?
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:55:00
Well then, I guess it's a good thing that SegWit and SegWit2x will result in blocks that are *actually* only ~2MB and ~4MB under real world conditions, correct?

What if I told you that the *primary* reason "nodes don't update that fast" at the moment is simply Core's refusal to support the compromise?
If Core supported this simple upgrade, a flag day between November and January wouldn't be a problem *at all*.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:52:34
The primary focus is currently on assisting all NYA signatories and users with their preparedness for the update itself.
Greg, I respect you a lot, I really do. I've learned a lot from you over the years. However, please do not presume to know or dictate some sort of one correct way to handle development.
SegWit2x itself was designed to address one very simple and specific charter with exactly two parts:  1) SegWit Activation, and 2) an increase to 2MB for "base size" (or whatever the hell someone wants to call the space allocated for legacy tx and non-witness data).
That's it. 
After the hardfork, any/all ideas will be welcomed, considered, coded, reviewed, tested, etc. -- including a likely port of anything interesting or useful in Core 0.15 (sans your wonderful little anti-SegWit2x peering changes, of course).
It is what it is. One way, or another, the system Satoshi himself invented will itself resolve this entire issue in late November. Everything else is just noise.

I honestly don't care if he is. The success or failure of the entire effort isn't based on the beliefs or commitment of any one signatory.

I believe he may be asking for an increase in supply to better match demand, thus potentially lowering the price (fees) so that lower-income users are not priced out of the market altogether.
It's a reasonable desire -- especially if the overall goal of the project is to increase the number of potential users, rather than decrease the number of potential users.

*Total Block Weight* is arguably the new total "block size" measurement, as it's the total size (in bytes) of the entire SegWit block.

Caution is not a bad ideal, as everything in this space is still risky. The short timeframe initially had me very concerned, as well.

@_date: 2017-08-21 07:28:52
The primary goal of the increase in SegWit2x is to provide everyone a little additional time to discover and implement a more permanent/dynamic/deterministic solution for on-chain scaling, not to simply double it every few years.
In other words, like SegWit by itself, it's just a slightly larger stop-gap solution that provides slightly more time for research and development of a more permanent solution.
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:16:28


It's not a full replacement. It's actually a rather small change that loosens the consensus rules to allow for larger blocks. The "loosening" of the rules is what makes it a hardfork.


The lack of replay protection is not what forces nodes to upgrade their clients. The actual reasons to upgrade the clients are either:  
A) to update to the new SegWit2x consensus layer, or   
B) to update to Core's new PoW client.  
I plan to run one of each client for the exact same reason I run SegWit2x, BitcoinClassic(Cash), Electrum-LTC, and ParityETH now -- to have one wallet on each chain. I will add Core's new client with the PoW change to the mix after they release it.

@_date: 2017-08-25 03:59:38


The low-value transactions in the LN itself are already too expensive to do on-chain, so they're already *not* a part of the congestion; and, for that reason, LN will *not* result in fewer on-chain transactions.
Instead, a successful LN will actually result in *more* on-chain transactions, not fewer. The increase will be a result of old and new users continuously opening and closing an ever-increasing number of LN channels.

You're not getting it.
The entire industry, miners, AND countless users will collectively "dictate the rules" by embracing the updated rules included in SegWit2x.
Contrary to what some arrogant parties would have you believe, the SegWit2x update has MUCH broader support throughout the *entire Bitcoin community* than just miners.
The "miners dictating everything and taking over" narrative is complete and total horseshit meant to cause anger and hostility -- in that regard, it's *even worse* than FUD.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:44:28

SegWit2x is not "Chinacoin" -- that would be Bitcash.
SegWit2x has more than 80+ industry signatories, and counting, and the Chinese mining cartel has no more influence over its development than any of the other signatories.

The client is already fully functional on both mainnet and testnet5. I agree that the compressed schedule is too short, but the entire diff for SegWit2x (from Core 0.14.2) involves less than 500 lines of new or modified code -- including tests.
It's not a very complex change, so 3+ months of testing should be sufficient.


In reality, the blocks won't surpass 2MB with regular SegWit for a very long time (Luke agrees), and the same is true of 4MB with SegWit2x.
I wholeheartedly believe that the current network can handle 4MB blocks with little or no impact on decentralization. Various academic/industry studies have supported this prediction, as well.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:39:16


Two things:  1) The chain with the most hashpower doesn't require replay protection, and 2) the longest chain with the most valid work is Bitcoin.


SegWit2x is not being forced by "the miners." There are many miners, businesses, AND users who fully support the NYA and SegWit2x update to the consensus layer.
The "miners forcing it" nonsense is a false and misleading narrative.

My "only complaints" would be that the mod team here is quite obviously biased and overzealous in their efforts to "clean up."
I don't see anyone who repeatedly says "Jeffcoin" to demean the SegWit2x effort getting banned.
Hell, I'm nervous about getting banned simply for having this civil conversation with you on the subject of moderation, and that shouldn't be the case *at all*.
It absolutely sucks that every last one of us who has a different opinion than the mods has to feel that way every single time we post in this sub -- and I'm *not* talking about trollish posts. Every time I write a civil post in support of SegWit2x that contains straightforward data or information, I still hold my breath waiting for the ban hammer to fall, and I won't even be surprised when it happens.

You didn't get margin called at 160. Bitfinex only got down as low as 162, and most margin calls below 200 didn't even get executed (according to the bitfinex CEO, Phil Potter, who spoke with us in the whaleclub TS after the dump today). Mr. Potter said that their system froze margin calls below a certain point so as to let the market rebound above 200, which it did just minutes later.
Had every margin call below 200 been executed, we may have seen it get closer to 100 in the flash.

**I'll just repost my other response here...**
Actually, t0 appears to have developed two distinct solutions (that work together). 
The first is simply a system (or engine) that uses the actual Bitcoin blockchain to facilitate trading and settlement, thus potentially replacing the current systems used by the likes of NASDAQ and NYSE.
The second solution -- which appears to be the one they've partnered with PeerNova to develop -- is for stock loaning, specifically; thus potentially replacing the traditional stock loan facilitators (ie. banks, brokerages).
It looks like he's attempting to merge both "types" of blockchains -- both public and "permissioned" -- into one cohesive system.
Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they somehow (eventually) peg the second solution (the permissioned chain) to the Bitcoin blockchain itself using sidechains, or something similar. (Or using something even simpler, like OP_RETURN). This seems like a great use for t0's new "asset addresses."
**tl;dr** - T0 has created two distinct, but related, solutions -- one that uses public ledgers (ie. Bitcoin), *and* one that attempts to use private (or "permissioned") ledgers in partnership with PeerNova. The first is for straight trading and settlement, while the second is for stock loaning, specifically (ie. lending and borrowing stocks to short sell them).

I know exactly what the "point" is, and it does not change the fact that the main chain tps must also dramatically increase.


Their effect is not "just like" that of a Bitcoin blocksize increase at all. With a main chain increase, there are no sacrifices in terms of security, accessibility, and compatibility.
I don't want to get into this here; but, suffice to say, SC and LN do not negate the need for a Bitcoin blocksize increase. Their existence may reflect in a slightly smaller future cap, but not on the immediate need for a reasonable increase today.

Perhaps using something like Shapeshift to go from:

Are you sure it's not theoretically possible for a SC coin to surpass the price/value of Bitcoin? And, if that happens, the users of said SC may simply stay on that SC forever?

I was referring to the use of that date as the base value for determining any increase/decrease -- just as you could/would do with any stock and its IPO value.

The problem is that many large holders of Bitcoin mined it very early, so some actually have very little "skin" in the game.

That's absolutely true. He also said that it would only take a few weeks of coding to add each new ledger to the system. I imagine that they'll do so based on the requests and requirements of each client -- many of which will likely utilize more than one chain for their intended use cases.
Bitcoin alone -- using something similar to colored coins -- will be the answer for some, but not all.
The good news is that, based on my experiments with their newly released online explorer tool, their new *asset address* system has already been integrated with the Bitcoin blockchain. :)

My analysis is based on several articles and statements Patrick Byrne (and others) have made in the last several months. The Wired article today actually describes the two distinct solutions, but you have to read it very carefully to notice and understand the distinction. If you read what I wrote above and then go back and read the Wired article with my info in mind, you should be able to pick it out.
There's also the new online block explorer T0 has. They've created something called an *asset address* that is actually linked to, or simply associated with, every possible Bitcoin address. I believe their new asset addresses are the key to both solutions, as they will likely work with various blockchains individually, interchangeably, or perhaps even simultaneously.
It's all pretty fascinating; but, trust me, Patrick Byrne has not "sold out" in any way. He's still very much a supporter of all things Bitcoin, and T0's new solutions will actually reflect that fact once they're better understood by everyone -- including me.

There is a large difference between "working with legislators" to educate/lobby them and inviting them to add requirements to the code itself.  The former is completely reasonable, while the latter would be a travesty.
I'm fairly confident that Gavin and Mike both know the difference; and, since XT is open source, it's not like they can sneak government-inspired code past everyone in the dark of night.
"Working with legislators" is perfectly fine as long as it doesn't influence the code itself.

The current small block size may soon change Bitcoin from the electronic cash system that Satoshi created into a settlement network reserved for large businesses and the ultra-wealthy. That, to me, indicates that it's actually small block advocacy that is "antithetical to the currency."

The problem with that strategy is that some participants (ie. Merchants) aren't likely to "freak out" and leave any particular payment processor (hub).
What happens if you go to a store that only connects to, or accepts payments through, one particular Lightning hub? What if that hub service requires AML/KYC for all tx?
@_date: 2015-08-05 06:25:08

That's the entire rub. If the block size is kept small, block space scarcity may lead to miner fees that are too high for normal users.
The result may be a main blockchain that is reserved for banks, large businesses (like LN hub companies?), and the ultra-wealthy.
That's not the global "electronic cash" system that Satoshi envisioned and most of us signed up for...

At the end, he alluded to their first "primary partner" being a blockchain, but refused to say which one.

@_date: 2015-08-18 16:05:27


I don't recall anyone ever suggesting that all tx should be "free," so that statement strikes me as hyperbole.  


Perhaps work on creating more incentives to run full nodes instead of, or in conjunction with, developing off-chain solutions?
I primarily disagree with your assumption that *"most people would be fine with using sidechains, off-chain transactions and the Lightning Network for most transactions."*
The moment that using non-Bitcoin alternatives becomes noticeably cheaper is the moment we lose one of Bitcoin's biggest (and most important) benefits -- especially when doing so also comes at the cost of reduced privacy.
I find it very ironic that some hope to protect/enhance Bitcoin's decentralization by promoting a much more centralized off-chain solution (LN).
I only ask that people re-read the *title* of Satoshi's white paper until it sinks in. The meaning of the words "electronic cash" appears lost on too many these days.
I agree to wholeheartedly disagree...
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:39:55
Didn't he say that it would only take a few weeks of coding to add any new ledger?
I'm pretty sure the new "asset address" system they created is the key, and that each asset address can probably be associated with an address on any blockchain.
Not enough info yet, but I really do think they'll make it possible to link the assets to/on any blockchain. Hell, they'll probably even release APIs to do so at some point.

You answered your own question. The "signal" for supporting XT is whether or not they run the XT code, period.
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:31:38


That's not entirely accurate. Colored coins (or any variation thereof) can represent any asset and do NOT rely on the underlying value of Bitcoin being equal to the value of said assets.
One Satoshi could **represent** a house, car, or stock certificate while still being practically worthless in terms of U.S. Dollars.
It is true, though, that bitcoins having *some* value is what allows the entire system to function; however, none of those other uses for the Bitcoin blockchain will "derive" their *value* from bitcoin -- instead, they'll simply derive their *functionality* from bitcoins having value.
Make sense?

It is my contention that we haven't seen either... yet. 
We have also been recovering/stabilizing from the advent of both ASICs and SPV wallets -- which are the primary reasons we've experienced a dramatic drop in full nodes for the last 24+ months.
Real exponential growth in adoption hasn't even begun. The vast majority of potential users and businesses are still trying to figure out wtf Bitcoin is and how it works. Once the snowball actually starts rolling, though, you'll know...
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:04:14
I'd prefer to see the same or similar merged into Core (BIP101 perhaps?), but I switched my nodes to XT because it's the only way normal users can "vote" for larger blocks right now.
I support larger blocks because I signed up for an electronic *cash* system, not an electronic *settlement* system. **(See also: the f'n title of Satoshi's white paper).**

Yes and no. I agree with what you've written for its accuracy, but it's not actually the point I was trying to make above. 
While often functionally similar in their utility and consequence, unintentional bugs and nefarious code are two different issues. I feel that Bitcoin devs have done an excellent job of preventing the latter thanks to a decent number of eyes on the code at all times (and since most Bitcoin PR's seem to be smaller single-issue patches rather than hundreds of thousands of lines of new code).
Make sense?

Those freshly minted coins that were rewarded directly to a Gox address (from Eligius, perhaps) were too young to spend; so, allegedly, that's what caused the extreme backlog of stuck TX in January 2014 when Mark's poorly coded system tried to fund withdrawals using those baby coins instead of older coins.
We were able to see the TX that tried to use the baby-fresh coins at the time, so I do personally believe that this is what caused the stuck TX problem -- at least partially.

AFAIK, this wasn't the type of spam Satoshi had in mind when he implemented the cap. I think he was more worried about miners themselves creating/filling very large blocks in an attempt to cause problems for other miners.

**Willy itself NEVER bought bitcoins at any sort of premium, let alone 10%.**  Willy bought 10-19 coins every 5-10 minutes *from the top of the spread* and never paid anything more than a few pennies above the Gox market price for them.
Unless you're referring to the Gox premium itself? in that case, Willy paid the same "premium" as every other trader on Gox. There was certainly an arbitrage opportunity if they were sold elsewhere -- especially if they were purchased with fake fiat to begin with -- but, to say (or imply) that Willy bought them at any sort of Willy-specific premium is completely inaccurate.
Also, Willy continued to operate into January 201 -- well after the PBOC shut down the chinese exchange accounts.  
My guess is that the arb was happening elsewhere -- Bitstamp and even Bitfinex were also viable options. You could basically arb them everywhere other than Gox, not just in China.

The point is that if the fees grow too large due to artificial block space scarcity, the entire system will be reduced to a **settlement network** that only large businesses and the wealthy can afford to use.
That's practically the opposite of what Satoshi intended, and it's also the opposite of what most of us invested our blood, sweat, tears, and money in for the last six years.

Sorry to disappoint, but the advent of sidechains has very little bearing on the blocksize debate. I believe that the number of tps on the main chain must still dramatically increase, regardless of SC, LN, or any other off-chain or third-party solution. The current blocksize simply can't handle much more adoption if we hope to maintain Satoshi's promise of P2P electronic cash, period.
The two-way peg, real-world application, and potential benefits of sidechains are still evolving. Granted, I could/should have spent more time exploring Elements and the SC whitepaper; but still, I don't feel it has much bearing on the other (arguably more important) debate.
My questions here are a result of my spending very little time studying the SC concepts, specifically.  I admit that.

That has nothing to do with the initial consensus required amongst core devs when deciding what code gets merged into Bitcoin Core -- which is especially important when dealing with the consensus aspects of the code itself.
When monkeying with the consensus aspect of the code itself, the opinions and  requirements of the entire ecosystem must be considered, not just the miners.
Edit: While it's true that the miners will ultimately decide through consensus which chain we call Bitcoin, the initial decision of what code to merge into the Core software requires a different kind of consensus that involves consideration of the entire ecosystem, not just the miners.

He said several things that lead me to believe that their asset tracking and settlement system is designed to eventually work with all blockchains, not just Bitcoin.
That could be the reason they've created a new "asset address" that is associated with a specific Bitcoin address. That same asset address could possibly become associated with addresses on other blockchains, as well... maybe?
I'm just guessing at this point...

If it's approved, the COIN ETF will trade independently on NASDAQ, not Gemini.

I get that. However, what other options will there be if/when increased miner fees make using Bitcoin itself cost prohibitive for normal users and otherwise normal tx?

Most importantly, if you check out their online block explorer, the unique "asset addresses" are already linked to Bitcoin addresses, and vice versa.
My main point is that they won't switch to another blockchain and leave Bitcoin behind. Instead, they'll simply keep adding new blockchains depending on what every client requires/desires.
In other words, the entire system can theoretically work with any/all chains individually, interchangeably, and/or simultaneously. It will be up to each new client/service to decide which ones they use **in addition to** Bitcoin, not in lieu of Bitcoin.

This is the first time I've disagreed with you in a VERY long time.
The cyber security requirements/standards are the *only* portion of the entire BitLicense that I believe are necessary.
That said, I really wish that we, as an industry, had come up with decent security standards on our own. There have certainly been attempts to do so, but nothing has proven popular or prevalent. Some of the largest Bitcoin-related companies are still an absolute mess, and there are almost none that currently consider and continuously examine every threat vector.
Please name ONE Bitcoin company, including your own, that has an effective insider threat, technical/physical security, supply chain security, and disaster recovery plan in place. Just one.
Everyone in the industry appears to be f'n winging it with extremely junior security personnel and half-assed security auditing techniques.
Hell, I'd be surprised (shocked, actually) to find documented and regularly audited security plans at more than a handful of the businesses we use every day, and I know damn well that none of them are doing frequent personnel, technical, physical, and cyber audits.
How do I know? Because I've been attempting to sell said services to the major companies in this industry for the last year, and not a single one of them has said that they're ready for this type of security scrutiny at this stage. They either say they can't afford it, or they just don't consider certain threat vectors to be of any real concern. 
Sweeping for RF or powerline implants? Supply chain equipment compromise? Insiders? Expensive and extensive due diligence on ALL employees? Nahhh, that can all just wait, right? 
Bottom line: security is a f'n joke at this stage of the game in this industry. Most secondary and tertiary vectors of attack or compromise aren't even being considered, let alone covered.
I would support a license that says the following in one simple paragraph:  
*"You must maintain a complete documented security plan (covering every vector mentioned above, as well as a few others), you must do quarterly audits and tests in accordance with said plan, and you must mitigate all threats and vulnerabilities identified in the audits and tests prior to the next quarterly audits and tests. Spare no expense. Period."*

Are you suggesting that the Heartbleed Bug was intentionally inserted into the OpenSSL code at some point in the distant past? Or simply that serious vulnerabilities exist that may go undiscovered or unreported for a very long time?
If it's the latter, you should probably know that similarly catastrophic and undisclosed vulnerabilities exist in Bitcoin Core, as well. In fact, the core devs have frequently worked in secret to address such vulnerabilities, and we (the rest of the community) only find out about them after the fixes are put in place (BIP66 being one recent example of a very serious bug that we got VERY lucky nobody abused before the BIP was patched in).
The good news is that there are A LOT of eyes on the Bitcoin code, so I have high confidence that all known and reported vulnerabilities are being quietly/secretly addressed by our core devs.

That said, you're correct that we most certainly need to continue the research and development of quantum-safe encryption methods; and then we must implement solutions in all of the world's most critical/vulnerable systems.
There's a very good reason that such research is popular across the entire globe right now, and I know the Bitcoin core devs are paying very close attention -- some are even participating in the research themselves.

Another option might be a system similar to Shapeshift that allows you to go from:  
Any crypto -&gt; asset -&gt; any other crypto.
The last possibility could be that they're working with EtherParty -- which itself is supposed to be "blockchain agnostic."

His system sometimes mistakenly used freshly mined coins (possibly from Luke-jr's Eligious miners?) to fund withdrawals. (All freshly mined coins need 100 blocks before they can be spent, but some miners amateurishly pointed their miners directly to Gox's hot wallet). 
This technical problem is what led to the huge backlog of stuck TX in January 2014. Mark's system did not separate the fresh coins from the older coins -- which would have been a REALLY simple test to implement --  so, the Gox withdrawal system continuously tried to spend coins that were too young.

Correct. The legacy banking license allows them to operate as an actual bank in all 50 states, so it actually makes much more business sense for exchanges that plan to send and receive customer funds between banks, hold USD account balances, etc. It's also much more expensive to obtain and makes them exempt from separate BitLicense requirements.

Actually, many of the small block advocates have stated that they *do not* think Bitcoin itself should be used as electronic cash, or as Satoshi intended.  
Instead, they believe it should change to become a **settlement network** reserved for large businesses doing large (and expensive) transactions -- which is why they're advocating for eternally small blocks that will ultimately force small transactions (normal users) onto sidechains, alt coins, payment channels, Lightning Network, etc.
Their vision for what Bitcoin should become is fundamentally different than Satoshi's original intent.

Trustlessness and decentralization are what make Bitcoin profound. 
Without those attributes, blockchains become nothing more than very inefficient, federated databases.

The problem with that theory is that Willy simply bought 10-19 coins immediately in front of the spread, not at some much more inflated price.  At best, Willy moved the price a cent or two which each buy (every 5-10 minutes), which were almost always in between other very large accounts trading hundreds and thousands of coins in both directions. 
In other words, every purchase made by anyone on an exchange (ever) is technically "higher-than-market price," and yet Willy himself never really moved the price at all given the very low number of coins he purchased in any one trade. He may or may not have made up for that in volume, and in that way made an impact, but he never purchased at any price that was much higher than the market price at the moment of his trade. Make sense?
Note: I'm the fool who first discovered and reported Willy to the community. I'd very much like Daniel Tosh to play me in the movie. Please and thank you. lol :)
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:22:33
I've told you several times now while you are technically and factually incorrect, and you've yet to list a single example of a centrally controlled blockchain that has been successful.
Ripple has ridden the coat trails of Bitcoin for quite some time now, but it's far from I would define as successful. Mere existence does not equate to success.
Once again -- and this is not meant as an insult -- you simply don't yet understand blockchains and how/why they're much worse than federated databases when trustlessness and decentralization are not system requirements. I've explained this to you many times, and yet you're sitting there ignoring it like it was never even written.
Finally, my last point: developed and released by one person as open source is NOT the same thing as centrally controlled development. Therefore, describing any of the alternative cryptocurrencies as "centralized" misses the entire point and demonstrates a lack of understanding, again, of what is meant by trustlessness and decentralization.
As I said to you before, best of luck to you on your journey....

Actually, t0 appears to have developed two distinct solutions (that work together). 
The first is simply a system (or engine) that uses the actual Bitcoin blockchain to facilitate trading and settlement, thus potentially replacing the current systems used by the likes of NASDAQ and NYSE.
The second solution -- which appears to be the one they've partnered with PeerNova to develop -- is for stock loaning, specifically; thus potentially replacing the traditional stock loan facilitators (ie. banks, brokerages).
It looks like he's attempting to merge both "types" of blockchains -- both public and "permissioned" -- into one cohesive system.
Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they somehow (eventually) peg the second solution (the permissioned chain) to the Bitcoin blockchain itself using sidechains, or something similar. (Or using something even simpler, like OP_RETURN).
tl;dr - they've created two solutions -- one that uses public ledgers (ie. Bitcoin), **and** one that attempts to use private (or "permissioned") ledgers. The first is for straight trading and settlement, while the second is for stock loaning (ie. lending and borrowing stocks to short sell them).

That's simply not true when discussing/considering the scarcity of the whole units. IOW, regardless of our ability to add decimal places, there is still fixed scarcity of the whole units (Bitcoins) set at ~21 million. Dividing them, fractionally, does nothing to alter that cap.

That is exactly the incentive to run full nodes; and, I believe that's the exact reason we'll actually see many more full nodes once adoption explodes (after block size is increased).

Peter Todd created replace-by-fee (RBF) and then recently dropped in on to offer them his expertise in "stress testing" the network. He offered to do so more effectively than in previous stress tests if they could raise at least $5k to fund the attack.
RBF has been his baby for quite some time, and there was even a new BIP created for it a week or two ago.
I'm just connecting dots. We don't know who is behind the recent attacks yet, but my I'm guessing that they are huge fans of the Peter and LukeJr agendas...

Your location obviously has nothing to do with it, but your **personal desire** to never spend more than $100 to run a full node should not hold the entire network back. It's an unreasonable expectation and limitation.


The "barrier to entry" for billions of potential users is actually the inability of the current system to handle their transactions, which is due in large part to the arbitrary 1MB block size and people like you who are unwilling to ever spend more than $100 to run a full node.

You're absolutely correct, I am! The **entire point** of this thread is the discussion of terminology (aka semantics).  I'm trying to explain to you that, in the context of attacks, the concept of "distributed" is never limited to IP addresses. In bitcoin, it can be used to describe attacks originating simultaneously from multiple Bitcoin addresses.
IOW, hitting the Bitcoin network with 10000 simultaneous TX from 1000 different addresses is the conceptual equivalent of hitting your porn server with 1000 zombies in a botnet.

That much is obvious.

Actually, to repeat:  In this case, you can equate the high number of originating wallet addresses to the high number of originating IP addresses in a traditional (read: botnet) DDOS.
Within the context/boundaries of Bitcoin as a system, the origins of the attack (thousands of addresses) can rightfully be described as distributed.
Too many people wrongfully assume that "distributed" can only refer to IP addresses; when, in fact, it's simply an adjective describing any attack involving a high number of separate entities attacking a single target -- which, in this case, is a high number of wallet addresses attacking the singular Bitcoin network.

I do find it very interesting that they're filling to become a licensed Trust company, rather than applying for a BitLicense.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:21:55
Because Bitcoin is not more efficient than federated databases to begin with. In fact, it's grossly inefficient in comparison to other modern database solutions.
The ONLY profundity is in the trustless and decentralized nature of the system. If you remove those features -- which is what banks would have to do to create and control their own -- then there's nothing left that's appealing about the system.
With Bitcoin, we have traded database efficiency for trustlessness and decentralization.

Unfortunately, the release candidate was already out for 0.14.1 when the covert boosting vulnerability was identified. 
Last I heard, they're hoping to have it ready for 0.14.2.  Since extensive testing is always important, it may even slip farther than that.
There's really no rush, though, since the BU idiots probably won't merge it anyway.

That's why I'm hoping that the tumbling functionality is eventually built directly into the protocol and/or wallets -- either directly, or using a verifiable open source sidechain of some sort.


The U.S. Supreme Court itself decided that the use of money is a form of expression that is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
I am adamantly opposed to blanket surveillance of all financial transactions. They should be my business, and mine alone, until a legal warrant grants the state the right to obtain them. Period.
If tumbling prevents them from being able to spy on my every action, at will, then I have absolutely no fucks to give.

It's a real legal distinction. Robbery involves the use or threat of violence. Theft does not.
Example: If someone takes your car while you're not around, it's car theft. If they do the same thing while pointing a gun at your head, or otherwise threatening you with violence, it's robbery.
For that reason, taxes should be considered robbery, because nation states use the threat of violence to force you to pay them.

At no point during any of their ramblings about forks did they even come close to describing the unique nature of a fork in Bitcoin, specifically. There are many factors at play with Bitcoin that are not relevant to any other software fork, and they didn't mention a single one.

Being located in the U.S., providing quick access to all U.S. banks, and being immediately available in every state will provide them with a decent advantage over most foreign and other U.S. exchanges.

So, what's the problem again? This setup is no more difficult than the PayPal/eBay setup. It took me minutes to get setup on both Circle and Coinbase, and using both anytime I wish is just as easy as PayPal.
The benefits are decentralization, reduced fees, resistance to censorship, and the ability to transact in what will eventually be a deflationary currency.
Works for me!

That math doesn't seem correct to me. That would imply zero (0) SC once Bitcoin itself reaches ~21 million. Wouldn't the theoretical max for Bitcoin+SC be ~42 million (or ~21M x 2) instead?
Also, how can/will ownership or control of the peg be passed to a new owner if SC trades independently?

This actually isn't really PayPal's fault. It's simply a side effect of the Greek banks closing and freezing online banking services.
Since PayPal relies on bank accounts being linked to PayPal user accounts, it makes sense that their service won't work if the users' bank accounts are currently frozen.
**It's the exact same reason that most Greeks can't really use Coinbase at the moment either.**
@_date: 2015-07-30 09:09:13
The actual change is in Greg's and Adam's desire to change Bitcoin into a *settlement network* reserved for large companies and expensive transactions, rather than the global electronic cash Satoshi intended it to be.
They've said as much, and keeping the block size small is one of the tools they're using to make that change happen.

I'm not the one who said "woosh."  




None of the above provide the **type** of security that makes the Bitcoin blockchain unique and profound -- that being trustlessness that results in an immutable database -- and, if centralized, all of which would be much more efficient and traditionally secure using a modern, federated database structure in place of a blockchain.


LOL! That's f'n hilarious! Please look up the definitions for the words "escrow" and "arbitration."
It's quite obvious that you're neither a businessman or a computer scientist.
Trustlessness is actually one of the holy grails of all big business. **Trust (or the lack thereof) between parties is the single biggest challenge in business. Period.**  


See above. Your naivety is impressive.  


Such a centralized system could and would be much more capable, efficient, and traditionally secure if it used a standard federated database solution instead.  There is absolutely nothing gained by using a blockchain when trustlessness and decentralized control are not requirements.  


Of course it could "exist."  You or I could build a closed blockchain at home if we wanted.
The entire point is that, as a data structure, there is absolutely no benefit to using a blockchain instead of a standard federated database when trustlessness and decentralization are not required. From an engineering and efficiency perspective, it would be absolutely foolish to do so.
Once again, I think it's quite obvious that you're not a computer scientist or engineer; and, more importantly, it's also quite obvious that you have no idea how Bitcoin actually works, or what actually makes it profound.  
Best of luck to you on your journey to understanding!
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:10:21
But, when you take it to the extremes to illustrate your point, you miss out on the fact that we could actually have infinitely large blocks while maintaining the same small fee we enjoyed for the last several years.  
There's no need to even mention "infinitely small" fees; because, as you readily admitted, that's never been an actual proposal. Doing so comes across as hyperbole.
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:41:10


I said nothing of the sort. You're completely, continuously, and conveniently ignoring the benefits of a decentralized versus centralized solution. 


You mean the vocal minority who obviously post the problems they've had more often than the majority who don't bother with posting their successes?
Is this your first day on the Internet, or are you just slow?  


Bullshit. The 1% fee on Coinbase is lower than every credit card processing service on the planet. And, once you already own bitcoins, the future processing fees are practically zero, in terms of percentage, for every future transaction. 
You can keep saying that the fees are the same, but that's simply not true. You're being very dishonest.


The centralized DNMs are quite obviously NOT censorship resistant chicken the number of busts in recent years. Once again, you're being very dishonest.  


Possibly. The beauty of it is that once you have coins, you don't need to stick with using Coinbase, Circle, or any other centralized service as a wallet.
Once again, I now that you know that fact very well, but you're completely ignoring it for sake of argument. Dishonesty abounds.

I was never one who supported shutting down discussion of alternative consensus layer solutions. In fact, I personally despise Theymos for doing so (in most cases).
That said, SegWit is backwards compatible with the current consensus layer -- even moreso after last week's 0.14.1 update.

@_date: 2015-07-01 00:23:42


With Bitcoin, there are many DoS-type attacks by miners -- both theoretical and real -- that we've been discussing for years. (Search for "selfish miner attack", etc). Every new BIP requires extensive testing to eliminate (or simply reduce as much as possible) any potential attacks by dishonest nodes, users, and miners.
You might be surprised what can/will happen when money is involved; so, gaming all of the attack vectors is absolutely critical to the security and success of these p2p/distributed systems.
I haven't studied your system yet, so I don't have any specific suggestions or ideas (yet), but I do know that defending against (or coding to prevent) every manner of attack will likely be a full-time effort for most of your team throughout the lifetime of the project.
When money is involved in p2p, you **must** assume that participating nodes are neither rational or honest -- and then code/design accordingly.

The value is set by the owner of the coins, and every coin represents one (1) hour of labor. 
Unless you invent time travel, there could/would never be more than 168 LC per week per person/agent.
Every transaction would be a negotiated smart contract of labor for LC.
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:33:18
I'm basing my estimates on current (normal) user behavior with regards to the number of standard versus multisig transactions.
In order for the effective increase to grow beyond 1.75mb, user behavior would have to change -- more people would have to use higher order multisig transactions instead of standard transactions.
I've seen nothing to indicate such a change in behavior would happen any time soon, nor can I imagine *why* the number of multisig transactions would ever increase by more than a very negligible number in any short period of time (months).
That said, I don't really need to reconcile anything with what Gavin wrote -- the authors of SegWit themselves have estimated that the effective increase will likely max out between 1.6 and 1.75mb at some point in the year after SW is released.
Please study the actual SW technology, and do some research on the SW developers' statements, before challenging my statements again -- rather than basing your entire counter on what Gavin wrote...
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:30:47

Unfortunately, since 0.14.1 is already in RC and may be out next week, it looks like we'll have to wait until 0.14.2 to see this in an actual release.

Upon hearing the news yesterday, my initial reaction was to buy a few hundred new coins on Monday morning. 
Sadly, after considering the reality of the situation, and realizing that the "consensus" reached yesterday is no better than the same alleged agreements reached between Jtoomin (of Bitcoin Classic) and a few miners last month, I decided to wait and watch for a while longer.
I'm optimistic that the media may play a role in a bump this week when this story hits the airwaves tomorrow, I personally feel said bump will likely be temporary. In fact, I'm concerned that this issue won't really be settled until well AFTER the halving this summer. And then? The entire "agreement" will probably fail for all the reasons the same hard fork proposal has failed for the last couple of years...

In all fairness, Greg, that's exactly how open source projects *are supposed to work*.
The appropriate OS credits are given in the Classic code, splash pages, github, etc. -- all in accordance with generally accepted OS licensing -- so I'm really not sure why you're accusing them of malfeasance.
What's the deal, man? Did you or others genuinely not realize that this has always been a perfectly acceptable and reasonable possibility with this open source project?
As someone who has contributed to and followed countless OS projects over the years, I see nothing unethical, unexpected, or otherwise unreasonable in this Classic fork.

Two words: fee market.  
Two more words: artificial scarcity. (In reference to block space)  
Yes, these two concepts are currently being encouraged by several of the core devs who wish to leave blocksize alone. The effect would be that most small transactions are pushed off the main chain and/or into third party services.
So, you tell me, is that what's happening now?

Since the entire mining industry, when balanced, operates near zero margin, users (and developers) must do everything **that's within our power** to ensure that the miners' playing field remains as level as possible. Any time the mining field of play becomes imbalanced, the likelihood of centralization increases dramatically.
That's not good mmkay.
A community-wide effort to install a fix for the **potential use** of covert boosting, by anyone, is most certainly within our power.
Anyone who objects to such a necessary fix can and should be considered hostile toward the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2016-02-06 22:46:14

The key is to keep said fees reasonable *for everyone*.

BU is not now, nor has it ever been, a "viable option" for Bitcoin. The emergent consensus model they're using is critically flawed and would likely spell the death of the protocol, rather than "saving" it.
The status quo is actually better than every EC implementation seen to date.
So be it.

Incorrect. That 4mb figure is only *theoretically* obtainable **IF** there is 100% adoption of SegWit **AND 100% of all transactions** are SW Multisig (at 3of3 or higher).
Given current transaction behavior, the **very most** we would see with 100% adoption of SegWit is 1.75 to 2MB.

Those statements were quite some time ago. Thanks to a dramatic increase in my invested capital back in early February of this year, along with some extremely astute margin trading since, my DCA is actually below $250 now.
That said, I'm also sitting in an all-in 3.3x margin short from around 298 at the moment, so that number will be even lower soon once I decide to take profit and possibly go long again.
Yay for me.
What do you think? Is the new  bottom in yet, or should I let it all ride down into the 260s or lower? Tonight is looking like a possible retest of 272, so I'll probably make a move or two before morning.

I guess that could actually be argued now since those using the covert boost will lose their 30% energy advantage, thus leveling the playing field and allowing more small competitors to stay in the game.
Kind of a stretch, though, and certainly not expected.

I'm a huge fan of payment channel solutions, and Lightning Network in particular.
That said, Lightning Network will likely take *years* to mature, and LN itself won't even scale with only 1 or 2mb blocks on the main chain.
It's simply much too soon to transition the main chain to settlements only (or a fee market, for that matter). And, more importantly, neither the higher level systems or users are ready for that.

That's true, but many wallets don't even have manually adjustable fees, let alone dynamic fees.

Tell that to the 95+% of users (nodes), 100% of major businesses, and 100% of major wallet providers, who all currently support the Core consensus layer and SegWit upgrade.
Oh wait, let me guess, they don't matter?
If the alternate consensus layers activate with ONLY miner support, then it can and should be considered a 51% attack on Bitcoin.

I don't think the BU devs are ever going to backport the boosting fix to work on their client that is built from Core's old 0.12.1. 
In order to force Jihan to use the fix, we'd have to do a community-wide UASF for the fix itself...which is yet another headache on top of all the other UASF drama we're dealing with already.

Users (and developers) must do everything **that's within our power** to ensure that the miners' playing field remains as level as possible. Any time the mining field of play becomes imbalanced, the likelihood of centralization increases dramatically.
That's not good mmkay.
A community-wide effort to install a fix for the **potential use** of covert boosting, by anyone, is most certainly within our power.
Anyone who objects to such a necessary fix can and should be considered hostile toward the Bitcoin network.

Did it come with the required power supplies?
After the next difficulty adjustment (in roughly 4 days), using your 1.7 TH/s miner, and given the current price of $1195 per bitcoin, **you'll make approximately $31 worth of bitcoin per month (or 0.02584340 btc).**
That estimated income will likely decrease in small increments every two weeks if the mining difficulty (based on total Bitcoin hashing power) continues to increase as it has been doing for a very long time.
Your $350 miner may pay for itself in roughly 12-18 months.

You're mistakenly assuming the markets notice or care about intangible and immeasurable factors like "decentralization."
Pro tip:  They don't. Not even a little bit. Most traders (and users!) wouldn't notice a goddamn thing if the number of mining pools or nodes was cut in half through such tactics as 30% energy savings.
Jihan knows this, as well.

AFAIK, opening/funding a payment channel absolutely requires a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain itself -- as does closing/settlement of any channel.
How would it possibly work otherwise? How can you initially lock bitcoins into a LN channel without actually doing a bitcoin transaction to fund said channel?
Regarding  LN transfers what are essentially IOU's for bitcoin back and forth, not actual bitcoins. It's not until final settlement *on the blockchain* that actual bitcoins are transferred to any/all participants in a channel.
Actual bitcoins, or the entries in the ledger that depict ownership, *never* leave the blockchain itself.

Actually, the point that I've made previously, which he was referring to, is that larger and wider adoption will also lead to more companies relying and building on Bitcoin, which in turn will lead said companies to run more full nodes of their own for tx security and audit purposes.

No, it doesn't. 
At best, with 100% adoption, we may see an *effective* increase to 1.75mb blocks -- which might take a year to reach, though.
In the meantime, based on accelerated adoption of the new client -- accelerated in relation to historical client adoption -- we'll likely still only see an effective increase to between 1.3 and 1.5mb blocks this calendar year.
Either way, that's not 2mb. You either didn't know or don't care about this truth...

The system will work both with and without third parties operating *some* of the nodes, and none of them will ever control your actual Bitcoin private keys while your coins are locked in the LN system(s). The system will also include incentives that prevent major centralized nodes from forming and facilitating too many of the infrastructure's transactions.

The same is true for any off-chain/internalized solution that involves simply changing values in a controlled database -- for example, two Coinbase account holders exchanging funds for free.
You're not really comparing apples to apples.  
A Bitcoin transaction between two *unrelated* parties, perhaps even internationally separated, is still MUCH cheaper and faster than most (if not all) other non-crypto methods of transferring funds.

Where would they source the hardware to do so without anyone figuring it out?
The only possible answer, of course, is that they would need to co-opt existing miners and/or mining hardware manufacturers.
And then, once discovered, their entire plan would become pointless the minute the rest of us implement a defensive POW change. 
Other than a brief disruption that ultimately gets them nowhere, they can't really do jackshit to shut down Bitcoin altogether.
The key is in discovering their attack. For that, we need good old fashioned intelligence on the true motives for all Chinese miners' actions.

@_date: 2017-04-06 00:24:58
That would actually be completely fair. The issue is that the ASICBOOST creator patented it without a free public license, so miners aren't allowed to *legally* run it in most countries. It's also easily detectable, so we'd know right away if anyone used it.
I wouldn't be surprised to see the Chinese miners turn on the overt version after this, considering the fact that their government gives exactly zero fucks about blatant patent infringement, and the miners themselves obviously don't really care about pissing everyone off.

That is incorrect. See my other reply to you above.
Segwit does, in fact, inadvertently neuter Bitmain's hardware-based boost -- which explains nearly all of Wu's exceedingly strange statements and actions for the last year.

The vast majority of finance and economics majors/professionals I've met in the last couple of years understand **absolutely nothing** about Bitcoin's economic incentive and market structures, let alone it's technical attributes.
I consult to them on this subject on a daily basis, at the executive level, and very few of them are able to grasp even the most basic concepts involved in this new system. Every last one of them tries, and ultimately fails miserably, to squeeze Bitcoin and other blockchains into their current frameworks of understanding.
It's sometimes very overwhelming and depressing to think about any of them affecting -- or, worse yet, controlling -- *any* aspect of this technology's future.

No. Segwit itself *also* prevents the hardware boost from working, which is likely the sole reason Wu has been against Segwit *this entire time*.
In other words, Segwit itself (as well as a few other improvements) would destroy Wu's covert 30% advantage just as effectively as Greg's new BIP.
Greg's new BIP is simply meant to speed up the process of stopping the exploit. It's also much more effective since we don't know whether or not Segwit will ever activate (even after this has been brought to light).

If the patch is made available for all versions simultaneously, the UASF for fixing **covert** ASICboost may actually work, and Jihan would be left with no choice.
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:07:26
Which is which?
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:04:07
SegWit in 0.14.1 still stops covert Asicboost for the miners who actually run SegWit clients -- which they are likely to do *unless* the profits from Asicboost still outweigh all the fees they would get from mining SW transactions.

@_date: 2017-04-24 15:22:21
You are correct.  However, any implementation that diverges from the currently agreed upon set of basic rules for tx and block validity can legitimately be viewed as a hostile threat by those who agree with the current set of rules, and be treated as such.
There's also the issue of "economic majority" versus "miner majority," but that's where definitions get really fuzzy and hypothetical.  If 51+% of miners mine a coin that NO major exchange is willing to list as "Bitcoin," could/would it still *be* Bitcoin, or should it be considered something new?
Also, I noticed you didn't distinguish between mining and non-mining nodes.  Core currently runs on 94+% of all full nodes, so what does that make BU even if it were to gain 51+% of the hashrate?
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:09:47
Not "done."
Payment channel apps themselves, if they become ultra-popular and lead to exponential adoption, will result in a VERY HIGH demand for a more effective and long-term on-chain scaling solution, as well.
The irony is that those demanding a larger base size *now* don't understand that fact.

An "optimization" and inherent advantage that is the sole basis for their objection to most protocol improvements.
In other words, their greed is preventing the entire network from upgrading the protocol, and they've been completely dishonest about their objections to Segwit *the entire time!*

No, they don't. 
While I'm a huge fan of SegWit for several other reasons, it does NOT, and will not, result in an effective increase to 2MB.
In fact, with SegWit alone, I personally doubt we'll even see an effective increase to 1.75MB this year. 
Given current user behavior, with just SegWit I'm guessing maybe 1.5MB by next Christmas, at best.

The part where you dismissed this as just another effort by Greg to activate Segwit.
This goes well beyond just activating Segwit.
It turns out that Segwit's greatest adversary, Jihan Wu, is only fighting against all things Core because Segwit nullifies his super-secret 30% energy advantage -- which effectively means that every other reason he's given to oppose Segwit, and every other action he's taken to diminish Core's status, have been completely dishonest.

In other words, not a single one of them understands what actually makes Bitcoin itself profound. I tried on some occasions to convince them otherwise, but they didn't even want to hear it -- most of them are absolutely convinced that they can somehow harness all of the power of a Bitcoin-like blockchain within a closed system.

It's not a back and forth dance at all. I very much believe that SegWit2x will retain the name based on accumulated difficulty/hashpower, which is why I consistently list it as Bitcoin when I discuss the multiple chains.
That said, if another chain somehow surpasses SegWit2x in accumulated sha256 difficulty/hashpower, I will call that other chain "Bitcoin."

Have you seen the adoption curve for SegWit transactions? It will take a year or more for SegWit2x blocks to even approach 4MB, let alone anything larger.
In reality, it's simply an instant 1MB increase -- that has immediate positive results -- followed by a very long and slow build-up toward 3 or ~4 MB total.
If that's not moderate, I don't know what is.

I have not posted my personal opinion on the EO itself throughout the entire discussion. Not even once. All I've done during the last two days is try to educate you (*especially* you) on how the EO and OFAC sanctions actually work -- nothing more, nothing less.
The "political reasons" I mentioned above are simply the fact that they're unlikely to add Snowden's name to the list because doing so would likely blow up in their faces, politically. (He has way too much support for them to add him without creating a massive uproar).
So, if you would just kindly shove your mistaken assumptions straight back up your ass, that would be swell. Mmkay?

Yes, the 12-month holding period is still a requirement for BIT itself. So, anyone who directly gives Grayscale bitcoins in exchange for new BIT shares must still wait the mandatory 12 months before being allowed to withdraw those shares, convert them to GBTC shares, and sell them on the open markets.
Also, as far as I know, only **accredited investors** can purchase BIT shares through Grayscale with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-09 02:28:03
I don't think you understand what "pre mine" means.
That said, the answer to your last question is simple: They would build it on top of Bitcoin because Bitcoin is the largest and most secure trustless ledger in the world.

Let me clarify something: While GBTC itself does not function that way, BIT, the actual traded fund, **does**, in fact, work exactly that way (to an extent).
BIT provides exactly that mechanism to "authorized participants" who wish to purchase shares of BIT directly from SecondMarket (or now Grayscale?) by depositing bitcoins in exchange for BIT shares.
The catch, and the reason I wrote "to an extent" above, is that according to the last amended pubic filing for BIT/GBTC, SecondMarket was the only named "authorized participant" at that time.
Therefore, while it's quite possible that they (Greyscale now?) can indeed issue more/new BIT shares to those authorized participants who invest their bitcoins directly into BIT, it's unknown whether or not they've added any additional authorized participants since the time of that amended filing; and, of course, any/all new shares issued through that mechanism would still need to be held for at least 12 months before they could be transferred/converted to sell as GBTC on the OTC Markets.
I just wanted to confuse everyone even more with this little bit of added "clarity".... lol ;)

It's not what I "think." It's not a matter of opinion.
It's an undeniable fact that Snowden is NOT on the SDN list, and he is not the target of the new Executive Order. 
Any prior monitoring and/or freezing of Snowden's finances was done at the behest of Congress, not this EO or the OFAC.
Adding his name to the SDN list would be fairly redundant and pointless at this time.

It's the value of bitcoin (the currency) that has dropped, not the interest in funding the infrastructure and services built around it. 
At the same time that bitcoin's price was decreasing throughout all of 2014, investor interest was actually still increasing throughout the entire year.
The closing of one ridiculously named and hardly used exchange doesn't provide any sort of indicator; and, them blaming "silicon valley investors" for their own failures wouldn't surprise me at all.

It's actually not vague at all. The EO was explicitly written to create a new OFAC category, and the OFAC SDN sanctions work in a very specific (and very public) way.
The language of the EO certainly leaves the door open to add people like Snowden to the official SDN list in the future, but the fact remains that he is **not** on the SDN list **right now.**

The point is that they can't take  YOUR stuff unless you donate to him AFTER his name gets added to the official SDN list.
And, as of right now, his name is NOT on the list.
They can still go after him all they want using laws and regulations in place long before this EO. However, they can't go after YOUR fucking stuff unless you donate to someone on the official SDN list.
Seriously, I'm genuinely trying to help you understand the EO and how official OFAC sanctions work. Which part of this confuses you?
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:11:32

@_date: 2015-04-04 21:25:46
The SecTreas and Treasury itself are further regulated by a literal crap-ton of Congressional Acts and Federal Regulations that govern how they impose sanctions and prosecute those who violate them.
Sadly, this particular EO is not much different than the one George W. Bush signed in 2001 to create the *Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT)* category for OFAC. In fact, even much of the language is the same (EO 13224).
However, the impact of that particular EO (13224) was later made much worse by the Patriot Act and resulting changes to the IEEPA that made it possible for the Treasury to freeze/seize the assets of suspected *terrorists* even without first concluding a formal investigation.
The same thing could happen with cyber-related designees in the future, but it would likely take an act of Congress to modify the Patriot Act and IEEPA first. Without such modifications, they'd have to link the cyber activity to terrorism (which, in fairness, might be easy) before they could leverage the Patriot Act and EO 13224 to go after them instead.
It's all a mess, for sure, but the bottom line is that Snowden isn't on this list or targeted by this specific EO... yet. He may be in the future, but he's not now.
Please note that there are much older "aiding and abetting a known fugitive" laws that could apply to Snowden, though, so tread carefully and be ready to deal with the consequences if the Feds decide to make an example out of anyone...

"Completely describes"... "The very type of"... 
Face it, buddy, you're wrong. The EO currently has nothing at all to do with Snowden. The monitoring and freezing of his finances was done long before this EO was even dreamt of, and his name is NOT in the official list of SDN's.
Could his name be added later? Sure, I guess.. but, doing so at this stage would actually be both redundant and ridiculous -- not to mention the political fire it would likely reignite.
I'm betting that we'll only see identified hackers involved in major hacking incidents populate this particular list.
After all, as you saw with PayPal and the CC companies, they didn't even need this EO to affect the finances for the likes of Assange and Snowden. Something like this may have made it easier, or faster, but it wouldn't have changed much in terms of results.
I'm not "shilling" for anything or anyone, but I clearly have a much more thorough understanding of this particular policy (and many others) than you do.

I would argue that only one bullet in the entire EO seems applicable to the names you listed -- so not quite "to the T."  
The rest of the EO is specifically directed toward state-sponsored or criminal hackers that steal U.S. intellectual property, attack critical infrastructure, or otherwise severely compromise U.S. information systems.
Also, I'll repeat this one final time: **they can't use the powers granted by this EO to come after YOUR stuff unless you continue to materially support persons or entities AFTER they've been added to the official SDN list. Period.**

The entire EO was written to empower the Department of Treasury to create the new category under OFAC.
The legalese may be confusing, but that's the intent of the EO -- which is why the Secretary of the Treasury is named several times throughout the document as the primary executor and the one who determines which names/entities are added.
The Secretary of Treasury's tool for doing so is OFAC.

If that's truly the case, and there's simply no chance that Bitcoin itself can ever scale, then the core developers should release **a new and more accurately titled white paper** that properly describes Bitcoin as **something other than P2P cash**.
Put on your big boy pants, admit defeat, and do the right thing so that people everywhere can stop pitching Bitcoin as being what Satoshi intended.
Meanwhile, users and devs who still wish to follow Satoshi's original vision for this experiment can switch over to something like XT and keep trying...
@_date: 2015-09-02 16:16:08
I feel that **"trustless p2p cash transactions"** should be added to the very top of your list of Bitcoin's core value propositions, and I find it interesting that you've omitted it.

As I understand it, the index supposedly uses the weighted average of something like 100 Bitcoin trading services to determine the index price of Bitcoin.
For some reason, that weighting system apparently failed after "429,000 BTC were sold on yunbi down to the price of 1201 CNY."  However, it's probably safe to say that such a sale really didn't happen; and, even if it had, the index shouldn't have been so drastically affected since it's supposedly weighted.
The result of all of the above caused 796.com's weekly settlement to occur drastically lower than it should have since they use that index to determine the settlement price.
In order to fix this, they're going to have to determine what the index should have really been, and then roll back the settlement accordingly before reopening trading.
It's a pretty nasty mess, actually... and that index service definitely has some explaining to do.

The answer to your question is already known.  
As long as Snowden's name is not added to the Treasury's official SDN list, **the EO itself** cannot be leveraged to go after people who donate to Snowden.
That said, they're more than likely watching his finances, so they might come up with a different way to screw with his supporters -- but, if that happens, it *won't* be **the new EO itself** that empowers them to do so.

As I've pointed out in that will only work until Ripple Labs creates additional proprietary functionality/features for RippleTrader and all gateways update to support the new software. At that time, RL may require "compatible clients" to be certified to work with the new gateways, and you better damn believe they'll require those apps to include the KYC/AML functionality to keep playing. Since they now market Ripple as a "fully compliant" and controllable system, they can't afford to have the majority of the users work outside their compliance mechanisms -- as doing so would make all of their compliance claims to legislators null and void.

The investment numbers referred to in the Coindesk article are simple, real, and therefore undeniable. As a result, their "on pace for" statement is/was wholly reasonable and justified.
And where did you get the idea that the Buttercoin staff includes "seasoned investors"? What is that based on? There are a myriad of reasons that could have led to their failure to raise money. (Shitty marketing, uninspiring business plan, poor staffing, more attractive alternatives, etc).
One failed business does not demonstrate a pattern or a shift in overall investor sentiment -- especially when that one business is yet another exchange with a tiny customer base. After all, it's just one data point, right?

It *could* extend to people like Snowden *in the future*. However, as of right now, no new names have been added to the SDN list as a result of the new EO, and there are no *official sanctions* against Snowden himself.

*"On pace for..."* is a wholly justified and reasonable analysis based on the pace of investments in Q1 2015.
As with any predictive analysis, it could ultimately be wrong -- and even by an order of magnitude -- but, that doesn't make it any less justified or reasonable at this time.
I've also had my own direct experiences with investors in this space this year, but I don't really want to get into those since they're anecdotal -- just as the Buttercoin experiences themselves are anecdotal.

Such a system could/would simply resemble Bitcoin itself after a successful 51% attack wherein one mining entity takes over everything.
I'm not sure the inefficiencies are worth it with such a system, though. The *primary* reason those inefficiencies are worth it in the current Bitcoin system is because they're mandatory to maintain **trustlessness.**
Dr. Brown at IBM seems to think that it's easier to create smart contracts using the blockchain data structure, though -- even if it's centralized and requires trust.
I'd have to see the proofs of concept and efficiency tests for that hypothesis before passing full judgment...

That's an awful lot of words to say that you believe the State should/will eternally reject permissionless systems; and that, instead, time and effort should continue to be wasted on inefficient permission-based alternatives that merely paint the current financial turd a nice shade of gold.
*"existing financial standard practices [that are] flawed and imperfect"* should be nominated for Understatement of the Year.
"Anonymous validation" is also a very cute dismissal of Bitcoin's actual trustlessness and the tremendous benefits gained by said trustlessness.
The fact that many of us trust Bitcoin's trustless network much more than we trust any government or central bank, and that our numbers are growing every day, should tell you everything you need to know about the upcoming *fight* you're going to witness over the next few decades.

My entire point is that he's not in there *now,* nor do I personally believe he'll be added in the future (based on the *actual* shitstorm that might ignite).

Any possible sanctions or monitoring of Snowden's finances has absolutely nothing to do with the new EO.  After all, he's wanted on espionage charges in the United States, so it's ~~highly likely~~ pretty much guaranteed that his finances have been tracked since day one. 
For that reason, placing his name on the official sanctions list would be both redundant and ridiculous.

LOL, ok man. Eventually you're going to realize that I'm not even arguing that point.
I'm not telling anyone not to be concerned with the EO itself. All I've been saying is that it has nothing to do with Snowden, his name isn't on the SDN list, and that the title for your other thread is complete bullshit that you pulled straight out of your ass.
You're fearmongering using a fabricated connection between Snowden and the EO. The fearmongering itself may be wholly justified, but the bullshit connection to Snowden -- claiming that it is NOW illegal to donate to him as a direct result of the EO -- is not justified. It's dishonest,  immature, and completely unnecessary.

Circle has the luxury of belonging to both an open and a closed system, simultaneously. So, saying that they're now "equal" to Venmo is just plain wrong.

Today, it's Coinwallet. Tomorrow? Maybe they'll attempt to censor all transactions originating from Country X, Company Y, Political Party Z, etc. If enough large miners decide to participate, it's no different than a 51% attack and centralized control of Bitcoin.
All valid transactions with proper fees should be mined. Period.
Encouraging otherwise is a vote for censorship.

I didn't say anything about "need." In this case, the word "desire" is probably more accurate -- as in, I *desire* my inalienable *human right* to privacy.
And, while Bitcoin's UTXO solution doesn't provide anonymity, it's certainly a huge step above addresses and balances tied to some sort of ID variable.

That assumes they'll use the Bitcoin blockchain itself, or another unnamed token-based cryptocurrency, rather than their own custom system that uses something other than financial incentives for participating nodes -- and yet, they are all presenting their concepts as something separate from, or in lieu of, a network (blockchain) involving financial incentive mechanisms.
Not a single one of them has provided specifics as to what the "other" incentive structures might be.

Wrong again.
You're misunderstanding the entire function and purpose of the executive order.
It was written for the sole purpose of creating a new cyber-related category for the Treasury's official OFAC sanctions -- which, in turn, are based on very public lists of individuals and companies (this is called the "SDN List").

How does he "show" them? Screenshots? Those are too easy to manipulate to really "prove" anything, but my guess is that they'd likely be good enough to settle the matter.  After all, if the vendor generates a unique address for every transaction, simply knowing that the receiving address belongs to the vendor is an indication that the buyer is the one who made the purchase.

There is an entire thread here on the front page with 1500+ upvotes that has a title claiming the EO itself made it "illegal" to donate to Snowden, specifically.
Which, of course, is complete bullshit.
Any possible sanctions or monitoring of Snowden's finances has absolutely nothing to do with the new EO.  After all, he's wanted on espionage charges in the United States, so it's ~~highly likely~~ pretty much guaranteed that his finances have been tracked since day one. 
For that reason, placing his name on the official sanctions list would be both redundant and ridiculous.

Correct. *Prior* notice of a listing is not required for them to freeze/seize someone's assets -- and then only add them to the list after the fact.  
However, in order for *you* to have *your* assets frozen or seized *simply for donating to someone*, your donation would have to occur **after** their name was added to the official SND list.
Otherwise, we (the public) have no way of knowing who or who isn't being sanctioned.
All official sanctions are made public primarily for this reason. The publicly posted sanctions are meant to pressure the sanctioned party AND inform the public who we're not allowed to do business with.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:30:20
The EO is real.
However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that it applies to Snowden, or that his name is on the list referred to in the EO itself.

Actually, no.
Bitcoin, by itself, does not provide for anonymity.

That still requires one of them in complete control of the code, updates, and ultimately, the blockchain itself.
There's no way (that I know of) to achieve actual trustlessness if you limit participation using miner white lists and other access controls.

They've certainly considered it. Hell, Bitfinex got its start by using a shared pool with Bitstamp, and the FX markets have been using liquidity pools for years.
The Bitcoin exchanges simply haven't found or created a viable pooling solution... yet.
The keys, of course, are trust and speed.
Could the Lightning Network be the solution for both? I don't know... yet.
But, inspired by my own comment earlier, I already reached out to a member of the LN team to take the first steps... ;)

He's talking about miners that abstain from voting in each round of votes. It's reasonable to consider the silence (lack of vote) as an acceptance of the status quo for those miners (IOW, an acceptance of whatever the current hardLimit is at that point in time).

The EO empowers the Secretary of Treasury, specifically, as the primary executor. He or she, in turn, relies on Treasury's OFAC to control, coordinate, and potentially enforce all official sanctions.

Pro tip: the same could be done right now with any collusion over 50%, regardless of BIP100, so I'm not really sure what makes you think that BIP100 makes that situation any better, worse, or more/less likely.

I don't think "bind faith" is the issue here. Many of us have taken the extra precautions necessary to mitigate this attack and others -- up to, and including, only storing minimal amounts of our holdings on these brand new devices...  *for exactly this reason.*

You can't rewrite history to change the fact that Satoshi shared the initial mining client with the world almost immediately after mining the genesis block.
That's the exact opposite of pre mining.

Not exactly true. The initial 178,800 shares were offered/purchased at a share price of just $12.64 on September 25, 2013. So, there should be a decent number of BIT holders who could sell at a significant profit right now.

I think you're correct. However, as soon as they say/admit that, you can quickly point out that the Bitcoin network itself would *completely cease to exist* without the bitcoin currency/token. The two are inseparable.
At that point, they may try to argue, or they'll just sit there with a dumb look on their face pretending you're wrong. 
If they try to claim that they'll use a different blockchain altogether, just keep asking them which one until they finally admit that an alternative doesn't exist yet.

I believe that several (most?) of the core developers no longer believe it's even possible for Bitcoin to live up to the *title* of Satoshi's paper.
In fact, for that reason, I've suggested to some of them that they should release a new Bitcoin white paper that *removes* "p2p cash" from both the title and scope of this entire experiment.
@_date: 2015-09-04 00:40:04
Nonsense. You know damn well that the dramatic drop in full nodes over the last two years was the direct result of two very specific factors:  
1. Mining at home stopped being profitable, and   
2. The advent of easy-to-use SPV and web wallets completely replaced the need to run qt (or core) at home (for new users and those who are much less technical than you or I).  
I have **never** heard or seen anyone say that blocksize is the reason they don't run a full node. Not even once.

First, I'm not demanding anything. Second, there are *numerous* incentives for Bitcoin services to run their own nodes.
In fact, the ONLY remaining market for Bitcoin Core consists of: Geeks, Governments, and businesses.
Sure, they could outsource the nodes (like many of us do already using housing services), but there's no reason to think that the hosting services wouldn't be just as diversified and globally distributed as they are today.
The "Bitcoin node services" will likely resemble web hosting services today, and there's certainly no shortage of those on any contingent in the world (except Antarctica, of course... lol).
Are you suggesting that exponentially more users wouldn't lead to exponentially more companies competing to provide services to those users?
Note: we have NOT had a mass adoption event in Bitcoin yet... not even close.

With Snowden, specifically, they could even rely on the very tried and true "aiding and abetting a fugitive" laws that everyone should be familiar with.
That said, this EO specifically empowers the Secretary of Treasury as the primary executor. In turn, the Secretary of Treasury relies on his OFAC to control, coordinate, and potentially enforce official sanctions.

Factually incorrect. I confronted Mark on IRC with the existence of Willy in late January 2014, and he adamantly denied it. He was therefore made aware of its existence long before the actual bankruptcy.
One of his contracted technical support agents in IRC, SarahBitcoin, also claimed that Willy was likely a VIP trader with co-hosted direct access to the servers -- but, I'm still not sure if MtGox ever offered such a service. 
IMO, even if they did offer such a service, it's not very likely that Willy was a paying VIP trader with such access.
It should also be noted that I ultimately selected and announced the bot's name, but I'm not the one who originally suggested it. ;)

If true, this is NOT good news.

They have no way of knowing the *actual* origin of these transactions, or any other, and blocking based on origin should never be encouraged or supported by anyone.

It's not outside the realm of possibility that both Mike and Gavin decided that a fire needed to be lit to encourage real discussion and real decisions, and that XT was the tool they used to set that fire -- all the while knowing that the fork itself would likely fail, yet still serve to ignite the discussion.
Also, if that's the case, their plan has actually been wildly successful.

You need to study up on how official sanctions work, and the role that the Department of Treasury plays in the sanctions regime.
The EO very clearly empowers the Secretary of Treasury as the primary executor; and he, in turn, delegates all sanction-related matters at Treasury to his OFAC.

Yes, I'll continue to use common sense and pay attention.

Actually, yes. Yes I do. 
It's you who doesn't understand how official sanctions work. They are run out of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the names are **purposely** released to the public in order to place the targeted entities on notice *and* inform U.S. persons/companies who they cannot conduct business with.

Here's the actual Specially Designated Nationals list (SDN):   
  
Here's the official Treasury page dedicated to these new cyber-related sanctions, specifically:  
   
Full list of official sanctions programs, including the new cyber program:  
  
It should also be noted that NO NEW ENTITIES WERE ADDED to the list following the signing of the new Executive Order 13964. In other words, they haven't used it to target anyone yet.
So yeah... you're wrong... and you're welcome.

There's a very large difference between this and an IPO.
In this case, there were no new shares issued as GBTC when it went live last week, so the lack of liquidity is/was to be expected.
Do you understand how BIT and GBTC work? Or how current BIT holders provide the only *potential* liquidity for GBTC trading?

So, you're basically just assuming that he's on the list based on the language of the EO?
I'd simply recommend seeking out the actual new list before making that assumption and writing threads like this one -- especially without a caveat saying something like "IF he is added to the list," or "he COULD POSSIBLY BE sanctioned with this new EO."

Any transaction not facilitated and recorded by the Bitcoin blockchain is not Bitcoin itself.
I don't consider off-chain systems  "Bitcoin itself" because they're using something other than the actual Bitcoin blockchain to handle access, record keeping, and transactions.
Coinbase, Changetip, Bitfinex, Lightning Network, etc -- all of which "lock" your coins up while you're using their off-chain transaction systems -- with each simply offering varying levels of control over your funds while they're locked.
It's a pretty black and white definition, but I think it's reasonable given the generally accepted distinction between transfer protocols and their complimentary layered services.

The point is that larger blocks will require more tx to fill, so spamming them for any length of time will be much more expensive than it is now.
If it costs X to fill the 1MB blocks with spam now, it will cost ~8X to fill 8MB blocks.

@_date: 2015-09-04 14:20:40

@_date: 2015-04-29 04:37:34


I made no such claim.
As far as I know, the only reason nobody has sold to the current bids is because it has supposedly taken weeks to transfer and process the BIT shares -- converting the BIT certificates to GBTC, transferring the certificates between SecondMarket and the brokerages, and then finally loading those shares into the brokerages' systems.
My points were that these trades could happen instantly once those logistics are completed by potential sellers; and, since the bidders don't know exactly if/when that will happen, they can't just pull their current high bids at the last second to prevent the trades from happening.

"Doable" doesn't answer anything.

@_date: 2015-09-04 19:44:45


That is just a hypothesis, not a fact.
Many people -- including myself -- believe that the exact opposite will occur after a genuine mass adoption event.
My hypothesis (given a core network capable of scaling. ie bigger blocks and compression techniques):  
*More users --&gt; more companies developing Bitcoin-related services for those new users --&gt; more companies running their own full nodes to secure and audit their users' tx.*
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:17:20


The actual incentives to run a full node are plentiful for:  geeks, governments, and businesses.
Security of your own tx, or that of your clients, being the primary incentive, of course.
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:05:42

Actually, I tend to agree with the previous poster. My logic for order of events:  
Bigger blocks (scalability) -&gt; mass adoption event(s) -&gt; more companies with Bitcoin-related services, because money -&gt; more of those companies run their own full nodes for security and auditing purposes -&gt; more full nodes.

The damage from a government-sponsored 51% attack on Bitcoin would be both expensive and temporary. The joke would be on them when the core devs publish an emergency patch that nullifies the government's efforts and possibly even rolls back the chain to before the attack. 
It would also be almost impossible for any nation, other than China, to build the capacity required for such an attack without anyone else noticing. (The PRC could simply assume control of existing Chinese miners).
The good news is that smarter people than you have discussed this scenario for years, and they've (we've) also already made all of this very clear to the USG leadership.

They can and should be encouraged to mine based on however they feel about size, fees, or any other factor that isn't tied to origin, destination, or identities.
However, we, as a community, should *never* encourage them to select the tx based on *any* specific origin, destination, or identities.
Doing so is targeted censorship, plain and simple.

The EO might apply to "someone like" Snowden in the future, or even Snowden himself if something changes *in the future*;  but, it does NOT apply to Snowden himself *right now.*
Why not? Because his name has not been added to OFAC's official SDN list. Period.
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:23:40
The EO very clearly spells out the Secretary of Treasury as the primary executor (or lead decision maker) for the EO itself. In this case, I used the general term "executor" to mean "one who executes the order."
The exact phrases in the EO that I'm capturing with that word are as follows:  
* "determined by the Secretary of the Treasury"  
* "**The Secretary of the Treasury**, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, **is hereby authorized** to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order." 
* "**The Secretary of the Treasury**, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, **is hereby authorized** to submit the recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c))."  
Now, in order to determine *how* the SecTreas executes the order, you will need to dive into IEEPA a little bit (IEEPA, 50 USCS Sec 1701), as well as OFAC's Enforcement Guidelines (74 FR 57593-09).
There are also at least a dozen other Federal Regulations that the SecTreas and OFAC must adhere to when imposing sanctions on any person or entity.  
Here's a list to start with:  
* TWEA, 50 USCS Sec 5.  
* 31 CFR 501 Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations.  
* 68 FR 53640-03 - Civil Penalties Rights and Procedures for the Cuba Sanctions Program.  
* 68 FR 61359-03 - Implementation of requirement under the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990.  
* 70 FR 15761-05 - Administrative Collection of Civil Penalties in the Iranian Assets Control Regulations, the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, and the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations.  
* 71 FR 29251-06 - revised regulations to reflect amendments to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) made by the Combating Terrorism Financing Act of 2005.  
* 73 FR 32650-08  - Final Rule amending civil penalty provisions in 17 parts of the regulations OFAC administers, specifically those for which the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”) provides civil penalty authority.  
**ONE HUGE CAVEAT:**  
It should be noted that the even bigger threat to sanctions-related due process was the **2001 Patriot Act**. Sadly, in it they modified IEEPA to empower the Treasury to freeze/seize all assets of persons or entities who are simply *under investigation/consideration* to be added to the SDN -- and then **only if** they are being investigated for the *Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT)* designation, specifically.
The SDGT designation was created by **President W. George Bush** when he signed **EO 13224** that declared a national emergency based on the 9/11 attacks and directed Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and Secretary of State, to designated SDGTs and take action to freeze all assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Designation may be of a terrorist organization, or if Treasury finds a group has:  
* Provided material support to an SDGT
* To be "otherwise associated with an SDGT (defined in subsequent regulations as owned or controlled by an SDGT or to act for or on behalf of it).  
So, how does this affect the recent cyber-related EO?  As of right now, it doesn't. However, if you hear rumblings of Congress amending the Patriot Act or IEEPA, specifically, in order to create the same lack of due process for cyber-related designees, THEN we can all get angry and bust out the pitchforks -- and I'll be right there beside you.
As it stands, though, *cyber-related designees* still require a full investigation before they're added to the SDN -- unless, of course, their actions are also designated as terrorism. In which case, they'd be targeted under the authority of Bush's terrorism EO and the Patriot Act, not the latest cyber-related EO from Obama. 
At the end of the day, though, other U.S. persons and businesses WILL NOT be targeted for prosecution or have their assets frozen unless/until they do business with (or donate to) entities or persons AFTER they are added to the SDN list. All of the regulations governing the repercussions of doing so clearly say that much.
IOW, you can't get in trouble (as a result of this EO, specifically) if the other party's name isn't in the SDN list.
Then again, there are still much older "aiding and abetting known fugitive" laws that they could use to fuck you up, so it may be possible that none of the above even matters...

No he didn't. He simply pointed out one more feature for those who wish to send to someone who happens to have a Circle account.
It's just one more feature of the system they're building.
The real point is that you can use the account to send money to anyone, anywhere on the planet, for almost free and almost instantly, regardless of whether or not that recipient uses Circle.
If that recipient uses Circle, then yes, it works like Venmo. However, what are the chances your cousin in Uganda gas a Circle account? In this case, he doesn't need one. He can receive actual Bitcoin and do with then whatever he wishes.
For practically free, and almost instantly.

None of those three names are on the official SDN list; so no, they CANNOT leverage the new EO to freeze or seize **your** assets if you donate to them right now.
You still don't understand how these official sanctions work. They cannot seize or freeze YOUR assets unless you donate to them AFTER their names have been added to the official SDN list -- which, of course, they haven't been.
If you continue to donate after a party has been identified and added to the list, then yes, at that point and only that point, you  yourself could have your assets frozen or seized.

In the U.S., the word "cable" is still commonly used to describe any paid TV service, regardless of the medium used to deliver said service.
Satellite, fiber, coax -- it doesn't matter. The box that sits next to your TV is still referred to as a "cable box" by most people.
It should also be noted that some fiber services still convert their transmissions to coax using optical network terminals in each residence. The signal is then transmitted throughout the residence to each STB using the legacy coax cables that are already in all the walls.
Only newly constructed homes tend to have internal fiber unless a homeowner pays to have an older home rewired.
TL;DR - In the U.S., "cable" is still synonymous with any paid TV service that installs a STB in your home. It's a language and generational thing.

Correct. They don't use **cash**.
Please see the title of Satoshi's white paper if my use of the word 'cash' is confusing.
I consider the actual Bitcoin blockchain the virtual equivalent of a pile of cash, and all of the Coinbases, Circles, and Lightning Networks of the world are equivalent to the USD-based systems and services you mentioned -- all of which use something other than cash to represent and transact your funds.

Anyone who describes Bitcoin as an "anonymous currency" is flat wrong. At best, it's a pseudononymous currency, and then again only if you by it with cash.
Otherwise, you have to take some pretty technical steps involving mixers and possibly other crypto currencies to make your holdings anything close to anonymous.
Seriously, when the media or your friends call it anonymous, they're factually incorrect.

To be fair, *some* construction does get priced by the square foot. That is augmented, of course, by the quality and quantity of custom work.
So, perhaps we can look at this payment method as the "base" funding, and then other more specific payments can be made to the devs who go above and beyond with "custom quality work." Those additional "bonuses" can be paid by both corporate and private donations using some other method?
Just brainstorming...

I agree with all of the above; but, ONLY if said Layer 2 options provide the same level of Bitcoin's trustlessness (or more).

That's absolutely correct. However, you'll never see Ripple Labs make that exact distinction in the media pieces or hearings they're invited to.
There's a reason they completely avoid making that distinction; because, at the end of the day, their Ivy League boardmembers KNOW that Ripple is nothing more than Fiat v1.5., and that it's *nothing* like Bitcoin.

You are correct. They're actually just using a slightly modified version of Peercoin.
They claim that their two "major" innovations are:  
1) Distribution model that will encourage more adoption by average consumers, and  
2) a modified version of Proof-of-stake that allegedly fixes the problems suffered by every other PoS coin on the market.  
In other words, they're just another (albeit more organized) shitcoin...
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:03:05
Wrong. There's no such thing as "IOU Bitcoin" in this situation. The dollars you convert to Bitcoin can instantly be sent anywhere -- including your own private wallets or any other Bitcoin address of your choosing.
The only real difference between this and anything else is that you no longer have to transfer your USD from a different bank in order to buy new Bitcoin. Hell, you could probably set this up as your ONLY bank in the near future, and then go in and out of Bitcoin anytime you wish.
Key paragraph:  


If they add online bill paying, I'll probably close all of my other checking accounts and have my paychecks deposited directly to Circle. I'll probably then instantly convert something like 10% of every paycheck into Bitcoin and withdraw it to my own private Bitcoin wallets.
Remember, the main goal is to neuter centralized banking, not all private banking and payment processors.

For the record, you're one of the few who *has* been clear (even blunt) about your intentions, reasoning, etc. You've also helped put some of the challenges and arguments into perspective for me.
At the end of the day, I won't (can't) argue with the protocol and technological limitations you and others have identified -- although, I will argue with some that have merely been *theorized* -- and, I certainly understand and appreciate our need to maintain decentralization (p2p).

Actually, it was the mere *possibility* of a very specific type of miner-vs-miner attack that inspired the installation of the temporary 1MB limit. (it was NOT installed to prevent the type of tx spam we've seen in the stress tests).
There have also been several other changes made or proposed for the entire system since then (ie. relay network, IBLT, SPV, etc) that would make such attacks much less likely or effective. 
That said, most of the proposed solutions still include caps that would prevent such attacks, just as the 1mb limit prevented them four years ago.

That's how official sanctions work -- and, coincidentally, it's also one of the reasons pseudo-political figures like Snowden probably won't be added. 
Every company or person who regularly does business internationally should already be familiar with the official SDN list.
Trust me, you'll also be made well aware if/when major personalities like Snowden or Kim Dotcom get added to the list.
It's up to everyone to do the due diligence when they're considering donations to wanted international fugitives or organizations that may be in bad standing with the U.S. government.
Is it reasonable to expect "normal" people to remain aware of such developments? Maybe not, but I think you'll probably be just fine if you use a little common sense with who you go into business with or send money to.

To be fair, yes, they *could* actually make their own blockchain very easily. Hundreds of alt coin developers have done so.
The question, of course, is how they plan to secure it without any sort of financial incentive mechanism for the participating nodes.
@_date: 2015-09-14 01:08:00

@_date: 2015-09-17 19:33:04
It all comes down to incentives. If they can come up with an incentive to participate that isn't monetary in nature, they could create a reasonably decentralized blockchain.
However, I haven't seen **any** of these companies demonstrate any other working incentive structures that don't ultimately result in a centralized ~~"blockchain"~~ database.

The cost of scaling web services rises very quickly, as well, and there is no lack of participation and competition in that market.
You also didn't answer the question I asked. 
Userbase K will lead to Company base Y, which could lead to full node count Y.
As I said, Bitcoin-related businesses have very strong incentives to run dedicated full nodes of their own. If we can agree that exponentially more users will lead to more companies competing to serve said users, then we'll also see more companies with very strong incentives to run full nodes of their own.
@_date: 2015-09-04 01:16:42

Also, my entire point all along has been that Snowden isn't *currently* on the list. Therefore, donating to him right now won't get you into trouble *as a result of this EO, specifically.* (there are certainly other "aiding and abetting a known fugitive" laws that may apply, though, so tread carefully).
The government could certainly use this EO to target Snowden or other insiders **in the future**; but, that was never my point or my intention.

The origin, destination, and suspected purpose of any tx should never be a factor that users encourage miners to use when deciding which tx to mine or prioritize.
What next? Will users encourage or support large miners that refuse to mine (or lower the priority of) tx that are merely **suspected** of going to Wikileaks? Or to the Hillary Clinton campaign? Or to ISIS?

The question is whether "it's the only way forward" because it's actually the *best* option, or is it simply because it's the *only* option Core itself is willing to provide?
You cannot deny that the vast majority of users (and even miners) don't truly understand the technical pros/cons of each proposed solution to scaling, so you also cannot deny that most of both of those groups continue to support Core's proposals simply because it's *perceived as* easier and safer to do so.

I chose to skip the tax penalty with "pay it later," but the additional penalty is about 10%.  All told, given my likely tax bracket, my total tax+penalty for state+federal will be roughly 26%.
You can also take loans against your own retirement accounts that incur much smaller penalties or none at all. I went that route back in 2013, made a fantastic profit, and paid the loan back (to myself) without any issues.

Obfuscation disguises the point of origin. It doesn't hide the transaction from the blockchain itself.

First, define "decentralized" in the context you're using it. Are you referring to consensus, or simply the storage of said data?
Second, tell me who or what determines consensus for what is added to your new magic database, and how said entity arrives at consensus?
Finally, demonstrate that your new magic consensus mechanisms are incorruptible. 
Until you accomplish and/or explicitly address all of the above, I'm going to call bullshit on your claim. :)

Who will control access to the closed system?
That will be the "single master."


The immutable feature of Bitcoin's blockchain is derived from its permissionless nature. How will banks establish a similar immutable ledger in a system that involves centrally managed access controls (aka trust)?


The same is easily accomplished using timestamps and a robust federated database.

@_date: 2017-05-30 02:29:28
I'm sorry, but that reason doesn't really stand up to scrutiny.  
The quadratic hashing issue can be easily mitigated by limiting the size of **transactions** in the hardfork.  Gavin's BIP109 includes the code that limits transaction size to 1MB for *exactly* that purpose, and it works wonderfully with any blocksize. (This solution has been known since 2015).
Are there problems with the BIP109 solution to this problem that I'm not aware of?
If not, then Luke's 2MB hardcap is completely unnecessary, and you're going to have come up with a much better reason not to provide the ~4MB blocks we'd otherwise expect to see with this linear increase.

Ok, I can see that being somewhat useful.
However, their success will likely be short-lived because there are already others who are building trading/settlement engines to accomplish all of the above using actual bitcoins, multi-sig wallets, and the blockchain itself as the basis for all trades and settlements.

The innovation on dumb networks takes place entirely at the edge. Net Neutrality ensures that the Internet pipes remain dumb, and that all of the intelligence and innovations remain on the edge.

I think you're going to soon find out that most, like me, had/have completely different expectations for the linear increase described by the term, "2MB+SW."
The stakeholders, like me, are going to expect the ~4MB blocks that **should** naturally result from setting Base Size to 2000000 bytes and Total Weight to 8000000 bytes.
I can almost guarantee that nobody is going to accept Luke's decision to install an arbitrary hardcap at 2MB.

@_date: 2017-05-04 14:25:04


SegWit doesn't adjust the fees the miners require for transaction processing.
The 75% "discount" in SegWit is an accounting trick for how the tx data itself is measured against the 1,000,000 byte base size maximum, not the miner fees.
With SegWit, miners are still free to impose any fee structure they wish for the tx they include in a block.

It's my understanding that GBTC and COIN are functionally different in the following ways:  
GBTC is backed by ~138k coins that are already owned by investors as BIT shares -- each share representing 1/10 of a bitcoin. Those investors are required to hold on to their BIT shares for a minimum of 12 months before they're allowed to sell them on the open market --which will now be facilitated using GBTC on the OTC Market(s). Therefore, those existing BIT shareholders are the sole source of initial liquidity for all GBTC trading. This situation may lead to a *very* inactive GBTC market if nobody with BIT shares wants to sell.
COIN, on the other hand, has exactly 200k coins that will be split into exactly one million shares in their IPO -- each share representing 1/5 off a bitcoin. Nobody owns any of those shares yet, so they'll all be instantly available once trading begins on NASDAQ.
Please correct me if I'm wrong! :)

Actually, LN will require additional funding for every channel (kinda like escrow). Most of said funding will be provided by corporations who are running custom channels of one sort, or another. Their goal, of course, will be to earn profits on every LN transaction that uses their channels -- the LN tx fees will be similar to, but certainly not the same as, mining fees. The fees will also be used by those corps to pay the mining fees for every settlement tx on the actual blockchain.
You should check out their white paper. LN will absolutely involve centrally owned/controlled channels -- especially at the merchant end of every path. End users and merchants will have to choose who their primary channel providers are based on the perks, speed, redundancy, costs, etc -- a Lightning Network Service Provider (LNSP), if you will.
While ISP's provide service to end users and services over "the last mile" to each home or business, the LNSP's will provide the channels to end users and services in a similar fashion. Each tx path will likely involve multiple LNSPs -- each with their own set of (hopefully compatible and acceptable) rules and fees.
Some of the LNSP's may even require AML/KYC for every channel they provide, but hopefully the free market prevents that from becoming the norm. Don't be surprised when governments make it mandatory for merchant LNSP's, though. :(

Do you understand what the terms **vulnerability, exploit, and attack** mean in the context of **information security**?
Any use of the covert boosting method would be considered a **cryptographic attack** on Bitcoin's PoW *process*.
The idea here, from a security perspective, is to prevent such attacks whenever possible. In this case, that involves simply patching the **vulnerability** discovered in the PoW process.
It is in no way comparable to the advent of dedicated FPGAs or asics, and it's certainly not an "optimization."

Negligent vs. Malicious?  Do you have any evidence to suggest that their current node configuration was accidental?
These guys aren't noobs setting up their first node. They're *very* experienced Bitcoin developers who have been building nodes for *years.*
These nodes were intentionally configured to act in a way that is KNOWN to be detrimental to every other node on the network that connects to them. How could such a decision and intentional configuration be considered simple negligence?
My guess is that they did it to save money on node bandwidth -- which would mean that it was intentional.
Again, though, we're both just guessing unless you reveal some sort of proof that the entire thing was an accident.
@_date: 2015-03-14 02:21:58
Here's the problem: central banks don't currently have a widely distributed and completely transparent ledger that would allow every node (financial institutions) to create smart contracts.  
Instead, they have various databases that can't realistically be replicated and completely accessed by every financial institution at will. The acess to their databases is tightly controlled and extremely limiting.
A **distributed and transparent ledger** would absolutely be more powerful than what they have today since it would allow every financial institution to plug in and create **smart contracts** in ways that are very similar to how we'd do so with decentralized Bitcoin (or ethereum) blockchains.
In other words, it's not completely far-fetched that they could build something *resembling* the Bitcoin blockchain without the trustless pseudononymous aspects; and, that such a system would still be vastly superior to the many database systems they currently use -- systems that could never handle smart contracts involving random nodes in their network.
Exercise: imagine Bitcoin with just one ambivalent (and rational) mining entity that we all trusted without question. 
That's what a central bank blockchain would look like since all of the participating nodes and users (financial institutions) already implicitly trust their central banks. They have to.
It's akin to one mining company taking control of Bitcoin -- such as in a 51% attack -- but then, after blacklisting every other miner, doing nothing else "nefarious" to the *users*.
The transaction confirmations and programmability would still exist and function perfectly fine; but, of course, we'd have to give up the psuedonymity and trustless aspects of Bitcoin -- neither of which are of any importantance to financial institutions. In fact, they all want the *exact opposite* of that! 
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:30:46
I personally have no problem with it because it completely "validates" Bitcoin technology, and it would become much easier to trade between the two. Once validated and understood by the public, Bitcoin would finally become the "gold" of the crypto world -- in other words, it would become the decentralized store of wealth outside of government control that precious metals could be considered today; which, coincidentally, still exist alongside fiat currencies without much issue.
FedCoins don't threaten Bitcoin's ability to reach a global audience, and I foresee a future when thousands or millions of competing/interchangeable digital currencies exist for a multitude of purposes (use cases).
IMO, by creating and endorsing their own crypto currency, the Feds would be further opening Pandora's Box.

Nope, it's all done using only bitcoins and multi-sig wallets. There is no alt coin involved at all -- which is why the name he chose for the platform is unfortunate, at least within our crypto community.
He's been on the whaleclub teamspeak server several times discussing and demonstrating the platform. We've also told him the name sucks! LOL. To that point, he said that he has a rebranding strategy ready to go if the large Wall Street bankers and trading houses (his intended customers) don't like the name either.
The platform isn't just for derivatives and futures -- it's built to trade literally anything and everything available on any market. You can use your imagination to propose any trade pair you want, and apply leverage accordingly to hedge any/all of them.
The Ultracoin platform doesn't use colored coins. It uses a programmable escrow mechanism built on/with vanilla bitcoins as the basis for every trade and settlement.

I agree with that 100%! :)
As for transparency, I was referring to just the ledger (blockchain). They could certainly keep everything else secret (or try), but the shared ledger would have to be released -- at least to their authorized "full nodes" -- in order to get any of the other pieces (like smart contracts and accounting) to work.
Another possibility is that Congress could pass a law that forces the Fed to create a FedCoin.info block explorer website. Why? Because Congress would absolutely f'n LOVE to be able to audit the Fed at will!

They actually are.. slowly.  Those who aren't trading anything yet simply need two things:  
1) a safer (more regulated and familiar) place to trade, and  
2) more liquidity.  
The first of those is undeniably already happening, and the second will happen naturally as a result of the first.
The "big money" doesn't deal in anything less than millions, or possibly even billions, so guess what else needs to happen before they fully commit?  
A higher price.
There is no doubt that they're coming this way, though. That much is practically guaranteed at this point. It's just a matter of time and those two items I listed above building to a crescendo.

@_date: 2015-03-26 22:20:11
That's a different process altogether. For that, you would need to be an **accredited investor** and work directly with BIT. I also believe there may be a $25k minimum, but I'm not entirely sure about that.
The real problem with going that route is that direct BIT investment requires you to hold your BIT shares for a minimum of 12 months before you're allowed to transfer them to GBTC and sell them.
That obviously wouldn't work for arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:39:19
Fair enough, but I wouldn't think the term "impossible" would be appropriate in that case.

@_date: 2015-03-27 01:34:18
I said as much above: "**Current** BIT holders..."
And, the time frame you're referring to is 12 months. The good news is that I've heard roughly 85% of current BIT holders have already held for 12+ months. I'm not sure if that number is still accurate, but it may be a large enough number holders to provide a decent supply if/when the bids become tempting enough.

I understand completely that they can issue unlimited shares (in baskets of 100) based on demand.
However, without any liquidity on OTCQX, due to a complete lack of new shares at launch, how do you suppose they'll establish demand?
Do you expect to see GBTC order books filled up with spot-price bids and no asks?
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:37:53

Even in a centralized system, the ledger (blockchain) itself could still be completely accessible, transparent, and auditable by every participating node.  
In this case, only the core code and node access would be centrally managed, not the distributed ledger itself. The ledger itself would be distributed and shared with/by every participating (and *authorized*) node.
Think of it this way: after a successful 51% attack on Bitcoin by one mining company, the blockchain itself would still be completely visible and auditable by everyone else. We would simply be at the mercy of that (now centralized) mining company with regards to the code, node authorization, and transaction approval.
With Bitcoin, that obviously won't work, and we'd all switch to something else.
However, with a FedCoin, all of the authorized nodes/users are forced to trust the central bank, so they could/would control everything -- to include only allowing known financial institutions to become full nodes and/or additional miners.

I understand what he meant, though, so it shouldn't be too difficult to adjust the language of his draft BIP to match his intentions.  Better yet, since his idea is essentially a complete hardfork replacement for the current SW softfork, maybe he could even redefine those variables to better fit the proposed "DGov" structure and gradual increases?


It appears that he did submit it to the dev mailing list on 5 April, but nobody ever commented on it. It also seems like a legitimate proposal, though, so maybe you could reach out and help him with your BIP process?

How? The backlog is comprised entirely of legacy transactions, so I'm curious to know how/why you believe SegWit activation would somehow speed up the inclusion of those backlogged tx in new blocks. 
I'm not attacking SegWit -- I'm all for it -- but, I personally don't believe (or understand how) it would have an immediate affect on the current backlog. The backlogged tx will still be competing for space in the same 1,000,000 bytes allocated for both legacy tx and new SegWit tx headers.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:10:06


Agreed. 


I think you're putting words into my mouth. A lot of them.
That said, I'm personally looking forward to decentralized layer 2 and layer 3 developments, and I'm patient enough to wait for them.
That doesn't mean I'm happy with where we are, compared to where we've been, but I can deal with it... for a time.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:58:47
The reason I say that is because the agreement isn't/wasn't exactly precise in its terms. Some, like me, took it to mean a base block increase to 2MB **in addition to** the full SegWit 3:1 ratio and 75% discount, thus resulting in blocks that have Total Weights between 0 and 8000000 bytes (depending on the composition of tx within each block).  
The real world results would basically be a 2x reflection of current 1MB+SW results -- so, roughly 3.9 to 4.2MB average blocks.
Instead, Luke took the opportunity to inject his typical ultra-conservative approach that now results in a ~2MB maximum across the board. Luke's opinion and approach aren't unexpected, but where do all the other Core devs stand on this one? Will they support Luke's conservative approach, or will they fall more in line with the rest of the community to support ~4MB average block sizes? (Which is what I think is/was expected with this compromise)
I'm concerned that Luke's conservative approach will cause the entire "agreement" to crumble, as it is now really easy for the Big Block camp to point to this situation and say *"Hey, this
isn't really 2MB+SW! This is just like Luke's ridiculous 300kb proposal from last year. Core is trying to trick everyone again!"*
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:03:17

Not *all* the benefits. A closed system would still:

Low-priced bitcoins can't handle large b2b transactions (once the loop is closed with manufacturers, retail merchants, and users).
Example: If you're trying to send $50 Million USD to a widget manufacturer in China, it would require 200,000 bitcoins (right now) to make the transfer possible.  
On the other hand, you could easily make the same transfer with just 500 bitcoins if they were worth $100k USD each.

My favorite: I was at a restaurant with several people after a fairly large Bitcoin event. One of the guys with us turned out to be a huge Ripple supporter who had recently incorporated with plans to partner with Ripple Labs. He was going on and on about it during dinner. The guy sitting next to him was his primary investor who had even paid for their whole trip to the event.
I then laid into him with technical facts, logic, and tore Ripple to shreds for about 45 minutes straight. He stuttered and flailed without answers, and his investor finally asked everyone else at the table if I was correct about everything.
They all said yes.
At that point, the investor looked at the guy and told him he no longer wanted to invest in his company. The Ripple fanatic stood up and left the restaurant angry as hell -- even told me to go fuck myself! LOL
I then sat and had drinks with the investor for the next four hours discussing Bitcoin... and my own company. :)

In this case, the OP was offering a 5% discount for using bitcoin.
Even with the 1.74% conversion/exchange rate Circle was imposing (using fees hidden in their exchange rate), the customer still would have received a net 3.26% discount on the product.
Discounts for using bitcoin will need to become the norm to encourage more rapid adoption.

I've seen use the phrase "technically impossible" a few times today. I think he was talking about the inability to force anyone to hardfork, but I could be wrong. If that's the case, then he's correct, as you can't force anyone to run any software. However, I don't think that would make the entire development of BTC1's software "technically impossible," which is what I've seen implied elsewhere.

5. Trade for Dash (DRK).  
6. Withdraw to personal DRK wallet.  
7. Conduct several DRK transfers to fresh personal DRK wallets.  
8. Transfer to a new account on another non-KYC crypto-to-crypto exchange created and accessed only through Tor. (or use Coin4coin).

BIP148 is a last resort option that is mistakenly being marketed as a preemptive strike (similar in nature to a PoW change).

The problem is that the word "bit" now has several different meanings, and they're all computer-related.
Hell, even computer programmers themselves already talk about "overhead costs," in terms of memory bits and bandwidth, so there we go again confusing "costs" and "bits."
Trust me, this is going to confuse a lot of people. Your example above merely reinforces that fact.

As it stands right now, there will be just under 2.1 quadrillion satoshis available (once everything is mined). 
The ONLY reason to add additional decimal places is if/when one (1) satoshi becomes too valuable to use for pricing cheap items -- which is theoretically possible with a deflationary currency.
In other words, if whole bitcoins ultimately obtain so much purchasing power (value) that even just one(1) satoshi is too much to pay for one(1) candy bar, we would need to add an additional sub-unit or two to handle such small purchases.
What you have to remember, though, is that doing so does NOT by itself affect (raise) the purchasing power (value) of anyone's existing holdings. That total purchasing power (value) would not change at all. The new sub-units would merely facilitate cheaper purchases, nothing more.

The supply chain would obviously include confirmations at every stage, including the physical delivery of the ketchup to the front door. Only conflicts or confirmation delays (beyond x days, perhaps) would need to go to third-party arbitration.

I like to think of the whole thing as "interesting," and I'm not at all worried about any long-term BIT holders selling their shares.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:27:34
"  as soon as existing $GBTC shareholders deposit shares in their brokerage accounts and elect to sell"  
"  to elaborate, shareholders that have held for 12 months are eligible to sell"  
"   live now, but we have no control as to when/if eligible shareholders deposit their shares and sell"
As I've said in the past, this entire GBTC event may be very underwhelming compared to the upcoming COIN IPO that will include 1,000,000 new shares on the market at the Winkdex price on day 1. 
The only way GBTC would get genuinely interesting (or exciting) is if BIT decides to issue more shares (IOW buy more baskets of coins), but I'm really not sure how/when/if that will even happen.

I've been an Information security professional for almost 20 years now.
This isn't a case of obscurity -- it's more a combination of various proven techniques meant only to thwart the current investigative capabilities of any potential adversaries in hopes of at least being partially successful.
It's akin to using three different logically and geographically separate mixing services instead of just one so that a compromise of one wouldn't compromise the whole.
Also, some of the most interesting new security tools I've seen lately involve intentional obscurity -- such as hiding critical systems or data in plain site amongst thousands of decoys -- so, I wouldn't be so quick to point to the old "security through obscurity is always bad" adage as though it's an infallible truth. I saw the entire concept flipped on its head to great effect by a few DARPA's infosec projects revealed last year at DARPA Day 2014... ;)

What I mean is, the current charter mandates that only two things are accomplished -- SegWit activation and the 2MB hardfork. Anything else that could be added is considered out of scope, or "not in the charter," so it is automatically rejected or shelved until after the dust from the hardfork settles.
Following the hardfork, I suspect that the entire BTC1 repo will begin to operate much more like Core's repo, as any reasonable PR will then be reviewed, discussed at length, and potentially merged. The charter will no longer be the left and right boundaries for the project, and all rational ideas and features will be welcomed with open arms.
tl;dr - Right now, the two-part NYA charter is all that matters. The code is designed to implement those two items -- nothing more and nothing less. That will no longer be the case after the hardfork; so, as with the Core repo, the possibilities at that point become endless.

I see the flaw you're describing, but perhaps that could be mitigated by the first action of the contract (at the time of creation) being to initiate a freeze on the required amounts in both accounts.
The final action, then, would unfreeze both accounts immediately before initiating the payment from one of them.
Ok... perhaps that's not workable... I'll do some more thinking on an example that work without the escrow itself internally holding a token of value.

Just as normal BIP141 (1MB+SW) results in average blocks that are ~2MB, the linear base size increase from 1 -&gt; 2MB should naturally result in average blocks that are ~4MB.


You just might be the only human being alive who believes that.
A 4MB hard limit might make sense, but there's no chance in hell your 2MB cap will be acceptable to the parties involved in this agreement. To them, and me, "2MB+SW" means a 2x linear increase from BIP141.
Are you intentionally sabotaging this BIP?

Very high with the hardfork several months from now, but any split before then won't be a result of SegWit2x.
The UASF may still cause a split on August 1st, and BitcoinABC has an intentional "big block" split scheduled for that date, as well.

They have 60+ large economic nodes that support the compromise, and counting -- including at least 80% of the hashpower and an untold number of "moderate" users like myself.
Collectively, I don't think all of the above can rightfully be described as limited or low levels of support.
By any measure, SegWit2x has a very high chance for success -- and certainly higher than any option outside of SegWit-only.
The good news is that I think we'll at least get SegWit, so that is not a bad "worst case" at all.
Tentatively, though, I do honestly think the SegWit2x hardfork has a high chance of success, as well.

@_date: 2017-05-27 21:11:33


That pipedream breaks down once you realize that ~55+% of the U.S. population pay no Federal income taxes **at all**.  
So, it's actually a case of only ~45% of the population paying for 100% of the Federal government salaries, equipment, facilities, pensions, and programs.
And then there's the fact that the U.S. population is more than 330 million people; so, the social and single-payer solutions implemented in other countries (Canada, England, Australia, Germany, etc) do not scale well at all when fewer than 150 million people have to pay the full costs for the entire 330+ million population.
This is a very hard problem that can't simply be solved by higher taxes, lollipops, and unicorn dreams.
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:48:34
I believe they're avoiding any voiced support for a UASF because they've said all along that **safety** is paramount -- and UASF's can't honestly be described as conservatively "safe." Direct support for a UASF would essentially nullify that original position, so I don't think there's much chance they will do so -- at least, not any time soon.
They also don't need to support a UASF for it to happen.

Investor Letter — March 02, 2015 I info
OTCQX® Update
We are pleased to announce that the Bitcoin Investment Trust's shares (BIT) have been assigned the ticker symbol GBTC by FINRA in connection with its approval of the Form 15c-211 filed by the BIT's market maker. The BIT's sponsor is now finalizing the process of obtaining approval from OTC Markets to allow BIT shares that have been held for at least 12 months to be quoted on OTCQX®, the top marketplace operated by OTC Markets Group, under the Alternative Reporting Standards. In addition, the BIT's sponsor is in the process of making the shares DTC-eligible to facilitate trading once it commences.
We anticipate that the BIT's shares will be eligible to be quoted on OTCQX® and DTC-eligible during the next few weeks, although we can make no guarantees as to exact timing. It is important to note the price of shares traded on OTCQX® will be established by market bids and asks and will not necessarily reflect the BIT's NAV/share or the spot price of bitcoin. In addition, no assurances can be given as to whether an active public secondary market for the shares will develop or be maintained.
As always, qualified accredited investors may choose to invest in shares of the BIT directly through the BIT's ongoing private placement at the daily NAV/share^^1. Please note that BIT shares purchased through the ongoing private placement are subject to significant resale and transferability limitations and will not be eligible to be sold on OTCQX® until held for more than one year. BIT shares purchased on OTCQX®, however, are freely tradable once purchased.
Steps to Sell Shares on OTCQX®
Once we obtain the necessary approvals to enable the BIT shares to be quoted on OTCQX®, we will send you further details. In the meantime, please see some information that will be of interest to investors that have held BIT shares for at least 12 months and who will be eligible sell those shares on OTCQX®.
Our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust, will be mailing each eligible shareholder a share ownership statement.
This statement will include instructions on how to have your shares electronically transferred via Direct Registration System (DRS) to the broker of your choice.
Once your shares have been transferred to your brokerage account, you will be able to place an order to sell your shares.
Shareholders may continue to hold their shares in DRS book-entry form with Continental if they so choose.
If you have any questions regarding your share ownership statement, if your address has recently changed, or if you have any other questions at this time regarding transferring your shares to your own brokerage account, please contact Continental at (800) 509-5586 or (212) 509-4000.
As always, please also do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns about this process.
To the extent that you do not already have a personal brokerage account and would like to establish one, we would be happy to put you in contact with Merriman Capital, the broker dealer that is both the BIT's initial market maker and its Designated Advisor for Disclosure (DAD).
^^1 The BIT's NAV/share will be published each U.S. business day on the sponsor's website:

You can't use retirement funds to buy bitcoin unless you withdraw the money from the retirement account and suffer huge early-withdrawal tax penalties.
Bitcoin-based ETFs will allow you to invest in an instrument using the funds in your retirement account, so you can invest in something that should increase/decline in value as Bitcoin increases/declines in value. The obvious benefit is that you get to skip all of the withdrawal tax penalties.

High bitcoin price AND high fees right now... what's their incentive to change?
Current miner resistance to SegWit (or ANY upgrade) has little or nothing to do with technical objections.
It's all about money, and my bet is that the current situation seems optimal *to them*.
In other words, they want this stagnation to continue -- at least as long as the price stays as high as it is, or continues to go even higher.  Miners like Bitmain that back BU are probably only doing so because they know it leads to continued stagnation. They don't really like BU or hate SegWit -- they simply prefer the current money to keep flowing in.
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:12:10

It would also:  
- make trades between Bitcoin/FedCoin into "like-kind" trades...good luck IRS!    
- lead to many more hardware wallets that are compatible with any cryptocurrency.  
- lead to more registers and POS software offerings that are compatible with cryptocurrencies.  
- further encourage everyone to treat Bitcoin, like gold, as a store of wealth outside of central control (due to Bitcoin's known scarcity).    
- lead to a better understanding and appreciation among consumers for ALL crypto currencies.

I don't get it.

Where are the savings if/when the legacy banking system is still involved in the entire process?

*"Oh, you really enjoy that brand new video service that just started last month? Well, we're sorry to inform you that they refused to pay our fees for faster content delivery, so you're just going to have to stick to using our Verizon movie rental service instead..."*
The point is that ISPs could and would abuse their oligopolies to directly suppress competition and innovation.

I should have been more clear. I was not referring to the literal printing of physical money.
The vast majority of new dollars injected into the market during the last decade were the result of several rounds of Quantitative Easing. The Federal Reserve that made those monetary policy decisions does NOT require approval for said decisions from Congress or the President.
In fact, the Federal Government has absolutely no control over the Federal Reserve -- which itself is a private entity that exists outside of the U.S. government's three branches, regardless of the various committees that include Federal employees.
So yes, while Congress has the enumerated power to physically print money, they actually haven't been the ones adding "new dollars" to the market for the last decade.

I consult to major financial institutions for a living on the issues of information security, emergent technologies and threats, and even digital currencies -- with a focus on the design and implementation of secure environments.
I have yet to see any one of my clients create a viable or working private blockchain. Hell, most of them hardly understand what the words *digital currency* or *blockchain* even mean -- and that's within their CIO/CTO organizations!
I think you're very wrong about what is possible with private blockchains, and I won't believe otherwise until you or the banks prove me wrong with a **viable** and **working** system that utilizes an actual blockchain that it's more useful or efficient than traditional federated databases.

First, the "total number of usable bitcoin" never EVER changes. "Bitcoin" is a defined unit, so that number is fixed at just under 21 million total bitcoins (once everything is mined). No more, no less. You could add 1000 zeroes to the right of the decimal point, and that 21 million total available bitcoins would never change.
Adding another decimal place simply increases the number of SUB-units available, NOT the number of whole "bitcoins."
It sounds like your issue is with deflationary currencies themselves -- consistently rising purchasing power per unit -- not divisibility.
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:22:15
That's actually not true. *Every* individual trade to fiat on the Bitcoin exchanges is a taxable event for U.S. citizens, not just cashing out at the end. You must maintain records of *every single trade involving fiat* for tax purposes.
Only crypto-to-crypto trades are non-taxable events since they're all considered "like kind" commodities.

The banks will notice if the merchants make large cash deposits, so they'll likely file their suspicions with the government. At that point, the government may decide to audit said merchants, which is when they'll need to produce their books and receipts for every large purchase.

Get one of the more complete kits on Amazon and you're all set. The only real limitation is the 10/100 Ethernet, but that should still be fine for most home broadband connections if you connect it directly to the router.
You can also add a gigabit ethernet USB dongle if you really want more bandwidth, but that would only get you to just over 200 Mbps due to limitations in the USB 2.0 shared bus system. Again, though, you likely won't have that much bandwidth with home broadband connections anyway.

Absolutely false. At no time have I stated or implied that "goods become cheaper due to deflation."

It wasn't necessarily the unspent Bitcoin in user accounts that was the issue -- that can be easily handled using multi-sig user wallets.

You are correct that it would not be immutable -- the central bank could manipulate it at will. I don't know why I included that... derp.
However, there are more bank branches in the U.S. alone than there are full nodes in the Bitcoin network. If every participating branch becomes an "authorized" full node or miner, then the blockchain would be even more *distributed* than Bitcoin. 
Put it this way: a centralized FedCoin will look and act EXACTLY like Bitcoin would look and act after a successful 51% attack by a single semi-ambivalent mining entity. 
The ONLY functional difference would be the total elimination of the trustlessness. All of the other blockchain functionality would still be there.
So, while you and I would likely despise and avoid such a system as much as possible, general consumers and financial institutions wouldn't care because they ALREADY utilize a system that requires trust in a central authority.

Indeed. The kids that are working on it claim to have explicit mining support from Roger, Jihan, Craig, and John McAfee.
I have no idea if that's true or what it means, in terms of hashpower. 
Should be fun to watch them fall flat on their faces, though! :)

There are no herrings here of any sort or color.
Need I remind you that the blockchain is public, and that there's not much privacy inherent to the protocol itself?  
Such tools are/were inevitable. Believing otherwise would be naive.
Privacy is probably second only to mining centralization, in terms of issues threatening the future of Bitcoin.
Did you really believe that consulting and analytics firms would ignore the market for blockchain analysis tools once every relevant agency and financial institution on the planet took notice of Bitcoin?
It may or may not eventually have an impact on Bitcoin's fungibility; but again, the advent of these tools was inevitable.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:01:18
Do you honestly think the world's largest Bitcoin mining operation actually *buys* coins? That's... a strange theory.
I do believe they short-sell on the markets, but I don't think they're *buying* anything other than more hashpower with their fiat.

We already have, or are currently working on, the tools we need to prevent such thefts. 
Examples include multi-sig wallets, decentralized markets (openbazaar), smart contracts with oracles and arbitrators, reputation systems (bitrated), etc.
I really don't think this particular incident is going to haunt us for very long at all.


Not just no, but hell no. One of Bitcoin's greatest strengths is that all transactions are irreversible.
The technologies I mentioned above (and others) will be the answer, not some centralized "company" that can retroactively manipulate the ledger.
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:45:33
It's not that people shouldn't think about the problem -- it's that there are already many people working on this particular known problem as we speak. 
So, unless you are actually coming up with new ideas and potential solutions, simply harping on them in a public forum over and over again doesn't really help much, does it?
In other words, at this point, people should either be coding or brainstorming fixes, or they just need to chill the hell out while others do those two critical things for them.

The main problem is that **none** of the currently available alternatives are viable long-term solutions that don't accelerate centralization.
That is why it's necessary to install a stop-gap solution (SW and a few other optimizations) while we spend additional time researching (and hopefully discovering) an actual viable solution for on-chain scaling.
Your plan is to accept the only alternative we have right now, and that's simply unacceptable to me because said alternative is critically (and dangerously) flawed.
I reject your plan for that reason.

Primarily because we still don't know where the majority of the MtGox "lost coins" are. Hell, we still don't even know if/when/how they were lost or stolen.
There are a lot of "interesting" addresses associated with Gox, but no real answers to speak of.

There would be nothing preventing them from creating their own exchanges to quickly trade between the various centralized coins, or programming smart contracts that do so without breaking a sweat.

It's simple: the only thing that makes Bitcoin truly interesting (read: technologically profound) is that it provides **trustlessness** and **openness** in a distributed ledger.
If you remove the token of value from the system, limit participation, and grant any central authority the ability to manipulate the entire system, you're left with nothing more than a (potentially very inefficient) centralized federated database.
So, the question becomes: why not use a federated database with an added "smart contract" API instead?
Edit: Picture Bitcoin itself with only ONE miner controlling all aspects of the system. Sure, you could still use it for programmable smart contracts, colored coins, etc; but, would it really be more interesting, or more capable, than a federated database controlled by that and central party? No. No, it wouldn't...

Can you expand on the "sigops linear scaling ddos attack vectors"? Are they a byproduct of, or related to, the quadratic hashing issues that were already addressed in the SW code?
I've been trying to figure out the logic behind Luke's 2MB blocksize cap, and I fear it may become a big issue once Big Blockers realize what he has done there -- it's certainly *not* what anyone has ever meant when asking for "SW+2MB." 
What's the logic? Any info would be appreciated. I'd hate for this to turn into a controversy if/when there's actually a good reason for it.

It's a "pool" in name only.
In reality, it's merely a subsidiary of Bitmain so that they can attempt to obfuscate their actual total hash power.
The equipment and pool identifying itself on the network as "ViaBTC" ultimately belongs to none other than Jihan Wu.
Edit: "probably."
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:26:57
There's no code for the agreement yet, so what do you mean by "on the table now"?  
The concept presented in Oliver's proposal could govern/throttle the rollout of the new agreement, such that the end result -- blocks with a base size of 2000000 bytes and max Total Weight of 8000000 bytes -- is approached in a more conservative manner over the course of X years.
This Consensus 2017 agreement seems like the perfect opportunity to implement something like Oliver's approach, and I think it would be much more acceptable to all stakeholders than Luke's ultra-conservative approach that caps everything at 2MB (which may be viewed as deceptive by many stakeholders).
I'd expect that "later" would refer to a completely different hard fork that implements a long-term, and perhaps more deterministic, solution for on-chain scaling (ie. something like BIP100, or sharding).
After all, this SegWit solution was always meant to be just a stop-gap solution that provides us with the observable data and time we need to develop a better long-term solution for on-chain scaling (per the Core roadmap) -- and that's what Oliver's proposal is/was meant for, as well.

Who? Other non-SegWit2x miners? Or SegWit2x miners? Still confused...
The grace period was added to give non-SegWit miners time to switch to something (anything) that produces SegWit blocks to avoid being rejected after the grace period.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:03:55


I respectfully disagree.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:50:35
That's incorrect.
With SegWit, the tx + witness data is still stored as one big block that varies from 0 to 4MB in size, depending on the composition of tx in each block. The data is segregated within the block using something akin to pointers that link each tx header to its associated witness data. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:39:00


What exactly are you talking about there? The SegWit2x clients follow their own protocol rules just fine, so you're not making much sense.


I literally just wrote above that such a connection is completely unnecessary. The transactions involved in the fork will be created, broadcast, and propagated just like any other transaction on the bitcoin network today. There's nothing unique or special about them at all, other than the fact that some of them may be set for a specific minimum blockheight using *nLockTime*.


That's incorrect. It's the larger than 1MB HF *block* itself that would be considered invalid by legacy nodes, not the individual transactions within that block. 
You're once again not making any sense. Why would any individual tx be considered invalid before the HF activates? The miners use completely normal and valid transactions to create that larger block, not some sort of new or unique transactions.


Ok. 
You must understand, though, that it's really tough to take your criticisms and predictions seriously when a) you haven't reviewed the code itself, and b) nothing you've written above makes any technical sense, so it's clear you don't even understand the simple *concepts* involved, let alone the code.

@_date: 2017-05-29 15:20:37
Have you seen the Cornell research paper that was originally published in March 2016? Their conclusion, at the time, was that the Bitcoin network could support 4MB blocks with very little impact on decentralization. They then recently updated their conclusions using new data that suggests the same is now true for 8MB blocks.
It's just one study, and their methodology may be flawed, but it's still worthy of consideration.
My personal node could handle 4MB at no additional costs to me, but I definitely  understand that I *may* be the exception, not the rule.
I'm just not sure I'd ever use the word "insane" to describe 4MB. However, once we get to 8+, things do begin to look questionable.

Ok, I think I found the root of your problem. You have it completely backwards.
We DO NOT add more decimal *places* when the price of food (things) goes up. 
We only add decimal places when the *value of BTC itself* goes up -- and then again only when 1 satoshi becomes too valuable to properly price and pay for items that are cheaper than 1 satoshi.
Seriously, if this and my USD penny example don't finally get through to you, I'd say you're pretty much beyond all hope...

My point is that there will be no initial public offering for GBTC. They're not issuing *new* shares on day one. 
Initially, the only available shares for purchase will be those that existing BIT shareholders *choose* to sell (if any) through the OTCQX Marketplace; and then only ~85% of the current BIT shareholders are even eligible to sell their shares -- that's the estimate for the number of existing shareholders who have already held their BIT shares for more than 12 months.
That is a completely different situation than the genuine IPO of 1,000,000 new shares we'll see with COIN when it lands on NASDAQ -- each share having an initial price that is equal to 0.2 x Winkdex on the date of their IPO.
So, I'm warning you and everyone reading this that the GBTC launch *may* be much more underwhelming than you've imagined. The liquidity simply won't be there, at least initially, like it will be with COIN.
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:26:28
Ok... you do realize that we're not moving the decimal *point* itself, right?

"Place," not "point."  Get it?
The primary bitcoin decimal *point* doesn't move anywhere. Ever.
1.00000000 BTC simply becomes 1.000000000 BTC. In terms of value, they're both identical.

Absolutely incorrect. Before we added the extra decimal point, our 0.00000001 bought 10 candy bars. The ONLY reason we added the decimal point is because we needed a way to price and buy just 1 candy bar (instead of 10).
The actual price per candy bar DID NOT CHANGE, and neither did the purchasing power of one(1) satoshi!
Seriously, how do you not get this? I mean, holy shit man... your post is so factually incorrect and absurd that I'm beginning to think you're trolling.
@_date: 2015-03-15 11:10:58
That misses the post, though. You still need to convert current fiat to Nubit using the legacy banking system.
With a FedCoin, it may be issued by the banks themselves in lieu of traditional fiat, so you get to skip the conversion step -- which is what I think would finally allow for genuine decentralized Bitcoin exchanges.

It could be reasonably argued that both the miners and Core devs are equally culpable for the current situation, since the Core devs made no changes after it became clear that SegWit by itself is/was insufficient.
As a result of their inaction, the miners have been forced to look elsewhere for a client version that provides them with the settings that they apparently wish to run instead of just SegWit by itself.

I had simply misinterpreted James' June 16 comments on his last BIP commit. I read too much into the "enforcement" aspect of what he was changing. Turns out he was only referring to the rejection of non-SegWit blocks when he described "activation," and not also the activation of the signal bit.

I hope you can appreciate that fact and consider a higher level of verification for customers who prove trustworthy over an extended period of time and spend tens of thousands of dollars (or more) at Coinbase.
At some point, perhaps a factor of time+money, customers should be able to earn a VIP status of some sort to eliminate all of the extra delays.

For starters, they don't consider bitcoins a currency... or do they?
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:53:52
I agree for the most part -- you are especially correct that only the existing financial institutions would be the authorized "full nodes" in the new centralized system.
However, the reason the blockchain would absolutely be more powerful than what they have now is because of those two words I kept using: Smart Contracts.
They could also eliminate clearing houses from their system, as even a centralized version would allow for direct bank-to-bank transactions (each tx confirmed by the central bank's authorized "miners," of course).
As for your last point regarding the unbanked and underbanked, they'd all still have access to Bitcoin, of course! :)
And then, through Bitcoin, they'd be able to trade for other digital currencies, as well... including, perhaps, FedCoin.
@_date: 2015-03-13 05:22:41

Therefore, the exact same statement is equally true for ~4MB blocks with SegWit2x.

"  as soon as existing $GBTC shareholders deposit shares in their brokerage accounts and elect to sell"  
"  to elaborate, shareholders that have held for 12 months are eligible to sell"  
"   live now, but we have no control as to when/if eligible shareholders deposit their shares and sell"
As I've said in the past, this entire GBTC event may be very underwhelming compared to the upcoming COIN IPO that will include 1,000,000 new shares on the market at the Winkdex price on day 1. 
The only way GBTC would get genuinely interesting (or exciting) is if BIT decides to issue more shares (IOW buy more baskets of coins), but I'm really not sure how/when/if that will even happen. 
That said, if the GBTC bids get ridiculously high, we'll likely see some current BIT holders take the bait for arbitrage purposes.

I don't even want to think about the ridiculously high fees that Western Union would try to charge customers for using Bitcoin... but, I'd be very ok with the USPS getting involved in a big way so that they can continue to survive off of their own revenue instead of taxpayer dollars.
People still trust the USPS, so it would be a near-perfect way to make Bitcoin easily accessible and acceptable to consumers everywhere in the U.S.
The only caveat, of course, is that it would make it easier for the government to track Bitcoin owners and accounts. Would it really be much different or worse than using Coinbase or Circle as banks, though?

Regarding  couldn't a machine sign a tx indicating receipt of a blue widget?
Example: Refrigerator orders a new bottle of ketchup. A RFID tag on the bottles of ketchup would indicate to the fridge that a new bottle of ketchup has been delivered and placed inside the fridge. The fridge then broadcasts the confirmed receipt of the ketchup using a signed tx, which in turn lets the smart contract know that it has been delivered. 
No third-party judgment required. ;)
Or, am I missing something?

In theory, a smart contract could be something as simple as a trigger that activates external actions -- such as releasing funds or ownership stored in another blockchain, database, or service -- when certain conditions are met (or not met) by X time.
In this case, the smart contract itself doesn't need to hold value; instead, it merely holds access keys to external items of value.
Example:  
Using a private blockchain, Alice and Bob create a smart contract that says: if it rains in Detroit on 25 March 2015, then Alice will pay Bob $10 USD using money from her Bank of America account. If it doesn't rain, Bob will pay Alice $10 USD in bitcoins from his Coinbase Bitcoin wallet.
Alice provides the smart contract with her BoA API access credentials, and Bob does the same with his Coinbase API access credentials.
Now, at exactly 00:00:01 on 26 March 2015, the contract will check the conditions at Weather.com. If it rained in Detroit the day before, the contract will use Alice's BoA credentials to initiate an ACH transfer to Bob. If it didn't, the smart contract will use Bob's Coinbase credentials to send $10 in BTC to Alice.
Please note that the smart contract didn't actually hold the value of anything in escrow. Instead, it simply held the access credentials to external accounts that themselves contain value.
Make sense? 
I just made this shit up, though, so perhaps I'm way off base... lol

The section about Willy is complete horseshit. Willy did not have any significant impact on price discovery during the rally. His buys were timed and calculated so as not to move the price by more than a penny or two. Often times, in the 5-10 minutes between his small buys of 10-19 coins, THOUSANDS of other coins changed hands on the popular Chinese exchanges and Gox.
China and real whales led every single day of the rally, not Willy.
Willy was a slow-motion accumulation bot that made no significant impact on price during the rally. Period.
Source: I discovered Willy, and even eventually helped select his name after studying him IN REAL TIME for two months. I briefed his existence to other traders in early January 2014, and even confronted Mark K. about him later that month. The conclusions in the reports written about Willy are incorrect, so it's sad to see major sites like this one spread the Willy FUD.

I am 100% sure that it's absolutely trivial to generate transactions for a block &gt; 1MB at a specific blockheight. 
Since setting a minimum blockheight for any tx is itself trivial, such a thing could even be done 3 months in advance by multiple parties once the hardfork's specific blockheight is known.

How much equity are you building with all of the rent money you're paying your landlord every month?  Answer: none.  
If you're only renting, how much interest do you get to deduct on your taxes every year?  Answer: none.  
While you might consider it a matter of pride to wait until you can pay for a house in full, you're actually not being very responsible with your family's finances by doing so.

@_date: 2017-07-13 18:33:59
Nonsense. Bitcoin is not designed to maintain the same consensus layer forever, and SegWit2x does nothing more than leverage the upgrade capabilities inherent to the system itself.
Every dev in this space knows that it's always been entirely possible for someone to fork and compete for control of the reference client and consensus layer. In fact, many have openly challenged everyone to try and do exactly that when differences of opinion became known.
That's what we're witnessing today with SegWit2x; and, as I said above, the process for doing this has always been inherent to the protocol itself.
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:36:55

SegWit2x is not "Jihancoin." He's just one of more than 60 business signatories to the NYA.
@_date: 2015-03-28 04:47:02
Does that figure take into account the number of shares issued at each price point, or is it simply the average of all the prices they've ever paid for coins?
Example: if 15,000 shares were issued at $15, and then 100 shares were issued at $20, the average base price is NOT (15+20)/2.  It's actually [(15000x15)+(100x20)]/16000. 
Make sense?
What specific figures and formulas did you use to come up with that figure?

I definitely agree that it's been well received, but they haven't presented it to the rest of the community as an actual rollout option in lieu of SegWit2x.
Instead, most seem to hope they can simply FUD SegWit2x to death between now and November. I don't think that's the best COA -- especially when they've got such a fantastic foundation for a hardfork in Spoonnet.
I'd much rather see them begin a fully coordinated and compatible hardfork plan with the BTC1 team. I even think the BTC1 team would gladly push back their own fork -- perhaps to six months, or more -- if it looked like Core was 100% serious about a coordinated HF release.

That is correct, but today's problem would have required everyone to be mining with default settings.
I wasn't home and haven't tested the beta version of the client myself, but I can't imagine *everyone* left their nodes set with defaults. (There were quite a few nodes during the alpha testing, so it would surprise me if there are fewer for beta).
If they did, and all of this was one big ridiculous screw-up that could have been avoided with proper conf settings, then I'll likely just give up on the entire SegWit2x effort and break out my popcorn for the remainder of the shitshow that's sure to follow...

One huge problem with SWIFT is that it's often used as a geopolitical sledgehammer.  Member nations use continued access to SWIFT as leverage in a wide range of geopolitical discussions -- they threaten removal from the system.

I feel that Jeff has been an excellent project manager thus far, especially given the scheduling pressures and politics threatening to consume the entire effort.
The two-part charter that governs his decisions is extremely limited in scope, so all of his decisions are currently decided by those limits.

I agree, and have been arguing in favor of a 2MB+SW hardfork for more than a year -- one that would act as a more effective stop-gap solution until we discover a more viable, perhaps more deterministic, long-term solution for on-chain scaling.

In that case, I agree. I actually hope they fork off with ABC instead -- even if their centralized chain somehow establishes some sort of actual value amongst those who don't give two shits about decentralization. I'd still be very glad to be rid of them.

It means that they can ignore SegWit transactions when they're structuring their own blocks if they wish to leave all SegWit fees on the table for others to take. 
They do still need to recognize SegWit blocks as valid, though.
Once SegWit transactions become the norm for everyone, I doubt any rational miner will leave all of the SegWit fees for others.
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:06:30
I'm not talking about beliefs. Bitcoin is now, and always had been, effectively *pseudononymous* -- not anonymous. You already know that, though. Obviously.
The clustering techniques used by most of the analytical tools leverage a very large number and variety of open sources to correlate addresses, activities, user identities, businesses, wallet types, significant events, etc. 
There are services whose sole function is to scrape data all day and every day across both the open and dark web, as well as countless forums and services that require logins to access their data, messages, etc.
The amount of information dumped into the databases for some of the blockchain tools is, as you can imagine, pretty astounding. 
I'll never forget the first demonstration I sat in where they searched for MY true name and came up with a fuckton of activity and addresses associated with my Bitcoin history -- primarily stemming from the fact that I've *never* used a fake name or alias on an exchange, but it was still rather impressive and enlightening.
None of this should surprise anyone who actually understands that Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous, nor is the blockchain designed to offer much in the way of privacy.
It will be cool as hell to see the effect of payment channels and confidential transactions on such tools, though, so please keep up the good work, Greg!

First, Willy was active for more than two months.
Second, Willy's small buys were spaced out long enough that often times *thousands* of other coins changed hands in the space between Willy 's small 10-19 coin buys.
Third, Willy was intentionally programmed NOT to move the market by more than a few pennies at any time. By mid to late December, other bots were actually trading against Willy and placing asks in the spread to be bought by Willy when he fired off. 
Finally, China and real whales drove that rally, every day, period.
At best, Willy may have had a small psychological effect on the market if/when he was even noticed, or after I told the trading world about him in early January.

@_date: 2017-07-16 00:06:52
Some asshole with an ASIC sped up the testing timetable several days by speed-mining thousands of blocks in a very short time. 
This caused the hardfork blockheight to trigger well ahead of schedule, thus catching the testers unaware. Once everyone figured out what was happening, a script was quickly whipped up to generate enough transactions to create a block larger than 1MB. As soon as that happened, all SegWit2x clients moved forward with the hardfork chain without further incident.
It most definitely was NOT a "bug," and the circumstances that caused the delay are impossible to recreate on mainnet -- where, without any problem at all, nLockTime transactions will be created three full months ahead of time that ensure a block larger than 1MB at the specified hardfork blockheight.
Calling it a "bug" is disingenuous nonsense and FUD. The SegWit2x beta client works perfectly fine in all respects -- up to, and including, the hardfork code.

He's talking about things like deciding on the final *User Agent Comment*, and such.
There has been a fairly long discussion about whether or not the user agent string should be changed to make the SegWit2x nodes easier to identify. The concern is that making them much easier to identify also makes them easier to attack.
IMO, their major version number already makes them fairly easy to identify, so changing the user agent won't change that fact very much.

That's absolutely true, but it still doesn't mean that people simply walk away from collecting on loans.
If I loan you money, I'm not simply going to forget about it because my OIL holdings happened to double that same year.
The only reasons I'd walk away are if my investigators determine you gave no chance in EVER hell of paying it back (through garnished wages, suing for your other assets, etc), or I determine that it would cost me more to pursue than I'm likely to ever collect through those other means.
Or, I could just sell your debt to another collector.
Again, though, nobody just walks away because another asset they're holding happened to do well.

You're correct, it did. However, that completely ignores the fact that ISPs have been actively trying to change that for the last several years; and, the only thing that has prevented them from destroying that neutrality is the FCC.
Perhaps you missed the fact that COMCAST was the second largest lobby in DC last year? (in terms of dollars spent).
In 2014, the cable industry spent over $18 Million lobbying against Net Neutrality in DC.


Do you even understand how the backbone works? You practically made my point for me by ignoring the fact that Google is ALREADY PAYING the backbone providers for the connection on their end -- which is all the more reason why they should not have to ALSO pay the end-user ISPs.
New start-ups could scale their own connection to said backbone accordingly if/when their popularity demands it. However, once they graduate to direct connections to said backbone, they should not ALSO have to pay end-user providers to deliver their services at a speed (from the backbone) that's equal to everyone else.
That's extortion.


Ahh, there it is... the anarchist agenda doesn't help your case at all. I forgot that the FCC is known for running around shooting and jailing telecom executives on a whim whenever they screw up fees and taxes. Thank you for reminding me! /s

Actually, yes, I do disagree. The blockchain concept, by itself, wasn't even new. What actually makes Bitcoin unique and profound is the distributed and near-trustless nature of the consensus.
For the first time in history, Satoshi created a permissionless distributed system that provides for near-trustless innovation and participation at the edges.
The features that made his effort unique and profound are the incentive structure and the proof-of-work system to achieve consensus -- which together establish the near-trustlessness.
In other words, without a token of value and corresponding PoW, the entire system is reduced to a glorified federated database that requires trust in a centralized entity to control (or dictate) access and consensus -- which is hardly interesting or unique.
tl;dr - The blockchain, by itself, is essentially pointless; and, it is certainly NOT what makes Bitcoin unique, profound, and powerful.

I'd love to see someone from Core REALLY step up, though. I don't think it's too late, and I know that Jeff Garzik would probably entertain pushing the SegWit2x hardfork back three months if it looked like Core was planning a fully coordinated and compatible hardfork with a specific flagday.

The hardfork will *automatically* occur on any nodes still running SegWit2x 12,960 blocks after SegWit's activation.
The only question is whether or not any miners will still be running SegWit2x at that time.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:54:59
Correct. The signaling on bit 1 and rejection of non-SegWit blocks won't activate until an additional 336 blocks after lock-in.

The BitcoinABC "Bitcoin Cash" clowns still plan to initiate their 8MB hardfork on August 1st, and they have previously claimed to have *explicit* mining support from Roger, Jihan, Craig, and John McAfee.
So, at a minimum, you should at least make sure you have enough popcorn for that shitshow...
As for Jihan, it would take a very long time to properly cover the drama he has inspired, and the threat his centralized mining cartel poses to Bitcoin, so I'll have to ask you to search for that using your own Google Fu. Sorry, but it's 2am here, and it rally would take a while.

The redemption program (an option for all existing BIT shareholders, not just AP's) is actually frozen pending an SEC inquiry, so GBTC is currently the only liquidation option for BIT holders.
Second, where did you see information regarding new AP's? BIT's last "interim filing" still lists SecondMarket as the only AP, so I'd be very interested in seeing who else has been given that capability.
Finally, GBTC is available to anyone with an account at a participating brokerage firm -- Fidelity, Ameritrade, etc -- so it's not limited to AP's, "top-level brokers," and accredited investors.

Have you ever seen Luke-jr call the original SegWit "SegWit4MB"? No, of course you haven't, and that tells us everything we need to know about this "8MB blocks" FUD that he began pushing a few weeks ago.
A full year of testing has shown us that the original BIP141 SegWit will result in blocks that are ~2MB *once nearly every transaction in a block is a SegWit transaction*.
With SegWit2x, the test results are simply doubled, such that the blocks will be ~4MB *once nearly every transaction in a block is a SegWit transaction*.
A popular layer 2 payment channel system may increase each of those results by 1MB, or so, but we *still* won't see many SegWit2x blocks approaching 4MB for quite some time, let alone *anything* approaching the full 4MB or 8MB of SegWit and SegWit2x, respectively.  
The complexity of the transactions necessary to generate that much witness data is just not going to happen *any time soon*.
Luke has admitted as much on Twitter, but it appears many of you still insist on spreading the "OMG! 8MB BLOCKZ!!1" nonsense anyways... sad that.

There is nothing magical about 1MB, in terms of fee pressure, that can't also be achieved with 2MB -- a limit that allows for increased adoption and/or a popular layer 2 application that increases the number, size, and complexity of on-chain transactions.
I simply feel that the 2MB limit is a much more effective stop-gap solution; which, in turn, provides us with the additional time we need to discover a more viable, *dynamic*, and permanent solution to on-chain scaling.

There are at least 25 companies working on similar blockchain analytical tools that I'm personally aware of. In fact, one of my jobs last year was testing a dozen of them and writing a report comparing each of them (I did this for one of the world's largest consulting firms).
The Bitcoin blockchain is public, and privacy/anonymity have never been inherent to the protocol. If you've ever thought otherwise, you don't actually understand how it works.
I suggest switching to something like Monero if you desire more anonymity and privacy, or practice exhaustive levels of OPSEC with your bitcoin.

Which is why their system will likely not involve PoW mining, and instead use some sort of PoS derivative.
That said, even Bitcoin itself could be only slightly altered to only allow for "authorized" miners.
In fact, there are already mechanisms in Bitcoin used to ignore potentially (or overtly) hostile nodes. Tweaking those to ONLY work with a specific set of miners would be simple. Blacklisting or whitelisting in the core would be trivial.

I believe there will be real interest and demand for GBTC, but not so much for BIT itself -- at least for a while.
At some point, though, the BIT shares will dry up on GBTC, so the demand dynamic may shift back to BIT and they'll have to buy new baskets of bitcoins to issue new shares.
I'm just not sure how long that will take, though.

Nobody is "in charge" of anything. It's *always* been possible for *anyone* to fork the code and attempt to convince large segments of the ecosystem to run said code. 
In fact, this exact scenario had been encouraged by nearly every Bitcoin dev since day one.


No, what they did is establish a specific compromise, coded said compromise in a new client, and then released said client to the world. 
Nobody is holding a gun to anyone's head and forcing them to run it, so Bitcoin appears to be working exactly as intended. Whether or not their efforts are ultimately successful is something that is still to be determined.

In a world without fiat, the answer to your question is EGGS. Ever-increasing demand for scarce BTC would increase the purchasing power of BTC for EGGS.
With linear deflation:  
Year 1: 1 satoshi buys 1 egg.  
Year 5: 1 satoshi buys 5 eggs.  
Year 10: 1 satoshi buys 10 eggs.  
Year 15: 1 satoshi buys 15 eggs.  
**Challenge:** In year 15, without adding an additional decimal place (aka a new sub-unit), how could you give me change for the purchase of just 1 egg?

His buys were very predictable in terms of amount and timing. 
In fact, that's how I first discovered him -- by manually staring at charts, the order book, and trades for hours on end.
Once you knew he was there, you could often identify his specific buys in the sea of others based on their predictable nature.  Many times, it would be tough to distinguish his buy if/when others made 10-19 BTC buys in the same time frame, but it became a game to spot his and say "there goes Willy...12.376865 at $903.13."
We placed bets based on how the ask side of the order book was forming. Example: current price is 903.11. We knew that Willy only bought 10-19 coins and waited an average of 7 minutes to do so. If the ask order book had just 2 BTC at 903.12, but 17 BTC at 903.13, we could predict that Willy's next buy would be at 903.13. The only guessing/betting part was mainly on the number of coins he would buy at that price -- which, btw, we never once got exactly correct. We almost always got the price correct, though, because Willy's purchase parameters were very predictable based on the ask side of the order book.
Retroactively reviewing hours of trades allowed me to extrapolate estimates for his daily and weekly volume long before we had any actual data.

The default miner settings do prevent the mining of any block over 1MB. That's certainly an issue worth discussing.
However, that's not what happened here, as most testers did have MaxBlockWeight set high enough in their .conf files to successfully mine the block.
The problem was a complete lack of tx in the mempool on the SegWit2x side of the fork. Once that was resolved with a flood of new tx, the 1.05MB block was successfully mined and all was right again.

That part isn't necessarily true. Contention, such as competing consensus layers, can also lead to protocol stagnation (or "remaining the same").

I don't think you understand what the word "Freudian" means... 
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:38:52


I do respectfully disagree here. I believe that a lack of an enforced hard limit in the consensus layer provides miners with too much power, as well as the ability for them to game the resource requirements to the detriment of all smaller competitors. IOW, it dramatically accelerates mining centralization, or at least creates the conditions in which that is possible.
My preference would be a dynamic limit implemented in such a way that it prevents the above possibility.


No, you're absolutely correct. Altcoins are another fantastic medium for testing alternative consensus layer mechanics. I should have mentioned those, as well.


The problem is that those who desire a completely different consensus layer have not, thus far, been satisfied with a minority hardfork. They have insisted, instead, on attempting to gain the majority and assume full/total control of Bitcoin itself.
The result of their stubborn efforts is the stagnation and stalemate we're witnessing today.
If they were actually willing to fork with a minority, and subsequently become an altcoin, then all of this drama could have been concluded a very long time ago.
This is why I agree with those who say that this more a fight for control than it is a fight for a few new or modified consensus rules.
SegWit2x presents a similar "threat" to the system, but I believe it more closely resembles the situation described by your final sentence:  


Even though SegWit2x resembles the compromise solution I've been seeking for 18 months now, I still have mixed feelings about the effort based on a few aspects of the project that aren't as transparent as I would like. I may even switch back to Core after SegWit activates because I REALLY don't like the condensed timeline for the SegWit2x hardfork...not really sure about that yet, though.
Anyways, I'm rambling at this point...good discussion, though.

One possible scenario:  
1) SegWit2x gets released.  
2) Jihan (and possibly others) do not run it right away.  They wait until after 1 August.  
3) The UASF/BIP148 fiasco kicks off on 1 August.  
4) Jihan uses said BIP148 fiasco as an excuse to initiate the big-block "UAHF" chain he threatened -- *instead of running SegWit2x!*  
5) All of the above splits fail miserably, and we're left with the non-SegWit 1MB status quo.  
6) Asicboost wins again!  
I think that may be the logic behind the current "stalling theory," and it's probably a very real possibility.

@_date: 2017-07-23 22:03:45


That's not what I suggested. My point was that they should push their own Spoonnet-based hardfork *in lieu of* SegWit2x, while at the same time coordinating with the BTC1 team to ensure consensus layer compatibility.
They could then compete on their merit, rather than competing with completely incompatible consensus layers.  


There is a very non-trivial portion of the mining, business, AND user community that disagrees with you. The fact that you refuse to acknowledge that *fact* makes civil and reasonable discussion almost impossible.
And yes, the vast majority of anti-SegWit2x sentiment expressed by many around here is pure FUD bullshit -- including all the "hardforks are too dangerous" nonsense in the face of a *guaranteed* split if Core continues to refuse a compromise.


Nonsense. Standard SegWit does *not* provide for ~15,000 tx per block.  Hell, SegWit2x won't even do that.

And yet, that is exactly what they *know* will happen anyway if they choose to do nothing at all.  


*They* may not have reason, but many of the largest businesses in this space and users in the community most certainly do.


80+ signatories to the NYA, and counting. In addition, there are *countless* moderate users, such as myself, who welcome the upcoming hardfork as the effective and acceptable compromise that it is. 
Luckily, thanks to the unbridled success of the first phase ofSegWit2x activation, many such users have made themselves known in the last week by posting their support for the compromise across all social media. 


Why are you bringing up the UASF? Weird...


There is no real data at all. Even Luke's Coinbase poll is/was rubbish. Quit acting like you've got science on your side for "community" sentiment -- you don't. Nobody does.  


I've seen ALL relevant SegWit test data, and have even done some testing of my own. At best, once SegWit transactions become the norm, and based on normal transaction behavior, we'll see ~2MB blocks with ~4k to 5k transactions each. You are totally and completely full of shot if you think 15,000 tx blocks would be a thing.


I cannot believe you just posted a link to that comment!! I don't know whether to laugh or cry at your ignorance in this situation...
Go back and read it again until you actually understand what was written in that response:  
**The answer you just linked to describes a hypothetical hardforked version of SegWit in which the *base size* is 4MB and the *MaxWeight* is 16MB! (with real size being ~7MB)**  
I mean, even the post itself says that the hypothetical hardfork example is *"4 times what the segwit soft fork would allow."*  
How the hell did you miss that?!
In other words, my math above is correct, and the BIP141 SegWit softfork will *actually* result in roughly 4,000 transactions per ~2MB block, and that's only once all/most tx are SegWit tx. 
It's pretty ridiculous that you genuinely believed it would be 15k per block, or anything even close to that.
I don't mean to be a dick, but it's really hard to take you seriously *on this particular subject* after that kind of mistake...

I personally believe that one of our biggest problems is that we have way too many markets, so the liquidity is spread way too thin across all of them.
If the dozen or so major markets pooled their liquidity -- combined their order books -- it would be MUCH harder for any single entity to move the market in either direction. 
It would still be possible for a little while, but it would take *a lot* more than a few thousand coins to make it happen on a daily basis.

No assumption is necessary.  
In the absence of sufficient transactions in the mempool, it is absolutely trivial to generate the transactions needed for a block larger than 1 MB on the main chain.  
In fact, since the specific hardfork blockheight is known three months ahead of time, such transactions can even be created three months ahead of time by multiple parties.
I'll probably even generate a number of transactions myself once we know the blockheight. I'll even use a vanity address or two just for shits and giggles. :)

This issue is not possible on mainnet if/when SegWit2x maintains a super-majority of the hashpower. 
Someone simply connected an ASIC to their testnet and took over 99+% of the hashpower, thus prematurely activating the hardfork and wipeout protection mechanisms in the SegWit2x clients.
While I personally feel that using a hardfork nVersion bit may be a better solution for wipeout protection, this particular situation on testnet5 wouldn't/couldn't actually happen on mainnet.

Only temporarily. Jihan has both the means and motive to build new ASICs that mine using the changed PoW, so it probably wouldn't be long before the newly modified PoW chain is under Jihan's control once again.
Centralized mining is the greatest threat facing Bitcoin, and I'm not sure what can be done about it when even changing the PoW algorithm is only a temporary fix.
We truly need some sort of hybrid PoW solution that can prevent the above from happening, but I haven't seen many such proposals outside of altcoins, and most of those haven't really been tested under extreme adversarial conditions.

What happens if Jihan dedicates 20+% of his hashpower -- which is roughly 4% of the total Bitcoin hashpower -- to conduct an empty block attack on the BIP148 chain that currently has much less than 4% of the Bitcoin hashpower?
Simultaneously, he could throw the remaining 45% of Bitcoin hashpower that he controls through his cartel at BitcoinABC, thus leaving the legacy chain and SegWit2x with only about 48% of the current hashpower.
Possible results:  
**BIP148 chain**:  Jihan has more than 51% and mines it into the dirt with empty blocks. Users switch back to Core.   
**BitcoinABC**: Takes 45% of current hashpower via Jihan's cartel + whatever mining power Craig and John McAfee have up their sleeve, if any. *They also have a hardcoded difficulty adjustment that helps them out immediately, because they planned for this.*  Unofficially becomes known as Jihancoin or Chinacoin, and subsequently crashes in the markets to almost zero. Many miners coming crawling back to legacy/SegWit2x chain weeks or months later.
**Legacy/SegWit2x**: Stuck with just 48% of current hashpower and no difficulty adjustment for ~4 weeks, but SegWit does activate successfully. Blocks take average of ~25 minutes each during first 4 weeks. Status of future SegWit2x hardfork unknown due to chaos.  Takes a big dump in the markets, but eventually survives.
Whatever happens, the month of August is going to be a show...

I need to game this a little more; but, my initial thoughts are that new SW tx will actually be pushed to the back of the line because of their lower fees, thus leaving the backlogged legacy tx to compete with new legacy-style tx -- just as they are now.
This, of course, assumes that miners would continue to include higher fee tx, rather than lower fee tx -- in order to maximize fee revenue.
Does that make sense?

They may even be able to leverage some new form of proof-of-stake since each and every major institution has a debt balance with the Fed (a USD "stake", or "proof-off-debt"?), and the likelihood of them attacking any central bank using a "nothing at stake attack," or any other exploit, is almost nil.

Blockchains CAN be centralized.
Think Bitcoin after a successful 51% attack wherein the the entity assuming control bans all other miners, but doesn't do anything else nefarious to user transactions.
The entire system would still work to confirm transactions and allow for programmable smart contracts -- something a normal centralized database can't easily accomplish. The ONLY functional differences would be that it's all controlled by a single central entity, and all users/nodes would have to trust said entity.
Here's the thing: financial institutions -- the users/nodes in this scenario -- already have to trust the central banks, so it's nothing new for them. They'd simply become the non-mining "full nodes" in the new centralized system, so they'd each have a copy of the full shared ledger (the blockchain).
Would you and I prefer such a system? Of course not. Our banks and brokerage firms would fill the role of full nodes, and we'd simply be the users with SPV clients. Our tx would be broadcast to those full nodes and the central miners, and the entire user experience would feel exactly like it does today with Bitcoin -- only without the warm and fuzzy trustlessness we all love. :(
The security of such a system would present a formidable challenge -- identifying and stopping rogue nodes and transactions -- but, it wouldn't be impossible to accomplish if both the hardware and software is designed correctly.

There are other Core devs contributing in various ways, as well. However, I wouldn't necessarily describe all of their efforts as "supportive" -- just some moreso than others.
Example: Luke submitted a legitimate Pull Request to the repo last week. His request is/was somewhat contentious, but not terribly so.
Edit: perhaps a better way to describe Core's involvement would be "there are some who are *participating*."  That does not imply as much good will as the word "supporting."

AFAIK, all Bitcoin transactions will be broadcast on both networks, as their replay protection is opt-in for all of their nodes.
In fact, SegWit transactions on Bitcoin will automatically appear as anyone-can-spend transactions on the BCC network, so their miners can spend those BCC to themselves. They're even using that fact as a selling point to attract miners!
I could be wrong, but the above seems to be the story they've been telling in rBTC.

I'm going to correct you ONE more time. After that, I'll consider you a bonafide troll if you continue to pay this falsehood.
As someone who has been involved in its development since day one, let me explain to you how SegWit2x *actually* works:  
1) During the initial 336 block signaling windows, SegWit2x clients *only signal on bit 4.*  
2)  Once 80% is reached during one of the signaling windows, the SegWit2x locks in both forks.  
3)  The SegWit2x client then waits an additional 336 blocks as a grace period before activating -- which then, *and only then*, begins signaling on bit 1 and rejecting non-SegWit blocks.
Now you know.
Edit:  The absolute soonest that SegWit2x clients will begin signaling on bit 1 (per the code) is Block

Wrong. 
Willy was a very slow accumulation bot that rarely moved the spread by more than a few pennies. While it could be said that his mere existence had some sort of micro-psychological impact on the overall market *after* I announced his existence to the world, he absolutely did NOT have much (if any) impact on the bubbling price.
The Chinese exchanges drove that entire bubble, as well as the subsequent crash. In the 5 to 10 minutes between every relatively tiny Willy purchase of 10-20 BTC, *thousands* of coins were traded on the Chinese exchanges that moved the global price dramatically. Every other exchange on the planet, including Gox, was chasing the Chinese rally.

Actually, no, I wasn't.
I was stating that Core has never presented *the community* with a coded/completed version of their client that contains a viable hardfork.
I'm very well aware of the random hardfork research being conducted by Johnson, Luke, and others -- to include Spoonnet and everything else on the mailing list and webpage.


Two different/separate thoughts captured there. Perhaps I should have made that more clear by making the second sentence a separate paragraph, but conflating the two statements is certainly not what I intended.


It's not FUD. 
My response to this was simply that I don't think it will be needed. That's where my thoughts on replay protection in SegWit2x began and ended. 
The FUD comment that followed was a prediction of what's to come between now and the hardfork. I expect the most outspoken Core devs to lose their collective fucking minds between now and then.

That's only true if they don't change a single default setting, which is something easily overcome by coordination ahead of time.
Said coordination is happening in real time already -- the entire deployment is being coordinated with all participating miners and businesses as we speak -- so it's not like the communication channels they're using now will somehow cease to exist after deployment.
And, since you haven't actually reviewed the code to provide specific examples of kludge or inept coding, I guess that's where this exchange ends.

SegWit2x was not borne from any effort initiated by Jihan. He is just one of 80+ signatories to the NYA, and counting.
What makes SegWit2x *his* effort, or ties the development of SegWit2x to *only him* in any way?

"Btc1" is the repo wherein the "SegWit2x client" has been developed.
Your understanding is incorrect.
The SegWit2x client does not begin bit1 signaling and the rejection of non-SegWit blocks until *after* the 336 block grace period that follows lock-in.
I've spelled this out for you three times now...  
1) SegWit2x locks in both forks when it reaches 80% during one of the initial 336 block signaling windows. During these initial signaling windows, **SegWit2x only signals on bit 4**.  
2) Following the lock-in, there is a 336 block "grace period" with no signaling.  
3) Following the grace period, BIP 91 activates signaling on bit 1 and begins rejecting non-SegWit blocks.  This is done until SegWit actually activates on the entire network (which occurs 3-5 weeks later, depending on the BIP9 2016 block signaling windows).
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:33:43

The biggest challenge, for me, has been identifying a system or standard for vetting (validating), and eventually listing, the charities using some sort of trustless arbitration system. I've been studying the BIPs to see if any of them offer relevant functionality.
Wouldn't it be awesome to have all verifiable charity transactions automatically get included in blocks without tx fees? (IOW, Bitcoins' own version of "tax exempt status") 
Wallets could be configured to always send a certain percentage with a charity "flag" to the charity of the user's choice, and those secondary tx could be processed for free based on their verified charity flag.
As you can see, verification is the big hurdle so that the charity flags can't be abused or gamed.
I'm hoping to present the ideas sometime this year... just not sure when/where... yet.

Upvoted for lunacy, because why not?
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:38:14
No. We only know that they *look like* they're running a BIP91 client. We have no way of knowing for sure without verifiable insider information from each mining operation.
It's extremely interesting that the entire Bitmain mining cartel has only been signaling on bit4, because all BIP91-capable clients normally default to both bit4 and bit1 at this stage. 
This means that they either a) manually turned off bit1 as some sort of political statement, which is what they claimed on Twitter, or b) none of them are actually running the SegWit2x BIP91 client they're supposed to be running per the New York Agreement.
It's certainly an intriguing situation given their previous outspoken support for the upcoming UAHF/Bitcash fork that's due to activate on August 1st...

Well, other than the fact that ABC is a guaranteed split, I sincerely hope you're correct.
That said, I suspect Jihan already has other plans, so SegWit2x won't likely reach 80% before July 26th -- which is what is required to prevent a messy BIP148 split on August 1st.

Because they don't need to know the source of my money, what I use my money for, or whom I give money to -- all of which should be considered private information that is none of their g'damn business if I don't choose to share it.

Unfortunately, that's exactly how the Bitcoin market cap has been "calculated" for the past several years.
Since we don't have accurate data on actual fiat for trades made OTC or off-market, the numbers you see on all the Bitcoin market sites are simply the number of coins in circulation times the current price.

Their explanation was that setting a hardfork bit would require all SPV clients to update their codebase to identify the new proper chain; whereas, with just a larger block at a specified height, most SPV nodes would still automatically follow the new chain.
There's also the issue of non-SegWit2x clients falsely signaling the new hardfork bit, thus confusing SPV clients trying to connect to the new chain.

1. Those three are certainly NOT making their immediate interest in such a fork known to anyone. They are NOT actually acting as champions for the idea.  
2. The NYA signatories, including myself, see SegWit2x as the only hardfork option right now. If there was another client option that provides the same 2M/8M blockspace + additional features, the NYA signatories would finally have an *actual* choice -- and many, including myself, would likely choose the Core version.  
As it stands, though, Core has not presented a viable hardfork option for the immediate future (3-6 months), so there is no choice to make -- SegWit2x is the only *viable* hardfork option. (Because, let's face it, BCC is fucking lame).
You have to understand that all of the participating miners and businesses have *already decided* that "no hardfork" is not a viable option. Given that position, there is only one viable hardfork option on the table -- so SegWit2x it is.

The non-witness data and segregated witness data are still sent out *together as one big block* by miners, so it's not really separated "from the block" until/unless another node operator wishes to do so later (as a form of pruning their own node storage).

Aha! So, we've finally arrived at the crux of the matter.
"Usually know" is (or should be) no longer applicable in a 21st century financial system built upon cryptocurrencies. 
How did the old system "usually know"? That's easy: institutions and individuals are/were forced by governments to play detective and invade *everyone's* privacy in *every* transaction.
To many of us, that is simply no longer acceptable, and crypto can (hopefully) provide new ways to eliminate those unjust invasions of privacy.

Netflix is built using the DASH (Dynamic Streaming over HTTP) protocol. HTTP itself is also an application protocol that has been "built on top of" TCP and UDP.
In the case of Bitcoin, specifically, you cannot separate it from bitcoin. The one cannot exist and function without the other (unlike TCP/IP). Together, they are one protocol.
Bitcoins (the currency) see sort of like the packets in TCP/IP. We just have the added ability to trade and own them. :)

The drugs and terrorism are the actual crimes.
The problem is that governments have made it so that concealing transactions somehow automatically indicates that those other crimes happened, rather than identifying those other crimes first and THEN following the money.

1) How are you measuring "the will of the users"? I believe the SW+2MB compromise idea has more support throughout the entire user community than you are willing to admit, and there'd be no issue at all if the exact same code changes had come from Core.  
2) I've got good news for you! Even once the SegWit2x HF activates, we will rarely see blocks over 3MB, let alone 4MB, during the first year or two after activation. (Similar to 1.5MB or 2MB with regular SegWit). Adoption of SegWit will likely take quite a while, so even 4MB blocks are highly unlikely in the near future. I doubt we'll lose more than a handful of full nodes, and the researchers at Cornell and elsewhere agree with me.
3) it took *years* to build up the frustration levels necessary to achieve any sort of consensus for this extremely minimal hardfork. If it's ultimately successful, then it is due to the hardfork process built into the protocol itself. How could that be deemed a failure or flaw? The longest valid chain is Bitcoin, right? If SegWit2x establishes itself as the new basis for tx and block validity across the entire ecosystem, then Bitcoin simply moves on with its new consensus layer. If not, then 1MB+SegWit is the consensus layer. Either way, there's progress made.
Core should have released a 2MB Spoonnet update a long time ago, and none of this nonsense would have even been necessary.
Whatever the case, I'm happy with either outcome, as SegWit alone also allows for further progress. Unlike you, though, I don't view the less-than-500-lines-of-new-code introduced by SegWit2x as the downfall of civilization and Armageddon. Every other item on Core's roadmap can still be introduced afterwards, and SegWit2x will provide everyone with additional time for R&amp;D to hopefully discover a more viable, long-term, and dynamic solution to on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:15:30
Hardly, though, in this case.
Studies have indicated that there would be no significant decrease in full nodes with 4MB blocks, and that is essentially the blocksize we'll have with SegWit2x.
BIP141 SegWit = We would reach ~2MB blocks in the next year or two.  
SegWit2x = We would reach ~4MB blocks in the next year or two.

It's not a lottery because it's done using direct donations AFTER the winner is chosen.
It's simply thousands of people *donating* (or "gifting") small amounts of money to one lucky person once a month.
Three neat facts: 1) there are no tax implications at all because the individual "gifts" are obviously well below the gift tax threshold, 2) they use the Bitcoin blockchain itself to randomly select a winner, and 3) cryptocurrencies are quickly becoming the preferred method for gifting!

He's not inflating the amount of btc available at all. That number remains fixed at just under 21 million, period. Never more, never less.
Additional zeroes added AFTER the decimal point simply increase the number of sub-units available on the market -- which, when added together, still *never* amount to more than 21 million whole bitcoins.
In other words, the amount of total purchasing power remains pegged to the total value of 21 million whole bitcoins, regardless of the number of sub-units.
You could add 100 zeroes after the decimal point, or 1000, and STILL never "inflate the amount of BTC available."

Uhh, I don't think you actually understand how multi-sig works.
Multi-sig wallets are useless for individual *user* wallets at off-chain exchanges like those we've seen "hacked" this week.
When you deposit coins into a real-time trading exchange, your coins are immediately and automatically transferred into the exchanges' hot wallet(s). (This is done by software, so your coins instantly become the property and responsibility of the exchange, not the user).
Then, at various times throughout each day, the exchange administrators move coins in and out of the hot wallet(s) -- to and from cold storage -- in order to have X percentage of coins available for user withdrawals 24/7.
The only truly viable options for multi-sig wallets in these infrastructures are the hot and cold wallets owned and managed by the exchange administrators -- not the users. 
And, since the processes of deposits and withdrawals are always online and automated, running multi-sig hot wallets still leaves all of them vulnerable to attack.
The cold storage solutions should absolutely include multi-sig addresses; however, those aren't the wallets we've seen "hacked" lately, so I assume many/most are fairly well designed -- and quite possibly already utilize multi-sig.
Tl;dr -- on off-chain exchanges, multi-sig is primarily suitable for cold storage, but those wallets aren't the wallets we've seen getting "hacked" lately.
Running around shouting "wtf use multi-sig!!!1" is pointless if you don't actually understand how it works, or how the exchanges infrastructures are designed...

First, SegWit2x hasn't even been released. Second, the choice will actually occur between now and the SegWit2x split, or soon thereafter.

The scheduled beta testing had begun on testnet5, but there was nothing in place to prevent a single ASIC from connecting and taking over the entire testnet5 with 99+% of the hashpower. 
That single ASIC managed to prematurely activate the hardfork phase of the testing -- something that's obviously not possible on mainnet.
On the mainnet, SegWit2x miners would properly prepare for the hardfork and mine a block larger than 1MB at the predetermined blockheight. This mechanism is meant for wipeout protection of the newly hardforked chain.
That said, I still think using a hardfork nVersion bit would be the smarter choice for wipeout protection at the specified blockheight.

It appears that you may not understand the pseudononymous nature of Bitcoin, or the general lack of privacy for anything that ever touches the Internet.
The analytical tools we're discussing were inevitable from the start, and governments all around the globe have actually been using many of them for quite some time now -- even down to the local law enforcement level throughout the United States (I can't speak for other locales in that regard).

I see little difference between what you're suggesting and what we're doing with SegWit2x. The 2x portion is not dramatically larger or beyond the current network limits, nor is SegWit2x itself a permanent/long-term solution to our on-scale needs.

In my experience when dealing with database engineers, normalization has also involved ensuring that the fields from multiple/varied sources are defined, such that "Time" in one source with a certain format equates to "Timeatamp" in other sources that are in different formats (as an example).  In many cases, the efforts involved programming the interpretation of the fields in each source so that they match and can therefore be used for analysis, visualization, etc. (Insert Tableau nightmares here)
So, it's news to me that normalization is *only* the elimination of redundancies, and not also the effort to make varied sources equitable, comparable, or in other ways able to be analyzed.
Put another way, normalization involved making differing structured data from multiple sources, and in multiple formats, relatable.
Are you telling me that the database wonks I've been working alongside with all these years are/were using the term incorrectly?

SegWit2x *is* the BTC1 implementation. I've been involved with the development there since day one.
Here's how it actually works:  
1) SegWit2x locks in both forks when it reaches 80% during one of the initial 336 block signaling windows. During these initial signaling windows, **SegWit2x only signals on bit 4**.  
2) Following the lock-in, there is a 336 block "grace period" with no signaling.  
3) Following the grace period, BIP 91 activates signaling on bit 1 and begins rejecting non-SegWit blocks.   


No, it's not part of any plan. Nice attempt at hyperbole.
Any change that's deemed necessary for the hardfork can and should still be coded, tested, and rolled out as an update prior to said hardfork.


Absolutely fucking false. That is not at all what happened on testnet5 last week.

Yes. They plan to launch their long-awaited "big block" hardfork on August 1st. 
Some of them have claimed that they have explicit mining support from Roger, Jihan, Craig, and even John McAfee. They also claimed that those four individuals are going to provide "an ungodly amount of hashpower" to ABC, while simultaneously removing a non-trivial amount of hashpower from the current Bitcoin blockchain.

Someone connected an ASIC miner to testnet5 and mined 6000+ blocks in one day, thus prematurely triggering the hardfork phase of the testing using their newfound majority hashpower.
SegWit2x nodes are currently just waiting for a single block to be mined that's larger than 1MB. As soon as that happens, they'll happily proceed with their new hardforked chain, just as they would on the mainnet at the scheduled blockheight of the hardfork IF a larger block is mined at that time.
In other words, the SegWit2x nodes are apparently working as intended, but...
That said, I personally believe that using a hardfork nVersion bit may be a much better mechanism for wipeout protection than relying on a specific blocksize at a specific blockheight. There are tradeoffs with either solution, though.
@_date: 2017-07-13 00:42:38

@_date: 2017-07-19 06:44:51


Incorrect. SegWit2x only signals on bit 4 until BIP91 activates. That activation occurs 336 blocks after lock-in. 
SegWit2x order of operations:  
336 block signaling window with only bit 4 -&gt; Lock-in for both forks -&gt; 336 block grace period -&gt; BIP91 activates bit 1 signaling and rejection of non-SegWit blocks.  
v20000010 is the correct (bit4) signaling during the initial signaling stage in SegWit2x.  
False flagging is an issue, but several of the miners have confirmed they're actually running SegWit2x on social media. That's the best we can really hope for, in terms of honest signaling.


Users can make the conscience choice to remain on a dying legacy chain after a fork occurs. That is certainly their prerogative.


Whatever changes are necessary can and will be tested veggie being pushed out -- consensus changes, or otherwise.
Something like replay protection, for example.

When and where did I say that? My TLDR very specifically states that they are most suitable for cold storage. 
And, prior to that, I did acknowledge that they *could* be used for hot wallets -- but I also explained why they'd still be vulnerable to attack because of the automated and online nature of the hot wallet software.
The only place that they are not at all viable is with individual *user* wallets on the exchanges, specifically.
Perhaps my OP just wasn't clear enough...?

For starters, the SPEED channel was owned by Fox and only "relaunched" as Fox Sports 1 in August 2013.
Second, the CWTS races on SPEED channel, prior to the name change, were still branded as "NASCAR on FOX" -- branding that has existed on **all** Fox NASCAR broadcasts for 13 seasons, and on **all** Fox channels.
Part of the problem is that the article mentioned the specific Sprint Cup ratings one time, then only used the more generic "NASCAR on FOX" for the rest of the stats... so I guess you could be correct, I don't know.

Didn't that single ASIC have nearly 99% of the hashpower during the "attack"? Did the difficulty ever reset properly after the ASIC turned off?
If there are not enough tx in the mempool to reach &gt; 1MB -- ie. no scripts generating thousands of them -- then wouldn't "nothing mined" be the expected behavior for SegWit2x nodes after HF activation at blockheight X?
I'm traveling at the moment, so I don't have access to any systems I could point at their testnet. Info would be much appreciated.

The 2MB hardfork is only paired with BIP91 in the BTC1/SegWit2x client, specifically.

With no additional improvements to block structuring, VISA-level throughput would actually require standard blocks to range from 666MB to 8GB in size, depending on the day.
That said, it's really difficult to predict this chicken and egg situation. At what point do big businesses *actually* become more incentivised to run their own full nodes? What number of users would encourage them to do so when we haven't seen any of them do so thus far? What happens if we accidentally centralize the system too soon? Could we recover? Is doing so just a necessary step in the progress toward mass adoption? How quickly do we scale? What determines the pace?
If we play devil's advocate and begin to tackle these types of questions, it quickly becomes obvious that it's all guess-work, and none of us have any ability to predict the future. The single question then becomes: *do we take the chance, or not?*  
Thus far, the answer had been a pretty resounding *NO!* from the majority of the dev community.

Actually, with the exception of easily identifiable double spends, the system is both fast and programmable enough to prevent it altogether.
The protocol logically prevents you from using transaction inputs you don't actually own.
The reason traditional banks have overdrafts is because their system is not fast enough to prevent such withdrawals from happening, so they had to build in a mechanism to address it after the fact.

Probably no longer than 30 minutes, but closer to the "normal" 10 minutes given the trivial nature of intentionally creating such a block on the main chain.

Yeah, Spoonnet uses a linear increase solution, which I also prefer over all available options. The exact limits were not written in stone with the proposal, so they could be set to any reasonable values. Below is a summary of the proposal taken from [the initial mailing list submission:](    


1. A fixed starting time. Not dependent on miner signalling. However, it requires at least 51% of miners to actually build the new block format in order to get activated.  
2. It has no mechanism to prevent a split. If 49% of miners insist on the original chain, they could keep going. Split prevention is a social problem, not a technical one.  
3. It is compatible with existing Stratum mining protocol. Only pool software upgrade is needed  
4. A new extended and flexible header is located at the witness field of the coinbase transaction  
5. It is backward compatible with existing light wallets  
6. Dedicated space for miners to put anything they want, which bitcoin users could completely ignore. Merge-mining friendly.  
7. Small header space for miners to include non-consensus enforced bitcoin related data, useful for fee estimation etc.  
8. A new transaction weight formula to encourage responsible use of UTXO  
**9. A linear growth of actual block size until certain limit**   
10. Sighash O(n^2) protection for legacy (non-segwit) outputs  
11. Optional anti-transaction replay  
12. A new optional coinbase tx format that allows additional inputs, including spending of immature previous coinbase outputs

Saying that SegWit2x is a product of anything related to only Jihan's interests, specifically, is just plain ridiculous.
Jihan is just 1 of 80+ signatories to the NYA, and counting. His role in the development of SegWit2x is no more or less than any of the many signatories of the charter, and Barry certainly DID NOT organize the NYA at the behest of the Jihan cartel.
Stop trying to mislabel SegWit2x as some sort of Jihan plot or conspiracy. He had little or nothing to do with its success beyond installing and running it in his mining operations.

That's a really tough question given my lack of a functional crystal ball, so I'll just say the following:  
I hope that what you describe exists for as long as possible; however, I do believe that a) most daily transactions will *likely* move to a layer above the main protocol in order to maintain their "cheap and fast" qualities, and b) wallets will probably offer both payment channels AND direct access to the Bitcoin blockchain, and it will be up to each user to decide which to use for each *type* of tx.
It's also my hope that the higher layer applications will maintain most or all of the decentralized security properties of the main chain, but that expectation may be unrealistic -- especially in the immediate/near future.
If there are a few profound breakthroughs in p2p networking, compression, and physics itself, the main chain could possibly scale to the point that all transactions could be directly on the chain, but I'm not sure many of us will be alive to see those types of breakthroughs occur.
I suspect that the more distant future will involve apps that execute atomic swaps across countless blockchains, and that such swaps will be invisible to end users who just hit "Send Payment" and walk away. However, we may be a good number of years away from that.
Your question is a really tough one...so many possibilities. Sorry I can't really nail down a better answer!

The Bitcash difficulty is only lowered in 20% increments whenever it takes more than 12 hours to mine 6 blocks.
Even with those included difficulty adjustments, it will certainly still be a mess for several days.

Why? To prevent SegWit activation and cause turmoil.
Someone like Jihan could leverage the resulting chaos as an excuse to fork his entire mining cartel over to BitcoinABC on August 1st. He's said to directly or indirectly control nearly 50% of all hashpower...but who knows...
Possible? Certainly.  
Likely? Well, Peter Todd said tonight that he gives it a 25% chance that this may happen... However, I'm personally giving it a slightly higher chance than that based on the fact that Jihan is such a shady bastard.

@_date: 2017-07-11 04:10:25
How can they do so without tx in the mempool?
They elected not to hardcode a "pre-made transaction" for that purpose because it could be completely broken by spending the inputs elsewhere.
Most testnets rely on scripts to generate X number of tx of a certain type, size, etc. In this case, they simply weren't prepared for the hardfork to occur days ahead of schedule, so nobody had sufficient tx scripts running today.

If we can successfully get nearly every major mining operation in the world to run SegWit2x in just one week -- which it looks like we have -- then I'm damn sure we can push out any necessary tweaks in an update, or even more than one update, between now and November.
The hardfork code in SegWit2x is already pretty damn solid, so anything we tweak or add will be relatively simple to test and push out in that timeframe.

That is certainly an option, but it's another one that can easily be falsely signaled by miners on an opposing chain.
The one big selling factor for the large block solution they settled on is that it cannot be mimicked by miners on the legacy chain.  The &gt; 1MB block distinctly identifies the new chain and very effectively prevents a wipeout.

He flipped out, called me crazy, and adamantly denied any such bot existed.

There were very few lulls in the market during the entire rally. Even so, Willy's buys were not enough to prevent the sag during those infrequent lulls. 
I can only think of one 90 minute period when Willy was the only buyer, and that was when the Gox servers went down for everyone else and Willy remained active for that 90 minutes. In fact, that was the evidence we used to ultimately prove his existence, and it's also the evidence I used when I confronted Mark (with screenshots).

I'm not sure I agree given the fact that such attacks could also be funded the same amount by any persons or governments that simply want to damage the network.

It's incredible to see this "age-old" Bitcoin debate show up in a blog post on NASDAQ in 2015... I mean, shit, we've really come a long way!
That said, I wholeheartedly agree that we need to establish an international naming convention (or standard) that lay-persons can easily grasp and use every day.  While various services have tried to push various naming schemes, there really isn't a perfect solution to this problem yet, and there's certainly no universal standard for any of the above.
Are we all just ignoring this dilemma and hoping it works itself out, or are there any genuine efforts to establish a naming convention once and for all? I really haven't seen anything addressing this issue lately...

It's already "locked in."
This post is discussing what might happen if the majority of miners choose to ignore that lock and simply not activate the next stage of BIP91, which is the enforcement stage (the rejection of non-SegWit blocks).
There wouldn't be another lock-in stage if this one is simply ignored.
**The BIP91 stages**:  
1) 336 block signaling window.  
2) lock-in.  
3) 336 block grace period.  
4) enforcement -- the rejection of non-SegWit blocks until BIP9/BIP141 locks in and activates SegWit on regular Core nodes.
We're just now finishing up stage 2. We currently have about 2.3 days until stage 4 is supposed to kick in.

I think everyone recognizes or understands that blocks will eventually need to be dynamic in nature, but we've seen nothing except BIP100 that even comes close to providing a viable dynamic implementation -- and I personally believe we can do a lot better than BIP100.
The mission, should anyone choose to accept it:   
- solution must be dynamic in nature.  
- solution must NOT grant excessive power to any one component of the ecosystem.   
- solution must not dramatically accelerate the trend toward centralization.  
- solution must NOT nullify or diminish the role of non-mining full nodes.  
- the dynamic scaling must be throttled in such a way that the resource requirements for full nodes must NOT be "excessive," or decidedly beyond the means of most users (herein lies the most tricky requirement and metric).   
Ok.... GO! ;)

That's where you're wrong. Core would announce that the hardfork had their support, they'd provide a flag day, and only THEN would it be "up to the community" to run their hardfork software, or not.
In the absence of the actual code, though, "the community" can't decide shit.


Because nobody is ever going to rally behind *anything* that doesn't have some sense of leadership and/or champions. It's up to Core, or even just Lau himself, to step up and promote Spoonnet as a viable alternative *now* -- not a year or two from now after the rest of the community has made other plans.


Simply because I honestly don't believe we'll need it. The FUD campaign against 2x will continue to be quite ruthless, but I don't think it will sway the miners and economic players at all before November.

Willy purchased between 10 and 19 BTC every 5-10 minutes. Those small buys *never* moved the price by more than a few pennies. 
Willy's purchase amounts and timing were very obviously written to take the spread and order book into account; as a result, Willy would wait a maximum of ten minutes for the order book to present an ask (or group of asks) that wouldn't move the price up by more than a few cents when Willy made a purchase.
By late December, several competing bots were created to place asks (sells) directly in front of Willy to prevent almost all measurable movement.
Willy was a very slow and low impact accumulation bot. Often times, *thousands of coins* would change hands in the 5-10 minutes between Willy's small buys.

Please see Hilliard's final segsignal-related adjustments (commits) to SegWit2x. The changes I've described were made after we all wrestled with this exact signaling question for nearly a week.  
**Order of operations (paraphrasing code)**:  
Step 1:  Signal on bit4 during concurrent 336 block signaling windows.  
Step 2:  lock-in the activation of both forks once support on bit 4 reaches 80% during one of the signaling windows.  
Step 3: Initiate 336 block grace period.  
Step 4: Activate BIP91 to turn on bit 1 signaling and rejection of non-SegWit blocks.  
Step 5: Wait for network-wide SegWit activation (via BIP9's 95% threshold and subsequent 2016 block grace period).  
Step 6: Activate 2MB hardfork 12,960 blocks after SegWit activation.

However, as with every other issue, I absolutely despise the government getting involved in every market and in every aspect of our lives.
In the absence of a working global meshnet, what other ways are there to codify and ensure completely neutral access to internet content?
The ISP oligopolies are certainly not going to ensure or support neutrality themselves because their markets are not free markets where competition might pressure them to do just that.
So, now what? Is the only other option a tiered Internet with fast lanes until such a time that meshnets become functional and practical?

No, you really can't. As a neutral transfer medium, the bitcoin used for the transaction have to represent the value of the fiat being transferred; and, more importantly, the miners would stop mining altogether if said bitcoins didn't maintain a value.
That's how Bitcoin works.
What you're describing is something like Ripple or Stellar wherein the "coins" are merely a rail, but each of those requires "trusted" and "authorized" gateways that do nothing more than exchange IOU's with each other -- exactly like our current banking system. They do not require mining and there is no actual decentralization. They're basically the same old ACH network with a cryptographic ledger capturing every transaction -- nothing more profound than that.
The decentralized Bitcoin network requires the tokens (bitcoins) to maintain a known value in order to transfer value while simultaneously maintaining rewards for every mining node participating in the network.  
No bitcoin value = no rewards = no mining = no security = no Bitcoin network.

It's already locked in. Any miner who elects to run something else that doesn't support SegWit, at this point, will soon see all of their mined blocks rejected by the super majority of miners still running a BIP91 client.
That said, if a super majority suddenly switches to a non-SegWit client, all bets are off, and some chaos would ensue. The result of that might look something like the planned UASF, I guess, but it could also be much worse.

It does obligate them to run SegWit2x, though, and Antpool is already signaling their intent to do so.

The "stall" was **not** the result of any bug in the code. You obviously don't understand how/why the issue occurred.  Please go back and read Charlie Shrem's summary of the event.


That issue was actually pointed out to the SegWit2x devs almost a full week prior to Greg mentioning it.  In fact, Greg merely confirmed the suspicions of the individual who brought it to their attention. 
I know this for a fact, as both the repo and mailing list contain said notifications that support this fact.  There are other reasons I know this for a fact, as well...


There is no misconception amongst the SegWit2x devs that the hardfork is somehow guaranteed because of the initial lock-in. Everyone knows and readily admits that every last node has the option to switch back to a different client software before the hardfork activates.
That said, I also understand that most/all NYA signatories have continued to affirm their commitments to the agreement. Thus far, there is no indication beyond speculation that any of them intend to withdraw after SegWit activates.

Each of those I've spoken to have assured me, personally, that Jihan played no significant role in the calls, either.
I really haven't seen or heard anything that would lead me to believe Jihan has any extra influence on Jeff's decisions beyond his one and only public request for wipeout protection two months ago.
The FUD will be FUD, though, so I doubt anyone is listening to little old me defending the team/effort... such is life. I'm still confident in my own decision to support the effort.
I just wish Core would coordinate and create a compatible Spoonnet release of their own...

It's actually a well understood form of wipeout protection -- creating at least one block with the new rules that would be considered invalid according to the old rules -- so, I think you may be giving Jihan a little too much credit in this case.

They were forced to hardfork ASAP in order to initiate the fork before SegWit activates. Their entire motive is to scale without SegWit (and RBF).


Agreed. Unfortunately, they're not really going anywhere. Their plan is to stay in the Bitcoin community and disrupt it as much as possible while they constantly promote their fork as "the Satoshi chain."

Once again, SegWit2x does not orphan SegWit blocks or signal on bit 1 until *after* the 336 block grace period *that follows* the initial lock-in.
Only then is BIP91 considered "activated."
1) order of operations:  
*Signaling window* -&gt; Lock-in -&gt; *Grace Period* -&gt; BIP91 activation of Bit1 signaling and orphaning of non-SegWit blocks.   
2) The *signaling window* and *grace period* are each 336 blocks long.

In the case of self-owned, but otherwise "dumb" cars, it would depend entirely on their programming. 
If the programming is designed for for "maximize profit at all times," then one could argue that a natural equilibrium would be reached wherein the simple laws of supply, demand, and competition would dictate the fees charged by the cars for any of their services. It could also help adjust their maintenance schedules and types of maintenance performed.
Human laws could be drafted to require things like "must display rates in very large fonts on the sides of the vehicle," or "must present digital signed certificate of maintenance to all customers at time of pick up." (The certificate could/would be verified by a blockchain, of course! ;)
Such requirements would allow consumers themselves the ability to "teach" the cars which rates and levels of maintenance are ideal to maximize profits.
Apps used to find and hire such cars could also allow for feedback like "car was too dirty," or even "strange noise coming from engine."
The cars would analyze the feedback, as well as their revenue, and adjust all of their variables accordingly.
Alternative: cars initially paid for by the public could have all excess revenue funneled back into public coffers for additional public services -- such as road maintenance, education programs, military funding, police salaries, etc. These revenue streams could effectively replace taxes! :)

Any hashpower that leaves to mine on another chain *has no impact at all* on signaling, as the support percentages represent the percent of blocks mined during a specified period, not the percentage of hashpower at the beginning of the period.
In other words, the signaling percentage could/would remain at ~100% of blocks, regardless of how much hashpower switches to mine BCH.
The only possible impact it may have is a slightly higher average block time for Bitcoin.

Yes. The blockheight of the hardfork is entirely dependent on the blockheight of the actual SegWit activation.
However, that said, the "lock-in" after the initial signaling period(s) of 336 blocks guarantees *both* the SegWit activation and hardfork activation on any/all nodes still running the SegWit2x client at their respective specific blockheights.
The activation of SegWit in SegWit2x nodes 336 blocks after lock-in ALSO leverages BIP91 to a) turns on bit 1 signaling to aid Core's BIP9 activation of SegWit, which itself requires 95% support, and b) rejects any/all non-SegWit ready blocks until SegWit is actually activated by BIP9 as well.
That last step essentially does the same thing as BIP148 and almost guarantees the BIP9 activation of Core's SegWit rollout, as well.
Make sense?

Offensive? No. Are you really a snowflake?

It's my prediction that replay protection in SegWit2x is unnecessary because the legacy 1MB chain will only survive as an altcoin after a PoW/difficulty change.
SegWit2x will become the new Bitcoin reference client... unless Core merges the hardfork code, or codes their own compatible version. In that case, Core and BTC1 could compete for users in the future based on feature enhancements and confidence in the dev teams.

Just out of curiosity, what qualifies it as a "monstrosity"? There are fewer than 500 new or modified lines of code. Do you have any specific examples of poor or low quality code changes in SegWit2x?
The only thing I have a problem with is the accelerated schedule for the hardfork. I really wish they'd reconsider and push it back 3 more months (12,960 additional blocks). It would also be cool to get some of the hardfork wishlist items in there, but I do understand why they're limiting the scope and keeping it simple instead.
That said, other than that, I've reviewed every new LOC, and it all seems fairly clean and straightforward. For that reason, I don't really understand the "monstrosity" label.

I've come to the very obvious conclusion that the public blockchain is *meant* to be analyzed using any/every tool imaginable -- up to, and including, tools that link all blockchain activity to specific identities.
Full privacy and anonymity have never been inherent to Bitcoin, so analytical tools, such as those being developed by at least 25 companies that I'm aware of, are/were to be expected.
Let me repeat this for emphasis: the Bitcoin blockchain is public, thus privacy and true anonymity have never been inherent to Bitcoin.

BIT shares essentially *become* "GBTC" once they're transferred by shareholders to a brokerage firm to sell on the open market. The GBTC itself can then be freely bought and sold on the market at will, but it can't be easily converted back to original BIT shares to be held at Greyscale. (In fact, I'm really not sure how that will work considering you have to be an accredited investor to hold original BIT shares at Greyscale).
It's a little bit different than stock in a company because actual BIT shares held with Greyscale, directly, have different investor requirements, benefits, and restrictions than the GBTC sold out in the open markets that anyone can buy, sell, and hold.

As someone who has been involved with SegWit2x development from day one, I can assure everyone reading this that the delay was absolutely NOT the result of any bug in the software. Period.
I don't know why you insist on pressing the issue when you clearly don't actually understand what happened, and why, but I refuse to allow your incorrect claim to go unchallenged.
Every SegWit2x client in testnet5 behaved exactly as it should given the circumstances of the ASIC bumping up the timetable.
There was absolutely no bug in the code in any aspect of this incident/issue. The circumstances of the delay cannot occur on mainnet, and the SegWit2x hardfork code is perfectly fine, as is.

LN and other payment channel solutions have absolutely nothing to do with Core developing the reference client. 
Payment channels are not built *into* the client -- they exist on an entirely separate layer, or "above," the Bitcoin network layer.
The payment channel functionality will be included in wallet apps that simply interface with the Bitcoin network (in the background) to open and close channels.
I think you have a very fundamental misunderstanding of how payment channels work, so this theory of yours doesn't really make much sense -- especially since SegWit2x would still provide SegWit...obviously.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:18:25
Absolutely wrong. As someone who has been involved in its development since day one, let me explain to you how SegWit2x *actually* works.
1) During the initial 336 block signaling windows, SegWit2x clients *only signal on bit 4.*  
2)  Once 80% is reached during one of the signaling windows, the SegWit2x locks in both forks.  
3)  The SegWit2x client then waits an additional 336 blocks as a grace period before activating -- which then, *and only then*, begins signaling on bit 1 and rejecting non-SegWit blocks.
Now you know.
Edit:  The absolute soonest that SegWit2x clients can/will begin signaling on bit 1 is Block

IF we ever get to the point where the value of 1 satoshi rises too high to buy just 1 candy bar at a time, we have the unique ability to add another decimal place to further divide satoshis into a new sub-unit.  
1. Adding the additional sub-unit does NOT raise OR lower the price of the candy bars,  
2. Adding the additional sub-unit does NOT increase OR decrease the purchasing power (value) of anyone's bitcoin holdings, and  
3. I'm getting really f'n tired of trying to explain this extremely basic concept to you...

Once again, I'm against laws that diminish privacy and liberties for *everyone* simply to try and catch a few criminals hiding in the global haystack.
The "Know Your Customer" laws and regulations imposed on financial institutions are a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
They are also the only reason that any financial institution needs to be concerned about "money laundering."  Without such draconian laws and regulations, the entire financial system could operate without having to play detective and invade everyone's privacy -- but, that would also mean that law enforcement and intelligence organizations would have to get off their collective asses and go outside to catch *real* criminals instead using old fashioned police work and legal warrants.

They recently merged a change to the policy text to reflect an open policy wherein anyone can open an Issue on the repo without automatic closure.
The mining algorithm is working just fine. Miners simply need to modify their conf file before he hardfork to change a single setting. (MaxBlockWeight = 8000000).
@_date: 2017-07-11 02:14:28
I'm just waiting for word on exactly how they generated the tx to get it unstuck. It's possible that someone had to modify the client to do it, but I personally don't think so. I can't say that definitively, though, because it wasn't me.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:07:42


Yeah, that has been bothering me for some time. The code for the hardfork activation is based entirely on the activation of SegWit *by any means*, and there's no effective way to measure *actual* support for the hardfork in the three months preceding the fork.

I've personally never tried their vault services. However, if it works as advertised, then the coins should be be fine (and recoverable by you) in their Vault.
That said, using their Vault service still requires a little but of trust, and there are also delays if/when you wish to move (or sell) some if the coins from there.
I much prefer my hardware and paper wallets; but, of course, that's completely your call. 
My limits are much higher there, so perhaps you could verify to a higher level to buy the entire $20k amount at once? I've done $50k before, but I'm really not sure how they're handling/raising the limits these days.
Good luck!
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:43:47
You don't understand. Off-chain exchanges that offer real-time trading *can't* use multi-sig addresses for their users. When you deposit coins in such exchanges, they're immediately transferred to that exchange's hot wallet(s) that are owned and controlled by the exchange administrators, *not* the users.
You can't trade in real time on an off-chain exchange from a multi-sig address. This capability doesn't exist, and it probably won't exist for quite some time.

Regular SegWit increases the block size limit **4 times**, and SegWit2x obviously doubles that.


With standard blocks? Sure. However, it's certainly not as easy or cheap to create the extremely complex transactions necessary for 6MB of witness data. 
Such "spam" wouldn't last very long at all, and it wouldn't accomplish very much either -- primarily because it would be absolutely obvious to the whole planet if/when totally absurd *20 of 20 multisig transactions* are flooding the mempool.

How much of that 2MB is derived from coinbase transactions on the other side of the split (or descend from them)?
(As you can see, I'm watching the conversation unfold on their repo, as well.  LOL )
The correct test, at this point, would be to generate 5k tx using coins born prior to the HF blockheight. 
If the SegWit2x clients remain stuck after doing so, then you're correct, and something is very broken. If not, though, then the code is working as intended.

Because Core themselves aren't presenting it as a viable Core release *right now*. If they announced such a thing tomorrow, I can almost guarantee that most businesses would choose their version of the hardfork instead of the BCT1 version, and they'd subsequently retain control of Bitcoin development for the entire foreseeable future.
Random posts and discussions on the mailing list don't qualify as "viable Core releases," or promotion of the same. Spoonnet needs strong Core champions to make it happen, but nobody in Core appears to have any interest in doing so at this time -- even in the face of a guaranteed split in November.
The full coordination of such a release with the BTC1 team, perhaps in six months instead of three, would be fucking epic.

I believe the SegWit2x nodes that had mining turned on may have been using default settings, which would mean they were unable to mine any blocks larger than 1MB at the time of the HF.
I think Jeff (or someone else) simply restarted their node(s) with the proper custom setting for *MaxBlockWeight*, and the required transaction was subsequently mined right away.

You can't be this naive. These tools are so far ahead of the users and devs in this regard that it's borderline absurd to object to their existence at this point.
Some of the tools I tested last year rendered every tumbler in existence (at the time) completely useless, and there's nothing inherent to the Bitcoin protocol than can protect users from said tools.
The only hope anyone can have is that our awesome devs continue to work on dramatically enhancing privacy, and that they make it THE number one priority after all this scaling bullshit is settled for a while.
As of a year ago, when I last tested several of the available tools, this entire network was completely pwned by the agencies and institutions monitoring and analyzing the nodes, users, and chain.
Blacklists? Keep watching the regulators. That shit is a done deal if dramatic changes aren't made to enhance privacy and security in Bitcoin.

I would alter his statement to include "most secured" as the deciding factor.
As it stands, with the current algorithm, Bitcoin is still by far the most secured crypto currency -- measured, in general terms, as a factor of hashpower and decentralization. Although, it must be recognized that *decentralization* itself is difficult (albeit not impossible) to quantify.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:25:06
The fork was intentional. Some jackass with an ASIC simply sped up the timetable by taking 99% of the testnet5 hashpower and speed-mining thousands of blocks. That caused the fork to occur several days ahead of the testing schedule.

I fully support an *additional* 2MB hardfork for bitcoin, [and I've done so since before the Hong Kong Agreement 18+ months ago.](  
The Core devs have it within their power to prevent a chain split three months from now, but doing so will require an actual civil discussion, a compromise, and the coordination of a responsible hardfork involving all parties -- including the BTC1 team.

Just out of curiosity, how do 80+% of miners and ~50% of the major economic nodes (businesses) qualify *together* as a "special interest"?
Aren't those the exact segments of the ecosystem that all other upgrade efforts have been courting or attempting to win over for the last year or two? 
What would "community driven" look like to you if SegWit2x doesn't qualify as such?
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:58:12
SegWit2x is currently in beta testing and fully functional. The official release is scheduled for the latter half of July.
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:56:08


Again, that's only if they fail to set a single specific setting in their .conf file.
 As long as they add "MaxBlockWeight = 8000000" to that conf file sometime between the SegWit activation and the hardfork, they can create the larger than 1MB HF block just fine. Educating them on the fact that this setting is necessary is already happening as we speak.


Awesome. You must know that it makes your opinions on code fairly uninformed and useless, right?  


It's absolutely trivial to ensure they have the tx necessary to create the required block at the specific blockheight, so this criticism is once again nonsensical.


Bothering with what? Wipeout protection itself?
Because it would be negligent NOT to provide such protection.

The Core devs didn't provide ANY actual/realistic 2MB hardfork proposals until almost a year later when Johnson Lau submitted the Spoonnet proposal to the mailing list -- which has (sadly) been mostly ignored since January.
The only thing that even came close was Luke's completely absurd proposal to initially reduce blocks to 300kb, and then only grow them at a pace that reaches the current 1MB several years later before continuing on to 2MB.
The few individuals who signed the HKA didn't code or champion any other straightforward 2MB hardfork proposals last summer, or since.

SegWit increases the max blocksize to 4MB, so SW blocks will vary in size between 0 and 4MB, depending on the size and type of transactions within each block.


SegWit doesn't do that.  


Data storage? What extraneous data are you trying to store in the blockchain, and why? SegWit doesn't change anything in that regard, but I really don't understand what you're trying to accomplish with "data storage"


It was never meant to be the long-term solution. SegWit is meant to act as a stop-gap solution until a **viable** long-term solution is discovered. There are no known **viable** long-term solutions at this time.


Again with the data storage. What are you talking about? What data?


You actually have no idea what SegWit actually is, or how it actually works, so you are "definitely" either a) paid to say that, or b) a victim of some sort of weird brainwashing experiment.

With Bitcoin, it's not possible to overdraft.  Your wallet won't show you to spend inputs you don't own.

That only works if/when those companies control the encryption keys (instead of users).
The phone companies can't decrypt anything we encrypt on our end and then send through their networks to cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive. Those services can't decrypt our files either. They don't have the keys.
Do you even understand how encryption works?

I've said nothing of the sort. My point is that they've never presented a legitimate  *coded* SW+2MB client as an option that the community could run to express their (our) support. Not once. Ever.
Is there a secret Spoonnet version of Core 0.15 in the works that I'm not aware of? No? That's my point. 
They need to do exactly that before they can ever claim that they've actually given the community a genuine choice.


You obviously have no idea why SegWit2x has been successful where so many others, including Core, have failed to gain consensus?
The answer is leadership and direction, as well as fantastic timing and effective communication with major economic players in the ecosystem. 


Did you know that every BIP requires a "champion" to actively promote it to other devs and the community? That rule is established in BIP001.
There's a reason for that, and it's the exact same reason I said above that leadership and direction are not only expected for success, they're required.


I said no such thing. 
Don't ever fucking put words in my mouth again, or this conversation is finished. 


I simply believe that SegWit2x will be successful. If you find that belief offensive, I can't help you, as I'm not one to mince words on Reddit just to protect someone's feels.

Aren't the mining and other major economic nodes the EXACT segments of the ecosystem that every upgrade effort, including Core, has been courting for the last two years to gain their support?

I'm not exactly sure what you're claiming is a "load of shit." 
The only reason you can't do so on such a large scale is because those payments you described are held and manually confirmed by whoever it is you give them to -- not because the banking system tells them that you don't have the money in ten minutes or less.
Again, though, I'm not exactly sure what you're saying.
Everything I wrote above is true. Overdraft exists because the legacy system isn't able to efficiently and effectively prevent spending more than you own in any particular account.

The scheduled beta testing had begun on testnet5, but there was nothing in place to prevent a single ASIC from connecting and taking over the entire testnet5 with 99+% of the hashpower. 
That single ASIC managed to prematurely activate the hardfork phase of the testing -- something that's obviously not possible on mainnet.
On the mainnet, SegWit2x miners would properly prepare for the hardfork and mine a block larger than 1MB at the predetermined blockheight. This mechanism is meant for wipeout protection of the newly hardforked chain.
That said, I still think using a hardfork nVersion bit would be the smarter choice for wipeout protection at the specified blockheight.

There are approximately 200 bitcoins available on Bitfinex for $246 right now.
Look up the words "market slippage."
A single market buy for 8000 bitcoins would instantly clear the order book at bfx to almost $270, and the price would then immediately drop back down to $245 after the purchase because the bid-side of the order book wouldn't move up quickly enough to support the new price.
That's an instantaneous loss of ~$25 per coin, or $200,000 total loss.
Why? Because the current markets can't handle such large orders without severe *slippage* caused by a lack of *liquidity*. (IOW: not enough coins being traded...yet)
These are just some of the very basic concepts that you need to learn and understand in order to answer your own questions about why Wall Street isn't involved yet.
The above is the reason that large investors (Tim Draper, hedge funds, etc) currently prefer to buy their large blocks of coins in the auctions or off-market. Until those two options dry up, or one of the new regulated exchanges gets more liquidity, you won't see Wall Street money directly affect the price.
It will almost certainly happen at some point, but it will likely be a while before we see it.

Fair enough. But, I still hope people simply keep their expectations for GBTC in check.
That said, if the GBTC shares do start trading significantly higher than bitcoin spot price, I expect two things to happen:  
1) more current BIT holders will be encouraged to sell (because arbitrage), and  
2) the spot price may move up to gain parity, or at least come close to gaining parity, with the GBTC price.  
Regardless, the entire situation may be interesting to watch.

@_date: 2017-07-13 19:18:23
Pasted from my other reply to you:  
We likely won't see blocks approaching 4MB for a year or more with SegWit2x, and I doubt we'll *ever* see anything approaching 6MB, let alone 8MB.
Such a thing would require a full 6MB of witness data, which is obviously absurd given anything resembling normal transaction behavior.
You should ignore the hyperbolic bullshit Luke is spreading about "8MB blocks." (Have you ever seen him call the original BIP141 "SegWit 4MB"? No, you haven't, because it's nonsense. So is "SegWit8MB").
He knows damn well that the nature of Bitcoin transactions would need to completely change to even break ~4.2MB -- which is exactly the same situation with standard SegWit rarely reaching ~2.1MB blocks.

I believe he was just saying that the nodes won't invent a block &gt; 1MB out of thin air if/when the mempool is completely empty for an extended period of time -- a situation that is very unlikely on mainnet.
That said, I do believe there are some issues related to the DEFAULT mining settings that may need to be resolved before release. The current defaults prevent the SegWit2x miners from mining block larger than 1MB, so any miner who doesn't manually change them would be unable to mine the HF block itself.

Two things...  
1) You may want to ask why one of the pools that signed the HKA was running/signaling for Classic just one week after said agreement, and   
2) there were five *individuals* associated with Core who later reneged on their *individual* commitments to the HKA, and they have/had no authority to make commitments on behalf of the hundreds of developers who comprise the Core collective/project -- which is why Greg Maxwell called Adam a "dipshit" soon afterwards. The lead maintainer for Core wasn't even one of those individuals, so you can't use that angle either.

I very specifically focused on the concept of a *champion*, or a group of champions, which is a slightly different concept than "a leader."
Yes, champions do provide some form of leadership, but only for an *idea*, not people.
In the case of UASF/BIP148, both shaolinfry and Luke definitely qualify as champions for that idea/movement. They were on Reddit and Twitter creating threads and posting their adamant support *nearly every day* for three months. That is what it means to be a champion for an idea, rather than a leader of people. 
There's a very good reason that BIP001 states that every new BIP absolutely requires a *champion* who is defined as:  
"someone who writes the BIP using the style and format described below, **shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea**."  
So, as I said, please wake me up when a strong Spoonnet *champion* steps forward and actually makes an adamant effort to build community support for a Spoonnet hardfork in the immediate/near future.
Until that happens, SegWit2x remains the only viable hardfork option.

I know that. But, there's really no reason to do that if all you want at the end of the day is GBTC. You can simply buy GBTC using a brokerage account and be done.


That's exactly why people are interested. Being able to peg a percentage of your 401k or IRA to Bitcoin's success without dealing with tax and early withdrawal penalties is a very beautiful thing.  
That said, it would be foolish to go in with 100%.

Jesus H Christ... 
The "btc1 implementation" and "SegWit2x" are the same goddamn thing.


False. There is only one client in the btc1 repo, which I call "SegWit2x," and it DOES NOT signal on bit 1 until AFTER the grace period that follows lock-in.
There is no btc1/SegWit2x client that is coded to signal bit1 BEFORE the end of the grace period (unless the miner manually sets the bit themselves).
Any miner that already signals bit1 has either a) manually set the bit1 signal themselves, or b) run something other than btc1/SegWit2x.

My biggest issue with Coinbase is the lengthy automatic delay they have when you buy less than the daily limit (but higher than the instant buy).
I've been a Level 2 verified customer there for 14 months, and I've bought many coins using their instant buy service. This is the first time I've used their daily buy process -- for larger amounts -- and it sucks. :(
They have had my money transfer in *their* account since Thursday, but they're not depositing my new coins into my wallet until Monday. 
Total time for the transaction = 9 days, including 4 days AFTER they received my money transfer.
Wtf? Why?
I also won't be surprised if they cancel the order on Monday once they realize the price has gone up since I placed my order. They've allegedly been doing that a lot lately...

The miners are smart enough to understand that centralization and decentralization are not easily quantifiable, and that average end-users and traders can't tell the difference between a Bitcoin network with 100 nodes and a network with 100,000 nodes.
End-users and traders only care about two things:  
1. continued adoption (rising price), and  
2. functionality (easy, fast, and cheap). 
For that reason, the miners are entirely willing to centralize to a degree that no self-respecting crypto geek would tolerate. Neither the markets or average Joe will care, though. 
Only nerds like us will notice and care, but our voices will be drowned out by the ever-increasing adoption and soaring price.

That's an absurd statement or assumption given the number of skilled developers currently participating on the repo and elsewhere -- especially given the simplicity of the hardfork code itself.

As said, the hardfork blockheight is based on the SegWit activation block. I'll paraphrase the code for you:  
*SegWit2x hardfork block = SegWit activation block + 12,960 blocks*  
That total is actually (90x144), which is ~90 days, or ~3 months.
I think the very best case scenario puts the hardfork activation somewhere around November 18th.
@_date: 2017-07-08 15:42:16


@_date: 2017-07-16 02:30:19


That is absolutely correct, and it's also absolutely justified. Once the hardfork activates, none of Core's current seed nodes would point new SegWit2x nodes to the proper SegWit2x p2p network. 
This PR remedies that issue by adding seed nodes that will point to SegWit2x nodes, specifically.
This is how a hardfork works boys and girls. Welcome to Bitcoin.

Unlike murder, money laundering is an invented crime -- a construct invented by laws and regulations. It only exists as a crime because governments require institutions and systems to invade everyone's privacy to find out the origin and ultimate destination of any money transfer.
If such invasive requirements didn't exist, money laundering wouldn't even be a thing, much less a crime, because the "knowingly" aspect of it would no longer exist.

The SegWit softfork than will likely occur right away (during August) is an entirely passive event for users.
However, SegWit2x will initiate a 2MB hardfork exactly 90 days after SegWit activates, and that hardfork will definitely cause a chain split. Support for each of the two sides in that split is still to be determined.

For the last time, individual *user* multi-sig is currently useless for off-chain real-time exchanges.
Until we have some sort of decentralized way to trade on the blockchain in real time, multi-sig won't do a damn thing to protect *active traders*; so, please stop acting as though "the magic of multi-sig" could or would prevent these exchange hacks from losing user coins.
Here's a better idea: if you're an active bitcoin trader, use more reputable exchanges and stop gambling/leaving huge piles of coins on shitcoin exchanges.

We've come full circle:  


It's only a crime if you (or an institution) *knowingly* do it -- you've said as much a dozen times now. 
The entire point is that you, as a transfer agent or agnostic system facilitating a transfer, shouldn't be required to "know" anything about the origin or ultimate destination of the money.
Crypto can, and hopefully will, result in a financial system that ignores the identity of both senders and recipients, and the origin of any funds transferred using said system.
We deserve a system that doesn't compromise *everyone's* privacy for the sake of identifying a few criminals here and there.

It's a hardfork proposal posted to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list by Johnson Lau back in February, and it really looks fantastic.

Multi-sig wallets are useless for individual *user* wallets at off-chain exchanges like those we've seen hacked this week.
When you deposit coins into a real-time trading exchange, your coins are immediately and automatically transferred into the exchanges' hot wallet(s). (They instantly become the property and responsibility of the exchange, not the user).
Then, at various times throughout each day, the exchange administrators move coins in and out of the hot wallet(s) -- to and from cold storage -- in order to have X percentage of coins available for user withdrawals 24/7.
The only truly viable options for multi-sig wallets in these infrastructures are the hot and cold wallets owned and managed by the exchange administrators -- not the users. 
And, since the processes of deposits and withdrawals are always online and automated, running multi-sig hot wallets still leaves all of them vulnerable to attack.
The cold storage solutions should absolutely include multi-sig addresses; however, those aren't the wallets we've seen "hacked" lately, so I assume many/most are fairly well designed -- and quite possibly already utilize multi-sig.
Tl;dr -- on off-chain exchanges, multi-sig is only really viable for cold storage wallets, but those aren't the wallets we've seen getting "hacked" lately.

There are completely legitimate reasons to conceal the origin of funds in financial transactions -- aka "money laundering."
The number one reason? Privacy.
In other words, the concealment of a transaction shouldn't automatically lead to the assumption of another crime -- yet that is the idea that is being put forth by governments.
The money laundering itself isn't the crime -- the drugs are.

The activation of the hardfork itself is dependent on the activation of SegWit. I'll paraphrase the code for ya:

Sounds like the user's email address was compromised first.  Using that email, the attackers somehow socially engineered a 2FA change without the exchanges catching on. 
A simple *"I lost my phone with GoogleAuth..."* email to their tech support may have been enough to initiate the change, which would be really terrible security on the part of the exchange vif that's actually the case.
I would expect them to make users jump through hoops of fire to prove their real identities, but it sounds like maybe they don't/didn't do that in these cases.

There will always be plenty of profit taking along the way. Most *traders* are in it for fiat, not necessarily holding big piles of bitcoin forever. In fact, many (most?) only worry about their last trade and how much more fiat they have from that entry/exit, not how much it may have gone up since that exit. Instead, they're simply studying and planning their next entry.
Simplified example: if I enter at $200 and buy 100 btc ($20k), and it rises to $300, I'll probably sell and take that $10k in profit and plan for my next entry with a new base investment of $30k -- rinse and repeat, even if the new entry price is higher than $300.

The SegWit2x code only signals on bit4 until it reaches 80% during one of its 336 block signaling windows.
Once that occurs, the code waits an additional 336 blocks as a "grace period," and only THEN activates signaling on bit1 and the rejection of non-SegWit blocks.
In other words, their signaling is exactly as it should be right now with the actual SegWit2x client.

I believe both BitPay and Coinbase offer merchants the ability to include a Bitcoin-specific discount on every transaction.  They handle everything so that merchants don't need to worry about the logistics of the sale.

It blows my mind that you still don't get it.
By definition, deflation means that the purchasing power (value) of the currency increases. There would be no good reason for the price of goods and services to consistently follow the currency up, because that would mean that the currency itself is not actually deflationary.
The currency being deflationary means that 1 satoshi today may buy just 1 candy bar; however, once the purchasing power (value) of the currency increases, that same 1 satoshi may buy 10 candy bars tomorrow.  
When that happens, another decimal place can be added *simply to be able to buy less than 10 candy bars again* instead of being forced to always buy 10.
The value of the candy bars doesn't change -- it's static. Only the purchasing power (value) of the currency changes.
**Challenge:** if the value of 1 satoshi increases to the point that I can now buy 10 candy bars with it, instead of 1, how would you sell me just 1 candy bar without adding another decimal place for pricing? How would you give me change for the purchase of just 1 candy bar if no smaller sub-unit exists?
In other words, I buy 1 candy bar and you now owe me 9/10 of a satoshi in change... how do you give me that change?

Skip to 34:59 for his thoughts on "digital cash," specifically.
Edit: he goes on to say, during the QA, two very interesting things:  
1. That "Bitcoin has already done 90% of the work" in preparing the world for the concept of digital cash, and  
2. "Bitcoin is hilarious" because of the intentional ten minute confirmation time.  
While he's certainly overly dismissive of Bitcoin being the ultimate solution, he doesn't disagree with the premise in any way.
I personally believe that we'll successfully overcome any/all limitations imposed by the confirmation times and block sizes, but we ALL definitely need our focus to remain on overcoming each of those limitations in the very near future.

The Interim filling is exactly where I obtained the information I was referring to above.
Please re-read Page 63 of the interim report that covers the period ending December 2014.
Except:  


It goes on to describe the limitations on initial liquidity I was referring to above:  


**As of 31 December 2014, all 1,382,400 existing issued/outstanding shares were already held by 184  investors.**
Those already owned shares account for BIT's total bitcoin holdings (138,240 BTC).
As I said, those shareholders are meant to be the supply for the initial sales of GBTC. If no current holder sells, *then and only then* will BIT consider issuing a new basket (100 new shares) to be sold at market price -- which would require them to simultaneously buy 10 BTC on the open markets to add to their bitcoin reserves.
As you can see, the GBTC fund will work in a completely different way than COIN will since GBTC is based on a private Trust that already exists.
COIN, on the other hand, will act like a true IPO with 1,000,000 shares available to traders on day one.
Just as I tried to tell you before...
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:40:53
The arb opportunity is this: current BIT holders can sell GBTC at $50 (equivalent to $500/btc), then take that money and buy real bitcoin on other bitcoin markets for ~$250/btc.

I know exactly what money laundering is. I also know that, other than the methods you listed, plenty of very large banking institutions are indeed very guilty of laundering money every day -- that is, they *knowingly* transfer money that was obtained through various other criminal activities. (See: HSBC, drug cartels, blah blah etc).
That said, if they weren't required to know or care who their customers were, then their involvement wouldn't even be a crime.
And, I couldn't care less if you send money to ISIS. I'll happily support the killing of the ISIS recipients, though. And, if I find out through intelligence and other good old fashioned police work that you support them with money, I'll see that you're arrested for supporting terrorism and prosecuted accordingly.
What I won't do? I won't require your bank or other financial institutions in the middle to do that police work for me by invading *everybody else's* privacy during *every other* transaction that is completely unrelated to crime and terrorism.

Willy didn't become a trading indicator until January 2014 when I first briefed his existence to a group of traders during a Google Hangout live broadcast. I then explained his existence to the users at Tradingview.com and many of us began to joke about Willy being a bullish indicator.
Willy himself never moved the price -- his buys were too small and too spaced out over time to raise the prices -- however, as I said, it is certainly possible that many traders began to use his on and offline status as an indicator in mid to late January 2014. 
Again, though, this all became known two months after the actual rally, so his status didn't affect anything during the November rise itself.

It's very simple to understand: the actual virus infection occurs through another attack vector (ie. phishing or watering hole attacks), and then said virus waits on the infected machine for text instructions included in the OP_RETURN field of every transaction.
While the above is certainly possible, the blockchain itself is not the original vector of attack, and the blockchain only acts as a delivery mechanism for commands; so, it's fairly irresponsible (not to mention inaccurate) to present it that way.

Because waiting 20 minutes to confirm the purchase of a cup of coffee is impractical.
We must find a decentralized solution that either a) makes zero conf much more secure, and/or b) reduces "trustable" confirmation to seconds.
If replace-by-fee becomes the norm on the main blockchain, then something like sidechains or multi-sig notaries needs to happen sooner, rather than later.
Either way, we *need* something that will reduce confirmations to seconds without nuking security. How we actually get there any time soon is anyone's guess...

We likely won't see blocks approaching 4MB for a year or more with SegWit2x, and I doubt we'll *ever* see anything approaching 6MB, let alone 8MB.
Such a thing would require a full 6MB of witness data, which is obviously absurd given anything resembling normal transaction behavior.
You should ignore the hyperbolic bullshit Luke is spreading about "8MB blocks." (Have you ever seen him call the original BIP141 "SegWit4MB"? No, of course you haven't, because it's nonsense. So is "SegWit8MB").
He knows damn well that the nature of Bitcoin transactions would need to completely change to even break ~4.2MB -- which is exactly the same situation with standard SegWit rarely reaching ~2.1MB blocks.

Go review them if you wish.
As for the new DNS seeds, they're necessary for effective peer discovery in the new p2p network after the SegWit2x hardfork.
I assume you've never had a problem with 4 of the 6 existing DNS seeds run by current or former Blockstream employees, so you should probably chill with the FUD about the new SegWit2x seeds.

Someone connected an ASIC miner to testnet5 and mined 6000+ blocks in one day, thus prematurely triggering the hardfork phase of the testing using their newfound majority hashpower.
SegWit2x nodes are currently just waiting for a single block to be mined that's larger than 1MB. As soon as that happens, they'll happily proceed with their new hardforked chain, just as they would on the mainnet at the scheduled blockheight of the hardfork IF a larger block is mined at that time.
In other words, the SegWit2x nodes are apparently working as intended, but...
**That said, I believe that using a hardfork nVersion bit would be a MUCH better mechanism for wipeout protection than relying on a specific blocksize at a specific blockheight.** I'm really not sure wtf they are/were thinking...
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:33:40
Are you sure it was manually mined?
Or, did they simply dump a bunch of fresh tx into their mempool?  
(something we shouldn't need to worry about on mainnet... unless the entire world completely stops transacting bitcoin for 29 hours during the fork?)

@_date: 2017-07-12 20:13:02


It's not something that should be, or needs to be, hardcoded into the client itself. Hardcoding a prepared block is completely unnecessary, not to mention an incredibly terrible idea.


The same way every tx is broadcast. The SegWit2x devs are already preparing the necessary DNS seeds for proper peer discovery after the deployment. (On another note, did you know that the current p2p network relies heavily on six DNS seed systems, with each of them run separately by a different Core dev? Not many users realize that exists...)
You can also send tx straight to a cooperating miner if you really want to, but doing so is entirely unnecessary in this case.  


If that's your plan, you're much better off waiting and doing so immediately after the fork. Make sure you study up on how to manage/move your coins simultaneously on both chains, though, as there a few steps you could do ahead of time.
I actually plan to do the same, of course.
Good luck!

It provides for an *effective* increase since it allows for more tx per block, not an actual increase to the block size cap.

TPS has nothing to do with confirming available balances in a timely manner to prevent overdrafts -- which is what banks can't do to prevent them.

You can visit the repo just like anyone else. If you can't read the code, then I can't help you beyond what I've already explained.
In other news, there was a new PR submitted yesterday (by James Hilliard) to modify the BIP91 (signaling) thresholds in SegWit2x. The signaling period has been reduced to a 672-block period, such that 538 blocks are now the threshold for 80% lock-in. This may now be enough to demonstrate "success" of SegWit2x prior to 1 August...hopefully/maybe/we'll see...
Since most of the responses to the change have been ACK or Concept ACK, I suspect the change will end up being merged in time for Alpha release (scheduled for tomorrow).
If you understood everything I just wrote, then head on over to the repo and review everything yourself. If you have any questions after reviewing the code, or you just can't understand the code, let me know and I'll try to help you out.

Therein lies the rub. For whatever reason, the miners simply didn't like it, or were not satisfied with what the Core devs provided.
SegWit2x is essentially an expression of what they would actually "like" and agree to run. Had the Core devs given them an *actual 2MB choice with working code* a year ago, this whole mess would have been mostly avoided.  
I'm sure the kids in rBTC would still have thrown their "no limits" tantrum, but the miners themselves would have gladly run a Core version of the settings found in SegWit2x.
In fact, if Core were to take the time NOW to create a SegWit2x-compatible version, I can almost guarantee that most miners would elect to run the Core version instead of SegWit2x.
Instead, the Core devs continue to ignore the actual desires/requirements of those who mine the Bitcoin blockchain, and miners are forced to look elsewhere for their client needs.
So, for better or worse, here we are...

Who has every made that claim? You're just making shit up at this point.
The testers simply weren't prepared for an ASIC connecting to testnet5, thus causing the hardfork to activate many days ahead of schedule. The stall was easily resolved once it was discovered, and all nodes performed exactly as they should before, during, and after the stall.


Absolutely not. The hardfork is hardcoded to be fully dependant on the actual activation of SegWit.

The entire point of this argument is/was that SegWit2x isn't supposed to be signaling on bit 1 yet -- and it won't do so until BIP91 is activated AFTER the required grace period that follows lock-in.
You claimed otherwise, and that the SegWit2x clients weren't properly signaling bit1 when they were supposed to -- which is entirely incorrect.
**The SegWit2x clients will all begin signaling on bit 1 and rejecting non-SegWit blocks (using BIP91) exactly 337 blocks after locking in the forks with 80%. Until that time, and as long as the bit 1 isn't activated manually, they will only signal on bit 4. Period.** 
The SegWit2x code is working as intended.

The basis for GBTC is actually the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), which is the trust where the actual underlying asset (bitcoin) is held. 
The BIT requires all members to hold their BIT shares for 12 months before they can transfer their BIT ownership certificates to the exchanges for conversion into GBTC shares that trade on the open market -- which obviously prevents any workable arbitrage opportunities from GBTC -&gt; BIT -&gt; BTC, and vice versa. This has the secondary effect of preventing any significant *price* correlation between GBTC and BTC. (The two markets tend to move in a similar fashion, but the GBTC price does not reflect an actual multiple of BTC).
The COIN ETF, on the other hand, *should* allow share holders to exchange their shares directly for the underlying asset (bitcoin). This may lead to both arbitrage opportunities and a direct correlation between BTC and COIN prices. In other words, since every COIN share represents 1/5 of a bitcoin, the BTC price may always move to 5x that of COIN (due to arbitrage).
That said, since most asset transfers for other commodity ETF's often take days/weeks to convert shares to assets, and vice versa, the arbitrage with COIN/BTC may ultimately be too slow to keep the two markets in sync. It will be very interesting to see how it all works out.
Bottom line:  COIN is much more like other "traditional" commodity-based ETFs (ie. precious medals, oil barrels, etc).  The current GBTC/BIT ETF is set up to work differently, so the two ETFs should have different effects on the overall BTC market.
Edit:  Since it will trade on NASDAQ, COIN will also be much more easily added as part of IRAs and 401k accounts, so many people believe that fact alone will dramatically increase the interest (demand) in the COIN ETF.

It's just not getting any traction, though.

Which part of "BIP91 doesn't activate with added bit1 signaling until after the grace period" confuses you?
James' statement is still accurate because SegWit2x doesn't fucking activate the BIP91 with added bit 1 signaling, and rejection of non-SegWit blocks, until AFTER the 336 block grace period that follows lock-in.
The initial signaling window that only signals on bit4 **IS NOT BIP91**.  The signaling window, lock-in, and grace period are driven by code **THAT IS UNIQUE TO SEGWIT2X.**
On SegWit2x, the BIP91 code itself **does not activate until the end of the grace period**.
This is seriously my last attempt to explain this to you...

Unless Jihan and his friends intentionally wait until after August 1st to install SegWit2x, thus intentionally forcing the UASF mess to occur. They could then leverage the subsequent chaos as an excuse to not run SegWit2x, and begin mining large blocks with BitcoinABC or BU instead. 
I'm not sure I believe their threats of a big block mutiny, but it's still one possibility.
Regardless, several of the kids in rBTC do still plan to attempt a hardfork using BitcoinABC. Some of them claim to have *explicit* mining support from Roger, Jihan, Craig, and John McAfee, but I personally don't know how accurate any of their claims are.
My gut tells me that they're going to fall flat on their face with little or no mining support, and absolutely no exchange support at all, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they go for it anyways.

I'm not buying your snowball-effect theory.
As with all things Bitcoin, one should trust the code, not the coders.
There are plenty of people reviewing the code, including myself, who will raise very bright red flags if anything is ever added that negatively impacts pseudonymity, fungibility, or security.
The 3 to 4MB blocks we'll have with SegWit2x won't have much impact on the ability for most people to run their own nodes. 
The only reason we may see any initial drop is if some people simply refuse to run anything that isn't Core. It may be up to those people to simply put pressure on Core devs to eventually merge the hardfork code. Otherwise, I have little doubt that the node count will eventually return to where it is now, or potentially even increase as a result of increased adoption.

I think you're being a bit melodramatic. From a future engineering perspective, the end result of this hardfork would not be much different than BIP141+1MB blocks.

@_date: 2017-06-14 22:41:31
Yes, but how will Jihan measure the "success" of SegWit2x on 1 August if the first signaling period hasn't even ended by that time?
And, ironically, SegWit2x requires all of Bitmain's hashpower to have any chance at all of reaching the 80% signaling threshold that is required for SegWit lock-in. 
If Bitmain stops signaling for SegWit2x on 1 August in order to put their other 8MB hardfork plans in motion, or to attack the BIP148 chain, SegWit2x will not be able to reach the required 80% during that signaling period (which ends on or around 4 August).
I honestly don't believe Jihan ever intended to help SegWit2x succeed. He knows these dates, so he also knows it's impossible for SegWit2x to lock-in prior to 1 August. It makes has verbal support for SegWit2x appear disingenuous.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:25:27

The additional 4-day hold is a real killer when the market moves against you. :(

As of Thursday, the transfer was settled as complete and no longer reversible -- confirmed by my own bank's representative using the Federal Reserve transaction ID assigned to every EFT.
It's a fairly substantial amount of money, so I worked with my bank to track it every step of the way. I am also assessing the Coinbase process to determine whether I want to use them for large purchases again in the future.
There's absolutely no excuse for the extended delay. I will likely use other OTC's for future large buys.

On one hand, this is obviously fantastic, as it gives more people around the globe access to Bitcoin.
On the other hand, it spreads out the liquidity, thus making it much more difficult to move the market with large purchases.
ie. Rather than purchasing 5k bitcoin on one exchange, thus raising the price significantly with that single purchase, you can spread the purchase out over 20 different exchanges and hardly move the price at all.
IMO, It will be some time before volume and demand overcome this particular issue.
And, sadly, regulations may also lead to large purchases being conducted on only a handful of "more legitimate" exchanges... but hey, I guess that's a good thing for price, right?

You cannot separate the *Bitcoin* blockchain from bitcoin. Period.
Anything that currently uses a different blockchain should be considered a separate and distinct transport protocol.
Bitcoin itself, once properly evolved, is the transport protocol upon which all other applications and application protocols can be built.
Many of the existing application and alt-coin developers currently using their own blockchains have openly stated that they'll likely convert their projects to Bitcoin sidechains if/when that option becomes available.
As a result, they would become the application protocols built on top of the Bitcoin transport protocol.

I wish you'd consider helping, Greg. It really does seem like a very reasonable upgrade; and, with just 3-4MB blocks, it would effectively give us a few years to figure out something more permanent.

I'm very familiar with all of the hardfork code in SegWit2x. It's actually a very simple change -- with very few new lines of code and just a few tweaked variables.
That is why I'm challenging everyone who claims it's not good. I'm waiting to hear from someone/anyone who has actually looked at the code before drawing that conclusion and promoting it as fact.
So far, everyone I've challenged has never even bothered to look at the code itself before describing it as no good, crappy, or shit code.

Please wake me up when someone within Core itself LOUDLY announces full speed ahead on a 2M/8M version of Spoonnet with a specific flagday (ie. 12,960 or 25,920 blocks after SegWit activation, or ~3/~6 months respectively).
Until then, Spoonnet is nothing more than a fantastic *idea* without hype...or hope.
Also remember, every extraordinary effort around here likely requires a genuine champion -- which, to me, means someone, or a group of someones, who loudly proclaims *"I'm going to make this happen,"* and then follows through accordingly.
Contrary to popular belief, leadership is actually critical for any large endeavor. Without it, there is no spark or rally point for the masses.
I'm still waiting for a champion in Core to step forward and openly challenge the assertion that *"we don't need a hardfork at this time."* Because, as you can see with the non-trivial support for the NYA, that ship has probably sailed, and we're facing a very significant split in November.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:58:24
All of the signaling and SegWit activation were done earlier in the beta testing cycle. All signaling stops once SegWit activates, as the hardfork is already locked in at that point, as well.
There is no bit signaling in SegWit2x after SegWit Activation.

You named quite a few interesting projects. 
However, what you did not name is a single coin that is *actually* being used for retail POS transactions in any recognizable capacity, while Bitcoin itself already works with more than 100k merchants and services around the globe.
I'm definitely not saying that it's impossible for one of those other experiments to someday prove useful. I'm just saying that it certainly hasn't happened to date. Not a single one of those projects can hold a candle to the volume and market share Bitcoin has over them. At best, those you named are notable for their unique twists, but none are currently very useful outside of their limited experimental bounds.
Someday? Can't rule it out, but it's not likely to happen any time soon. Bitcoin has a first-to-market advantage that will be very tough to beat -- especially if it evolves sufficiently in accordance with demand.
100 years from now, I personally believe there will be millions of different coins used for countless different reasons. However, there is a VERY high probability that they'll all be tied in with the "main" Bitcoin blockchain using one method or another.
Bottom line: Bitcoin is essentially the only race car on the real track right now. All of the others are still in the garage or over on the warm-up track testing out different tires and spark plugs...

A similar solution has been available with Bitcoin for several years now.
Check out [Onename](
My only issues with it are the problems associated with address re-use. You literally need to modify your Onename address details every time you generate a new address with your wallet software -- which you should be doing for every transaction.

There's also the Coinbase /named addresses, but those are obviously centralized and less anonymous...

That's the lecture I've been giving the children in r/btc for the last year, so I definitely understand the very distinct difference between competing *clients* and competing *consensus layers*.
The statement I made above about Core and BTC1 competing was in reference to clients only, not competing consensus layers. Core should adopt the SegWit2x consensus layer to remain in the game.
Competing consensus layers is what led to this stalemate bullshit in the first place.
I believe users should rally behind the one compromise solution that has finally brought the other two components of the system together -- SegWit2x. 
Businesses...miners...users.

@_date: 2017-07-26 04:50:58
Yes, but since ETH itself has *functionality* beyond just potentially making profit, it likely doesn't qualify as a security. The same is true of Civic and a few other ICO tokens that also have a specific *function* within their corresponding system/product/service.
There are still several others that do likely qualify as securities, though, and those may be in for some trouble.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:26:19
The network can function and progress just fine wth many competing client *implementations*. I don't care if there are 100 different dev teams putting out competing clients.
However, all progress on the network grinds to a halt once you introduce competing *consensus layers*. (This is where we are now)
There is a very large difference between those two sets of circumstances that many BU/EC supporters don't seem to understand at all.
IMO, the only non-hostile use of competing consensus layers is on Testnet. The moment you introduce a competing consensus layer to mainnet, it can and should be considered hostile -- and mitigated accordingly. 
I think the repercussions of doing so, and the unavoidable reactions of everyone in the system, should be obvious by now...

Covert Asicboost is not an "optimization of SHA256." In this case, it's a **cryptographic attack** on the PoW **process.** 
The exploit allows him to **skip** entire portions of expected work that are meant to be mandatory parts of the **process** that every miner must use.
The fact that he has somehow convinced others that this *isn't* an attack says a lot about what's become of the community.

That is not the primary intent. The primary intent is simply to provide a slightly larger blockspace AND SegWit simultaneously.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:35:14
The hardfork is set to activate automatically on any node still running SegWit2x at the set hardfork time -- which is SegWit activation + 12,960 blocks (~3 months).
If they still possess 75+% support at that time, the hard fork will likely be successful, and all economic nodes will likely follow suit to recognize the SW+2MB chain as "Bitcoin."

In March 2016, a Cornell University study indicated that we'd only lose ~500 nodes with an increase to 4MB blocks -- a number that has surely decreased since then. Their updated research, published two months ago, indicates the same level of decrease with 8MB blocks in the current network.

The problem with SegWit2x in this scenario is that the absolute soonest it can lock in with the required support is ~4 August -- it requires 80% support over 2016 blocks.
I'm pretty sure Jihan knows this, which is why I don't find his support for SegWit2x to be genuine. In fact, his own hardfork will be rejected by all the new SegWit2x nodes, as well.

SegWit2x **does** prevent covet Asicboost. It uses the exact same code for SegWit that you'll find in any BIP141 client -- to include both Core and the BIP148 client.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:40:48
It looks like they may activate the 2MB hardfork just two months after the SegWit activation, and they can do so because the text of the Agreement actually reads "**within** six months..."
I sincerely hope we can talk Jeff into delaying that a bit, as we'll need to give everyone else a little more time to decide whether or not to install their client.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:13:17


Wut? All I said is that you can't assume that all of the NY Agreement's signatories like SegWit *by itself*, because many of them only agreed to it in order to get the 2MB hardfork.


What are you talking about? That ~4MB size is simply the result of raising the base size to 2MB and also segregating the witness data. That's what happens with a "SW + 2MB" solution that so many have been asking for during the last 18 months. What sizes did you expect?


"Corporate altcoin"?  As opposed to what? The companies who signed the NY Agreement are the same ones running Bitcoin right now, so what would be different after simply updating our client software?
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:59:57

The hardfork is not before SegWit. In fact, the hardfork is coded to only activate with:  
*SegWit activation + (90x144 blocks)*  
Which is essentially SegWit activation + 3 months.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:49:53
Do you really believe that SegWit2x would gain 80% miner support in ten days? Or, are you suggesting that Jihan would hold off on his "UAHF" plan if SegWit2x has some lesser amount of support on August 1st?  If so, what amount do you think he'll consider sufficient?
I don't believe Jihan has any intentions on supporting SegWit2x after August 1st. I think that he believes this is his chance to take control of the entire network.

1) Core contributors were not involved in the NY Agreement.  
2) The working group for the NY Agreement claims that the signatories account for 83+% of Bitcoin's hashpower.  So, if that's true, and none of the participant back out, there is nothing Core contributors can code that could/would stop the hardfork from activating. 
3) If any exchanges agree to recognize SegWit2x as "Bitcoin" after the hardfork, there's nothing Core contributors can do to prevent that from happening.

That may be true of their Slack, but the mailing list is easy to gain access to. Luke told me in Mumble that he joined their mailing list without any problems, and I was able to join it, as well.

No, it doesn't. If all, or nearly all, of the exchange nodes follow the new consensus layer, along with a supermajority of hashing power, the hardfork will be successful.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:55:22
So, let me get this straight...
SegWit, an upgrade that *fundamentally alters the structure of all blocks*, sets the base size at 1M, the Max Weight at 4M, and results in blocks that are ~2MB = still "bitcoin" in your eyes.
However, a subsequent upgrade that simply changes the base size to 2M, the Max Weight to 8M, and results in blocks that are ~4MB = this is "not bitcoin" in your eyes? This is now an "alt coin"?
Let's see, how do I put this nicely? Hmm...
**What a load of horseshit. You're entirely full of it.**

@_date: 2016-07-08 00:24:44


Only theoretically.
Best case, I'm guessing the highest effective block size we'll see with SegWit in the next 12-24 months will be the tx equivalent of ~ 1.75MB, not 2MB+... and that's with near 100% integration of SW across the network, which I doubt we'll each any time soon.
The "HK consensus" was probably bullshit btw.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:01:23
Fork your GF if you want fork!
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:06:52


Actually, that size is only "expected" once nearly all transactions on the network are SegWit transactions.
My educated guess, based on real testing results with SegWit, is that we'll rarely see anything over 3.5MB for the first year or two that the SegWit2x hardfork is active.
Therefore, "4 - 8" isn't actually accurate *at all*.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:41:46
My body and several nodes are ready for ~4MB SegWit blocks that each contain 8,000 to 10,000 transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:30:41
Yes! It hasn't been thoroughly tested yet, but I expect it will result in ~4MB blocks, each containing 8,000 to 10,000 tx -- which is roughly double what we get with standard BIP141 SegWit and all SegWit tx using normal transaction behavior.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:38:53
Again, *even if everyone in the entire ecosystem uses only SegWit tx*, the total weight for the resulting blocks would still only fall between 4 and 4.5MB (based on normal user/tx behavior).
So, you can downvote and disagree all you want, but doing so won't change the reality of the resulting block weights.
**Caveat:** a fully functional and popular payment channel app, like LN, may change what is currently considered "normal transaction behavior," and the expected block weight may likely then become larger due to the more complex multi-sig tx required by such apps.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:15:23
Yes, it hinders covert Asicboost in the exact same way as standard BIP141 SegWit. In fact, besides the signaling methodology, everything about the SegWit2x softfork is identical to Core's 0.14 version of SegWit.

The coin is given that name by those who market and sell the product -- the exchanges, brokerages, and other services that comprise the "economic majority."
If those companies run SegWit2x nodes, then the resulting product they buy and sell, along with the miners, will simply be an upgraded version of "Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:28:23
What, specifically, are you referring to? I'm not sure what HFT or "cross coin pump and dumps" have to do with full blocks and spam.
HFT generally occurs off-chain on exchanges that allow automated (bot) trading, and swapping between coins generally occurs on those same exchanges, as well.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:16:51


Read BIP141 again. **Base Size** is defined as *"the block size in bytes with the original transaction serialization without any witness-related data, as seen by a non-upgraded node."*
Standard BIP141 has **Base Size** = 1,000,000 bytes, and **Block Weight** ≤ 4,000,000 bytes
Following the hardfork, SegWit2x will have **Base Size** = 2,000,000 bytes, and **Block Weight** ≤ 8,000,000 bytes. In this case, though, the definition for **base size** will change slightly since there will no longer be any non-upgraded nodes. The "as seen by..." portion of the definition will simply be dropped.
In reality, with these new values, the **Total Size** for each block will be ~4 to 4.2MB with normal transaction behavior.
The weighting will likely remain the same, but it hasn't been decided whether or not the discounts will be given to the non-segregated witnesses, as well (as suggested by Luke-jr for COOP).
Don't come at me like I don't know wtf I'm talking about when you yourself don't even know the definitions included in BIP141.

I'm a huge supporter of SegWit2x.
However, it is impossible for SegWit2x to lock in the forks before 4 August, as the SegWit2x code itself requires a full 2016 blocks with 80% support in order to lock in.
If they begin signaling on 21 July, even with an instant 80% mining support (which is extremely unlikely), the soonest they can possibly lock in the SegWit2x forks is ~4 August, and activation of the SegWit softfork would not occur until ~18 August (after yet another 2016 block period).
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:11:53
I don't recall BU ever having the support of 80-90% of miners, as well as support from other large economic nodes like Coinbase, Bitgo, and Bitpay.

Right, but he still understood and handled it accordingly.

@_date: 2017-06-11 20:24:44
I understand it just fine. However, I also understand the position of those who refuse to activate SegWit without a corresponding increase in the base size. 
SegWit2x will result in blocks that range between 0 and ~4.2MB in size, while providing between 8,000 and 10,000 transactions per block once SegWit transactions become the norm. That is a significant increase over the 4k to 5k transactions we'd have with just SegWit alone.
I do believe that many see the benefit of ~4MB SegWit blocks, and refuse to agree to anything less than that.
Can you really fault them for simply wanting more of an increase at this time? Even if that's not something you agree with, the position itself is both reasonable and logical. It also happens to be the exact compromise that many, including myself, have wanted since this entire scaling debacle began. That is why it's easy for me to understand why it gained wide support so quickly.
We shall see in late July how much integrity the signatories of the NY Agreement have. I sincerely hope that they stay true to their word and follow through accordingly.
The SW+2MB solution will do well to carry us through the next 2-4 years, as we spend that time researching, and hopefully discovering, a more effective and more permanent solution to on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:20:03
They (we) simply want more than what BIP141 by itself can provide. It is what it is, and some may rightfully argue that it's the market that's talking, and demanding, a bigger solution.

There are actually several other competent devs currently contributing to the project, including Justin Langston, Mike Belshe, James Hilliard, Jeffrey Christopher, and others. Hell, even Luke-jr audited some of the new code this morning and provided needed changes/fixes.
I wholeheartedly believe that they will all remain involved with the BTC1 project after the hardfork, and several Core contributors may even contribute code in the future.
There's no reason at all for them to simply fold up shop once the charter is realized.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:33:12
Because it's the exact solution I've been promoting for more than a year. I believe it's the perfect stop-gap solution to cover the next two or three years while we research me permanent long-term solutions.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:53:37
True. That surprised me, as well.
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:21:02
Correct. The 2MB hardfork automatically activates after 90x144 blocks on any node that's still running SegWit2x at that time.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:41:53
If the testing goes well for the SegWit2x client on Testnet5, then I'll likely install it on the 6 full nodes that I control. I'll have to run it past a few of my clients first, but they usually trust my opinions/recommendations when it comes to our nodes. 
They don't care much for the politics. All they really care about at the end of the day is that our nodes remain *functional.*
I've been pushing hard for SW+2MB for the last year, so SegWit2x is exactly what I've wanted all along. If/when SegWit2x becomes the new reference client, I do hope to see the majority of the Core contributors continue to work on future updates to improve the protocol (Schnorr sigs, aggregated sigs, confidential transactions, Tumblebit, sharding, fraud proofs, etc etc). I also hope to see Core itself merge the hardfork changes so that everyone can then choose which dev team to follow moving forward -- BTC1 or Core.
I wholeheartedly believe that SegWit2x will act as the perfect stop-gap solution for the next 2-4 years while we continue to research and test more effective and more permanent solutions for on-chain scaling. If no such solution is discovered in that time window, then perhaps another hardfork to 3M/12M (Base Size/Max Weight) will be necessary to extend the research window several more years.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:29:51
Correct. It comes down to one other distinction: centralized vs. decentralized layer 2 applications.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:27:47
If 83+% of the miners with a MAHF, along with many of the companies that comprise the "economic majority," switch over to SegWit2x -- per the NY Agreement -- then those 60,000+ node operators and all remaining miners will need to make the same choice as you and I.
Do we stay, or do we go?
I will elect to stay, and I'll be bringing my six nodes with me. Because SW+2MB works for me.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:48:40


I explained the entire process to you. Read it again. SegWit2x signals only on bit4 until after the grace period when BIP91 activates. Then, and only then, SegWit2x begins signaling on bit1.

The actual smart contract the funds were stolen from includes a delayed withdrawal function that will now allow them to programmatically ignore the theft event altogether (in the actual ethereum blockchain).

What's worse? Core is always free to merge the simple changes found in SegWit2x. They're not big changes at all.
The softfork portion of SegWit2x is fully compatible with Core -- only the signaling is different. In fact, the new BIP91 code in SegWit2x is meant to add to Core's BIP141 signaling on bit1 after SegWit2x hits the 80% lock-in. That will hopefully help the Core signaling reach the 95% they need for SegWit. (This is a direct result of Jeff collaborating with Core to coordinate the SegWit signaling).
The hardfork portion of SegWit2x is only a few extra lines and a few variables given higher values.
Too easy. 
What's the problem?
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:19:05


They did not, and no it isn't. I'm referring to a SW+2MB compromise hardfork, specifically. Core should have begun work on this exact hardfork some 15 months ago. Their refusal to do so is/was a colossal mistake.
I'm a fan of SegWit, and SW alone is definitely still preferred over any of the alternative consensus layers currently available (BU, Classic, etc). However, I've personally *always* considered SW+2MB a better compromise, and I've championed the idea for the last 15 months (while simultaneously putting the other Big Block clients and supporters on blast).
Core has my support, but only as long as no SW+2MB options are available.
SegWit2x is set to change all of that, so I sincerely hope that it's successful.

LOL! This article is so ridiculous, with insane levels of fear mongering that make Fox News look tame by comparison.
Core contributors are just as welcome to work on the BTC1 project as they are on the Core project. The only differences are the names of the lead maintainers.
The author believes SegWit2x is just the beginning of a long series of never-ending blocksize increases, while none of the participants in BTC1 have indicated that would be the case. In fact, I think they'd be hard-pressed to ever move beyond the initial bump to 2MB+SW because the companies that signed the Agreement would likely balk at any attempt to do so -- and the entire effort is useless without the support of everyone who signed the NY Agreement.
Just as it is with any hardfork, there's nothing the maintainers can do to *force* any network participants to run a future hardfork client with a bigger blocksize -- every user and miner would still be free to run the client of their choosing.
The fact of the matter is that BIP148 is an irresponsible assault on the network, with little or no thought given to the consequences of a careless chain split. Without economic majority and miner support, the UASF will be nothing more than pointless disruption.
Do you remember when shaolinfry first introduced the UASF? He stated, quite clearly, that he (or "we") would **not** execute the UASF if it did not gain the support of the economic majority beforehand.
When did that reasonable plan change? When did the entire endeavor switch to a position of *"fuck it, we're just going to do it anyways, regardless of economic node support"*?
It just seems odd that everyone has thrown that caution to the wind. It's very...un-bitcoinlike? So strange...
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:23:23
I believe that 8MB is beyond what the network can handle at this time, and that anything higher than 4 or 5MB will have a negative impact in decentralization. 
I also feel that any increase without SegWit's added benefits will result in an extensive delay for other incredible improvements that are in the pipeline -- and I'm not just talking about layer 2 developments, but those are certainly a terrible loss for everyone.
Standard blocks are also much easier to fill up for poison block attacks on the network, whereas SegWit blocks require much more complex and expensive transactions to even come close to filling up to Maximum Block Weight.
I feel that the ~3.5 to 4MB blocks provided by SegWit2x, each containing 8k to 10k transactions, would be more than sufficient for the next 3 to 4 years while we research a more dynamic and more permanent solution for on-chain scaling -- one that doesn't dramatically accelerate the trend toward centralization.

@_date: 2017-06-03 23:44:12
The **overt** Asciboost method can be detected by observing the blocks miners produce. To date, no miner has used this method.
The **covert** Asicboost method is undetectable through external observation, so there is no way to
 know whether or not any miner has ever used it.
What we do know is that Jihan added the circuitry for Asicboost to the chipsets inside Bitmain's popular mining equipment. So, he *could* simply use a special version of his firmware to run covert Asicboost, but we have no way to tell if he has ever done so.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:20:39
Yeah, I've been following the Drivechain discussions on the mailing list. As far as I'm concerned, the concept does show a lot of promise. 
However, their current timeline is unrealistic. We're probably months, or even years away from fully functional drivechains.
Either way, once it's ready, it may very well provide a large part of the answer for scaling.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:48:52
That 80% is a reference to the NY Agreement (aka SegWit2x). The signatories for that agreement apparently represent ~83% of the current hashpower.

Where? Just on their testnet? I'm not sure I follow what you're suggesting.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:56:10
I agree, but only insofar as the rejection is also carried out by the economic nodes that are run by all of the exchanges, brokerages, and others who provide the ramps on/off the network.
If the miners' MAHF has the support of BitPay, Coinbase, etc, it will be exceedingly difficult for the general publics' nodes to remain on a minority chain that lacks mining support and ramps.
There's a very good reason why every fork proposal to date has attempted to court the support of the exchanges and other ramps, and that is because it's those customer-facing institutions that have the power to redefine the product known as "Bitcoin," or at least try to; and those same institutions are how/where the miners sell their coins to continue funding their operations.  
If both the ramps and miners are in agreement on the new definition of "Bitcoin," then there's not much that other non-mining nodes can do to change that position -- regardless of quantity.
This is the same reason that a UASF will also fail if it has no support from the miners and economic nodes. The 60,000+ random user nodes can't really do shit by themselves, other than make a lot of noise and temporarily fork themselves off the network. Meanwhile, the miners and on/off ramp nodes just keep chugging along doing their thing -- creating, buying, and selling what they and the world refer to as "Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:30:38
If the hardfork goes through, they'll simply need to update their apps to be compatible with the 2MB version of SegWit. 
I've never looked at their ATM software, though, so I'm not sure how much work that would entail -- if any.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:32:46
I believe that ~4MB SegWit blocks are a perfectly reasonable and manageable upgrade that will suffice for the next 3 to 4 years while we research more dynamic and more permanent solutions for on-chain scaling.
I do not think that the solution we implement now needs to be one that solves the problem for decades or longer.

@_date: 2017-06-17 07:26:22
Luke is playing semantics games with you.
Just as regular SegWit (which has Max Weight = 4M) results in blocks that are actually just ~2MB in size with normal transaction behavior, SegWit2x (which has Max Weight = 8M) will merely double that and result in blocks that are actually just ~4MB in size with normal transaction behavior.
Luke knows this, but he's been going around yelling "OMG 8MB blocksize!" all week for shock value.
In real world use, the SegWit2x blocks will rarely break 4MB in size, just as normal SegWit will rarely break 2MB in size.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:20:55
There's no real way to predict SegWit adoption; however, even with blocks that contain *only* SegWit tx, the blocks would fall between 4 and 4.5MB (based on normal transaction behavior).
So, as I originally said, "2 to 4.5MB" is a much more accurate/realistic range for total weight over the next year or two.
Attacks could lead to larger blocks, but I'm assuming those are the exception, not the rule -- especially given the required complexity for SegWit attack blocks versus the simplicity of poison-block attacks on standard (aka legacy) blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:25:27
I agree that user nodes play a large roll.
However, miners and very large economic nodes also each play a large role.
If all/most of the large services and exchanges follow the miners, that just *might* be enough to trump user nodes.
It will be very interesting to see how it all unfolds.

SegWit only breaks covert Asicboost with SegWit blocks. The miners could still use covert Asicboost if they mine legacy blocks.

Each of my posts that covered the details for SegWit2x made it to the top of rBTC. 
However, the reactions were fairly mixed throughout that community -- there are at least a dozen hardcore BU/Ver/Jihan fanbois who are posting over and over again to attack SegWit2x in every way imaginable.
They genuinely believe that SegWit will mean the death of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-20 17:05:21
To be fair, at this point, SegWit2x is only a slightly modified version of Sergio's Segwit2mb BIP, which itself relied on BIP102 for the hardfork portion of the proposal.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:40:43
Jihan's thing is not SegWit2x. While he claims to support it, I don't believe that support is genuine.
SegWit2x is a separate effort from all the nonsense Jihan just announced.
Unfortunately, SegWit2x won't even have enough time to lock in support before August 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:27:31


Sure it does. If you examine their modified *consensus.h*, they created a new *MaxBlockBaseSize* function that returns (2 * 1000 * 1000) when the hardfork activates. 
That function increases the MAX_LEGACY_BLOCK_SIZE variable from 1,000,000 bytes to 2,000,000 bytes.
It activates the hardfork with that function exactly (90*144) blocks after SegWit activation (~3 months).
The MAX_LEGACY_BLOCK_SIZE variable establishes the space allocated for legacy tx and the non-witness data for SegWit tx, while the static MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT variable defines the max payload.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:17:44
It will actually be very unusual for SegWit2x blocks to *ever* be larger than 5MB, and most will likely be between 3 and 4MB in size with normal user/transaction behavior.

That's the count for full listening nodes. However, if you include full non-listening nodes in the count, there are more than 60,000.
That said, the UASF was supposed to only be attempted if it gained support of the "economic majority" -- that is, nodes that are run by all the major exchanges and services in the ecosystem. Which, as far as I can tell, haven't thrown any support behind the UASF.  
I personally feel that it would be reckless and irresponsible to still execute the UASF without such support.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:51:48
I never said that they could keep pace with Core, but it will still be interesting to see the competition develop.
If we assume for just one second that the SegWit2x hardfork is successful, and they somehow manage to fork Bitcoin to their new consensus layer, what do you think would happen with the Core repo? Do you think every last Core contributor would simply stop contributing to Bitcoin cold turkey? Would Core hardfork their minority chain with a new PoW and difficulty adjustment, and then continue on with that as though nothing ever happened? Would Greg and a few others finally build the completely new coin that he always mentions when asked these questions?
It's an interesting situation to consider, because ya just never know. I also love playing the "what if" game with scenarios like this...lol

    }  
return true;
You may be right, and they may be forced to increase Max Block Weight to 8,000,000. 
However, I think used a Max Weight of 4,000,000 bytes in his suggestions for the COOP BIP, so I'll have to look into how he planned to do so.

If anything, I think I'd prefer an outright bitcoin ban in China so that their coins would flood the rest of the markets.  This would, of course, lead to an immediate super-crash worldwide due to the increased supply side of coins; but, at least the other exchanges in the world would then be allowed to evolve naturally without China's chaotic prices dictating everything.
China's involvement in bitcoin is quite obviously holding the rest of the world back right now... grrrr

SegWit2x is not compatible with BIP148, and will not begin signaling Bit1 SegWit until after SegWit2x activation.  
SegWit2x signals its own support separately on Bit4 until activation.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:08:08
**The code for the SegWit2x hardfork is actually rather simple.**  
It involves two fairly straightforward variables that act as activation triggers (~3 months, or 90x144 blocks, after SegWit activates):  
*BIP102active* and *fSegwitSeasoned*.  
As well as two variables that actually enforce the hardfork changes (increase the block weight settings):  
*MaxBaseBlockSize* and *MaxBlockWeight.*  
That's it. There are a few other small changes to other lines of code that are meant to account for the signaling and size changes, as well as a few new tests, but everything else pretty much stays the same as Core's 0.14.1. Describing it as a complex change is pretty disingenuous.
**With Core 0.14.1 and SegWit2x softfork:**  
Base Size = 1,000,000 bytes.  
Max Block Weight = 4,000,000 bytes.  
Real-world block size results = ~2MB.  
**With SegWit2x hardfork:**   
Base Size = 2,000,000 bytes.  
Max Block Weight = 8,000,000 bytes.  
Projected real-world block size results = ~4MB.  
Any questions?
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:41:53
The basis for GBTC is actually the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), which is the trust where the actual underlying asset (bitcoin) is held. 
The BIT requires all members to hold their BIT shares for 12 months before they can transfer their BIT ownership certificates to the exchanges for conversion into GBTC shares that trade on the open market -- which obviously prevents any workable arbitrage opportunities from GBTC -&gt; BIT, and vice versa. This has the secondary effect of preventing any significant *price* correlation between GBTC and BTC. (The two markets tend to move in a similar fashion, but the GBTC price does not reflect an actual multiple of BTC).
The COIN ETF, on the other hand, *should* allow share holders to exchange their shares directly for the underlying asset (bitcoin). This may lead to both arbitrage opportunities and a direct correlation between BTC and COIN prices. In other words, since every COIN share represents 1/10 of a bitcoin, the BTC price may always move to 10x that of COIN (due to arbitrage).
That said, since most asset transfers for other commodity ETF's often take days/weeks to convert shares to assets, and vice versa, the arbitrage with COIN/BTC may ultimately be too slow to keep the two markets in sync. It will be very interesting to see how it all works out.
Bottom line:  COIN is much more like other "traditional" commodity-based ETFs (ie. precious medals, oil barrels, etc).  The current GBTC/BIT ETF is set up to work differently, so the two ETFs should have different effects on the overall BTC market.
Edit:  Since it will trade on the BATS exchange, COIN may also be much more easily added as part of IRAs and 401k accounts, so many people believe that fact alone will dramatically increase the interest (demand) in the COIN ETF.
Edit2: fractions.

The SegWit2x roadmap includes both a softfork and hardfork. Jeff has stated that they'll do nothing to change the way SegWit works as a soft fork to block Asicboost, AND that they're open to discussing ways to block **all** forms of Asicboost as part of the hardfork.
I'm cautiously optimistic about all of the above...

SegWit2x is simply doubling regular SegWit.
SegWit2x blocks will be ~4MB with normal usage versus standard SegWit blocks that are ~2MB with normal usage.
In fact, most SegWit2x blocks will be closer to 3MB during the first year, or so, because not all transactions will be SegWit transactions.
You know this.

Lock-in is a 336 block window, followed by one additional 336 block period before SegWit activation. So, best case, it's 00:00 on July 21st + 672 blocks.

It's more like 2 to 4.5MB, but ok...
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:13:54
That was simply an update to further reduce the signaling period. The BIP91 signaling requirements went from 2016 blocks (originally) to 672 blocks (yesterday) to just 336 blocks (today).
The 672 block version of BIP91 that was merged yesterday had the bit1 compatibility included, as well.

I believe we can maintain both decentralization and censorship resistance with ~4MB SegWit blocks. The Cornell University study indicated that we wouldn't lose many nodes with 4MB blocks.

@_date: 2017-06-16 15:21:22

@_date: 2017-06-16 15:50:00
The problem is that the SegWit2x devs interpreted the "within 6 months" aspect of the charter to mean "within 6 months **of the Agreement itself**," and not "within 6 months of SegWit activation."
That's why the hardfork is currently set for SegWit activation + 3 months.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:14:37
The hardfork will still automatically **activate** on any/all nodes still running the SegWit2x client at that time, regardless of what other nodes may be running.
Whether or not the garden is successful is an entirely different story, and certainly still TBD.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:53:46
Regular SegWit BIP141 actually averages 2 - 2.1MB blocks with normal usage behavior.
SegWit2x will therefore average 4 - 4.2MB blocks with normal usage behavior.
After pushing for a SW+2MB solution for more than a year, I'm personally very excited to see SegWit2x gain traction.

I didn't fail to consider your viewpoint.
I considered it and wholeheartedly disagree.
Therefore, I will do my best to work against it in every way.
I wish for my viewpoints to prevail, so that's what I will work toward. I do not seek compromise, but plenty of compromise will naturally occur during the process.  
Let me repeat: In the end, I sincerely hope for nothing less than my own viewpoint to prevail. Getting as close to that scenario as possible is my goal. I will consider anything less as simple motivation to continue fighting for total victory.
Why settle and set the end goal as anything less?

I don't trust Bitpay's rates any more than others. In fact, I trust it even less because I know their entire business plan is designed around their rate and built-in margins.

Very few members of reddit will be willing to link any real identity information to their usernames here, so it's unlikely many would continue using changetip if they were required to have highly-regulated Coinbase accounts just for tipping.
So, what could/would happen to the thousands of changetip accounts that are currently pseudononymous?

You can easily buy that much for one fixed price (per bitcoin) on Coinbase, minus a 1% fee.
I've bought much more than that through Coinbase in the past without any issues or slippage whatsoever.
Just be sure to withdraw it to your own private wallet as soon as you're comfortable doing so, because leaving it on Coinbase means that you don't really own the coins yet -- they do.

That's not true. There was a ton of merging activity on the repo last night, and the SegWit2x mailing list began discussions on the testing process, as well.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:08:06
No, it's not. If they install SegWit2x prior to July 21, the signaling window is only 336 blocks long for lock-in , and then an additional 336 block period before SegWit activation. With that full 672 block cycle, the SegWit activation, Bit1 signaling, and rejection of non-SegWit blocks would begin on or around 27 July, 2017.

The changes for the hardfork are not very numerous or complex. You can easily review all of the new code for the garden in less than two minutes.
The testing of these simple changes will occur for 3-4 weeks prior to RC1.
I don't necessarily like the short timeline, but it's not like BIP148 and Jihan have us much of a choice in that regard...

No argument there. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:41:52
SegWit2x still breaks covert Asicboost in the exact same way that the current SegWit rollout breaks Asicboost.
The only difference in the hardfork portion of SegWit2x is an increase in the Base Size and Max Weight variables -- instead of 1000000 and 4000000 bytes, respectively, the SegWit2x hardfork code simply bumps those variables to 2000000 and 8000000 bytes.
Go check out their repo. It's all right there for all the world to see...
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:10:56
Your examples are the reason I'm personally unhappy with the extremely short timeline for this hardfork.
However, I'm still perfectly content with the idea of a hardfork to upgrade Bitcoin to SW+2MB. Core themselves should have begun the process to do so 15 months ago.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:23:25
SegWit2x DOES block covert Asicboost. They don't plan to change anything in the BIP141 code for the softfork, and they're leaving it in place when they do the 2MB hardfork. They may even add a block for overt Asicboost, as well, if they can figure out the fix prior to release.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:47:18
It is impossible for SegWit2x to lock in the forks before 4 August, as the SegWit2x code itself requires a full 2016 blocks with 80% support in order to lock in.
If they begin signaling on 21 July, the soonest they can lock in the forks is 4 August, and activation of the softfork wouldn't occur until around 18 August (after yet another 2016 block period).
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:53:08

@_date: 2017-06-15 21:53:47
Fair enough. I've deleted the post until I dig into it some more.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:51:22
The problem is that the SegWit2x devs interpreted the "within 6 months" aspect of the charter to mean "within 6 months **of the Agreement itself**," and not "within 6 months of SegWit activation."
That's why the hardfork is currently set for SegWit activation + 3 months.
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:05:04
I'm not sure how you can still argue that all of that 80% is ok with SegWit by itself, when it's quite clear that isn't the case.
The NY Agreement's SW+2MB compromise has always been the best answer to this dilemma, which is why the support for such a solution is so high.
Much of that 83% would outright reject SegWit by itself -- which is why only ~30% of the hashpower currently signals for SegWit by itself.


The words "thin ice" imply some sort of repercussions. What would those be, and who/what would enforce them?
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:06:43
If the SegWit2x hardfork is successful, the BTC1 project becomes the primary repo and the reference client for Bitcoin.
Put plainly, the consensus layer in SegWit2x becomes the reference consensus layer. Other dev teams, like Core, would need to decide whether or not to make their projects compatible with the new consensus layer. If they do decide to remain compatible, they would merge the required changes, and then continue competing for users in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:47:59
You can have more of both. The first 2,000,000 bytes are allocated for legacy tx **and** the non-witness data for SegWit tx.
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:28:41
It's a 336 block signaling period with 80% to lock in, and then another 336 block period before SegWit actually activates. 
The Bit1 signaling and orphaning of non-SegWit blocks will not begin until that full 672 block cycle is complete, and SegWit actually activates on SegWit2x clients.
If all goes well, that activation will occur on or around 27 July, 2017.
The BIP9 activation of SegWit on Core clients will then require ~4 weeks to activate, but only if the 95% threshold is met -- which should be the case, though, after all of the above clients begin orphaning all non-SegWit blocks. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:38:51
They have only said that as it relates to the initial release, and up to the point of the hardfork. 
After the dust settles from the hardfork, the BTC1 team will very much welcome any/all future contributions from the rest of the developer community.
Projects like schnorr signatures, aggregated signatures, tumblebit, etc, will all be more than welcome to submit their code to the BTC1 repo in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:16:08
I think Greg's post is kinda nonsense. I managed to gain access to their mailing list without any issue whatsoever. I didn't need to agree to anything or pledge to only be supportive -- I just signed up, and boom, instant access after the normal linuxfoundation confirmation process.
I honestly believe that Greg and Luke may be the only ones who didn't gain access, and that's probably because of their toxic personal histories with Jeff. 
I'm a nobody, and yet I was able to join without a second thought.
Hell, even Adam Back was contributing on their mailing list.


This one literally involves a handful of new variables and some short if-else code for activation. You could easily review every new line of code in less than ten minutes.
The only issue I have with the entire project is the excessively short timeline. Everything else has seemed perfectly kosher to me.

I think what he's trying to explain to you is that the market will naturally determine what the "acceptable" fee is simply by observing what people actually pay for their transactions in every block, not via social feedback from "the community." 
If the blocks remain full with fees that are $20, or more, then obviously the free market has determined that such fees are acceptable. If the blocks are no longer full at those high rates, then obviously the acceptable fee is lower than that amount.
It's not up to you, Adam, or any other individual to determine what is acceptable to the entire market, as the market will naturally and collectively determine that for itself.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:31:08

The username/password requirement is the archaic process all banks use to link accounts -- my IRA account was linked to my two checking accounts the same exact way. This is required to facilitate Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT).
Second, all of their draconian requirements and delays are the result of burdensome regulation and compliance with Federal laws. It's sad that they've had to conform to such nonsense, but that's how the U.S. treats most businesses.
Third, it's completely normal for EFTs to take 3-6 days in the legacy banking system -- which happens to be one of the major reasons Bitcoin (or something like Bitcoin) will eventually replace the old system.
Finally, the reason they are asking about your previous web history is because they employ very intrusive browser cookies that "fingerprint" your web browsers and machines. They do so in the name of security -- claiming that it helps them identify malicious access to your account -- but, those same cookies give them a ton of information they could use against you when determining risk. They also run open source information/background checks on your name and other personally identifiable information in order to categorize -- and often mischaracterize -- your risk factor.
It's definitely a pain in the ass, and sad, that it's come to this... but, your animosity should probably be redirected toward the asshole regulators and law makers who place these absurd requirements on companies like Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:58:51
You write in a very hostile tone, but I'll respond anyways...


The 83% figure was published by the Digital Currency Group in the announcement of the NY Agreement itself. It is their claim, not my own.
That said, the companies on their list of signatories do control a very large amount of hashpower. I haven't done the math myself, but it's quite possible that 83% is accurate.


I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but I've been involved with this experiment for long enough not to take this type of bullshit from the likes of you. Either chill the fuck out, or I'm done trying to have a civil conversation with you about SegWit2x.
If you knew better, and you knew anything about me, specifically, then you'd realize that I've been supporting SegWit and fighting against the idiots in rBTC for the last six months. I am hated over there for my support of Core and SegWit, and the many harsh things I've had to say about EC and BU.


SegWit2x might succeed, or it might fail. Your prediction is noted, but that's all it is: a prediction...or, more accurately, a guess.


I agree. I absolutely despise Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, and 99% of the idiots in rBTC.
That said, I do NOT despise Jeff Garzik, Mike Belshe, Justin Langston, Barry Silbert, or any of the others directly involved in the SegWit2x project. They are decent people with good intentions, and the SegWit2x project is an honest effort to make a reasonable compromise on scaling. The result is a SegWit client and ~4MB blocks that each contain 8,000 to 10,000 transactions with lower fees and faster first confirmation times.
You just really need to chill the fuck out...

Mainly because none of the actual code is being developed "in secret." It's all being done right out in the open on Github, just as it is with Core and most other client repos.
I also think the only two people blocked from joining the SegWit2x mailing list were Luke and Greg. I haven't heard anyone else complaining about being denied, and even Adam Back is on the SegWit2x mailing list participating in the discussions.
The Slack channel may be the one private medium, but I haven't seen any changes to the code that weren't also discussed out in the open prior to their inclusion.

was actually correct in most of his response, so I'm not sure what I can add other than to say that there is no trust within the community. That is why none of the signatories to the NY Agreement are willing to simply activate SegWit right now, using the current bit1 method of signaling/activation. Doing so would possibly lead to games being played with the signaling for the 2MB hardfork later on -- a risk they're not willing to take.
They will all wait for the SegWit2x client to become available, which will be sometime in July, and signaling is scheduled to begin on or before 21 July.

It appears that they have, because the code itself tells my story. The current build is exactly as I describe in the OP.
They have not touched the MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT variable. AFAICT, it remains static at 4,000,000 bytes.
That could certainly change later in the development cycle, but it would be a little odd if they intend to change it after the Alpha build that's due out tomorrow, or after the first full week of testing.
Check out the code for yourself. If you see something that I missed, please let me know and I'll delete this post.

I have no doubt that Core will remain relevant; however, if SegWit2x is successful, Core would have to merge the 2M/8M hardfork code to do so.
They could even become the prominent client again if they continue to add more amazing features than the BTC1 crew -- especially if those features are very attractive to miners.
Then again, I guess BTC1 could just take all the code for those features and continue to act as some sort of buffer between miners and Core. That would be fairly strange and somewhat controversial, though.
(I think the guys in the podcast above got *some* of this correct)
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:08:17
Nobody is saying you have to. However, if SegWit2x does become the new reference client for Bitcoin, the choice will be to either continue participating, or leave the network altogether.
That's not a tough choice for me, though, as I believe Bitcoin will continue to be the defacto standard for all crypto currencies moving forward.
Having ~4MB SegWit blocks, 8k to 10k transactions within each block, and LN on top, doesn't sound all that bad to me.
@_date: 2015-02-23 07:09:45
First, no you can't. If they have to print and have you sign a receipt, it takes about the same amount of time to generate the QR and pay with Bitcoin.
Second, tell that to the merchant who gets his money the same day with no additional fees if you use Bitcoin versus the several day delay and ~3% fees he pays every time you use a credit card.
You're also handing the merchant your entire identity and access to all your credit every time you pay with a card... do you consider those factors a bonus?

Isn't that three day delay mostly a result of the lack of an efficient trustless ledger? In other words, the ACH dependency on centralized clearing houses is the bottleneck, not the software or bandwidth... correct?
I believe the reason Bitcoin will always win out, in terms of trust and efficiency, is its lack of any need for a centralized, costly, and inefficient clearing process.

That's incorrect. The patent risk Jihan was referring to is the ridiculous claim that SegWit itself infringes upon other existing patents -- as in, legal risks. Jihan was NOT referring to SegWit interfering with his own Asicboost patent.

Yes, but a large portion of that 80% is only ok with SegWit if it's paired with a 2MB base size. 
In other words, you can't equate that to 80% support for SegWit by itself, since only ~30% seem to be ok with that possibility (per signaling).
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:45:37
SegWit2x does NOT preserve covert Asicboost. It blocks it the exact same way standard BIP141 SegWit blocks it.

@_date: 2017-06-19 21:21:13
Correct. The promise by Luke and Co. was simply to develop the proposal for the 2MB hardfork, not guaranteeing that said proposal would gain support.
However, if we're being honest here, Luke never really delivered a straightforward 2MB hardfork proposal. The proposal that he claims sufficiently addressed the Agreement was done ridiculous hardfork involving a decrease to 300kb blocks following by several years of incremental increases.
In fact, until Segwit2mb was purposed by Sergio, and Oliver's SW-Dgov proposal a few months later, no straightforward 2MB hardfork proposals even existed.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:20:45


With a claim like that, I can only assume that you've examined the SegWit2x hardfork code yourself, right?

His point us that it's not a 1:1 relationship. A single wallet address can actually represent the holdings of X number of people, wherein X is unknown to all but the owners of the address. Hell, even they may not know X given the existence of multisignature addresses and the fact that the holdings in any one wallet (or account) can actually belong to multiple people.
Example: some of the bitcoins held in my m-of-n wallet address actually belong to my parents, and my wife also legally owns half of those that are "mine." Both my parents and my wife hold keys of their own to the same address. That is four people with a single address. Etc etc.
Now, imagine that situation on a global scale...

Very interesting!  I'm in the process of spinning up a security consulting practice focused on the digital currencies space, specifically, so I'll be in touch to get more involved shortly.
Areas where I may be able to contribute significantly: insider threat and the intersection of cyber/technical security concerns (listening devices--both RF and IP-based, physical implants, supply chain concerns, side channel attacks on network devices, etc).

Why? If anything, I'd say it's a good thing that none of the Core devs were included in the Agreement. As a result, this time, "Core" cannot be blamed for any aspect of the SegWit2x project, nor can they be held accountable if it falls through.
The good news is that some of them, like Eric, have even stepped up to offer their assistance and expertise during SegWit2x's development phase.


True. But, as long as they have a super-majority of hashpower, as well as several major services/exchanges, the result will likely retain the "Bitcoin" name without any issues, and the transition will not be as painful as it otherwise could be with a more contentious fork.
This one may actually stand a chance... if egos and politics don't get in the way. That's a big "if," though.

Jeff corrected that statement late yesterday, and the September date no longer applies.
The hardfork will automatically activate at **(SegWit Activation block + 12,960 blocks)**, which is ~3 months.

He has also taken the lead to develop the new SegWit2x client for the NY Agreement working group -- which is actually a good thing IMO.
So, I think we can take the bad with the good when it comes to Jeff. He's not an enemy of bitcoin.

If you're going to paste this response everywhere, I'll paste my response everywhere:  
I honestly believe that Luke and Greg may have been the only people not accepted for the mailing list, and that probably has a lot more to do with their past personal relationships with Jeff than anything else.
I had absolutely no issues joining the mailing list, and it didn't involve agreeing to anything. It was just the normal linuxfoundation process for joining any list. Hell, even Adam Back is/was on their mailing list contributing to the discussion.
Any claims that SegWit2x is not truly open source are ridiculous.

Seriously, though, why not wrap mining software with a game client?  The coin network itself could support a secure social aspect, and mini-games would provide for ways to mine additional (alternative) coins. 
ie. The game client mines for bitcoin with mini-games that also mine for namecoin.

When the signaling on bit4 reaches 80% over a signaling period of 2016 blocks, it will lock in both SegWit and the hardfork. 
SegWit will then activate another 2016 blocks later, and the hardfork will activate ~3 months after SegWit activates. The SegWit activation will also turn on bit1 signaling -- this is meant to help Core nodes reach their 95% BIP9 activation requirement for SegWit.
You should really review the latest SegWit2x code before commenting on this subject again. I've read every line of it (it's not that much new code).
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:23:44
If you readily admit that you know nothing about coding, how can you then, in the same breath, describe the code for SegWit as "overly complex"? Who are you parroting at that point, and why have you taken their word for anything?


It's not simple -- there are secondary and tertiary effects that must be considered when changing the variables in the consensus layer aspects of the code; and many of those effects concern the health and security of the entire network.
It's extremely frustrating when non-technical participants in the system attempt to dictate changes to the technical aspects of the system based on nothing but wants and feels.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:34:05
again, though, where is that seemingly intangible threshold defined in law or legal precedent?
Are you saying that if these coins were mined in Guild Wars 2, and 15 billion people around the globe decided to play and trade them for real currency, the government would be able to legally step in and regulate the video game?

Yes, but it is literally impossible for SegWit2x to lock in with 80% support before August 1st if they begin signaling on the currently scheduled 21 July. 
The code for SegWit2x requires a full 2016 block period with 80% support in order to lock in. If signaling begins 21 July, the earliest possible date for lock-in is around 4 August, 2017. 
Jihan knows this, so his support and encouragement for SegWit2x is just lip service. The UAHF is his primary plan.
Ironically, Bitmain's hardfork will kick every new SegWit2x client off the network along with 60,000+ Core nodes -- as all of them will still be set to reject blocks larger than 1MB on August 1st.
The only nodes in the entire network that will accept his large blocks as valid are the ~700 BU and Classic nodes, as well as the mystery clients he claims are already in development. Every other node in the entire system would be on the legacy chain.
Does Jihan really have the hashpower to pull this off? Hmm

It could be argued that the halvening is already priced in given the steady rise for the last six months.
I am surprised, though, that the Brexit hasn't led to a faster rise. I'm guessing that's mostly due to the inability (or unwillingness) of most large investors to quickly/easily gain access to the foreign bitcoin exchanges.
Gemini and GDAX simply don't have the required liquidity to support larger market orders, as was demonstrated by GDAX's ridiculous low-volume spike on the night of the Brexit vote.

1. How is that any different than the exchange that takes place when you trade coin for cash at any one of the legal exchanges?  ie. If I buy/sell Bitcoins from/to Coinbase, Coinbase owes me the value.
2. How does market cap -- or, more accurately, "popularity" -- determine legalities?  What if 15 billion people simply decided to play Second Life, and their game ran itself in individual instances spread out on a secure distributed network instead?

I understand arbitrage quite well, thank you.  It's very difficult to pull off in the current system when most of the large exchanges don't allow for the transfer of cash.
Besides, arbitrage would not explain why some very large buys or dumps happen almost simultaneously on multiple exchanges.  The candlesticks simply shouldn't be so closely tied together when different volumes and walls are involved... but they do happen that way, which is often very odd.
