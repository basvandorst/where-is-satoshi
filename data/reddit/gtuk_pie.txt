Gold has the ideal chemical properties to serve as money and a good store of value—just as aluminum is good for making aircraft, steel is good for building structures, uranium is good as nuclear fuel.
Just because a material or element is expensive doesnt mean it is ideal to use it as a currency.

Your argument is basically btc is wannabe gold, except gold is useful, beautiful, stable (btc is volatile), proven by thousands of years of history.
Also you can easily buy gold anytime you want...

I don't think btc could last big wars or cyber warfare. The fact is, most people don't trust bitcoins stability at all, its just speculation.
People trust gold much more, thousands of years has proven its stability, even during great inflations, world wars, the cold war, famines, etc. Btc proved nothing so far. During the time of Christ, an ounce of gold would buy a Roman citizen his toga (suit), a leather belt, and a pair of sandals. Today, one ounce will still buy a good suit, a leather belt, and a pair of shoes.

I know exactly how btc works, and I still don't trust it, just as many professionals in the bank/business sector.

Better do a research next time you write stupid shit like this. It was expensive because Wöhler couldn't produce much aluminium with his mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium method. But when Henri Sainte-Claire could mass produce a lot with his aluminium trichloride reduced by sodium method, it became cheap.
Same what happened to purple dye. It was one of the most expensive substances, but then someone discovered how to mass produce it cheap.
So unless you find a philosophers stone, or discover how to transmutate gold, it won't fall. It is not about people suddenly decided aluminium is now worth much less lmao.
