TxID is Transaction ID. Every transaction (and ID) is listed on the blockchain - I was asking so you (or we) could take a look at the transaction to see if there is any funny business.
See if you can open your wallet and get details on the transaction itself. I don't have it installed so I can't give steps but try selecting your sent transaction and look for options or details etc. Hopefully there is a txid listed - if so, take a look at it (copy paste) it to blockchain.info and verify it has actually confirmed.
Also, when you get into contact with airbits support, they will ask for this information so it is a good idea to have that handy.

Not at all. But like everyone here who has been waiting, what a year?,  everyone just would rather say "Wake me up when you have a fully working marketplace on all OS's and all Mobile OS". 
95% of people couldn't care less about the progress of OpenBazaar, they just want it working already so they can use it. Honestly, it's at the point (maybe for me) that I would be fine with a centralized marketplace website (not a program I have to install) that charges me 5% (instead of 15% w eBay/PP) to sell. I (along with plenty others) just want a place to buy and sell goods with bitcoin so we can progressively move the market in a positive direction. I'm over waiting for a decentralized p2p marketplace that I need to install on my system.. and for what? To sell drugs and other illegal items? I give 2 shits about illegal transactions. I've got games, hardware, recreational gear, art- legal items to sell and I'm sure there are tons of other people in my position, whether it be buying or selling, that want to do the same.
The holdup on OB seems to be building the anon p2p structure itself - because creating a marketplace that's centralized would take a month, max.
Eh, this comes off more as a rant because it really is. I'm just tired of seeing OpenBazaar posts and literally shit hasn't changed, at all.
I had the idea of a marketplace (the next BitMit)  before OpenBazaar and wrote about it here in a comment, and the developers of OpenBazaar (before it was OB) had replied saying "We want to do something just like that" and had reached out to me but I'm no developer but more of an operations manager.. the idea fizzled to me and then OB was born. A year later they have nothing to show for it other than progress of development (which I'm not bashing) but this day in age time is money and this project is taking fare longer than it should.
Personally, a program I need to install to sell/buy is not going to work. Quote me on that now. It will not work. You need a functional website (and mobile app), not a program to install. That is such a bad decision that causes 5x the amount of work to put out. Doubt me? Look how far OB has come.
People will draw the conclusion of "WTF are you doing to help this?" - I've been in the bitcoin industry for years and have accomplished and experienced a good amount, a lot. I have office space to offer developers in Southern California - I have a ridiculous amount of first hand experience with almost every aspect of bitcoin other than development (group buys, mining, trading, wholesale, colo data center hosting, merchant acceptance of bitcoin and more). Everyone is so quick to judge (and downvote) that they themselves do not want to do anything to  actually have bitcoin progress. I'm a very open arms type of guy and anyone who has met me or dealt with me knows exactly that.
TLDR; OpenBazaar is not where it should be. Marketplace that needs to be installed on your computer will not work. I can offer workspace and personal experience to developers.

As long as you have a wallet backup and/or backup of your seed you will be fine when you recover.
Now, with that you said above, my suggestion would be Electrum instead of Bitcoin-QT. When you install Electrum and setup a new wallet for the first time it will have you right down your seed - Make sure you do that and save it in a safe location(s) and you'll be  able to restore your wallets in the event your PC crashes.

Now to clear this up as well, when you setup your account on the ATM it showed you a QR code and you used your phone to send this transaction correct? What showed on the screen after you sent the coins?
I was just thinking now that maybe the ATM took a long time to confirm the transaction. If it's not a hassle for you I'd say try going back to the ATM, log into your account and see if there is a balance for you to withdrawal.

I understand it (temp) solves an issue but it's not doing any good. Yes you *can* get paid in bitcoin through a 3rd party but your job has no clue you are doing this because those services just have you direct deposit into their system. Your job only sees a bank account that they deposit your check into - leaving your job completely unaware of the bitcoin demand. Which was the point I was trying to make. I agree the 3rd services are better than nothing but I'm looking at the bigger picture/end game. We've had these 3rd party services for years now and nothing has really changed as far as adoption or demand. If anything, we have gone backwards with merchants dropping acceptance of bitcoin. We've seen more posts on saying XYZ stopped accepting bitcoin than XYZ is now accepting bitcoin.

That's only a bandaid to the real issue and doesn't really solve anything. Companies need to be *aware* of bitcoin - a third party service does not do that. Merchants need to be *aware* they are accepting bitcoin (and having customers pay with bitcoin)- not having customers use a giftcard (that's not bitcoin).

Not that I know of. but when We sell Mining gear (usually used) we price it directly on difficulty and earnings of said miner... Which now that I think of it has an indirect link to USD since I personally feel btc/usd is correlated to mining profits and bottom line

Small talk leads to , "Oh, so what were you going to spend on this cash on, fancy gift?"
Just because it didn't escalate to that question with you doesn't mean it's not happening, or being told to tellers to ask.
Source: Any bank teller/branch manager who has passed the 3 month probation will agree that they give you a "mini script" for small talk conversation, which you said you receive. 
If you're a lucky one, then more power to you. You change it to 5K and you let me know how that goes.

Dear valued Bitmit user,
Unfortunately we have to shut down Bitmit because of upcoming law regulations in our country. Our server is going to be turned off in about four weeks. Please complete your orders and withdraw all your Bitcoins within that timeframe.
We are very sorry for that Sad We really enjoyed the collaboration with this awesome Bitcoin community! :*

Additionally, you know it's only 1% to use BitPay right? And that's up to $10,000 in transactions. If you do more than $10K in a day, it's fee is capped at $1/day. $1 a day to process bitcoin.

Find out why you were targeted to begin with.
Additionally, have you and how did you even confirm once they are paid everything will be "back to what it was?".
How do you know there isn't another backdoor waiting for you? Once you pay them it gets fixed and them BAM, all over again.
Honestly, once you pay them- why do you believe they will actually do anything after that?

@_date: 2014-06-02 15:23:47
I've been working on something as well but there just isn't enoughtime in the day to really get it done.
Basically, we need a BitMit.com replacement.
With that said, I say make your site less "you" and make it more of a service. Ala, "CoinBarter" vs "Bucks Cool Trading Website", feel me? This alone will grab more attention.
Drop your fees. This is a new and untested platform. I know it's only a quarter, but why? It's not like you're really offering a real service, it's a mock-up site with no users etc. I know you say you can test it for free, but just drop your rates altogether to begin with.
Other than that, I know what else needs to be done on your site but I'm sure you're well aware of that.
Let me know if you'd like any other criticism or tips.
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:10:26

I'm not seeing what the issue is.
End of day, add your totals on your iPad (£XXX, BTC XXX) add it to the main till?
Also, are you cashing out to £ or are you holding the BTC?
Either way, just note both at the end of day (BTC and £ and the current value of BTC/£).
Maybe I'm misunderstanding though, is this what you meant?
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:34:43
I agree to avoid spammers, but until your site actually sees that problem, drop the fees and then adjust as needed. You're scaring off more potential customers than you are with keeping the site spam-free.
The feedback system is great and a must, so you can begin creating a trust history. That is also double-edged due to scammers nowadays. It wouldn't really be **that** hard for me to make 4 accounts buy and sell to each other, get my trust up and then begin scamming people. So, it's a difficult role you're taking on, sir.
I'll add my 2c whenever I get a chance. :)

@_date: 2014-06-02 18:33:20
Should have made this a self post instead of a link to your sale, hence people downvoting you.
is where you list it
Anyway, the escrow on that purchase is going to be a huge fee, avoid it and deal face to face on the transaction if you can. 
My suggestion would be to use BitPay for the purchase/sale of the condo. They have a few different merchant plans and if you play your cards right you can pay little to nothing in fees if you pick the monthly plan with BitPay and do the sale through their system.
Additionally, if you further need help with this, check us out at and you can use the [HELP] prefix in your post to get some assitance. :)

I think this is the first step to getting stores (within the mall) to accept.

Don't force it or it will come off preachy. I got my local bar(s) on the verge of accepting but they need that incentive.. So I'm offering a tablet (Nexus 7) for them to use as a checkout device.
Companies (unless smart) do not see the benefits of accepting BTC esp if they have to pay to start accepting it.
So with me, I just got in really good with the owner/tenders and slowly over time showed them the benefits of bitcoin. Honestly, you can't just throw out an idea and say do it, if it's good it will play out over time and they will see.
With that being said, if you do all the legwork for them and set it up I'm sure they would be more open to accepting.
Ala, "I"ll setup your online account, I'll set it so it auto converts to USD so you dont lose money, set it to auto deposit into your bank daily etc."
And most of all, explain the savings just alone on FEES!
BUT! Make sure you're fluent in all of the above or they will say "oh jeez, what did I just get myself into?"
I do free consulting anytime I'm at a business and the opportunity arrives.
I'm wanting to setup a consulting group that is international. 
Ie. You go to our website and it gives you options like

I was just adding to what the guy said above you.
There will only be 21M BTC in existence. So, if you own 21BTC, theoretically you are a person who is 1 in a Million because only so many people will own that many coins.

Exactly. The fact that this opportunity is right in front of his face and he chooses to react this way clearly shows and solidifies that yes, he is a "student" still. 
I mean, if I were him in that position I would drop everything and make p2pool my priority. With that said maybe he's finishing up a crazy degree doing something that won't make him nearly as successful as this.

Is there a reason you prefer this over a paper wallet? I ask this because I see a lot more points of failurewith an old phone being cold storage rather than a paper wallet.
Also, if you're putting coins on your phone using a service then that's hot storage, not cold.

This really isn't any savings at all since they decided to RAISE all the prices before the sale.
I'll skip this "sale".
Going to buy bulk EVGA 1300W G2's - last week they were 180 (149 after rebate!), a couple days ago 192 and today when the sale started? **$230.99** - no thanks.

Has nothing to do with bitcoin, sounds like the merchant has an error (exchange rate error?) or a user error.

For local places, it's usually the discount you may receive, or if it's not always about **you**, consider that the merchant accepting it is also supportive of it. With that being said, I will go out of my way to pay with bitcoin to spread awareness and to show support.
I buy beers all the time with Bitcoin, easy peasy.

I doubt that scenario would arise but that's where you have to put the trust into everyones words who say it's legit.
Also, this is another reason why you should make more wallets with less amounts. knock on wood, worst case it's only 1 wallet that would have the issue with small amounts rather than your wallet with all coins.

Maybe change words from "need" to something like "we suggest". You can confuse a lot of newbies thinking this is required for them to use bitcoin.

Sadly, my personal checking accounts on numerous banks are now closed. I deal now with CapitalOne 360 and the AMEX Serve card.

Since every reply assumes you're in it for the money, I'll actually answer your question instead ignoring your question and giving you an honest answer.
cex.io probably has one of the best cloud-based mining interfaces you can use. You also have the ability of buying/selling your cloud-mining via tradebook on their website.
They offer referrals to get more %, they offer 2FA etc.
If you're looking to do cloud-mining (today, today) they are probably the best. If you're looking to invest to earn money, you will most likely not earn any ROI. I say this because to earn any ROI you usually have to be one of the first front runners.

This was a in person trade? No a cash deposit correct?
So in this case you manually put it into escrow (LocalBitcoins does NOT auto-escrow in person trades)
The only thing to do is message their support and they can cancel the trade on their end.

Haha yes! "The future of banking."

Not necessarily but this is the case here. I suggested if he's too overwhelmed to pass the torch to someone else who cares enough about the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:02:57
I'm not saying it is at all! But his attitude of, "Meh, if I had more donations I'd put p2pool before catching up on Breaking Bad." It wasn't about being overwhelmed with school work, he would have said that. It was a clear statement about donations.

Setup an account with BitPay.com (or Coinbase.com)
You can use their free account first to try it out and if you accept BTC it's only 1% per transaction.
Also, get a tablet or phone dedicated for purchases.
The setup (once approved) is very straight forward and easy. (i.e. Pick your local currency, bank info etc.)

Last time I listened to Rogan was with AA on the show and I remember how much Rogan was kind of iffy on the subject. Now it seems hes almost defending it now. Schiff kind of comes off ~~a tad~~ very ignorant. He doesn't agree that bitcoin is still just a baby? Come on, we're still in beta! He says "everyone knows about it, the prices isn't going up" far from 'everyone' knows about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:14:44
Bitcoin.com is actually owned by a random redditor- He spoke/posted about it once looking for suggestions.. I want to say this was mid-last year sometime. I'm sure you can search around and find him, though.

I used the idea of free pizza on bitcoin pizza day to get the interest of people but I'm hoping I gave/giving a lot more than that with this post. Just like you noted, the real meaning behind this was to ask yourself what have you done with bitcoin in a positive way? To maybe take a step back and remember why you got involved to begin with. If it was passion, is it still there? Why have you lost it? etc. Or maybe this is geared more towards me and I wanted to see if anyone else was maybe in the same shoes. Either way, I hope it got some people thinking.
Let me know if you'd like a pizza, I'll be happy to send some over. I'm really glad you got the actual delivery though :)

That site is ran by GAWMiners - somewhat of a re-branding tactic after how much complaining happened when they came out as a company. So to save face, you change your name. 
Like the other guy stated, go with BITMAIN for now - if you don't want to purchase 2 units (They require 2 units minimun) we (TeamRedditMining / CoiningSolutions.com) sell single individual units. PM if you have any Qs :)

You can use the [cash deposit]( section of LocalBitcoins.com
This will allow you to physically go into a bank branch and deposit cash with a teller. (You don't need to physically meet with the seller).
Just make sure you pick a seller who is 100% rated and has over 100 trades so you will not be getting scammed.

This isn't about "doing the work yourself". Over the last year p2pool hasn't been as important as it is today and now that it is, the dev pulls this? This is a huge opportunity but he may be too blind to see it. This will hopefully spread the awareness we need, maybe there is a dev out there who is better qualified. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:41:11
I've noticed it as well. It's been a steady dogelike-incline for the last 6 months or so and we need to start being the community it once was. Positive news, people and ideas. Things just work better in a positive light so I thought I'd shed a little. Hopefully everyone can really think about my  main point of this, being reflection on yourself and the part you play (if any) in the bitcoin community and what you choose to do with that role.

~~Unable~~ Difficulty in withdrawing fiat- BTC from what I know *should* be manageable.
Without doing your own tests for science why don't you search around here and bitcointalk to find your answer. Why even risk money on something you can find out for free? I'm not sure why you're even doing this?
You can just like, read their website and answer your Qs about deposits/withdraws or just contact their support. Why are you risking money?

Maybe put some body in your OP to show this is more than a facebook-type post of "I'm bored".
Show your previous work. 
What languages are you familiar with? 
How long have you been involved with bitcoin?
Who are you?
What specifically are you looking to do? Webwork? Backend? Frontend?
Why do I even need to be asking these questions? 
These should have easily been answered in your OP when you introduced yourself, which you did not. Which already throws off a red-flag for me, personally. 
So yeah, answer the above and maybe people will take you seriously. Good luck and I hope you get some great ideas and do some good! :)

@_date: 2014-05-23 18:45:47
a) thats your personal opinion b) its just as hard as bitstamp is
If this is for personal reassurance then go right ahead, but if you're wanting to sway people per your theory/testing it will take a lot more documentation and a lot of different amounts.
I see what you're trying to do/prove, which in theory would be good. But you will have the bitcoiners saying "well about xxx amount, or to this country, or same day deposits" etc etc.
So if you're testing, might as well test everything that everyone will ask you about. :)

My count is 2, also. I agree, business is business if it makes sense. So the fact that they pulled out everyone bitcoin was associated with them was a bit odd. My paranoia wants to believe it's a high up-the-ladder decision that has some conflictions with bitcoin in general. I can't think of any other logical reason other than not wanting to be associated with bitcoin.

Independently, I do not believe so, BUT [SoftTouchPOS]( is a POS system that does integrate Bitcoin.
Now, I'm assuming you already have a POS system in place. In that case, you *should* have options for independent tip/orders and/or alternative currency for orders. Most if not all modern POS systems have this (I had worked in POS and CC processing for a loonng time).
With the above said, for every "bitcoin" transaction and/or tip you could create custom ticket/order.. which will end up being more hassle if you guys are having trouble already with tablet setup. I suggest contacting your POS company (who are they by the way, I'm familiar with a lot of them) and inquire regarding Bitcoin adoption. This accomplishes a few things at once. Awareness, answers to your Q and possible future adoption. 
A lot of merchants are actually struggling/worrying about this exact situation. It seems a lot of the bitcoin trans are "off the books" because there are so few of them.. I don't agree with their method or practices but I completely understand as a new/first time user and just wanting to keep business moving.

So LocalBitcoins but instead of starbucks to meet at , its your office.
First of all, if you have never sold bitcoins on LBC you should start. You need some first hand experience and you will answer every question you asked. Because I can tell you have little to no experience actually dealing w customers and buying/selling btc.
To sum up: No, you will not make enough to cover your costs attempting to be a B/M store that only sells BTC.
Ask any BTMs how they are doing.
My advice: learn how to sell on LBC and do not waste money on new ideas. Build your customer base.. And if you feel you can expand, then do it.

This topic will slowly lead to companies middle-manning like a bank that allows charge backs. Slowly be able to do the same fraud as people do all day with CCs. 
I still firmly believe in a no reversal system. It's not hard to check, re-check and then check again the address your sending $$ to.
If you can't do that then that is on you for not being responsible (and probably shouldn't be using Bitcoin if you cannot a couple of things before sending money). With companies like BitPay where it gives you a button to push and pay these 'mistakes' won't be happening as much. Once we get away from addresses and usability is simplified, the masses *should* come.
All the stories I read of money sent to the wrong address was always user error, never on the system itself.
Stories starting with "I was drunk last night and meant to ..." - I have no sympathy for that.
Or "I sent BTC to a previous address I had in my history and not the actual address that I needed to" - again, full user incompetence. 
If anything, I would suggest a time allowance for reversal. Say something like up to 3 minutes to prevent any funny business. Kind of how Google allows you to un-send emails.

So anyway, the idea was basically CoinMap +
* iOS and Android Apps, Built off GoogleMaps API, using defaults
* GUI would look like Google Maps/Yelp iOS App with simplicity being key
* Location services! I honestly hate having to scroll the world map on CoinMap every single time I open it. Open app, it auto locates, and shows you all nearby locations that accept btc. Boom, done!
* Merchants can create accounts via web or App - list menus/products/specials etc
* User *could* opt to create accounts to leave reviews etc
Going even farther..
* Wallet integration directly in app

You're assuming way too much.
Again, who is saying the main selling point is low transaction costs? You are. There are plenty of selling points, you just decided low transaction costs is the main one.
Now, with that even said, at a BTM you are *not* just transacting/transferring, you are purchasing bitcoin at a convenience. Do I agree with 12%? That's neither here nor there. Do I agree with fees? I damn sure do.
How much does a BTM cost?
Renters space for the location?
Maintenance? 
Who's funding the machine with coins originally?
Allllllll of that costs money. 
So to complain when people *know* there are cheaper routes is just ass backwards.
Don't like the fees? Use an Exchange. Don't like exchanges? Use LocalBitcoins. Fees too high with LocalBitcoins? Use a BTM? Still too high? Use an Exchange. 
We're just going full circle here.

A vague post will get vague answers. That may be why the first time you asked it was over-looked.
Tell us about the problems that arise when trying to increase the use in your community. Start with a specific problem(s) so we as a community can try to solve it.
It can be anything really, but a discussion definitely needs a topic before it goes somewhere.
Start with asking on ways to spread awareness or how to professionally 'pitch' to merchants w/o coming off preachy. Or anything really.
Hopefully you can add some body to the post with some specific ideas or problems and we can have a positive discussion on the future of bitcoin. 
I believe that the top posts of Bitcoin should be development, security, announcements, (actual) news.. heck, even just general posts like yours now with positive light to make a better network/currency, anything that is *progressive* to bitcoin. 
I also believe that the memes, screen shots and 1 line questions need to be suppressed by my above recommendation of positive posts that move bitcoin forward.

Create an account w cex.io
To find your cex.io deposit wallet goto finance &gt; btc &gt; deposit (it will show you your address)
Then go to settings &gt; auto-payout
Input your 2 charity addresses and select 50% on each
Now any btc deposited to your cex.io wallet address will automatically split and send to your 2 charities once a day
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:13:03
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:27:04
Yep, that's exactly how it should go down. 
If the Q/A comes off biased we already know that it will be dismissed by the GAW community specifically for that reason (ala, "troll was just trolling at the Q/A"). Or if someone/people asks questions with no substance or merit (ala, "What about always profitable? or that $20 floor?") that's not going to accomplish much. 
But if we have someone who knows how to speak, debate and has their arsenal of knowledge (97% Premine, the source code itself, amazon/target/wm, Everything up and running before 2015, dangling-carrot marketing, etc) to disprove the lies - then I'm all for it. Unfortunately, I'm not that person but I know there is a good amount of people online who are. If nobody steps up, this parade will just continue.

**"Serious Cash" - Then use a proper medium like an exchange** - don't bitch and cry about a BTM's convenience fees that you or your friend do not agree with. Your post is so meaningless. 
Why not go into and say "HEY! I was going to buy some fries when I noticed they were 1.29 and I think 1.09 is fair. You know, McDonalds, you could have so many more customers if you just dropped your prices." - Dude, they don't care. Neither does this BTM owner and neither does You have a bunch of upvotes for people listening to your rant. 
If you actually wanted to do something about this situation, you would try to contact the BTM owner at the physical location or leave a note with your contact information to discuss your issues with it. But you didn't. You came to to whine and get upvotes. "Dear BTM Owner of.." - This isn't the BTM owners forums is it? You want action? DO SOMETHING.

The thing about that is, the people who *know* how to pick apart the whole GAW ordeal most likely *won't* be at that conference asking him questions. So this whole thing with GAW/Josh will just continue as "business as usual" after all said and done.
The online community who is great with proving scams and lies etc. are only that: online. 
The people who hate Josh/GAW/Pay so much are the ones who need to be at the conference. They put countless hours and effort into proving this company/person being a scam yet do nothing more than type, which is great, but only goes so far. 
Imagine the video of the conference where Josh is open to Q/A and is addressed to answer all of his "lies" and gets stumped or called out by someone who knows their stuff. I believe *that* would make a bigger impact than all of these posts on reddit and bitcointalk, unfortunately. 
Sure, the MtGox people went "real life" once everything was said and done and all BTC was gone. But, think about the BFL situation. People sat online calling out BFL/Josh, threatening him etc. and all he did was literally laugh and mock his customers/users because he knew they weren't going to do anything (at the time, yes I'm aware of the BK).
Talk is talk and actions are actions. While I applaud the internet detectives, unless something real is done, nothing will be.
**tldr;** The heavy hater typists of GAW/Josh are the ones who need to be at the conference bringing all of the this "scamming" to light in a Q/A form.

Their web GUI seems to be glitchy ( I select a setting, it doesn't save or execute- You have to reboot multiple times to have a setting stay).

Few things:
1. Customer Support users (chat) and floor managers (the person the tech spoke with) have no idea what goes on behind the scenes as far as business relationships. If they are still working out the final details there would be no way of customer support knowing this
2. There was talk of GAW/PayCoin just using Amazons API (to which there is no direct relationship), again, meaning chat support would be clueless
3. I may have missed this but when did they say "Amazon officially endorses us."  - because all that is going to do is discredit you for saying that towards the chat support
A better approach could be:
A third party company is claiming to support purchases through their own website. Is there a verified list of companies who use your APIs?
Also, do you have any relationship with PayBase or PayCoin as far as first or second hand?
Additionally, is it possible that Amazon and PayBase may be working on a deal that you or tier 1 support may be unaware of?

I claimed they would close all of his accounts *at that bank* not at a different bank sorry if that was confusing (even though he says "not be the account rather than not be bank" like you're assuming). Either way, the bottom line is if they close it - then that bank will no longer deal with you. You'll open up another bank account at another bank and the same will happen again until you are on the list that all banks run the check on and the you will no longer be allowed to open up accounts. My main point originally was to not assume that opening another checking account (whether the same bank or another) is not a long term solution for this problem.

This isn't really the best recommendation. This singles out all of your Bitcoin related banking into 1 lovely and easily readable checking account for your Bank to close due to activity related to bitcoin. 
So when your bank/CU checks this 'new' account , all it will see is Coinbase.com Circle.com etc. - which will flag anyone who looks at your banking information (the bank).
It's happened before and will happen again. Just a heads up.

Pretty much every idea you have here has been in my head for over a year. I've tried asking for help on creating a new and better CoinMaps - using google maps API , Android + iOS devices, simple GPS and GUI. Nothing ever gets done w/o a good dev.
In a nutshell: I was thinking the Yelp app but Bitcoin B&amp;M/Services
I'm not a dev so I have no idea how easy/hard it is - but I think a universal app for both Android and iOS (And allows an integration for wallets) is a home run.
I do know what people want as far as GUI and functionality but dev skills are just something I, unfortunately, never go into.
Any devs want to take this on? Let's work together!

Yes, I'm all for not buying from scammers. Hence for the 3rd time, 'do your due diligence'. We've been selling Trezors for quite some time now along with other hardware and services. I understand the point you're trying to make but I don't think you're understanding mine when I'm saying there are reputable resellers (although SL do not offer official reseller agreements they offer reselling, affiliation - Speak to Alena at SL if you have doubts).
And also, the website they are calling out is is copy-cat site of their OFFICIAL website... trying to scam people and trick them into thinking it's SatoshiLabs / BuyTrezor.

Sadly, I feel the operator and/or location should be fully trained on the BTMs and that doesn't seem to be the case.
Worst case I'd think they would put a contact number or email on the machines for emergencies which seems to not happen either. 
It's bad business practice in general.. not sure why they would invest in a BTM and then not maintain it.

I didn't say it was cheap or effective. The question was **easiest**.

I personally would go with Bitmain over Spondoolies (nothing against them) but Bitmain is just a step ahead in the game. Units are cheaper, stable, and quieter. 
Anyway, I did a short video earlier in the month regarding my data center and KnCMiner Titans but there's a short spot where you can see some AntMiner S3s running if you'd like [here]( We've got about ~60 units currently and you can get an idea of the noise.

What are your current core-clock and memory-clock settings in MSI AF? 
* You want to turn the memory-clock as low as it goes. This will help with lowering your temps. The memory-clock does *not* affect the hashing rate.
* Your core-clock you want at about 90% it's max rate.
Do what I said above, check your rates, and then play with the clock settings in MSI AF to really dial it in.
And again, what mining software are you using? This will be the factor that may squeeze out the extra Mhps you're looking for.

9/10 use the MtGox API and this doesn't seem to.
Your app shows me $107.6USD/BTC but Clarkmood, bitcoinity, mtgox all show $112. So for how much I would love to use this, if it's not matching everything else though- literally the deal breaker.
Any thoughts?

For bitcoins sake I hope the ladder. Since bitcoin's whole purpose is to get it out of the hands of companies and into the owner/user I would assume it's going to be *us* who decides what escrow services we use and which ones fall at the wayside.
If there is a bad service then people will look for better pastures. 
But who will step up and make the escrow service that is solid? That's the question isn't it? Again, all I can hope is that someone who is fit for that part steps up and does the community right.

It's been like 2 months, man. Can you honestly just not wait a few more to see what happens? I don't know your $$$ situation so if you need the money cash out.

they are shady for sure. they used to have such quick turn around. now its like 5 days and they false advertise their payout amounts. they change something about their service almost everyday, so if you do not continue to keep an eye out you may get snaked.

Unfortunately there isn't anything MtGox can/will do. There is NO way of knowing it was an actual hacker and not you, you know?
You have to look at it like this- what is stopping you from trying to scam MtGox (or whomever) pretending to "steal" your coins?
What's stopping you from telling your friend in Nevada to log into your account, transfer coins into HIS wallet? This is the EXACT reason that you will NOT get your coins back. Sorry bud- but it's for security purposes. You just learned a 30 BTC lesson.

Give me a ballpark of how many trades per day you're looking at.
If it's a small amount of back and forth- Coinbase.com is always good
If you want a more in depth market table I would suggest CampBX.. but nevermind.. because Dwolla was the only easy way to get USD in/out of an exchange for us in US.
Bitstamp is EU.. you would need to wire transfer your USD out..
Looks like the easiest way may be Coinbase, but that's limited on it's own.

@_date: 2013-10-12 00:10:28
Again, you're not understanding how it works. Localbitcoins does not "have a price" its merely a website that posts ads for people selling them. The API that localbitcoins is providing is not "an average number" but nothing more than showing you the price of the LAST sale on their website. Which is going to confuse people even more on how localbitcoins works..
It's nice they offer an API showing the last price a coin sold/bought for.. but it may do more damage than good.. until people understand the figure that is being displayed.
**edit:** [this chart]( will make it easier to look at/understand what I mean by the "last price" is the USD shown

It's not easy to get USD into your account on the basic trading sites now (CampBX, BitStamp), since they dropped all Dwolla support etc.

You've got something confused.
You purchase bitcoins via Western Union on LocalBitcoins (I suggest/prefer you do a cash deposit via Bank and only with a high rated seller). Once the seller receives your payment he/she will then send/release your bitcoins into your LocalBitcoins.com wallet.
From there you have access to your online wallet which will have your bitcoins.

If you use a companies services to run a website.. why would you NOT do everything you can to verify your account status with Coinbase?
Other than coinbases delayed purchases/sells (I am now level 2 verified so thats not an issue anymore) I have never had a problem with coinbase, ever. 
I'm not saying that since you are not verified you are now seeing issues BUT I will say if you WERE verified- that would be 1 less possible problem.
Now what I'm going to assume is you're a limited user and THAT is causing your delays and issues- not coinbase.
@_date: 2013-06-08 15:51:18

@_date: 2013-10-21 14:17:38
The *easiest* way to buy coins is still to do a [**cash deposit**]( purchase via [LocalBitcoins.com](
Look for a green light, 100% rating, at least 30+ trans and a bank that is near local with a quick/instant release.

Anyway to get the bitcoin name out there (in a positive way) is all good in my book. I literally bring up bitcoin with everyone and anyone I feel can benefit from it (so everyone).
I setup paper wallets for friends/family .. give them a bit of coin to hold onto. I also try to get friends/family/enthusiasts who want to invest a safe place to do so over at and CoiningSolutions.com
Still working on my pitch'n skills to promote accepting bitcoin for merchants but seem to be doing pretty good in my local area.

You probably didn't do it the right way.
You should ONLY do Cash Deposit &gt; MtGox Account.
Do not do to paypal, do not use to e-mail, do not use to bitcoin address. DIRECTLY TO YOUR MTGOX.

Why do people address the reddit community as if we are the company you're trying to complain about.
How about you relay these issues to them directly?
@_date: 2013-05-13 14:35:12
As far as shares, they are the only company.
Either way, I would advise against buying shares with AM.

And the purpose of that would be what? They just told you that they were going to resolve it for you- case closed. No need to have such a dramatic title when they clearly noticed the issue and are working to resolve per your email. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:17:47
I literally just used this earlier as an example comparing how governments will never shut down bitcoin just like how ThePirateBay seems to never be shutdown (permanently). With currency being involved I doubt it would even get that close to being shutdown.

Assuming you're a Windows guy.. a laptop would be a solid way to run it. Low heat/power compared to your desktop.
I wouldn't suggest going into a raspberry pi, why add more headache to your mix? The goal is to get mining and efficiently. So unless you know how to tweak linux just avoid that and stick with what you know!
Also, mind if I ask the day you placed our order for a 25? I want to shoot BFL an e-mail and see if they have a rough ETA for orders placed today- I know months but hoping a more specific number since their announcement.

Oh man, I *really* wish I was an early adopter, who know's what I would have been able to accomplish.. but anyway..
I started to mine about 4 months ago when I had first found out about bitcoin. I was immediately addicted so I created to get a team going and making it a bit more 'fun' than the average mining.
Shortly after I put a ton of my own $ up and bought a KnCMiner Saturn.. then an hour later I thought I had made a huge mistake so I started to sell off shares or parts of the miner to help me pay for it.. I then turned that into a full blown Group Buy to which I created [CoiningSolutions.com]( and have been doing GBs for both KnCMiner and HashFast. Currently we're at the hashrate I stated above but if more miners keep moving like hotcakes, who knows.
Feel free to check us out at - friendly community of mainly GPU miners but as ASICs are coming online most of the subscribers are shareholders. Either way- I'm always there if you have any Qs that the general bitcoin community may bury or not address.
Happy mining.

Yes, your post is moot. What does complaining here do? Absolutely nothing.
On top of that I do not believe you when you say you had lost money. You lost so much money that instead of contacting CampBX you took a screen shot of a website that was down for a few minutes to post it here? Makes no sense. I wouldn't give 2 shits about reddit karma- I would be all over CampBX.
@_date: 2013-10-13 20:43:25
Oops, sorry, seller*
Again, this can allll be avoided following my first reply...


If communication is shotty- I say DONT risk it.
I recommend doing it at a Starbucks or Bank (Somewhere public and with wifi) - verify coins in your online wallet before letting the seller leave.

Until we hit 21M.


Not entirely.. Mining is what is actually securing the networking and that is what confirms your bitcoin transactions.
If you have 5 Bitcoins and you just sit on them for 10 years- you still have 5 bitcoins 10 years later.
If you take 5 bitcoins and invest into miners- in 10 Years you could have hundreds of coins. See the point I'm making?

*Easiest* would be Coinbase but they seem to make their limits shittier by the week.
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:15:36
And I will have to instantly disagree with you.
Contact a buyer who does cash deposit at any major bank. (BofA, Wells Fargo, Chase, Citibank, etc. etc.)
You message him- he gives you his bank account number. You deposit cash into his account- you mark it paid via your smartphone- he releases coins. INSTANT. How is it instant? Because the coins are already in escrow when you contact the buyer, there is no "waiting" for confirmation.
How do I know? I sell coins all day across the nation this way.
Maybe try the way I stated above?
edit: I will note that Coinbase is getting knocked down points for 2 reasons. 1. He's not Level 2 verified. That will take the guy a month. 2. He has a daily limit - Localbitcoins does not.

I started to consider that point "what if exchanges were closed" but honestly, I cannot see every.single.country. working all together at the same time to shut all of them down.
My best example (although not dealing with currency) is ThePirateBay
There will always be a new spring of exchanges if that were to ever happen (them being shut down everywhere).
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:32:08

Yeah, I was always posting to the sub but then I started getting investors from reddit, email, bitcointalk, in person etc. So I needed a more centralized spot for everyone to keep up. Came up with some witty (at least I think is lol) name and the rest is history.

Go to withdrawal in MtGox and select "Bitcoin" as the option.
From there, enter in YOUR campbx address and the amount you want to send. 
Hit confirm and wait about an hour or two before you see it.
Hope that helps.

Again, anyone with what I said above. 100% rating, and at least a 30+ transaction history and you'll be fine.
Some sellers require a lot of information (Your name, location etc.) Some sellers just want the cash deposited and verified. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 16:50:06

So I believe it says 4 days for a Level 1 user- I do not believe this includes ACH transfer time. (2-3 days).
You sent it Sunday- which means they probably started processing it on Monday. So from Monday expect 4 days + ACH time. We're on day 4 since then.
Even if you get verified and are instant later- You can buy coins instant but again- it will still take 2-3 days (sometimes next day if you're lucky) to get that $ into your bank.

Day to day speculation .. is just that.. speculation. Once you stop paying so much attention to the USB/BTC it's easier to sit back and take it all in. At least that's how I am. Every 10 minutes I would say "ooOOOhh look at that 1 dollar change!!!" then I shortly realized how much wasted effort it was starring at that damn ticker.

There are also no indications showing that KnC is NOT prepared to ship.. also, no, they wouldn't. Because KnC is not a showboating company. They (seem) professional and about their business.

If you aren't going to use mtgox try bitstamp and campbx.

ONLY deal with people with 100% feedback.
If communication is shotty- I say DONT risk it.
I recommend doing it at a Starbucks or Bank (Somewhere public and with wifi) - verify coins in your online wallet before letting the seller leave.
@_date: 2013-07-12 22:57:48
I haven't been doing any day trading so I haven't had to use CampBX's slow ass site lately but I feel your pain. I actually use MtGox over them if I do- but I buy all my coins through coinbase. Coinbase all day baby.

Yeah, running them caseless with the fan mod.
I'm debating going back to .96 -  I think I'll let them run another 12hrs then possibly switch them over and compare.
Ha, I wish I was one of the lucky ones with a 550+ machine :P
@_date: 2013-09-27 11:38:34


What you fail to realize is that just because they haven't *shown* you anything does not mean they do *not* have it done on their end.
I guess we'll just have to wait until Oct 15, right?
@_date: 2013-07-11 00:12:37
CampBX is ok, they're my default. Their website is so slow though- it gets frustrating after a while.
I will still use Gox if I'm doing heavy trading. Then shoot it over to an offline or CBX.
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:09:34
When/if they "cancel" the transactions, you can e-mail them and they will push the transaction through for you (with the same amount and everything).
CB is working on their CS- with that said, I believe CB visits frequently in and resolves customer issues as well. They love us.
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:42:21
I want to say it's a lot better than the laptop that you take around everywhere. I keep some of my coins there but have them scattered about. Mainly in an offline wallet.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:53:43
I'm aware of your options. I recommend what I see people NOT complaining about here on reddit and on forums.

They clearly state on their website "Orders placed today WILL be delivered in October."
Of course take that with a grain of salt but I do not believe KnC is anything like BFL with their "2 more weeks" BS.

I can say I have honestly thought about the ability of controlling difficulty via large percentage of computer power. Obviously that's a LOT of power so we're talking big companies.. but the possibility of manipulating the system is definitely there.


Spot on.
Other thoughts I have is all of this ASIC hardware that will be useless (?) in the years to come. If these new units are build to do one thing and one thing only (mine) what's going to happen to all of the hardware? Will they be the new CRT monitors? The dial-up modems?

This may be something you will have to work with coinbase on- see if they even allow that option. If not- you may have to do the leg work on your own and manually add the user/pw to a copy of the receipt.

Explain to me how they are physically stopping you from mining? From using bitcoin-qt on your computer? From spending your bitcoins on goods and services?

I'll be able to provide live Miner stats because of the "Team" feature that BTCG offers. A big plus to provide transparency in regards to a miners uptime/hashrate/earnings etc.
I like their website and layout.. And again the features they offer.
Nothing is in stone as of yet and of course I will always make what I feel is the best decision for the GB.
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:37:19
Well, not much will change from today/tomorrow. So if you feel the news announcement tomorrow will greatly affect the USD price then you might as well wait a couple days to buy in (or not).
I've purchased coins at almost every price point (not a smart move) but as long as you spend them correctly or sell them for more than you will still be ok.

Don't. Buy. GPUs.
Go through this whole subreddit if you need links telling you why NOT TO BUY THEM.
Almost any and every GPU you buy right now will take OVER 1 YEAR to return it's investment. If you're fine with that, then do it.
Best bet now is get in a group buy for AVALON Chips or buy BitCoin straight out.

Over the past few days everyone who has requested shipment via UPS have had their address details confirmed and altered where needed. We still have many customers who have provided incorrect VAT details and we are contacting everyone affected by this, if you are not a registered company with real VAT number, you will have to pay VAT at the relevant rate.
We know that everyone is keen to see more photos and videos of the products and production so we will be releasing our launch video in the coming days. Look out for more news as it happens!

I always say that the technology side of Bitcoin isn't always a 'need to know' basis just like you are saying with the example above.
I have so many people in RL asking about how they can use BTC to move money to family overseas etc. and at this point I can't really recommend a friendly and easy way to do so (to people w/ no clue on BTC).
Someone will def start a company doing exactly this. Wish I had the know-how to do it myself. 8)

Now *that* is a block of text.
It's not going to be a "right person". There is no one person who is going to do this. PEOPLE are already doing this. I am and you should (if you know what you are talking about) as well.
You will not force anyone to do anything, they will find it on their own whether they like it or not. If they were not proactive enough to watch what's going on in the world around them, that's on them and NOT "us" or the "right guy" to tell them about it.

You might be mistaking them for being an "exchange" which they are not.
When you see the price of localbitcoins on the charts it's not a RATE it's just showing you the last price that coins were bought/sold for. Look at he rest of the chart, the prices are all over. Again, do not use this as a "rate" - it is simply a listing of sales.
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:38:26
Again, this is why I don't use CampBX.
From a post a few days ago it looks like they have changed their policies regarding Dwolla &gt; CampBX. People were saying the times went from 3 days to 10 days transfer? But something like that has changed recently so most likely that's why your money is now taking so long.

My opinion is the exact opposite of yours in regards to BFL. How can you honestly say that if you placed an order today with both companies you would get a little single first? Are you not aware of the 
60,000+ preorders they have to catch up on PRIOR to getting to your order placed today? KnC does not have that issue and I'm aware they haven't produced anything.

The price of bitcoin isn't the only thing about the virtual currency that is going through the roof.
Mining costs, industry parlance for the investments in sophisticated technology required to create bitcoin, are soaring as companies and people race to build ever-more-powerful computers to jump into the market.
In the mining process, bitcoin enthusiasts, technology experts and fledgling firms essentially generate units of the currency by solving complicated math problems with their computers.
The growing popularity and rising prices of bitcoin are causing a mad dash for the powerful computing power needed to generate the virtual currency, leading to profit pressure for companies and individual enthusiasts working to create their own stashes.
The speed at which such operations take place is now 40 times faster than in January, according to the Genesis Block, a New York research and data firm that tracks the bitcoin industry. In addition, hardware companies are hustling to keep up with orders for new equipment.
"The dollars that have been invested in this space are being reinvested into computational power," says Greg Schvey , head of research at the company.
There is a finite supply of 21 million bitcoin that can be created. There are roughly 12 million currently in existence.
The furor surrounding bitcoin production was referenced last week in a lawsuit filed against two bitcoin companies in which a New York-based investment firm contends bitcoin startup CoinLab Inc. and its mining unit violated a bitcoin-production contract.
The suit, filed by Bitvestment Partners LLC, contends that CoinLab reneged on a pact to produce nearly 8,000 bitcoin.
The lawsuit was a contributing factor in last week's bankruptcy filing of the CoinLab mining unit, Alydian Inc.
"Due to the lawsuit and the dramatic increase in mining speed in the Bitcoin network (lowering returns for all Bitcoin miners, including Alydian), Alydian felt that its duty was to ensure that Alydian's customers, creditors and investors maximize their possible returns through Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection," Peter Vessenes , CoinLab's chief executive, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. He said the lawsuit was baseless.
A lawyer representing Bitvestment declined to comment on Mr. Vessenes's statement. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. district court for the New York's Southern district.
The lawsuit and bankruptcy are the latest scramble around bitcoin, a fast-growing virtual currency that has seen roller-coaster trading and fueled a modern-day gold rush.
Bitcoin's increased popularity also has brought more scrutiny. A pair of Senate committees will hold hearings on the policy issues raised by virtual currencies in the coming weeks, according to Senate aides, a development that comes amid growing attention from government regulators on digital forms of money.
Bitcoin is a four-year-old virtual currency that isn't backed by a central bank and can be traded on a number of exchanges or swapped privately. A growing number of merchants also accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services, because the transaction costs associated with the currency are generally cheaper than those with credit cards or debit cards.
Bitcoin traded at record highs Tuesday, rising to $252.61 on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange. That gives those 8,000 disputed bitcoin a value of roughly $2 million.
But the rising prices have brought an increased push by so-called miners to use the speediest computers to get more bitcoin.
"There is an arms race for customized hardware that is more and more powerful and can process transactions faster and faster. But it is making it difficult to get a return on investment," says Jeremy Allaire , a technology entrepreneur who last week announced a new bitcoin-related company that received $9 million in venture-capital funding.
The power and speed at which the computers attempt to solve the problems and accumulate more bitcoin is measured in the so-called hashrate. Recently, the measure has soared and is now tracked in "petahash," bitcoin experts say.
Alydian's bankruptcy filing surprised many observers, because CoinLab is one of the best-known names in the virtual-currency industry, describing itself as a "bitcoin business incubator." Silicon Valley's venture-capital firm Draper Associates pumped $500,000 into CoinLab last year.
Mr. Vessenes also is the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit trade group that promotes the use of bitcoin.
The process of producing bitcoin is being further complicated by arrangements in which some mining companies essentially agreed to sell bitcoin to investors in exchange for cash to fund equipment needs, according to people who track the industry. With bitcoin prices rising, it is now more expensive for the miners to deliver that currency to their investors.
"Mining has gotten hypercompetitive very quickly," says Alex Ferrara, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, who is assessing investment opportunities in the bitcoin industry.

This is a service/idea that other redditors/bitcoin people have been discussing. I can't remember the convo exactly.. but it was maybe about a month ago. Long story short- we spoke about using the bitcoin technology but having customers not need know what it is. I.e. I want to buy this item/service/good from this person- A service would be the middle man who takes a standard payment (CC,ACH etc) converts it to BTC- sends to Merchant and the merchant can either have an auto-exchange or simply accept the bitcoins as is.
I wish I had enough back-end web experience so I could code exactly what I'm saying/seeing. 
**tl;dr** Company X processes credit card/debit card/ach purchase a standard payment on customers end. , gets receipt, etc.
Behind the scenes: Company X takes the purchase type (CC,Debit,ACH) exchanges for BTC and sends to Merchant
Merchant can either accept bitcoins from Company X or have auto-exhange to USD for a fee. etc.

I'd rather do first-hand experience than form an opinion based on upvotes/downvotes. So it's good you'll dabble with them both.
@_date: 2013-07-27 15:24:36
Lol, exactly. At this point either purchase BTC outright or invest in ASIC mining if you like payouts.

**edit:** If you don't want to go all in on a miner, I'm selling shares over in :)
@_date: 2013-07-27 12:36:10
It's not that Coinbase/BTCE/CampBX/BitStamp are behind, it's that MtGox is assumed the default (which it shouldn't be) and people base the USD rate off of that.
I now just use the average of the other exchanges listed above to figure out my "fair price". If you bought your coins on coinbase you have to remember that you most likely purchased them at a lower rate than MtGox as well- so consider that in your profit margin when doing your numbers.
I would suggest to NOT think of MtGox as the USD rate.
I like to use the [BitPay]( exchange rate.

Would probably help if there was something in that subreddit explaining what LEETCOIN is.
Also would help adding a site , if you have one?
**edit:** I'm more than aware of what leetcoin is- I was doing it for the sake of information everyone else who does not know. You kind of made a post saying "Hey, Bitcoins and Counter-Strike and tournys!" .. Everyones face is: "Uh, what?"
So my advice is to make a post explaining who and what you are and what you do (service) then follow up with your enthusiasm to get this going. :)

This shouldn't even need to be said, but MtGox should be the default. (Not that I agree with that) but this little bit of code is going to determine if you app takes off or not in the iOS/Android community. 
It really is designed well so I do not want to see this left in the dust.
* MtGox should always be the default for BTC/USD
* Add the option to select what exchange API you get data from (ie btc e, campbx, etc etc)
* Offer *every* option you can -but always keep the front end sleek/clean/minimal (like you did)
* I really like the swipe gesture per screen
* Let's add Alerts! (If below X, if more than X) Boom- pops up in notification center.
* What about adding a **live** update (Maybe offer a small checkbox on the screen) Something like: Live(  ).
So you would then tap that button and then data would begin to stream live- as opposed to click/swipe to refresh

The average bitcoin'r isn't a "thousandaire" and I think your design is geared towards people with more $$.
You want to be successful? You need a product under $50- why would someone pay even that much when they do not own that much BTC?
My best way to put it is this: You're trying to make a Gucci wallet for people who have less than $100 to fill that wallet with. Unless your demographic is higher end bitcoin users this idea will fail. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:28:43
I understand where you're coming from but remember your early stages of bitcoin? You're not going to change human behavior- to the bitcoin n00bs this is all new and it's changing fast- so they react.

I've heard of people not releasing the coins when they say they did..  What I said above is just what you should be doing for every transaction anyway. People tend to make it so much more than it is.
You give him cash, he pushes release, you verify coins are in your wallet. It's literally that simple.

BTCGuild sells them for cheap, so I suggest checking them out.
Now I feel like I have to say this, but have you looked into Group Buy shares? i.e. You purchase a share of a commercial miner and get paid dividends? I run and I have a couple group buys going if you're interested in going that route.

I understand what goes into R&amp;D and the point you're making but my gripe is the fact that they did the whole big announcement thing but NOTHING has changed. What was the point of the mass e-mailer and updates and all the attention if everyone is STILL in the dark about their orders? It was clearly a marketing tactic to hype themselves up again. Out of those 10s of thousands of pre-orders, why have we NOT seen 1 post from someone saying "I logged in and seen the status of my unit being shipped?". Well, exactly. If the company wasn't going to provide shipping details- DONT ANNOUNCE YOU ARE SHIPPING.

Anyway, I easily trade off 0.05% for the ability to deposit with over 10 different ways (with cash deposits with bitinstant that are instant) - over 5 ways to withdraw funds (back and forth with dwolla 0 fees sending, 25cents receiving).. a better website, most active exchange and a very nice API.
So yeah, to each their own.

I agree with Bitcoins being risky and shares being more risky. Why? Bitcoin investment is merely watching the USD price. Stock investment is hoping for the ROI whilst also watching the USD.

Yeah, how about you try using it once and answer your own questions.
Localbitcoins is a whole system- You make an account.. you post an AD which is LOGGED into THEIR website. When you finish a sale you mark it COMPLETE.

Oh my bad, tones are hard to read online! The whole MtGox situation is a real PITA- I hope we can get all exchanges within +/- $1

They aren't ignoring you, they are backed up.

Congrats! There's a never ending supply of reading material regarding bitcoin!

Great thanks

This is a half-a post.
Are you a level 1 user, or level 2 verified? Instant?
Have you made a transaction before? What day did you do this on? What day did it tell you it would arrive per the popup? Is it later than the date it specified.
Please do more than make a post to bash a small problem.
@_date: 2013-05-24 20:48:07
No thanks. 
Giving away free coins to get people to play, and then getting them to put their own BTC in when they run out of free coins is a great way to ~~deceive~~ market your company. Good luck with everything.
@_date: 2013-05-07 22:49:16
Awesome. You should post this in @_date: 2013-08-23 21:14:48
KnCMiner, HashFast, Cointerra
I actually have group buys for all 3 of them over in ;)
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:36:22
I don't expect jack shit from you, lol. I'm just telling you how and what it is. Sheep all you want. :)
And at the end of the day, it is the people who still look at that MtGox price that keep driving it up, so refer to it all you want.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:10:06
As I look over at it hitting $92.. lol ouch!

Do your due diligence.
Yeah, ASICminer is what you want. Lol. 4BTC a share with .02 dividends.
@_date: 2013-05-24 17:17:45
Spot on! Along with any other location for transportation (Trains, Ships)
@_date: 2013-08-26 20:30:37
Coinbase and Localbitcoins are your friends! KnC looks like theyre doing good things so hopefully they come through!

Localbitcoins.com is always fast/easy + you can sometimes get a bit more $ out of it :)
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:11:06
Yeah, that's as far as I get. I'm just looking for something more definite. They say they are shipping, they know what they can produce and they know how many orders they have. They CAN give a realistic time-frame of delivery. So the fact that the 2-3 month answer is still given still has me shrugging at BFL.

Look for a green light, 100% rating, at least 30+ trans and a bank that is near local with a quick/instant release.

All fine over here.

We've got a group buy going for HashFast over at , Join in if you guys like :)
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:57:26
I understand, I'm just suggesting spending them rather than selling them.
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:53:35
Awesome! I'll give this a watch later today.

Well, whatever it is, it's working for him.

I like the idea of Bitcoin without Bitcoin. Not having to explain it to the customers and just taking advantage of the technology. Good read, thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:47:54
Annnnnd there's your mistake.


@_date: 2013-05-05 19:05:51
You cannot cancel or refund a transaction. Whoever you sent them to will have to manually send you back the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-12 23:03:23
I agree! And now they offer instant purchase of coins, which is just icing on the cake. Killer.

* You can cancel your order with BFL, just contact office
* With the $300 you'll get back you can either buy BTC and have that in-hand and *now* or spend $300 on hardware that will take a year to earn back the investment

Then I guess I wasn't able to read between the lines enough. I'm more blunt. If he specifically wan'ted to "Understand that the client is open-source and anyone is free to create" then maybe he should of said "Hey, is the client open source software and is anyone free to create one?" .... no?
@_date: 2013-05-12 04:08:18
Need to adjust the font color.
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:08:42
Me too, because they do not state that.
They state: Shipping **begins** in September.
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:59:23
Since he didn't explain why.. You don't want to do this because locations like those save images to their systems. Although 9/10 people wouldn't know what you were printing there is still a digital copy somewhere and you never know what people will do with that.
At this point I would suggest writing it down or waiting to you visit a family members/close friends home.
@_date: 2013-09-25 14:44:08
Now I am.. madness!
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:04:53
Hit or miss? Not sure what you mean by that.. but I want to say no. There are **always** people selling bitcoins, so it's not hit or miss.
You can have coins within 5mins of depositing cash, anonymously. If you find a seller you like, stick with him and buy whenever you want with a trusted person.
Just make sure to follow the steps above.
