I had just convinced my wife Bitcoin and Crypto was real and not Monopoly money. And now she’s all over me on how right she was originally. Once this shit hits 30K I’m buying myself a Tesla and just driving it home without even telling her.
Hrmhmmm maybe a little less dramatic then that.

Haha its already pretty high now. And I'm going to cash some out to make you lives better now and keep a bunch in so we can be millionaires later.

So my story:

I got 100$ from my grandma years ago for Christmas. Really wanted to put it into Bitcoin, but my gf at the time was furiously against it. Anyways I ended up doing it, told her I spent it on the casino. Also got into gpu mining when it was still profitable so ive got a sizeable stash. I'm thinking its a good time to withdraw some (not much) and pay down some debts.

I know I could go with the classic, I told you so. But I'm more interesting in like a marching band. Hoping to hear some cool and or evil ideas muhahaha.

Yes, that's something that I am so going to bring up. She might also think I'm making it up and really I won that day.

Haha no she hasn't noticed. We have two kids and I handle the bills and she keeps every other part of our life together. She's going to be happy, I'm just looking for a fun way to tell her. And similar experience stories haha.

Edit: Yea she threatened breaking up. Probably not serious. We were young and stupid then haha.
