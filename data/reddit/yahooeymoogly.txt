What is the effect of the blockchain growing in size? Isn't it somewhere around 200GB now, and is there ever a point where the size of the full blockchain will have an effect on the number of active nodes and time to confirm a transaction?

Well, I dropped acid in college and now I'm into Bitcoin so there's some anecdotal evidence for you. 
LSD means something different now from what it did in the 60s. The 60s' psychedelic movement was more meaningful. Nowadays it's more of a fashion statement. It's mostly hipsters that drop acid now, and they don't really stand for anything except for some sort of vague ironic liberalism.
There will always be various non-violent resistance movements when intelligent, caring people wake up and see the hypocrisy, lies, and brutality of the Western world. Bitcoin or something like it may end up freeing the nations of the world from the cycle of debt slavery and meaningless war, or at least giving the everyday human being an escape hatch from the economic world (dis)order.

Sorry, but I'm clueless on all things finance- can you please explain, what's the benefit of investing in Bitcoin that way if you never actually own any Bitcoin? If you want to invest in Bitcoin, why not just buy Bitcoin?

If a Bitcoin ETF is approved, can you withdraw BTC from it or only USD?
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:56:29
I'm totally new to BTC and figure, you have to buy sometime if you want in.
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:30:28
I was weirded out at first like you, but when I realized they only do that for KYC/AML reasons.
For me personally the pros of being able to buy/sell BTC easily with low fees outweigh the risk of sending my DL over the wire. I have no credit and will probably never apply for a bank loan or even a credit card (for personal / philosophical reasons). And anyway it's not like they have my SSN.

I'm currently setting up a full node for the first time too. I'm a software developer so I'm having a lot of fun playing with bitcoin-cli and discovering its powers and limitations. But I'm pruning so it's taking a loooooong time.
Next step for me will be to spend some Bitcoin without exposing my private key to any third party (by creating, signing, and broadcasting my own transaction!)
Edit: Oh, and about your error - what does it say in the log file?
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:09:18
How could they attack / make it non-functional?
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:47:09
Ah. So the transaction itself does not contain the origin, but the service can be inferred by tracing the inputs back. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:18:43
I find it significant that they created their own blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:32:21
I've heard there is a deadline for the block size brouhaha to be resolved. Can someone explain to me why and how such a deadline exists?

How can miners identify the origin of a transaction?
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:41:07
The key things to understand are that Bitcoin has no risk of inflation and is protected by cryptography. For many forms of fiat, this is not true. 
This block size debate is more heat than light as they say. If SHA-256 collisions become trivial, then I'll be worried. If the block reward changes off-schedule, I'll be worried. Right now? Not worried.

Mycelium follows the BIP44 standard, so if worst comes to worst, you can regenerate the private key yourself.
In Ruby you can do this with the following script:
    require 'bip_mnemonic'
    require 'money-tree'
    k = 0
    mnemonic = "your mnemonic"
    seed = BipMnemonic.to_seed(mnemonic: mnemonic)
    master = MoneyTree::Master.new(seed_hex: seed)
    node = master.node_for_path("m/44p/0p/0p/0/
    puts node.to_address
    puts node.private_key.to_wif
"k" will be the index of the receiving address, and if you don't know it you can just try different values of k until you find it.
It's good that they don't allow re-using an address for security reasons, but it's unfortunate that they don't have a workflow for recovering funds accidentally sent to the same key. HTH

There has actually been a lot of inflation but in the USA inflation only affects the price of certain things like real estate, education, health care, etc.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:32:32
I don't get how this makes mining on the minority chain unprofitable. If they flood the network with "re-org" transactions (assuming that means just moving a lot of coin around) won't the fees will go sky-high too, meaning minority chain miners will make more?
Also, if their superior hash power is concentrated on the majority chain, then won't the difficulty on the minority chain come back down making mining even more profitable for regular people?

If Friday goes by and you don't have your BTC just post a message to and someone from Coinbase may see it.
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:23:38
Having their own blockchain doesn't seem immediately useful given what little I know about it. I downloaded the Mobi app and it is a cool idea. I hope it takes off.
Only thing I can think of is that if they're expecting their network to become bigger / more usable than Bitcoin itself, they would want to provide all features of Bitcoin independently one day.
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:13:50
Yeah, if it's still running it's probably no big deal. 
My node is still verifying- it's been 11 days and I'm up to late October of 2016 on the blockchain (79%). It's very slow, but I am using 10-year-old hardware.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:48:33
Makes sense to me
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:41:59
Finally up to 100%, pruning at 550 blocks. With my AMD Athlon 64 and 2GB of RAM on Ubuntu 16 it took 18 days (I shut it off nightly so I can have my peace &amp; quiet). 
I managed to import my Mycelium wallet into my node and send 0.005 to my Coinbase account, setting the fee at 0.0018 BTC/Kb. It put the change in a reserve address that `bitcoin-cli` seems to have chosen from the middle of my wallet (?). 63 confirmations now and the funds are confirmed in Coinbase.
Edit: Another note about my setup: I found out pretty quickly that my 5-year-old SSD was too flaky to use for blockchain storage, even with pruning on. So I bought a cheapo internal HDD from Newegg and installed it specifically for my Bitcoin data. I mounted it as a second drive with the SSD running the OS.
@_date: 2017-04-19 12:46:00
So, the Bitcoin blockchain.

1. It used to be free software you run on regular computers, but now it's special hardware you have to buy, and it's not cheap.
2. Open source software is a huge topic, but generally speaking the way it works on Github is that people submit changes via pull requests, and those with commit rights can merge the pull requests after it passes their review.
3. Users set the fee they intend to pay when they make a transaction, but miners have control over which transactions they include in new blocks. So this ends up being a market situation where you attract miners by paying higher fees. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:22:12
How are vanity addresses safe? Don't they all involve having another party generate a private key for you?
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:57:58
It's way too technical for most people to understand.
Non-technical people can *use* it, but only as something equivalent in their minds to a credit card or Apple Pay. So unless they are in one of the situations where Bitcoin is clearly superior to the alternatives, like evading currency controls or sending remittances, it won't seem significant to them.
@_date: 2017-04-18 17:43:40
I still don't get how the incentive structure would work for a blockchain without being associated with a cryptocurrency. What incentive does anyone have to mine a block on a farmland blockchain? How often does farmland in a poor country switch hands? 
If you make the mining difficulty low, then people with any sort of computing power would forge transactions and claim someone's land. If the mining difficulty is high, then the only people mining will be the government or banks, in which case, you might as well use a centralized database.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:33:32
Thanks but is it chosen sequentially or randomly? I recently tried sending some bitcoin with bitcoin-cli and noticed it pulled a reserve address from the middle of my wallet instead of the first free one.
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:55:33
But are they talking about using the Bitcoin blockchain or a new one with new rules?
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:53:25
How does bitcoin core choose the change address for a transaction?
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:10:52
Are people saying that like it's a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:54:35
Sounds like they are mainly interested in it because it is 100% digital. Since they have no facilities to print money, any physical bills they issue would have to enter the country through the Israelis. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:11:44
Actually, you know what, I'd question the statement that all currencies are 100% digital. They may support the representation of users' wealth via online bank accounts, but does that mean that system can be used 100% remotely by all parties? Keep in mind the Palestinians' territory situation. 
I don't actually know much about how banking works, but now that I think about it, I would be surprised if there weren't some offline b2b processes that support the online b2c ones.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:39:30
I never said that you did. Floated currency can be insured too, just ask the FDIC
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:58:18
Cryptocurrency is just digital cash, which can be used for whatever people want it to be used for.
Because paper is so much easier for nation-states to wield for economy-crafting purposes than crypto, this Bitcoiner's opinion is that crypto will never truly replace paper. However, we may be looking at a unique situation where a legitimate nation-state *can't* use paper, and so it's evaluating crypto as an alternative. I find that interesting. I don't think it poses a threat to Bitcoin, though. Different use cases.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:13:48
The people who wish to use Bitcoin over fiat are a very small minority of people. For most everyday Palestinians it would be a choice of either US or Israeli government sanctioned money vs. their own government sanctioned money. Assuming the Palestinians have an ok relationship with their government (I don't actually know if they do or not), I think the choice is clear in that case, but of course Bitcoin will always be there as an option.
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:54:44
Yes, I'm serious, but it may sound like sarcasm only because my opinion is different. I love Bitcoin but I'm pretty skeptical about other blockchain things (including alts - I've never bought any but I'm generally happy they exist).
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:13:39
I would download [bitaddress.org]( then disconnect from the internet and print a paper wallet for cold storage. Or use Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:37:05
Thank you, that's what I wasn't sure about. I also hope their situation improves soon.
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:50:29
I get it - I know blockchains are inefficient. I'm just saying consider the Palestinians' situation. Their country is split into pieces, most of which is completely surrounded by a hostile power. How in the world could they ever circulate a national currency that's not 100% digital? That is the only reason they are interested in Bitcoin - it is a 100% digital currency - but they will probably not adopt Bitcoin as their currency.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:05:07
This might actually be the first sensible use case for a non-Bitcoin blockchain I've heard so far.
Any fiat currency has to have the property of being issuable at will by a central bank. That is because governments have to be able to insure their people's wealth. Bitcoin's play-at-your-own-risk nature can't work at a national level (even a nation as small as Palestine) because people won't participate in an economy they don't feel safe in. 
A government has to provide that safety if it's going to mandate a currency. The no-brainer solution there is to just print paper money, but Palestine is in a peculiar situation where it doesn't have a good way to do that.
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:07:21
They could make a crypto with only one mining node. So decentralized validation, centralized mining. It would allow the system to scale effortlessly along with adoption, without requiring further investment by the government, and without requiring the government to share write access.
That concept sounds ridiculous to us in Bitcoin-land because we can't imagine a world in which users would trust a single miner (or ANY number of miners) to control our money supply, and besides, if that was the case then why not just get a bank account? But if you're an oppressed people in a tiny geographical area, and the miner is your own elected government, and this is the only chance for a national currency you've got... who knows, it might not be such a bad idea in that case.

This should be stickied. I've found this feature extremely useful but lately it's been buried every Monday.
