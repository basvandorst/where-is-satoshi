You have no idea what you talkin about, mate. Currently 86% of traders are long, only 13% are short, what short squeeze do you mean??? You have no idea what a short squeeze is or how markets work. Stop confusing the masses, you idiot!
@_date: 2014-11-17 11:27:47
Not at all. It indicates accumulation which indicates of an incoming rally.
@_date: 2014-10-17 07:52:30
Are you out of your freakin mind? Barely moving??? It crashed 70% in just a few months, 30 of which in the last week!
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:34:55
Only bitcoinbravo gets the point, the rest of you are just plain fools who will lose their money.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:07:58
I will tell you only one thing - there are more successful brain surgeons than tape readers. Do you know what tape reading is, or order book to say? Do you know what the tape is currently screaming - IDIOTS IDIOTS IDIOTS BUYING AND GETTING FUKED UP, DON'T GO WITH THE SHEEPS, SHORT THE HELL OUT OF THIS PIG!!!

You and one million other fools, that's why it's not going to happen. Bitcoin is overcrowded with bulls, the bubble has bursted - it's 70% down of its highs and it's never going up to $1000 ever again. You're an idiot if you believe in these ridiculous "bitcoin to $10 000" predictions. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:39:42
I'm also bullish, went long at 350. I'm looking for a near-term rally towards 700s.
@_date: 2014-11-14 08:44:47
It's not confirmed, it sure does look like but it needs confirmation.

Provably fair Bitcoin Casino article provided by btccasino.blogspot.com
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:09:47
That's actually very BEARISH sign that bitcoin articles are appearing in the mainstream media. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 07:38:42
Bitcoin is going sub 100 just because every idiot and his grandma are buying and holding now. Markets don't favor the masses, the first time bitcoin surged to $1000 was because nobody saw it coming, now the bitcoin is overcrowded with buyers, look at any order book. It's not going to skyrocket, guys, sorry but this is the truth, you're all going to lose your savings into this bursting bubble.
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:33:59
Cuz that's how markets work in general.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:09:54
If only I received a dime every time I hear an average idiot that has never traded a market in his life say to me "It is going to the moon, it is going to skyrocket to $100 000, buy with all you can, it is down only a few percents - it can't go any lower than that!" and soon after it crashes down like hell. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:27:07
How much do you give anyway?
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:21:44
You deserve to be banned for giving money to such a piece of shit as shitopedia. This is a parody of an encyclopedia written by idiots for idiots. Nothing to do with any sanctions.
@_date: 2014-08-16 11:10:07
That's why it will drop under $400 - because it is highly unlikely. How long are you into trading markets? I'm for years and I can assure you that it is the most unlikely scenario that usually happens just because the markets are designed to screw most of the people most of the time and right now most of the people are bullish, nobody believes that bitcoin will crash that's why it will crash. 
I am a technical analyst, this guy tuur demester's chart is total crap! His trendlines are not valid, he is totally amateurish, he doesn't know a shit about technical analysis. There is no support on $400, the support is around 330s. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:35:53
Because this time everybody is expecting it, that's the difference.
@_date: 2014-11-16 08:54:24
This is the kind of thinking that has killed every market bubble back in history - it is called greed. Good luck, just don't forget to jump when the boat sink.
@_date: 2014-08-19 12:04:32
Trying to catch a bottom is a fool's game.

Login to your wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:33:40
Yep, I guess the next leg up shall be fueled by the Chinese again. Something to pay attention to for signs these days - the eastern exchanges.
@_date: 2014-09-02 08:38:24
Bullshit, I have 600 followers and didn't get a dime from them.
@_date: 2014-08-14 07:48:48
No, the reason why there isn't subreddit about predicting is that everybody on this idiotic forum is bullish, I'm the only one bearish and nobody thumbs up my posts, fuck these sheeps, let them lose their money, I predict Bitcoin sub 400 in a few days. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 08:54:12
Did you guys notice the all-time high volume spike last week?
@_date: 2014-09-20 10:44:08
Because the people are sheeps! Currently according to Bitfinex 83% of people are long BTC, which means that the only thing that can follow is sell off -there's nobody left to buy! This is a classic bubble burst.
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:06:16
Yeah, vote it down, idiots, this forum is full of sheeps who vote down words of truth and vote up idiotic stuff like "bitcoin to the moon". Losers. Soon you will all lose your money when bitcoin crashes down to where it started - 0. You all deserve it.
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:06:01
Why not? 19000 is not so much really especially for an exchange like Huobi.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:24:49
I'm buying now. This is the time to buy, not to sell - at the point of extreme pessimism.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:13:29
I just sold mine
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:21:18
They can get hacked too.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:23:47
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:40:55
Anyway, I'm observing closely Bitfinex for any signs of a chunk-dump to get out of the way.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:10:38
He's a contrarian LOL
@_date: 2014-09-02 08:39:08
If they still advertise it but they don't do it it's not old ad, it's called SCAM.
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:39:35
Hmm, you are right. However, there are many small exchanges that would be more than happy to accept their coins I think.
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:46:48
What do you think they'll do - dump them right away and create another 100 points price drop or just hide them in cold storage and wait for the dust to settle?
