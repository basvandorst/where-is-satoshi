Her response is admirable.

Further reinforcement for adding an educational component - thank you!  Delayed email reminder to send the gift is interesting - no need to part with the money in advance.  Will look at putting the video on the front page too.

Your comment persuaded me to move the video to the front page.  Check it out: [Biterica.com]( 
Also, please PM me your email address, I would like to send you some BTC via the service!
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:26:31
Correct.  At this time Biterica works exclusively with Bitcoin.  If using credit cards is something people want we can look into supporting it later.

I gifted Janet Yelling $20 of Bitcoin via [Biterica]( after the conference and here's what she responded:

Her curiosity was like trying a new type of food, or activity.  Maybe a small gift is all it takes to get people to give Bitcoin a fair shot?
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:26:44
It's possible she's been sheltered from the technology.  Now that she owns a little bit, perhaps she will find it not so scary.

Please PM me your email address.  I would like to gift you some BTC using [Biterica.com](

Thanks.  I appreciate your support!

Actually, unlike most exchanges, Blockchain does not store private keys!  They keys are generated via a one-way-hash of the password.  This is also the reason why if the user forgets their password (and hasn't made a backup), the wallet cannot be recovered.  Web wallets are not as secure as hardware wallets, but we think Blockchain is a fantastic custodian for a Bitcoin gift!

A lot of people don't have an address or prefer to keep it private.  Biterica allows sending a themed Bitcoin gift email to anyone with an email address.  
Biterica tries to avoid being a middleman as much as possible.  For example, the recipient's wallet is stored on [Blockchain.com]( and is funded directly by the sender.  We don't hold any private keys!
@_date: 2018-10-24 22:38:43
can you confirm you received your gift?
@_date: 2018-10-25 04:29:07
Thanks for the fantastic feedback!  Andreas Antonopolous' videos made a huge impact impact on my learning curve as well - huge fan!  I have been playing with the idea of adding an Education section where this type of content can be made available to new users.  Thanks for reinforcing this.  I especially like how you describe people's perspective outside of crypto's - baby steps!

Hi Victor!  Glad to have your eyes on this!  
Biterica allows sending Bitcoin to anyone with an email address.  We can set up a personalized donation page for each person in need, something like, Biterica.comwhere anyone can quickly make donations.  The receiving person would show social proof of the difficulties they are facing.  On donation, the receiver would gain an easy to use web wallet containing the donated Bitcoin.  Login is simple, requiring just a username and password.
Do you think this is something people in Venezuela would use?

@_date: 2018-10-25 18:05:19
Cool! PM me your email address.
@_date: 2018-10-25 18:42:20
You're welcome!  Glad to hear it was simple for you.  The goal is to make the entire gifting process as friction free as possible.

Hat tip to @_date: 2018-10-25 15:56:14
Wow, thanks!  Bitcoin is an amazing addition to world on its own!  Just happy to be a part of it.  
I'm playing with the idea of setting up personalized donation pages.  Our friend from Venezuela has the [technical know-how]( to set up a wallet, however, many people in need do not.  With Biterica, we could have a personalized link for anyone in need with an email address.
Press release coming tomorrow.  If you like Biterica, be one of the first to spread the word!
@_date: 2018-10-24 23:11:02
Thanks You hit it on the head.  Biterica's mission is to make Bitcoin easy.  We plan to do this by building tools that make Bitcoin as simple as clicking through links!
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:05:27
Thanks for the feedback.  Will revisit this today.  Check your inbox!
@_date: 2018-10-24 22:19:30
Your gift should be in your email.  Thanks for trying out Biterica!

Any interest from in *gifting* Bitcoin via the Lightning Network?  It's been suggested in the past and is something we're considering adding to [Biterica.com]( 
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:58:10
PM me your email, I’ll send you some BTC with Biterica 
@_date: 2018-10-25 15:20:52
Yes.  I would add that the wallet generated with a Biterica gift is a full-fledged wallet that can be used for all types of  transactions in the future.
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:15:01
Hi Stratomaster2018, thanks for the compliment!  


This is how Biterica works today.  You send some of the Bitcoin you already own as a gift.  Gifting is a simple use case for spending Bitcoin - i.e. to get friends and family in.

Super excited to launch Biterica: Gift Bitcoin forward - (you guys are the best). Not sure what's the best place for the post.
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:07:01
Can you check your inbox and confirm here when you receive the gift?  Thanks!
@_date: 2018-10-24 23:38:43
Good question.  [Biterica.com]( takes the complexity out of the process by doing all the heavy lifting in the background.  First Biterica creates a secure wallet and generates an address.  The user receives a temporary password which is changeable on login to take full control of the private keys.  Wallet custody is handled by Blockchain, the biggest, most trusted web wallet.  All the receiver needs to do is login to the website - easy!
@_date: 2018-10-24 22:06:04
PM me the email address where you would like to receive your BTC gift!

It's with similar intentions that [Biterica.com]( was started.  There's no better way to seed Bitcoin curiosity than with a small gift.
