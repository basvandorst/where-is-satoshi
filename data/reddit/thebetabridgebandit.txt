I’m surprised people haven’t figured this out yet. I started using BTC about 5 years ago for its intended purpose (as an anonymous digital currency for activities on Tor). Now everyone seems to have a boner for it and it fucking exploded in value and can’t perform its intended purpose. I love the idea of crypto currency but BTC is functionally ruined because every dipshit and their mom bought some when they heard a few people made a million bucks.

I’m just here to have a good time.

He's entirely correct and I say this as someone who smoked weed daily for several years and know many, many others who still do.  You can smoke and be successful but daily/frequent use is pretty well correlated with negative motivational outcomes.

100k is what some kid makes a year out of college in that industry.  Try a few times that.

Anecdotally I know more than a few friends from undergrad who were pulling 6 figures 18-24 months from graduation. 
They were working insane hours but still..

It's not too much of a leap, the leftover scraps from when I use it have been slowly appreciating since 2014 for me.  Those 'scraps' from 2014 ain't so scrappy anymore..

Not an implicit endorsement of bitcoin. More of an explicit fuck you to Venmo.

Yeah it’s super convenient until a scammer cleans out your checking account

I ditched venmo once they showed that they give 0 shits about protecting or helping you when fraud occurs through their service.  Somehow my 2-FA account was compromised and I almost lost the 3K in my checking account because of it.  Venmo was absolute dogshit when it came to stopping these transactions, getting reimbursed or even just apologizing for their inept handling of the fraudulent transactions.  If it weren't for my longstanding relationship with my bank Venmo would literally have let the thief walk away with thousands of dollars of my money without so much as a 'sorry'.
That company fucking sucks and I'm evangelical about how shitty they were to me.

Black markets are arguably what drove the adoption of bitcoin and there is a lot of overlap between deep web communities and bitcoin users.  That's why it gets posted here.

Some sad, pathetic people on reddit man. Hopefully they gain some perspective when they grow up.

This is so fake it hurts.

A resident making 450k is just a straight up lie. Like an eye-roll level of lie.

Is electrum still a safe wallet to use? That's typically where I store my coins now but I haven't looked into wallets in a few years as I only collect BTC casually
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:48:11
What's the difference between something like electrum and wasabi, aside from the coin mixing?

Thanks for the info man I really appreciate it. I did all my research a few years ago so I’m a bit out of the loop now.
