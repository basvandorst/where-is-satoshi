100% agreed.
/end of Bitcoin bubble panic talk.

Folks OP is right, end of the show. The whole Bitcoin idea is doomed.. Maybe on a different planet a decentralized currency can work..
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:02:09
I doubt it.

That's how that goes. Even when it comes to ordinary money, you never speak of it. "I'm doing alright, could be better.."

I decided to board this rollarcoaster right after the $1200 peak at $880 a pop. With the mindset of selling at around 1100 (quick buck). And now this ride is taking a steep drop. Oh well.. I didn't invest with money i cant afford.. And I'm not selling at a loss. Going to ride this one out. IMO bit-coin is here to stay and this is just another dip.  
Predictions? None. Just liked the idea of bit-coin then and still like it now. It is revolutionary, no?

OK. Either you're a decent troll or in kindergarten..

I follow preev.com I think it averages out all the market prices into one number.

If you want to buy Bitcoins. First do some research on having a **secure** wallet (you can search around Reddit for help on that). 
Coinbase? Yes i also had trouble with Coinbase. They kept rejecting me for no reason. After clearing a few transactions with them i placed an order for 10btc on Oct 8th. Waited three days.. denied. A month later bitcoins 10x. Wasn't pleased.
I now Buy/Sell bitcoins through person. You can try Locabitcoins.com (but look out for there heavy fees). 
Also do some due diligence. I doubt the subject of Bitcoin is being thought in schools. Its kinda a big thing. I bought myself a notebook and self thought myself this new/controversial/revolutionary  subject during the summer time.

Yeah definitely some good LOLs on this dip.
EDIT: oh boy $495

Okay according to the graph and some book I've recently read:
If i stick to trading amounts i can afford..
And buy low, sell high.. 
I too can be a successful pokemon trader??!1

Go for it. GL

My dumb advice:
1. Bet what you can afford to lose.
2. Scared money doesn't make money.
3. Buy low, sell high. &lt;- STICK TO THIS. 
*Don't get emotional.*
If it means dropping 80% of your bankroll on Bitcoin because its at a low.. so be it. But are you going to be asking for spare change if the unthinkable happens?
