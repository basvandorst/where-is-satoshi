Yea sorry I saw the whole interview on tv and assumed it was all on the link provided :S
@_date: 2014-04-12 17:35:45
The actual article does not mention Bitcoin.

My hero.

Just seeking some clarification: are these stories from well-known and widely distributed (and trusted) newshouses in China / east-Asia, or are they murmerings on blogs and in comment sections that got out of hand?
Also, is it the Chinese bitcoin community that is spooked, a large portion of the wider community or just people outside of China?
@_date: 2014-07-13 23:06:28
Its a UK store that buys and resells electronics, console games, etc
@_date: 2014-09-01 18:41:26
Yeah, but I still found it somewhat amusing.
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:44:14
Me too, incredibly greatful for it!

I think I was going by the large header at the top of the article, which says: "Divorce's new weapon: Separating spouses using Bitcoin to hide wealth from estranged partners during court battles". Simply posting something I saw, I did not state whether or not it is correct either :)
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:11:15
You don't "have to" lol. Do whatever you want ;)
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:03:25
So are these sold out? Did a bit of snooping but brain does not compute...
@_date: 2014-02-22 02:46:49
Change your bank, or are they all the same?

@_date: 2019-03-02 01:49:10
So it's an ad?

@_date: 2017-11-09 23:54:36
In my experience it's always worked out better to buy bitcoin. Just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:48:09
I think it's one of these: [ESP32 Module with OLED](
Need OP to clarify!

Is this board powered by usb cable? I read somewhere that there is a lack of power-over-usb due to a design-flaw
