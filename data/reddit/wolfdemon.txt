Both are the same company. Putting your bitcoin on gdax from coinbase is instant and free.

I'll believe it's supported by a majority when it's declassified and legal in every state. The extremely vocal ones against it will just use this as another talking point: "see! Bitcoin is still just a way to buy illegal drugs!"

You got a point on that second bit. But not everyone really knows he's a comedian. Most people know him as either the host of UFC or the Fear Factor guy. I don't think many "normal"  people knows he did/does stand up or a podcast. Don't get me wrong, I like both weed and bitcoin, but I don't think his tweet helps either one of those

As a Montanan, why do we get it first?

Thanks for setting public perception of bitcoin backwards

Not to toot our horn or anything but we're the first state to do anything about ensuring net neutrality statewide after the FCC voted to gut the national regulations

The transaction ID is:
But now it doesn't even show up on block explorer, but still does on blockchain.info and still not confirmed.

I sold .1btc at 18k and it kept going up so I had to buy back at 18.2k :(

Yeah, to hell with lambos tbh

This is a thing? The tellers at my bank only ever ask how my day is going. Do all the major banks do this? Mine is semi-local, operating in 3 states

Thanks, that definitely makes sense.

Meh, I mined a long while ago on that pool but got out of it and forgot I didn't transfer like ~5BTC to my wallet and it just got taken back/redistributed into the pool
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:34:25
Elaborate on those signs of it happening to voat already please

Wait, when the hell did it become a thing to cal a delivery driver a "mobile waiter"?
@_date: 2012-07-15 09:59:57
I thought this has been allowed for a while now. I remember being upset about this a year ago. Almost all food trucks I've been to who have Square Readers charge 50 cents extra for using a card.

@_date: 2012-09-25 06:32:59
Can someone explain to me what is the point of this?
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:02:03
I always laugh at the people who say waiters and waitresses should get a better job. Always looking down on the service industry. Imagine how pissed those same people would be if they went to a restaurant to get waited on only to be greeted by a person sitting st a cash register and order their food the same way you would at McDonalds because servers quit to find said mythical "better jobs" that everyone tells them they should get.

When did anyone say that was a bad idea? OP's problem was leaving a tip only in BTC.

I know a guy who owns a few subway franchises, I wonder if he'd be willing to accept bitcoin

I HOPE we get to the despair phase because I'd like to actually buy some bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:46:07
By the time I came across this post bitcoin fell a few hundred dollars but now it's back up nearly to where it was yesterday.

It's a lanyard my wife got me from hot topic. Great quality actually, I love it!
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:08:15
Especially since OP specifically mentioned adding a BTC tip as an extra bonus. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:44:56
I had no idea that the term "internet" was considered a denomination of bitcoins. I chuckled at that. I guess I've been giving people fake Internets all these years

I always run my graphics card mining, I figured I could just get this instead and save my gpu from an early death as a replacement graphics card is far more than what I paid for the block erupter.
