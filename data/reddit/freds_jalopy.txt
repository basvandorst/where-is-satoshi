Nah cruises are cheap as hell now. That would be 10x what a nice cruise costs.

Cool, thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:35:32
The childishly ridiculous meme you uploaded. If you honestly think it's making a reasonable point, then I really can't help you.
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:21:25
God this sub is shit. Who is upvoting all this bullshit? Are y'all that fucking stupid?
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:45:53




Well done.
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:44:02
Do you know any alternative subs? I'm done with this garbage, it's embarrassing to be associated.

"14 but I'm really advanced for my age"

It's not support for central banks, it's people calling attention to the ridiculous amount of financial illiteracy that plagues this sub and many vocal supporters of Bitcoin &amp; cryptos in other spaces. Spouting ignorance loudly will not help with gaining support, especially regarding new ideas like cryptos.

We were talking about square... Bill Gates didn't invent operating systems either... In any case yes there's no such thing as a perfect analogy but hopefully you can see my point? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:59:16
... that doesn't answer the question, so I have to assume you did poorly in economics 101. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:48:47
Actually, it's a terrible comparison. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:39:09
That's a serious dick move. It reminds me of the people who bulk buy and resell concert tickets. You're really fucking over PC builders to make a few bucks. 
Edit: stop repeating basic capitalism concepts at me, they don't excuse you being a cunt. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:33:04
From their writer expressing morally corrupt reasoning. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:06:42
I understand the financial rewards, I don't understand the defense of the act. "I'm a greedy fuck" would be true, but people are keen to hide behind the market as if that absolves them. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:50:04


Are you also buying these cards with stolen money?


OK, then you're the ordinary type of greedy asshole. Again, your arguments are not compelling in the slightest. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:53:58
The free market guides your moral compass? That's horrifying. 
It's a dick move. Welcome to society. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:42:17
Translation: "I can't explain my own argument because I was just spewing angry nonsense."
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:40:49
Most sentences that start with "that's like saying" are going to be bad analogies, and this is no different. A scalper is very obviously not a retail store.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:22:15
Meh, it's not really backwards it's just a different perspective. I don't really care what Bill Gates thinks of Microsoft even though he obviously believes(believed?) in it himself because although he has far more information than most, he's far more biased than most.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:46:13
Maybe, but that's neither here nor there. Buying cards to gouge end-users is wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:35:47
Square is literally in the *title* of this post. 
Of course the analogy isn't perfect, that's impossible, it's supposed to help find common ground. Please explain how your distinction between Gates and Dorsey makes Dorsey unbiased regarding Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:49:11
That's simply not true. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:54:08
That's the whole point of this thread, isn't it? I told someone I don't like what they were going to do, and others jumped in on both sides. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:29:28
I'm saying if we're choosing ideals, I'm going to support morality over the free market. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:51:28




Holy shit this is the most ironic comment I've ever seen on Reddit. The thread absolutely did not start that way, and literally right above it is a comment about Square. You have to actually scroll up to read the top, pretty complicated I know. I guess someone needs to explain to *you* how comment threads work. Yikes... 
You only jumped in two comments later, so I don't know how you got confused.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:56:36
It's not difficult at all to see that this is wrong. Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:36:11
From what I can understand of that massive sentence, it's filled with abysmal reasoning. 
People supporting resales: *this ^* is the guy you're supporting.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:00:30
What if they rob the bank and donate it to feeding the poor? Is this less moral than letting a the bank make a profit? What if they only donate 75%? 50%? at what point would the morality flip to the bank's favor?
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:27:23
You're giving me the value-add from the perspective of the product, which is not what I'm asking. 
Also I hope your life is completely free from anal cancer, I have no idea WTF these other comments are doing. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:44:25
That's exactly the issue: many can't buy them because the resellers are buying up the cards to gouge those same people. "Business is business" is literally a cartoon villain phrase.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:34:23
Not sure how it's more efficient at all, using your example the queue would still be loaded with resellers and the end users would still pay extra for... nothing. I don't see how this is different from the ticket resellers or pharma companies the public loves to condemn, yet they jump at the first opportunity to do the same. A card reseller is not adding value, just as ticket resellers aren't and as pharma companies aren't. "Not my fault people will pay it" as seen above is a really dickish attitude. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:31:41
intentionally gouging others for your personal profit is a dick move is the point
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:52:47
That's really condescending. You asked if I should "let this productive inefficiency exist" which is an idealistic scenario almost completely out of my control, so you got an idealistic answer. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:55:54
Again. We live in a society. If "should" has gone out the window for you, I hope we never cross paths. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:20:35
I never mentioned their entitlement to anything. You absolutely *are* fucking other people over to pad your own pockets whether you want to admit that or not. What exactly is the value-add that entitles *you* to profit as a reseller? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:14:18
That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:39:14
Yeah no kidding. WTF are these responses? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:52:14
The comment above mine was a nonsensical comparison.
 To address your comment: "if I don't do it someone else will" is a terrible argument and doesn't absolve anyone of anything. Buying cards to resell is a dick move. It's funny how this sub is suddenly fine with taking advantage of others once they're on the other end.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:43:53
Not true in the the bay area. There are different rules here.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:01:50
Buy a card if you need a card, don't if you don't. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:40:43
They haven't YET. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 06:48:15
That's completely missing the point. The cost does not come from "what it costs to make" or the raw material cost. It is so much more complicated than that. 
If it's not worth the price, don't buy it. It's really simple.
Welcome to the free market.
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:55:38
... do you have a point or are you reiterating what I said for some reason?
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:48:40
The "cost to make" argument is totally ridiculous outside specific industries, yet I see it all the time... Your iPhone is &lt;$100 in raw materials. So. Fucking. What.
