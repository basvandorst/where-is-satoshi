Read the post, would you?
Unless your Trezor comes with a built in exchange, you still need to go through one of the exchanges (though id stay the heck away Gdax/Coinbase) to get ur fiat into btc

Ye.. Funny thing is that 16 USD fee is now regarded as low. Do you consider me a spammer because I try to get a 300 sat/b transaction through?

Exactly. Isn't this thread kinda like comparing a wallet with an income source. You can't say "no" to a job because you got a new fancy leather wallet...
...Unless OP was actually using Coinbase to HODL...?

Make sure it's updated and after that you just need to use good old common sense :) With that, I mean don't open/start files you don't know for sure is safe

1 BTC = 4000$ 
0.1 BTC = ?$
That's your little math problem for today.

A bank will always be a target for robbers. That does not mean it's safer to keep the money in your mattress.
Not saying you shouldn't hold the wallet yourself, but saying "ALWAYS" is a strong statement.

People that bought BTC for the "free 2X coins" will move it back to alt coins
