Doge doing well, bitcoin doing well, Ethereum doing well, and so on... it all progresses the end goal of cryptocurrencies. A majority of bitcoiners seem to be religious purists.
How many people had to buy bitcoin to buy their doge? All of them? In the process they increased volume and learned about BTC, the exchanges, etc.

You smart. BUT, they likely haven't accepted it. I am also skeptical enough that this may be a troll.

I'm under the impression that he's too dangerous for this option and likely a flight risk.
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:05:29
I only own bitcoin and a minor holding in darkcoin. Doge, a direct competitor, doing things like this relates directly to bitcoin. Just because you don't want to acknowledge them doesn't mean they don't exist.
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:25:22


I don't represent another "coin". 


I think Doge is a terrible investment. But they have continuously done remarkable things.

You're kidding, right? That is the worst, most circlejerk, market analysis I've ever seen.

Coinbase is not an exchange. It's a payment processor and gateway. I am obviously planning on not selling these in the next 6 days.
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:48:29
Hi, welcome to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:31:12
I'm past that... been around since the end of 2012. I'll just sit on these until the next run. Could be a long time still, but the buy pressure seems to be building around me. Had a random friend of a friend ask about how to buy them the other day. That hasn't happened in a while.
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:47:11
I'm over the instant-buy limit for Coinbase. I also don't have any USD sitting on exchanges anymore. I'll likely move this over to cold storage anyway besides $100. Maybe keep a few coins on Coinsetter to play with. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:41:13
That is a terrible way to watch your investment in the bitcoin world. You'll make bad emotional sells. You cast a fishing line and keep tabs on the floating bobber in the water.
Yes, I know it's not your money... but its also hardly a way to interpret this guy's expectations. He's hodling for a while I would assume.
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:34:08
You've increased my bullish stance. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:46:06
Probably a $500 coin preferred. I'd take 50% gains though. It really depends on where the bottom is.
If there's still truly a ways to go, then I'd take marginal returns if the opportunity came and I'd be buying again near that bottom. But, if we're near the bottom now, I'd forecast it out into a 3x or 4x multiple.
Once the floodgates of "don't miss this boat again" opens up, these coins will be a solid purchase. I have no real doubt. At this point, I believe the price is too low due to the Bitstamp thing (which really wasn't that bad) and stupid Silk Road stuff but that's not really what creates the "excitement" needed to drive price. It's all a bandwagon thing and that is what I feel early signs of happening again.
I mean knock on wood, but I have continuously bought at a conservative bottom (like now) and sold at a conservative top (like my $800 big sell last time).
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:53:38
If you're going to watch it day by day, lock the gains now and sell. Otherwise, take a more relaxed approach and keep it for 6mo before reevaluating.
These types of bumps are common and insignificant. 
Might be setting yourself up for an emotional sell off if/when the price drops again.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:47:21


The other side of why they would want to keep the delay is for fraud. They are primarily a fraud prevention company.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:24:34
Great... I hadn't looked at the price until I saw this. Crap
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:15:54
Demand will for sure outpace that when the market is bullish. It's all about those people that aren't buying when things are calm / downtrending (which is when newly mined coins really effect price most too). Then there's a crash of some kind and people start pulling triggers for "cheap" coins which invokes people's emotion to not miss the train again. We might be in that drop, that's what this bet is placed on but I'm fully prepared to seek another bottom if it isn't.
I would be doubtful, and should be, but I'm not. I've been through so many of these darn things at this point. When the peak broke, I told my friends it'd go down around $150. I wish I had made a bet on that.

This comment is stupid.
@_date: 2013-11-03 05:42:16
Hi all, the response has been extraordinary. I was expecting a simple post with a couple responses. Feel free to PM as I will be explaining more to anyone with interest, but I have decided to delete this thread from additional visitors. 
Thank you to everyone that PM'd and showed interest!
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:16:36
I don't think you understand what is being said - neither in this post or in today's news.
For those curious what was deleted by "*At the time of this writing, there are 320 products listed on Taobao (China’s largest e-commerce platform with transaction volume exceeding $140bn USD annually) that can be purchased with bitcoin. ( Bitcoin transaction are completely legal and in use in China..Bobby Lee was wrong)* *

No, it is not. I'm super bearish, but this OP is just in panic.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:08:14
He's called me a shill on several occasions across several threads in the past few days.
Insane. And his other looney post is at the top of bitcoin's front.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:46:50
Assuming that no payment processor can work with bitcoin, and whatever additional rules the previous announcement implies, then bitpay or any company like it is not allowed in China.
When we're dealing with China, the proxy-account doesn't apply. You need to directly register and be a business of the republic. Not even "extremely unlikely". That is an incorrect statement.

All of this is completely dependent on how the investor relation and the number of investors. I was not expecting so much of a response here and have my own potential investors I've initiated the discussion with. I wanted to see if I could round off the corners if necessary - but appreciate the reponse regardless!
So, to answer honestly nothing is set in stone on that end. Fair and open is all I can promise. I am just capable of making it happen, so given those investor unknowns, it is an open conversation.
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:16:35
The legal implications of this notion... and the increased time per customer would not be worth it. That is better sutied for a laptop grinding the games.

I'll allow him to make a real case with actual facts at any point. The requirement of proof is not our responsibility. This dude babbles on with conspiracy shit for upvotes. It's pathetic.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:26:23
Your reply is redundant.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:25:04
You are very correct in your assumption. Don't try to play a market that has no actual information available.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:58:51
They are leading the way in those regards and also have extremely competent lawyers. I know them and am very confident in what they say. Through my own companies I also have an understanding of the law and "grey"ness of it. These machines will be USD -&gt; BTC only to start most likely.

There are several ways to make things happen.

We will see - I would actually prefer to be loved with lower profit than have customers feel cheated. Many investors may not like that, but I work hard and that is how I operate. It's a long-term plan.

We'll let the market decide! I'm bullish.

10 bucks says you're the same guy. Who uses the word "shill" this much? Jesus, go outside and get a life.
PS: I'm only commenting because, if you are the same person, I would love to see the reply(s).
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:34:19
You are a joke. I guess the shill bots are upvoting me and downvoting you at insanely different multiples. Do you even understand how inaccurate vote counts are on Reddit? It's an algorithm, not actual 1 for 1.
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:53:10


This is your stance now? baha. C'mon man.

@_date: 2013-12-17 18:05:18
Look at OP's comment history. He is completely paranoid, calls everyone a shill, and - to me - is borderline insane. It is annoying as fuck that people upvote this type of bullshit.

The legal side of these ATMs are mostly already defined by the ATM companies themselves. I already have lawyers in the area that will be taking care of the licensing, we will also be pursuing a money transmitter license for several reasons, one being the ATMs.
The best answer, however, is that these ATMs are still in a grey area so we'll execute it based on best all-encompassing legal advice from our representation. The only tricky part of the legality is the bitcoin exchange nature of the ATMs themselves, the rest does not break any typical-business mold that already is in use.
I can answer any other questions you have to the best of my knowledge.

1000 upvotes mean nothing. I once posted a repost of a shitty hand drawn comic of an elderly woman showing her tits. It went to the front page of reddit - my highest post in 4 years of membership here.
People pitchfork on here. It is very difficult to find true endings and uncover the real facts.

You both are such good trolls, that neither of you have figured the other one out.

That is illegal under Las Vegas and gaming law. =(

I involved in many bitcoin related businesses. I have interest but am pooling to see if there are exceptional partners that see this.
Attack from all directions and put together the best deal for those involved. I also don't go knocking on my neighbor's door every day asking for money. The relation / connection is more important than money.

Also, my background is in corporate and operation finance at casinos in Las Vegas. I understand the numbers a bit and why people would be skeptic (and they should be, we're talking about an investment here).
@_date: 2013-11-03 05:07:02
I would argue that, since Las Vegas is ~60% repeat travellers, that a person that originally used the machine on their first trip would likely repeat the next. We will also be pursuing money transmitter and that would enable BTC &lt;--USD--&gt; BTC.
But who knows, it's just a market size. Official number is just under 40 mm visitors.
