I'm still getting the "Internal server error" when attempting to transfer bitcoins. Still no response from support
From everything I've read about their situation, there is no good reason for them to be blocking wallet to wallet transactions...

"internal server error" is unrelated to USD tied up in Bitfloor.
Existing BTC balances held at Bitfloor cannot be transferred to another wallet due to this error.
This is unrelated to any bank suspension of their USD account.
There's no reason to restrict transferring BTC to another wallet. 
I have BTC in the same limbo and Roman is completely unresponsive via email.

Bitcoin wallet transfers still don't work!
I have over $2000 in bitcoins that I cannot transfer because I get an "internal server error". 
This has been happening for months. Roman hasn't responded to any emails to support

In addition to support I've tried emailing Roman Shtylman's Gmail (Shtylman and his lawyer John Snyder (John

I've got 19 BTC I've been trying to transfer almost daily since April. 
I've emailed Roman and his attorney multiple times. No response at all. What is troubling to me is the lack of intent to allow us to transfer our btc balances to another wallet. There was no legitimate excuse for this since day one.

No. And now when I log in, there is not BTC balance. Roman is a goddamn thief.

And now when I log in, there is no BTC balance. Roman is seeming like a petty thief.

I've been trying to withdraw my BTC balance since April. For months, every withdrawal attempt resulted in "Internal Server Error". Now it says "Your request could not be processed at this time. Please try again in a few seconds." I've tried this many times over the last week and get the same error.
I've emailed support dozens of times, with no response. I've emailed Roman's gmail address. I've emailed his lawyer. No responses from anybody.
Bitfloor has not even stated an intent to allow people to withdraw their BTC balance.
I suspect Roman Shtylman thinks he can get away with stealing peoples' BTC balance without consequences.

Thanks for helping push this issue. I'm glad the Attorney General will get involved. At this point, it is very difficult to give Roman Shtylman the benefit of the doubt. He hasn't given any indication that he intends to return our money.
