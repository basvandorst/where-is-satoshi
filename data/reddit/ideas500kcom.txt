Impressive. I am sure BTC will reach $100,000 price mark in a few years.

It can go to 0 and it can go to $100,000 and higher too. I am pretty sure it will never go below $1k ever.

It is all good, the only files that were damaged were pictures. Yes, writing down seed phrase on something solid is a great safety practice.

'' I have a domain name called BTCdude with a .com suffix. It is currently not functioning.
I would like to know what could be the best use of this domain name. I would like to create a website for it, but I am not too sure what would it be about. It should be Bitcoin-friendly.
Have you got any simple ideas?''

Domain Squatter - According to the United States Federal Government, domain squatting is the bad faith practice of purchasing, registering, and trafficking internet domain names with “the intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else.”
That is not my intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark. 
My domain names have catchy names and I am looking forward to selling them to anyone who wants to build a brand out of it.

I am glad I am holding a few crypto-related domain names for entrepreneurs to acquire and use for their business purposes.

Thank your input. That is exactly what I thought off I could do with my other Bitcoin domain name, which is [BitcoinRoot.com](

You don't know the crypto related domain name selling market. Just sold one for the exact price.

506 days or  72,988 blocks left until the Bitcoin halvening!

2019 is going to be a great year, since we are at the near bottom for Bitcoin value.

If you are one of the 100 top Bitcoin wallet holders and you communicate with one another and know when someone is about to sell or buy, you can tell.
