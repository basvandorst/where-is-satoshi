This wouldn’t of happened to him if he held bitcoin instead. If he had he would of been tortured for his keys then killed ��

I'm at a loss here... Honestly I don't hold any bitcoin currently, I am invested in a variety of alts (trx, xvg, ven, poe, kin.) It seems every time bitcoin goes on a bull run alts bleed, ALSO when bitcoin tanks alts bleed. When exactly do alts not bleed?!

I would highly recommend selling some of it if you have bills to pay. I made the mistake of not selling off my alt coins which went from 7k -&gt; 50k in a couple of days time. Then they fucking tanked down to below my initial investment. I didn't sell any because I was greedy. Kicking myself for sure.

Don't click this bois
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:17:08
It's because alts took a huge fucking hit when bitcoin went on its "rally" They can't dip much further.
