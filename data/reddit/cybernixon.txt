I find this akin to marking your selling price on Craigslist as $1 and hiding the real selling price within the post itself.

But if 12 shady miners claimed to have solved it (or 11 confirm the first), could someone do double transactions before the rest of the legit miners actually solve it?
I'm thinking that my questions are moot because of my fairly "consumer level" understanding of the whole thing...

How did you get around T-Mobile's 90 day availability restriction for the Pay By The Day plans?  
Maybe I'm reading [their fine print]( wrong...

With this information, I can make my car payment from the seller's account. I'm guessing the account holder would contest and hope their bank helps them out?

I don't understand the whole thing enough to explain this threat that I thought of...  
What if an attacker started, say 12 miners. A few minutes before a new block is expected, one of these miners says "here it is!". Then, the other 11 miners "agree" with that solution.. That's 12 confirms. Most clients require only 6, right?  
I'm thinking that my understanding of bitcoin is too simplified and this can't happen. Whad'ya think?
