Far from reality of the economics. 
Debt denominated in USD is backed by taxes and the ability to print money.
Contrary to this sub's belief, printing money responsibly pushes inflation to the target range which isn't a bad thing.
Fed role is maximum employment and steady prices which inflation targets help since deflation and stagflation are far worse than 2% inflation.

Same story for 2013.

Reddit, the place where being adept in economics is commonplace.
Interest rates and bond yields make current price to earnings ratios rational and permissible. However international developing and emerging both look attractive versus the US markets.
Furthermore the recent trade negotiations have garnered uncertainty so many would argue the US market has been depressed rather than bubbled at current valuations.
Small cap has been trading at 20% premium the 20 year average, largely due to tax reform, however large cap and mid cap are within a couple percent where they have traded on average.
So, no USD the reserve currency of the world doesn't look to be shaking anytime soon. And economic leading and trailing data point towards continued growth of the economy.

Currency manipulation as a term that's pretty clearly defined. It's government intervention in the FX market to drive their currency up or down.
To be clear, no not all central banks do it. For example, the US monetary policy mainly consists of the federal funds rate cuts/hikes. That is not a FX intervention.
Their QE consisted mainly of FFR and open market bond purchases running up their balance sheet to further support rates.
Note that through typical consumption the current accounts of various countries will contain foreign currencies as reserves or deficits.

1. Wires cost $15-25 unless you're working with a shitty bank.
2. Anyone worth this position at said institution knows how to process a wire.
3. It would take longer to buy BTC from USD since the fastest way requires a wire first or a delay in settlement from an exchange.
4. The other side would have to be willing an able to accept the volatile commodity. Exposing them to a non-fixed fee due to market risk.
In today's world the use case is more theoretical than practical.

@_date: 2019-06-17 02:39:21
It has swung 20% in 20min. But sure we can say 5% or 10%.
I'd rather pay a $20 wire fee to send $10,000 than risk the receiver receiving $9000 or literally anything under $9980.
It's still years away from the volatility being low enough for transactional use. Plus on the global scale it's current use is a rounding error away from 0% for the number of transactions globally.
Not saying I don't see the vision, I think people just get a little too excited about a reality that's far off.
It's been 10 years and still nearly 0 use other than as a speculative asset.

Sorry but if you don't have a bank account then having a crypto wallet won't solve your problems as 99.99% of retail stores, businesses, etc don't accept crypto as payment. The primary issue is the taxable event generated by spending crypto.
You can enter the wire yourself online at most banks for a discounted fee of $10-15 (which doesn't change unlike trx fees which float). 
Also how many people need to wire money in their daily life? Most don't need to ever send a wire. In fact venmo/Zelle would suffice for just about any transaction.

Nevertheless, I will end the conversation with the simple point that BTC solves a problem that doesn't need to be solved in 2019. It solves a problem that will need solving by 2119. Sure it can be situationally applied and benefit *some* people.
There are practical uses of blockchain (not currency specific) that are being applied currently I won't use my comment/post history to shill but other uses right now are supply chain management.

If you don't have a bank account you have other worries. That value prop is kinda a hoax as after 10 years it still hasn't "banked the unbanked" especially with the 'premium" of a potentially $50 trx fee. Those people would stick to cash only also those people don't even have enough cash to put under their mattress and are an afterthought, unfortunately, for BTC development. Literally the weakest argument for the value prop of BTC. The rest is good and all but for the other 5B that have access to banks, it hasn't disrupted bank use. Maybe venmo was born out of it but that solves the problem for small transactions and for large transactions a fixed wire fee is a minor speed bump but no way a billion dollar transaction would rather pay a trx fee and expose to market risk/currency risk when a $10 fee alleviates that.

This isn't my chart. It was shared months ago I was reshareing it. That said this is a non-linear regression. Adoption curves move towards linear near zero slope as they reach maturity. So that would help indicate eventual low volatility which is good for a currency coin.


Sorry it's not my original chart, though an updated version could be made. I may look at the chart as of a more recent date.


There are historical times where it overshoots or undershoots. We are still above the indicated relative low by 20% with plenty of time to go until the relative low according to the chart.


With Metcalfe's theory/law it would align with this type of chart showing a logrithmic slowing of adoption. Much like an "S" curve.
2023 isn't that long off. Look into cash adoption, credit card adoption, then crypto adoption. We aren't far off of the typical expected adoption rate.


Though not my graph, my background is in mathematics. Though my background isn't in numerical analysis, the theory of a non-linear regression is not too difficult. This chart isn't that "bad" of a representation given a lot of the above provided background and historical evidence of prior monetary tools.

Did you totally miss the sweeping changes the DOL imposed last year? Self directed was disallowed along with fiduciary requirements.

What about the 87 day moving average and the 193 day moving average?
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:57:47
But rarely do people use number of days you chose.
Generally speaking those very uncommon lengths of time for moving averages. They were as arbitrary as the two I offered up.
Usually people use 10, 20, 50 or 60, 100, 200.
10 reflects 2 weeks (in stock market where only 5 trading days equals two weeks).
20 reflects a month of trading days.
50/60 reflects a quarter
100 reflects half a year and 200 reflects a year.

That's some comfort food fed to you, the average college student pays full (the average degree in America is something like $125k) those households shelling out that capital likely average a lot more. It wouldn't surprise me if the average college kids net worth is $100k+.

You can either charge the same for card and cash OR discount for cash. You can't charge more if credit.
That's why it's a cash discount. That's the legal way to do it

P/E ratio is one figure. Look to historical sharp ratios, free cash flow, debt ratios, ownership distribution, the lost goes on.
But I suppose the P/E ratio is a good place to start if you don't understand equities.

I'm just saying because you chose uncommonly used MAs that people think you cherry picked.
It doesn't matter that this market is different when everyone still uses the standardized MAs.


My opinion is that you chose an unusual reference point to find something interesting in the data. This is called data mining bias. 


It doesn't mean anything only that the shorter term average is crossing over the longer term average.
The ONLY reason why the 60 crossing say the 200 would "mean something" is because the collective opinion in TA is that is an indicator if confirmed by rising volume and/or sentiment change through analysis. Further analysis could indicate confirmation such as using Bollinger bands or RSI etc.
TL;DR: it doesn't mean anything but it doesn't mean you're not wrong. My one line original response (if familiar with common indicators) just highlighted the fact that it was an obscure choice and not interesting.
