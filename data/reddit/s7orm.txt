Yep! Economic natural selection.
I am in no way suggesting Bitcoin would die, I have very strong opinions on how Bitcoin will survive regardless, especially in the criminal space.
But regardless, don't we want wide adoption of Bitcoin, isn't that a desirable end state?
@_date: 2016-08-24 00:51:38
But do you realistically expect &gt;90% of the population to depend on family for help to project their keys? I think (in my personal opinion) this will disenfranchise the general population from Bitcoin. A good organisation can have insurance, best practice implementation, and 24/7 security monitoring.
Not everyone needs that, but I think the majority do.
@_date: 2016-08-23 21:52:43
I totally get why this is attractive to some people, but let's be honest, &gt;90% of the population will do worse security and key management than *most* Banks. I've come to realisation that for Bitcoin to go mainstream, we will need Banks that can manage peoples Bitcoin for them.
Unless economic natural selection sounds good?

I don't have any opinions on the US financial system, which is what I assume you are referring.

You have made a good point sir.

Except next generation banking systems will take under a minute to settle. Goes live in Australia in under a year.

I disagree, see 
Go live is in about a year.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:08:40
Yeah I’m not familiar with the full situation in Europe, only what we’re doing down here. I agree with you assessment, but disagree with OP that Bitcoin on the Blockchain will make transactional banking look like the post.

Good luck drawing a bitcoin, will that be written in HEX or Binary?

I wrote an email alert system in node.js for my own purposes. Was more complicated than it would have needed to be if I had used chain's webhooks.
@_date: 2014-12-28 12:12:20
Just updated my node. Its running nicely.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:01:47
I understand this logic, and yes, bitcoind and bitcoin-qt are client software that communicate with and on the bitcoin network using the bitcoin protocol, but that client software is called "Bitcoin core". As another example similar to this, can you install BitTorrent? Yes, 
This is just semantics, and I'm happy to agree to disagree. The original implementation of the software is called the same thing as the technology itself. In the future I would expect installing bitcoin to mean installing *any* compatible node software.

Looks like its back to normal! (coinjar.com not updated yet, but their API has)

@_date: 2014-07-03 08:41:25
I would do it. If I hadn't already spend all I could on coins last week, I would be buying right now. The price is not dropping, its slowing going up as people buy.
@_date: 2014-07-03 10:12:36
Let me know how that goes. I might transfer a few mBTC out to my other wallet and see if that goes through.
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:05:38
I agree with you.
@_date: 2014-10-18 09:30:34
I didn't think this was correct, there is another ATM being run by a small consultancy company in the CBD. I'll look for an authoritative source.

Your right, I should move it all to my personal wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:18:07
They at least acknowledge that you may not have a clue who is at the other end of a bitcoin address. I'm wondering if business are going to have yo register their addresses they use for sales to help the ATO track GST.

Reading that, makes me think my local RPC calls will forward up to my VPS, but will it still update the blockchain on my local machine?
@_date: 2014-07-03 12:21:24
Its not getting any better either. Buy got down to AUD$622. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 11:12:57
As a person very familiar with the technical aspects of Bitcoin, I would like to correct you and say that you can indeed "install Bitcoin". 
That said, a normal person should not do this, and use a wallet like mycelium like you suggested.
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:11:35
Just wanted to let you know I successfully transferred over 1BTC from CoinJar Filler to my personal wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:06:04
Very fair point.
@_date: 2014-11-11 11:31:38
People who run Bitcoin nodes would generally be technically minded and do so for a purpose. A non technical user shouldn't need to download the 25GB+ block chain to use Bitcoin. This is my opinion, but I believe its valid.
I run a Bitcoin node because I use it for research and education.
@_date: 2014-12-05 11:44:31
I agree with this. The better our government treats bitcoin the faster it's adoption here, and the better my bitcoin related job prospects.
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:56:45
More crazy price movement. 
Buy dropped to AUD$629
@_date: 2014-07-03 08:44:15
Best guess so far is someone sold a heap, and their pricing engine has adjusted automatically to sell them off.

"CoinJar FairRate pricing is inaccurate due to a bug in our pricing engine. This issue has been addressed. All transactions conducted over the window are honoured."
Well at least now we have our answer. Thanks Asher!

Wish I knew this before I developed my entire app using Blockchain.info :(
@_date: 2014-07-03 10:33:15
I cant transfer out... "The page you were looking for doesn't exist."
I have had this issue before with other parts of their website. Can anyone else confirm if they can or cannot transfer out?
EDIT: Worked in IE. *sigh* Waiting for confirmation.

I do not believe they show their order book. If you find it, I would love to know.

Edit: Choose your poison.
@_date: 2014-07-03 08:29:33
I got the same impression that they are using USD for AUD prices. I have contacted them to find out more.
@_date: 2014-07-29 03:24:27
not 
@_date: 2014-07-03 12:50:35
Your using coinjars buy price but not their sell price for your calculations right? Your site says buying $100 of bitcoin would be worth more than $100.
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:24:58
8:40PM and 9:12PM AEST is when I got my coins out. Instantly had a unconfirmed transaction on my wallet, and confirmed in a few minutes. I also saw the price go back up to normal and then drop again. I'm watching the price every 10 seconds now.

I know you are probably being sarcastic, but that's not what censorship is.


@_date: 2017-03-18 14:31:24
I believe it's the number of blocks mined, which is loosely tied to their hashrates.
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:04:04
No. For example if you assume the word list is 256 words long, that means it's 8 bits of seed per word, so it's a 24*8 = 192 bit seed. This is a simplification, read the standard for actual technical details.

Software defined database.... So a database.
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:53:08
I still think its worth bringing awareness to this issue, despite actuality being far from likely.
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:41:12
Fair point, but if it was recognized...
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:53:37
This potentially has huge tax implications for Australia, it would change Bitcoin from being an asset to a foreign currency. That assumes they adopt bitcoin and not an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-05 10:17:46
It's a hotly debated topic. It's extremely unlikely the block every 10 minutes will change as that's the rate that miners are rewarded. My favorite suggestion was a gradual block size increase calculated in a repeatable way just like the block difficulty is.
@_date: 2015-03-28 08:20:47
I really just need a unique representation that's easy to understand is multisig.
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:35:25
Its clearly sounds like a phishing attach that tricked users to authorize a malicious application. It in no way suggests there was any vulnerabilities in their infrastructure. It does however sound like a staff member may have granted the malicious application its API key in the first place.
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:28:23
So in the case of multi-sig, I could just treat the group of addresses as one unique entity, right? The value isn't split between the multiple individual addresses, it can only reside in that multi-sig combination. However I guess each individual address could also be used by itself or in other multi-sig combinations elsewhere on the block chain.
Now I just need to figure out a nice way to represent that other than an addresses.join('-')
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:11:37
I like bitcoin. Currently making nice loses. Ba.id.au/bitcoin

As someone who has taught law enforcement about Bitcoin, I can say they certainly need it!
