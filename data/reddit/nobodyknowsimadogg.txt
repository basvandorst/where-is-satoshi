Ummmm..... I really can't tell if this is sarcasm.....

It doesn't really make any difference. In Zimbabwe a millions dollars is nothing and in England during the 1700's a pound was a years wage (well, something like that anyway).
I'm not aware of any major difficulty with expressing these values in either case.

Worth noting that it's on a logarithmic scale too.

So how is presenting a practical solution for this problem propaganda?
The top comment in the link you've provided even says that renewable energy is the answer.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:49:11
Sorry, what is propaganda in this article exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:10:03
But the solution in the article *doesn't reduce bitcoins energy consumption*. It just draws it from renewable sources instead. It's a good thing.
I think you're the one who doesn't understand.

Market cap of about $1.5M.
Plenty of room for growth!

I didn't really do that though, what I said was "*If* people are falling for this on a large scale it's going to be a huge crash"
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:21:27
They must be panicing!!!
Now I am too!!

Yea, HODL memes have saved me so much money that, in a way, they sort of have a kind of intrinsic value.

Well cryptocurrencies get their value from what people are prepared to trade them for. Tether just seems to have been *assigned* a value.
Couldn't you just *assign* bitcoin a value of 50,000 and we can all retire? Of course not, it's ridiculous.
If people are falling for this on a large scale it's going to be a huge crash.

Can't you just transfer your bitcoins out to a wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:26:21
BTCC : $3606
OKCoin : $3643
Huobi : $2922
Bitstamp $3670
So yeah, Huobi is down a lot.

Is that how it works?
That'll be 23,000 doge please!

Problem is tax. I've cashed out enough to fill my tax free allowance. After that I'll have to pay Capitol Gains.
I suspect it it going to dip quite a bit but it's probably easier just to hodl the rest. I'd be looking to buy back in in later and ultimately to *spend* most of my coins on something potentially life changing in the future.

Well to be fair there was a contentious hard fork :(
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:41:39
And they're "printing" more and more of this stuff all the time.
This won't end well.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:30:25
What I don't get about this is if people are buying bitcoin with tether...... who the fuck is selling bitcoin for tether?
I wouldn't touch that shit with a ten foot barge pole.

I can't prove what's going on in an exchange but I'm not going to ignore it. Feel free to ignore it yourself.  We'll know more in the next month or so.

So like Tether except a million times better.
People are using Tether to trade out of crypto without creating a taxable event. If they are able to do the same with the crypto rouble it could be very useful for traders.

If it was incorrect you would have posted what the prices actually were but you didn't.
Here's the links so people can check for themselves.

It's still you I'm afraid.

There are more than 20 currencies called the "Dollar".
There's quite a few different pounds and francs out there too.
