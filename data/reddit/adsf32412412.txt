localbitcoins does have a feature where you can send the id info to them (ie, to the site operators) and then they'll mark your account as verified.. that usually means most sellers won't require further id since they trust localbitcoins's verification.

If you build up some reputation people stop asking for ID - so clearly it is not a requirement for them to always have ID on file for everyone.. there are no laws about this, it's just what makes people comfortable enough to start trading with a new partner.
Perhaps trust can be established by doing cash deposits for a few months before trying to do small bank transfers and moving up to larger ones.. all without any ID verification at all.
I guess that lbc verification helps establish trust.. is it enough by itself? It all depends on what your counterparty feels like doing. It's certainly alot better than an unverified account with no trades.. I do think someone would probably do a small trade with a new verified lbc account, but I guess I have not tested this. 
Once someone does a trade with you by bank transfer and verifies your name from the bank statement that also helps and again more traders will trust you. The more trusted your account is the less likely any particular trader is to bother about IDs.

It isn't so clear cut.. each trader sets their own policy.. there are traders in the UK that will trade with only the localbitcoins reference (without needing the ID on hand) - although perhaps not the specific one you were dealing with.

I'm just explaining how lbc works.. it's a plain and simple fact that sellers don't always check ID.. I have a fairly established account and it's now quite rare that I am asked for ID - even with new partners I have not traded with before.
Many of them explain on their 'buy' pages exactly what you need to have for them to most likely not ask for id (although sure if they are suspicious for some reason I guess they may still ask).. generally some combination of account age, number of trades, whether or not their name has been verified by a few other people the amount and I'm sure that JUMIO is taken into consideration as well.. really the only way to know if it works is to try it and I certainly can't be bothered for the sake of this argument.
I'm not aware of any age restrictions on bitcoin purchases in any country in the world. AML and KYC policies are applied voluntarily in the UK in order to try and maintain banking relationships and because they are useful to deter fraud, not because it's currently a legal requirement.

I'm loving the double standard; Russia blocks LBC - [LBC implements workarounds]( Germany bans LBC - LBC shuts down Germany.

Is it safe? I dunno.. is it normal, yes it is. If you look for cash deposit options instead of bank transfer there might be some that don't require ID. On the other hand, if you block out the bank card number and write stuff over the IDs like 'for whoever on localbitcoins' or something so it can't easily be reused for something else then it's probably no more dangerous than renting a hotel or a car - where they also normally take a photocopy of your id.

You could do it using sofort banking (basically you give your bank login credentials to this sofort company and they log into your online banking account and verify that you really sent the transfer). These exchanges work with sofort;
