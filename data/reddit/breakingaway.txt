To answer your question: the yields from increased output has gone disproportionately to the upper 20%.

Sure that's the reason for the increased output, I agree with that. But it's not the (primary) reason for the growing wealth inequality (which is a bigger than income inequality).

Surprisingly the way those gains have been captured hasn't really been through nefarious means. It's mostly little things, like education becoming more valuable in the last 50 years and so the children of the top 20% have the ability to provide better education opportunities for their children. Or as population grows, land becomes more valuable because there is, in the most literal sense of the word possible, a fixed pool of available land. So simply by owning land your wealth would increase, which again disproportionately benefits the top 20%.
I think its important to remember these type of things, because most people in this class don't think they're actively harming the lower 80% when they do things like contest zoning law reform etc... I dislike how reddit froths at the mouth about the evil 1%ers when in reality, its more of a systemic thing we should be allies in combating.

The fed loans to banks because they serve as the lender of last resort. Banks will literally borrow from any other option available before going to the fed because the fed has higher interest rates.
Or are you talking about the "federal reserves" banks are required by law to hold to require banks to maintain a certain percentage of liquidity? The reason those have interest rates is because it's how the fed tries to manage inflation vs unemployment. The fact that they only loan those to banks is because banks  are a very effective mechanism through which the fed can influence aggregate demand (fed raises or lowers their interest rates to banks, banks raise or lower their interest rates to customers, customers respond to higher/lower rates, tempering or bolstering aggregate demand). It's purely practical, and it's a very effective way to do it.

Agreed. 
To be fair, the Fed on the gold standard is very different than the Fed now. So that's not the best direct comparison.

Interesting. So how do you think the fed failed in its duties? Was it just the Greenspan years of leaving interest rates too low for too long?

Worked doing what?

thanks mr randy

My understanding is not as good as some, but 2007/2008 would have likely happened even with higher fed interest rates, just due to the questionable lending and underwriting practices. So if the fed kept interest rates too low, it just magnified the effects of the crash, but wasn't the direct reason for it. Is that what you're saying?

Nah, it's the difference between having a boss/manager micromanage everything you do and make sure you are allowed to do it, vs him checking up with you every couple of days.

The fed isn't a branch of the government, its independent. Did you mean the treasury?

Caused? No way, don't be obtuse.
Contributed? There's a reasonable argument to be made they contributed in some capacity.
Let's not go making stupid blanket statements.
