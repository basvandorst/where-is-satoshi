Timeline of a privacy thread on Bitcoin. 
--Those who care about privacy correct Bitcoin-facist or those ignorant of  best practices.
--Bye-bye front page.

Too simple....
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:31:12
Practical question: How would it be fungible if you can see it enter and exit the sidechain? Won't the entire sidechain become tainted?
@_date: 2015-06-20 03:52:16
It's just getting started:

And here's my favorite r/bitcoiner's new opinion:
@_date: 2015-05-25 10:06:36
Yeah, change your Bitcoins into a privacy coin or make the Bitcoin blockchain opaque--anything else and you're giving the world an Orwellian machine packaged with freedom wrapping paper. Buying a Guy Fawkes mask doesn't make you Guy Fawkes; you have to be Guy Fawkes before you put on the mask.

Why would a company want their payroll on a clear blockchain?
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:28:15
Here you go : )
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:17:32
Some of these companies (blasphemous heathens) were built to adapt in case Bitcoin isn't the one. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 07:10:20
You've got this, a fairly launched version of cryptonote (XMR, BBR, AEON), and perhaps anonymint's coin when that is released. 
Solutions with benefits and limitations set by the design they use, but all legitimate solutions.
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:47:53
I'd add a third class. As merchants are waiting for coins to be verified by analytical software, they might brown list coins until they can know  for certain if the coins are tainted or untainted.
@_date: 2015-09-26 05:13:57
Best answer I've found:
@_date: 2015-09-26 05:04:27
At the moment, it seems those that want a regulatory friendly Bitcoin have more power, so the "just a matter of time" mantra appears limp and chimerical--like a near sighted old man who keeps mistakenly taking his wife's provera for his ED.
@_date: 2015-09-26 03:04:04
 As long as Bitcoin are being mined, consumers will have access to clean coins. Don't be surprised when merchants say,  "If you want to transact in Bitcoin, there are clean coins available. Please use those as  we will not be accepting bitcoins with unverifiable or dubious pasts due to liability and regulatory concerns. We're sorry for any inconvenience...."
@_date: 2015-09-26 04:23:09
The difference is that most merchants don't check bills, and even if they did, they are obligated to take them as the bills are "legal tender." 
With Bitcoin the analytic software will analyze every expenditure and the merchant has no legal obligation to accept bitcoin as payment.

It's on the dash wiki, genius.
@_date: 2015-11-08 15:36:46
Most people disregard instamined coins whether the developer claims it was an accident or not.
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:44:13
Vulnerabilities were found by anonymint on the x11 algorithm (the breakage of one algo weakens them all) and dash has been criticized by Peter Todd as snakeoil and the professional code audit did cite vulnerabilities (so when you write no vulnerabilities, you are either misinformed or lying). The evolution plans, while verifying that even Evan realizes that non-protocol anonymity is second rate (or else why get rid of it?) also depends on the word of a man who instamined a coin and failed to relaunch and called it an accident--not exactly my first choice for trust. If there was some peer review, it would be a different story, but that doesn't seem the dash way.
As for Monero bloat, if dash had much of any use of darksend, then it to would have bloat effects. Monero is finalizing a db that will alleviate bloat effects in the future and that can be peer reviewed. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 17:10:59
Here's what anonymint said about x11
"If any one of the hashes in the chain of 11 hashes has a lower entropy then the entire chain does. Say you found this vulnerability and didn't announce it. Instead you could use it to amplify your hashrate. With that you could take unfair levels of mining rewards, or potentially launch double-spend attacks.
Fixing it after the fact also probably means the inability to unwind the damage already done if it had gone on a long time undetected.
So 11 hashes is 11 times more likely to have a vulnerability than 1 hash."
Snake oil salesmen can be hardworkers, so not sure why your analysis assumes otherwise. And judging by fruits gives me: an instamine, second rate anonymity, a faulty algo (if you believe anonymint more than a news service), and a decentralized goverance that puts the most power in the hands of those with the most coins (who were also likely part of the instamine). Not exactly an orchard worth bragging about.
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:07:05
I know what happened, but I think it's funny that ayone would accept the error "accident" story when Evan, the developer, could have just as easily relaunched the coin as he did earlier--instead of keeping his part of the 30% that were mined in those early hours--which would have been the action of an honest developer, not one trying to profit from a instamine without getting the label of premine. You can rationalize it however you want, but I for one don't like being made a fool of and won't accept such a clumsy explanation. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:34:25
How are you sending me tainted satoshis if you can't taint them? =p
@_date: 2015-10-24 06:15:18
My point is that it doesn't matter if you want to eliminate human perception from your definition of fungibility, because human perception influences the machinery enough that one satoshi has a different value than another--the evidence is that people are paying a premium for freshly minted satoshi. This cannot happen if Bitcoin has a fungibility equal to a physical coin. You can niggle all you want about how it's supposed to work, because it's working how it is working and no one can dispute that some satoshi are valued over others and vice versa--or did you miss what BTC-e did to the Evolution scammers? 
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:18:22
Yes, but that's detracting from the instamine and trying to derail the subject.
*I want protocol level anonymity not anonymity that depends on humans to operate nodes using best practices--which is the difference between Monero's anonymity and dash's.
@_date: 2015-10-24 15:07:23
They can perceive an address is tainted, which breaks fungibility for the coins associated with that address. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 03:06:18
Then why are people paying a premium for freshly mined coins? Your statement misses that the coin is forever tied to the address thus ruining the coins fungibility by proxy. It would be the same as if dollars were dna tested and your dna left a permanent mark on the dollar--your argument would be then, "The dollar is still a dollar it is the dna that is changed."  
As long as meta data can be linked to bitcoin addresses, one bitcoin can be priced differently, blacklisted, white listed, or brown listed. If this isn't a fungibility problem, what is?
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:33:33
Doesn't matter. I can still get myself blacklisted, white listed or brown listed by the association. 
What difference is there in digital money if the numerical reference is tainted or the thing that holds (is associated as holding) the numerical reference is tainted?
You're making a distinction that doesn't matter to the user. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 06:27:51
If someone wants to perceive a specific satoshi tainted, they can--and that's everything.  
Perfect fungibility means all of something is perceived tainted or none of something is perceived tainted. And while no coin can claim perfect fungibility, some can claim better fungibility than others. And it's not by accident that those with higher fungibility than BTC are more private than BTC. Privacy is a trait of fungibility and the more private a coin is the more fungible it is. Not sure why you are trying to separate this very obvious correlation, but good luck on your Quixotic journey.
@_date: 2016-07-06 04:52:06
Sybil. Also, sometimes people lose things to "prove" they don't have control--the point is that the instamine and masternode set-up makes an oligarchy easy. It was a stupid design if your intent was decentralization--the instamine just exasperates that fact. You're arguing that it's decentralized because no one can prove it is not and using circumstantial evidence to claim that it is decentralized. It's a "in the best of all outcomes" argument and hardly in the trustless spirit of cryptocurrency--best of luck with getting greater fools to buy into this chimerical BS. You won't be getting me or anyone else who understands that you design this shit out so it is easier to trust the coin is decentralized, not build it in and hope the coin's stewards are acting in an honest and open way. IE. you are asking me to trust the developers and not the design, which is as stupid as trusting the housing market 2008.
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:01:35
You're assuming  a lot to make your points, and since there is no way to prove your assumptions as facts, you have failed to make a worthwhile point. The biggest assumption that you've made is that votes and exchange information have not been manipulated to create a narrative (rather than actuality) that dash's original instamined coins have been redistributed and are not collecting fees and garnering more power into the hands of a few--anyone who has followed traditional markets understands market manipulation and will not be naïve enough to believe they are not being manipulated when it behooves certain people to in fact manipulate them for a material or a power gain--I'm not trusting your chimerical assertions anymore than I would trust the mortgage industry in 2008.

I'm sure your cognitive dissonance is at full-bore and inventing scenarios why I'm not correct, so I'll leave you to your delusions and make better use of my time, good luck.
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:57:49
Dude, what are you smoking? If you mine 2 million coins in a couple of days and then incentivize a payout on your nodes, you are creating a opportunity for people to just keep on buying nodes with their payouts and increasing their holdings--and you're throwing voting rights on top of it? That's a prime breeding ground for an oligarchy. I'll take what you're smoking, but you can keep your magic monarchy money

^ I once heard someone try to spin smoking related deaths as saving money on a nation's long term health care costs--that was horrible, this is funny.

Now I wonder if anyone will peer review his solution to the current anonymity that he says is inadequate?
