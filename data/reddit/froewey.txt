In reality, 21 million of anything doesn’t mean much if it can be broken into smaller pieces and still be useful.
By the time we start using satoshis more often we will now have 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis.

“No income tax” 
Aren’t capital gains lumped in as a form of income tax?

Yup.  Fuck the ICO journal.  They were caught blackmailing philakone.  They told him he had to retweet and share all their posts otherwise they would start a smear campaign against him.  Unscrupulous shits

Surely then you have to ask.... why hasn’t he done this already?

Fair comment

If you’re a BTC maximalist, you don’t really understand the use case of some altcoins because you choose not to see it, simple as that.

How did reversing the transaction put you at -$19k?    Did you spend the money that was put in the account even though you knew it wasn’t yours?

Nah they don’t come like this.  I ordered three ledger nanos from the company which all arrived in shrink wrap.  It is not a security feature and it’s something that could be easily recreated after tampering though.  It’s just weird that OP’s nano doesn’t have any wrapping

I never ate a mushroom pizza but I drank a whole lot of mushroom shakes in Thailand.  They were most definitely real shrooms and I had a great time, every time.   I feel like shrooms would be cheaper and easier to obtain than pretending and giving out meth or some other crap.    
In Thailand on the full moon beach I remember having some amazing trips.  The moon reflection on the waves and the fire dancers down on the beach.  It was truly amazing.

They do come in plastic wrap.
I’ve had 3 sent to me from the company which all came in shrink wrap.  It doesn’t add any security but it definitely makes me wonder why OP’s doesn’t have any wrapping.

I hope you have a great time!   It’s quite the adventure over there
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:36:56
Nah they do come in a plastic wrapping.  It’s a common misconception related to the fact that Ledger say there is no tamper proof seal or anything.  It’s not tamper proof but they do come wrapped in clear plastic wrapping.  I’ve had 3 of them sent to me from Ledger

I’ve done shrooms many times and it’s usually around 4 hours for me.   Acid more like 6-10 hours in my experience. 
The mushroom shakes were the perfect amount to have a great trip. One full moon party we went back three times so we were tripping for about 12 hours until the sun came up.  Such an amazing time.  I remember we bought a full grilled fish from a bbq guy in the middle of the night and thought we would set it free in the ocean.  I fully expected it to swim away ��
I know what you mean though and these days I’m less likely to want to do shrooms in such a crowded place,  but all of the lights and music and fire made for such a beautiful, interesting trip. We were all in amazement at everything and spent a lot of the nights in hysterics. 
Even more of a spectacle was the black moon party in the jungle.  They had a nightclub style set up in the trees and neon fluorescent colours and glow in the dark paint.  A very popular style of dance music there is Psytrance - not my favourite - but it was very fitting for the scene and the mushrooms.

We only drank that day as we didn’t think drugs and rivers would mix well.    I am a decent swimmer and my fitness level was good at the time so I decided not to take a tube and to swim from bar to bar.  
 It was wet season and the river was wild.  It had undercurrents which sucked you to the centre of the river then pulled you down.   The guys on the next bar would throw you a rope but if you missed it you had to try and stop at the next bar.   I missed the rope and got pulled under. Swallowed a lot of water and genuinely felt scared for my life. I  would definitely advise everyone to take a tube with them!    
The water I swallowed was most likely what made me feel sick for the next couple weeks.  I felt like I was turning into a vampire because sunlight in my eyes felt like someone was sticking my head in a vice.    
I learned a lot of life lessons on that trip haha

It sure was.  Pretty much all of the bars/restaurants in the small town sell drugs.  Just ask for the happy menu if you want to check it out (opium, mushrooms, weed) .  There’s an understanding between the cops and the bars that they can sell you drugs but you have to consume the drugs in the establishment.  If you get caught with drugs outside on the street I don’t want to imagine how badly it would go for you.

�� what?!

Well as I said, I have had 3 direct from the source and they always had plastic wrap, most recently in January.  The information on Ledger’s site says they stopped putting the grey sticker on there but it doesn’t go into any detail about plastic wrapping, so I don’t know where you’re getting this info from.  Seems like you’re the one spreading misinformation.  I didn’t suggest it wasn’t safe anyway,  i was just pointing out that it was different from what I’d seen.
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:27:56
I have purchased 3 ledger nanos direct from the company and they all had a sealed plastic wrapping.   Not “tamper proof” but still covered in a wrapping to show it’s new.  It’s strange that OP’s doesn’t have it
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:37:37
Possibly yeah.  I’m just going with my own experiences with It 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:48:44
Smoked opium, drank buckets of medical grade red bull and cheap rum, nearly drowned in river, developed crushing headaches and blinding sensitivity in my eyes for 10 days from a bug I caught in the filthy river.    10/10 would revisit
