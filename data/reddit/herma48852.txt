NEVER give your private keys to anyone. Buy BTC on the dip and never sell (called HODL). Its really as easy as that. And get a hardware wallet (I prefere the Ledger Nano S) to store you coins. When there is a big correction and you start to panic, come to this reddit for support to help you get through it. And stay away from the other coins as its pretty much impossible to out perform a dedicated BTC HODL-er.

The problem with that is trust. Although annoying at first, having just completed building a rpi3 full node myself a week ago, building bitcoind directly from github is far  more satisfying and eliminates having to trust that a 3rd party may have compromised the install.

Sounds about right. The google cloud full node I set up prior to the rpi3 one in progress only took 4 days to fully sync. The difference being 5GB RAM vs only 1GB.

Okay, here is my naive way of explaining how tainting works:
Tainting allows one to create a transaction with two inputs:  a pre fork UTXO (unspent output) and one with UTXO from after the fork. The use-case I'm most interested in is to sell my free B2X coins as soon as they are available. To do this I will need to buy a little bit of B2X coin, call it B2X dust,  that was created after the fork (by B2X miners). So when I sell both together in one transaction, the B2X I got for free and the B2X dust I purchased, this transaction cannot be replayed on the BTC chain since B2X dust does not exist on it even though the "cloned BTC" B2X coin does exist on it. 
My understanding is that Chainspl.it will make the purchasing of the B2X dust and the combining of cloned B2X and dust into one transaction as easy as possible.

Essentially use of public addresses (strings of numbers and letters)  makes a transaction anonymous,
 no address owner information (name, SSN, etc)  is stored with the transaction, only the addresses and the amounts of btc transferred. Where as with CT, in addition, its probabilisticly  impossible to determine the amounts transferred in the transaction.
This is HIGHLY technical work and for anyone doubting the talent we are so fortunate to have developing bitcoin, please spend a few months trying to learn the fundamentals to get through this paper. Note I saw from the twitter thread mentioned here that this is already implemented in a separate repo with a table of significant advantages over the privacy oriented alts.

My gcloud full node is now up and running with 17 connections: Huge thanks to for all his effort in making this available to the masses. 
The biggest error I made was not increasing the 10GB default boot disk size to the recommended 180GB (I actually rounded up to 200GB) when creating my vm instance.  Instead I created an separate 200GB disk , attached it but loaded the bitcoind daemon and my node kept crashing. Guessing this was the issue, I  started over by detaching the disk, deleting it and then deleting the vm instance. After that experience, it was much easy the second time around to recreate my instance (selecting Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS with the enlarged boot disk);  it took about 3.5 days to complete syncing.
There was a little confusion following the instructions PPA repo instructions at   as it specifies version 0.14 which in reality was 0.15 as verified with the "bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo". 
The following two commands where of great use to me in helping triage:
1. To check how many total blocks in the blockchain I used "wget -q -O-  echo". 
2. For checking how many blocks my node had sync-ed I used "bitcoin-cli -conf=/u0/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf getblockcount".

Okay I think I see whats going on (been a long time since I looked at this stuff):
Only when C = abG (for only exactly half of the 128), the two items below are the same:
e(A,B) = e(aG, bG) = e(G, bG)^a  = (e(G,G)^a)^b = e(G,G)^ab
 
e(G,C)= e(G,abG) = e(G,G)^ab
where e(G,G) is an n-th root of unity, n order of the group generated by G.
Very clever test as CSW never has to produce his bilinear pairing to detect the paired lines.

which discusses a very promising technique for both significant reduction the size of the blockchain together with a strong form of privacy (only the current set of unspent outputs are verified without revealing the inputs), however is  there is no mention of POW changes or how this addresses mining centralization.

Yes, I run core on it. Although the instructions here,  are a bit outdated they are adequate to get you up and running.  Note that by default the ./configure command does not build a wallet. You will need to replace the "--disable-wallet" at the end of the command with the "--with-incompatible-bdb" option in order to build the wallet correctly. Also I used the suggested "--dbcache=50" when starting the bitcoind daemon to sync the blockchain; otherwise it would keep hanging after the first 100000 or so blocks. It did crash a few times and had to be restarted during the sync process but be patient and eventually it will sync within a week.

I'm not giving up as I have faith that the developers, with the support of the community, create something more resilient and in particular miner hashrate attach immune.
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:15:20
This appears to be more complicated then these instructions indicate (at least for someone like myself with limited experience and time to work on this).  
On my Google Compute web-interface there are no tabs, just drop down menus associated with a list of choices down the right side column (e.g. "Billing", "APIs", "App Engine", "Compute Engine"). I did find a "VM Instance" menu choice under  "Compute Engine" (not VM) and created an Ubuntu 1vPC with 3GB default memory which defaulted with a boot disk of 10GB (this took 4 attempts as it keep failing to complete the creation with an unknown error.) 
For disk creation, I choose 200GB for its size. It also required a choice of "Source Image" for which I just chose the first one called "centos-6-v20170918" not understanding what this means.
Then I really really got stuck as there is no choice for details section under my instance and no "Network Interfaces" choice. There is a "Network Services" choice with a right column entry which produces another page with a right hand column entry titled "VPS Services". I selected it and I get a generic message about compute engines. 
I also found "Firewall rules"  which appears as a choice on the same page but when selecting it I get the generic message about compute engines again.
It’s possible you may have created your full node quite a while ago when these instructions corresponded to an earlier web design.
Accordingly I'm going to have to abort this attempt and go back to offering just moral support to all those like yourself that are running full nodes. Although I wasn’t successful I am now more than ever interested in installing a full node on my own hardware.
I do appreciate the effort you made in creating this post, and I am sure there will be many others who will be successful in working through the instructions.
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:18:03
I splurged with an rpi3 and a 256GB micro SD card; good to last for a few years of running a full node at least. Only another 140,000 blocks to go. I did run into a number of problems in setting it up but all of them were already addressed on the various forums (stack-exchange, bitcoin.org, etc.).
