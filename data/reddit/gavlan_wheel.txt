Why don't companies like Coinbase, Bitpay, Overstock, etc. invest some money into mining rigs? 
Getting legit businesses into the mining arena would be the best thing that ever happened to Bitcoin.

Which is insane. The average person has no clue how inflation works, how much of it we have or why we have it. Even if we were deflating at the same rate, around 2%, nothing would change.

Like I said above, that is not an option for him. Too much to lose and too many people that hate him with way too much money.

Why? 
Don't they make insane money off of owning the payment processor Paypal?
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:30:34


It's not. 
But after the elite and the government repeating the lie for over a hundred years, it becomes the truth.

A lot of what you said just isn't true. China had a massive fleet at one point but decided to burn them than explore the world. 
What you said is the basis for the book, "Gun, germs and steel" which tries to explain every single difference in races as something that occurred in the environment. 
No one legitimate thinks that humans are born of 100% environment. 
There are two great books you should check out:
Explains why some races are better at certain sports than others.
Nicholas Wade, the liberal New York Times science reporter puts together a book about genes and their significance to humans.

Well he said global debt, not US debt before unfunded liabilities. 
With how many people just in the US living paycheck to paycheck and the billions of super poor in the world, it's believable to me. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 04:23:38
Yup. 
The politicians love fiat though, since it allows them to spend more than they have and then make the debt worth less through inflation. 
I think a big part of the reason why no politician is concerned about the US national debt is because they know that the Fed will keep buying it and the Fed will keep inflating the money supply making the debt less.

Then you shut down the IRS and institute a flat sales tax? Seems like that would be the easiest way to collect tax under a mainstream bitcoin economy. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 03:24:01
There is the federal budget for you. 
What is really funny is the projected income tax reciepts. They expect to double it from 1.3 trillion to 2.7 trillion in 10 years. 
So either we are about to all get high paying jobs or they are going to start taxing the hell out of everyone. You figure that one out.

1. Buy tens of thousands of dollars worth of mining equipment
2. Get rewarded for mining in bitcoins
3. Destroy your only way of making money
Foolproof plan. How can I get in on it?

You wont become rich, but since the money is worthless, you would be worth more. 
What said is correct. The rich come out on top with inflation since they own so many assets. 2% of millions or billions of dollars a year is a lot of loss. Which is why they own as many assets as they can. 1% of people own 50% of all stocks in the US.


Socialism can work in small homogenous European countries. I have no problem with that. But thinking that inflation will cure inequality is pretty nutty.

Jewish woman. 


The last three heads of the Federal Reserve have been Jewish, who make up 1.8% of the United States. Jews are also disproportionately represented in billionaires, CEOs and entrants to the IVY league. 
Not that I'm into the whole Jewish conspiracy bit, but there is a reason such sentiment exists.

The government actually adopting Bitcoin has it's currency would actually benefit the country right now. Since Bitcoin is more stable than it's peso, especially in the long term, the smart choice would be Bitcoin. 
It also makes the government look like they are more in control than they actually are. If they were to adopt the dollar as their official currency, it would make them look weak. Especially when they would be essentially giving all power to the USA to have control over their money.

Except that kids who go to the top schools are not your typical kids. 
Their families tend to be upper middle class or higher. Hell, even 2/3s of minority students who go to the IVY league are upper middle class. 
So 100 dollars is probably trivial to a lot of them.

This sub has gone to shit. Why am I even still subbed here? 
Is there a better crypto sub on Reddit? 
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:18:04
No, but you can change what people think about them. 
There are still millions of supporters of communism, you can see them on Reddit and when they mention it, they don't get many downvotes. All of the propaganda about communism still works on weak minds.

I only own 1 bitcoin, but I hold it on Coinbase. 
2FA and me not being stupid on my computer with downloading 500 bitcoin related applications makes me feel pretty secure. I also do the standard security stuff like a good password and virus scans. 
If I held a substantial number of bitcoins, I would probably hold them in cold storage. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 03:55:28
I would recommend buying a small amount for use. 
Once you start sending and spending bitcoins, you start to get a feel for just how awesome it is.

Peter Schiff is a really smart guy. He understands Bitcoin completely. 
That is why he rails against it so hard. When your business is selling precious metals, you don't support your direct competitor. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:48:11
That actually makes the case for Bitcoin. 
Those were privately held, stupid currencies that made no sense. But even then, VCs were convinced that a digital currency was the future. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:50:11
How will the US pay for [129 trillion in liabilities]( if it doesn't debase it's money? 
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:11:02
This is 100% correct. 
When setting up a cold storage address, you need to test it with small amounts to make sure everything is working properly before doing the "real" thing. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:18:42
How about bitcorn?
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:32:01


It didn't. The government colluded with private banks to be able to create currency out of thin air.

You want to see real inequality? Try a communist country. Inequality has become a new buzzword, even though in the west our inequality is a joke compared to most other countries. 


What? Maybe if we had hyperinflation, since we would all be poor. Inflation helps the rich much more than the poor, since the rich own more assets. 
Stop listening to your communist economics professors. They are obviously insane.
@_date: 2014-05-12 01:18:15
Thank you Satoshi for staying hidden. 
This proves what a smart move it was. Just one allegation of "child xxxxxx" (doesn't matter, think of the children!!!) and no one would take bitcoin anymore. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:02:37
Well the US is about 17 trillion in debt and if you add in unfunded liabilities, it gets ridiculous. 
I just noticed they also will show you every state and how much they are in debt. It doesn't surprise me very much, since it seems like every major city is on the verge of becoming another Detroit. 
So yeah, counting governments, I completely believe that guys number.

Do you want to spend your Bitcoin or use it in any fashion at all? Just use your Coinbase account, buy Bitcoin and use 2FA. Also run a virus scan and be careful about downloading browser extensions and addons. 
Do you want to have a large amount or just put it away until it reaches the moon? Then use the offline wallet that other people are talking about.

Look at his name. Look at his comments.

More like when corporations realize that they can make 2-4% more money by people using crypto instead of credit cards. That translates into millions of dollars for most big corporations. 
Who will do the mining? The corporations will. The money they will save from ditching credit cards is so huge that it's many times cheaper to do the mining and not charge fees for transactions. 
Not only that, but the corporations will have a huge interest in expanding the network and making sure no one can disrupt it. Who cares if many corporations together will have 90%+ of the hashing power when any sort of attack they would do would only be destroying their own way of making money.

He is mostly worried about 1099-MISC which you have to fill out every time someone makes a donation of 600 dollars or more. But I'm not sure what he has to do for many tiny donations. None the less, he is worried about doing it 100% correctly and was worried that bitcoins would cause a complication.
@_date: 2014-05-30 01:06:45
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of quality discussion about Bitcoin goes on in a subreddit called "Buttcoin". 
They are just trolls who are such losers that they are obsessed with something they hate.
