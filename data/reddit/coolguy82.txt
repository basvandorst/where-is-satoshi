Yeah, as long as the worldwide ledger doesn't need to record more than 7 transactions a second.

They have fairly onerous verification requirements.
I'd rather not submit my passport/drivers license to some third party website.

Thank you for responding!
This is a really specific question, and I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't know -- what do purchases from them code as? "General"?
I'm also disappointed that they don't seem to state the price on their website, and it doesn't look like they take AmEx. Do they take PayPal?

I'd be buying with AmEx, and I'm guessing they'd also code it as a cash advance.
My guess: Circle codes as "Financial services" or something like that, which means that it's a cash-advance.

I should've explained myself better -- don't most of these website ask you for your billing address so that they can verify that with the CC company?
Besides, I don't see how a DL would be proof that I myself bought the coins. If someone stole my wallet, they'd have my CC and driver's license.
NB: I'm not planning on defrauding any sites.

Thanks for responding!
I might consider buying $10 from circle to test the waters.
I've heard pretty consistent reports (on this subreddit) of people getting charged CA fees.

Thanks for looking into it.
Unfortunately, it looks like they don't service WI in any case.

I don't want to eat the PP fees.
I'll be honest -- the real reason I'm trying to do this is to hit the minimum spend on my credit card to get the bonus miles.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:42:25
I suppose you're right, but they'd have my name and address.
I don't see how having my driver's license as well would help them.
@_date: 2015-01-26 00:30:27
Still doesn't add up.
If my credit card was stolen I would be held responsible until I reported it as well.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:43:43
Thanks for the suggestion!
I should've specified that I'm from the US, specifically in Wisconsin.

Shut the fuck up shill.
3 transactions per second should be enough for anyone.

So you're saying Bitcoin is more traceable than cash?
get the fuck out of here, statist shill
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:11:03
No, the US is behind it.
You don't get to be global hegemon by being behind the curve.
