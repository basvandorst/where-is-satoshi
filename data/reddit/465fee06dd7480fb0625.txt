How do I even pronounce it? I suggest mtgox's securitygate or something.

So what's the most robust checksum/hashing algorithm? SHAsomething?

Encrypt it with good security and save it in the cloud. FileVault, Crashplan and Dropbox is a way to go.

Nobody will ever run out of execuses to blame somebody.

It's going to sit next to AMEX. It needs major facelift or else it's going to look like cheap and nerdy.

Asrock H67DE motherboard has two PCIe x16 and three PCIe x1 slots.
You say x1 slots can take x16 cards with adapters, but isn't the whole point of having 16 lanes instead of 1 were so that you can have optimal bandwidth for video cards? Wouldn't using x16 cards on x1 seriously undermine the Mhash/s rate?
If I really can do that, I can connect 4 more 6990s with extra power supply....

FileVault. Now I need the wallet to be copied encrypted to dropbox every now and then...

I don't like MtGox's stance. If bitcoin is going to have any value other currencies can't offer, it'll be freedom. It doesn't have to be all about drugs, but they shouldn't be wagging tails to the authority. That's exactly the opposite of what they should be doing.

Great thing about bitcoin is it is not taxable.

What happens if PSU seriously lacked in quality?

I'll trust the .sparsebundle encryption.

Good thing is my 6990 will hold good resale value for a quarter.
