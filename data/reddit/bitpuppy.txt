Don't be mislead by this ploy.
Democracynow.org is not a democratic organization: it is strictly top-down.
I donated cash to democracynow.org about a decade ago, being as enthusiastic as many of you newbies are now.
But then, when I tried to provide constructive feedback to democracynow.org, I never received even an automated email acknowledgement of my input, let alone any kind of bottom-up online forum. Not to this day.
It seems, bless her soul, Amy Goodman, as executive producer, strictly controls democracynow, from the top-down, according to a long out-dated false "left-right" paradigm that no longer applies [as if it ever did].
Thus they lurch now, seemingly, toward bitcoin.
But where has democracynow.org ever criticized the Federal Reserve? Banking monopoly? The right to self-ownership, including the right to sell your own labor, tax free?
Doesn't exit. The only right you have is to sell yourself to some kind of "union", which is under the thumb of the gang with the most guns.
Oh, did I mention that democracynow.org is consistently committed to denying an individual the right to bear arms for self-defense?
Well, almost. They applauded it, recently, in interviews with some old ex-Black Panthers. 
How quaint.
But if any person who is not considered a "person-of-color", today, suggests any kind of armed self-defense, democracynow.org will have at least a half-hour interview with Mark Potok - the go-to guy, for labelling purposes.
I do believe that democracynow.org is well intentioned.
The only problem is that they are paving the road to hell with their woefully uninformed and biased "good intentions"
