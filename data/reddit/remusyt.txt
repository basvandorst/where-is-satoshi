True, but still that would be a $500 profit. :D Few times it dropped so much that it didn't get back to where it was for long times from what I've seen, but if you do quick buys/sells in hours/days I think it's doable, risky, but doable.

Not yet, I'll check it out, made accounts on localbitcoin, coinbase(but it does not work in my country) and kraken so far. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:01:47
You don't think it will drop after this sudden increase? :D
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:03:46
Oh, I see. Ok, thanks, I've made an account and submitted for Tier 2 verification! :D 
Too bad you can't use PayPal in most sites but I'll transfer my money to a bank account to try it I think, but strange that I don't have an USD deposit option, only EUR and some other currencies.

Haha, maybe.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:49:09
Yeah I have thought about that too, but I think I can manage the stress. :D Still, it mostly goes up and down a bit every day, have you ever tried doing it in super small timeframs? I see it sometimes going up and down hundreds in just a few hours.

Saw Kraken mentioned a few times as well, I'll sign up and check it out too soon, but if it's slow for trading that might be a problem! :)

I'll probably give it a shot once I find a good website to trade fast on, but won't start with too much, try with 0,xx bitcoins and see how it works, so I don't lose too much if I fail. :)

Well, if it does not work I'll buy, hold and use cryogenics and come back in a few years. =)
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:10:30
Maybe I'll outshark the sharks! =)
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:35:08
Hmm, good points! :) I've seen some people suggest coinbase since it's the fastest buy/sell website, but it's not working in my country yet, I've made an account on localbitcoins as well, would this work there? Can you instantly buy/sell? :D
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:59:31
I'll tell you for 1%. =)
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:33:01
But why?  if you look at it even daily, there are always spikes, you buy when it's low and wait for it to go back up, if it does not fast, you keep it and sell when it eventually does. :D
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:08:25
Ah, interesting. :D
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:00:16
I know, just wondered if you can instantly exchance it for money, found this site:  but I still don't get for sure how you can "move" it from the wallet there, you just use the wallet app like a bank account/paypal? :D
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:02:05
Yep I've been there, still not 100% sure about some things though. :D
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:32:05
Of course not, but it goes up and down pretty much every day, so you want for a drop and wait for it to go higher again  won't that work? :D
