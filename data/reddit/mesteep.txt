He always has when it suits him. Basically his mind is Bitcoin = Facebook = ant-Trump and therefore must be dealt with.

It hasn't; hell he should be thanking Facebook "fake news" shared on social media really helped boost Trump's 2016 chances. He and his supporters just get mad when Facebook bans you for saying racist or violent shit and blaming it on Facebook "censoring" Conservatives.
Edit if you want another example,  trump going after Amazon on Twitter because Amazon's owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns Washington Post which runs news pieces that he doesn't like.

Beyond the usual lack of sense in Trump tweets, it's probably less about crypto as a whole and more about "hurting" the creator of Libra because Trump perceives Facebook as an enemy to trump (he did have earlier today a bunch of right wing social media personalities at the WH complaining about "censorship" on social media platforms including Facebook) so this is squarely a shot at Facebook. Trump's MO has usually been if he sees you as anti trump or simply in the way he will try to find ANY leverage he can. He would force Facebook under federal regulations just so one of his cronies can kill it purely out of spite.

Ding ding! This tweet happened after the "social media" aka conspiracy and alt-right white house meet and greet for a reason. This is 100% just flailing at crypto because  "liberal" Facebook has one.

This is basically Trumpy taking a swipe at Facebook and not giving a fuck. This is who he is he will try destroy Bitcoin (haha) to spite Facebook's crypto.
