Thanks for the contribution, Captain Obvious.
But the US Federal Reserve declared Bitcoin to be proprety, not currency.
Therefore, this law might not be universal in terms of trade laws. One state might prosecute it, and one accept it as a commodity and overlook the laws. Bitcoin is not "money" in the eyes of the state.

You have no idea how a small contribution can change winds.
What if the EFF never received small chip-ins?
Thank you for helping Pascal's cause &lt;3~

Do *you* like the government?
There is a lot being quoted from the website too.
Facts are being moved away from opinions in the many sources I gave away.
Everyone has their view and prejudgment on different issues ;D.

Here is a video of the arrest:
The attorneys also explain why they believe that this was unjust, and why the government is fighting about it.

He *DID NOT* go with the deal.
He clearly refused *EVERYTHING* that included illegal activities.
If you took the time to read the case report and what I wrote, you would have understood that.
And that's why the charges against Pascal are not justified or accompanied with proof, because there is none.
And before you call someone a "*dumbass*", which is just rude, do some research on the person itself: 
He's a well educated, active and community-wise guy. What is being brought against him is based on false evidence and case report flaws.

Sorry about that ;c

While I am a Reddit sociopath sometimes, I'm active on many levels ;D.
Here's my website: 
I thought this was the place to post about it, and I happened to already have my old Reddit account.
Bear with me, as I'm trying to make the news report including Pascal's mom available to you.
Also, I'm pretty sure hiring a web designer when you're broke is a bit meh-ish.

You don't have to donate anything.
I have mentionned the link because it also contains more information on the case, which I thought people interested in the subject would like to have.
Also, the lawyers costs a lot of $$$, around 25k per month to be precise. Try to have a job when the cops are tracking your every move. It's extremely hard to find such an amount when you are being tied. 
Just talking about it is enough &lt;3.

Then how would people obtain Bitcoins in an unobtrusive way?
Exchanging currency is not reserved to banks.
The person giving Bitcoins needs something in exchange ;P.

Oh please, you didn't even take the time to read the case correctly to understand that he isn't liable for anything, as far as we know.
If you really don't care, then please don't downvote and assume that everyone has the same judgment and perception of the case. (・∀・)

Pascal was your average Bitcoin Trader, which is nothing illegal.
The Secret Services only targeted him because he had many transactions going on at a time.
All of what I said is based on facts and statements of what is currently available to study.
He never engaged in black market activity, nor did he ever condone or encourage it. I stated that he was innocent because every piece of  information available at the time contains no proof that could lead to the actual charges.

Do you think you could manage asking TVA for the report to be posted on YouTube or shared with you?
I think it's another important part of better understanding your case.

*gives passports*
*gives birth certificate*
If you need a dik pic, just ask ;D.
