Probably not going to be popular answer...but yes. You don’t have to worry about a wallet &amp; or losing your keys. I personally have both. I use RH for short-term investing (buying/selling) and other major exchanges for hodling into hardware devise.

Your bank transfer has to clear before you can withdraw (usually takes 3-5 days).....You can buy instantly but you’re not allow to withdraw right away

You are not really buying bitcoin...you’re buying a “synthetic” bitcoin...therefore you can’t move it out of RH....if you’re looking to invest buy/sell then RH is your app.

I use RH for short term investing...while it has no “exchange fees”, the spread is a lot higher than Coinbase/Gemini.  It’s good for trading but you don’t actually own your purchased bitcoin.  It’s basically a synthetic bitcoin that you cannot withdrawal onto your personal wallet. It just depends on what you want to do? Trade or Hodl....

Coinbase has a 3-4% exchange fee but the buy price is lower compared to abra which has no exchange fee. Approx. $40 price difference

I just joined this past Tuesday and immediately made a purchase with debt card and attempted to make a transfer to my personal wallet.  The transaction failed to send. I gave it two days and made sure the transaction was process with my bank.  I was finally able to send Bitcoins to my other wallet today.
