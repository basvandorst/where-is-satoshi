Excellent article.
Just one issue:


This is a common misconception about what happened that day. The fact is that the hacker **changed a variable** of an account to 500 000 **inside mtgox** server's **code** and proceeded to sell it, again, just inside mtgox exchange.
The price remained stable on others exchanges. The blockchain never saw these "coins".
500 000 seems like a lot of coins to be robbed. It didn't happen.
Other than that, great article and amazing infograph.
edit: Bold
edit2: Why the flashcrash?
The hacker was after Bitcoins. At the time, mtgox had a withdraw limit police of USD 1000 (either dollars or in bitcoins). At the current price (USD 17.00 per bitcoin), it was only possible to withdraw 58.82 bitcoins.
The price was too high to withdraw considerable number of bitcoins. A sell order of 500 000 bitcoins was created to plummet the price close to zero.
If the attempt to withdraw bitcoins from mtgox had been made right when the price was exactly USD 0.01, the hacker could withdraw close to 100 000 bitcoins. Luckily the price went up quite fast and the hacker only withdrew ~2640 bitcoins (at USD ~0.37).

Yes, there are a lot of coins lost forever already.  
But this is not a problem (for the system), because they are highly divisible. Theoretically an entire economy can run under only 1 bitcoin.  
You have to protect your wallet from 2 things: Theft and Lost.  
Theft: encrypt it.  
Lost: backup it.  
For extra protection, generate your addresses in a cold and clean offline OS (not connected), encrypt and backup it.

Good analogy. You have to explain that its a really big number of post office boxes, and you can really be anonymous with that.  
Mining is the way that Satoshi choose to release the values in the system, he choose both the timing (+- 20 years) and the proof-of-work system to ensure security of the rules.  
He could have chosen to release all the coins at once, but nobody would adopt it (for obvious reasons), or he could have chosen a bigger timeframe for the apex, like 50 or 100 years (I don't know if it would be adopted, either - too long).  
Personally, in this day and age, 20 years is a spotless time for a financial revolution. We urgently need this, but I don't think it can be done faster than that.

**Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS)**
The CAPS is a ballistic parachute recovery system designed specifically for Cirrus Design's line of general aviation aircraft including the SRV, SR20 and SR22. The design was adapted from the GARD system initially released for the Cessna 150.[5] As in other BRS systems a solid-fuel rocket, housed in the aft fuselage, is used to pull the parachute out from its housing and deploy the canopy full within seconds. The goal of employing this system is the survival of the crew and passengers and not necessarily the prevention of damage to the airframe.

I always think of that as the integrity of the blockchain, if a flaw is discovered in the creation of blocks ([as happened before]( people just decide the last point in time without errors and start again from that point, causing minor (and brief) disruptions along the way. So I think, as long humans respect the ownership history of the blockchain, it's a non-issue.


but any other currency that the world accepts as better would be a threat (i realized this when someone told me JPM is making one).
Good question. I really don't bother because if something better comes along, well, better for everybody of the world. Think about it, something better than bitcoin? It's good for everybody, less so for the bagholders, but I like to think on the former.
And, competition os good. Without all of those alt-cryptos, we'd never be sure which one is the best. We do now.


I use bitcoincharts.com/markets, clarkmoody, bitcoinwisdom, coinmarketcap, fiatleak. The main exchanges I use are mt.gox, btcchina, bitstamp and btc-e. Reddit and bitcointalk.org are good resources and you should find good discussion on both.

Nice comment by NeutralObserver:  
  
Very typical report from bankers. Without us "economies [won't] run smoothy": read without central control the govenment won't be able to intervene in economy as effectively (hah as if anyone belives they have effectively managed the economy thus far).
  
"Prices will invariably have to be adjusted downwards", in other words a great benefit to consumers and savers. We've all been conditioned to believe that falling prices is the death knell of the economy since people won't consume now and instead save.
  
First, why the assertion that consumption NOW is in fact always good for the economy? Perhaps saving a little and investing your wealth in new capital goods is better for the economy?
  
Second, since when have falling prices in, let's say, the computer industry over the last 20 years lead to "under consumption" or "harmed the economy". Cheap computers have been a boon to everyone and people don't seem to have any problem buying a computer now that they know will be obsolete almost immediately.
  
The assertions in the report are just that - faith that without the beneficence of our rulers we would all die a horrible death. Seems like things haven't changed since the days of the tribe...

Schiff keeps jumping from one argument to another (like everyone I talk to). One time it's the lack of intrinsic value, other time it's the volatility, then the alt-coins, oh but what about the early adopters?
Every argument has some explanation, but when Erik finishes one answer, Schiff comes up with another unrelated argument. And when Erik explain all the points, Schiff jumps at the first one again. It's insane, it's like he wasn't hearing the answers!! Well, he's acting like he's blind, or don't want to see or hear the true.

I really don't know what is less complicated:  
  
1 bitcoin can be divisible in one hundred million pieces = It has 8 decimal places = 2.1 quadrillion units =  21 trillions, plus "cents".
And if, in the future, it's not enough, we can increase the divisibility, instead of increase the supply. That great feature is unique to bitcoin.
