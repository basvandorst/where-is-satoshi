They'll all switch to ZCash soon enough.

At some point ABRA needs to stop hyping themselves up so much and actually fucking do something.  They are a very very distant third in their first launch market (the Philippines) despite more than 10x the funding of the top 2 combined.

Coins.ph and Rebit.

I like this, though one caveat should perhaps be that the item in number 1 should be detached from the scanner for number 2.  Most common biometric scanner is probably the fingerprint scanner in many flagship smartphones.

Who the fuck told you a Chinese internet company would make for a "non-volatile investment"?

Think that's a direct quote from Cody Wilson in the initial Dark Wallet promo (2:10 in the link below).  Also, the downward-pointing triangle (the opposite of the Illuminati triangle) is the Dark Wallet logo.

Dude, totally. Either from the future or from Skyrim.  Either way, fucking awesome.

Um, do central banks *currently* have enough gold reserves to meet deliveries?

I mean, you may be right, but unfortunately that's not how investing works...

The tech exists for it now.  You would just send temporary approval for the channel to access your location data along with your payment, an automated factory would process your order, then a drone would deliver it to you using your phone's real-time geolocation data.

Man, the part near the end of that video really makes the whole thing!

Don't use that as an excuse!  Lots of skills you can learn to get paid in Bitcoin (or paid in fiat and convert to btc)!

Sure bro, let's have a single person conduct ALL interviews on behalf of our decentralized network...

I'll try to snap a picture tomorrow, there's one on the way to work for me.  They really are everywhere!

That other digital currency that runs this place... Karma.

I'm taking a remote course he's co-teaching at the University of Nicosia and he gives lectures every week or so.  You can see them here:

How does it read for a layperson without any sort of background in legal theory?

What about Simon &amp; Garfunkel XT?

That seems appropriate.

Wait, I don't get this reference.  Is one of the prior Nobel winners on "possible Satoshis" list?

This is great, companies like this that serve *other businesses* are absolutely crucial to establishing value networks for Bitcoin.  Now, their consumer-facing customers who use Bitcoin have an avenue for re-spending it rather than just trading out immediately.  We need to see a lot more of this for Bitcoin to gain ubiquity.
Hey OpenSourceSteel, welcome to the community! One idea to take the promotion of Bitcoin a step further: **consider granting a discount to customers who pay with Bitcoin.** Great way to positively promote behavior change and possibly get your customers to start accepting Bitcoin in their own endeavors!

Just wondering (about to make a hardware wallet purchase), was there any particular reason you omitted TREZOR? or was it just a function of you not having experience with it?
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:37:33
It's a dumb joke about Bitcoin XT.

No comment on the news, but all I came here to say is fuck, Sunny Ray is so goddamn annoying on Twitter.  He does that shameless follow-unfollow scheme to "growth hack" his account and has done it to me at least 7 times (this isn't a random number, I specifically started counting after 3).  I have a negative association with the Unocoin brand because of how obnoxious that guy is; it's not really even that important but it just comes off as disingenuous.
@_date: 2016-07-21 05:41:17
Yeah, I actually can't find it on Amazon either.  Anyone have a link as to what it is?

In this moment, I am euphoric...

Is there a bitcoin circlejerk subreddit yet?

Can someone ELI5 this for me?  I'm new to the btc universe and do not fully understand what this project is/means.
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:02:44
Niiiice.
