This is one issue I see with bitcoin. Y'all jump on board and support a bitcoin accepting merchant then completely forget about them after a few weeks/justify not using bitcoin for purchases because you can make more hoarding than spending. 
If we want a large, self sustaining economy, we cannot hold merchants hostage by saying "I'll only pay you if you accept my magic internet money, *and* you should give me a discount because this money is worth so much!" 
Well if you have to convince the merchant to accept it by saying you'll be a loyal customer (at least to the end of the month), they will just write you off as some nutjob. Seriously. That's like me going to your place of work and saying "why don't you work for me in exchange for these rocks? But they're *special* rocks so you should work for me at 10% less than you usually do!"

[Bitcoin merchant here, commenting from throwaway]
This is the hard truth for a lot of bitcoin users. They always say "oh, I spend it!" but 90% of the time the discussion of bitcoin is on how much they made in the past five months, not how they're contributing to a global economic revolution. 
Bitcoin has so much untapped potential as a currency but people are blinded by the short term gains and are undermining the very market to which bitcoin's value is attributed.  
I suggest these bitcoiners go out and create a good/service and provide it to the bitcoin economy. Good writer? Become a bitcoin copywriter. Good salesman? Take your commission in bitcoin. *Contribute* to the bitcoin ecosystem and it will benefit you in kind. But buy and hold to ride "to the moon" and it will only lead to booms and busts, just like fiat.
tl;dr actually do something for and with bitcoin. don't buy and hold. *use* it just as a currency. because it is one.

I'm a merchant that accepts bitcoin. **I know how it works.**
