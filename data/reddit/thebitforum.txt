I would advise doing some research before you choose what (if any) Coins to invest in. I do believe though that litecoin is undervalued at the moment.

Nice! At least you have profited from bitcoin, it’s a nice story. Now you can star a career and start investing again into crypto :)

Interesting way of looking at it. As it is the traffic that is causing the higher fees, then that does make sense because the traffic is the result of more people believing in bitcoin.
Personally though I have started to use litecoin for all of my transactions. Bitcoin is like a long term savings account to save larger amounts, and litecoin is used for payments etc.

There is more than just that though, many technical variables at play. A higher fee doesn't mean that the bitcoin network is busier than the litecoin network, litecoin is built to be lite and transfers cheaper and quicker.

But I am sure they will make a encryption security that is produced using quantum computing, so that it can't be hacked.

Yes. Probably you are correct actually. Sorry about that, I will remove it.

Sucks to be a US citizen, taxed on your worldwide assets. No freedom really.
Luckily in Europe the laws are much more favourable for the citizens.

Where did you get a $10 fee from, is it a charge from your bank? I managed to do the process I wrote above in my article without any fee.
