They only mentioned that it had gone from being worthless to a value of $5,000. The plot then revolved typically for a sitcom when main characters undergo a sudden windfall: jubilation, deception, conflict, resolution. 
I mean, it's *Big Bang Theory*. Clearly the actual writing went into the spin-off afterward.

Congrats, and you don't know me at all, but now that you own your house I'd concentrate on saving up the money every year to pay your property taxes and whatnot. 
Also, if you own it free and clear, you're way ahead of everyone else. Having your own shelter is nice, isn't it?

No one enjoys it, and I'm going back to watching other crap until *The Orville* is on. 
Feel free to have your ex tell Chuck Lorre that.

It is better to be a pussy and not click the link, than to click the link and watch a grown man become a eunuch.

Ok. Can someone set up a GoFundMe for this guy and pay for it with bitcoin, because this is how U.S. citizens pay for medical care?

This is why you use the United States Postal Service for important, private letters. 
No, nothing stops anyone from opening a simple stamped envelope closed with scotch tape and maybe a stylish wax seal. It's the easiest thing in the world to open. But at the same time, nothing stops the USPS from wreaking havok and vengeance upon any unauthorized person who dares to break that trust, and every single law enforcement agency and court in the country knows it too. Benjamin Franklin knew what he was about. 
Not for nothing do the Republicans want to break it via financial means, instead of abolishing it outright.

Switch to a credit union or local bank. They'll often do neat things for free that B of A would charge out the ass for.
