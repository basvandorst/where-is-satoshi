Did they bill in GBP or EUR? My suspicion is that it will probably cost you more than 2% all in.. and probably more than the typical 4% on localbitcoins.

They won't be any more profitable than non-segwit transactions.. the price of all transactions will skyrocket due to the limited block space.. but LN transactions can afford to pay more than individual transactions due to them representing more value for lots of people each contributing some of the fee. I imagine on-chain transactions might cost around $20 in a couple of years.. that would be about 36BTC per block in current terms (20 * 86400 * 3 / 1000 / 144)

SEPA still works on their fidor account. Paycash was never a good way to fund kraken imo. Open an account with  and use that to get moeny into kraken instead.

It's under EUR.. the GBP market is a waste of time.. not much liquidity and no good deposit methods. Fidorbank allows you to deposit GBP by faster payments and convert it to EUR to be sent by SEPA for £2.49 - so you don't lose much value that way. You can also use it with other EUR exchanges such as bitstamp.net, zyado.com and many others. You can of course send it from your normal bank account too, but your bank will likely charge 2.5% to exchange it.

withdraw to your bank and then send it to an exchange.

You can check and see if your claim was approved on [this pdf]( If it isn't I suppose you can try contacting the bankruptcy administrator

Most people are not currently using bitcoin.. I'd say there are somewhere around 20k-100k people who actually make bitcoin transactions and maybe a few million that trade it on exchanges. In the future almost everyone will be using LN to transact normally (these will be cheap sub penny transaction fees).. with perhaps very occasional transactions on chain.
