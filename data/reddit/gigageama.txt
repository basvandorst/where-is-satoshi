At this point we have pretty much given up. We show her counter evidence, and she just trusts her "sources". Supposedly she hasn't sunk the thousands that some have. It's just the belligerent talk now that she is offended we don't trust her. She is a smart person, but unfortunately these are crooks that prey on peoples desires of money to solve problems.

Unfortunately my mother is one of these believers... Even received emails last night to be prepared for a number Wells Fargo would e-mail me. 
Here is a snippit. 
" RDS: the Federal Reserve is not Federal and it is not a reserve…..Its a criminal organization and it is bankrupt! We have an economic crisis and President Trump is doing all he can to bring back a gold-backed dollar and the 43 trillion stolen from the US taxpayers by the central banks. …. RDS: What I think will happen is President Trump will release $1 to $3 trillion dollars in a bottom up fashion.  
I have been speaking to people who have been in training with the US Treasury. This actually started before Trump became president by good people who were working on it without Obama knowing about it.   
What’s going to happen is a trillion or more dollars will come into our economy from the bottom up …this will be the greatest transfer of wealth in modern history.  
There will be 2 rules: Hire people with good jobs and good benefits and don’t rent anything…buy new… I think it will change the balance of power in the US.    
It will destroy the 2 party tyranny….I think we will see a new America the Beautiful when we get past all this ugliness we see now.""
