The landing page is empty for me, like all I'm seeing is a black screen with some buttons.

Agreed with this, have a page or so with some more techie information, even though some people won't care, there are people who do care.

A lot of shit they can do, you don't own the bitcoin, you're simply using the website. You definitely won't be the first person to open Coinbase, and see you being banned for some reason. Then good luck getting in contact with them and getting anything back (chances are less than 1%).
If you're getting some BTC just to do some trading, then Coinbase is easy to use. But if you're talking about 100's of thousands like OP, you REALLY want the BTC in your own pocket, thus a personal wallet of some sort.

Yeah, but as someone else on the thread stated, make a page with examples or so, have it something like:
"Do you want to sell on Craigslist but do not want to give out your number? Or do you just want to troll people with a number? etc etc.

Coinbase is great for buying 100$ worth of BTC and using that, it's an easy account setup and easy to receive etc. But when you're buying a ton of BTC, definitely DO NOT use Coinbase.

State this on your site, I would want a disposable number to pick up at bars, but when I came to your site I was like what am I going to do with this?
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:44:41
Have this more obvious, I've been looking for a few minutes trying to find out what numbers I can get.

Yep, like that! Not sure what you did with your landing page atm though, I'd change that XD
