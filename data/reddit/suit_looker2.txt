So I did some more reading.
Seems a MPK is a master public key.  I'm assuming this means I'd have a wallet somewhere and this MPK could generate random, receive-only, bitcoin addresses?  So I could get payments, but not send money out using them?
Then once it's time to pay out I could use my underlying wallet to send money to a winner?
Are there some existing APIs to help with this.  Maybe blockchain?  I haven't gotten that far yet.

Thanks!  I'll give that a shot today :)
I'm well versed in Python.  I've done PHP in the past (and do a lot of C++).  So it shouldn't be too difficult to do that translation if I need to.

Yeah, I noticed the Web wallet and I'm meh about it (it IS an online wallet after all).  CampBX has the wallet feature too in a way, since you can keep your bought coins on their exchange.
I noticed Coinbase is selling for a higher price at the moment.  Wasn't sure if that was the general trend, if coinbase had a larger user base than campbx, etc.

Good point.  I'd not want to run my own server with apache and python due to security issues.
Wasn't sure if there was an existing platform to leverage.  Maybe parse.com if it is usable for a website.

Ah, good to know about Coinbase.
Though I'll probably use them to buy some coins soon.  I haven't bought coins since Dwolla + CampBX was the way to go.

Did not know that!  $2 is a bit eh.  Dwolla was much cheaper.  I think Coinbase is too, but I'm unaware at the moment how much.

Thanks!  I actually bought coins with CampBX sometime last year.  Not much buzz around it though, where as Coinbase is talked about heavily.  So I was curious the differences :)

Ah, that would do it then.

Can't seem to edit my post
**Warning** user ADMINISTRATION is replying to users asking them to donate 1BTC to be featured on an article for CNN.  Stupid scammer...

Yep, exactly what I needed!
Though now I realize my asking price is a bit low (112, versus the selling of 114).  Wondering if I should cancel (does this count as taking 0.55% even if I cancel?) and re-ask at the lowest current selling price.

Thanks!  Solved.
