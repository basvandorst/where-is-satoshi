Welcome to the small block settlement network. With larger transaction blocks you could have given a lower transaction fee, let the transaction sit in the mempool for a few blocks until there was slack. Now you're in danger of your transaction not even being included.
This is the future that big blockers fear. Where Bitcoin is a settlement-only network instead of a settlement-too network.

Text of Post:
Hello everyone I'd like to announce the v0.1 release of btcaddrtocsv. A CLI tool that I use to convert public bitcoin addresses to csv files for import into a multitude of tools. I'd also like to announce that in addition to the basic python script that can pull one address I've also (in head) created a bash script to cycle through a number of BTC addresses. [Here]( is a link to the github page for the project and [here]( is the link for the 0.1 release.
Please remember that this tool depends on the blockchain.info api so if you're using it on a machine that can't reach the internet it will not work. I've been using this tool successfully for months now so I believe it to be stable. Please report bugs to the [issues page on github]( If you like what I'm doing here please consider donating using address [14UbKCCjxpU1jnzZHKGRf8xaP2a5RS4n9R](
Please remember, if you are using the new bash script to process several addresses at the same time, to create a directory called "csvs" for your csv files to be output to.
Let me know what you guys think.

@_date: 2017-02-15 20:49:38


But it does. Especially back when transactions were free and almost free. Essentially, because you can send a transaction with a message attached and *real people* are behind those transactions. You could send dust transactions to every address ever used and have them all hit actual people (who are technical in nature) for extremely cheap. The fear was that spammers would discover this and fill up block after block with these small, dusty transactions trying to reach potential customers with some sort of spam message. The belief was that if there was some limit on the amount of these extremely cheap dust transactions then the risk would be mitigated.

Cold storage? Multiple deposit boxes with paper wallets. Each with a subset of the total amount of bitcoin.

You can't be in violation of an agreement that was already voided by the other party.


And that's why a SegWit + 2MB compromise probably won't happen. I hope something like [bitcoinec]( takes off that gives us 2MB hardfork with a minimal implementation of Emergent consensus (doesn't implement AD, instead will "be loud" and warn operator if they're behind) + SegWit. We'll see if it takes off.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:08:43
Someone hadn't looked at the Segwit soft fork enough.

My guess is that the compromise **must** include a scaling solution that will scale for the near future. SegWit doesn't do that. BU/Classic/XT does.
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:14:56
Core never delivered the 2mb hardfork promised.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:54:34
That's not true. Currently Segwit is implemented in this manner.

@_date: 2017-03-17 14:50:41
The Hong Kong agreement explicitly calls for a 2MB hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:58:49


Miners agreed not to run XT while SegWit was being finished (and did so for nearly a year). In return it was expected that Core would build out the 2MB hardfork as promised as of Febuary 18th Core/Blockstream have been in violation of that promise. 
Had they released a 2MB proposal it's likely BU would have lost steam and people would have coalesced around Segwit.

Segwit also changes how blocks are stored, transmitted, and validated because it stores the witness data in a soft fork manner. Those things could be redone.

BU, with larger blocks, allows for higher adoption which leads to higher prices and a higher number of fees. Overall thats more monwy for the miners to take.
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:50:13
If each spv node downloaded blocks from the genesis block amd proceded to recreate the utxo set from the network in the background it could be partially trusting for a time and the migrate to zero trust.
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:13:35
If BU dies it's likely because an alt has started tp dominate the peer to peer digital currency usecase that core abandoned.

Yes they do, that's the biggest point.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:49:46
Yes and that they wouldn't run non-core which at the time was XT. Classic and Unlimited didn't exist at the time of the Hong Kong agreement. And all miners that signed the agreement did not run non-core client in the pools until after the 18th of Febuary.
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:06:55
HK promised a hard fork code release (but not activation) a few months after Segwit was released. In return the miners who signed the agreement would run core or "core compatible" software. The miners held up there end of the bargain, Core didn't even try to hold up it's.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:40:00
They ignored the Hong Kong agreement that would likely have passed.

Bitcoin will loose decentralization with SegWit/Lightning Network changes. It's already designed to move the network from a peer to peer network to a mesh one and by making it's too expensive for peers to actually use bitcoin, They're ensuring that governments have fewer people they need to shake down in order to control the network.

HK agreement explicitly says hard fork.




@_date: 2017-03-05 03:08:43

Not everyone agrees with your assertion anout the worth of Segwit. Hemce the reason "hard fork" was explicitly mentioned in the Hong Kong agreement.

Even with segwit we'd still need a blocksize increase.

This is a hardfork if it is has less than 51% hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:28:10
Read it again. It's 
1. SegWit release (done in 13.0; expected April 2016)
1. Hardfork Release (not done; expected July 2016)
1. SegWit Activation (expected Aug 2016)
1. Hardfork Activation (expected July 2017)
The expectation is that SegWit would release, be in a production client, start signalling and the hardfork code would land and start being ready to be signaled for.

Lighting is quite similar to banks. Yes it adds some additional protections against straight theft and seizure. But until routing is figured out nodes can and must still adhere to the networking requirements of the nation they're in. Which means (as an example) that Iranian &amp; US Lighting nodes will be banned from talking with one another. And if we've killed off p2p cash as a feasible backup method (which is what SegWit with no blocksize increase will do). Then we've effectively killed the dream of global, zero counterparty risk, financial transactions.

Core already agreeded to do this last year in the Hong Kong agreement and reneged on it. Why would people trust them when in the past they operated in bad faith?
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:39:52
Yes. He can always reply to his own tweet with the patch instructions. Thats how others have tweeted about vulns in the past.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:54:51
If you comment about a patch on github that's clearly an explotable vulnerability *and* patch instructions are available *then* while you don't have a legal obligation to include said patch instructions it is considered "best practice" to do so. It's why the "other sub" is salty; as it's a professional curtsey that most there would extend to Core if the roles were reversed.
It's also why I asked another thread about this issue to include the patch instructions.
They're mainly angry because they see nodes getting knocked off and assume it's the same core supports that have DDOSed them openly in the past. They shouldn't be *as* salty as they are but such is the nature of division. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:49:45
Because they got Core amd Blockstream to agree to 2MB+Segwit a year ago and Core just ignored it. If a blocksize increase was on the table it would already be implemented.

Diminishing returns. 6 confirms on LTC is insignificantly less secure than the same amount on BTC.

@_date: 2017-03-07 06:57:36

@_date: 2017-03-01 20:51:27
You're describing, essentially the current banking system and settlement network for things like ACH payments, credit/debit cards and the like. While this isn't a bad idea there's already a better settlement network for these types of transactions that's **already being used by the banking system** it's called [ripple]( 
Turning bitcoin into a shitty ripple while killing bitcoin as p2p cash isn't a smart move.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:07:25
Segwit is not a max blocksize increase. Instead it adds a new paradigm in tx storage.
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:10:38
Probably not anymore. Because core already promised this in the Hong Kong agreement and broke that promise, it's likely Blockstream will need to sweeten the pot somehow.

Not really, the idea is that if someone forks "too soon" their block and all all clients that followed sill seamlessly switch to the better (read more pow) chain including transactions. With "replay protection" you break that switch back amd make it more likely a fork leads to criss fork double spends.
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:22:15
Blockstream, the defacto leaders of Core, employers of most core devs did sign it. And they dodnt even try to push it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:40:55
Truth is most developmenent of new bitcoin projects is either moving behind curtains (industry R&amp;D), on to private "blockchains." Most of the open sourcey type projects that used to ve built with bitcoin are eother being converted to an altcoin or being built from the get-go with one, as most of them require a *reliable* peer 2 peer digital currency to work best. And bitcoin currently isn't that and if the current core team has it's way it will never be that.
I'm not saying nothing happened; but not a ton of stuff happened.

@_date: 2016-06-28 17:43:54
I'm almost certain that a Hard Fork used to be described as a scenario where pre Hard Fork clients would have to upgrade or change their client in order to interact with the blockchain either mining or as a client while soft fork changes would allow pre soft fork miners and clients to continue to work. 
That's why we can change things like RBF with a soft fork (because you can continue to use a non-RBF miner/client and continue to work). Or changes in transaction fees relay limits are softforks. Or back when we had a soft blocksize limit below the 1mb hardlimit.
If this is no longer the standard can we create a category called "actual soft fork" or "really soft fork" to denote which changes are truly harmless (like the soft fork term used to mean).
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:47:31

An 18% transaction fee? Better to use a Credit/Debit Card and pay and pay 2.5-3% fee instead. If bitcoin can't compete on price any more it loses it's potential to take over markets. Price was it's primary benefit over traditional systems.

The connotation between "soft" and "hard" fork has always been this idea that a "soft fork" is a change where old clients will continue to work without issue while a "hard fork" will require a client change. Even if that hasn't been the actual definition that was the connotation. If that's not the case we need to take these "soft" forks more slowly there are people today running custom code who will not be able to continue to run that code post soft fork. They need to be given more time to update.

A valid complaint. Most of the code for BTC1 is being worked on by Garzik. However there are other clients (Unlimited, Classic Xt) that can accept larger blocks to mitigate that risk.
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:41:02
I understand not wanting to do the work. But the truth is that pre 1900 people saced cash. The average person didn't invest in the stock market so recessions didn't have the same efdect on the overall economy.
That second half at least isn't true. Inflation has increased substantially Since 1912. [Use the Inflation Calculator]( to put it in perspectove (especially the graph at the bottom). Pre Fed there would be inflation or deflation but it was gemerally most related to changes in the gold market and various wars. Afterwards it's just forever inflation.
$100 in 1812 equals $72 in 1912, a ~30% increase in value. But $100 in 1912 equals $2293 in 2012  which is a ridiculous decrease in value. 
Price levels are definitely not more stable after the FED.

Yes. The initial hard fork from a 32MB limit to a 1MB blocksize limit additionally there was a bug in earlier clients that allowed unlimitd coin creation. Stopping that was a hard fork also. 
And after Satoshi we had the BIP-50 hardfork (bug) and (most importantly) we practised a blocksize increase with the 500kb soft limit upgrade. We use to have an effective limit of 500kb on bitcoin block sizes. We upgraded that limit using the same methods Satoshi suggested for doing a hard fork and it worked quite well.

Integralds, your chart doesn't show more stable. It shows more consistency but not stability. Over time prices are going up where as before prices were ping-ponging between a mean price, sometimes over sometimes under. 
Long term you could expect the price in the past to be somewhere around where it was today (assuming not war or gold rush caused massive inflation/deflation). I have no clue where prices will end up by the time I retire; which means I can't plan for it by "just saving" and have to take riskier moves to ensure my returns match inflation. 
Maybe theres some definition of economically or monetarily stable that says forever increasing price is stability. And if so I apologize. However, using a colloquial understanding of stable, the US dollar has not been stable.
Small nitpick; Your first chart is logarithmic in scale. This over-emphasizes changes at the bottom of the scale and "smooths out" newer changes. I know it's not a massive thing (as things like inflation associated with the War of 1812 is always going to look "bad"), but it is slightly misleading.

Antpool is still mining core blocks. And running core code. And has been for some time. Yes they yested some non-core code on testnet but they've also been testing segwit on testnet too.

Either they need to use a bank or payment processor who has an open session and whom they user also has an open session with (defeating the purpose of working around cash bans). Or they need to open a channel which requires a two transactions at least. One time use (a.k.a. the p2p cash use case) isn't Segwit/LN forte. SW/LN really shines in the high frequency transaction usecase (think stock market); it's an important use case but not one that is relevant for the marketplace usecase.

Precisely why Bitcoin isn't competing in the global payments space.

@_date: 2016-11-18 18:46:46
Your first example doesn't have p2p routing, it has BGP style routing. And it has fees on the route (that aren't going to miners). See it's [getroute]( doc. Lnd uses [channeldb]( which I haven't looked over but appear to do the same thing.
BGP style routing isn't bad. It's just that we have a better solution, bitcoin style p2p routing. In order to use lightning network efficiently you have to establish trust with your neighbours who you connect too. Too many "bad actors" and you start to get bad routes. There's enough issue with honest but incompetent actors to keep the networking team where I work continually bitching about BGP. It's inconceivable that a generic bitcoin user has the time to dedicate to such an endeavour. This means that either they'll send that chore to someone else (ending p2p bitcoin) or not use SegWit/LN (defeating the purpose of SegWt). 
Summary BGP is peer to peer but it doesn't solve the [Byzantine General Problem]( like bitcoin does. People want "layer 2" solutions not to regress and have the issues that Bitcoin has already fixed.
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:47:38

Miners loose money because the transactions that end up in the Segreated part of SegWit don't pay transaction fees to the miners. They pay transaction fees to the hub (if at all). Instead of getting 100,200 transaction in a +sized block they get 1 transaction in a tiny block.
If SegWit works as advertised miners will lose income.
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:18:34
Look I hold alts and bitcoin. If Bitcoin Core decides to keep bitcoin's block size too small it's good for my alts. If it allows it to rise it's good for my bitcoin. I win either way.

BGP is a trusted mesh &amp; spoke architecture. It's not p2p. It's certainly better than our existing financial solution but it doesn't hold a candle to the truly p2p bitcoin network.


Because the use case most championed is sending cash to a bank. Where you'd then use the bank's credit/debit network to send transactions around. So in a full example, miners would get a fee when people take bitcoin and put it in the banking system but none for actual transactions. They'd eventually get "muscled out" of actually earning transaction profits as eventually everybody trying to use the p2p part of bitcoin finds out that it's not only too expensive but that there's no space there in the first place.


You describe the current banking system. We're trying to build digital cash.


LN is the biggest benefit by far. And it's the one that makes people think that a blocksize increase is not needed.


That's debatable. It's getting harder and harder to use Bitcoin as a currency because when even a moderate number of people wish to use bitcoin simultaneously it's blocks fill up. We're at [80-90%]( average utilization right now. Peak usage fills blocks regularly. Of the last 6 blocks 3 of them ( [439569]( [439567]( [439566]( [439565]( ) are over 95% filled and there are 8 MB's of pending transaction waiting (and 20BTC of Fees). Meaning that 7/8 transactions are going to wait more than 10 minutes to get in.


I want LN too. Have for a long time. However I don't want to "give up" on on-chain transactions as Core wishes too. Look at India today. They're having a cash currency crisis. Thank God they don't know about Bitcoin because if they did just 1/2 of 1% of people waiting in line in those banks could paralyse bitcoin for months. Buy Core some time to work. Do a block size increase, allow on chain scaling.

How much time do you spend outside of this forum? There are a number of people against SegWit because it changes the economics of bitcoin, because it duplicates functionality found and focused on in other alt-coins and projects, because it's application LN still has a conceptual problem with routing, because it's quite massive, because you don't like that it's a "soft" fork when it quite clearly breaks older clients, because it doesn't solve "on-chain" transaction malleability, because it's being used as an excuse to maintain bitcoin's "temporary" anti-spam block size limit.

Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine Generals Solution]( Allowing for truly trustless communications. Lightning Network and other BGP style networks don't have that same reliability. A non-majority of bad actors in LN could in theory cause significant issues with LN as a result. 
In fairness this is not an issue if you have the choice of spending your bitcoin on-chain or over LN; however without a block size increase you will slowly loose that choice.

You have this backwards. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 23:22:19


Primarily by using Lightning Network (Or more accuratly wallets &amp; merchants who use Lightning Network that uses SegWit) or similar solutions.


If you use SegWit and you wait for the first transaction to confirm. The same malleability attack that took down Mt. Gox would certainly be possible after SegWit activates. SegWit doesn't solve malleability in the real world until merchants and user use a tool (like LN) to transact value. 
Lightning Network is certainly not required to take advantage of SegWit but it is the primary use case, the biggest advantage and the biggest thing waiting for SegWit before it goes live.  
@_date: 2016-11-20 02:45:49
Because they believe that a blocksize increase is the more prudent course of action and that if SegWit succeeds they'll never get one.
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:10:45
Lightning Network, the tool on top of SegWit that SegWit is suppose to allow, hasn't solved the routing issue so it uses hubs.

Big Blocks are currently scaling in BCHand Eth (which does approximately 2x the transactions Bitcoin does now). At their worst levels of optimization, they only need more compute and storage (which have gotten more accessible thanks to Moore's law) and optimizations in software like Xthin &amp; Graphene can further make blocks scale more. Right now a Raspberry Pi 3 could sync a 2MB chain, unfortunately that same pi will crash on 1MB because it will not have enough RAM to hold all the pending transactions in memory.
So ATM, big block systems enable more hardware than small block ones.

Three Reasons. 
1. I find it hilarious
2. I think it's a good break from the XT, BIP1?? Blocksize debate
3. I think it's important to realize that If bitcoin were mainstream that 75% of people in general would support it. And it's important to remember that fact when making precedents about how to hardfork bitcoin. I know people think we're moving too slow but similar to the actions of George Washington most of the things were doing are the first time were doing it. People in the future will look back upon us and use our actions as a model of how to do things. If we choose 75% == Change now it will be 75% forever.

Every society thinks that it's liked the problems of human nature. From the Ancient Egyptians through the Romans and into the societies of the today. They all think that the "barbaric" nature of humans from the past has been fixed and that they'll never need to return to force at an individual level again. 
And so they give up their rights to do so and entrust their security to an ever more powerful government until they find themselves once again in a failing state.

It does because miners live in meatspace. If 75% of the general pop supported this they would track down the miners in their jurisdiction and force them to change (via government).
In order not to implement something like this we would need to ensure that a full 25% of the network hash power are in countries that would refuse to coerce them.

It's hardly irrational. Look at the things government does and if you're not afraid of it you haven't looked hard enough. I live in a state (the US) that has complete domestic surveillance of just about every method of communication from letter to internet. If that sort of power doesn't scare you what possible could?


A. ) Randy is a heck of a shot.
B. ) Weapons are protection for an inevitable tyrant. They may not be effective but hopefully they'd make the task of trying to strong arm America so costly that a tyrant would never try.


In this case aren't we talking about an English state "more competently run" who is actively trying to abolish encryption? What about "more compentently" ran Austrailia's move to [jail whistleblowers]( Or Toronto, Canada's [crack smoking mayor]( (And let's be honest Canada is ran pretty damn well)? If this kind of stuff happens in the competent states imagine how much worse it could be in the US.


Maybe but given this is the government that [invented Concentration Camps]( has the highest [prision population in the world]( that [experimented on Minorities]( and still to this day [experiments on humans]( and still [tortures people]( And additionally claims the right to [kill any citizen]( without charge, or [abduct and toruture]( anybody (including you, me and all our countrymen) and torture them. Is it really a government that given more power would attempt to "accomplish great things socially?" Is that the characteristics of an organization that would be a positive force on a population?

Coblee owns the main repo so he definitely can. Additionally he's independently stated that Segwit main benefit isn't additional capacity, but the new transactions it would support. Amd let's be honest, bumping the blocksize when blocks are full is the only intelligent move.

2-8MB (Hong Kong agreement) isn't bloat. It's super tiny.
@_date: 2017-04-22 03:24:12
They already did, it was called the [Hong Kong]( agreement and it stated that:
1. Until Segwit was released, miners would not run Bitcoin Classic or XT.
1. Within 3 months of Segwit being released by Core, Core would merge in the code for a 2-8MB hardfork to activate after Segwit activated simultaneously developing this code in the open so that of development ran long it could be seem in good faith.
1. Miners would signal and activate Segwit.
1. Miners would signal and activate 2-8MB hardfork.
Segwit droped in 11.0 IIRC. ~90 days later Jihan, seeing no development towards a 2MB hardfork, started mining BU.
Presumably if Core came back to the table it might work, but I suspect that the goodwill neccessary convince miners to do Segwit then Hardfork was burned with that agreement.
@_date: 2017-04-23 05:43:07
He included the limit because of the potential for spam. He expectes to raise it, hence the soft limit raises in the past.
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:38:34
The introduction of Anti-Lock Breaks didn't cap the production of older breaks systems. 
Segwit introduces a new TX format that may end up being superior to the current one. But, it's introduction implements an effective cap on existing format transactions.
This is why Segwit + a 2mb *hardfork* had significant support. Shame Core abandoned it.
@_date: 2017-04-18 05:16:52

When verifying images most people will use OCR software to "read" the text on the documents and compare it to what's expected. This let's them prioritize which documents are likely fakes (mismatched names, wrong or misspelled text etc...). If the OCR software "reads" the watermark and finds text that it shouldn't; it will mark the document as "likely fake." Because of the mass of documents it's likely that Kraken, Coinbase and similar entities with low manpower queues will simply deny the potential customer because they just don't have the manpower to separate your request from the inevitable mass of spam.
I used to work for a finance company and document verification use to have a couple of floors of labourers pouring over documents. Their verification department was a dozen people and some fairly advanced OCR software.

Also there's crowding out, "Segwit with LN moves transaction fees 'off-chain' and into regulatable 3rd parties.

Dead bitcoin is bad for buisness."

On the contrary, it will be anyone can spend to Un-upgraded nodes and anyone can spend/Segwit to upgraded ones. That's the danger of a softfork.

Not hating.  I love bitcoin but it's regularly hitting it's hard limits right now. It couldn't  handle the added volume that a doubling of price would throw at it like it could last time. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 18:44:04


And that's why the price would crash. The original promise of Bitcoin was that it was a network for payments. The original arguments were whether Bitcoin would be suitable for micro-payments or if you would need to transfer "more normal" items. Look at some of the early ELI5's ([2013]( , [2011]( for bitcoin. It's clearly designed as a permission less payment system that you'd use "like cash." There's all sorts of literature about reaching "the unbanked", replacing credit cards, creating online marketplaces, replacing stock markets; all these possibilities that are technically possible with bitcoin's underlying technology but are at this point impossible.
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:03:04


I mean it doesn't only define it but it is part of the definition. 
Bitcoin works by being a cryptographically secured chain of digital signatures. In order to be cryptographically secure you do need a minimum amount of Miner interaction and because of the nature of Bitcoin's block difficulty re-targeting algorithm a sudden loss of 90% of Bitcoin's hash-rate would be devastating for it.  If Core was changing the block difficulty re-targeting that would fix some of the issues but it's not. It's essentially made a hard fork impossible for itself. 
TLDR: If Segwit2x has 90% miner support as it appears it does Bitcoin Core's chain is going to be dead in the water without an emergency hard fork.

Long term, Bitcoin with hobbled on chain capacity is a loser. And Miner's want to protect their investment. Additionally, the model Blockstream is pushing is one that is easier to control and censor by governments. Eventually, the will come after LN hubs and when they have the hubs and have forced everyone to use them they'll be able to cut the miners out wholesale.

@_date: 2017-10-25 03:04:58
It wouldn't. The new Bitcoin model is one that is non-functional for the unbanked and non-optimal for the banked. 
In the ideal scenario LN channels are a small but critical percentage of the types of transactions that people will conduct; acting as a complement to on chain transactios. Able to fill in and provide value in a number of usecases Bitcoin on chain is non-optimal for.

That's the point. With out the capacity we've essentially stunted adoption.


We are at capacity. And for nearly a 3 month period earlier this year we had a permanent backlog. Additionally, services have been sprinting away from using bitcoin as a currency to use crypto's that ready for this sort of load.


True most aren't, but a year ago [this]( was possible.


Bitcoin wasn't designed to be a play currency but a real fiscal option and replacement for fiat currencies. And with $2-3 fees per tx this low value use case become uncompetitive. Those fees add up and when you can pay $0.01 fees per (or less) with alts that are being accepted in more and more places this use case will eventually loose too. Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum, it's first mover advantage will only help it so much. 2000% higher fees than it's competitors in crypto and 400-600% higher fees than fiat (credit cards) makes it uncompetitive.


And with the LN-**only** model we never will reach that sort of adoption. LN is infeasible for people who don't have the slack capital to tie up. Especially when adoption isn't 100% of the world market; which in a voluntary currency like Bitcoin will never happen.


Effect has been a 50% drop in crypto market share, and a stunting of mainstream vendor adoption. Waiting for LN isn't a bad thing, waiting for LN at the expense of on-chain scaling is a bad thing. If you don't think that the full block from earlier this year hurt adoption; I've got some beachfront property in Montana that you might be interested in.
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:15:13


Is it that there just isn't enough altcoin support/adoptions that keeps you from using one? If so how long do you think the market will take to find you a cheaper option?
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:17:51


Given the amount of companies and the users they represent, [even according to core]( it appears as if the economic majority will be moving over to Segwit 2x so your point about miners mining the coin people use is even more salient.
What's more almost every major vendor uses a payment processor like Coinbase or Bitpay so it's pretty safe to assume that the economic majority will be supporting Segwit2x.

Merchants regularly outsource the management of payment systems to third parties, trusting their judgement. They're not going to overrule the judgement for adopting Segwit2x any more than they'd override their bank for choosing to use NACHA; especially if the effect of that choice is that they can get less complaints over a slightly used payment system and change absolutely nothing in how they do business. 
And the truth is that consumers that run their own node software are either smart enought to know the difference between Core and BTC1 and to send their coins to the proper systems for splitting; or their using a managed wallet like Coinbase, or Copay that are a part of the change.

Neutral Segwit I don't however, support Segwit at the expense of usability and on chain scaling. Hence the reason I've been a long time supporter of 2x and the Hong Kong agreement before that. Providing additional capacity while Segwit proves itself is clearly the best option. If Segwit+LN performs as Core's predicted we great! If not we didn't scede market share while waiting for it to prove it's failure.
TLDR: I've long said 2x +Segwit is the smartest move. I suggest you look further back in that history.

I mean, no Miner's block profile fits the predicted output of ASIC boost. So unless there's a new ASIC boost I doubt it. It's about as likely as a quick quantum miner.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:24:24
Covert Asicboost is most useful when producing empty or nearly empty blocks. A miner profitably using asicboost would need to produce small or zero tx blocks consistently to make it worth it. Otherwise the additional work to use asicboost wouldn't be worth it. [BitMex]( has a good overview of what it is and the expected behavior. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:07:14


Because the unbaked are often poor and they can't lock their money up in a payment channel on the assumption they'll use it later. And until we somehow convince everyone everywhere to use bitcoin and only bitcoin, they're going to need the flexibility to have the little money they do have available to use as they need.


People in poor countries, not the poor themselves. Bitcoin had a use case where it was protecting the poor in corrupt countries from having their cash seized by the corrupt governments in question. Fees will push that use case out and LN is infeasible for those who don't have slack capital to tie up.
By enforcing the LN only model; we're cutting out the lowest x% from using bitcoin at all. Anyone who lives "paycheck to paycheck" or lower will be too poor to utilize Bitcoin as their currency as they don't have enough stability to "afford" the fees associated with Bitcoin
Governments who wish to ban it will play the merchant class off against the lower classes (as we've seen so many times) and use that to "lean" on the LN hubs and get the system changed to something more favorable. Additionally LN allows for middlemen to "freeze" funds for periods of time. Governments can now make bitcoin unfeasible for the poorer parts of the merchant class to use and claim "success" for further censorship.
The current model is infeasible to be used by the un-banked because of it's capital requirements. Bitcoin then loses the potential to receive support from the masses, as to the masses it's a useless tool to them. That weakness makes it less censorship resistant as governments can play one group off another to censor transactions, interdict payments and altogether disrupt bitcoin usage inside of their jurisdications. The more a tool is used the harder it is for a government to ban that tool (see Prohibition) and Bitcoin with LN only is harder to use than Bitcoin with LN &amp; Big Blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-17 06:59:21
No, your answer is incredibly thourough and I thank you for taking the time to answer it. 
I'm trying to get a feel for common usecase to see how long Bitcoin has before LN needs to be ready. Based on what you said there's only an adoption/marketing question that keeps you from saving significant money with alts.

Them where is the option in core. If 0.15.x comes out with Segwit+2mb it activates in 90 days or less. What's stopping them?


Because we don't want tp be forced to use intermediaries to transact. Bitcoin is suppose to be p2p cash. With LN it becomes p2hub cash. Just look at current banks amd financial hubs. They rarely settle balances with actual cash. That pattern will be created with LN hubs too.


Without a blocksize bump fees will continue to rise to a point that people won't be able tp use bitcoin. But with a 1mb limit, there won't be enough money available to invest in additional hashpower and asic technology. Fees only have to rise to $10-20 to eliminate the feasibility of 90% of xonsumer transactions.

With UASF it won't be backwards compatible if it doesn't maintaing 51+% of the network. Remeber that SegWit transaction can be double spent by a network that doesn't understand or respect Segwit as 100% of today's. So after the fork date, without replay protection (as it is today) one SegWit transaction on the BIP148 chain can be double spent on the main chain making the UTXO set between the chains uncompatible. This makes it a hardfork. 
UASF done without 51% will cause a network split and hard fork the network between BIP148 enforcing nodes and those not enforcing BIP148.

10k in fees that they can't claim. Bigger blovks mean those tramsactions confirm, bitcoin stops being useless and miners remain an integral part in the process. 
Segwit without a blocksize bump still puts am artificial ceiling on miner income amd emsures that miners will sloly die out as more amd more transactions move to hub only as it's the only thing that cam be afforded.
Long term Segwit kills proof of work. It's not suprising that mjners are against it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:49:09
Segwit is a new block structure yes. But a blocksize increase no. It introduces a new concept called blockweight that has half of what used to go into a block. Under certain conditions it can process more transactions per second. But it's not a blocksize increase and not the hardfork explicitly agreed to in the Hong Kong agreement.

Hubs will become large enough to collude and artificially lower bitcoin fees.


Because settlement isn't really needed. The argument for LN scaling is that your tramsaction never needs to leave LN. 
Additionally if most can't afford to settle they won't settle. And without a blocksize bump even settlement will get too expensive.

Problem is that it wouldn't force Segwit. Segwit is a softfork and to un-upgraded nodes it's transactions appear as "anyone-can-spend" tramsactions. So a future network that activates 1+mb blocks but not segwit would still be able to claim your bounty.
You'd need to implement Segwit as a hardfork for that to work.

Any other president would ha e publkcly pushed for 2mb/Segwit so loudly in Adam's shoes that when he went to miner's and said he can we get Segwit as a sign of good faith they would have goven it to him.
Also a competent dev team, realizing that the product they needed to deliver in April of 2016 in order to be 3 months behind; was running an additional 10 months late would have coordinated a 2mb hardfork in the meantime to keep the coin going.

Bitcoin with 1MB is crippled, no getting around iit. In their mind, staying firm in their demand for &gt;1MB, while it may hurt bitcoin in the short term is the y sigt thing in the long run.

A soft fork built in the manner that SegWit is (one that invalidates transactions that would otherwise be considered valid), requires 50%+ miner support in order to not cause a hard fork. 
BIP148, if it included a 51% miner support check would be a softfork or, if it looked like upon activation, the softfork would have that support it would be a softfork. As it is, with ~0% miner support it's a hardfork.

If 1hash was selling miners with ASICBoost, one of the patent owners (my undertanding is that Jihan is one of a couple) could sue for a cut of the revenue. Notice how Qualcomm doesn't (and can't) sue someone like Facebook for using Arm in their own datacenters. However they can sue Apple for selling a product.

Well everyone should have their own private keys. Even if they don't have bitcoin controlled by those keys immediately, having keys where you can dump bitcoins to for when your off chain solutions fail is something that everybody using bitcoin should have. Similar to how every house should have a firebox and a little bit of cash for emergencies and important paperwork.

Original Comment you replied to. Holding them on an exchange does not give you exclusive control. I have bitcoins that I don't exclusively control and some that I do exclusively control. But you must realize that you take additional risk in that scenario.

Hard or soft is irrelevant apparently. CSV requires a change to clients and miners to regularly continue to work making it a "dangerous" fork. RBF does not require changes to clients and miners to regularly continue to work making it a "safe" fork (assuming my understanding of CSV and RBF are correct). 
While I don't support RBF I don't oppose it being implemented if only because of the knowledge that RBF can be ran right now and cause no issues.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:07:20
I think the economic majority generally wants either SegWit or BiggerBlocks but they're willing to accept the other if they get theirs too. It's the reason miner's agreed to the Hong Kong agreement last year, it's the reason almost every exchange and seller has come out in support of a similar concept (SegWit + a blocksize increase). If you head over to our sister sub you can find posts from before Segwit was even released stating that they'd accept such a compromise. 
Core stuck it's head in the sand for a year instead. It's not surprising that eventually people realize that Core is really that idiotic.

If your personal risk &gt; counter party risk and you wish to have the lowest risk then yes you should store in a centralized service.

What stops me from issuing a transaction using the same outputs via Segwit and the old system at the same time? Isn't that transaction malleablity all over again?
Additionally is it truely a softfork? If you don't speak SegWit you're going to believe transactions haven't been spent that have been.


SegWit's purpose is to make it possible to do something like the Lightning network with bitcoin. But the Ligthning network is essentially a Ripple-lite solution. The three big possibilites people keep talking about are, trustless exchanges, micropayments and organization settlement (think banks). Two of those (micropayments &amp; settlement) are already implemented and being used on the Ripple framework.
I'm hesistant to back a "softfork" that breaks existing clients and isn't backwards compatible if it's main benefit is that it provides for the ability to do something that's alreay being done in an alt coin. The model for bitcoin development has always been do your innovative stuff in an altcoin and if it's good enough we'll merge it back into bitcoin. There's a whole host of stuff that's being done in alts and I don't see why Lightningcoin couldn't do just fine.

I should have said engaging in economic activity is not a zero sum game.
If I buy product a (Even if product a is say $100) from you at 1 BTC (or in any other currency). You are not 1 BTC richer and I with 1 BTC poorer while you have lost $100 (in this example) and I gained $100. Our economic activity has also had a minuscule impact upon the market as a whole in a way that benefits all who partake in the market. 
In this case our  actions have provided a signal to all with products and cash that 1 BTC may be the going rate for $100 dollars. We have engaged in efficient determination of an equilibrium price, added confidence to the market as a whole and (assuming the exchange was voluntary) both received whatever personal satisfaction we choose to derive from our exchange.
This adds additional value even in a Forex type trading. This added value is the reason while mercantilism is not an efficient economic system.
In relation to the original idea that buying friedcat's USB miners by a rich man is making a poor man poorer (or at a minimum not improving his lot) is similarily not true. Friedcat has recieved BTC the miner has recieved his capital. Efficeint determination of the equillibrium price for a product has been determined. And most importantly to the poor person additional confidence in both products (BTC and USB ASIC Miners) has been added. The poor person's potential liability in investing in either has gone down. There is less price volatility in the USB ASIC miner &lt;-&gt; BTC market. Should the poor man ever choose to enter the market he now has the ability to engage in less risky of a behavior.
In relation to the addition idea that mining is hurting the poor man that is simply untrue. Mining is essential to BTC as a product and a currency. Without miners willing to invest hardware into the currency the risk of owning BTC rises as such problems like a 51% attack are possible. Mining decreases risk and increases the opportunity of the poor man to place his monetary assests into BTC and utilize them in a way he or she wishes.
Please correct me if I missed anything.
TL;DNR Voluntary economic activity benefits the entirety of a market by reducing risk.

Can colored coins not be based on satoshis/bitcoin but instead have their own blockchain (which is merge mined of course). This seems like it would allow a level of control by property owners.
In your example instead of Mt. Gox dollars being a satoshi instead Mt. Gox dollars would be their own blockchain that has been fully premined. When mt. gox whishes to give someone their money they would hand them their mt. gox dollars. This allows Mt. Gox to manufacture a coin specifically for this use. Ex. Mt. Gox dollars would be 1.00 coin = $1 (on the honor of mt. gox). But instead of being divisible to 8 decimal places would only be divisible to 2.
This use could move to all types of property. For example a deed to your house would only have 1 possible coin with no divisibility, A company might issue 10,000 shares of stock with no divisibility and then when they decide to split they can update their code so everyone with 1 share now has 2 shares etc....

Campbx allows you to tranfer up to $1,000 and trade with it before you hit AML requirements.

Who knows what satoshi will be worth in a hundred years or more? 
But I know that my deed to property will still be necessary. And it does allow for change quickly and efficiently. Change is always (in theory at least) better executed by an authority than it could be in anarchy. Change which could be necessary to do things like execute a merger between two companies. Or interact with fiat currencies when laws or border change.

Yes they will. Coinlab has been having some problems but if you're willing to wait a week for fiat transactions to go through then it's probably the most convienient way to buy bitcoin (assuming you have a checking account).

Authority has also given us good things like say google. The difference here is that one would have the decision as an individual to trust or not trust an authority. And if you're not trustworthy miners will not mine your e property and it will be worthless.

1) Blockchain transactions: Say just one major company moved to a colored coin system. Say it was Microsoft. Over the last 52 week MSFT has been traded 51,165,000 times per day or 592 times per second. Current estimates of the blockchain potential trasactions per second top out at 7 tps. And remember that just Microsoft trading the NASDAQ volume on Friday was 1,705,915,750. Keeping other e-property on other merged-mined blockchains allows for you to do things like increase the blockchain size without having to compromise bitcoin.
2) Transaction times: Right now the blockchain creates a new block every 10 minutes or so. Which is perfectly fine for currency. But other things may be better off keeping transaction times lower or higher. A stock may wish to put out a new block every 30 seconds whereas a land deed may only need a new block every month.
3) Accidental Spends: Imagine if you paid the neighbor boy who mowes your lawn with car title. Very possible with colored coins. Easy to make a mistake. This is why dollar bills are only used as dollar bills and not as property deeds. Better to use a dedicated system for property management.
4) Weird property: There's property out there that will not be best modeled by using satoshis. If you use colored coins to model their ownership you won't be able to take advantage of these different types of property. For example how do you put a lien on a satoshi? There common with cars and are still going to be used. If colored coins can't provide that allowance then something else will have to.
5) Extra Miner Revenue: By making all these systems merged mined we can increase the revenue miners will recieve in the future without having to pollute the blockchain. If our entire system of property moves over to distributed mined systems this would be a good thing in my mind.
6) Future: Bitcoin will eventually be obsolete as an e-property system. Take the world 100 years ago and think of all the things we've had to change to keep up with future developments. Now do the same but take 100 years from now into account. In order to stay relevant as just a currency bitcoin must allow different systems to rise and fall around it and no co-opt every financal system. Or it will be dragged down when those systems are.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:48:33
Imagine if every stock and every deed were a satoshi. We'd start to have problems. A merge-mined block chain is preferable in that it scalability is limited only by math.
Plus how does one "split" a satoshi? Will we have to keep track of which satoshi are worth one share after a split and which are worth two? What happens when a pre-split owner decides to sell a non-even amount of shares? Will companies offer their stocks in amounts greater than a satoshshi to allow for splits on future profits? How fast will that become a problem.
Yes it's cool that a old penny is now worth more than a penny but were not dealing with collectibles. Were dealing with property. And what happens when someone pays for something with a colored coin. Has the property legally transferred to the new owner of that coin? Is he responsible for property tax? He didn't intend to acquire anything but that coin. What if he didn't want the property? Imagine the problems if a dollar bill was dual purposed into a property deed and it was accidentally spent. Who owns the property?
The boy who mowed your (now his) lawn or you? By keeping the deed separate from the money we get rid of this problem in it's entirety. Nobody pays their bill in property deeds. Nobody accidentally looses a property deed. One keeps it's safe. That's why deeds work. And when you look at it the deed system is one of the earliest forms of p2p property, why shouldn't we update it for modern age?

"Value" is a function derived from (on market) Demand and Supply of a good. Of which both the Dollar and the Bitcoin are. As the dollar increases (on market) supply and decreases (on market) demand, dollars will go down in value. The poster above is suggesting that either (on market) Supply is decreasing (a.k.a. hording) or that (on market) Demand is increasing.
It's perfectly valid to believe that the "value" of bitcoin could be going up while simultaneously the "value" of USD is going down. You need to denominate it's "value" against something is simply a poor approximation of value (although it is the best method we do have available to us).

But the US gov't until last month did not regard BTC as an actual currency but instead as the equivalent of a multi-shop gift card. For example:
When I was growing up the local paper issued Brooking's Bucks that could be redeemed at a number of participating stores. Also they would change you bucks to dollars at the newspaper office or vice-versa if one so desired. The Brooking's Register was not considered a money transmitter by the US gov't.
There's no reason to believe that USD from Mt. Gox should have been treated any differently. Furthermore even if you consider that the exchange of currency was happening. It was happening in Japan. Easily outside of the laws of the US gov't. Their bank account wouldn't have changed money and currency in the US. It would have done so in Japan and simply be send to the US as dollars.

Buy some good paper and a laminating machine. Print and laminate yourself a paper wallet.
Be sure to get some security stickers too. 
Place small amounts on multipoint paper wallets. Then buy a really good safe.
