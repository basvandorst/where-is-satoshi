In a democratic society, "everything which is not forbidden is allowed". In a dictatorship, "Everything which is not forbidden is compulsory".
Drugs are forbidden, which is why got DPR his sentence; it would have been the same if  had used pokemon cards instead of bitcoins . Bitcoin in itself doesn't have any real laws applying to it so it should be legal by default.

By the way, was there any increase of tor/vpn usage from nodes recently ?
I opened my firewall port recently (around 1 week ago) so that my node be a full node, and today for the first time I noticed that I have more than 100 incoming connections and almost all of them come from only 10 different IPs which resolve to commercial VPNs or tor exit nodes. All of them are Bitcoin-XT 10.2, too, which I almost never saw before.

Also they create new problems, for example the rumour that MtGOX AML/KYC data has been stolen (and in other exchanges too). So instead of being "protected", customers now are at risk of identity theft.

There are "Blind Solvency Proof Schemes" that can be used to prove to anyone that their "coinPay" account actually holds the full reserve. The only thing needed is that coinPay actually provides the data needed for this proof, and that enough people expect this functionnality to force all the online wallets/banks/... to provide it as well.

There is easily 10% variation in bitcoin price per week, so the 3% discount doesn't means much compared to the random price you get anyway  after waiting a few days for your transfer to reach an exchange.

Using Tor this way implies there is a Tor exit node accessing the clear web and relaying it to you through the tor tunnel (as a proxy). If that exit node is rogue, it could fake/intercept/modify what you send and receive.

You almost always merge utxo at some point, when you need to combine several change addresses to make a big payment. It could take 1 week or 1 year, but I suppose that all your change addresses will end up being linked together by blockchain analysis.
@_date: 2015-05-09 09:19:43
That's probably already the case.
However, in addition to the best case scenario where miners and nodes simply have to validate well-behaving transactions (where your design works perfectly well), we have to protect against attacks.
It was the reason for the first block size limit: trolls were spamming dust transactions, valid but useless and exploding in size.
Here we also have to protect against attacks sending invalid transactions using all the possible space of the utxo. In that case, nodes would have to load everything from disk anyway, with awful performances. So to be sure that even this attack would not cripple the nodes, we take the conservative approach that everything should be in RAM.
But there are probably clever technological solutions needing less ram, with a better database or caching model.

Pruning only remove spent transactions, not "old" transactions. It still keeps all the unspent transactions, even the very old ones. 
A miner only has to validate that a transaction you want to spend, was not already spent and that you provide the correct script to unlock it.

Think of all the corner cases and implications:
* Can you define theft unambigously ? Are coins seized from SilkRoad by the government "stolen" ? would it be the same if it was coins of a pro-democratic organization seized by force by the North Korean government ? Who maintains the list ?
* How far do you track ? If a thief spends his coins to various people and marchants, and they themselves spend them, and you happen to be tipped with tainted coins that were stolen 1 year and 32 transactions ago, and you then want to cash-out your wallet, should the exchange block you even though you're innocent ?
* What if the thief immediately randomly tip a few satoshi, from 1% of his stash, to all know public addresses, like wikipedia donation, developper funds, etc.. will they all be permanently polluted and blocked ?

You got tipped 500 bits by n60storm4. What happens if those 500 bits were originating from stolen or drug money 1 year and 32 transactions ago ? Should changetip prevent you from withdrawing them ? If not, will you accept that when you withdraw them and transfert 1 btc to an exchange, those marked 500 bits make everything blocked and you lose 1btc ?

The way this one works, it directly generate a private/public key pair and sends you both. They can pretend that they delete the private key after, but obviously you should not trust it, and they could sweep your btc in this address in the future.
There is a secure way for a third-party to generate a vanity address for you without knowing its private key, called split-key vanitygen, but it's less userfriendly; see
