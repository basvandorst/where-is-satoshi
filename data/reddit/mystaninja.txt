Omg! I read that so many time in articles and i could never remember that amount for that small price that everyone was so skeptic to toss into an idea, yet anyone can waste $60 on ONE brand new top of the line video game.

I imagine those who work buying low and selling high would have a moderate fortune and then BOOM mega fortune!

It is fishy. Just paying people to do the work and you get a small profit share. Idk if any of those are legit

Well said, money isnt everything. In a side note, i tried to request $200 for my Xapo wallet a year ago, it was forever on pending so i just left it indefinitely. Its been 1year since that and i've gotten a new phone and and didnt get my google authenticator transfered. Im not able to login any of my walletsat all :(
