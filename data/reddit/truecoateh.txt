Thats kinda my point I guess. Bitcoin isn't a currency right now, when was the last time you bought something with a bitcoin? My guess is nobody has really bought/sold anything with them in weeks. Eventually it will drop to 0 because there is nothing backing it, there is no government behind it and there are no taxes you are required to pay with it. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:25:31
So the developers can arbitrarily increase the number of bitcoins in circulation? Congrats you've effectively destroyed your currency. There is no process where you can put that expansion in place without destroying the currency. This is not something you can vote on, market participants won't stand for it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:41:20
I guess you're not understanding my point either. Bitcoin isn't just software... It's currency. And I think that's where your problems are coming from. It's a lot more than simply rolling out new features and that will increase the market. Just because you make it easier to use does not mean it should increase in value.

All of which is meaningless because there is no way the value of a bitcoin can increase enough so that it will be suitable to be used as a currency in any meaningful volume. The functionality behind bitcoin might have improved dramatically, but since it didn't start off that way, and it's total market cap is so low it can't be viable. It needed to be restarted with a much higher market value, in order for it to gain traction. You can't have a situation where hoarders make billions of dollars from the price increase necessary to make this valuable for trade. You'd need someone like an Apple to start their own currency, put 100 billion in and say, we will guarantee an exchange rate of 1 bitcoin for 1 dollar to start the market off. You can't grow it from 0 to start, because you get the situation we're in now, where people are just speculating on price and not uses the currency to make purchases of goods and services.

The problem is with a fixed amount of bitcoins ever, there won't be enough currency to ever run more than a niche economy on it. The total market value of bitcoins is like 5 billion, you'd need to turn the money over several times a day, which is completely infeasible, in order to sustain any level of economic activity. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:11:02
You know that brings up a very good point. Overtime bitcoins will continually be "lost" as people forget passwords or die with no one to inherit them. Wouldn't this ultimately destroy the functionality of the system? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:57:05
Sorry let me amend, you want visa and MasterCard to lower their fees, you don't want the buyer or seller to hold bitcoins, so effectively you don't care about bitcoin. You just want lower fees. That better?

Thats the saddest part imo. They are rooting for the collapse of the current economy just so they can become rich not by actually doing anything productive, but by sitting on their ass and hoping their shit becomes worth millions. Hundreds of millions to suffer just so they are better off. Its kinda pathetic. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:28:19
So that doesn't really work over the long term. The implication here would be that anyone who is paid in USD would immediately convert that USD to bitcoins, and whenever they would need to make a purchase, they would pay for in in bitcoins which the merchant would immediately convert to USD by selling bitcoins to someone else. Everyones savings would be in bitcoins, but everyones purchases and income would be in USD. Just so that your savings would be in a deflationary environment and because transaction costs are lower? That seems like a case of a free lunch.

What in the history of BTC makes you believe its a store of value?
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:41:13
Um, if bitcoins become popular enough so they have a dramatic rise in value they are directly taking away from those who don't own bitcoins. This is because bitcoins are simply a currency, they don't increase the production of real goods and services, its like if the government printed a trillion $ and gave it to a couple thousand people, those people are better off and everyone else has to deal with devalued dollars. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:48:32
Which is why bitcoins will eventually be worth nothing. With only 24 million units, the currency base is just too small to act as a primary medium of exchange, except at much higher prices.

And deflationary has the exact opposite effect, it discourages investment! Why would I take out a loan to build a plant or a building that won't pay off for a few years? I'll end up losing because I'm spending money to invest today and in a few years my investment will most likely be worth less. Deflation not only encourages less spending, but also less investment in the future and would kill off tons of long-term projects. It is pretty much terrible for the economy to be in continuous deflation.

You're asking why something that has gone up 1000% in a couple of months suddenly drops? Really? The price in bitcoins is completely disconnected with any underlying economic activity, there is no rational explanation for any of its movements. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:06:27
Let me ask you this. Why would the value go up 10-100x from here, so that it would be valuable enough to conduct meaningful volumes of trade in? Is being able to pay for stuff with bitcoins really worth that much more than the current system of paying with dollars?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:53:40

@_date: 2013-04-12 01:43:10
His fatal flaw is when he talks about saving and trying to compare saving as simply the choice to purchase capital goods (ie investing) instead of consumption goods. This requires someone else to become indebted as the method he derives as you purchasing capital goods, is actually depositing money into a bank which in turn lends that money to someone. This is not nearly the same thing as purchasing a capital good yourself. And since the expectation is that investments return profit, or otherwise are not made, readily leads to an expansion of credit which ultimately leads to a collapse as those that borrow can no longer repay the original savers investment + a return. If the quantity of money is fixed, an investment that returns a profit necessarily decreases the money available to others in the economy. Which leads to the economy grinding to a halt as investors either make money and choke out everyone else in the economy, or investors lose money and stop investing. Its a nice theory he has, but the fact of the mater is, no economy has EVER functioned with a fixed money supply. The closest thing we've had in the US was during the 1800s, where there was a recession or depression on average less than every 2 years. At best a economy with a fixed currency would experience these type of frequent swings in expansion/contraction. Its all about people being unable to save in aggregate in a fixed money economy.

Look into the shipping industry circa 2008, and that is the future for all the people getting into bitcoin mining now. Huge capex spend on ships that ultimately lost 90% of their value. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:51:09
That is just changing the decimal place, it is not increasing the currency in circulation, and it has no impact on money flow which is what the economy thrives on. In a fixed supply currency all profit = 0 in that currency, as the supply never increases, it is just a transfer from one party to another. And by identity all this must balance. Since in aggregate people like to INCREASE their savings, not just maintain them, this becomes a real problem. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:06:17
Thats a very interesting way of thinking about it. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:43:50
Bitcoin is effectively locked, there are developments to increase the value if bitcoin, but those could effectively be applied to other digital currencies as well. You cant make bitcoin V2.0 without it being an entirely new currency. The problem with bitcoin is in its origins, there's simply no way for it to become a viable currency based on how it started. Bitcoin could work if it was restarted with a sufficient market value of currency, it's just not possible to have a currency grow from near zero to billions or trillions of dollars. It has to start off being that valuable already otherwise you have these huge volatility swings and huge gains by early adopters. Basically it would need to start off as being sponsored by some large entity and eventually weened off of it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:41:20
So basically you want companies like MasterCard and visa to provide their services for free? You do realize the only reason there are no charges for bitcoins right now is because all the people operating the infrastructure aren't charging you anything right? What happens when it becomes more widely accepted and more volume necessitates higher people to handle it? Dur, someone will start charging you for transactions. Heck I'd love it if visa didn't charge fees for their service... But then why would they provide that service?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:30:41
See the whole getting more vendors to use it doesn't really work. The market value of all bitcoins are too low to be actually useful on a meaningful scale. It's not worth the effort for most merchants if there is no serious volume. If every merchant started accepting bitcoins for payment, they would get on average less than 1 customer a week paying with it at current values. Bitcoin could work if you restarted the whole economy with it (ie take everyone's USD and replace it with a proportional amount of bitcoins), but the way it was started there is no way to get there from here. It can never grow to be a functional currency because it is simply too small and all future bitcoin value would have to come from price appreciation which isn't feasible.
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:46:25
Right, but then you would be using something else as your store of value. When you decide to run a business, you usually do so because you think you can turn a profit. And you measure that profit in whatever currency you use. With a fixed supply of currency by definition profit as measured in that currency must equal 0 when you aggregate the entire economy. Therefore you must measure any system-wide (real) profit in something other than the currency in which you transact. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:52:13
Down vote me more! Bitcoin might be a great idea in principle, but it's implementation leaves it fatally flawed and there is no way to fix it without scraping the entire thing and starting over. You are basically putting your faith that one random dude designed a perfect currency on his first try without testing it first. Does that sound likely to you? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:09:35
Right, the whole this time it's different argument. Gotcha. Also, bitcoins are only worth 800 million at the moment, how can it be used to serve a 1 trillion dollar market? It can't, which means it can't have widespread use. Unless its value goes up significantly, which as you'll come to find out isn't possible. So back to one of my earlier points, you can't get THERE from HERE, you need a higher starting point in order for this to be viable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:08:55
The only way to make bitcoin a viable currency is to start over, have someone back it at a fixed exchange rate in unlimited quantity and have the market value of bit coins start at something like 50 billion USD. At its current market cap it is useless in terms of wide spread trade, and if the only way it can increase its market cap is by increasing its price... That's not going to work.
EDIT: sounds to me like you don't even want bitcoins per se, you just want the type of payment method bitcoin provides, you could care less about the currency part.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:56:35
So to get away from the terrible problems in our financial sector you... go to a completely unregulated currency that has 50% daily swings in volatility? Makes sense.

Slowing in economic growth, deflation looming still for the dollar.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:28:52

@_date: 2013-04-23 00:53:36
Yes, but eventually it will be fixed, very much unlike gold which has increased throughout history. We should be discussing the end game here since if the end game doesn't work there is no point discussing the middle part.

This is what boggles my mind. If its still in the price discovery phrase, why are you investing? Bitcoin has been around for years, its went up huge recently because its had tons of publicity and everyone is buying in. You are not buying it because of its supposed benefits, you don't believe in the future of bitcoins, you are buying in because you think the price will rise in the near future. That is all. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:35:17
Except there will never be enough bitcoins in circulation to run any semblance of an economy. Gift cards are about 2 orders of magnitude larger than the market value of bitcoins right now, and even those only account for a tiny fraction of economic activity.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:26:36
So you'd rather be in the Stone Age and not advance technologically? Inflation is good, it allows people to save without needing someone else to dis-save. How do you think the economy functions when there is a fixed amount of currency? If the money supply is not increasing, all your income must come from someone else's spending, and it must be in balance, meaning you can never save without someone else reducing their savings. That is a horribly fragile economy you've created.

The problem with bitcoin is that it's not scalable, the market value of bitcoins is too low for it to function as a medium of exchange on anything but a tiny scale. Since there is a fixed amount in circulation it can only become useful if the price skyrockets enough so you can actually trade with it.... But the price can't sky rocket enough because there's too much incentive to cash out and not enough incentive to buy at really high prices.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:00:39

How is FIAT broken? The real problem is, ANYTHING we use for money has problems with it. Its because you are trading REAL goods and services (which is the real economy) for something that is governed by a completely different set of rules. The main issue with any economic system is that people desire to save, which means you need a constantly increasing supply of "money" to satisfy that savings desire. You can't do that with hard currencies like gold. So what happens in those economies is you have large periods of inflation followed by large periods of deflation which cause huge declines in real economic output, as people change their savings rate which by definition changes others incomes. By using FIAT, you effectively moderate those fluctuations by continuously pumping money into the system so people can satisfy their desire to save while still purchasing real output from other players in the economy. FIAT isn't perfect, no solution really is, but it is a much better alternative to hard currencies. Again, look at the history of the 1800s while on gold standard. There was a recession/depression on average LESS than every 2 years!!! Thats insane!

During the 19th century there was a recession/depression on average every 2 years. This is what one would except under a semi-fixed currency, recession/depressions caused by wide spread bankruptcies are the only way to resolve trade imbalances under a fixed currency regime. I don't know if I would classify that as doing well, sure there was tremendous economic growth but it was at all times highly unstable.

The Ultimate solution is to devise a system that does not use money. The only problem is you have to overcome a number of issues to get there. 
1.) Allocation of resources, how do we determine who gets what?
2.) Incentive to produce, how do we get people to make the real goods and services we need? And how is the value of this production determined?
3.) Relating to 1 and 2, how do we distribute our production to the population? (this might be the easiest to solve, simply have centralized distribution centers where people drop off their production and pick up what they want?
4.) Freedom, how do we let people have the freedom to do what they want/live where they want under these conditions and still meet production needs?
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:17:01

@_date: 2013-04-23 00:39:40
I think you are missing the major point here. How do you obtain savings? By providing labor, or by running a business that makes profit. Its not about spending or not spending bitcoins you already have, its about how do you obtain more? And how do others obtain more? Its about EVERYONES desire to obtain more savings. Which is impossible under a fixed currency, because your spending is someone elses income. Everyone (in aggregate) desires to spend less than they earn, but thats not possible when all transactions must balance. It has less to do with how much your money is worth, and more about how any economy can function and PROFIT in that currency when profit in the entire system must equal 0.

So they only get done if enough people commit to the project, many of which have little to no knowledge of what the endeavor specifically entails? There is a reason we have banks, its so that we have specialized people to make these decisions. It is hugely inefficient and almost assuredly lead to worse outcomes if we have to fund many/all projects by crowd-sourcing. There have been tons of good ideas/projects that would not get done if we needed a popular vote every time someone had an idea that they didnt have enough capital to start themselves.

With only 24 million total units, bitcoins will eventually be worth 0. There aren't enough in circulation to drive an economy, unless you think it will go up over 100x in value from here.  All bitcoin is is a fad, there's no unique value that it brings. The best case scenario is that it ends up as a niche currency that a very very small segment of the population uses, and only uses because they think its cool and there is the infrastructure in place to easily convert it to more useable currency. If we tried adopting bitcoins as the dominate or sole currency we'd see what a bad idea it really is, its a novelty fad that is small enough that you can have these massive price swings.

At 200$ a bitcoin the total market value is less than 5 billion$. Its not how much you can divide them up. You can't run an economy with only 5 billion in currency circulating. And no, the price won't increase to $200,000 a coin to make up the difference. The only reason the price has increased such a large % so far is because the market is relatively small. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:09:02
It can't. You can't grow the bitcoin economy organically. You'd basically have to have an entire country adopt it all at once in order for it to have a chance as a functioning currency. The market value of bitcoins is far too small to have any value as a primary medium of exchange. Basically it's like the old adage, you can't get there from here.

The anti-money laundering reasons are strong. If you can't determine where transactions originate from any illegal enterprises basically have free reign.
