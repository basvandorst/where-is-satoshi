Hi all. This has been fixed.  - Asher @ CoinJar

Asher from CoinJar here. Did you contact support? DM me your ticket number.

We know our business account was getting some grief because of a few fraudulent deposits by users.
However on the personal side, there was no communication about why this happened. We found out by accident after one of our cards got declined... then everyones card was declined. And at this point we aren't able to close our account to get my measly amount of cash out.
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:28:08
Some cool ideas: 
@_date: 2013-09-03 05:26:52
Agreed. People who don't feel comfortable with ZhouTong's history or the security we provide are encouraged to move their coins offsite as soon as an exchange happens. Our managed wallet is for convenience and not a bank vault. -Asher @ CoinJar

Ryan is a great and honest co-founder. But as a 17-year old sometimes you can trust the wrong people.
@_date: 2013-05-18 13:38:24
I need to get my co-founder to trademark his name :P
disclaimer: I work with with the real zhou tong. I also think your videos are pretty funny - will you make a new song for us?
@_date: 2013-05-16 04:36:07
Thanks! First time I've received a bitcointip :)
@_date: 2013-06-26 04:58:53
 I'm finalising next month's Meetup soon.   
@_date: 2013-05-01 01:35:52
Done! Thanks

The simple answer is that he's enrolled in University here in Melbourne.
I've known him personally for about a year and been working with him over the last 3 months. We've travelled to Singapore together as a team as well. 
As a co-founder we own equal portions of CoinJar (together with investors and our other co-founder), if anyone should be concerned -- it should be me! And I was happy enough to get talent like him in. The only way he will be able to earn back the bitcoin community's trust is to make something better than Bitcoinica.... and that's why we're working so hard on CoinJar.
@_date: 2013-07-08 07:35:15
We're sorting out some issues. Automating some stuff to ensure we can handle more load. Hope you guys keep using our service cause we're making it better.
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:55:02
We're a Bitcoin startup testing some of our assumptions about the market.
@_date: 2013-05-30 07:35:57
We're working on it. Getting through banking and financial regulation is tough! 
@_date: 2013-08-16 13:18:46
There are only 4 big banks in Australia. They're the only one not using 2fa. It just makes them an easier target compared to the status quo.
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:56:22
Totally understand where you're coming from. It's early days and we've just incorporated. Selling Raspberry Pi's isn't our core business -- hopefully if feedback is good we'll do a proper launch.
@_date: 2013-05-30 10:59:16
This is our first one so we'll plan the second based on response. But if you're ever in Melbourne am happy to meet up for coffee. PM me for more info.
@_date: 2013-07-05 07:30:28
I quit my job to start CoinJar. If you want CoinJar related media:
 - Episode 20 with Me and Zhoutong
@_date: 2013-07-10 11:12:36
Awesome list. I'll go over it and see how many are relevant. Thanks for that!
@_date: 2013-05-23 01:27:44
12-months. He's 18 now, I was speaking retrospectively.
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:58:08
Nope. But Eric if you're reading this -- we're really keen to work with you. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 08:40:50
We just deployed our wallet. You can use it to store your BTC. We haven't started selling BTC yet. We're setting this up ASAP. 
Also big ups to  - Aussie retail accepting BTC storewide.
@_date: 2013-08-15 22:41:01
It's only been 3 days so I've still got ramen, some cash, and a small amount of bitcoin which the community has already offered to buy off me if I need some fiat.
Thanks for the support! Will keep everyone updated.
@_date: 2013-07-05 07:17:06
Also happy to meet anyone at the Bitcoin Melbourne MeetUp: 
@_date: 2013-05-01 01:27:31
Thanks for pointing that out. We'll edit the site to make it really clear. We'll ship to almost all locations for free.
@_date: 2013-07-19 00:53:54
Also  free, no ads. 
However we only accept merchants (no gambling / exchanges)

Level 1, 41 Stewart Street
Richmond, VIC 3121
@_date: 2013-07-19 14:41:23
Most definitely. It's a needed feature.
@_date: 2013-07-10 08:44:47
Thanks. This isn't just an Australian project though -- it's for everyone!
@_date: 2013-08-16 13:11:33
Thanks mate - Asher from CoinJar here. We try our best to be open. If you wish hard enough it may come true, we like Europe quite a bit!
@_date: 2013-05-16 06:41:46
Also if Redditors have any feedback or suggestions, post them up. We're trying to be as community focussed and open as possible.
@_date: 2013-06-17 07:38:52
Not cameras per se but if you're looking for high-end camera rigs,  - email the guys who runs it, he accepts Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:20:39
We're processing orders now. Hopefully some positive confirmations will flow through to the Reddit once they arrive.
@_date: 2013-07-05 05:36:55
Hi guys, Asher from CoinJar here. 
Thanks for being so supportive. If you're waiting on your confirmations / bitcoin to transfer, trust nothing untoward has happened -- just been working to get this feature up. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 08:49:09
We're happy to have Ryan on our team and we'll be always open about our company. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 11:08:33
We just switched to NAB:  
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:57:07
Sure, no obligations. Hopefully the first few orders will arrive in a couple of days.
@_date: 2013-05-01 07:35:58
Nothing wrong with being *that guy*. Since there are lots of questions, I'll start with a slow reveal.
We're an Australian based startup backed by early stage incubator  (you can PM me for references). We're looking at creating something in Bitcoin space and are testing the market with products that early adopters are looking to purchase.
Hope that clears some of the mystery. We have a lot more in store, but not quite ready to reveal all our plans yet :)
@_date: 2013-05-30 07:18:28
I run a Melbourne Bitcoin meetup:  : next meeting June 12th.
I also run a local Bitcoin based startup  (venture accelerator backed). Keen to meet up with others in the community.

Yes, same one.
@_date: 2013-08-15 22:42:36
We've nearly paid all our creditors from last week. However we have a good pile of money sitting in our company account which we haven't touched for a week. I am sure we will have access to it soon. The community and media have been great support. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 01:16:39
I've had at least one other person confirm Bitstamp is CBA blacklisted. If a third person can verify I would say it's certain.
@_date: 2013-06-14 04:46:21
I have ordered to Australia. Satisfied with service.
