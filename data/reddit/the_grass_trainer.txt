This is what I don't understand, and no one is helping me out but instead just downvoting and being rude.
NN: save the web "help stop tolls and extra fees and shit from happening to the web!"
BTC: will NN have an effect on BTC?? "wtf you talking about skrub?" 
I just wanna know if it's a better idea to wait for a drop in price to invest. Will NN have a big impact on this kind of currency? How is this so difficult to answer?

So we all know about paywalls, and extra fees will be enforced if it doesn't go our way.
How wouldn't this affect BTC? If you don't actually know then please say so, and I'll wait for someone that does.

Right right, but if BTC becomes even bigger, and a dip is expected/does happen, then it would be a good idea to invest a tad bit, yeah?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:36:45
ಠ_ಠ no one can predict the future. That is a given. I'm just asking a question, and dunno why everyone's getting upset. Just asking for information. Jesus it's like pulling teeth.
This a good idea? "What?"
Is it a good idea??? *Downvoted* "WHAT????"

Would it not be a smart idea to wait for this NN thing to happen this month before buying into Bitcoin? 
I would love to buy maybe $50 worth every once in awhile to start. But i feel like right now wouldn't be the best. Am i wrong?

Good idea to invest if it goes down? Yes/no/maybe so?
Will NN affect BTC?? yes/no/do you even know?

My goal really would be to just throw in a little money here and there as a side investment.
I know what is a little bit, and watched a video that another user linked to. And I'm not looking to get rich quick, but I feel this would be a decent intro to investing.

From what I've found out about bitcoin:
* Uses no traceable bank info
* The person that "stole" would probably need to know your Secret Key, or only knows the Public Key.
* Public Keys are given out and the "merchant" makes a [pull request] for the amount charged. The video i watched claims that you give them your wallet address and the other person pulls out an amount, and hopefully the right one.

Wouldn't BTC take a hit, too?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:03:45
Once the price drops would it be a good idea to buy in, and wait around again?
Edit: still don't know why I'm being downvoted for asking questions. Hate to see how you treat old people asking for help with phones ಠ_ಠ 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:51:17
Yeah I've been keeping tabs on BTC for awhile now, but if NN doesn't go the way we want it I'll end up unplugging from the Net. So buying now seems like a bad idea for me.
But also, wouldn't the tolls and extra fees from Ajit Pai's boyfriends take a huge toll on BTC transactions? I don't want to start an NN debate here, but does that come into play at all?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:34:36
Because it uses the internet to function. Yeah it's p2p, but doesn't that require internet access?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:14:33
I just view it as I would view any other stock, really. This is something i am researching before spending money on, so don't get me wrong. I plan to start slow, and invest a small % of income into this on the side.
Just no one seems to know if NN will have an impact on btc if at all. I can understand it's a gamble ($-wise), but what about its application if NN goes south?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:06:03
Alright well I'm new, and i asked this yesterday but got no help. Maybe asking in this thread would be better.I want to get into Bitcoin, but start out small. 
All I wanna know is if it's a good idea to wait for a bigger price drop to buy in, or take chances now? In addition, if i try to get started now, how will BTC be affected by this NN thing if at all?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:34:48
Because... You have to use, and bear with me on this one... The internet for bitcoin. How would it NOT be affected? 
That's where the confusion should be.

Why not buy out the president instead?

Sorry, i had Lil Jon in my head as i was typing that :/ 
But hey! I also just learned a thing, so thanks! :D

Overseas will you have access to your Google Account? Is the device you're going to use registered with the US number Google currently has? If you have the same device on-hand you'll be fine. If you're gonna have a different device you should set it up before you leave, and turn off the other one.
Google will send the authentication code to whichever device you are using currently, and have proved that is yourself (aka clicking "yes it's me" in the email they send you).
Edit: the answer is "no it won't be affected." You're good.
