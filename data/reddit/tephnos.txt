Selling on Bittrex to get 1200 dollars per coin, for one.

Yes, so you missed out by not having them on Bittrex in the first place. If you kept them on an exchange that claimed they would support them, you knew this was a possibility. Alas, you did not.

And then if the market turns on you suddenly your bots won't be able to save you and you're carrying some heavy bags unless you have also implemented tight stop losses and the bots know to stop trading on the downtrend (speaking crypto wise, wall street bots are a whole other level).
Making a living off of day trading is like trying to become a superstar. Very very few people will ever actually make it.

Sounds like positional trading, which is where the big money is anyway.

The problem is you are relying on your TA in a heavily manipulated, extremely volatile market.
It's working because as you say, we're bullish as fuck. TA in forex doesn't work nearly as well for crypto for the short to intermediate term.

I'm pretty sure the statistics have said time and time again that the holders (assuming growth) always win compared to daytraders. Obviously, the payout period is much longer which is why it is not attractive to day traders. Trading over a few days while looking at monthly charts is positional trading, not daytrading.

Man don't keep your entire balance in an exchange that could go down whenever and you'd be fucked.
