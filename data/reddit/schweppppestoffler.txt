Who's running that tab though? Is the entire process absolutely trustless? I want to know that this isn't a mini centralization direction. PLEASE!

I too would love to have a boat and bitcoin at the same time. What kind of a boat do you have? 
I'm aiming for a powerboat, sub 30 footer. We won't be moving too much so we prefer the convenience of beamy-ness as opposed to nice sleek sailboats. 
We also don't want to buy any land because fuck that, that's a permanent anchor...

Largely removing the government from meddling and all those bureaucracies is a historically unprecedented affair. This is only one small point from the many.
I think we should be prepared to see weird. Either that or lose money.

90's tech sector is a COMPLETELY different ballgame than today's crypto space. It's another paradigm itself. Some economic fundamentals will remain but most books will have to be revised.

Sell your bitcoin then. Quickly, before most people realise this. 
Otherwise you're talking nonsense.

coins =/ tokens =/ 90's tech sector. But you play with your own money and I'll play with my own.
