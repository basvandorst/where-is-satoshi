Right and the PATRIOT Act is patriotic. /s
Most "Fire Safes" are rated something like "UL 350 one hour". That means the safe can withstand extreme temperatures for 1 hour. A house fire is usually much longer than that.
Now, they do make ridiculously expensive safes that are rated UL 125 3 hours. Those are much better for protecting paper for a long period of time in a fire, but again - whole house fires are often longer than 3 hours.
But like I said - by all means get a Fire Safe. But I still highly recommend keeping your paper wallets in an additional off-site location. Better to buy 2 non-fireproof safes in 2 locations than to buy 1 "fire proof" safe and only have 1 copy.

No doubt. It's just that we had a guy claiming Google was saying they are definitely incorporating it into Wallet and that is clearly false.
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:01:06
Again you interpret "working on incorporating it" as if it's a given that they're going to release it.
It's not the same as "are incorporating it". I've dealt with software and corporate types long enough to know that the words they used simply mean: "we're investigating it and playing with it", not necessarily that they're going to do it.

Yes, all safes will burn the paper inside of them, given a full house fire. But if the fire is small and there's only smoke and a small amount of heat, a fire resistant safe will protect against that.

That's is the standard non-answer. No promise of support. They're not even working on it. They're "looking into adding" the feature.
You know what? Apple has been "looking into adding" the feature of allowing OS X to run on 3rd party PCs for 10 years, too.

We're talking Smartphones here. The closest you can get to that (and still be viable) is something like Cyanogenmod (which is Android based).

For the future and for anyone else who is storing bitcoins on a paper wallet:
* *It is true that physical security is far easier to do than digital security.*
* However, safes do not keep things safe in case of a fire. Your paper wallet will burn on the inside of the safe if there is a house fire.
* So if you're going to keep a wallet on paper, keep a backup OFF-SITE on another paper wallet somewhere else in a safe.
* bip38 is a great additional security measure for paper wallets. Now you have the best of both worlds: physical security and digital security.

My take from all that you've said and quoted is that they're investigating it and nowhere near releasing it.
I'm sure your hopes are quite high since you were invited to be a moderator and all, but as a realist, I don't share your tremendous optimism.
I just don't like when people widely spread a rumor of something like this where they say Google is going to incorporate Bitcoin into Wallet. It's not a given or a definite or a promise. They're looking at it, as all tech companies should be.
Amazon is the one in the bunch who can afford *not* to do anything at the moment. They will, of course, have to come around, too.
It's fine for you to have high hopes. I just don't think you should lead others to believe it until Google actually announces something.
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:35:27
Yup. You were correct. Confirmation: 
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:07:12
I didn't say I didn't believe them. But looking into adding doesn't actually mean anything. I work in software. That's the term we use when we enter a ticket on a feature request which then sits on the shelf for an undetermined amount of time. Maybe we'll get to it, maybe not.
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:35:45
Yup. Confirmation: 
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:47:40
Well, if you think it's going to continue to go down, you sell now and buy at the lowest. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:01:04
Oh yeah. I forgot about that. I'll try that next time. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:33:36
If Bitcoin was simply "propety", like gold, then no problem. But it's an "investment property" so there are lots of potential regulations coming. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 00:52:14
No, it's a play on this even older thing:
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:54:16
Just wait until the next big crash and buy then. That's what I did
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:40:44
Ack..  reddit's search really does suck.
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:37:24
Ultimately, I think Google *will* incorporate Bitcoin into their Wallet, but they're nowhere near ready to announce something, no do they even know what it will look like.
They're exploring the technology, like any good tech company would.
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:19:30
The answer is to grant complete economic freedom for new ISPs so that they can compete.
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:34:20
Fireproof safes are not fireproof, only fire resistant. 
If there is a house fire, you will still get heat damage on the inside of the safe. And if there's paper in there, there's no way the safe can protect against it getting above 451ºF.
By all means, get a fire resistant safe, just don't rely on it to protect against house fires.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:35:35
Eventually all non-Libertarians will love Bitcoin. Don't worry. Just give them time.
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:21:34
for *whom*
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:06:40
This must be why "instant buy" takes 4 days to complete.
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:53:30


Yup. Sure is.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:08:04
You do realize that eventually, there will be no mining at all, right? It's not as if the cost of mining needs to actually be profitable. If it's not, people will simply wait until the efficiency returns.
But we're not at that point.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:10:30
It smells good!
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:04:04
Ok, so I signed up just to try it. It looks like there is a 48 hour waiting time that cannot be disabled.
I'm not looking for a cold wallet. I need a hot wallet that is instantaneously transferrable.
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:17:26
I'll give it a try. Not exactly what I'm looking for, but then again, maybe it is.
I liked that blockchain.info was available on a website. But this might work.
@_date: 2015-08-05 13:49:14
Is it open source?
@_date: 2015-08-05 13:56:29
So if I use the vault, does Coinbase have any possibility of accessing it?
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:11:04
I think you're trying a little too hard. I'm already a customer.
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:03:04
Thanks. That first one answers the question.
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:52:27
Sorry for your loss.  This, folks, is why people recommend 'diversify' for investments.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:47:55


Oh yes! Please more NSA spying and war!
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:43:00
They can only do this because they are provided with government sanctioned monopolies. If the government got out of the way, other ISPs would join in for competition.
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:29:02
Google would be all over the US if the government would allow them to be.
Just having Google as a competitor would help tremendously. But if you got another company like them to join in the fray, then you'd have some serious competition.


Not if you remove the power to grant favoritism to big businesses.

"'Moider" would be Jersey, not New England or London 18th century.
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:36:57
Well, ever since the Korean War, that's how it's been.
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:31:24
Given that these organizations run mostly off of executive orders, yes it does.
And veto power would go a long way in regard to the Patriot Act and other NSA enabling legislation. Stuff that Hillary voted *for* and has continued to throw her support for.
Also - who and how often we go to war has everything to do with the president.
@_date: 2013-08-31 15:27:08


Sweet. Sounds good to me.
But there's no way in the world it would happen like this, anyway.
