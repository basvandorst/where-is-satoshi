Interesting. From the bitcoin whitepaper (in case anyone else reads this)  
6. Incentive
By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned
by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides
a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending
resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

@_date: 2017-12-28 01:34:12
But the transactions fill up the block.. whichever node gets the target hash will transmit the block, as the higher block. Just because they have 51% of the network doesn't mean they can keep getting the target hash on the blocks.

Yes that's a problem but they need the funds to clear. It happened to me in 2017. The bigger issue IMO is whether or not they can withstand the network traffic of people selling out of BTC to USD when the price drops super quick (or buying when price rises). I don't try to buy and sell the dips any more because it happens so fast when the price is not very stable. People are using Tether but I never have, partly due to trust.

Are we talking about debt created by the issuance of bonds in the amount of the annual export/import defect? We do this voluntarily, we could stop if we wanted to. Bonds which have been issued have a yearly yield % which must be paid due to obligation from issuing the bonds.  
P.S. it is true that the interest payments on the bonds could be considered "printing money" although even if we WERE talking about physical money, we DO need to print new money because circulating money gets damaged/destroyed or just taken out of circulation.  
  
We all know inflation exists with fiat, this is just an example of one of the many factors in play with managing inflation.

"The success we've had with TOR, I2P, and VPN cannot be replicated with those currencies that do not rely on nodes."  
Actually this is a little ominous, but if their strategy is to attack nodes, it's the same as any other attacker. Bitcoin can't be compromised by any actor due to the hashing power required to rehash previously accepted blocks. I'm not sure what their strategy would be...
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:16:39
51% soft fork would resolve itself or a hard fork would be required. In either event, the transactions are just put back into the queue to be included in future blocks. It works great, sure there would be some distress and some selling but Bitcoin would be fine and not "super worthless".
Also, regarding double spending, you would actually need to sell them / trade them on both chain forks so that someone else is left holding the bag if/when the leading blockchain receives a block with a higher number than the block they're working on.
  
If that does not happen (the malicious 51% don't fall behind and receive a higher block), a hard fork is required, and minors would need to decide which chain to mine. 
edit: Yeah a 51% attack would probably create the possibility for other attacks which require multiple conditions (perfect storm). 
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:09:47
BCH is a sideshow. If you want to pretend that it's everything and that BTC is nothing, more power to you. That doesn't mean everyone needs to participate in the delusion.  
  
Bitcoin already exists. To address your earlier point, you're acting defensive about the Bitcoin name, when BCH took the name from Bitcoin. Just because you're able to do something (adopt the Bitcoin name) doesn't mean that others need to respect it as valid, or place value in it. I'm not saying BCH is worthless but people should be realistic, and Roger Ver is a conman. I'm not sure what you're even arguing. You asked someone to tell you the point of forking... apparently it's to give BCH supporters some incentive to trash Bitcoin and make baseless arguments.

Cost averaging is a strategy to eliminate the type of picking and choosing that you are advocating for.  
Just because you suggest a different strategy doesn't mean that you can negate the benefit of cost averaging as opposed to picking a single point in time and purchasing it all then. You don't know if the market will go up or down.

The post that I responded to was responding to a question about whether Bitcoin (BTC) was also susceptible. Everything I posted was referring to Bitcoin (BTC) not Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:34:28
It's not really susceptible to 51% attacks because of distribution of miners, but if some of these big mining pools get together and decide that they're going to attack the network with a modified client, they could create a fork (51% attack) although the people who rent/lease the miners would not be complicit if the mining pools decided to go rouge, en masse.  
Even if they did fork the BTC blockchain with a 51% attack, the correct blockchain would exist w/ less than 50% and those miners would need to reach consensus to disregard the 51% blocks so that they could continue mining rather than looping and continuing to reject the 51% blockchain.  
  
Otherwise, incentive to attack the BTC blockchain in the straightforward manner would require that an entity reprocess all of the blocks starting with the Genesis block, which is not possible by any country or organization in existence, due to the computing power.
Sorry if I'm just stating facts, you may know all this- it's just that there's a disincentive to attacking the blockchain (it costs money to attack, and mining is more profitable with a guaranteed return if you invest enough money in mining)
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:31:19
21 million Bitcoins will be "issued" in total... coins will be mined until (approximately) the year 2140, when the 21 millionth Bitcoin will be mined. So the 21million club is referring to the possible 21 million holders of Bitcoin.   
edit: mis-stated this, it's possible to have a nearly unlimited number of Bitcoin holders, each holding a fraction of a Bitcoin.
