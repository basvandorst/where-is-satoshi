If crypto has no value then shouldn’t be subject relevant taxes. That should make it even more attractive

This is HUGE. I fly with them a fair amount and they have a GREAT reputation. Everyone I meet who has flown with them speaks highly of their experience.

This is ridiculous in this day and age. Come on guys.

Platform fees are different from transfer fees. Their are a few other fast and feeless crypto currencies out their. 
You nailed the use case though. The old is gone the new has come

Great explanation!! Thank you
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:36:26
Yessir 
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:21:07
Doesn’t that mean that they will be less interested in mining because it will be less profitable?

Would anyone here use one?

Punctuation is important 
@_date: 2019-03-22 12:57:07
Completely understand his perspective. More awareness = more adoption = higher value. 
But for consumers, are the fees for buying/selling higher than services like Revolut or Coinbase?

Agree. Mainstream media have been slow to display and talk about crypto and I’ve also said to friends that they will start to see it via traditional news mediums. 
Mainstream media will give us major exposure to the masses. In my mind it’s likely that we will also here some horror stories of lost wallet keys and dolls being scammed by others more savvy. 
How ideas do you have for making things easier or more comprehensible for those who are less/not technical?

@_date: 2019-04-02 22:21:55
Good for you dude. Glad you made it through
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:58:53
No. 
Yes, but once for the medium to long term, move your Crypto’s to wallets that you have the secret keys for. 
Lastly. Welcome.

“The divisible factor is something I should research”
That’s what you offered to explain to me?
Also, you haven’t really described WHY there are 21,000,000 to begin with?
@_date: 2019-04-03 07:54:01
Ok phew! Glad is wasn’t an amount with zeros on the end of it.

As a business owner I say 1% is a MASSIVE deal!

Nice quote 
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:45:55
You nailed it. Unfortunately it’s not attractive to me because it allows ASIC miners. 
I personally don’t think that large scale mining is attractive for people nowadays in a global-warming conscious society
I wonder if BTC will be the gateway drug for the masses getting into crypto, leading them to better.

Been saying. The big money will only enter once the price is right... so far the total market cap is only inching around. When it starts increasing consistently I’ll be happier
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:43:49
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:24:24
Either way bro, worst investment we ever made! 
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:54:59
You think it’s just the big-money driving the price down so they can get in at the bottom??
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:31:55
It’s only green the first time
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:02:55
Well. Consider the overall market cap drop from 800bn to now. I should think that was sufficient, if I were ‘big money’

@_date: 2019-05-25 07:05:07
Think of you wallet like a window to you account. 
The accounts all live on the blockchain and your wallet allows you to see and interact with - receive to and send from - the currencies in your account
Your private key is unique, and generated by the wallet when you install it. It’s your key to accessing the blockchain database. If you lose you key you lose access. If someone else finds you key, they will have access to your account. 
To answer your question, someone can transfer your crypto out of your account, if they have your private key. 
You need to be the ONLY person who has your private keys. Keep them safe. You are you own bank now and you’re responsible for all the security. 
(Your public key is like an account number, you can explore the balance and history of any account on the blockchain if you know its public key. Public keys are what you give to someone when you want them to send crypto to you)

@_date: 2019-05-07 09:03:35
Do you even need the password even if you import the seed with a new wallet? 
I’m pretty sure the password is local to the wallet software and not stored in the blockchain. 
Have you tried accessing your account by importing it with your seed, into a newer wallet application?
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:21:52
Great title
