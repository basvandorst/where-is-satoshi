I'm new to bitcoin and probably understand about 1% of what is going on but I appreciated this video for the high-level ideas even if I'm still fuzzy on the details

Newbie question: does one get “compensated” for running a node and if so, how? I thought the answer is no, but this part of the article where he writes about nodes and compensation confused me:
“My concern about this [Bitcoin Cash] approach is that the cheap block space will be consumed as fast as it can be created so, in short order, we eventually end up with higher transaction costs anyways. Even worse though, in the process the network will have failed to appropriately *compensate the people that support the network by running nodes* and processing transactions.
*If those parties aren’t appropriately compensated, they will not run nodes on the network,* and Bitcoin will lose its decentralization and fundamental features as a public, permissionless, censor-resistant network.”

I get what you’re saying. I think my confusion stems from the connection he makes between ‘blocks filling up quickly’ and that leading to ‘those running nodes not being compensated.’ I understand the reward is that you can verify your own transactions without needing a third party. But how is that different with BTC and BCH?

I see; that makes a lot of sense. Thank you!
