this time though its banned on social media, has a ton of negative stigma around it etc. Where is all the dumb money gonna come from this time to make it go higher?

you realize you are investing in something with literally 0 intrinsic value, it is the epitome of "the greater fool". Yes everything is worth what someone is willing to pay for it, bitcoins only value is the confidence in it and lately that is being shattered by corruption, fraud, goverment crackdowns, bank crackdowns (no cc allowed anymore) etc. What new money is gonna come in and buy in the face of all of that? Good luck with that.

you realize when you cash out of bitcoin someone is buying it from you. It's definitely a zero sum game. Do you think the money fairy makes everyone's losing position whole again at the end of the day? Those losses you have are someone else's gain. You dont even understand how markets work and you're trying to make it sound like u have some kind of knowledge. I bet you follow some 17 year old kid with a flatbill on youtube to get your crypto picks

During the gold rush the people that made the most money were the stores selling supplies like wheel barrows, pickaxes, clothing etc. Not the actual miners, only a few of the lucky ones got rich. Do you think he doesn't understand that?

anyone who has an informed opinion aside from clueless retards screaming "HODL" is a troll to you i guess. Good luck with your dead money

would you rather hold a real asset that is a share of a company that actually produces earnings or an imaginary virtual coin that literally has 0 intrinsic value. It's not really a hard decision
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:01:13
please stop comparing stocks to retarded imaginary internet coins
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:02:18
the internet isnt an imaginary virtual coin
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:36:49
sorry my freedom of speech bothers you, move to china maybe
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:37:59
at least with stocks you're owning something real, a share in a real company that probably pays you a dividend, not some fake valueless internet virtual currency
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:24:48
Can you believe the gull of that company, not wanting worthless virtual internet coins for their products
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:45:51
you're delusional
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:21:46
