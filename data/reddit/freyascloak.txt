I hammered mine into brass sheet with alphabet stamps. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:13:05
Jewelry supply. Used a regular hammer. Brass sheet is 2.00 alphabet stamps are 20
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:14:39
Used a big book under the sheet. You could also cut open an aluminum can and write the words in with a blunt hard object. Not as durable though.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:41:16
I totally get this concept and have done it in the past. However, at the moment scaling issues have created a clogged mempool and high transaction fees, making it unusable as a currency. Fixes are just around the corner, at which time this will be an excellent idea again.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:34:36
Maybe not so mini someday soon!

Ummm...whatever. Close to retirement age and I've been in bitcoin since 2013. All elders are not idiots, you little punk.

Can someone please explain what will happen to those transactions? One of them is mine. Sent to me, unfortunately. I didn't choose the fee structure.

It may be only at approx 15% of its ultimate value. I don’t have a source for this, but you can google bitcoin forecast if you’re interested. It’s not too late, by any shake of the stick.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:09

It’s not shady, just expensive. Find guys with five star ratings and hundreds of trades.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:11:54
I believe it means someone bought all those box. Or more likely, lots of smaller buys.

Wow! You really went to a lot of work here! Your writing is excellent. I hope you don’t mind a little constructive criticism. It’s just one thing...it would’ve been nice to briefly state if each wallet was available on iPhone or Android. Thank!
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:48:45
Can anyone do this? On any computer? Is it easy to set up by someone who is not a computer genius? Do you know a link to easy to follow instructions? I have direct access to internet that can be used 24/7 at work. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:31:55
Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:45:24
Not all people who own bitcoin are tech. Some of us are middle aged men and women who researched bitcoin thoroughly and made up their own minds. 10/10 would buy again.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:10:21
Thanks Andreas. It's because of you that I believed and invested in bitcoin. It's because of you I recovered my retirement that was lost in 08. I got in late so it's not that much compared to others here, but that little bit of security means the world to me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:16
Yes. Safe and trusted for many years.

This should be submitted in its own post or on its own website. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:38:36
I'd like to know as well. Will the bitcoin appear back in the wallet of the sender?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:38:24
Those who are holding a lot have been cashing out for years. Has never triggered a crash before. As the coin becomes more valuable, smaller amounts need to be cashed out to realize gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:57:06
I have a transaction that's been stuck since December 5.  this link shows the amount of transactions waiting to clear. This is a huge problem, apparently due to tons of tiny low-fee spam transactions. This is an attack on bitcoin.
How can it be used as a currency if you can't receive your bitcoin/money? It's extremely frustrating.
Bitcoin was promised to be instant and cheap, but now it's not. How is it supposed to go to the moon if it can't even send a few dollars in a reasonable amount of time?
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:20:02
Me too. Ugh.

I love this thread. I'm a middle aged wage worker and lost most of my nest egg during the hard times of 08. More than 50% of my "wealth" is in bitcoin now - but it's only that high because of the gains I've made from it since buying in 2013 and my small weekly buys since.
My finance friends say take my profits and get out while the getting is good. But why would I do that when big players are just getting in?
I can see no other way to grow my retirement fund in the few short years I have left.
Bitcoin gives me hope for the future!
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:09:24
Yes. But you lock in the price on the day you bought it.

This is based purely on rumor. I did a search about this and could only find bitcoin-positive news sites reporting. 
I'm really interested to know what would happen - what chain of events would be set off. But it seems that perhaps the whole bitcoin/oil/Iran thing maybe a little overblown.

I don't think it would get much business, though it could be a good reason to do a press release. Maybe getting a few businesses together to run a cover story. Could bring a lot of business that way, though not by bitcoin users.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:56:42

I'm similar to you, but with a fund half that size. I started with $20 just to test the waters (at 202). A week later, bought for $1300 at 220 - another week and $1600 at 440. Considering putting in $100 a week, more if it dips. Also considering taking out 1/3 of inital deposits whenever it doubles - for instance - until I have my principal investment returned and "safe" in USD. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:07:47
Yay! Glad you're okay man!

@_date: 2013-11-17 20:23:37
So let me get this right - whenever anyone cashes in, or sells any bitcoin for cash, it's tracked here? But it only includes the exchanges listed, not all exchanges and private sales, right?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:52:03
So if it's not currency, what exactly are you buying? Shares? It seems amazing but I can't wrap my head around the investment part. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:17:22
Thank you so much for taking the time to answer me! I downloaded the bitaddress raw source code and ran it on my old windows computer unplugged from the internet (which I will never expose to the internet again).   I thought this was correct. Should I be worried still? 
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:17:43
Huh? Why do you say that?
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:23:35
Really? My credit card processor pays next day. Where does the USD into bank account part come from? Coinbase would deposit instantly? Because that would be cool.

As a first step to boosting the credibility the currency as a recognised medium of exchange, Pardigli says it has begun to accept donations in bitcoins.

Exactly my point. That whole process is excruciating. How can bitcoin grow if its that much of a hassle? Aargh.

I came here to read this. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:59:57
I'm glad to see this. I have a standing order for $100 per week on coinbase and a spreadsheet. Wish I would've started last year, but better late than never, right?
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:21:18
I use coinbase to spend and they keep a really clear ledger of transactions. Should be easy to report.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:03:46
Right. If you are the unlucky guy. I'm gonna try the Linux first. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:13:13
Are there people on local bitcoins who would buy btc randomly from someone who's never sold before? Does local btc have message boards for different areas? All I've seen is sellers. Brb gonna go look.

Thank you. I have an old desktop sitting around. In your opinion, could I run the software with windows, or do I really need to install Linux. I'm just a little concerned about Linux since I've never used it before and I'm not a techie. I think I can figure it out after that. One more question if you don't mind. I don't a printer at home. If I store the wallet on a stick, what program do I use to open it that is safe to print a paper wallet? Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:42:39
So sorry!
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:10:24

Would't this be instantaneous? I will need to contact one of the companies who do this (I believe they are Coinbase and Bitpay and maybe some others?). I'm picturing a QR Code that customers can scan on their phones and me with an app that shows immediate transmittal. Is there anyone out there with a brick-and-mortar that can verify?
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:01:18
From bitaddress, I went to github repository. So I guess I did it right! Woohoo! Thanks!

Oh dear, is Reddit where these things get decided? I'm a newbie reading everything I can get my eyes on about bitcoin, and I feel like I'm watching history being made right here and now. Whoa.

No worries, I realize there are a lot of young 'uns round here!
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:25:15
Can you just download it, unplug, get your paper addresses, then uninstall bitaddress? What are the chances that some ordinary joe just buying 10 bitcoins will have an infected computer? Are there programs running out there in the general population just hoping to access bitcoin randomly, or are they targeting people?
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:03:50
I believe a that just happened to a bunch of poor Chinese BTC investors when an exchange just disappeared overnight with 5M in equivalent cash "poof".
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:42:13
Excellent point. How many would you recommend?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:50:51
What I don't get is how can it go through the roof with exchanges having these issues. I know about private sales, and the Chinese exchanges. I wonder if they are having issues, too.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:29:16
Jeebus! You read on these subreddits: transfer to paper wallet! Now you want to bitch at someone for doing just that? Sorry but that seems unhelpful.

I don't feel greedy. I just feel like it's a drug I'm obsessed with the high and can't get enough. BTW 50 y.o. female business owner and mom.

If it wasn't for reddit I wouldn't have just made $ off bitcoin I've only owned for a week. More money I've made from bank interest in a year. I'm grateful for it.

I think (someone correct me if I'm wrong), that if you create a wallet on blockchain.info and then print out a paper wallet, even if the servers for blockchain.info are hit by a nuclear blast, you will have the private key from your paper wallet, and can import your key somewhere else, get your BTC out, and then into cold storage (sorry for run-on sentence).

Thank you for posting this article. As a newbie excited by this technology. I found one point very thought-provoking: the point about how if they internet goes down, bitcoin is rendered useless. Which brings up a bigger question: how likely is it that the internet will ever go down, and what are the ramifications of that? I have to admit I'm not educated enough to know the answer to that question. Could the internet as a whole ever go down?

I have the coinbase app and just scan the code. Otherwise yes you will need to enter the address.

What do you mean by JS? Thanks!

I'm buying because my money sits either in a physical safe and earns nothing, or in the bank earning next to nothing. Stocks confuse me. This makes sense. I'm buying in drips and drabs and holding for 15+ years. I'm gambling. From what I've learned, I think these are early days.

Not to get rich, but to make enough to cover the retirement fund I lost in the recession in '08. Sixty-five is getting closer every year, and social security isn't gonna cut it.

Why wouldn't you just print out a paper wallet from blockchain?

How can you tell how old the address is?

And what say you now?

I have used them multiple times, and been very happy with the service. ,ore expensive than coinbase, less than localbitcoins. Why do you say they are operating illegally? On his website he says he's registered with FinCen, and he's only selling coins, not claiming to be an exchange.

Ah, I get it. Thanks.

cashintocoins.com I found them from the blockchain website. So far, excellent. I used coinbase too and they turned out well after a few initial blips, but cashintocoins was awesome from the start, very quick response time.
