The age doesn't have ANYTHING to say about users in here. I'm old too, but I still don't give a fuck and love to behave childish on the net. But I still understand Bitcoin from the technical point of view and how to handle it in real life.
  
But for you I'd be happy to be called a stupid child. Because I don't care about your "18+/21+" rule dude.
  
Feel free to search for a better discussion place, good Sir.

I know that feel... This is the only thing that keeps me away from going full Bitcoin. Don't expect landlords that are a bit older to take Bitcoin any time soon. The next generation has to be in charge first, then Bitcoin COULD be the solution for everything.

Pizza. Lots of pizza.  
And weed.  
I'm sorry but I'm blunt honest here. I love both of them.  
  
I'd like to buy stuff from Amazon directly from Germany, but don't know how I can do this with Bitcoin without paying more than I would with Euro. Electronics would be cool. (A new iPod maybe).  
  
Oh, and a vacation with Expedia.

Yup. Noticed that too. Bitcoiners on Reddit are mostly assholes or people doing the "shut up we don't want reality in here"-idiots. The good guys are present too, but the idiots are making threads in here go to waste because they are greedy, don't want to spread real informations and think they are something better.
This subreddit sadly is representing a part of the whole community - and doesn't make us look good. Not a single bit at all.
 
Serious discussions only? Fine. But then take all discussions with bad news and problems for real. If this doesn't happen in here, it will make the community look like a bunch of kids who are afraid to lose money, love to troll and have no idea of what it takes to get Bitcoin go mainstream.
 
Speaking to those idiots:
Face the facts and act or just go away, throw away your private keys and start using other payment methods again. We don't need you to get Bitcoin mainstream.

Wrong. You are totally wrong my friend.
  
Merchants who don't apply with regulation laws get fucked by their tax auhtorities. Pay huge fines or even worse get the business shut down.
Suddenly people can't buy from those merchants anymore who don't bow down infront of their gov. If everyone ignores regulation, that will get everyone into huge trouble sooner or later.
   
Easy as that. Deal with it.

I think they had an insane amount of requests for the invite. Which also includes people using many different emails and ips to hopefully get many free Bitcoin. Getting all this money together could take longer than expected.
 
Imagine they let the users in early but not everyone got their free Bitcoin. A huge drama would unfold instantly because of greed -&gt; instant reputation loss.
I can understand delaying some accounts and not letting all in at once. They have to keep up their promise you know.
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:00:53
Only reveal the private key after a user agreed to a warning message which tells him to never do this on an unsecure machine.  
  
Much better solution for having the option *when needed* than being afraid of a CEO doing a theft and run.  
  
Btw: If an exchange is able to do business with big hot wallets without getting the keys leaked then it *must* be possible to keep keys for each account secure too. Most of the "We've been hacked" incidents didn't have to do with leaked keys, which everyone knows.  
  
If *the user* still manages to get his keys stolen it's the user's fault. Sounds stupid but that rule sadly still applies.  
  
We have exchanges who have to go trough audits for making sure the funds are still there. Why not have an extra audit to make sure none of the user's keys have been leaked serverside and maybe do penetration tests on a regular basis? Exchanges want to be a step ahead in the game and outnumber banks - so there's nothing that should keep them away from taking security a bit more serious.

So it looks like someone got a good amount of phone numbers from us.
I say it's
a) From a smartphone app
or b) From a hacked website which contained private informations like these and had to do with Bitcoin. Only logical thing would be a hacked mining company database. Since OP mentioned he mines, this would totally make sense.
Where and when did you guys order your miners?
Are you guys from the US?
 
I smell more bad stuff coming...
 
I personally didn't receive anything since I'm from Europe, don't mine and didn't register on mining company websites/forums(!). I only used nearly every Bitcoin related iPhone app there is.
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:15:15
Stupid thought but: Why can't exchanges provide users the remote access for private keys that are linked to their account?  
That *has* to be possible technically somehow. Current situation is not acceptable anymore.  
  
I see that exchanges using big wallets to manage user's funds doesn't get us anywhere. So give user's their own account wallets and the full control of these. Otherwise it is and will always be just an I.O.U. promise, which leads to catastrophic thefts mostly.

Encrypting the private key and setting up the wallet the proper and secure way is the most intelligent thing to do nowadays. For some newbies it might look confusing at first, but consider spending some time to understand the technique. Once you know HOW and WHY you will sleep a lot better.

You might want to take a look into paper wallets if you plan holding them for some time. Holding via Bitcoin clients on your computer sadly isn't safe anymore.

Don't want to crash the party but doesn't "Bitcoin" stand for a single Bitcoin and plural?  
That was the case some time ago when GPU mining was possible. Some users also informed other users about this common made mistake but I think it got lost and now everyone calls it a bit different.  
  
I think it's the best to go on and call it Bitcoin. No matter if you have 300 Bitcoin or 1 Bitcoin. Or 0.1 Bitcoin.  
I think following these guidelines would not be a bad thing. (And it's also not bad calling it slightly wrong as long there are guys who friendly correct others until everyone knows it.). 
  
It's just like with EURO.  
"I have 300 EURO" sounds right. 
"I have 300 EUROS" just doesn't sound right.  
  
But maybe in the end it's just me.

And I'm just sitting here clicking refresh.
No, I'm honest, I registered back then for the free money only. And I hate myself for being Circle-greedy. Realized it too late.
But I couldn't use it anyway because of my location.
I think people that already have plenty of Bitcoin AND have their Circle invite without being interested in their services should consider giving these free Bitcoin away to Newbies.
 
I have my Bitcoin stored away since some time and since I'm writing this I realize I don't need their coins. I'd be pissed as a CEO seeing the community suck my company dry. If I get my account I'd be happy to hand it to some friends who are new to it.
(Ever only gave away Bitcoin which I had bought.)
@_date: 2014-07-26 11:47:09
Not if you use a wallet application or web service which **forces** you to pay much much more.
I had to take **4 fucking days trying to send a microtransaction** without a fee because everything lower than a ~$0.50 fee wouldn't go trough. **Over and over** until it finally went trough. And this is not even a month ago. Not acceptable. And: No, a fee like 0.00001 BTC wouldn't let me send out my money.
 
If devs don't finally get their shit together, I'll be happy to stop using their products. Nothing worse than being forced to pay more than other users.
 
**Dear developers, if you want to offer serious wallet services, update it more frequently or shut down your business. Reminder: You are making money with us with your Ads and what not.**
