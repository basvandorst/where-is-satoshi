Issues of concern for us to make further explanation: Notice from the central bank, issued to third-party payment agencies, we have just received a notification by a third-party payment agencies to stop third-party prepaid channels. Bit child has not opened directly receiving channels of commercial banks, so we do not know the central bank to commercial banks receiving channel clear policies and management efforts. Once there is news, we will inform through announcements and Sina Weibo.

Just donated. Thanks for providing that opportunity. I feel like the ethic of this journalist is symbolic of a deep sickness that is present in our society. The idea of destroying another person's peace and happiness (whether this is satoshi or not) to gratify your own grasping ego I find very disturbing. If a community can come together to collectively show they value integrity above gain then I am proud to be a part of that.

I think ultimately you're not responsible for securing the owners bank account. It appears you acted in good faith. 
Are you sure the funds have been returned and not just made inaccessible to you? In Europe they are not allowed to return funds without your consent or following an official investigation. 
Your Bitcoin is gone. My guess is it's possible to have your funds returned but you might have to put in some effort. Look up central bank regulation on interac reversals in your country etc.

I would tend to agree. They are also confronted with fraud transactions quite regularly from people on localbitcoins using stolen bank account info unfortunately. as this is usually the fraud investigators first exposure to Bitcoin it understandably makes a bad first impression.
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:18:04
I looked on their site and googled purse.io support contact but I can't find a way to contact them. Just wanted to make a quick order on amazon and didn't feel like putting hours into looking for their contact and then waiting. Thought maybe someone had had a similar problem.

I have to say this really sucks and I'm taking it kind of personally. I've had nothing but good things to say about Kraken in the past. I've told anyone I got into crypto over the years to use them. I feel like I'm being cheated by an old friend. Kinda hurt and really disappointed. :/

Healthy fee market
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:16:59
They used to be really good but those days seem numbered. 
Customer service is extremely slow now and Ive personally experienced several deposit returns for no reason with no response from them for ten days. A lot of people seem to be having similar problems. 
I think possibly if they spent more time replying to customers concerns and support requests instead of PR damage control on Reddit ("oh just pm me your ticket number and we'll sort it out for you ASAP!") their service would probably be better. Ive opened two tickets and pmd my ticket number to 3 people now on Reddit and still no response. 
Seems in professional, but Like I say they used to be amazing so maybe it's just a bad time for them. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:32:24
Not sure if it's related but my fiat deposit has been quite delayed with no response from support. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:30:44
Update. I now have 3 transfers that by bank says have definitely been received by Fidor bank but have not shown up on my trading account. This is very concerning to me. Does anyone else have similar issues at present?
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:53:42
Thomas, with all due respect, this is getting ridiculous. I understand you guys are swamped. And I appreciate you reaching out on Reddit. But this will be I think the fourth time I have passed on a ticket reference to a kraken employee on Reddit over this issue and nobody has responded yet. Nobody. This problem started in FEBRUARY and I've yet to hear from anyone. I've lost money on trades, sales and margin fees. I highly doubt any of this will be recouped. 
And now I can't even withdraw my Bitcoin to secure them! Wtf?!?!
I really honestly thought Kraken was different. 
Here's my support ticket number  -again - but I have pretty much given up expecting to receive any reply other than the obligatory Reddit apologies so I'm going to start exploring other avenues to get my money out of the exchange because I feel I have no choice. 
 (most recent ticket) but this request is only in response to kraken locking down my Bitcoin withdrawals. There are 3 previous tickets that address individual fiat deposits that were declined (  and  and there is another fiat deposit that has just disappeared into thin air that I haven't even bothered creating a ticket for because of the brick wall I've been talking to for weeks. 
This is nothing personal Thomas. You have in the past responded personally to my support requests and I have nothing but good things to say about your help.
If you can do anything about this mess that would be wonderful. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:58:12
Cheers. I was speaking to you before Thomas. I have submitted 2 tickets now and deposits were since returned to my bank. I will DM the second ticket reference to you. The first ticket is referred in this second ticket. 
Edit: mine are not first time deposits. Not sure what the issue could be. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:00:56

I've also been waiting a week on 3 deposits (10k €) and am reluctant to send more now. I'm also planning to withdraw my btc from there because these things seem like red flags to me. 
I've been using kraken for 2+ years and in general I have found their customer support excellent. 
The same as OP I'm troubled by the lack of communication. Not knowing is by far the most disturbing. 
If you're having trouble keeping up with customer service just make a post on Reddit to that effect. Kraken customers are in general quite loyal and would understand and appreciate the transparency. 
It is possible because of the rapid expansion of the company that they have put their focus on growth and spread their support staff a bit thin. 
Just some thoughts. But I hope my money is released soon :/
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:11:17

@_date: 2017-03-18 10:58:56
I did yes. Sorry I updated the original post but I didn't make that clear. 
It took 3 weeks, 4 support tickets and multiple posts on Reddit. My account has been closed to deposits and withdrawals all this time with no word to me about it until now. They said they are working on it so I will update again later when I hear something. 
I get that they're overwhelmed with support requests but i have to question why so many requests to begin with and also why they don't have enough staff to handle them.

I assume people who need to change their money but don't want to go to banks have a reason for that. BTM with no I'd required is still a legitimate business and I think the deadline to change money is sometime in December. Lots of time to collect cash and get it to the bank no?

@_date: 2016-10-09 19:08:14
I dunno it was weird. Started programming as a kid in the late 70s and toyed around a good bit with cryptography in the 80s-90s but never heard of bitcoin til a friend make a huge chunk of cash out of it in 2013. Never looked back (except to wish I had heard sooner).
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:27:46
I've never had a problem before either. I've never even had to wait more than an hour though I have noticed fees creeping up gradually. 
I don't usually send from mycelium mostly from my trezor or ledger. I just used it for a demo for user-friendliness. I guess the default fee setting in mycelium is higher than normal but shit that was an expensive lesson!

@_date: 2015-02-05 15:17:35
Thoughtful and straightforwardly logical argument. It echoes my own misgivings about the currency, but still doesn't dissuade me from owning or transacting in bitcoin. For me the option to operate, at present, largely outside the sphere of governments and banking systems outweighs my misgivings, even though it is a largely symbolic act. I think many of the present shortcomings of bitcoin mentioned by the author are possibly due to adolescence and will hopefully disappear with a maturing of the ecosystem.
