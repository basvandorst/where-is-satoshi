I'm still new to BTC, but surely there is a bit of a transaction delay with trying to convert such a high number of BTC to USD and thus even when the next day ticks they could be loosing money. Again really new to BTC so correct me if I am wrong.

The harm is people with BTC ( up until now ) could and would spend there, except it was dollars instead of BTC. So their user base most likely doesn't expand, but rather makes user with BTC more happy to shop there than before. Therefore the harm comes to the fact that BTC one day is worth $XXX and the next day it will be less or more thus it's a bit of a gamble.
With that said I think they will have to start accepting them since TigerDirect has, which is only good for us. :)

Try giving some coins to your friends ( consumers ) who are not sure what they are and take the time to explain it to them. It's a little bit more complicated than money after all.

The link explains in more detail, but pretty much I made an easier way to join/create Terraria Servers. Right now you can only join games if  you know the IP Address. My application makes it so if you create a server with it it gets added to my server list and thus people can easily join it. Let me know if you have any other questions!
