Most of the hate for Coinbase on this subreddit is pure politics. Coinbase supports big blocks, this subreddit supports small blocks. Therefore anytime a post comes up about Coinbase there are plenty of shills in the ready to shit all over them. The same thing happens on that other bitcoin subreddit if you bring up Segwit or Lightning Network. Plenty of shills over there ready to plant FUD in the minds of anyone who asks about them.

"Rest of world can ignore the hype". Using that logic can americans ignore the FUD next time China bans bitcoin?

My dad got hit with ransomware a few years ago. Had to pay $200 in BTC. He hated computers before, he hates them more now. He has asked several times in the last few months if now is a good time to invest in Bitcoin.

Yeah but optional to the user because the layers below it don't require it. So a user in Thailand paying a user in Vietnam is not presented with CoinBase's KYC procedure. But a business in New Mexico sending payment to Vietnam using CoinBase will. CoinBase keeps it's users compliant. None CoinBase users are not impacted.

Can you provide a case where someone was charged with insider trading under these circumstances? If I set up a two-bit gold exchange and then decide to set up a silver order book, none my employees can buy or sell silver shortly before or after I open up my order book? That doesn't pass the sniff test.

Insider trading does not apply to commodities in the United States.

How is it insider trading if they were not selling Coinbase stock? I thought insider trading was for trading on your own company's stock. Would the NYSE get in trouble if their employees were trading an IPO stock?

Other commodities markets are not regulated in this way. If I open up a wheat exchange, my employees and I can trade all the wheat we want before and after launching the exchange.

It's like stealing a few twenties out of your parent's wallet. Flushing one down the toilet, then pocketing the rest.

Bingo. Hundreds of thousands of newbs saw cheap bitcoins and thought they hit the lottery. Coinbase had to shut down trading. Yay for Bitcoin. /s

This is what I don't understand! Futures were announced a month in advance. We knew exactly when they would be launched. Why Coinbase didn't do this IS sketchy as hell. This is a massive failure of upper management. I have a hard time believing Brian Armstrong was acting in bad faith and I'm confident he will take appropriate action. This isn't a mistake you make twice. Somebody's head should roll for sure, but this is NOT insider trading.

Exactly. There is no moral to this story. Someone got out pissed in a pissing contest. Big deal.

Cool story. I traded some dollars for interhet monopoly money a few years ago. Last month I trade interhet monopoly money for some MRE's on    
Earlier this year I traded interhet monpoly money for a trip to Europe on  It was a great trip. Merry Christmas!

Solid analysis. Hodled through the '13 crash, I'm hodling through this one. Thankfully I cashed out some a few weeks ago to pay taxes. But I don't have any I can risk to put back in, and certainly not while its falling like a knife.  I'll wait for it to bottom out, stabilize for a month or two, then put some back in. I do know one thing - every time I panic sell/buy it bounces in the other direction hard.
