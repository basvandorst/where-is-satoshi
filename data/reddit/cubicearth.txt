Okay, interesting. Bitgo does have a service where they keep 2 of 3 keys though, I think.

There is not 'one thing and one thing only' which distinguishes Bitcoin from what came before it.  Bitcoin has brought many  advancements to the fore.  Censorship resistance is obviously an important property, [but as I've written about before]( censorship resistance is not absolute, it is a matter of degree.  And censorship resistance has costs, which in the case of Bitcoin tend to be the inefficiency of massive redundancy, global broadcast, and PoW to some extent, and possibly through high fees and slow confirmations.  To the extent that we, as a community, are paying for more censorship resistance than we need makes us vulnerable to competition.  
What threats Bitcoin needs to be resistant or immune to are not a settle matter.  There is middle plenty of middle ground between PayPal and a system that hopes to be immune to state-sponsored cyber attacks.  I would love it if such a system was possible, but I don't think it is with today's technology.  Bitcoin must win hearts and minds to survive, the major component of which is growing the user base.  Trading a a little bit of Bitcoin's perceived invincibility (sacrificing a modicum of security) to gain users, hearts and minds, absolutely increases the chances of Bitcoin's long term survivability.

I think there is a flaw in the way you view decentralization - or at least what it can and cannot offer - if I understand the context you are using it in.  No matter how 'decentralized' mining may be, even if it is the ideal of a bit of hashing power in every home in the world, political organization of that hashing power cannot be stopped.  People could choose to join together to enforce certain principals and ideas, which could include 'enforcing' court decisions, laws, etc.
Specifically, I don't think 'decentralization' can stop the kind of organization that you worry could do what you suggested.

What is that? As far as I know it doesn't exist yet.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:13:11
A true statement. It is also important to consider the context, absolute costs, and relative costs. 4MB base blocks, with SegWit would mean a worst cast of 16MB blocks. 16MB would be an attack block though, which may happen once or twice, but not for a month. So we can conservatively put the total at 14MB blocks worst-cast over a month, which would be 60 GB / month to sync a full node.
Do you have a cost estimate for that, in terms of USD? It needs to be compared to transaction fees in USD terms.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:06:39
It is silly to seriously state that Bitcoin "is not money". Money is whatever people think it is and use as such. Things are priced in USD as a mater of convenience, but that can easily change. I agree that Bitcoin is not currently stable enough to be useful as a unit of account, but that almost certainly will change. It is a matter of the coins becoming more widely distributed, they technology maturing, and inflation rate (mining rewards) decreasing. There are countries out there who's currencies are less stable than Bitcoin, and that doesn't make it any less "money".
As far as things being priced in gold? That was basically the case right up until the USD went of the gold standard (at least for the USD). The big experiment has actually been the last 50 years, since we left the gold standard, and the results are open to debate.
I agree that many people are in Bitcoin for investment/speculation, but it is key to realize that it is not based on the greater fool theory. This technology has revolutionary potential. Bitcoin is absolutely the leading contender to become the first truly global currency, primarily because of network effects, both technological (installed codebase) and financial (deepest liquidity of any crypto coin(trust!)).
Sure, "Buy the Dip", "All in", and "Hodl" are pretty silly memes, but they are also about reinforcing a mindset and belief system. Belief is central to any money anyway, so it is not unreasonable.. "In God we Trust", etc etc.
Also, for Bitcoin to hit a high price of $20k, it is necessary for long term holders (like Loaded, with over 40k BTC), to not sell. It could be they are not selling for ideological reasons, but there are certainly other early adopters who are not selling at that price because they believe it will go much higher in the end. These are not clueless gamblers, these are people with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on the line who have spend thousands of hours thinking over and studying the fundamentals of the system, and concluding it and its growth prospects to be sound. Bitcoin hitting $20k is proof that this group of people is convinced it will go higher. So once that proof is attained, as it now has been, buying at $12k, at $10k, or $5k can been seen, in a sense, as a good deal. It could fail. But it's a binary outcome. HODL is about the necessity of people being detached from the current market valuation of the coin. Let's check back in 5 years when most websites (globally) that accept payment will be on the lightning network. Currency traders do buy the Yen or Rubies when they drop in value (below their fundamentals). But we all know that fiat currencies are not good long term investments. Bitcoin is challenging that paradigm by attempting to be a deflationary currency. It is a radical concept. It is understandable that people want exposure to the experiment.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:16:05
I agree. In this case, 'cutting them out' just means the overall network topology becomes tighter and more direct, which is a good thing. I was just suggesting the little guy as a bridge in the context of the network being partitioned, and pointing out that there is a financial incentive to be that bridge. I think there will be multiple routes from any point to any point, provided an end point is willing to have more than one channel themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:29:19
I think when people say what you are saying... it means they don't have enough BTC. If people don't have any money, saving is a very good idea, especially if the currency is deflationary. But at some point, once you have saved 'enough', it can feel nice to spend some of the dividends.
@_date: 2016-04-06 20:45:02
That's off topic.  I was simply answering your question, the nature of which suggested you didn't understand that Bitcoin is one of many systems that are each vying for the top spot.  Bitcoin is open source and can be freely copied.  99% of it's market cap is due to network effects, and the belief that it's head start is unlikely to be surmounted.  In fact, we all know that if Bitcoin could be redesigned from scratch, we would do many things differently, and every core dev would agree.  But alas, part of maintaining confidence (and preserving the network effect) means maintaining backward compatibility, not having downtime, and not wasting people's investments in time and equipment, even if the technical foundation they built upon was flawed.  Bitcoin's monopoly is not technical, it's just critical mass.  If we lose the critical mass, one of many competitors will be happy to claim the No. 1 spot.
That's why we have a "window".
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:26:03
I live in the US. I pay $50/month for internet, which is pretty standard. I have a 1/TB month bandwidth cap. As a fraction of the my total cap, that 60GB/month would cost $3. My ISP, which is a total ripoff, charges $10 for each 50GB over the 1TB, so if I were paying at that exorbitant rate, it would cost $12 for the extra bandwidth.
In most cases, that 60GB/month wont actually cost the user anything directly, because it will be under there pre-paid allotment. A two hour Netfilx movie is 6GB, and people watch lots and lots of movies without paying 'extra' for bandwidth.
But let's say $5 a month in costs to run a node. I don't see how that is a larger cost to users than $10 transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:25:42
You can be proven wrong not just in theory, but by looking at current real world behavior. While holding fiat itself does not generate positive returns, holding many types of assets as investments do generate steady and predictable returns. So why are people buying lambos when they could just buy stock in utility companies or forest land or something else and become wealthier over time?
People are not just interested in the accumulation of money, but also in the enjoyment of the short amount of time we each have to live.

Probably 10EH of that 15 is in less than 100 locations, and in no more than three countries. A state-sponsored attack doesn't look like the CIA building a giant hashing operation, it looks like one or two or three government's working together and sending police to each data center, along with some government computer people to redirect the hashpower in a direction of their choosing.
We have not bought nearly as much security as we have paid for, unfortunately.

Proof of work is a pure economy of scale. It is basically the most efficient and most secure solution for everyone to use one master time stamping service.
As for other 'tokens', it is unclear to me why I would prefer to earn anything other than the universally accepted money for services I provide. 'Filecoin' will surely have an equivalent value in Bitcoin, and it would save a conversion set to just be paid and pay in BTC for file hosting, rather than some other token. As for any token that has counter-party risk, such as one 'backed' by something tangible, there is just no reason to have a blockchain in this instance. Why pay for a blockchain to avoid censorship when the underlying assets could just be seized? It would be cheaper just to have a database in such an instance.
It is true there are many interesting projects being worked on in the alt-coin arena, but any blockchain software *must* be 100% open-souce. The code can just be forked to cut out the token. The only value capture, in the long run, can come from network effects. That is why it is likely that Bitcoin will eventually absorb almost any good alt-coin project in the long run.

It is not about an arbitrary address per se that is interesting. The question is when will you be able to send a small amount of money to an arbitrary recipient, and I think the answer is basically as soon as the recipient sets up a lightning channel of their own. Okay, perhaps it is not totally ready TODAY, but it should be ready for early adopters  on main-net within a matter of weeks. It is going to take years of research before the network works like a finely tuned machine, but very soon I expect to see a flood of websites and services that accept lightning payments.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:53:03
Even today, most people (in the world) would say you haven't sent the money until the Bitcoin was 'cashed out, into fiat'. If you don't consider LN transactions to be the same as sending/receiving Bitcoin, how about when its up and running, I can send you 0.1 BTC on chain and you can send me 1 BTC over the LN!

There are many reasons, and most relate to remaining in control. It could enjoy the seignorage income; they could always ask for money from the people in the form of taxes, but why ask when you can just take? I think it also pushes the economy to become more highly industrialized than it otherwise would, which is important for a country to maintain a strong military. But just because something is good for a nation-state does not mean it is good for you, for I, or for the greater good. It may be so, but not necessarily. I would like the world to be less 'industrialized' myself.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:01:17
You have to go a step deeper and look at why people believe what they do. Bitcoin has the most liquidity and largest network effects, and many people think this advantage will only build with time. They believe that money is more valuable the more widely accepted is it, and that this is self-reinforcing cycle. I tend to think that way myself. It is not just that Bitcoin is valuable because people think it is; they think it is because it has by far the largest economy in what is typically a winner-take-all situation.
I agree that alt-coins have value because people think they do, but sadly, that is typically based on misunderstandings of the underlying fundamentals. Take your example. I believe that you think something that gives 5%- 10% passive income is cool and worth a lot, but perhaps you haven't thought about where that money is coming from? Or maybe you have, and just understand that it is pyramid scheme who's day will eventually come. Get in, take a bunch of peoples money, and get out. All without providing any overall value to the world.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:35:34
You have some good points.


Yes, trade is certainly a good thing to measure. I am concerned with current economic measures that are based on coercion, and the idea that because powerful institutions don't value something, that the weight it's given in economic calculation is diminished. I see this as relating closely to externalities (which are external by choice, or at least omission). Or look at people who are living off the land, living in nature. Their economic output is considered to be very low, but they may see their clean river as priceless, and perhaps are thinking about 10 generations in the future. The industrial world just sees resources to exploit in the short term. I am not saying the a deflationary monetary system will fix everything, but the current system has enough serious shortcomings that I am happy to try to invert it as an experiment.


Yes, I agree. But it is very interesting: the currency appreciation will be greater than some things, but less than others. Perhaps it will help to focus our output into things that matter more. Overall we may do less, but the overall quality of investments and production would be higher. In terms of just goods and services though, there would still be supply and demand constraints in effect. It is not like everyone could just sit around doing nothing an getting rich holding their coins. In that context, there still be inflation, since if no one was working, there would be very few goods and services to consume.


I can see how, as measured by conventional thinking, yes, the economy would shrink. But I maintain that the conventional measures are fucked beyond belief. In a conventional sense, yes, I do hope the economy shrinks. It is not helpful to conclude 'Deflationary money will shrink the economy', simply because in general, people would associate that with being 'bad', since we are all taught that a growing economy is a good thing.
One thing I have always found interesting though is that people don't inherently have any respect for the economy. You might not little, because you want a clean world for everyone. You might not steal even if you know you wouldn't get caught, just out of a sense of doing the right thing. And you might pay more for 'fair trade' fruit because you are thinking about the well fare of the other people at the far end of the supply chain. But I really can't think of anyone who makes any kind of moral or ethical choice because it is 'good for the economy'. People might joke about it, but that is it.
I think this 'ad' gets to the point - 
The economy is akin to measuring income, where as I think measuring wealth is more meaningful. If I buy a new car and crash it the next day, this good for the economy. The broken window fallacy is alive and well.

Bitcoin ≠ Wealth
Bitcoin = Money
Money is just one small part of global wealth. Land, factories, buildings, companies, intellectual property, etc. are a much larger component. 
Besides, wealth can grown under the current system. Just look at land as an example. You could make the same argument. If someone owns 100 acres of farmland, every year they could sell their crop and use the profits to an addition 5 areas. Eventually they would all of land in the world.
A deflationary monetary system just adds money to long list of forms of wealth that can grow with time. Wealthy people already have many sophisticated forms of investing available to them. Have you noticed that over the last 40 years, global wealth is becoming extremely concentrated? It has not been happening under a deflationary monetary system.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:49:54
I largely agree. I have some ETH as a hedge. It is possible BTC doesn't take the prize, but I really think in the long run 90% of money will be captured by one protocol. If ICOs get to the point of just being like regular securities, with legal backing, that is a different story. I am thinking about the market for cryptoassets that have no counter party risk.
The only value the can be captured by an open-source protocol is via the network effects. Thinking about a FileCoin, if the network grew very large and the coin became 'valuable', what would that mean for me as a user? Did devs and early investors become rich? That would suggest that I am paying more to use the service than if not one was profiting off it. If the network is huge, and I am only paying 0.5% percent more than the marginal cost of running the hardware, the devs can probably capture that value. If it 5% or 10% more expensive than the forked version that runs on BTC or doesn't have a big pre-mine, it will likely be forked. Although if the particular network effects of that niche are so strong as to make starting a new network very hard, it is possible the value capture percentage could be higher.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:18:15
You are making some unfounded assumptions. First, there is not agreed on way of measuring the 'economy'. GDP is beyond fucked as a measure. I would argue the 'size' and 'quality' of the economy is in the eye of the beholder. So overall 'shrinkage' is not an absolute issue, or even if you have a metric by which you assed shrinking to happen, that it would be a bad thing.
Also, it seems your definition of 'rich people' seems to be somewhat narrow. The vast majority of wealth is head in forms other than money. Land, factories, ships, buildings, etc. Just because Bitcoin's deflation means its value will increase, that doesn't mean it will increase faster than the value of other things. If you hold the coin, perhaps your wealth will grow at 1% a year. If you give up the money in exchange for shares in the next Amazon, your wealth may grow at 15% per year.
One thing that I am hoping to see with a deflationary currency is that once someone earns some money, they can actually just hold on to it without feeling pressure to spend or 'invest' it.

Great article, u/LudvigBitcoinArt ! I agree with most of your points and I as well believe in the promise of the Lightning Network. Having the world's transactions all on-chain would never work.
However, we still have to have a chain that is capable of processing a non-neglisble number of transactions itself. To extend your analogy, we may well be running a LAN network today, but given the current congestion AND the long-term need for larger base blocks, it seems the least we could do is upgrade from 10/BaseT to Gigabit.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:51:30
You make good points.
Hubs will be needed at the beginning to help bootstrap the network. However, just as with arbitrage between exchanges, individual users are incentivized to bridge any gaps in the network. If there are two hubs that are not connected to each other, it would be a lucrative opportunity for someone to open up channels with each hub and become a 'hub for the hubs', since people can charge fees for helping to relay payments.
I admit I know very little about the 'routing problems', although it seems like it would be quite easy to solve if centralized servers were used. Nodes can inform the routing servers of who they want to pay, and the servers can suggest a route. I know in the long run we don't want the network depending on centralized servers, and there is work being done to avoid solve routing in a decentralized way. My point is just that we can take advantage of centralized services in the short term to help get the system off the ground.
A think it is very likely that exchanges will start offering to open up lightning channels between them and their customers, and thus serving as the first major hubs.

It's an unbroadcast transaction spending from a multi-signature account, of which you control one of the keys. Since you know there is money it that cannot go anywhere without your signature, you have a guarantee that the unbroadcast tx will confirm (or at least that if will not not confirm due to lack of underlying funds). The tx cannot be double spent.

There is a quick fix - raising the *base* block size, which is such an easy software change that could be rolled out very quickly.

Perhaps NEO is a system that will deliver lots of value to the world, and the early holders will make lots of money. That would be fine.
My point is that the system's root value proposition cannot be generating passive income. That is not something that everyone can benefit from. Passive income is merely a value transfer mechanism. It is the transfer of wealth, not the generation of wealth. Passive income does has place in the world of finance, I am not trying to argue there is something structurally wrong with the concept itself.
The pyramid aspects of alt-coins are that people think their value is that 'they go up', or generate 'passive income'. In the end, they actually need to solve a real problem to hold their value once they have reached a saturation point - once there is no more greater fool. I understand almost all of them claim to solve a problem, but I believe that most of the problems can be solved, in the long run, by Bitcoin at a lower cost and with greater security and liquidity. In the end, I expect most alts to collapse into BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:21:38
You think NEO has real value because it can generate passive income? That logic is about as circular as a perpetual motion machine. Or maybe I am I missing the point? If we just gave NEO to everyone in the world, I suppose we would all have passive income and everyone could retire!

Not with the contracts the article described. There could potentially be a more complex scheme, with some kind of 'override' signature the oracle could provide within a specified time frame, but in that case the bet wouldn't be able to fully settle (confirm) until that time frame had elapsed.
In the future, I would expect there to be oracles that have a legally-sanctioned role to play. Their published outcomes would be subject to review via the standard legal process, and perhaps people could even take out insurance against the oracle publishing an incorrect outcome. The oracle itself would have to be insured so that claims against it could be fully paid in the case of an erroneous publication.

It is a great question, but it is not easily knowable or provable.  But the miners were sitting right there in the room, the first step would be to ask them.  Maybe you could even get tours of their warehouses to confirm some rough numbers.  And the electric companies know how much energy the farms are consuming, which could give you a pretty reasonable estimate for the hash power at a given location.  It would be some serious sleuthing, but you could probably figure out the location and approximate hash-power of every farm that was consuming 1 MW or more.

I was confused by that part of Greg's explanation as well. Calling u/nullc ?
My understanding isn't that strong yet, but SegWit offers scaling potential in several different ways.
• By offering a strong solution for malleability, it enables powerful systems such as lightning to reach their full potential.  So in this case it is laying the groundwork for scalability.
• By separating out data fields that are currently combined in a single structure, it makes lite-node, SPV type wallets easier to support, as in less data will have to be transmitted to them.  I think the idea is to not send them signature data since they do nothing with it now.  I'm fuzzy on the details.
• By being clever about hardfork / softfork rules, it works around the 1-MB limit.  In this respect it is not an efficiency improvement, but simply a way to avoid a hard fork.  This could be seen as a negative in a sense ... it's a way to force larger blocks upon nodes without their consent.  But either way, it seems that transaction throughput will be raised, somewhere between 2x and 4x, and total block size - inputs/outputs + sigs - will be somewhere between 2MB and 4MB.

The part of it that is a great plan is many people were not interested in seeing the part of experiment where fees got very high, as they are now. I hope Bitcoin pulls through this, but there is no need to be in the situation we are in now. It is certainly possible that fees could rise very high even with larger blocks, and that would truly be a great problem to have. The mining revenue would be phenomenal, and "spam attacks", whatever they are, would be multiples more expensive to pull off than they are today.
I am all for the lightning network, as I have been since Joseph and Tadge gave the first presentation about it at S.F. Bitcoin Dev meetup. Just like with Bitcoin itself, I knew within moments of hearing about the concept that it would work. However, it is not clear yet that LN will succeed in taking over quickly. It may take many years for the network to become large and stable, and it is silly to try to constrain the block size to 'push' people onto LN before it is ready.
Blocks should be as large the network can safely support, provided there is adequate fee pressure. If blocks are too large, it would lead towards centralization. On the other hand, artificially constrained capacity also damages the network.
The Lightning Network would still be developed and implemented even if the base block size was 4MB or 8MB right now.

Not that it directly relates to digital signatures, but I'd like to use this moment to point out that one-time-pads are theoretically unbreakable.

Yeah, the capital gains count against the exemption.  If you have $0 in earned income, you could have something like $36,000 in capital gains and pay 0% on it.  Any gains in excess of $36,000, and you will have to pay 15%.

And what happens if the network doesn't function so quickly, say over the course of 3 minutes instead of 30 seconds?  I can think of no problem other than a new block is found in that time and propagated faster, effectively orphaning the block with "very different transactions".  But that is not an absolute result, just a somewhat more probable one, and one that can be offset with appropriate fees, in the sense that the miner can be incentivized to try again to make a block with those different txs.  Eventually a block will propagate before another is found, and those txs will be included in the chain.

It is every individual's right to decide whether or not to accept one thing in exchange for another.  Collectively, it is the network's choice whether or not to accept certain coins, or to choose to value them at all. By the 'network' I am referring to the emergent choice of many individuals.  Keeping this context in mind, it must be understood that one possible, probable outcome is that the Bitcoin community decides to refuse to accept coins who's ownership is no longer certain due to compromise of the underlying crypto, on account of quantum advances or otherwise.
tl;dr:  If quantum computers render Satoshi's coins up for grabs, the community could blacklist them.

The centralization equilibrium would be the same, but the absolute number of transaction would be 20x higher, 60 TPS rather than 3.  Agreed that is still not 'enough', but it is still 'better' than keeping it at 1MB.  Besides, the proposal is about buying time.  Everyone, Gavin included, acknowledges the fork is a band-aid, something temporary to avoid the network being overloaded while other strategies, such as the Lightning Network are brought online.  Furthermore, seeing the switch to 20MB as the experiment that it is, if it is wildly successful, with folk's centralization concerns not coming to pass, than perhaps it would be easy to convince the community to up the blocksize in the future, say to 200MB.   
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:56:42
I agree that the Bitcoin codebase should be kept as simple as possible, and your suggestion sounds reasonable.  I threw the bandwidth-throttling idea into my OP because I wanted to suggest an example of some low-hanging user-interface fruit that would make running a full node more palatable for the average user.  There are many techniques for limiting bandwidth, but in order to get as many people running nodes as possible, it should be very easy, even for people who are not technically inclined.
Despite the network carrying more transactions than ever, Bitcoin Core is close to becoming a very-usable, 'normal' piece of software to run.  The bootstrap phase is already only one-night procedure, pruning is on its way to free up hard drive space.  Add in some easy (or even default) bandwidth throttling tools, and it would be reasonable for average computer users to keep a node running.

Yes, I am familiar with, though I don't know all of it's details.  The goals of both methods are the same: rapid block propagation.  As far as I know, the process I described uses an entirely different strategy, and the relay network itself could use what I have described (although in that case it may be or marginal benefit).   I think the relay networks main speed advantage comes from sharing  most of a block's contents beforehand.  In practice that has been worked out, but I have heard concerns that such can become a vector for censorship.
What I have described parallelizes the transmission of a whole block, so that it may be passed simultaneously though many small pipes, and then recombined on the other side.  Like bonded channels in a cable modem, maybe?
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:15:54
Exactly.  That is the point I was arguing for.  It is not clear at all that 20x is needless dangerous.  If it does end up harming the network, the harm will only be temporary, as computers and networks get faster.  The strain of 20MB blocks today would be very similar to the stain of 1MB blocks on the network back in 2009/2010.

I would think this could be part of a system to largely solve the latency issues with pushing blocks - and large blocks - through the great firewall of China.  The following is how I imagine such a system could work, at least for collecting externally found blocks and getting them into China quickly.  The system could potentially be designed to be bi-directional, or there could be a parallel system "pointing" in the other way, to quickly relay blocks found inside China to the outside world.
External nodes would be geographical distributed outside China, and Internal nodes would be geographical distributed inside China.
Each external node (outside the great wall) will be specially configured so that it does the following upon receipt of a new block:
1) Checks the header for PoW but skips validation
2) Cuts up the block in to 5-KB fragments, starting from the top.  The final fragment would likely be less than 5-KB.
3) Assigns each fragment a random sequence number, with no duplication.
4) Forwards fragments sequentially, starting with the lowest numbered fragment.  Each fragment has a header that includes it's sequence number and the final two bytes from the full block's PoW hash.
Inside the great wall, there is a corresponding internal relay node for each external node.  Each internal relay node is linked one peer on the outside (the external node), and to an one internal "master node".  The master node would provide a mining pool with a reference blockchain, and what the pool would be doing work upon.
Relay nodes
1) Accept fragments (which each have a sequence number)
2) Immediately forward the fragments on to the master node
The master node then assembles the fragments in order and validates the block.

I agree with that statement in general, and it is certainly true for purchases of even thousands of coins.

That is not correct.  It is perfectly acceptable to deploy a hard fork in the face of known disagreement.  Some people may be left behind.  I, nor anyone else in this system, is compelled to run any particular version of software, and no one has to wait for any agreement to do anything.

Peter, that is not a forthright answer, and I know it is intentional because you are a smart dude.


That is pure correlation.  Where is the control group?  If we had cut block sizes over time those trends still would have continued.  Other variables are dominating that trend, such as generic economies of scale and the proliferation of non-full node wallet options.   Of course larger blocks has small centralizing pressure, but the truth is we don't know if they are responsible for 1% of the centralizing pressure or 20%.


Simplistic speculation is trivial.  I agree :)  But this is a complex system, and relevant variables include incentive structures and other social considerations.  Worst case behavior currently results in a dead Bitcoin.  People aren't even talking about the likely hood of attack or what Bitcoin must be designed to withstand.  No system can withstand every attack, so they must be designed to withstand likely attacks.
Many of the dev's are skeptical that Bitcoin can work at all.  They see attack and failure everywhere.  That is good to a point, and helps everyone to understand risks and failure modes, but at some point we must accept the risks and move forward.  If you can't handle the risk, use gold and paper money.  The only way to guarantee that Bitcoin won't fail is to not have Bitcoin at all.  Reduce block size to 1 KB and reduce block interval to 1 block per day.  Much more secure.  Should result in many more nodes.  Mining will become much more decentralized.
We don't have any recent information about what a hardfork roll-out would look like, so that would be useful anyway.  As for seeing how node counts and mining centralization, they are going to continue to primarily vary according to other variables.

Another way to understand the increased capacity is looking at absolute transaction throughput.  Bitcoin's maximal throughput is slightly over 7 tps at 224 bytes per tx.  With SegWit, the theoretical maximum moves closer to 10.5 tps, which is a 50% improvement.  Neither of those numbers hold under practical usage patterns though, so something like 8 tps in actual usage might be all we can expect to get from SegWit alone.  That matches what nullc is saying.  I just want to make sure people didn't think "4 MB blocks" and  think it would mean 4x as many tps as we currently have.  No.  The absolute limit would be about 10.5 tps.
Thanks to aj for walking me through some of this!

True enough, Bitcoin Core does not download data too far ahead of the point to which it has validated.  Since validation is CPU limited, the downloading will indeed occur at a slower rate than downloading via torrent, but only because the torrent is NOT validated in any way.  
Downloading the blockchain obviously does nothing for security.  It must be downloaded AND validated.  So while it may download faster via torrent alone, considering the only meaningful use of the blockchain includes validation as well, the quickest way to a meaningful use of the blockchain is not torrent + bitcoin core, but rather bitcoin core itself.

So lets say a miner had a very unconventional acceptance policy, and they were at a small disadvantage of having their blocks orphaned, but let's say it was 10%.  Wouldn't they just need to charge more for those transactions to make up for the difference?

I don't think that is wrong or avoidable.

You are referencing an arbitrary period in history to justify your reasoning, which is understandable.  Using that same logic, let me make two points.
1) At the time the 1-MB restriction was in put in place, that broke the social contract.  And at that time, 100% of people were using the old bitcoin.  So at the time, it was a massive affront, according to your logic, and Bitcoin survived just fine.
2) If we make the change, just wait long enough and your argument will fade away.  Two years after the change, you will be able to say "but only 10% of people signed up under the old rules".
And I'll point out an appreciable percentage of people who joined in the 1-MB blocks era were under the assumption that the limit would be raised.  While neither you nor I can cite actual numbers with certainty, it is sure there are sizable camps on both sides.

That is just wrong.  A super-majority yes.  Every single participant in the network, no.  How much is enough?  The truth is no one knows, but most guesses are between 75% and 90% for things go smoothly.  The remaining minority will either continue on on their own, with a vastly smaller group of people participating, diminished coin value, etc., or they will jump ship and re-join the majority.  They may be some holdouts on the original network, but they will just be a trace.  It may be an ideological disaster for those holdouts, but for everyone else, things will be just fine.

That is the ultimate end-state of the lightning network, but that doesn't mean it can't be successful in other ways in a less refined condition. It is perfectly reasonable right now for someone to put $100 in Eclair and then use it to make 10 lightning transactions over the course of a few weeks as they empty the channel.
They would have made only 2 on-chain tx, and not 10, and they can benefit from instant confirms on all 10 of the transactions! Who want's cold coffee!

It is a Poisson process and there is no guarantee of timely validation, I agree with that.
But there are many different use cases for almost every order-of-magnitude interval in transaction speed, so I disagree that nothing is gained by a 10x speed up in average wait time.  Consider buying something like a new computer,where it would in fact be reasonable to wait three minutes for the transaction to clear, but no one would stand around for 30!
And saying "it doesn't really harm if you get your package a few days later anyways." is just silly.  I don't think Amazon agrees, and there are cutoff times by which to order if you do want something delivered two days later.
Another example, lets say you were adding minutes to a prepaid phone because your balance just hit zero.  You want to make a phone call.  Waiting 5 minutes for balance to be topped up is no biggie, but waiting 50 could be a hassle.

You're correct.  Nielsen's Law seem seems to be the most relevant to the centralization concerns, as it describes bandwidth growth through time.

Also, "long" validation times for large blocks have been cited as a drawback of Gavin's proposal.   Validation time certainly would scale with 1 / (Moore's Law).

I am not a fan of currency devaluation myself, but I think there is a flaw in your analysis. The very poor, while dollars may make up the majority of their savings, the value of the dollars are small in comparison to the value of their income and other possessions. Basically, they have almost no dollar savings to devalue. And then there are many poor people with a negative net worth - those that are in debt. Debts that are denominated in dollars. Inflation - nominally speaking - reduces the burden of such debt.
I'm not defending inflation, but everything has pros and cons. In backing a deflationary currency, we should try to understand the true implications.

The point I was trying to make is that "computer capability, generally, is increasing exponentially", and that will, with time, offset ANY centralizing effects that could be attributed to larger block sizes.   Broadband capacity is following is own growth trajectory, though apparently it's growth rate is slower than the CPU curve.

What he didn't mention is that node count doesn't in any way indicate relative levels of support. The reason is that one person could be running thousands of nodes to give the illusion of support. It's the reason why Bitcoin uses proof of work..  Look up Sybil Attack for more information.

Node count is subject to false positives, but not false negatives. This can be confusing, but the logic holds. Any number of nodes for a given implementation could be controlled by a single individual. If that person were smart and sophisticated, they would makes the nodes be geographically distributed and they would bring them on- and off-line slowly, to avoid the appearance of a sudden surge. So nodes - any number of nodes - are neither evidence of any true support at all, nor evidence of some relative amount of support vis-a-vis another implementation. What can be safely concluded is that the absence of any nodes for a given implementation is a clear signal of that version has no, or negligible support.
Said another way: Absolute node count for any given version means there MAY be up to that many legitimate nodes, but despite a high count, the true number could be close to or at zero.

Please keep in mind that not everyone shares the same vision for Bitcoin.  Even among people who want it to succeed, their could be enough difference in what their respective visions of success look like that each could reasonably view the others' plans as an attack.

Bitcoin is not a scientific project.  It is a political-economic experiment.  Belief, faith &amp; trust are what back it.  Greg Maxwell once 'proved' that something like Bitcoin couldn't exist.

Sure, and that is the same false-choice dressed in a different skin.

The law is going to be with us in some form, but perhaps the burden of proof will shift, or maybe it will take international agreement to freeze people's funds (true agreement, not just the U.S. issuing decrees to dollar handling banks).  And further, freezing funds is different than seizing funds.
And even if Bitcoin had to suffer some legal indignities, there is still the transparency.  It's not that I wish these things to become true - it's that many people fail to realize that Bitcoin has many possible success models, it's not just "A or B".

There is always a cost-benefit relationship that must be balanced when it comes to security. Bitcoin exists largely in response to the way governments conduct themselves with respect to issues of money. For Bitcoin to correctly orient its security architecture, the probable threats against it must be correctly understood. Those threats are are political in nature. 
If Bitcoin evolves around imagined, highly improbable attacks, it will likely end up crippling itself, while competitor crypto currencies end up being significantly less expensive and more widely used. The big problem for Bitcoin in that scenario is that Bitcoin's security depends on having lots of energy burned to secure it. 
Basically, if Bitcoin isn't big, it isn't safe.

I never switched. I've always had my node coded to accept 32-MB blocks. It was just some people who choose to set their clients to reject blocks greater than 1-MB. Just because some people choose to code different rules into their clients doesn't mean the definition of Bitcoin changed. If you think about it, there is really no proof that a majority of anybody, nodes, miners, etc., have a 1-MB limit in their code. I challenge any one to cite a Sybil-resistant metric to counter that claim.
But, even if a large majority of people did have such a limit in their code, it wouldn't even change the point: there was never consensus on the 1-MB limit, just some people doing something to their code.
It's a little bit crazy to suggest Bitcoin be bound by a few people deciding to go their own way, even if it was something Satoshi original added (added after the fact is the distinction).
I'll rephrase it again. Some people start enforcing a limit on their own accord. For a while, the network happens to operate inside that limit. Later the network moves outside of that limit. Basically, some people forked themselves off, by their own choosing.
In no case has consensus be violated, since it wasn't their to begin with.

It should be possible to prevent a certain soft-fork, or set of soft-forks, by implementing a 'defensive' soft-fork first.  has likened the network rules to a block of marble, and we can carve out the marble with soft-forks.  Only hard-forks can add marble back in to where it has been carved out.
There should be plenty of soft-forks that are mutually exclusive with each other, and once one is implemented, the only way to 'undo' it and implement a mutually exclusive rule would be with a hard-fork.

That's strongly worded, yet still vague claim. We all know that full-node has primarily decreased because people have plenty of more convenient options in the form of lite- and spv-wallets. People happily use those wallets because in daily practice -so far at least- they are functionally equivalent to a full node. If the day comes when lite wallets give people less financial freedom, or double-spends and fraud are a major problem, and *if* under such a situation running a full-node would solve those problems, you will then no doubt see the number of full nodes drastically increase. The important part is that people be *able* to run a full node if they need to (having access to a full node that they trust is all that really matters). In that sense, it is actually a sign of Bitcoin's health that the node count is low.


Well, that could happen here too. Decentralized mining, however, can't protect us either, since we don't have it anymore.


Again, people will need to use the best tools to fight censorship if they are being censored, or perhaps even in solidarity with others who are (anonymity set). The current state of affairs is that a light-wallets aren't having any problems at all with users being censored. If a full node offered functional benefit in every day use -such as defeating censorship- people would be using them.  


Setting aside my above points about that *lack of need* for full nodes, I agree that more resource intensive nodes are less appealing to run. However, at best that argument can explain only why a smaller *percentage* of users would run a full node. Growing the overall user base - which bigger blocks *facilitate* - will more than counter the slightly smaller percentage of users that will run full nodes due to their cost.

How do you know someone else will find something desirable, and how do you know their preferences will never change?


First of all, Bitcoin ≠ Bitcoin security, so you are arguing against a statement that I did not make.  Second, notwithstanding that face the argument you are making does not address my initial post, it is still incorrect.  Bitcoin security has technical and non-technical aspects to it.  Unless you consider you consider honesty a technical matter?  Bitcoins fundamental security assumption is that a majority of hashpower is honest.  If you're telling me that human honesty is a purely technical matter, than your statement comes closer to being true.

That would be the algorithm then. 
Currently, the hash of a block already does depend on the previous hash.
If it is unguided, you would have to accept that it could produce and algorithm that was unsolvable. If the process was more constrained, I think you would find that it would basically be like what we have now.
And, it's absolutely critical that the PoW function be well understood and have no shortcuts or weaknesses, criteria which an experimental algo is unlikely to meet.

It absolutely is. You have provided no reasons to support your assertion.

The 1 MB blocksize limit was a soft-fork, and can be considered a "new rule". Making blocks larger than 1 MB isn't violating the original consensus rules. It doesn't take full consensus to tighten the rules, but the risk for those who go along with tightened rules is that others may choose to ignore those tightened rules. In that context, I think it is clear that those running the tightened rules would have left the original chain, and not vice versa.

Well, a majority of miners can organize to enforce certain things. Such a grouping is often referred to - sometimes derisively - as a cartel.
I think it would worthwhile if miners organized to divert some of the mining proceeds into a development fund. Of course there is a free rider problem, that other miners may choose to not contribute. This could be avoided though the action of a majority cartel - miners could orphan any blocks that didn't contribute to the reward.
The reward could be tiny, something on the order of 0.1% to 0.4%. Each block would be required to send funds to address under control of a DAO like system. There could be PoS votes to chose which development teams and proposals were awarded the funding. There is no reason why there couldn't be partial funding of teams.
Miners could give themselves a percentage of the vote - say 50% miner vote, and 50% PoS vote.

I disagree about them reaching this 'problem' at the same stage as Bitcoin. No one knows the answer to how much decentralization is enough. We do know that a certain type of decentralization is expensive and inefficient. Bitcoin has made a guess that "x-much" is necessary, and we will pay highly for it, since we think that people will value it. Other coins have come along and effectively said "we think Bitcoin is overpaying for decentralization, to an unnecessary extent. Here, use our coin, is cheaper since we aren't paying as much for decentralization, or are using less expensive techniques (PoS). We haven't had a problem yet, and we don't think we will."
It's kind like 'Preppers', or 'doomsdayers', in the bunker with guns and canned food for a catastrophe that is unlikely to come, and that their prepping may not even help them survive. Sometimes that seems to me what Bitcoin's stance is. Meanwhile, others who have realized the bunker might not be nessacery, and are out and about getting things done.

Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized, and yet allow group of people to reach consensus about the state of transactions, balances, and even more generally, a time-stamped version of history. A key ingredient in Satoshi's recipe for success was using hash-power and cleaver incentives to encourage people to work together AND to allow participants to have faith they were seeing the correct chain, as least insofar as a high-work chain is expensive to produce. The one-cpu-one-vote concept has, today, given way to a small handful of massive data-centers filled with specialized hardware. In this sense, Bitcoin's PoW is no longer technologically decentralized, especially not with respect to state-actors wishing to impose upon the network: If they wanted to, they could, and it wouldn't even cost them very much.
To understand then, why Bitcoin today continues to function more-or-less as expected, and essentially unimpeded, even though the networks hashing power is highly centralized, one has to look beyond the technological layer, and into the social, economic, and political layers where Bitcoin also exists. Here the answers are also complex, but are mostly a combination of its novelty, the jurisdictional coordination required to take any enforcement actions, its dual-use nature, the difficulty in defining it, potential first amendment defenses, and finally that fact that it's a new, shiny technology that is in alignment with free-market principles that some governments, at least partly, embrace.
The hashing is still providing a service, but that no longer includes decentralization. Realizing that fact is a prerequisite to understanding the mechanism by which larger blocks help decentralization, which is chiefly that they allow more people to participate directly on network and enjoy Bitcoin's advantages. The more people who use it, the more economically important it becomes, and the more political support it will have from the 'the people'. 
Bitcoins is also in a grow-or-die state. The human effort and other costs put into Bitcoin every day only make sense, in aggregate, if one believes the system will grow in use and value. At some scale, the system will become fully worth-while in its own right, paying it's own way even without any expectations of growth. Bitcoin can only be decentralized if it continues to exist, and any decentralization will only be meaningful if Bitcoin remains relevant in a social-economic context, and not just as a novelty.
It's true that larger blocks are not the only way to grow the system. Layer-2 systems will be critical in Bitcoin's story for many reasons, including the need to have the main chain be manageable. The main chain will never be able to accommodate the almost infinite demand for transactions or tamper-proof, distributed storage. 
Bitcoin's current lack of hash-power distribution and the vulnerabilities associated with that fact means Bitcoin's censorship resistant qualities are being derived from elsewhere. Currently the best way to ensure that Bitcoin remains resistant to some censorship, or the total censorship of an attack or shutdown, is to make sure the user base keep growing. Full blocks, long confirmation times, and high fees are currently the biggest impediment to continued growth in the user base. As larger blocks will help to alleviate this critical issue, they are a key part of keeping bitcoin decentralized.

I wasn't clear in my response though, when I said Bitcoin needed to be big, I was thinking of PoW, and how it is quantitative, rather than qualitative, security. Bitcoins security model rests on the assumption that it has "lots" of hashing behind it. If the hash rate fell to 1% of what is was today, or 99x as much SHA256 hash power were directed at another coin, Bitcoin would be very easy to attack.
You made a fair point though, about political safety resulting (or not!) from size. It's good to keep that in mind, although I tend to be of the opinion that the more widely used it is, the more politically unpalatable it will be to to try to outlaw it.

I am continually amazed at various arguments people have against using the power of cryptographically assured voting techniques, i.e. coin-weighted votes. Usually it boils down to something like "democracy is mob-rule". But then the same people argue that "miners shouldn't be in control", and defer to some vague "economic majority" concept, without specifying a metric by which that can be measured or assessed.
Perhaps it's too soon to use PoS for confirming transactions, but it most certainly can be used to as a sybil-proof meta communication tool, to let the miners and any interested party know what the economic, voting majority is thinking.

Well stated, go1111111.
It's clear to me that even if it was only 85% of users and hashpower switched over to 2MB blocks, that would effectively be what Bitcoin became. If the 15% sticking with 1MB insisted on calling their chain "Bitcoin", I don't think that's a fight I'd bother picking. It's only fair that the would have some consolation prize, considering that the price would tank.

Agreed.  Crypto currencies in some form will continue to exist, but purely PoW coins will always be vulnerable, as you have pointed out.

This is a pretty typical point of confusion in the bitcoin community, so it's understandable that you are confused, not with what consensus means, but where in the bitcoin system it is applicable.
If 55% of nodes and hashpower decide to modify their code and run something different than before, there is consensus among that group, provided they were all operating under their own free will and volition.  And their software will all work together to reach consensus on a certain blockchain.  
So let's say the other 45% want to keep running the original code?  Well they are free to do so as well, and the software they run will work to find consensus with other like-minded code bases and they will produce their own blockchain.
The beauty is that everyone is free to run the software they choose, and to mine on the chain that they want.  It's all free choice.
Now I understand that some people may find it upsetting that others may choose to not value their coins... and that is everyone's right to do so.  If I make a hard-fork that ignores your 'coins', and the whole world knowingly adopts it, did we steal from you?  I think not.  You still have the private key... the world would just be choosing to not value something you have, which is their right.  Fungibility would help to alleviate that specific risk, but the principle remains. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:09:12
The worst reasonably likely scenario is that Bitcoin's hash power falls precipitously, and the network begins to suffer regular 51% attacks until it is no longer functional, and the chain and the coin become essentially abandon.
Why would that happen?  Bitcoin's security model depends on the continued real-time input of massive amounts of electrical energy to secure the system.  It's a wasteful model in a certain sense, but there is beauty to it as well.  But for mining to anything but extremely wasteful in a practical sense, there needs to be many users.  There needs to be an economy of scale.
Currently, the amount of resources invested in mining only make sense in terms of speculation about what Bitcoin could become.  If a crystal ball revealed that Bitcoin would never have more users than it does today, it would die a hasty death.
A Proof-of-Stake system could probably function just fine with 100,000 users, but PoW?  No way.  Speculation of growth is the only think keeping the system running.  (I know PoS has problems, I'm not saying it is superior)
I hold coin and am bullish on Bitcoin becoming widely adopted.

Exactly, and that was a great read, Jameson.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:16:30


Perhaps, but that has nothing to do with what I wrote. It is a fact that mining is not decentralized today, and it is a fact that Bitcoin is still functioning unimpeded by regulation at the protocol / miner level. Therefore it follows that it cannot be the decentralization of mining that is protecting Bitcoin.


That's a false comparison. Paypal is unambiguously a financial services company that no one ever thought or believed would not be subject to existing regulations. Bitcoin has a completely different structure. It will take new legislation, rule makings, and court cases before Bitcoin could even possibly have regulations that resemble PayPal, and even then, the regulations for Bitcoin will clearly be different. Are the rules for VoIP the same as POTS? Are Uber's rules that same as for taxis? Email the same as snail-mail? YouTube the same as broadcast TV? No. In every instance the newcomer has a lower regulatory burden.
More to the point: since decentralized mining does not currently exist, it's plain delusional to pin hopes on it for warding off regulations. It's possible that popularity and economic utility will not be enough to keep Bitcoin unregulated either, but they certainly represent a better chance than hoping decentralized mining will keep them at bay, because it just isn't.

That's the problem with the argument that a hard fork is somehow morally different than a sof tfork. I am leaning towards the only useful difference in understanding between the two being how nodes react in the short term to a change.
Lets say a series of soft forks reduce the block size down to 1 KB, and Bitcoin becomes totally useless. Some people are actually arguing that pushing out a 500 KB would constitute a hard fork, that it wouldn't be the true Bitcoin, that it needed 100% consensus, that it would be reckless, etc.
The fact is the only people form whom the fork feels 'hard' are those who freely choose to enforce the tighter rules. They are absolutely free to enforce whatever tightness of rules they want, but it's a specious argument to suggest that somehow everyone must abide by those rules, and that if they don't, they are creating an 'alt-coin'.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:15:30
Yes, if there is true compromise, which could come at any moment, BTC could easily surge to new heights, especially if that compromise was BU + SegWit, or  4MB-8MB-16MB + SegWit. But if not, a nasty fork or PoW switch or something like could could possibly mean the end of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-07 13:56:45
Exactly Bruce. Exactly. if the 'blocksize increase' in SegWit is a compromise, that implies that Core's first preference is to keep the limit at 1MB, even with SegWit activated. In that case, SegWit would offer no relief from the current fee situation, other than by enabling lightning and other layer-2 solutions (which are important in the long term... I am an ardent lightning supporter!).
People keep parroting the word "compromise" to suggest the SegWit package that is being offered is reasonable, that it is some sort of middle ground. It may in fact be reasonable, but to accurately use the word 'compromise', one would have to know what Core's preferred position is.

The threat model is of a political nature, and people in this community have widely divergent views of what the treats against Bitcoin are.  While how to handle a particular threat may be a largely technical issue, calculating  the cost/benefit ratios cannot of any security metric cannot be accomplished with critical politically-based assumptions.  The idea that one has to be an expert in C++ to have a worthy viewpoint is silly, and frankly, insulting.

First, they are both open-source software projects with maintainers who are the gate keepers and in control of what gets merged.

Please consider the implications of what you are suggesting when you say "current software build". There is no controlling build.
The way the term 'hard fork' has been being used doesn't mean a new or untested feature. Let's look again at the example I gave in my previous post. If there was a 'soft fork' to limit the block size to 1 KB, and after that people started mining 1 MB blocks again... that would be a 'hard fork' according to definition commonly used. But it should be clear that doesn't mean any new or untested features, just a return to before when some people started enforcing tighter rules.
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:33:34
It's not a linear equation. It may well be true that if you could control for every single other variable, larger blocks would increase the economic pressure for miners to co-locate. But in real-world bitcoin, there are many variables and complex dynamics at play.
Can you think of any reasons why larger blocks could help increase decentralization? How about then comparing those forces to the ones you think would cause centralization.
Electricity is already by far the most dominant variable in the mining equation, with labor costs and access to cheap asics not far behind. China can produce just about anything at a lower cost, including hashes.
It actually can be okay to do something in a certain situation, when things are already 'bad', that it wouldn't be okay to do in a good situation. It's like the opposite of the law of diminishing returns. Most behaviors and actions are context dependent, and are judged by what their effect actually is, and not what it would be in a different situation.
Consider playing loud music at night in a city, where people are trying to sleep. If the city was quiet, it would clearly be a problem, it would be THE reason why people couldn't sleep. But let's say the local sports team just won a championship, and the whole city is celebrating all night long. It's already loud, with music, gunfire, police sirens, crowds, etc.. The impact of playing your own music loudly, on that night, is diminished. Yes, it can be argued that it is 'making it worse', but the net effect on anyone's ability to sleep is next to nothing. The enjoyment gained by playing the music, however, remains the same. 
The same benefit / less-of-a-negative-impact = a more better outcome.

If we an get to a point where all transactions live on the Lightning network, sure.
Demand for blockspace is unbounded. There do need to be fees. But Lightning as well depends on access to block space. 
Isn't it a systemic risk if there is wide spread cheating in Lighting all at the same time, and due to limited block space not all cheated participants are able seek the remedy / close the channels / enforce the fraud proof within the required number of blocks? Let's say fraud affects 1 Million channels, yet there is only enough room in blocks for 20,000 channels to prove the fraud before the time window closes, no matter the fees.
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:57:07
Fees pressure is a curve. Fees don't just fall of a cliff after 1-MB. There is lots of unmet demand from transactions that currently would only be willing to pay less than the minimum required fee. The expected result of a 20% larger block would be small to medium reduction in the required fees.

The 29 BTC are in my account and in the clear.  The reason I had claimed USD was because I had had ~$21,000 USD and 0 BTC in the account in the days and weeks leading up to the collapse.  After the troubles started, I bought BTC at various prices and tried to withdraw.  Of course the withdrawals didn't work.  If someone had asked me "what's in you account?" at the end, I would have said $1.02 and 28.95 BTC.  If someone had asked me "what would make you whole again?"  I would have said $21,000.  That's why I claimed it, it was what I hoped to recover.  I thought the chance of them approving the USD total was fairly small, but I'm honestly shocked they didn't convert the claim to BTC.  If I had claimed $1 Billion and 1 Billion BTC I would have been better off.  The Trustee would have just reduced the claim to the amount in my account, as he did for other some other outrageous claims.

They have had many security issues over the years.  If you are new, try a phone wallet, using either Breadwallet for iOS or Myceilium for Android.  Follow the backup procedures carefully.  I consider either one secure for up to about $100 of value.  If you want to store more, you have some research to do!  Something like Coinbase or Circle should be fine for a few hundred dollars worth of crypto storage, although both involve placing explicit trust in third parties.

It's not much different than mining pools having a bigger vote due to hash power pointed their way. But it's certainly good to keep in mind, and to some extent could diminish the quality of the results, but that doesn't mean the results wouldn't still be meaningful. The votes wouldn't be binding in any sort of way. If Coinbase holds 1,000,000 BTC, that means vast numbers of users trust them and have granted them lots of control. IMHO, a responsible custodian would poll it's users and then vote proportionally. So, your point is important to keep in mind, but a PoS vote would still be valuable.
On the complexity, I thought there were other things too. If the location of the witness merkle root is the only issue, perhaps that isn't so bad.

Why does the percentage of listening nodes have any bearing on this? We all do better to stick with indicators that are anchored in cryptographic proof, which could be proof or work or proof of stake. 
Proof of IP address is NOT a relevant metric in the way you are using it. It CAN still be useful to consider absolute numbers of nodes / IP address, but only when keeping in mind that absolute numbers can be subject to false positives - and worse, false positives that can be manipulated. Node counts do not suffer from false negatives though... if there are zero nodes that implement a particular feature than it is safe to assume that there is no support for it. 
Keeping these facts in mind, we can not rule out support for either SegWit or Unlimited / Classic. That doesn't mean there is support for either one... in both cases all instances could just be empty manipulation. Again, the only conclusion that is safe to draw from the current node counts is THAT WE CANNOT RULE OUT EITHER IMPLEMENTATION BASED ON NODE COUNTS!

"The moment they exert control of the chain and its funds they are..."
The only problem with what you are describing is the 'they' is not a definable group.  Vitalik can't force a change, he can only code one up and lobby for it's adoptance.  What would the regulators do?  Send out letters to all nodes and miners and users that they must switch systems, so as to effect their order?  In that respect I see a fork as safe - it jest reflects the will of the community, a change no one can force.

I agree with what you have written and appreciate the input.  I found another route which is will help me for 10% if I get a payout, so I have nothing to loose by trying.  I totally understand what you are saying about someone else calming the Gox dollars I had traded away.  The fact is there would have been many approaches to unwinding Gox, and many different opinions on what is fair.  The Trustee, to my knowledge, never indicated which approach they were going to use.  It seems like they have chosen what is perhaps the simplest method of just going by whatever people's Gox balances were at closing.  They could have used some sort of time-weighted approach as well.  For instance, someone who wired $10,000 to Gox in the final week could have been deemed eligible to recieve most of their money back, while someone who had parked 100 BTC their back in 2011 might have lost almost all of it.  Anyway, they didn't do that.
As far as potential bad-faith claims, what I see as ironic is that it looks like people who over-claimed got their requests reduced to whatever the Trustee decided their accounts actually had, and thus were made whole, whereas if someone under-claimed, or claimed the wrong asset, as in my case, the Trustee didn't adjust up, or "sideways".

Less security, as least under the current conditions. It is hard to have more security since Lightning builds on top of Bitcoin. A weakness in Bitcoin would also mean Lightning is not as secure, but the reverse is not true.
Lightning also has an active security model, where you or a delegate must watch the chain and take action to defend against certain attacks with a specific time period. With Bitcoin, properly secured private keys require no persistent efforts.
There is also a unresolved systemic risk with Lightning, that a massive fraud / hack could result in the inability of users to have their fraud proofs included on chain before the dispute period ended.
That being said, I am a big fan of lightning. It can offer us many great things, such as instant confirmation transactions. I am looking forward to keeping some spending money in an open channel, similar to the amount I currently keep on the wallet in my phone.
Unfortunately on of my favorite things I do with my phone wallet won't work with lighting: sending $1 worth of BTC to a new user. Lightning only works among people who are already BTC users and have a channel open themselves. Give casual demonstration transactions will likely remain cost-prohibitive until we hard-fork to larger block sizes.

A hard fork only needs 51% of mining power.
Of course you would be hard-pressed to find miners who would want to for with 51%... it would be unstable, since the hash power could swing back and forth across the 'line'.

I suspect that the developers intent on holding Bitcoin back from it's potential are heavily invested in alt-coins. Charlie Lee, for example, is using his influence to keep Bitcoin fees high, and actively suggesting that people use Litecoin as a faster, cheaper alternative.
@_date: 2017-01-20 23:32:21
Agreed. Personally, I'm content to see it adopted if it gets the needed support... there are clear benefits. But I also understand (and share!) concerns about governance and overall direction and vision for the project. If SegWit does not get the required support as is, I think the next best chance of finding super-majority support would be a modified SegWit that when activates, also sets us on a course for a hard-fork that increases the base block size, perhaps just to 2 or 4MB, a hard fork that would itself only activate 12 or 18 months in the future.
*edit - The idea above is a softfork that 'locks in' a future hard fork. I think that's possible.
I see there being a trust gap that can be bridged with a package deal. The current 'roadmap' is SegWit now, hard fork later, but at the same time, that is just a 'roadmap', and we all know that 'no one speaks for Core', that Core itself is decentralized and no has final say over the process. So I don't think it's really reasonable for someone to support SegWit contingent on the fact the there will be a hard fork later, as there is no one authorized to make that pledge for either Bitcoin as a whole, or even for Core as project.
SegWit has 24% of hashpower and Bitcoin Unlimited has 17%, with the rest undeclared. If consensus or mutually acceptable compromise cannot be attained, at some point it would be best if the networked forked so each camp can move in their desired directions. I'd be happy to hold coins on both.
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:57:34
That's a false pretense... it's not even possible for anyone to "dictate" the development of bitcoin, as it is open source.
As a practical matter though, some people are in control of the existing 'power centers', such as the github repository, and certain forums, domain names, etc. There is a lot of soft-power in that control. It's not like Bitcoin has an election of who runs these things.
It is what it is, but its interesting to think how much of the influence of the Core team is due to their vision, how much is due to their reputation, and how much is due to their control of the brand, via inheritance of Satoshi's project.
Anyone in control of the repo has built-in advantage in the marketplace of ideas.
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:06:02
This is a key point to understand if one is to understand the market dynamics today and into the future. People often say the previous spike to over $1,000 was a fluke, driven by fraud a Mt. Gox, which may be true. But still, it was entirely possible to liquidate coins - and liquidate thousands of coins - for $1,000 USD a piece in a safe and reliable manner. Many early adopters did sell significant amounts at that time, but certainly there are many who still retained coins numbering over a thousand. If they didn't sell before or at at the last peak, and they weren't forced to sell over the long bear market, it's hard to imagine they would sell now, or at any higher price. Sure, they might cash out 10% to diversify, or to do some trading if they sense the top of a bubble with hopes of buying back more later. But cashing out and leaving Bitcoin altogether? Hard to see.
So the big dumps that people worry might come along and push down the price... they probably will not happen. The people who have been buying since the end of 2013 either don't own significant sums of coins, or they have enough money play the long game, which everyone knows is many times higher than the current price. Tim Draper wasn't waiting for the $1,000 BTC to cash out.

It's not about me or you. It's about enough people.
If only all we had to do was to make running nodes cheap.... But Bitcoin is a complex system, and many variables need to be balanced.
If all that mattered was cheap nodes, a blocksize of 10kb would be much better, and we could achieve that today with a soft-fork. All it would take would be a majority of miners to agree, and agree to orphan any block that was greater than 10kb.

Those are all good points as well.  My responses:
1) I have often worried about the devs' safety myself at times... there are lots of crazies out in this world. I think they could future distance themselves from the appearance of control over the protocol by, in the case of a contentious issue, provide more options for voting. That could mean two or more options in the case of a softfork, rather than just "activate or not", and there is always the possibility of conducting PoS votes to cryptographically gauge the sentiment of the community (although I have heard plenty of pushback against that concept when I've broached it before).
2) Agreed. It would be great to have a more organized process for assesing the "economic majorities" opinion. As I mentioned, I think PoS voting has some merit. Then there are the companies: the wallet devs, the exchanges, the payment processors etc. Perhaps a more organized way to gauge their sentiment would be beneficial as well.
3) Hard forks are riskier in the short term. I think there is concern that SegWit is more technically complex than it needs to be so that it can be implemented as a soft fork, where it could be simpler as a hard fork. I too don't blame the devs for being cautious, for not wanting big problems on their watch, but isn't this the 'technical debt' concept; if the system becomes more complex and less well-understood, there are more likely to be issues farther down the road. I'll just tack on an additional centralization concern I have right here: the system eventually becomes so complex that very very very few people understand it. That itself is a risk :)
I don't think the effective blocksize increase and the blockweight change are the only contentious parts. SegWit being a softfork is itself contentious, but I don't know of anyone who doesn't want to address malleability, the question is just how. I thought there was widespread agreement that a hard-fork would be in Bitcoin's future at somepoint? I don't think BU or classic will gain a majority either. I also think that 99% of specialists is an exaggeration. It is true that 99% of people who agree agree, but there are plenty of good minds out there who don't see SegWit as the best path forward, or, at least would have preferred not to have bitcoin in the position it finds itself in now. It's not just technical, but political as well, and when it comes to politics, rational people can disagree.

It's incredibly meaningful to have larger base blocks. We need layer-2, and larger blocks. Between lightning and 32-MB blocks (lets say three years from now), Bitcoin can grow to a size and value where it's direction will be shaped by yet unknown forces.

Interesting, I only just realized pruned nodes didn't share the blocks they do have because I had a personal use case, and it wasn't working.
I think it would be quite helpful in diffusing load. If a pruned node keeps 5GB of blocks on hand, that is the most recent month. Many full nodes are going to be offline for some amount of time, perhaps a few days or a few weeks, and then try to sync. Pruned nodes that served blocks could help in this very common situation.

That would depend on how deeply Bitcoin is broken. If Bitcoin fails to adapt to changing circumstances appropriately, perhaps because of a stalemate about how best to make those adaptations, it's entirely possible that a new coin takes the mantle of being no. 1.

A hard fork to adjust or 'correct' the emergency difficulty adjustment won't necessarily cause the price to 'crash' or even go down.

The Bitcoin Cash community doesn't have a "no-contentious hardfork" complex, which actually lessens the contention around forks. 
I haven't devoted much thinking recently to the game theory of mining difficulty, but I'd suspect that a well constructed fork designed to even-out some of the mining variations would be adopted without much issue.
Absolutist will argue that you need total consensus to have a hard fork be non-contentious. In political reality, 80-90% represents overwhelming support and should be enough to adopt almost any measure without an issue.

As for the coin vote, you are citing coin concentration as a problem without defining why. What is your goal here? How or what do you want to be the organizing principal?
Imagine that we had an iron-clad identity system, one-to-one with physical humans. Would you prefer a vote using that system? Who's input do you want?
You cited a small percentage of as the basis for not wanting a coin-weighted vote. 50% of all BTC is held by as few as (about) 1,200 addresses. That is far less centralized than mining. If 50% of the hash power was distributed among 1,200 different miners we should all be happy.
At the end of the day, Bitcoin is about people. Some one, or some group will be in control. Talk of full consensus is nonsense, it's just a tactic. The two truths to Bitcoin are 1) as individuals we are sovereigns, you can run whatever code you choose 2) Mining as currently implemented is about a majority of hash not power, not a consensus.
So I ask again - who are you trying to give input to if not people who hold coins?

Miners are very important economic nodes themselves. They are also service providers / producers. They won't get very far if they make moves that go counter to the wishes of the user base, but it is also their right to gauge for themselves the level of support they think they have.

Most Bitcoin Cash supporters understand there need to be fees as well. Let's suppose that 8MB blocks become full at the "1$" fee level for a typical tx. That would be $16,000 worth of fees per block, and would mean that Bitcoin Cash had become a raging success, and probably more economically significant than regular Bitcoin is currently.
I would assume several things at that point:
1) You would see huge amount of developer interest in Bitcoin Cash.
2) Bitcoin Cash would pursue level-2 solutions
3) Bitcoin Cash would pursue level-1 optimizations
4) Bitcoin Cash would probably raise the block size
As to where raising the block size ends, that would depend on the community. Currently my standard is that I be able to run a node at home, and thus far I have been able to do that on old hardware. Syncing the chain takes two days on a 4-year old laptop. I wouldn't care if it took a week or two to sync. And you know how people said that 'fee pressure' was necessary to incentivize development of layer-2 solutions ? I think 'sync pressure' is needed to incentivize other solutions there. If enough varied and trusted sources tell you that a certain chain state is valid, the needed to validate everything is almost eliminated. But for the truly concerned, a home audit of the chain should remain within reach.
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:58:24

Yes, if there if there is less transaction demand than capacity, it's expected that fees would be very low. But transactional demand would have grown exponentially (and was looking that way) until fee pressure started to eliminate use cases. Transactional demand probably would be in several-MB range if fees were just a few cents or lower for a standard tx. We will see soon enough. I highly doubt that fees will fall very much, and in any case they will be as high as they are now within a few months. Of course if transactional demand permanently switches over to other chains (as has been happening), that could be a mitigating factor.

Yes, transactions shouldn't be free, and there is almost infinite demand for them.
For low-value use cases, it's a question of when they get priced out. It's good that SatoshiDice isn't doing that anymore, and it i's also good the service existed at one point in time. It was an important catalyst in Bitcoin's early growth. Currently, we have already priced out low-cost demonstrations for new users. Lightning isn't yet live, and but all guesses it will take some time before it's in widespread use. We have also price out low / medium cost purchases, again, too soon. Paying between $5 and $50 for computer services over the internet is a real and currently awesome application for Bitcoin, and yet paying a few bucks for a transaction is totally lame. As a customer, I actually prefer if they accept ethereum.
Yes, eventually fees will rise to current levels even with the block sizes you mentioned. But demand for $1 fees is not infinite. At *some* block size the demand at that price point would be less than the supply. And the same can be said for any arbitrary fee level.
Absolute block size does matter. Kicking the can down the road has real benefits. Bigger blocks allow for more economic activity.
@_date: 2016-11-16 22:14:20
For many it has value in the trait that one can almost perfectly hide the fact they control some amount of bitcoins, and at the least plausible deniability is quite easy to attain. Coupled with the fact there is no legal mechanism to freeze or confiscate accounts, and that a holder's coins can be controlled from any computer or smartphone in the world... these are powerful concepts.  The only practical equivalence I can think of is burying gold in secret locations, which admittedly has some benefits that bitcoin does not, but then again, bitcoin has benefits which the burying of the gold lacks as well.
Even if you personally feel quite comfortable and confident in the security of your assets, I think you must recognize that the features I just described are and will be found attractive by many tens or even hundreds of millions of people around the world.  That desirability will lead to adoption, which considering the finite supply of bitcoin, will lead to a higher price, which as an investor, I'm sure you would value :)

Settlement transaction aside, I would call Changetip's transactions Bitcoin-denominated IOU's, or something.

About your second reason, I think most would agree that Bitcoin's long term security model is an open question. How is it paid for? How much proof of work is 'enough'? Will SHA256 remain secure? Will hashing "remain" decentralized?
Collecting some amount of fees for usage is also necessary, to prevent spam (which I think can only be defined by one's willingness to pay nothing, or almost nothing, for). And why not have those fees go towards security? Yes, it makes sense, and most would agree.
But will those fees be sufficient? And who is deciding how to maximize those fees? What is making people uncomfortable right now is the appearance of a central committee that is attempting to strike the correct  economic balance. Even if the larger community should trust that Core has Bitcoin's best interests at heart (what are Bitcoin's interests, anyway?), there is the question of economic expertise. Does Core posses it? We know their Crypto and C++ credentials, but that doesn't mean anything when it comes to economic theory. Some of you guys seem to have pretty decent economic reasoning, but others can seem a little bit kooky on the matter.
What would help? Find as many ways to decouple the economic decisions from the technical ones. Whenever possible, attempt to give the community a chance for meaningful feedback. Of course Reddit and Bitcoin talk can be censored. Perhaps an on-chain, coin weighted vote could be held on certain matters.  For other choices, give the miners and opportunity to vote among several options with their hashpower. They yay/nay, up-or-down on big, substantial, and somewhat controversial packages of changes (such as SegWit) is far from ideal.
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:56:15
What you describe - ceasing to interact with businesses that conduct fraud - of course makes sense. But I don't think it at all address the concern of the long con, where after years of good and honest performance, a business without warning 'defaults' on hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars worth of channels in one fell swoop, with the money spread out over enough channels that they can't all close at once. There would be a 'run on the chain', not any different than a run on the banks, with not enough capacity to make everyone whole. There is nothing wrong with lightning... I'm a huge fan, but I haven't yet come across the solution to what I just described. It's insidious because lighting is designed to be trustless and avoid custodial risk, and it is for any individual channel, but given enough open channels... it's like there aren't enough lifeboats. Not that this problem would be solved by having 8MB blocks...

High speed arbitraging is essential. It has the effect of pooling liquidity from exchanges scattered around the world.

Bitcoin is not Bitcoin because of SHA256 PoW and miners. It is Bitcoin because of the economic value and trust it's users place in it. If a large percentage (perpahps 30%, perhaps 70%) of it's users loose trust in it, they could support a fork, with the SHA256 miners behind them, or by using a different PoW if they didn't have the Bitcoin miners support. That trust could be lost do to ill conceived 'meddling' as you fear, or it could be due to Bitcoin's failure to adapt as the world changes around it. You acknowledge at least one scenario - quantum wreaking havoc - and leave room open for other 'wild stuff'. The thing is, where that interface is, at what point does Bitcoin become compromised by 'wild stuff' or other unpredictable things, is open to interpretation of the user base.
As for fundamentally 'disagreeing with consensus', I'm not really sure what you mean by that, but in the end, people will find ways to collaborate and work with each other to get the results they want. In fact, Bitcoin is designed as a majority system. Satoshi writes "The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision
making." I've read many people's descriptions of what they want Bitcoin to be, hoping to turn it into almost a 'law of nature' or something, something beyond human control. Most people want a financial system that is fair, transparent (in some senses), and accountable to it's users.




There doesn't need to be consensus, only a large enough group to making going their own way worthwhile.
Miners work for the users.
Of course I'm not sure that Bitcoin will split into two, but still think that it will. Again, you are arguing as if SHA256 is the only way forward, which it's not, and also that it's inconceivable that a majority of economic power would want a shift, which you just can't know.
@_date: 2016-12-04 02:13:26
Fair enough. I am suggesting that people consider wider adoption and popularity as a security metric. In considering risks to the network, one does not need to take in only 'how bad would it be if it happened' (such as a government-sponsored attack), but also 'how likely is it to occur'.
Considering that scale is a critical component of Bitcoin's security assumptions (right there beside economically-rational actors), I am an advocate of larger blocks, to make room for more users and transactions.
SegWit is important... the Lightning Network is critical to bitcoin's future. And SegWit also will provide some direct relief of fee pressure and transaction backlog via it's effective blocksize increase.  But I also think it was a mistake to package the blocksize relief in with the other changes. I think Bitcoin would be in a stronger position right now with 4-MB blocks, which could have been implemented with a hard fork. The best outcome would have been if such a hard fork had been coded a couple of years ago, when this debate was heating up. It could have been activated, with a go-live date 12 to 18 months in the future.
What do I think would be the best thing right now? For Bitcoin Core to throw their weight behind a specific increase in the block size (say 4-MB, with SegWit on top of that), with a commitment to merge it into core within a one-month of SegWit's activation.
I think that would get the larger community and miners to come together, if not forever, at least temporarily. And decrease in  security due to larger blocks would be more than offset by growing the user base, and the increased security that is a natural offshoot of a larger, content community.
@_date: 2016-11-24 20:47:10
Yes.  And if blocks were 8MB and full, $0.32 per tx would have the same effect.  And if blocks were 100KB, it would take $25 per transaction.
Another question though, unanswered as far as I can tell, is how much hashing power is needed to achieve the ends the community seeks?

These is still a simple attack vector - bitaddress.org could only pretend to be deriving the address from the private key you provided, when in fact it is giving you an address that is associated with a different private key, controlled by someone other than you.

Illogical FOMO is a very important part of Bitcoins overall trajectory. When the price moons, which we can consider irrational, it is in the headlines. It captures the attention of the average Joe, the average bankster, the average Google engineer etc.. Companies get FOMO too, and set up exploratory groups. Then the price comes tumbling down, and the headlines go away, and some of the people who paid attention go back to ignoring it. 
But not all of them. Some of them become believers, and go on to contribute to Bitcoin Core, and start Bitcoin businesses, and successfully lobby their companies to get involved.

What? You've said this many times before, but it's not true. A hardfork can be any subset of nodes that choose to go a different way.  Any subset. Could be just 5%. To be economically viable, and to be secure with the same PoW, it would be better to have 70%+ of the economy and miners support the hardfork, and the more the better. But 100%? That just doesn't even mean anything.

You are right the confirmations will never be instant, and for rapid Txs, Lightning will be key.
However, moving to 5 minute blocks would cut waiting times in half across the distribution.  What problem would it solve? It would save people time in every instance where people have found themselves waiting for a confirmation or six.
Yes, it would increase the orphan rate and add slight mining centralization pressure.  I would argue that centralization pressures due to propagation delays are a minor factor, with hardware, labor and electricity costs (and associated regulations) as absolutely dominating the decisions about where to physically locate hash power

So the scenario you are describing is that someone has provably solvent note, but they don't yet have all of the signatures necessary to cash it in? To that I would say it totally, completely depends on who's signature is missing. It wouldn't be any worse than an unbacked IOU, but it might not be any better either. And solvent for how long? For ever?  What happens to the money if the last signature is never provided? Does the money remain stuck forever? I'm sure you've thought it all out, just asking rhetorically.

You are conflating quality and quantity. Every single person who bought or held BTC at 19k needed to arrive at their own, personal conclusion that one Bitcoin was worth that much. It would have never reached that number if a a substantial number of people did not hold that belief. What this kind of "manipulation" means is only that the number of people needing to hold such beliefs is lower than if the manipulation hadn't occurred for the price to hit the level that it did.

I assume you are not speaking of the immutability of the main chain, since that is 'immutable', or, at least mutations can be easily detected on account of PoW. You are speaking of the immutability of bitcoin's protocol, are you not, and the social-economic contract that is implicit in the protocol? It's certainly a feature that Bitcoin is opt-in, and one is able to fully audit the system at home, and that no one can force you to accept different rules. But as a social-economic 'contract', it's also a feature that the contract can change over time, should people desire it.


So long as the hard-fork is ill conceived, sure, it won't have widespread support. And for the moment, it seems there is less to be gained by a contentious hard-fork than the alternative. But honestly, at some point I see bitcoin forking into two different chains, both long-lived. And they may both survive for a long time, and both become economically useful for different purposes. I would happily keep coins on both sides. 


I doubt it. Some elements, yes, I would imagine they will be around for a long time, and perhaps forever, at least in terms of future backwards-compatibility respecting them. But plenty of other aspects are likely to change as it moves forwards, including in response to events, such as attack, or weakness found in SHA256 or ECDSA. Honestly, if I though that Bitcoin couldn't change to meet future needs, I wouldn't be nearly as certain in it's good change of success.

Proof of work paid for by transaction fees is plausible, if only for the fact that it is currently working, but as for it being 'a clear and sensible' path into the future is anything but certain. If the economic potential (investment aspect) of Bitcoin were wedded to that those two mechanisms, its odds working out favorably would be much diminished. To me, the absolute key in the wisdom of the investment is seeing that Bitcoin can evolve, if not to preserve it's ideals, than at least to safeguard it's holders assets. And it's totally possible it will fork in the future to do just that. It's hard for me to image a scenario where I wouldn't hold onto coins on both sides. The coin distribution, and the increasingly damped volatility, are themselves an asset of the ecosystem, and not an asset that one philosophy has a monopoly on. 


Yes Greg, you are free to do whatever you please, and I am thankful for all of your contributions to Bitcoin. But people don't ask for slave labor - they demand and force it. I promise you that you have not been close to enslavement.
As for a "coercive and incompatible change to the system's rules" - that is quite the rhetoric! The thing is, there are no "system's rules" here, just user and nodes and miners.  And if they agree, they agree. Everything is permissible. There is no moral pact that nodes will not update, or even leave behind other nodes. If there was a fork to make a certain address unspendable, that would not be stealing.
I think the best chance of keeping the network together for a while longer would be to have a better governance system, whereby the preferences of users would have a better receptacle than 'go else where if you don't like it' (not saying you said this, but the sentiment is out there).


It wouldn't be hard to implement blind voting, where votes are cast (and locked in ) over a certain block window, and once the window has closed, voters then reveal - cryptographically of course - the nature of the vote cast.


Bitcoin is a majority system. To the extent that we honor proof of work, we all acknowledge that limitation of hoping a majority of miners are honest.
And since what we are talking about here is a coin-weighted vote, absolutely should bitcoin answer to its economic majority. Coin holders are who are paying for the miners. Coin-weighted voting, if nothing else, is the best mechanism we have for the miners (and Core devs, if they cared) to have good signaling with there employers: the users. Miners should want to know. Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in dialog is to everyone's benefit, except for people who would rather see Bitcoin fall apart.

The last 7 years have been characterized by very large mining subsidies in the form of the block reward. If Bitcoin as a whole is looked at as a giant startup, it is still being funded and is not yet profitable overall. We are all hoping and thinking that day will come, but IMHO it has not arrived yet. The overall system is still operating at a loss. (And that includes many of the bitcoin-centric companies as well.)
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:53:41
The thing is, the really big money doesn't need bitcoin. They have vaults with gold, offshore shell companies, politicians in their pockets, and protectors running central banks.  The really big money sees bitcoin as a threat to their power, wealth, and the status quo. You know the saying "bitcoin is bank in your pocket"? That is an important equalizer for those of us who don't already own or control a 'regular' bank. To the exiting financial system, that the average joe can have their own bank is undesired competition.
It's critical that Bitcoin become widely used and politically popular... then it would become politically - and perhaps economically - untenable to try to attack it.
While it's possible bitcoin could withstand a coordinated effort by governments to shut it down, it also quite possibly would not. While it's good to have the network be as hardened as possible, we also really, really don't want to invite such a test. Cryptocurrency in some form is here to stay, that's a given, but bitcoin could be set back many years, or basically go extinct.
The giant mining centers could be taken over quite easily. Regulated exchanges could be shut down. A sustained 51%-attack would be very easy to pull off. Sure, Bitcoin could hard fork to a different PoW, or use trusted checkpoints and stuff for a while. It would be cat-and-mouse. It's wouldn't die altogether, but it's price could fall well into the double digits. The elite would want no part of that.
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:52:24


That is true. But just consider that holders don't have any costs to cover (costs in life perhaps, but no current costs related to the procurement of their coins). And it's not 1.5% just once, but for four years. After the next havening, the following 4 years will have 650,000 less BTC that will be mined. Adoption and awareness continue to grow as the general trend. New people learn about and want to acquire BTC every day. The tech keeps getting better. At some point the price will turn around, a bull market will set in, an FOMO will become a driving force, and in 2 years the supply of fresh coins to satisfy the newcomers will be just 50% of what it is today :)
We shall see. It's happened twice already, and both times were followed by the big bull markets.

Changetip transactions are bitcoin transactions?  Lightning, yes, as long as they are capable of being committed to the chain. But to suggest that a centralized, permissioned, and trusted database that  tracks balances and happens to put the word "bitcoin" beside them is either misinformed or disingenuous.


There are risks to Bitcoin other than the centralization of it's infrastructure... do you forget decentralization is a means, not and ends?


It also paves the way to other things, including a governance process that many here reject. Of course transaction malleability needs to be solved so that layer 2 solutions can be developed! But it is also clear that the Core devs are attempting to manage the economics of fee pressure, block subsidies, and security through this process, and currently the network has no good options for dealing with unsavory economics being packaged along with technical upgrades other than weigh the overall / cost benefit. It may end up being that SegWit gets rejected on that account.

Anyone has the option over paying a higher price than market. If there was this 'manipulation' then all it did was *remove the option to buy lower*. Anyone who purchased still needed to feel the price they paid was worth it.
I'd agree it what is described could have been part of why it hit $19k, I don't doubt that. But it was also a necessary condition for it to hit that high that millions of people believe a Bitcoin to be worth that much, and it stands to reason that the largest holders are savvy, and are basing that valuation on the risk/reward profile of Bitcoin as a paradigm changing technology with a giant first-mover advantage.

The people who bought bitcoins at $0.01 and literally forgot they had them, only to 'rediscover' them at $1,000's each, are truly lucky, and perhaps in that sense they are 'undeserving'.
However, for those who knowingly held, everyday holding is hardly different than selling and reinvesting. It is certainly an active choice. And the holders are what give Bitcoin value, dampen volatility, fund mining, and ultimately make this whole thing work.
The idea, in the end, is to deliver to the world, financial freedom. I think it is a very valuable function.

Yep. I'll take short term relief until the longer term solutions are ready. Larger blocks will be needed anyway, so they extra capacity will be helpful to layer 2 anyway.


Huh? Bitcoin Cash can confirm more transactions per block.


Sorry if you think a subreddit defines a project. I don't write off ideas because of who may support them. I look at the ideas themselves. Personally I don't think all transactions will happen on chain, and I don't think Bitcoin Cash will make the chain so large that I won't be able to validate it at home, on moderately priced hardware. And if there is an effort to make the chain too large for me to validate, I will join the large group of people that would fight in opposition to that measure.

XT will only fork with a super-majority of mining power.  We can confidently predict that if that threshold is reached, the remaining miners will switch over as well.  Further, the exchange rate of the unmined coin will likely collapse in short order, approaching zero.  Within a matter of hours, essentially 100% of the Bitcoin economy will be on the new fork.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:58:15
I agree. Layer 2 is critical. Hopefully most layer 2 solutions developed for Bitcoin can work on Bitcoin Cash as well. If Bitcoin Cash manages to hold a high value, I expect much more development attention to turn towards it, and I expect the development ethos to more pragmatic and less ideological than Core.

What you say is very true. Although the same phenomenon is present with fiat currency as well. If everyone tried to spend their dollars at the same time, the shelves would be empty and many services full to capacity. Granted it is on a different scale than Bitcoin, but the underlying concept is the same.
Anyone who understands Bitcoin knows there is some chance of a mass exit event that pushes the price to near $0, and then it never recovers. There is a chance. But we now have 8 years of history, 8 years of experience where that has not happened yet. There can flash-crashes for sure, caused by both true panics and fat-fingered traders, and there have been. But the price has always recovered.
The concept of 'weak hands getting shaken out' is a very powerful one. The advantage bitcoin has over fiat is that there are only so many coins. As time goes on, the finale supply of existing coins seeks a more and more stable distribution, moving into the hands of wealthy people who have no desire or reason to spend their whole stash. It also becomes more stable as the general masses holds a small amount No one is really going to panic over fluctuations in the value of $20 worth of money.
Something else to keep in mind is that a necessary condition for the price of a coin to reach a certain level is that almost every active holder needs to think it is worth that much or more. If an active holder thought Bitcoin was truly over-valued at a given price, they would sell.
When Bitcoin first went over $1000 in 2013, I saw it as proof that the big early adopter whales truly thought it would go higher in the long run. Selling would be too much of a risk, since it can always go higher and never turn back. People say that price was artificial, due to the Markus and Willy bots, but the volumes were big enough on Coinbase that anyone could have safely cashed out tens of millions during that mania. The price was real.

Bitcoin's biggest advantage is its liquidity and lack of volatility (when compared to other coins). These are largely derived from the distribution of its coins - which due to have been around the longest, and with a (relatively) slow emissions curve - being the most stable. These are what makes it good money. The tech is all hot-swappable. If Core is to conservative, than chain forks are shaping up to be a means of getting the needed tech in there. It is much easier to give a stable monetary base good technology than it is to create some new architecture and hope that it eventually builds a good monetary base.

Very few technical people think the substance of the proposed changes will be harmful to Bitcoin. The resistance is about the meta issues, how the changes were 'decided', that the hard fork is 'controversial', that the hard fork considers itself 'Bitcoin' and so one.
All of these objections would be there even if the proposal was to increase the blocks from 1MB to 1.01MB. The objections are not about the substance to the change, but the methods.
It is fair that people object to the method. My point is that people who do not like the method should not worry that Bitcoin is doomed to become something that they do not like. They are fearing that a similar method could be used to make changes they truly do not like. I believe the community would respond differently if a harmful change was being proposed.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:53:26

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:19:29
No, I was rude.
I like seeing the value of my holdings go up to. What I am trying to point out is that to the vast majority of Bitcoin holders, the  value of their investment is the combined value of BCH + BTC. So by just holding BTC, you are actually in a very small category of Bitcoin investors. There is safety in numbers. The herd could switch to BCH and most Bitcoin holders would not feel a difference in the value of their investments. You would be wiped out.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:03:10
Splitting coins will be easy. I can think of two simple methods, one that is probabilistic, and one that is certain to work.
Method 1 - Probabilistic 
As soon as the chains have diverged, load the private key in question into one node that follows chains 'A', and into another node that follows chain 'B'. Generate new (and different) receiving addresses on each node's wallet. Create transactions on each node sending the coins from the original "combined" address, to the new and different address. Broadcast them simultaneously.
Of course the transactions may be relayed to the 'other' network. That is okay. Hopefully the transactions that end up confirming are the desired ones. If so, then the coins have been successfully split. If not, you still control the keys to all coins and you can repeat the procedure again. If transaction fees are lower on one chain than the other, the differential can be exploited to greatly increase the odds of a successful split.  Simply broadcast the transaction for the lower-fee chain first with a fee on the low side (on the low side even for the low fee network). As soon as it confirms, broadcast the other transaction on the higher-fee network with an appropriate fee.
Method 2 - Certain
Wait at least 100 blocks until after the split, and get some coins that were mined only on one branch. Add those coins to the address you want to split. Then create a transaction referencing the input that is unique to that branch of the fork. The transaction will never confirm on the other chain because it would be seen as invalid.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:01:34
Perhaps. I hold BTC and BCH in a 1:1 ratio. I like the stability the continuity that Core offers, but I think they have made a critical mistake in their opposition to increasing the base block size and allowing fees to rise into the several-dollar range.
I am glad there is BCH release valve for the community to switch to if they find the high fees intolerable. As the BCH infrastructure develops, I will use it more often. I have been using BTC since 2012, and it has been a year since I send people small amounts to test. Mixing coins via coin-join and such has become prohibitively expensive. If the switch to BCH happens, I will be happy.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:45:28
Some of it is about 2MB blocks, and some of it is about breaking Core's grip on development. Users are aways in control of what they run, full stop. Nothing can change your software, so users should rest easy.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:18:54
There is lots of middle ground between the two extremes you mentioned. Bitcoin is too big now for there to be 'near-universal community consensus' on almost anything. And no one has come up with a way to measure that 'community consensus' anyhow.
2MB blocks do not threaten the fundamentals of the network. I understand people are concerned that the approach used (closed door meetings and a hard fork) could be used to push through changes that do threaten the fundamentals of the network, but the two situations are not analogous. It is likely that at some point a very destructive proposal will be proposed. Only then will we know how the community will respond.

Even if you have taken it upon yourself to define what Bitcoin is for others, you still can not conclude that people are running SegWit without asking them. It was a softfork, and users are free to ignore it. You either don't understand that, or maybe you are just wishing SegWit had been a hard fork, and forced people to see it your way?

Mainstream adoption is the goal, but to get to a destination, you have to take steps, and put on foot after the other, and 2 million is a number between 300k and 50 million. It gets us closer to the goal. And lighting network will still require there to be ample on chain capacity. LN will have a multiplier effect, and the bigger the base blocks are, the bigger the product when leveraged by lightening. Also, even if lighting had an infinite multiplier effect, there is still the bottle neck of just plain-old on boarding people into the channel the first time. Each person joining lightning takes a minimum of 1tx.
If you think all 'big blockers' want 8 GB blocks, you have been driving the kool-aide. Most of us want small, steady increases. As the blocks get bigger, layer 2 tech will continue to develop. With those two approaches combined, I can't see a reason that fees should be higher than about $0.25 now, or in the long run.

It would partly depend on the pools' intentions.  Bitcoin is not immune from corruption, but it does provide its user base with some very robust tools to detect and counteract practices with which it does not agree.
About proof of work: It alone is not enough to guarantee a fair or decentralized system, but on the other hand, it can still be of value in a somewhat centralized system.  There is some security intrinsic to proof of work, which is being able to know about how big of a computer was needed, and how much electricity was consumed to provide you with a given result.  You would know, even if a centralized entity alone was publishing blocks, the expense they incurred to publish any given series of blocks.  PoW eliminates attacks and misrepresentations based on ‘costless simulation’. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:16:16

That is my point. The real test of Bitcoin's resilience will be if a change that is truly harmful gets proposed by powerful forces.


I don't think contentious hard forks are bad, I think they an exercise of freedom. As for the 'source control', hope we move to a many-client model. I think having a 'reference implementation' is harmful, and it would be better if Bitcoin had a reference specification. I think this is an important step on that road.


I mostly agree. But I think it shows had badly Bitcoin Core misjudged the needs of the market. The miners would have absolutely preferred if Core had been willing to deliver a 2MB hard fork.

Good points. Difficult questions. Hard to reason out in the general case.
We are moving into a digital world. Bitcoin's greatest power is the control it affords to an individual, and yet the true power is only available to those who are willing to learn about it. I think just a few days (maybe 10 hours, spread out) would be plenty for people to learn some critical basics about Bitcoin, private keys, etc. Most people would rather browse facebook and watch TV though.
I hope people take some time to learn, since it is not just about Bitcoin.

I disagree with how you think the cartel scenario would unfold.  As long as the cartel had more than 50% of the hash power, they could choose to exclude blocks from miners that did not follow cartel protocol, orphaning them.  Realistically the cartel would need some super-majority of hash power to be effective.  I am convinced that this will eventually come to pass, and I don't think it will be a bad thing.  It will, in fact, be necessary.  See this post:  and the surrounding discussion.

@_date: 2017-11-07 15:36:27
Well, how easily depends on your general skill level in using a computer and in your understanding of Bitcoin.
I consider the simplest, easiest to secure, generally useful tool is a dedicated Bitcoin computer. Get a 5-year old laptop with a 250-GB or greater spinning disk drive. Wipe the drive, install Ubuntu, and then install Bitcoin Core. Don't install anything else! It will take between a day or two to sync up on a fast connection. Ideally get a second old laptop, do same procedure, and install the 2X client.
This is the ideal starting point to follow each chain independently.
If you don't really have a good understanding, it would be best to just do nothing for a few days while the fork plays out. As long as your have your BTC on a private key before the fork, you will be fine. Perhaps send just a small amount of BTC to a few different addresses right now, and you can then use those to test out splitting coins after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:24:29

I see that too. I think it is push back against the idea the "Bitcoin" is defined by the Bitcoin Core developers. At this point many people agree it is a battle for the brand and title of "Bitcoin", and it is a powerful argument that "Bitcoin" was defined by Satoshi. I agree it would be foolish to blindly follow the white paper, but unless the community can come up with a way to better define it's goals, I think the white paper will continue to serve a unique roll.

The way you are describing how and why Bitcoin ought to be seen as a gold replacement is essentially that it has failed at being used for payments.

I do not see the Visa comparison as relevant. Rather, I look at the ratio between 300k and 2 million, and see that Bitcoin Cash can facilitate 6 times the transaction load that Bitcoin can, and I see that as meaningful in its own right.


This is just one theory. Another is that Bitcoin has value because it is "a peer-to-peer electronic cash system". And I should mention that the digital gold theory only gained credence once some people came to the conclusion that the electronic cash version would not work. Other people still see the original vision as workable.


I would guess people would switch if they felt fees were high enough to warrant larger blocks and a hard-fork to get them, but only if they felt the system could handle the larger block size. It is complicated to reason out, but there are plenty of smart people thinking thinking it though.

I agree.  The security practices of the network need to be in relation to the threats.  If Bitcoin is used only by a few people and 'outlawed' by society, then it must go underground.  And it can do that if it needs to. OTOH, as you point out, if it becomes widely used and socially acceptable, the array of threats facing it will change, and it can adopt a different security posture.

You really have it backwards. The greater the capacity, the more expensive it would be to sustain at DoS attack at a given price level.
Think about a wire carrying electricity. If the wire is bigger, and there is a circuit and a load, it takes more total energy to saturate the wire (overheating being the DoS equivalent) than it does a smaller wire. In the analogy energy is the equivalent to transaction fees.
There are disadvantages to Bitcoin Cash, but being less expensive to perform a 'spam attack' is not one of them. It would cost more to attack BCH in this way than BTC, not less.

Whether such an action would be an 'attack' is debatable.  The mechanism might be the same as hostile miners would use, but the goals of the cartel and the effects of the action must be considered.  I am thinking miners might band together to stop a 'race to the bottom' of fees that would undermine the funding necessary to secure the network.  If the cartel abused that power and began to truly over charge for their services, users would probably defect to an alt-coin of some sort.
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:29:03


That is your opinion.  Unless Satoshi said something to the effect that I am missing?  Everyone knows that space on the Blockchain is a finite resource, and transnational demand is potentially infinite.  We all know transactions must have some cost.  No one thinks tx's should be free.  But how much should they cost?  And who decides that?  In my minds eye, I can see envision a healthy Bitcoin system functioning on 5¢ txs.  Maybe 5¢ isn't cheap?


The only way Bitcoin can support such transactions if it is dual-use.  The network as we know it can and would be shut down if the 'illegal usage' was all that it was used for.  New laws would be passed.  Exchanges would be outlawed.  Miners would have to register.  Developers could be harassed for 'supporting terrorism'.  The government might even conduct sustained 51% attacks.  Of course the ideas of crypto-currencies  would live on, and people would continue to explore and develop new methods, but Bitcoin would be seriously harmed.  That is why there has been such a major push to make Bitcoin "main-stream".  When there is testimony before Congress, and there are questions about Bitcoin being used for drugs, etc., the Bitcoiners' answer "and those people are getting caught" and "we support KYC/AML".  Then they talk about all the "legitimate" uses of Bitcoin.  Almost all of us here want a freer world, but many understand that that means some amount of appeasement and cooperation with the government for the time being.  We should be grateful they have provided room and opportunity for Bitcoin to grow.

Everyone MUST understand that the political and economic considerations (about how the world works) are the larger framework in which this debate is taking place.  Of course everyone wants functional, bug-free code.  But how much decentralization is enough?  That is a political and economic question.  In the technical debate, there are always trade offs.  If there is a proposal gives 10x the transaction capacity, and slightly lessens the amount of 'decentralization', whether that is good thing is not strictly a technical question.  The key aspect of that hypothetical is whether or not Bitcoin needs the full degree of decentralization it has to maintain the properties its users find valuable.  There is no sense in paying the high cost for far more decentralization than is needed.  We don't need infinite decentralization, some amount of human control is okay, unavoidable, and in some cases, perhaps even desirable.  It's also likely that different segments of the user base will require decentralization to different degrees.  I understand the argument that the base layer should remain 'censorship resistant' and that layers with more human control can be build on top.  But that doesn't fully address the question of how much decentralization is enough for that base layer, and that many people might be willing to accept a little bit more centralization in exchange for lower fees, more convenience - and perhaps in the future - for staying within the bounds of the law (that's if the laws are passed). 
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:56:22
Good points.  Those are all reasons why I love Bitcoin.  The point I was trying to make is that decentralization is just a means - and as you point out - to several or many ends.  The other ends that you described are not purely technical in nature either, there is a wide range of political and economic considerations that determine whether a given degree of centralization is too much to allow for the desired properties.  Further complicating that question is that matter of risk and probability.  As we rightly try to peer into the likelihood of the network's desirable traits being compromised, people come to very different conclusions based on their world-views, life experience, political persuasions, etc.  That would be the case even if everyone had the exact same understanding of the technical proposals and trade-offs being considered.
@_date: 2016-02-14 04:42:51
How are they separate at all?  I'll answer - they are not.  The reason the blocksize is an issue is because of centralization concerns, and there exits no technical way of measuring 'decentralization'.  We consider the network to be sufficiently decentralized in practice if it functions in the censorship resistant way we expect, if it resists regulation, if it remains cryptographically audible, if it follows the economic contract Satoshi laid out, etc. etc..  And we don't want it to merely have such functionality today, but we expect it to have some margin of safety; we expect it to remain comfortably beyond the reach of governmental attempts to alter those properties.
It's true that people who can't tell a megabyte from kilobit, or RAM from "storage", stand no chance of offering constructive input on the question of blocksize.  But even technical knowledge alone is not sufficient to understand how much centralization a given block size will result in, as political and economic factors affect that as well.  For instance: what is the cost of electricity?  Is mining banned, taxed, or regulated?  And that isn't even looking at what effects a given level of centralization might entail, which again is the realm of politics and economics.
The blocksize relates to the amount of centralization, which is a combination of technical, economics, and politics.  Decentralization is just a means to some ends, so whether or not the network is sufficiently decentralized depends on if the users are getting what they want.  As to the future ability of the network to remain sufficiently decentralized, that again takes a combination of technical, political and economic thinking and expertise to understand.
Or course we need technical input, and we are lucky to have some excellent programmers working on this project.  The suggestions that this a fully technical debate however, is just wrong.  And frankly, it turns off many people and sours the debate when the suggestion is made that their input is not applicable because "this is a purely technical matter".  It is not.
@_date: 2016-02-13 20:22:07
I mostly agree.  Censorship is always possible though, that's why 'censorship resistant' is the term that people tend to use.  Of course we need to be careful about things that reduce Bitcoin's censorship resistance!  My point is that that is not purely a technical question, though it certainly does have a technical dimension.

@_date: 2017-04-14 23:01:54
This is a common perspective shared on both "sides" of the block size debate. It an issue that 'cuts across party lines' if you will.
There are a group of people who at least profess to not care about dominance, market cap, etc.. As long as Bitcoin stays true to its central principles they argue, it has succeeded. To me, that means they would think it had succeeded even if just them and their 10 friends were the only ones in the world using it.
It's clear to me that the dominant cryptocurrency will be one that makes some compromises and trade-offs as it grows into mainstream usage. If Bitcoin makes those concessions, it won't be the 'purest form of money' that it's most die-hard supporters hope it would become. Those people suggest anything less will just be an inefficient version of PayPal. What they are failing to visualize is that there is a vast, vast area of middle ground. Bitcoin can be somewhat less pure than they hoped, while still being far better than the current banking system and its subsidiaries.
The most stubborn of these view points is the idea that "100 percent of users need to agree" on any changes in order for the resultant system to be "Bitcoin". They'll say anything else is a "shit-coin".
Due to the very real pressure from alt-coins, IMHO Bitcoin either needs to grow (and grow quickly), or it will die. For all of the people who say that won't happen, just like any central bank, if there is ever a currency collapse, they won't be anywhere to be seen.

The problem with saying "1MB is fine, 2MB might be okay, and 4MB is dangerous" is that such fine-grained distinctions can only be meaningfully resolved when many other variables are held constant - and the truth about many of those other variables is that we only have very rough ranges to what the values may be.  And some of those variables are indeed political in nature. 
 And example is "how much censorship-resistant bandwidth is available?"  This is one of the variables that determines what a safe block size can be.  It has political dimensions and there is no way actually measure it.  We can only guess about what amount of bandwidth would remain available in the face of an attack, and clearly, the nature of the attack would be the determining factor.  We don't even know that Bitcoin with 1MB would survive such an attack.
And the risk of Bitcoin failing can never be measured by only considering the chance that a full-on government attack succeeds, one must also consider how likely that attack is to take place.  I believe that golbal commercial integration of Bitcoin, and popular support, makes the chance that governments will attack it less likely.
Back to my original point, another variable that cannot be easily measured are the economic incentives that drive mining.  Cheap / free electricity vs orphan rates. 
Also, if 1 MB is just barely workable today, what do we make of the fact the it was the same limit 7 years ago?  Was Bitcoin broken then?  Some amount of optimism is needed for Bitcoin to work.  Many smart people have looked at it and said "this will never work", including many who are now Bitcoin developers.  There has always been risk with Bitcoin.  Consider the banker perspective - they would look at Bitcoin and first say "this can't work", then a few years later "maybe there is something here", then finally, "well this can be made to work, be we need to add the ability to undo transactions sometimes".  
Luke-JR says 1 MB is too big.  What does that even mean?  It's clear that he has a different vision for "Bitcoin" than Satoshi did.  I believe that most of the Core Devs who want 1 MB (or smaller) really want a censorship resistant money for the internet.  But the are no longer in favor of Satoshi's vision.  I am not appealing to authority - they will probably argue that we have learned much since then and they have discovered problems with the way Satoshi envisioned things unfolding, and their plans will better uphold Satoshi's goals.  They may even be correct in that.  The problem is that there is no public list of goals, there is no formal "Bitcoin Constitution".  Following Satoshi's plan was the only thing that bound the community together.
We absolutely need some documents spelling out, in plain english, what the Bitcoin project's social and economic goals are  if we are going to deviate from Satoshi's plan.  u/nullc , in IRC, called such an concept "just a rhetorical tool" (paraphrasing from memory).  I can see why skilled programmers would rather read the code itself, but the rest of the world would be better off with a document spelling out the principles that the code is working to support.  Then the experts can have battles as to whether or not the code is upholding those principles.

Efficiency has to be measured in terms of a stated goal, and you have not stated one.  Efficiency by itself is not an absolute concept.  I take a guess an assume you are referring to the massive redundancy inherent in Bitcoin's design, redundancy which far exceeds that which is needed for 'backup purposes'.  Of course, the redundancy is needed for independent verification, for 'trustlessness'.


They do.  But that is far from there only attribute.  Full transparency, in the form of crytographic audibility, is very important, as is transaction irreversibly.  You may argue that irreversibly derives from censorship resistance, but Satoshi's argument was that it stems from the P2P nature of the network, from the removal of trusted third parties, who can be compelled to intermediate disputes.


What evidence have you seen that supports this conclusion?


That statement only makes sense if you believe that the uses are mutually exclusive.  Otherwise there is no reason to think that adding the 'mass-adoption' use case would somehow drive out the other one.  I'm guessing that is what you are suggesting, I disagree.
Related is that censorship resistance is itself on a spectrum, with higher degrees of censorship resistance coming at increased costs.  This is political-economic question that at some point will have to be addressed.

The Blockchain is 'immutable evidence', which is very similar to how the government operates. Consider the court records for a child pornography case. I would assume the court keeps at least on copy of the photographs / data in question. We therefore, as a society, already accept that the mere *possession* of such information is not in all cases bad. It is a question of intent. We *trust* (the general public) that courts are doing the right thing, and have that "bad data" for the right reasons, so most people have people never even considered the court building as massive repository of terrible, horrible images.
If you have no intent to interpret strings of data in ways that violate social norms or laws, just relax and don't give it a second thought. If people accuse you of something, you may have to think about it again for the purposes of explaining to them that you use the blockchain for x, y &amp; z, but not for what they are accusing you of, and you have no idea what they are they are even referring to. You could even ask them how they know the data they are alleging is present is there, like, did they look at some bad pictures to "confirm"?

Any post that talks about how many 'minutes' it took to get a confirmation is subtly spreading mis-information. In the context of what the OP is describing, it is how many CONFIRMATIONS since they broadcast their tx which is meaningful.
With a 4-minute confirmation time, we can guess it was included in the first available block, but it reasonably could have been passed over by two intervening blocks.
Discussing how many confirmations occurred before inclusion tells us something about the health of the network, whereas discussing how many minutes tells us about a particular set of randomly distributed blocks in relation to the actions of an individual.
Not suggesting ill-intent from the OP.
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:15:45


You can keep saying that, but it doesn't make it true. We are not talking about physical photographs in someone's desk, we are talking about fragments of binary data that require specialized tools and user intent before they be part of a process that results in images being displayed.
I would probably feel differently if this was like polio, and we were on the verge of "eliminating" CP forever, and these links in the blockchain, when interpreted by specialized tools, yielded the disease. In that case, hopefully we could make the needed changes to the chain to eradicate it forever from the earth.
But it is not like that. Sadly there are probably exabytes of such information floating around, and even sadder is that new content is created daily. And certainly a blockchain is not the only - or even a primary - avenue for acquisition or distribution of such content.
We are discussing the idea of taint, and the idea that public dataset can be be tainted by a few people illegally inserting some specially encoded info . If the Bitcoin blockchain were a movie, intended to be replayed visually, and Bitcoin Core was a video player, and transactions were frames in the movie... if certain frames showed CP... I would agree with you.
I am not defending the intent of the people who encode or decode such images. I am defending everyone else who just posses or transmits fragments of information without regard to their contents of meaning. I am defending against the idea that someone can maliciously taint something in this way. Go after those who choose to decode the information, purposefully, to render objectionable images.
* edit - Consider BIP 39, or other methods to encode data as a series of common words. Using a certain method, a sentence could be converted into a number, and into a picture. In the case of a 24 word sequence that could be decoded into CP, would you think that such a sequence of words should be banned?  And a the bonus question: how would you tell people which sequence of words they were not allowed to say without first telling them the words?

A cryptographically-secure IOU perhaps? 
BTC in lightning channels are more 'at risk' than on-chain BTC. I am a big fan and have a capitalized main-net lighting node running, but lightning does have complex security properties that differ in many ways from traditional bitcoin usage.
They are not like an IOU in that in a classic IOU, the borrower could simply default, and with lightning, that is not a risk. However, they are like an IOU in the sense that if one considers 'settlement' to be when the lightning channel is closed, there is chance settlement could resolve to any one of the intermediate channel states, and one of the parties in the channel could suffer a loss of funds at the expense of their counterparty. It's not just up to chance though, any attack can (and must!) be defended against, and I personally beleive the security properties of the LN to be quite reasonable (except for a mass-exit scenario... that needs to be resolved). But still, BTC in an active channel differs quite markedly from BTC in cold storage. That is probably why some people like to think of it as an IOU, an analogy that could be helpful or unhelpful depending on how it is framed.

Well yes, because Bitcoin will enable all kinds of services that people currently don't even see due to the permission-less and 'programable' nature of it. Even if the average person does not want to manage their coins themselves, and would rather pay a premium for the privilege of having someone to blame, they are still going to want to use these new services that only bitcoin enables. And also, as I was saying about, Bitcoin will be able to drive down the cost of even offering these 'managed' services to consumers, since Bitcoin will prove to be a more efficient back end.

I depends on how widely (geographically) and deep (hops) they want to push the blacklist. If they see 1 BTC go to "1XYZ" address, and declare that coin "illegal", it can be traced forever on the chain, though the concept of 'taint analysis'. It just depends on how far they want to go with it. Yes, at some point it would ensnare innocent victims. You could have a legit business and sell some Alpaca socks for BTC, and later, when you try to sell some BTC for fiat, you find the exchanges just shut down your account. The government could argue that it is *your responsibility* to ensure any coins you accept have not ever been associated with addresses on their list.
There would obviously be major pushback, including legal, political, and technological challenges to such severe attempts. I think it is unlikely the US Gvt would push it that far.

It is really a test of how much you - or anyone - actually value the blockchain being censorship resistant. Censorship resistant means that people can and will do things with it that you don't like, and it certainly means people will use the blockchains to communicate things you or I don't agree with.
-Links to child porn
-Detonation of bombs
-Ransom demands
etc. etc.
Just remember, the blockchain is just a tool of communication, it is just a database... it is just data. Even the idea that it could contain a 'picture' - no. It does not contain a picture any more than it can contain a dollar bill, or a kitten. Yes, it can contain data that can be interpreted a certain way to show a certain picture on the computer. And typically people only get upset when a more common method of data interpretation can reveal a bad picture, such as reading the data as if it were a jpeg. Go ahead and interpret the data as a hex dump and see if there is any "image".
My point is not to defend people who do bad things - they should be caught and given the help and/or punishment they deserve. My point is that the idea of criminalizing certain data is an extremely dangerous concept. That data, sitting there on your hard drive, is just ones and zeros. There is no image until you choose to render it onto a screen or paper. I think it is fine to consider the whole context of an individual's behavior, if there is evidence they are doing inappropriate things with there data / computers / monitors / internet connection.
The Bitcoin software I run has no ability to display any sort of images or links derived from data in the chain.

Anything can mis-used and mis-represented by people with an agenda. I try to ignore attempts by others to hijack useful words or analogies that I might use. It's the same with 'political correctness'. There have been words that were neutral descriptors, and then came into common usage as a pejorative, and then they are no longer 'allowed' to be use. In the most 'sensitive' examples, it is certainly easier to refrain from using the terms, rather than causing a storm of social condemnation. But I don't put terms like "IOU" into that category.

Anyone who has a computer which has data on it, potentially.
Lets say the illegal number is 1,000,000. Any who has data that represents that number is guilty. Bob is alleged to have data representing that number, but Bob protests, and says he only has data representing the number 250,000, and his files confirm that. But the prosecution then presents the number 750,000, which they argue that Bob planned to combine with his other value to yield 1,000,000.
In such a society, the only safe number becomes 0, or null, in which case the 'unlocking' number would have to be equal to the illegal data itself.

Spot on u/Bitdigester!
And anyone in innocently in possession of that list (perhaps IT is encoded in the blockchain) is also not culpable. It really comes down to intent, and one way that might be established is be looking if a user is in possession of all the necessary tools to display such images.
Even then, it is has always been a scary idea that just the configuration of a hard drive could be enough to put someone away for life or ruin their reputation forever. Framing someone is just too easy, or someone being found 'guilty' when they have no idea what is happening on their machine, as most people don't. It is very different if someone has a collection of physical photographs in their possession, with their fingerprints on them. And I have no issue with the idea that a collection of data and / or the tools for rendering such images can be used as evidence as part of a larger case against someone.

Without significant changes to the law, I don't really see the point. On the surface, it sounds great; that securities can be traded on a blockchain without all of the friction of legacy systems. But without FULL, legislative backing, which sanctifies that the blockchain is the absolute authoritative record of ownership for the shares and underlying asset, there will be major issues down the line.
What happens when there is an alleged hack? Someone goes to a court and sues, claiming they have been deprived of their rightful ownership, and demand restitution. If the court sides with the plaintiff, the judgement could be enforced in a least two ways.
1) The underlying asset is seized and sold, or it's income is garnished at the expense of future dividends, or
2) A court-enforced chain fork could be mandated, invalidating certain tokens and issuing new tokens to the plaintiff.
Either way, control of the underlying asset will rest with a court. The current systems are unwieldy almost for the exclusive reason of meeting legal requirements, and these requirements exist either to satisfy the surveillance state, or to make sure that ownership is transferred in a legally binding way.
Purchasing ownership of real property on-chain would expose the buyer to significant risks. Satoshi even noted this on the first page of the Bitcoin white paper, writing (with respect to third parties) "Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes."

An older-pc. The kind that a typical user or hobbiest could reasonably afford to buy used (or might have sitting around), and could be re-purposed as a dedicated node. It can still be done today for under $200 in many parts of the world.
It is unknown at this point whether or not the differences between the trust models, or the "trivial" amount of security gained will be meaningful or not. Do you understand the situation that might split those two "slightly" different trust models into vastly different outcomes?

There is also reason (d), that many services stopped using Bitcoin due to high fees and slow confirmations.

Hopefully the LN can quickly become functional, and we can being to reclaim some the transactions we have lost to (d) and (e).

Indeed, IF the prevailing legal framework (which would require comprehensive legislation, IMO) shifted to fully back the concept of crypto tokens, then we could re-examine the value of the system in the context of the new legal framework.
The NYSE is only a semi-trusted intermediary, at least in the context of shares backed by real property (lets keep the example simple for the sake of discussion). Final jurisdiction of who 'owns' and gets to use a piece of property is the decisions of courts, the police, and typically government at the state and local level. It is those governing bodies who's consent really matters.
Contrast that to Bitcoin, where it matters nothing what a local jurisdiction think, at least in relation to who gets to own and control certain 'coins'.

First, let me be clear that anyone engaging in the exploitation of children should be stopped, and either punished or given treatment as necessary, and that includes people selling, buying, creating, or enjoying pornographic images of children.
Now let me get a little bit meta in looking at your comment, while keeping in mind the context of this discussion (the allegation of 'childporn' on the blockchain). Files don't 'depict' anything. They are not 'images'. Even the idea of a 'file' as a discrete data structure is just about consensus, agreement, and conventions. There is no 'image' or 'picture' visible to the eye until someone brings addition data, processing and rendering into the - pardon the pun - picture.
Intent really matters. If someone is using an additional set of tools to interpret the data in such as way as to create actual images, available for the eye to see, and they are doing to purposefully (and presumably for their enjoyment), that certainly crosses a line and must be dealt with.
Look - you have data on your computer. You probably don't imagine it is in any way related to or associated with kiddie porn. But without a doubt, there are tools and processes and complementary data which could take the data or files on your computer as input, and show bad things on a screen.
Consider a one-tme pad. The 'data' and the 'key' are equal in information richness and length. Which becomes which? Maybe I am wrong, but my understanding is they become indistinguishable from each other. So which one would "contain" the bad image? Now let us imagine I use AES to encrypt a file. The data is meaningless without the key, and the key is meaningless without the data. So which is the 'bad' part? Maybe they both are bad? Okay, so lets say I encrypt the evil data with your public key. Did your key become evil? It would be a necessary component of turning cyphertext into something people could validate was bad.
In order to turn data consisting of 1's and 0's into an image that people can view with their own eyes, many steps are needed. Shame on anyone who takes these steps to render reprehensible images! And shame on anyone who sells data as such, with the intent and understanding that people would use it for exploitative purposes, or that they would attempt to render it into reprehensible images.
But when it comes to the Bitcoin blockchain, I use it for financial transactions. I interpret the data with a program that does not attempt to render images. I know not of this 'bad data' of which you speak.

Well, there does have to be *some* level of fee pressure. We can expect, that as with a gas, transactions volumes will rise to fill whatever space is available to them. I think we could have 8-MB blocks today, and perhaps even 16-MB. But we would have to hold at the level for a long time, since the effects on node sync time lag far behind the block size.
If 16-MB blocks were full, that is 800GB / year, so we get 7 years from a $150 6/TB hard drive, and that is a spinning drive. But as for syncing time, lets say it takes 4 days to sync now with a spinning disk on a 5-year old laptop. That is 4-days per 200/GB of chain data. Every year of 16-MB blocks would take an additional 16 days to validate. So by next year we would be at 20 days to sync, and three years from now it would take 52 days, and 6 years out? 100 days to sync the chain.
It is reasonable to expect performance improvements would pull that number lower, but we shouldn't assume miracles. So the sync times would keep getting longer due as the chain grows longer, but shorter as computers get faster. At some point we can assume we would hit a  maximum sync time, after which the exponential increases in performance would win out over the linear increases in block length.
But for 16-MB blocks, that reversal could be 5 - 15 years away, and how long would it take to sync at the max? It seems like it could easily be many months.
So yeah, I think we could handle 16-MB today, although I would prefer 8-MB. But it couldn't be the first increase of many, at least not with Bitcoin remaining something that we want people to able to validate themselves.

That is true. However, decentralization is just a means to various ends. In the recent drama, people have been worried that hashpower might be supporting something that could lead to something else that could ultimately compromise the decentralization, and therefor the ends.
There is little evidence of disagreement among or between users, businesses and miners when it comes to the core functionality that bitcoin provides. There is massive disagreement when it comes to how those ends can best be achieved. In the end, people value the results.

And if they have the software, knowledge of which blocks, and intent to recreate such images. Who is providing a list of the blocks? A major part of the issue here is that we are dealing with fragmented information, and the allegation that a fragment can be 'illegal'. The fragments by themselves are innocuous. Only when combined in certain with other data, in certain ways, is the result troubling. The problem is that information theory is powerful, and ANY fragment can be part of ANY whole. And it's really not complete is this instance until it is displayed on a screen or printed out.


My point was that 'we' accept that the data itself is not problematic, but certain usages of it. We accept that if the data is being used to persecute bad people, it may be stored and displayed to a court room full of people, and that that is a 'good' use of the data.
Anyway, your point is beside my point, but it doesn't make sense anyway. By that logic, you would think it would be okay if someone possessed such images as long as they tried to keep it just for themselves, and not 'accessible by anyone'. I doubt you agree that such would be acceptable.

It seems like we have a similar understanding that a key part of the issue has to do with 'public standards' of interpretation.

But what if I told you the same thing in my own language - which no one else understands - which to you might sound like "gha-lar toup molo". And no, I will no interpret it for you! I am not staying that is exactly analogous to the data on the blockchain, but it gets to the idea about 'public standards' of decoding, aka, interpretation.
If people were using Bitcoin Core and seeing images pop up on their screen, there would be a problem. But in this case, the data only becomes problematic with special tools to parse the files. I say the problem lies with the people and those special tools they are using to attempt to turn financial a specialized financial data base into something bad. Those special tools are hardly a 'public standard'.
Also - if there were a legal list of parsing / interpretation methods (the public standards) to test against, we could soft-fork in rules that any block, or series of blocks, shall not, when parsed with such tools in the specified way, yields any sort of image. But without that list, it can be a witch hunt.

For the first two years of Bitcoin's existance, it's exchange value was less than a dollar, and for much of that time it's value wasn't even tracked.  Approximately 5 million bitcoins were mined during that time period.  There are many stories of people mining hundreds or thousands of BTC and then losing them. Some forgot their private keys, and others didn't back up their wallets. These losses could amount to some hundreds of thousands of BTC. Then there are Satoshi's coins, 1 Million of them, which haven't moved since they were mined. It's unclear whether these will ever move again, or even can move again.  Once the value of a single BTC moved above $1 (and then on to $31!), the chance increased that people would treat their digital stash with care.

The currently centralization of mining due to latency is absolutely negligible. Hashrate would have the same distribution if the blocks were 1Kb each. Electricity costs, hardware costs, labors costs and overhead costs are all cheaper in China than just about anywhere else.

The validity of those concerns is speculative. There is fervent disagreement about whether or not the process you find concerning is or could lead to features we all value in Bitcoin becoming compromised.


You don't have to serve blocks for free to other nodes. If you are just downloading and validating, 8MB blocks would be 35 GB / month. 56k modems and ISDN aside, that is well within the realm of even 1.5 Mbps DSL . We ought not to design the network with the slowest connections in mind (morse code? smoke signals?), but rather by looking at average connections. 35GB / month is reasonable.


That is irrelevant to my point. You are confusing the key traits of Bitcoin with technical practicalities. Funds not being frozen, the chain remaining auditable, fungibility, permissionless use, 21 million coins, etc., are the key features. The idea that not all coffee should be recorded on the chain is a conclusion you have reached based on technical considerations. If the key features could be preserved and we could all buy coffee on chain, that would be great. Preventing people from making small purchases is not a feature of Bitcoin, if anything it may be an inconvenient reality.


You don't know that. You are speculating


1st) There is still trust in Bitcoin now, and there always will be. 
2nd) Peer to peer is a means to an ends


Not all rules are the same. I could say the same thing about a handful of Core devs 'controlling bitcoin', but the reality is it depends on people going along with the changes. If 17% of the companies push for a rule change that is in itself, reasonable, I and perhaps a majority of the community will support it. If these same companies propose something like 'we as companies get 1,000,000 free coins!', they would clearly just be laughed at.
It is a slippery slope fallacy. Show me a damaging change that is about to adopted and I'll be convinced. 8MB is fine. 16MB would be fine. Mining is already centralized, and centralized under control of a single government. Clearly Bitcoin's value is not predicated on mining being geographically dispersed.

They are not exclusive. It got driven to 19k off FOMO, but it would have never hit those heights if long term holders and early adopters didn't think the tech was worth it. And some major holders hodl just out of ideology. But yeah, many old timers would consider it too risky to sell at 19k (and 10k, and 5k and 3k, and 2k etc.) because they see the long term value as being much higher. Perhaps you recognize the current price is likely higher than current value, but selling is risky, because with every passing day, the true value increases. The price can jump very high, and then stay there or even go higher, while the true value builds underneath. When the price does fall, if the true value has grown, the bottom will be higher.
It is hard to imagine how high the price will be when hundreds of millions or billions of people are using the LN to make fast and cheap payments on a daily basis...

Sorry, that is flawed logic.
All that '4 exchanges getting out of the agreement' is proof of is that they left the agreement. To assess support levels, one has to look at the whole picture. Perhaps 5 other exchanges joined during the time the 4 you referred to left. All else being equal, that would mean support had *risen* during that time.
Perhaps support is dwindling. Maybe it is rising. I don't know. What I do know is your treatment of a few data points as 'proof' of a trend is deeply flawed. Perhaps it would be better to ask questions rather than spout BS. Sorry to be harsh, but cluttering discussion channels hurts all of us who value quality discourse.

That is a good point as well, and should be taken into account for an accurate calculation.  However, it still stands that previously lost coins need to be subtracted from the denominator, while - as you point out - coins lost today, or this month, or this year, should be subtracted from the numerator. Of course today's numerators adds to tomorrows denominator in this case.
I was making the point about previously lost coins since so many were lost when the coins had little value.  It's true that coins are lost every day, but that number is probably but a tiny fraction of the 1,800 BTC which are minted daily. At some point though, BTC will truly become deflationary :)

I choose to counter FUD with accurate information, not with going to the opposite extreme in a (misguided, IMO) attempt to create balance.


I provided a nuanced explanation above, which you seem to have ignored. A classic IOU has counterparty risk in that the borrower might just 'disappear', or otherwise never pay back the money owed. That would fit into the category of failure "you could possibly not get your money back due to being defrauded". Lightning does not suffer from the risk that the counterparty (analogous to the 'borrower' in the classic IOU) will just default or disappear.
But lighting funds, depending on the history of the channel, are susceptible to invalid closes, as you agreed. Those do have a risk profile, and absolutely could result in the counterparty making off with funds that should belong to you, which fits into the same category of "you could possibly not get your money back due to being defrauded". 
Note that regular Bitcoin transactions don't have this additional risk.
If you are not honest about the risks that the Lightning Network fund are susceptible to, people will not be as aware, and as a community we will miss out on on mindshare that could have been devoted to solving those issues or otherwise reducing the risks.

My understanding is the "asset" is legally owned by a company, which itself if legally owned by its shareholders. The exchange just facilitates the buying and sell of shares between people. The exchange itself isn't in the business of of owning shares in companies.
As for a stock buyer having a claim against the exchange? I doubt it unless it was shown the exchange was issuing fraudulent shares. I actually don't know the exact mechanics of how shares and ownership are tracked and recorded, but I can say the whole process follows decades of established legal precedent, and that is exactly what you should do if you want to be as safe from legal challenge as possible.
The only parallel concept with Bitcoin is the idea of 'Blacklisting' coins, but for that to even begin to be effective, you would have to have a judgement that was enforceable in every country on earth, since coins deemed illegal in one jurisdiction could just be transferred elsewhere. The Hotel in NYC, in contrast, has no hope of relocating to avoid the U.S. legal control.

It would be easy to have the block slowly trickle in to disguise the bandwidth signature.
Miners clearly do need to receive blocks quickly, but the current state of mining is highly centralized and subject to government intervention.

The validity of those concerns is speculative. There is fervent disagreement about whether or not the process you find concerning is or could lead to features we all value in Bitcoin becoming compromised.


You don't have to serve blocks for free to other nodes. If you are just downloading and validating, 8MB blocks would be 35 GB / month. 56k modems and ISDN aside, that is well within the realm of even 1.5 Mbps DSL . We ought not to design the network with the slowest connections in mind (morse code? smoke signals?), but rather by looking at average connections. 35GB / month is reasonable.


That is irrelevant to my point. You are confusing the key traits of Bitcoin with technical practicalities. Funds not being frozen, the chain remaining auditable, fungibility, permissionless use, 21 million coins, etc., are the key features. The idea that not all coffee should be recorded on the chain is a conclusion you have reached based on technical considerations. If the key features could be preserved and we could all buy coffee on chain, that would be great. Preventing people from making small purchases is not a feature of Bitcoin, if anything it may be an inconvenient reality.


You don't know that. You are speculating


1st) There is still trust in Bitcoin now, and there always will be. 
2nd) Peer to peer is a means to an ends


Not all rules are the same. I could say the same thing about a handful of Core devs 'controlling bitcoin', but the reality is it depends on people going along with the changes. If 17% of the companies push for a rule change that is in itself, reasonable, I and perhaps a majority of the community will support it. If these same companies propose something like 'we as companies get 1,000,000 free coins!', they would clearly just be laughed at.
It is a slippery slope fallacy. Show me a damaging change that is about to adopted and I'll be convinced. 8MB is fine. 16MB would be fine. Mining is already centralized, and centralized under control of a single government. Clearly Bitcoin's value is not predicated on mining being geographically dispersed.

On the one hand, I totally agree with what you are saying.
• All data is arbitrary. And certainly with cryptography, we can choose our public keys. Or practically, at least a part of them.
• The dicks on the cave wall need no interpretation (as long as the painter did a decent job). Anyone can walk in an understand what they are seeing, and that has almost surely been the case for the 10k years since they were drawn.


That is exactly the problem here... and I mean the problem with holding the blockchain accountable. Future software can be created to interpret any data in any way possible. I am not trying to suggest this is a way of exculpating people who are legitimately engaged in exploitive practices - and the law as plenty of tools available to deal with such cases.
I could write a letter to my congress person, and request that it be entered into the congressional record. The letter could have sounded 'normal'. But supposes I had a secret encoding, and when decoded, that letter resulted in a series of bits that when displayed according to a certain protocol, yielded a bad picture. I think it is insane to think that all of a sudden that letter must expunged from the record, and everyone one with knowledge / in possession of the letter is a criminal. I mean the letter is not a picture, it is a series of words.
Practically speaking though, if the bitcoin blockchain ever became a feasible method by which large volumes of such content were being distributed (and by large, I mean a favored distribution channel, or a significant/major in comparison with other methods), then I would agree it could not be ignored. But as it stands today, it is more of a 'gotcha' type thing.
That is why I take the stance that there are no images, just arbitrary bits. If people want to attempt to render them in illegal and reprehensible images on their screen or printer, that is terrible and they should get their due.
I also think of the Three Wise Monkeys ("see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil") , and so I looked them up, and found this:
•In Buddhist tradition, the tenets of the proverb are about not dwelling on evil thoughts.
•In the Western world both the proverb and the image are often used to refer to a lack of moral responsibility on the part of people who refuse to acknowledge impropriety, looking the other way or feigning ignorance
I have always understood the proverb in the Eastern sense, but seeing how the West often sees its meaning, well, it's a basically the opposite :)
And finally, image the hard drive with bad files gets transported back into the stone age, and the cavemen are all standing around looking at it. The will see no images.

He was rude in his answer, but mostly correct. What makes a blockchain a worthwhile thing at all is when no one is in control of it. If I have ten computers around the world all working together to validate stuff and build a hash-linked database, it reduces to multi-sig since I am in control. Multi-sig is effective for many use cases, but it is not a blockchain.

The technology is not, but the Bitcoin Lightning Network will just be for Bitcoin. The network will benefit from high liquidity in the channels which will be very hard for smaller coins to match.
There is an aspect of speculation, but also one of investment. The money buyers put in and holders keep in is what, overall, is funding the development of the technology and network. We aren't just free-riders, or sports fans betting on their team's outcome. And all growth investment is basically speculatory. Amazon didn't always turn profits, and Tesla currently loses money. People have to have a vision of the future, and be willing to commit to actualizing that vision, for us to make any sort of forward movement in society.
And finally, I actually do think mass adoption in much closer. I think within 6 months there are going to be a number of quite practical online applications for the LN and within 18 months the LN will be processing $5 - $50 million/day in actual economic activity (buying things, funding online accounts, etc.), and perhaps billions / day within 5 years. Not that there will be an authoritative way to measure this, but there still will be a truth, even if it is unknown.
What will propel it forward will be the new apps and services that LN will enable and make practical.

"Fearmongering" would be uncalled for. The important thing with Bitcoin is that coins can only be spent once. There are Bitcoin "printing presses", but the miners must follow the inflation curve. As time goes on, the existing coins will become more and more evenly distributed, which should lower volatility and increase the value of each BTC.
However, OTC trades absolutely do affect the market. Perhaps not as acutely as a massive market sell on an exchange. Who ever is buying OTC, they would be going to an exchange if they could not acquire OTC. So selling OTC is reducing the number of buyers who go to exchanges (simply put).

Incorrect. Mining is centralized in China because of, and I restate: electricity costs, hardware costs, physical infrastructure costs, and personnel costs.
Go ahead and make the block interval 10 days and the blocks 1KB. You know what? Mining would still be centralized in China.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:23:15
The longer the interval, the smaller the chance that a solved block will be orphaned before it has had a chance to fully propagate. Orphaning due to propagation latency is a theoretical centralization pressure, one that increases mining profitability the closer to the rest of the other miners a given miner is.
While the effect is real and can be calculated, under current and foreseeable circumstances the impact is absolutely negligible. Mining profitability is absolutely dominated by electricity costs, hardware costs, physical infrastructure costs, and personnel costs. It's a simple argument though, and if Bitcoin were a 1-varabile system, it would be correct to base all decisions off of it.
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:27:56
They are probably referring to the concept of 'active supply'. It is assumed that about 4 million coins are lost and/or never coming back into circulation. That means current supply is acting as though it were about 13m coins, not 17m. This affects market cap, the inflation rate etc. Now, extend that thinking to coins that haven't been used in a 'while', we can see that it is actually a continuum, and not just 'lost' or 'not', when it comes to looking at supply.

Unfortunately, there are lots of people who don't know any better, who will see posts like I critiqued, and take it's flawed reasoning and conclusion - presented as a fact - as incontrovertible.
There are many ways the author of that comment could have introduced the information that four exchanges have backed out of the NY agreement, and even that they personally took that as an indication of declining support. That would be completely fair and reasonable. Yet they choose to project that fact as "proof it's [the NYA] support is dwindling". The didn't even qualify the statement as proof that support was declining *among the signatories*, although later they attempted to suggest that was all they meant by it.
Language like they used turns up the rhetoric, turns up the heat and passion, and is a source of divisiveness. The choice of words was not an accident, but points to an agenda. We all have agendas, that is fine, but the commenter's error was using pushing an agenda using faulty logic.

The ease or difficulty of 'storing' the commodity is largely beside the point.

You can't run Bitcoin miner with gas though.
When measuring efficiency, you have to be careful where you draw the 'box'; what are you considering and what are you excluding. Looking at just the device, ie a gas heater or electric heater, an electric heater is 100% efficient (or 99.99%) at converting the energy coming into it into heat in the interior space it is in. A gas heater might be 99.99% efficient if you ran it in a sealed room, but that wouldn't be too healthy. Just on the surface, it is clear the gas heater looses some of its heat in the exhaust stream, reducing the amount of heat the enters the room as a percentage of the total heat of combustion.
If you want to consider the sources of the energy that your heater is running on, such cost of production, delivery distance, etc., that is an very different type of 'efficiency' calculation.

As your post makes clear, proof of work can have a role to play outside of an attempt to keep the network 'decentralized'.  Even in the system you describe, where there are a handful of trusted signatories issuing blocks, adding some fairly substantial amount of proof of work to the chain would make back-editing very costly.  
Put another way: Proof of work can be beneficial even in a centralized system, as way to economically dissuade the centralized gatekeepers from abusing their position.

Just because these ideas have been kicking around for a while doesn't make them any less valuable.  I look forward to seeing what Gavin's implementation looks like.  Miners will only run the code if it makes them more profitable.  The way I see it, if there are undesirable centralization traits that arise from widespread use of such a system, the problem lies with Bitcoin and it's economic incentive structure.  It is to be expected that miners do what they can to be profitable.  It is basically they rock that Bitcoin - in its current form - is built upon.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:34:56
Lighting is needed and will be very important when it gets implemented.
Right now, the current incentive structure essentially does support RBF, but I can easily imagine the that structure morphing into one  that is slightly more complex.  For instance, miners could forge an agreement whereby there were strong incentives to go along with - to not replace - which ever of competing transactions was published first.  It could involve a weak block scheme, it could involve a miner reputation system.  In any case, I foresee more cooperation among miners, and that will enable traits that are not possible today.  Cooperation may mean more centralization of a certain sort, but it wouldn't have to be bad.  If the cooperation did begin to result in undesirable transaction censorship, another crypto would serve to fill the needs of whoever was being discriminated against.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:54:58
Bitcoin is open source. Anyone can make changes to the codebase and anyone can run whatever they want. Such changes will only have a material impact if they have a critical mass of support.

You say it is widely-known about event.  What makes you think knowledge of it is widespread?  Some anecdotal evidence to the contrary: I have plenty of friends who are slightly interested in Bitcoin and hold a coin or two, and most of them know nothing about the having schedule.
Among bitcoin holders, I'd say it is moderately-known about event.  Considering the world at large, it is essentially and unknown event.
I think the current price situation is reflective of a largely-static market view of risks and possible gains.  Of the $800k per-day average inflow needed to sustain current prices, a large piece of that is going to come from new entrants to the space.  Those people and companies need to hear about bitcoin, learn about, and become convinced it is a worthwhile place to put there money.  Ignoring the possibility of price-rise induced media frenzy, I think is not  unreasonable to assume the rate of new fiat coming into bitcoin will remain in the $800,000 per-day realm regardless of the daily coin supply.
My simple price model, therefore, suggests a doubling of the price after the daily coin supply gets halved.  There is also a decent chance that a doubling of price due to a change on the supply side will not leave the demand side unaffected: A rising price could easily attract attention and entice people to jump on the bandwagon. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:19:47
In general though, if miners run optimizations that make them more profitable, and somehow the optimizations are bad for Bitcoin, then Bitcoin has a problem that needs to be solved.  It doesn't really seem reasonable to blame the profit-maximizing optimizations when the whole thing is supposed to work on game-theory of miners trying to make money.

I agree that banks use some outdated legacy systems that make things slow, but I think there is another force at play that keeps things from being quick... the need for reversibility.  Many types of bank transactions take days to settle, which effectively limits the number of hops money can make in a month.  If someone discovers theft or fraud a week or month after it happened, the fact that the money could only have moved a limited number of times makes things easier for people to track and to unwind.

First I would like to say thanks for the great presentation the other day.  I did agree with many of your ideas, and some points of disagreement had as much to do with you being a more theoretical and abstract thinker than I am than with the underlying concepts.
As for the point I was trying to make above, what I should have said is that the cost of transactions are part of the cost of running a full node.  They are functionally inseparable since, generally speaking, one would have no reason to run a node if they were not a transacting participant on the network.  How often one would need to transact to feel enough of a participant to make running a node is debatable.  I would suggest something on the order of 1 transaction per week as reasonable minimum to work with under the Bitcoin network as it looks like today. If Bitcoin eventually becomes a sort of adjudication system to resolve disputed lighting-like contracts, perhaps something as little as 1 tx per month or year would be workable.
The appropriate way to calculate the cost of running a node should be: yearly computer cost including electricity +  bandwidth per year + minimum transaction cost per year = total cost per year

It seems clear to me that we should never sacrifice any of the soundness the Bitcoin currently enjoys. In comparison, we don't currently have anything close to 'unconditional privacy', and even if were achieved in a narrow mathematical sense, there are all of the meta-data type leaks that will also exist. Any improvements in privacy are welcome, provided the are practical. And even if we know the privacy providing crypto will be broken in the future - and allow for retroactive deanonymization - we shouldn't let that stop us from using the tech. 
Most crypto will be broken eventually, and all of our archived encrypted communications will some day be decrypted. But the longer we can keep our activities and communications private, the better.

Basic economics does not cover bitcoin mining.  There many competing factors.  As you seem to understand the ones that encourage large economies of scale, I point out a two that encourage mining to remain spread out.
1) Cheap power.  There is no one location with an infinity of the cheapest power.  There is some excess at one dam, and some more excess at another, and still more near a wind farm.  There are places like this all over the world.

If you are paying a company to buy something, then you are already parting with you money. It matters not what system *that* company is using to accept your Bitcoin, as that is strictly up to them.

If successfully deployed, it all but eliminates concerns that large blocks would lead to differences in propagation delays.  Such propagation delays, or differences really (among miners), are often cited as a factor that can add to centralization pressure for miners.  The concept being that bigger blocks would exacerbate bandwidth differences, penalizing miners with skinnier pipes, and leaving them with a higher orphan rate than they would if blocks were smaller.
Reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted upon block discovery to a single packet means that latency, and not bandwidth becomes the controlling factor.  If it takes 2000ms to push the packet globally, that would only put a miner at a 0.33% disadvantage vs a miner with an (impossible) 0ms delay. 
The aggregate amount of data that is transmitted would almost certainly be higher under a plan like this, as pre-block ‘coordination’ will be occurring, but the burstiness will be reduced.  As long as a miner has the minimum bandwidth required to not fall behind on the pre-building conversations, no extra bandwidth would be of benefit.
If you didn’t think that larger blocks were a good idea without a plan like this being implemented, this probably won’t change you mind.  However, it does decisively eliminate a frequently cited concern that some fear bigger blocks would worsen.

Trace makes a good point, but there is something important he is overlooking.  Bitcoin itself cannot guarantee that an individuals private wealth is 'sovereign' or protected, as wealth as it relates to money is dependent on other people choosing to value it.  Put another way:  The system can guarantee you remain the holder of some bitcoins, but it cannot guarantee that they are worth anything, for that depends on the free will of other individuals.
That characteristic of affording the individual massive power over their own financial assets is a huge, revolutionary concept that Bitcoin temps us with.  To reach that goal, however, entails creating a system that ordinary people find practical and useful.  Denigrating the importance of micro-payments is silly (I'm not saying they will be on chain, they will not!).
The irony is that if we just focus on Bitcoin being a tool for massive wealth transfers, it will never actually become that.

Proof of work does not guarantee decentralization. What it does prove is that someone, some entity, invested a demonstrable amount of money and electricity in creating the chunk of data - in this case a block - that presumably is of interest to you. It lets the user know the result they are seeing had some non-negligible cost to produce, and by extension, allows for confidence that they are looking at the same version of reality as everyone one else. If censorship resistant mining could be achieved by some other mechanism, I think the would sill be a benefit to seeing that the record had a cost to produce.

My favored solution is to redefine one "Bitcoin" as 1,000,000 Satoshis, instead of the current 100,000,000. The rational has two parts. It makes use of the powerful brand "Bitcoin".  Lets have the base unit be a usable amount and the most common name.  All in one. Such a change would be equivalent to a stock split, which is a commonly understood financial technique.

The Gemini event and the Bitstamp spike seem to stand a fair chance of being related.  It could be a bank or government testing the liquidity in the system.  You can look at the order books all day long, but doing actual large trades and watching how things equalize the best way to test to see if the liquidity as actually there.  Maybe they were doing a timing test to see how fast bots reacted, comping order books across exchanges before, during, and after the orders where placed.

I see some of your points, and can agree to disagree on others.  But I will take exception with one thing you have said (and you said it twice).
-The price has stayed fairly stagnant over the last year (and is in fact down 31% from exactly one year ago), which indicates flat or declining demand. I mean if all of these new people are "entering the space," who are they buying from?
-Again, I don't think this is so because the price does not seem to reflect an increase in demand.
This is the basis of what this thread is about, and what we are debating.  The fact you are not addressing here, is that supply is constantly increasing!  The people entering the space are buying, directly or indirectly, from miners.  If the price stays the same, the market cap will grow.  Yes the price is still down from the crazy days, but it has stopped declining for the most part, which to me indicates supply and demand are in rough equilibrium.  The rate of supply increase will soon slow by half. 
 Bitcoin should be the most elastic of all commodities, since what buyers should be desiring is not a fixed quantity, but rather the acquisition of a certain amount of value.  If that assumption were entirely true, it would support the price doubling.  Of course if people desire a fixed amount of bitcoin, say 1 coin, that would support more than a doubling of price.  I'm not saying it will actually double, I am just pointing out how one variable in the equation should be structured.
If we were talking about a stock where there were a fixed number of shares, you would be correct.

You are right, it is possible that every person on the planet uses bitcoin, but as you suggest, that is unlikely. There are about 2 Billon people who use the internet, so that is where I was getting the upper end of my range.  I don’t have a hard time imagining 1 billion users, but that’s just me.  Your guess is a good as mine (although I should note, you didn’t offer a guess).
I am no expert on the details of the efficient market hypothesis, but in the case of something like Bitcoin, you must find a way to account for the many millions of people on the sideline who are looking at the technology, who for one reason or another, have not yet choose to enter the market.  And everyday, hundreds to thousands of new participants enter the space.  So they do have something to do with the price, and they are coming from a pool that is not about to be exhausted anytime soon.
As for my estimates of how many people might know something about the having schedule, go ahead an knock them, but I can’t help but notice that even in your rebuttal of my approach, you didn’t hazard a guess yourself.
In my ‘numeric’ approach, I was trying to come with as generous a number a possible as to how many people might have a clue about the having.  I wasn’t excluding people who are already in the market.  So yes, my estimate was possibly 2 million people who could know about the having schedule.
Then I made another guess, based on my personal involvement in the bitcoin community, that 50,000 know of the having schedule.
I made an estimate and guess, 2,000,000 and 50,000 respectively, of people who are aware of the event we are discussing.  The closets thing to a guess you made, was “everyone”.  Again, I am no expert in the details of the efficient market hypothesis, but you are claiming the “market” is everyone who is a player.  Players do not include people who are considering buying?
-I'm assuming that just about anyone who deals with a substantial amount of bitcoin is savvy enough to know about the halving schedule; there's not exactly a lot of "layperson adoption" happening.
Every day, new people become savvy enough to know about the having schedule and to make large investments in the space.

I agree that POW alone is not sufficient to keep things decentralized, but avoiding costless simulation is an intrinsic benefit, as Hashcash made use of. This is more subjective, but it also is / was a great way to distribute coins. Maybe it wouldn't work so well at this point, if we were were starting over at 0 BTC, but hopefully we won't need to bootstrap again :)

I am sure many polls are poorly implemented. It would be easy enough to allow votes to come from the current bitcoin address, or the previous one. Obviously both would not be allowed to vote, and a vote from the current address would nullify a vote from the previous one, but that way cold storage wouldn't need to be compromised for the vote, provided the user had the private keys they used to send the funds into cold storage. If not, cold storage fund could be send to a new cold storage address, and the recently emptied keys could be used to sign the vote.

The limit of 21 million 'whole BTC' limit is arbitrary, and the price has scaled to meet that expectation, but in terms of total supply, the only arbitrary number that matters is the eventual 2.1 quadrillion total units. Currently, and for the foreseeable future, Bitcoin will have more than adequate granularity, but I would expect future people to 'move the decimal to the right' if lack of granularity ever became an issue.
I don't see the 10-mins / 1 MB as economically important, at least in the sense that anything has 'formed' around them, and it would not be disruptive to change them. Technically, maybe. And perhaps economically, but only in the sense that many people have planned for Bitcoin to be hamstrung by those values, and they have started building alternatives. To the extent that Bitcoin can unshackle itself, those alternatives will become less needed and less valuable.
As for induced demand, I mostly agree. Transaction volume will probably grow to almost whatever block space is provided, and awarding limited space via fee-auction is a great solution. However, 10MB blocks would still mean 10x more transactions. It's true that the economic exchange benefit would less than 10x, since presumably the most economically important transactions are the ones willing to pay the highest fees, so diminishing returns are in effect. I'll guess 5x - 8x the economic activity boost on 10x block size increase. However, if the value of a money follows a Metcalf's law, the increased rate of economic activity would need to be squared to yield the true benefit. So for a 10MB block, 5x would turn into 25x, which divided by 10 would be 2.5x increase in value of money / per block size unit. Those numbers are guesses, but there relationship is how I expect the system to respond.
Another take on it: I am not so concerned with lowering fees as I am with allowing for more outright economic activity to happen on chain. If Satoshi had picked 10MB blocks, eventually we would have the same fees, but the economic importance of the network would be between 10x more and 100x (metcalf) more than it is today. Absolute throughput matters. 
A slow+unreliable+expensive blockchain is thought by some to an inherent condition, but the mostly it comes down to fear of what an attacker might do. There only way to have a network that would resist any attack is to not have it exist at all. We are left to guess the motivations and means of an attacker. The network as it is now could not survive certain attacks (China + US collaboration would easily take over mining). This is well beyond engineering, and gets directly into Geo-politics, and what kind of network can best withstand state attacks. Reasonable opinions differ widely. 
My expectation is that Bitcoin will need to be somewhat less 'pure' than it's original vision to survive. Bitcoin needs to be big to have enough hash power to survive, and it can't be 'that big' without government blessing and bank-tie in. Let's say Ethereum works with corporations and governments and implements white lists and black lists and muti-sig international 'oversight' of some sort. Imagine far more sovereignty than PayPal / Banks, but less than Bitcoin. But for 99% of people it works very well. And then Bitcoin, used by ransomware, 'terrorists', etc. So the governments deem Bitcoin illegal, shut down the exchanges, etc.. It doesn't die, but the price falls and the hashrate drops, and then it becomes very, very easy to attack with the seized mining farms. I don't think we can win that war. I think we need to win the war of hearts and minds and economic importance, and most likely that will mean doing things along the way to appease the powers that be.

"General community consensus" is not objectively measurable. So far that term has been invoked as a pseudo-fact, and it has lead to endless gridlock and discussion because people either don't know what it means, or predictably disagree on the essence of it since it there is not agreed-upon metric.
And, who said anything about a few big holders? I am talking about all holders, their voice equal to their commitment to the system. Do you really think that someone who has $0.10 worth of BTC should have as much of a say in the direction of the protocol as someone who has trusted $1,000,000 of value to Bitcoin?

Indeed, 1MB is a lot closer to the ideal than 1GB.  But just to make clear, there is literally no one who is suggesting that the network could handle anything close to 1GB blocks today.  There are people who think the limit should be removed entirely, but that position can be best understood as "We think the miners will, collectively, make blocks of the ideal size".  It's a legitimate view point.  As Bitcoin security is based largely on a clever incentive structure, the "unbounded blocksize" perspective thinks that miners recognize Bitcoin's value as coming from it's decentralized, censorship resistant properties.  Part of that is decentralized mining, and part of that is the ability of full-nodes to continually do full audits of the blockchain.  If miners know this, and they do, they have an interest in preserving those proprieties to protect their own interests.
Personally, I tend to agree with those concepts.  I also have no issue with a blocksize cap of 4 - 8 MB in the sort term, and 16 - 32 MB in the 'few years away' time frame.  We need to give the network the ability to keep growing as we wait for Lightning, Bitcoin NG and sidechains to provide massive scaleability .

Thanks! I wrote it just before going to sleep :)
Regarding full nodes, my hope is that they stay within the realm of affordability for a hobbyist or engaged user, who is they type of person that we would expect to run a full node. Let's not forget that being your own bank isn't easy to do safely, and it is probably better if grandpa leaves protecting his private keys to someone else. If a full node cost less than a few hundred dollars to purchase, and less than $100 per year to operate, it will be within financial reach of many hundreds of millions of people. A used i5 laptop, with a 4TB external drive, would be able to keep 8 years of chain at 10MB blocks, and that setup can currently be had for $200. And that's the ideal of an dedicated, standalone, full node. As for bandwidth requirements, the only bandwidth that is necessary from a self-interested user's perspective is downloading the main chain once. A full node doesn't even need to keep a mempool, nor does it need to serve out data to anyone else. Full 'sovereignty' can be achieved by holding private keys and checking blocks after they are issued. It should be expected that people will have to pay for block data from 'relay' nodes. Why should anyone be expected to upload data for free?


That is *one* variable in the security and decentralization equation. Another two are the absolute number of users and nodes. Which is more decentralized: A network with 1 million users at 1% full node coverage for 10k full nodes, or a network with 1 billion users at 0.1% full node coverage, for a total of 1 million nodes? I will side with whatever gives the highest absolute number of nodes. To that end, I would like to onboard more users, by allowing for more *current* use cases. I think a larger network, with more nodes, more users, higher hashpower, and a higher token value will result in more security.
By the way, consensus was not reached by the community at large. Bitcoin Core has come to represent a certain ideological position, and most people who disagree don't feel welcome there. Whether they are in fact welcome or not is a separate question, but since they don't *feel* welcome, they have left. Consensus is easy to reach in a group that has a similar vision, but Bitcoin is far broader than that group. Clearly we are where we are today because there was never a consensus that raising the block size was not the way forward. No consensus was reached on anything, for that matter, including a decision to raise the blocksize, or even if consensus was needed to make changes to the network.
Of course if blocks are too large, at some point people would find Bitcoin impractical or too expensive too run. 100MB blocks today? No. That would be 5.5 TB per year, which would clearly strain typical broadband limits, storage space, and take too long to sync. But 8 or 10MB would be easily handled by typical home-user computer setups.
Another quick thought: If we raised the blocksize to 8MB and transaction fees didn't drop much, that would be a raging success for Bitcoin. We can't promise to do whatever it takes to get $0.15 transactions, that might be impossible. And if transactions were stable at $0.15, I doubt there would be much of a push to raise the limit. But since fees are high AND many people feel it well within Bitcoin's technological capacity to raise the limits, say to 4MB or 8MB, that combination is why there is such a strong push.


I really don't think their objective is to degrade security and increase centralization. I can visualize their actions resulting in more security and decentralization, so that allows me to continue to assume good intentions.




I hope we can just split as amicably as possible. I would keep coins on both networks after a fork. I am worried that the "cypherpunk side" wants to hold onto resources that would prefer to be on the "bank side". If the SHA256 miners want to mine the mainstream coin, they should. If the exchanges and banks all want to support the mainstream one, they should. I think all that is really left over to fight about will be the name "Bitcoin". I think the mainstream side will hunger for the brand more than the cypherpunk side, since branding is very important for mass adoption. But I expect that to be a very contentious sticking point, and that is supported by much of the history of this debate, far too much of which has hung on semantics.

You can play with semantics all you want, but it is entirely possible to design a system where the total amount of votes cast are equal to the number of coins in existence. I'd be willing to place an escrowed bet that such a system is possible, and I could specify it myself it that was needed to win the bet.
You can check your addresses right now and see if you have any of Lazlo's pizza coins, or any of the U.S. Marshal's seized Silk Road coins. If there was an open-ended vote were coins could only vote once and only once at anytime in Bitcoin's existence, and Lazlo had used those 10k BTC to sign a vote, you could check your addresses today and, using taint analysis, see what percentage of your fund Lazlo had previously used to vote with. At a minimum, you would not be able to use that percentage of your balance to give weight to your vote.

Mining is centralized. Block sizes could be 100 bytes and mining would still be centralized.  It is centralized because of access to cheap electricity, cheap hardware, cheap labor, and economies of scale.

As if that is some sort of treason. People should run whatever code they please.  Furthermore, you seem to be thinking that a mono-culture code will be the strongest, although there are several significant weaknesses with that concept. One is the risk of a technical mistake, which could result in an unintentional fork (and a near 50/50 split of hash power is always possible), or could result in something worse if there is a flaw in the cryptography implementation. The second risk is that of having the entire bitcoin system be subject to centralized development, which is exactly the situation we are struggling with today. Let's set aside how we may feel about the current Core developers. Control of the github repo is controlled by one person (or two or three?). It's not unreasonable to think a single repo could become corrupted. How should the ecosystem at large coordinate switching to new software? It would be a very precarious situation, as is the case currently (again, I'm not commenting on if Core is doing a good job or not).
Right now the 'code is the spec', and that is a terrible position for Bitcoin to be in. It would be a far more resilient system, both technically and politically for there to be 5 or 10 implementations, that together, through there common overlap, define Bitcoin.

I don't know why you think that they would be tricked. SPV wallets are designed to follow the chain with the most work, or to abide by the policies of the full node that is supporting them.

Interesting situation. I would tend to think of it more as what they said you couldn't do, which is ride in their car again. They prevented you from doing something that was well within their right. I suppose you could say they 'forced you to not ride with them'. And yes, you could probably say they 'forced you to find an alternative means' of accomplishing your goal. Forcing someone to do something specific, and forcing someone to 'not do a specific thing' or 'forcing them to find an alternative' are very different concepts. I don't think it is informative to try to connect them by suggesting that they both involve 'force'.
It would be similar to your example if I went to a store to by a can of Coke, and they told me the Coke they had was already reserved and they wouldn't sell it to me. Following your line of reasoning, the store 'forced me to choose a different drink', or 'forced me to choose a different course of action'. I don't find it conceptually helpful to think along those lines.

Censorship resistance ≠ censorship proof. No one who supports Bitcoin wants it to become a 'crummy version of paypal'. What if was a far, far better version of paypal though? 
Personally I think that the vast majority of humans desire some form of governance, including of their money system. Some hard-core bitcoiners will argue that any governance is imperfect and can be corrupted, and we should strive for 'no governance', and 'individual sovereignty', but these concepts are just illusions, impossible to achieve in the context of a fiat money system.
We would be better served by acknowledging the inevitability (and desirability) of governance, and coming up with the best forms of it we can.

On the second point: What can be enforced is that each coin only gets to vote once. If I vote with my coins, and you choose not vote, and then we swap coins, I could potentially vote with your coins as well. It is a level playing field, however, and the maximum number of votes is capped as well.

There are code forks, as mentioned above, and there are chain forks. Some code forks result in chain forks.
A chain fork with very little economic or hash power to support it isn't much of a consideration for Bitcoin users, but a chain fork (a hard fork) that gains substantial economic and hash power support would make a strong claim for the title "Bitcoin". The original chain could grind to a halt and loose almost all value.

Just because Bitcoin currently does have these characteristics does not mean they are inherently necessary in order to have robust security and decentralization. In fact, Bitcoin is currently not even decentralized at the mining level. And with no formal spec, there isn't criteria by which we can evaluate how well it is fulfilling its security goals.
And even if there exits ways to maintain Bitcoin's essential properties while making it faster, cheaper, and more reliable, but they are not know yet, that doesn't mean they are not possible.

I don't disagree, but I would like to point out that in life, there can be great rewards and opportunities for people who develop expertise and confidence, and are willing to shoulder the burdens and joys of true responsibility. And all else being equal, it will be harder for someone to become wealthy if they don't have the interest or confidence to secure their assets.

In the end, the exchanges would be reduced to buying BTC on the open market, since there isn't an option to print BTC to cover losses, as exists with fiat. Of course printing fiat to cover banking failures is just spreading those losses around over all holders of the currency. I tend to think that makes banks (and customers) sloppier, and more causal with security. Whenever there are new articles about massive fiat thefts, or even natural disasters, or really ANY large event that I suspect is the type of thing untimely backed by fiat-printing, it makes me grateful that I have options to store value (such as Bitcoin) that are not diluted as a result. I personally don't mind contributing resources to many public endeavors, but footing the bill for repeated bailouts, often due to gross incompetence, is frustrating.

- Larger blocks will always lead to more centralization.
Absolute statements like this not only are incorrect, but they help to polarize the debate.  There is a balance that needs to be struck.  Tadge Dryja gave a nice 'bathtub' explanation at the Montreal scaling conference.  Blocks that either too big or too small will have centralizing effects.

That dichotomy is plainly false.
Money is a shared, social system. If the network did a soft-fork and everyone decided to not accept your coins, you might think your funds had been frozen, but in reality it was just that no one wanted to accept them. That would be governance they all choose for themselves, yet you might feel the effects more strongly than anyone else.

Sure the premium would fall, but the value of BTC could easily rise more than 40% at the same time, so I'd guess the ticker price would rise.

10-cent fees are not the issue.  The problem is there is no widespread agreement about what fees 'should' be.  Some people think 10-cents is too high, others would be happy to see fees at $20 for a tx.  My opinion is something around 10 - 20 cents equivalent would be a good balance between not choking off legitimate growth, limiting spam, and generating rewards for the miners.  I'd like to see 32-MB blocks in a few years time, which would be 8-million tx per day (not considering SegWit here).  At 12 cents per tx, that's a million per day in fees, which buys plenty of electricity for hashing.  And 8-million tx per day would give us lots and lots of room to grown when combined with lighting.  This is not L1 vs L2, as are both needed.  At this stage of where the technology is at, there is effectively a multiplier effect when going to L2 tx, which varies depending on the nature of the L2 tech being used.  Suppose for lightning it is 20x, meaning on average there are 20 Lightning tx before someone wants to tie it back to the L1 chain.  8 * 20 would 160-million tx per day (for 32-MB blocks).  Time will tell exactly what the actual multipliers are, and they will change as the tech matures.  But for now, while it is key to develop the L2 systems for many reasons, we shouldn't make the mistake of over-estimating how high their multiplier effect will be, for if we do, we will find those very L2 services we worked so had to develop hobbled by the lack of L1 access.

Not exactly. Holders set the upper limit of the bull markets... when they stop holding. The price floor in the bear markets is set by the flow of fiat in to buy up the steady supply of newly mined coins. Holders are not fiat rich... it's not their fiat that is setting the floor, at least not when $6 million per day is needed to maintain the price.

- Well, according to the efficient markets hypothesis (which, again, is imperfect but often useful), the present value of the anticipated increase in the value of bitcoin after the halving is what is and always has been priced in.
and 
- ...a sudden change in value that's attributable to the event everyone knew was coming.
Everyone must include everyone who could be a player in the bitcoin marketplace.  Those people easily number between 1 - 2 billion.  At most 5% will know that bitcoin is some kind of "internet money".  Of that set, probably no more than 2% knows of the having schedule.  That would suggest that only 1 / 1000 people who could be part of the demand for bitcoin know about the impending reduction in supply.  Thinking of absolute numbers, I'd bet less (and probably far less) than 50,000 people know about the having schedule and that about 70% of the supply has been released.
The idea that "everyone knew" about this a flawed assumption, and as a result the efficient market hypotheses does not apply.  A key variable is the rate at which new participants discover bitcoin and decide it is worth their time and money to invest.  Any accurate model must account for the daily influx of new interest and money, and any model that does will be much more likely to show a price rise when the daily influx of new coins get cut in half.

That was possible because the network used to have very little transaction volume.  I desperately want to see larger blocks today, something between 2 and 4 MB, and hopefully 32 MB within 4 years.  However, lightning and other such technologies will be necessary for the 'cup of coffee' purchase.

No. Mixing only serves to obfuscate the relationship of coins to a human / computer / ip / etc. No amount of mixing would allow a 'coin' to vote twice.


Do you think it would be a better system if people with no holdings in Bitcoin had say in the direction of the network equal to people who have significant wealth they choose to hold in BTC?


And who is counting the votes? Who decides how the opinions translate into the network behavior? You probably agree with the 'general consensus' or 'rough consensus' concept. There is individual sovereignty, there is voting (which could be one-per-person or individual), and there are systems with small groups or single people in control. Money is a social system at its heart, and Bitcoin faces that inescapable fact with the 'majority of honest miners' caveat. Holders are a proxy for miners. They are in partnership with the miners. If you buy and hold coins, you are helping to finance the miners' operations. That is why the opinion of holders are ultimately as important the hash-power of miners, and doing a coin-weighted vote is a lower-friction way of communicating intent than is leaving for another chain.

That is not how it works. Miners are incentivized to consume energy in proportion to the VALUE of the Bitcoins mined, not the absolute number. If the price is $50,000 / BTC in 5 years, the total value of Bitcoins mined per block would be 2.5x higher than today, and energy consumption would be expected to be similarly higher.

If there were 5 different code bases, each with 20% of mining power behind them, and each attempting to meet a well defined spec for the consensus rules, yes, occasionally one implementation would have an error and there would be a fork. With properly designed controls, however, the only losses would be for the miners how mined blocks on the forked and soon-to-orphaned spur. It would be trivial to detect what had happened. 
If you think that temporary forks are catastrophic, I can understand what multiple implementations looks like a bad idea. A system designed to handle accidental forks smoothly, however, is far more robust than one that cannot. Moving away from the status quo is the most difficult part.

It could impact bitcoin because it will compete for the sha256 hash power. In the chance that BCC tokens become more valuable than bitcoin tokens, we could see BCC become the most secure blockchain, to the detriment of the security of the original chain.

Bitcoin provides tools for people to truly take control of their own financial destiny, or, at least a big part of it. And those tools are getting better, easier, safer, and more reliable as the years go by. But it will always be true that many people will not want to take personal responsibility for their own affairs. They want some else to reassure them, and someone else to blame if things go wrong (and hopefully to make it right again). All of that comes at a cost though. Some it measurable in a percentage of fees and premiums and inflation, while the rest is less tangible, but no less significant. The loss of privacy. The loss of autonomy. The loss of agency. It is very hard to "get ahead" when you are just following someone else.
*edit -  Many people truly do not need or want what Bitcoin offers, as they are content forever being a little part of a big machine. It is okay to not be ambitious.

Keep in mind if the larger economic situation is kept equal, which for the past year has meant (very roughly) and average of about $10 million dollars per day of new dollars coming into bitcoin to absorb the mining rewards, the price would "double" if that same amount of money chases only half as many new coins per day.
That number - the new capital inflow - is what miners are competing for, and is probably the dominant factor in the price when the market gets quiet (which is typically in the depths of a bear market).

One Bitcoin, but it is certainly possible to have two long lasting forks. In that case, hopefully they can pursue different visions in peaceful co-existence. I plan on keep my coins on both chains for a while. I don't want to roll the dice.

Bitcoin is NOT currently good for sending small transactions with low fees. If you want to transfer anything below $100 worth of value, it would make sense to use another chain or a trusted third party, off-chain solution.
Minimum fees are $1-$2 right now if you want to have a tx confirmed.

I currently have laptop that I bought, used, for $150, that I use as my dedicated bitcoin full node. i5 processor, 8GB ram, 500GB hard drive, running Ubuntu.
If blocks are 8MB, and the chain is 1TB in size, I would buy a 4TB internal drive for $125. My 200MB connection would download the data in 10 hours under perfect conditions, although I would assume the process would take several days under real-world conditions. My ISP does have a 1 TB monthly cap, although they give a couple 'free months' per year to exceed the cap. i could also pay extra for the extra data, or download the chain in between billing periods, to split the data. Or use some other, truly unlimited connection for the initial download.
I would expect the rise in the price of bitcoin to more than compensate for the additional costs of running a node that larger blocks would incur.
