@_date: 2017-12-19 21:37:30
Same. I just look at BCH price and say, wow, I'm glad I have some of that!. 
I look at BTC and think, wow, I'm glad I have that!
I see Gold and say, wow how is this still around? I'm glad I have some of that, tho!
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:26:11
Oh gotcha. Mostly no. They do not. Sometimes you might get lucky, but 99% of the time it's a losing proposition. They are not an investment.

Wow these are a joke...

That's probably the correct answer.

@_date: 2018-05-31 13:28:51
My layman understanding which may be wrong - please correct me!
The amount of energy required to mine coins is related to the hashrate put in to do so. If not enough people mine to keep the approximately 10 minutes between blocks, the difficulty to do so can be decreased.
Basically, the energy required is simply based on the fact that people want the block rewards/fees and compete with energy to have the highest chance to find the block?

nothing wrong with that. My first foray in to bitcoin was internet drugs. My next was CS:GO skins. If I had kept some of the original change from my earliest purchases I'd have a lot of money. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 03:21:02
fascinating. 
But also why memes are popular.

I think 3k is reasonable and sorta likely. I don't daytrade tho so don't really care. The lower it goes the more I get when my weekly buy happens
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:52:03
That's my first time seeing it and it's really tacky
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:32:48
If you can afford to lose it all and 6k is nbd, yeah sure. Just keep in mind you don't need to buy an entire coin. Any percent can be bought.
@_date: 2018-10-24 16:04:50
I use it for bovada, which it works well for. Also I've bought a pair of glasses from a local shop. It went smoothly for that as well.

Yes also. However there's better explanations on how to do so than I can provide.

You responded to a 2 sentence post to rant like 1000 words of white supremacist great replacement bullshit. Maybe go outside and play between classes instead of reading old debunked bell curve nonsense.
Also maybe actually read the CNN article you posted it directly contradicts your interpretation of it. Or do you just not believe them cuz it's not racist enough for you.
Fuckin kids, man.
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:16:16
It's fun, I think that's the only reason. The matching up to this point is curious and God damn if it's not a chart I'd love to see.

I use bitcoin to fund &amp; pay out on gambling websites. I also use it to pay my drug dealer, though he's local and we still often use cash. I've used it a couple times to donate to various freeware and SMB romhack creators. So some of us use it.

I thought it was an interesting article, at least in the sense that it's a concept I haven't seen/heard before. Perhaps I may have missed previous attempts at this sort of idea, as I don't pay THAT much attention to the analysis of this.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:02:40

Not really. I'm confident Bitcoin will continue growth and eventually, *eventually* begin to break fiat currency's hold on transactions. But not due to a low effort chart analysis.

Trading CS:GO skins got me in to bitcoin. Folks come from all over the internet to get here.

What is "sell"?
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:20:41
I originally got in by buying off a friend. Also how I got others interested when I sent them small amount. Do you know anyone with a bunch who would sell you some?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:06:57
Worried about where you're going to get money to buy the dip?
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:08:10
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:03:17
Thanks! Any recommendation besides bread?
thanks again

I fund my bovada account with BTC. Great site.

I was just making a cheeky reference to the meme. I'm not taking financial advice from redditors

don't know. Same happened for me on mobile, but not on desktop. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:54:41
I have $520 what do I do?
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:37:17
to be fair, this is literally showing a use case for LN, especially if you consider on a larger scale... so, like, LOL, but also, hey maybe this could be something?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:45:28
FYI I used bitskins to sell some knives it worked nice. Technically you're always "going first" by trading to the site but it's better than some rando. 
Edit: they take 5% but it was worth it for the convenience.
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:22:42
I mean, that'd be cool for a lot of people, but... that's only 20%. I most certainly wouldn't bet on that.

I hate looking at the price after I buy. I never sell, but why oh why do I keep buying?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:31:05
Yes. It's still early tech/adoption-wise and it's obviously not for you. Yet
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:22:40
Why are you here? Are you mad at people who made like 200% profit in a month?
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:29:05
I'm not much of a car guy, so I guess I could just store my bikes in a lambo.  Or lock them to a lambo tractor. So many choices.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:00:34
And I'll be buying. Hoping for sub 1k before Aug 1. Then moon.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:26:04
Not sure. Today ended up being boring as hell. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:52:21
Dude. You're legit retarded. You're going through comment history and attempting to insult me by saying I'm a lady. I'm embarrassed for you
