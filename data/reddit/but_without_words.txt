i've said it before, but it bears repeating in this context:
bitcoin's progression is fundamentally about disintermediation, and the progression of a business is fundamentally about entrenching its role as an intermediary. businesses only create value as a price-of-entry into a position which they will then seek to dominate. for this reason businesses will inevitably have an adversarial relation to the progress of bitcoin technology.
this is why giving power to businesses in shaping the course of bitcoins development is deeply misguided.

"However, without segwit or another malleability fix, LN channels have to deal with situations where transactions get mutated ("malleated"), which makes them get stuck at various steps. Preventing them from getting stuck permanently requires either introducing trust (which we don't want to do) or setting some annoying timeouts that limit the efficiency of channels."

according to this, mars moves between being 3.03 and 22.4 light minutes away from earth:
i wonder whether the colony will start its own local chain, or just accept the additional round trip time waiting for any confirmations.
i suppose in theory mars could eventually compete to be the centre of mining.

a group of people could build a machine which generates a private key and also physicalises it.
this group of people could stake their reputation on this by committing their own funds in a multi-signature scheme with the public address of the generated private key.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:07:02
to begin, making the mistake of signing the nya is a negative indicator.
worse, failing to realise you've made a mistake during the protracted debate leading up to the cancelation of 2x is an *extremely* negative indicator.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:51:49
yes, a rushed and naive solution is a mistake. did you notice that the 2x fork actually stalled due to poor engineering? anyone who sided with this mistake should be utterly embarrassed.
how is playing out some business-cultural expectation like "don't renege on a promise" in any way relevant to doing solid engineering on a cryptographic service?
bitcoin is not a business. in fact, bitcoin is anti-business, in that the progression of this technology is fundamentally about disintermediation, whereas businesses are fundamentally about entrenching their role as intermediaries.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:44:47
they would be moving coins around a closed circuit of the addresses they control, while missing out on gaining new coins from honest transactors.
yes, they can still drive the price up, but as along as there is a limit to how many transactions they can fit into a block, they can't set the fees arbitrarily high before they start discouraging use of the chain they are mining.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:33:27


can anyone expand on this?
does this concern the possibility of unnoticed inflation in the event of a cryptographic break?

how is lightning relevant?
@_date: 2019-03-18 10:32:15
as far as i understand, nodes in the bitcoin network don't have identities, and the network doesn't rely on a one-person-one-node policy or something to that effect.
are you suggesting something like distorting the perceived mempool fee distribution by surrounding a victim with nodes spamming transactions with inflated fees? those transactions would still have to be legitimate, so that attack is economically infeasible.

"Alex" is a reference to Alex Trebek, from Jeopardy. Imitating the format of Jeopardy, u/Marcion_Sinope is suggesting that the fundamental ethos of Bitcoin is undermined by developing an affinity with Wall Street.

the mempool has repeatedly emptied in the last 24 hours.
also, the capacity decline is due to LNBig pulling some of their large capacity offline.

lightning channels are not chain based. they are based on trust-less channels in which a balance between parties can be updated.
the trade off is having to monitor the settlement chain. this can be outsourced to a third-party and incentivised with a fee.

it's a significant acknowledgement of bitcoin as a currency, unit of account.

the productive output of mining isn't in the hash of blocks (the "magical numbers with x zeros" in the front).
the productive output is in formulating a block which hashes to a value with the necessary run of zeros. this is productive in that it evidences the overall network effort (proof of work) to extend the chain.
(to be really clear, it isn't about a run of zeros either, just that the hash value be below the chains current difficulty level)
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:35:53
i spend an inordinate amount of energy following bitcoins development and the blockchain space in general, and in my humble and very biased opinion the people contributing to bitcoin/lightning are the sharpest and most honest minds available.
it seems vastly more likely to me that bitcoin will evolve, as it has over the last 10 years (!!!), rather than losing relevance.
i'm not sure anyone can offer you more than this, except that you could make the effort to laboriously arrive at your own humble and very biased opinion.
there may be no short cuts.


lightning has already deeply impressed and delighted me, just from playing on satoshis.place and some random casinos. the UX is progressing and moving at a reasonable pace.

i've been using eclair for a week. it's very straightforward if you're already comfortable sending btc to an address via mainnet.
the major draw back with eclair is that you can only spend btc in a channel. receiving would produce a channel state that requires your monitoring, and it's difficult to guarantee that with a mobile app. this is something i expect will be solved, perhaps via watchtowers?
so far i haven't encountered that many cases where i really needed the receive functionality. the one exception being spare satoshi i'd rather have withdrawn from a lightning casino.
the main positives are: that the payments are confirmed within seconds, often seemingly instantaneously;
the transactions always succeed; the amounts can be truly miniscule.
@_date: 2019-01-10 03:45:04
they certainly want it, at certain prices ��
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:55:44
what's wrong with 2x is that the only thing motivating it are business-culture notions of how the world should be run, which is exactly what satoshi was reacting against in creating bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:51:06
i find this argument extremely unconvincing.
the "agreement" was cut in some closed door backroom meeting. where is the integrity in that?
moreover, where was the integrity in forking off bch? that already amounts to a violation of one sides "end of the deal".
above all, bitcoin is about putting solid engineering far ahead of cultural notions like business agreements.
if anything your argument further convinces me 2x is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:57:06
it sounds entirely unreasonable to me that a group of non-engineers should dictate a significant and dangerous event like a block size increase.
moreover hardforking shouldn't happen for one-off upgrades unless they are absolutely critical to fix an issue. there are a number of worthy changes and those should be prepared and applied in a single move.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:30:45
it's not enough for the developers to upgrade the client. the client has to be rolled out and adopted widely to prevent a disastrous forking. it requires consensus that this upgrade is a good idea and clearly that's not the case.

no, markets can be distorted by misinformation, and so "left to the markets" we may not end up with the best possible implementation of bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-28 22:39:23


my critical mind sees no arguments for the necessity of 2x at this point beyond some business-cultural notions of sticking to a backroom closed-door agreement.


i.e., it terrifies them deeply that bitcoin could succeed purely through engineering thinking. that would reveal the parasitic nature of the corporate world which they want to believe in.

Barry Silbert's silence is deafening. when last did he make a statement on this contentious fork?
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:14:08
if no one knows the private key of this "wrong address", then yeah i can imagine that being useful. if it's someone else's address, they would race you to move it one address further, finalising the reversibility.
i think you'd want to implement this in clients rather than changing bitcoin directly.

just to be clear, are you anticipating a price approaching 200000 usd then?
using current values i quickly googled,
(gold mcap / 2) / supply =
(~7 trillion usd / 2) / 17,725,262 = ~197458.29427 ~= 200000 usd
that should be adjusted down a bit since the supply increases by the time the halvening arrives.
