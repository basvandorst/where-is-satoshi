It's almost as if there are different people with different opinions!
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:55:12
Huh, these are surprisingly low numbers, thanks for the information.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:45:20
Don't worry, I am not planning to :)
I am just curious... for example if I try to send 1 BTC through a node that only has 0.5 BTC in it... it can relay my payment I guess. I know LN is meant to be micropayments, but I hope the software/wallet will be smart enough to present the user with the message, that the amount of BTC is too high for the network/node instead of sending it into oblivion.
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:23:57
How is that? Don't you just scan the Barcode?
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:02:07
but when?
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:08:51
Everyone in the supply chain can tamper with the trezor.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:16:36
My Wallet doesn't support Segwit. It won't help much anyway once everyone uses Segwit, the capacity increase through Segwit is rather small (was it 30%?).
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:05:29
Did you rebroadcast it? It might have been forgotten by the mempool after 5 weeks, google "rebroadcast bitcoin transaction" to find out how to do that.
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:56:26


@_date: 2018-01-22 14:03:03
Is that a current data set from the network, or are these hardwired limits? Where can I read those?
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:21:34
Nope. I don't have to. 
If I want a Trezor I have no other choice but to trust Trezor. I don't need to trust anyone else on top of that.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:13:39


Not likely. 
I really don't see a benefit here for the network. It doesn't matter if we have 1000 nodes or 9999999 nodes - there is no significant difference. If we only had 100 nodes I would agree that more are better
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:16:11
You believe that there are bad actors who are to blame for the congested network. You are having a hypothesis. You are supposed to back that up with data. Can you?
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:26:32
And how much capacity increase does Segwit bring?
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:11:55
Doesn't mean it's safe. I could get virtually anything that LOOKS like a Trezor, but steals all my BTC. No thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:35:29
What happens if I create a node with 3 BTC in it and send 1.5 BTC to some other node? Can the network take it? Because every single connection right now has much less BTC in it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:25:12
But if there are thousands of nodes already, it does not add any value if I run another node, right?
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:01:02
Your points may be valid for very big blocksize increases, but if 1 MB worked in 2009, 2 MB will work in 2018. Internet speed, HDD space and pretty much every metric that is relevant has at least quadrupled in that time for the average computer. 1 MB was an arbitrary number set by Satoshi, a best guess. No reason to against going to 2 MB right now. 
All your points MIGHT get real if the blocksize is increased A LOT - but they are still pretty much insignificant compared to the fact that right now only a minority of users can acutally use Bitcoin. Nobody cares if tomorrow there are a few nodes less, and mining is centralized a lot already. We mainly see really huge pools with dedicated hardware and there is no going back anyway, mining for the layman has been dead for years, this is not new. So if mining will not really change, and the relevant situation about nodes won't change... we should just do it and relieve a huge amount of pain right now until we figure out LN. We have to increase blocksize for LN anyway later (have you read the whitepaper?), so we can do it right now while we really need it. If you believe LN is going to come tomorrow, think again and check out [this tweet from the project lead from 2015]( LN was supposed to be there 2,5 years ago, so I won't hold my breath.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:56:59
People using BTC = Attack. Got it.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:21:34


You are eating your own propaganda unfortunately. If 1 mb blocksize was OK in 2010 - why are 2 MB not OK in 2018? 8 Years in the computer world is like 2 lifetimes. In 2010 most people still had 2 mbit internet and stuff like movies, games and websites were extremely small and lightweight. Today everyone has 50 mbit and more, streams in 1080p or 4K and plays videogames that weigh 50 GB a piece. Running a node with 2 mb blocks would be easy. There are no technical reasons why a jump from 1 to 2 mb would lead to centralization.


Easy answer: Because BTC is the oldest. It is safe, yes, but it is also nearly unusable for its purpose: Sending money. If BTC keeps stagnating, others WILL take BTCs place. Increasing the blocksize will NOT make BTC any less safe.
I am all for LN, but let's not kid ourself: It will still be at least many months or a year until that has rolled out.


It's not that. According to the [Lightning Network Whitepaper]( a blocksize increase for LN is needed anyway. We could get that out of the way while we have the time and the need for it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:33:27
Exactly, ETH went way higher than BTC:

Oh, you mean the upstream supply chain. Yes, of course, I need to trust Trezor to take care of that part. But every additional link in the supply chain downstream from Trezor is unnecessary risk.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:31:39
Since the devs have been very silent about that topic in recent months, I think there have not been enough threads about it. Something needs to be done and right now, nothing is even *planned or talked about* by the devs.

Ouch. We have been waiting for LN *that* long? I was not aware.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:29:29
I'm with you, but Core has told their propaganda for too long - they can't turn around now and say "Hey you know what? A blocksize increase IS a good idea after all!". It would be true, but it would stand against all the lies they have spread in the past to fight "the bad guys".

@_date: 2017-11-21 13:41:17
Only if it is technically possible and BTC is BETTER than the alternative. Right now, you can't do enough transactions for many people. Transactions are also very expensive right now. That kills many many use cases.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:02:47
The cost of spam is calculated by multiplying the (number of transactions) by (the fee one transaction costs). If you increase the possible transactions by 2, you increase the cost of spam by 2. That would make it much more expensive to spam the network.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:23:52
Don't let your own low expectations hold up a discussion, there are people here with higher expectations and better use cases.

@_date: 2017-11-09 20:38:38
People are lazy. And because people are lazy, they buy stuff with their credit cards and not with high-fee BTC. But people would use BTC for dollar things if fees were lower. That would make BTC even more attractive for many people and it would again gain in market share.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:33:21
Why would I? Let's improve BTC and quit whining about why we can't do it.

@_date: 2017-11-07 08:48:07


That is a non argument, if the blocksize was increased we could have more low fee transactions. It doesn't have to be like it is today. if we had twice the capacity, fees would definitely go down significantly.

They don't really have to code anything if someone wants to fork, so I really don't understand where time was wasted.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:39:21
Does it matter? Nodes are pretty meaningless because of exactly this: You can just run some nodes on some servers and they are as good as any.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:34:52
I meant that it doesn't really matter who runs the nodes. Users, Amazon, some other server farm... it's all the same to the network. So if 2x has 90% amazon nodes, so be it. People here make it seem like that is a bad thing, but the protocol does not care about the physical location of a node and who owns it. Nodes can be spun up very cheaply, there is no real scarcity of the resource. Nodes and the origin of nodes are way overrated in this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:55:48
Yeah, really. Why do we have to choose? If Bitcoin has more utility, it will be used by more people and it will continue to grow. This is 2017, we can evolve Bitcoin. Most people agree that we can increase blocksize a little more and in a few years we will have LN. If we don't improve Bitcoin, at some point it will be orvertaken by Altcoins who are willing to adapt.
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:02:55
What keeps competitors (Altcoins, Visa etc..) from doing the same for years? It would be naive to believe that all the spam came only from "within" the Bitcoin community. It's too cheap and too easy to spam because Bitcoin's transaction capacity is terrible right now.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:20:44
You can increase blocksize by 2 and it will still be cheap to run a node. Look at your watch, it's 2017. The 1MB limit is nearly a decade old. If you say it is a problem without proving it, you are just hindering progress. You quote science, but where is it?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:03:22
Is that a dev job? I am not sure about that...
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:56:22
I could tell you the same. Pretty useless comment from you... like always.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:52:11
I agree that decentralization is important. Since even I could spin up a few nodes without really investing a lot of money, I see that as a moot point. If we would ever feel that we need more decentralized nodes, we could just run some. They are extremely cheap because bandwith and disc space needs are nothing out of the ordinary.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:52:59
I don't really want to argue about S2x right now, that is too hot for me - but raising the blocksize is definitely necessary if we look at the fees and how full blocks are right now. Since there is no REAL reason not to do it, it's pretty much a nobrainer. I just hope it happens in the near future, one way or another.

That is true right now, but since it hurts their business they will change that in the future. They are working on segwit implementation so I am pretty confident that they will reduce fees in the future. They are literally losing a lot of money there.

Segwit has nothing to do with that, the 20% segwit transactions today don't really make a difference. Segwit saves only a little bit of space per transaction.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:16:05
We only have Segwit today because of Segwit2x. Before Segwit2x, no side could win - some wanted Segwit, some 2x. Segwit2x is the compromise that first brought us Segwit, and will soon bring us 2x.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:51:38
I've been here since 2011. How about you? Did you read the link? I guess it's too complicated for you, so I copied it for you:


A Bitcoin transaction can have multiple outputs, and can thus transfer funds to multiple recipients, a practice also referred to as payment batching. Since an output can only spent in its entirety, one of these outputs is usually (but not always) a so-called change output, transferring the change back to the sender.




Pretending that usage is UP is just lying to yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:43:09
Then why did you say it was Segwit before?
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:22:50

They can't. Their ASICs are not good for mining other coins (except BCH).

This argument is just as stupid as the poeple who see snow outside their window and say "global warming is not happening, it's cold outside". 
Yes, sometimes you get a cheap fee when there are not many transactions - but overall the situation is not great and could be better, and everyone knows it.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:55:39
Probably the latter. Bitcoin exploded over the last 6 months and coinbase played a big role in that. They probably have a lot going on and just hiring a few more people won't solve today's problems - this stuff takes time.

Isn't GB part of SEPA in the EU? SEPA transactions are free and need to be on the receiving end after 1 business day. Has worked for me very well in between EU countries without problems.

@_date: 2017-09-20 15:04:23


You are putting words in my mouth.
Everyone wants a usable LN version and nobody wants bullshit dev versions to be sold as usable. So when is usable going to be here, that is the question, but I don't really see many answers.
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:43:39


That is a very weak argument since the supporting companies make a very big part of the bitcoin ecosystem. The number of companies is irrelevant if they vary in size and influence that much.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:13:15
Segwit2x and BCC don't have anything to do with each other.
Edit: If you can downvote, you can tell me the "truth". But you can't, since I am telling it. Bcash and Segwit2x are two completely different things.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:47:32
Since blocks are still full sometimes I would not call a throughput increase unnecessary.
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:29:56
And it is not valid because only 20% of transactions are segwit and those only reduce the blockweight of the transactions by ~30%. That means all the transactions (segwit[20%] + non segwit[80%]) are shrinking to 94% block weight compared to 100% before. That is only a 6% reduction in block weight and therefore not really a factor. Segwit helps, but is not the reason for cheap fees right now.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:42:23
Who are those 100% and where can I see some data on that?
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:09:59
Sure, it's all spam. Nobody is REALLY using BTC, right, right... And oh yes, LN, that sounds good, when can we realistically use it in the field? In a year? In two years?
I am here for BTC, like everyone else. Except I don't see the current problems being sufficiently solved - they MAY be solved in the future, yes. There is hope. But until then we need more - for example 2x - but I know, now I am the devil to you and a puppet of Jihan, right? I can't hear it anymore, but you probably made up your mind already.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:20:12


It's not used because the wallets of all services are not upgraded yet. It's a really new feature that just not every normal joe can use today. It will get better though. Still, it will not be enough. Blocks have been pretty full since 2016 and it's getting worse. At some point we will have LN, but that is years away for the public. 2x would relieve the stress we are currently havin until LN arrives.


If we all agree on 2x there would be no split. Except for politics I have not heard a GOOD technical reason to NOT do 2x. I have heard them all. I'm tired of "centralization!!!" and the like, it's all political bullshit anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:55:56
Uh... I believe the same about you if you don't recognize that Segwit only happened after every miner was signalling for it because of Segwit2x. Forget that?
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:13:01
What people sometimes seem to forget that this is not about "us vs them". If you look at Bitcoin objectively you don't have "big blockers" vs "small blockers". The goal is to make Bitcoin als good as possible, to make it usable in as many use cases as possible. We now have Segwit, which opens up a lot of possibilities for Bitcoin. But still we have problems, the blocks are still full, fees are high, and scaling solutions like LN are literally years away. To make Bitcoin as good as possible and as competitive as possible versus other altcoins, it absolutely makes sense to not only implement segwit, but to also increase the blocksize a little bit. This has nothing to do with BCC, it is only about BTC and how it can be as good as possible. 
If you really try to use BTC and pay for stuff BTC, you realize that there is still a lot of room for improvement right now when it comes to confirmation times and fees. Segwit2x will improve on these points and most arguments against it are politically motivated.

@_date: 2017-10-12 07:17:03
So I'm a shill for who? Jihan or Roger? Maybe I'm Chinese?
You can believe whatever you want if you don't want to face the hard facts - because it is you who does not like what I am saying. It's the truth, even if you can't see it because you know nothing about data analysis. I do this for a living.

If there is reason to believe a conspiracy is happening - fine. But mindless belief that everything is a conspiracy is not really helpful.

You are just repeating the propaganda that is spread without good reason. Fees WILL be lower when network capacity is higher. Spamming will cost more so spamming will become less attractive and thus less frequent. Miner centralization is not really influenced by Blocksize either, why would it? If anything, it would make mining in rural china less advantageous because of bad internet connections.

Especially since I get the feeling that a lot of teenagers are shitposting in BTC forums like their lives depend on it. I would like to find a nice place that is not dead with some sensible human beings.

I think 100$ is the limit you can sell stuff like that at. If you can do it for 99$ people would buy it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:48:26
There is one. But unfortunately you don't see that very often these days.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:23:24


Hey man, you got LN network running already?
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:04:35
That's not segwit though. It's a standard feature of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:32:22
I simply don't care about teenagers and my ego is strong enough to not compare myself to everyone I see on the internet all the time, sorry. The one thing I notice is that some people shitpost here like there is no tomorrow and that gets on my nerves. This subreddit has become a pretty shitty place, it has not always been like that. Yes it always had memes, but there was always some kind of good discussion going on and it was not as insulting and onesided as it is today.
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:00:54
Sure, because they make more money how?

Wow, that is just wrong. If bitcoin explodes, you are left with nothing. If you invest in ETFs, you probably don't lose it ALL because there are a lot of governments and societies connected to all these companies around the globe. It's definitely more risky to invest in BTC and to say anything else is a clear sign of delusion.

The problem with your data is, that you compare "meta" data - like ALL miners signaling for 2x - and compare it to the small number of users INSIDE of a mining pool, that is mostly comprised of people who have no interest in 2x. You can't compare that data. 
It is like comparing national polling data vs. the polling data from a trump rally. You would get similar results to what you found here, where a majority would like x, and the minority would like y - and you could again say "the small guy likes Trump!" - but it would not make sense to compare these numbers.
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:30:05


Thanks, I'll take a look at that.
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:20:58
There is an unusual amount of anti 2x posts today.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:47:56
no, this account has been on reddit for a month.

Of course this data is biased. You can't just pull random numbers and say "It's raw data, I did not manipulate it, it is unbiased". That is not what biased means. The sole fact that you CHOSE the data and COMPARE the numbers in the way that you do, gives it a bias. 
If you would compare your salary to a rich guy's salary, you would find that you are poor. If you would compare your salary to a poor guy's salary, you would find that you are rich. The way you choose and compare numbers give them a bias if you don't do it right and "scientifically".
I am not here to offer any other or "better" numbers, I have other stuff to do. I am just here to tell you that what you try to read into your numbers is not working and that it's not possible to conclude anything based on what you have here. Your comparisons don't really make sense in an objective way and it speaks badly for this sub that after 30 comments I am the first guy to point this out, because it is obvious.
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:31:00


Lol, are you kidding me? This thing looks unbelievable from start to finish. The guy produced this shit with his torrented adobe premiere and some stock footage in his basement, anyone could have done it. The lies are so far out there that it's outright crazy to even discuss it seriously. If you believe shit like this you are a conspiracy nut... but I guess there are a lot of conspiracy nuts around here....

In the last hours something caused a serious spike in transactions. 
Your 5 s/b are suddenly not enough to get into the next block. All you can do now is wait until the # of transactions reduces iteslf. You will get a turn as soon as all people who paid more fees had their go. You can monitor what's happening on the graph above, it's live. It'll probably just take a few hours or a day until it's your turn.

What does spreading completely imaginary fears do? Nothing. It won't help to spread the FUD further, it will only lead to some stupid people believing it and spreading it even further. Just ignore this stupid shit and it WILL go away. I only saw this shit because you posted it - if you hadn't done that we would have never known this shit existed.
It's OK to spread facts because then "Sunlight is the best disinfectant". I agree. But these are not facts, it's just bullshit, and spreading bullshit only promotes bullshit.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:33:38
What kind of shitty FUD video is that? Where is the source? What is "Casey Research LLC"? Lol.
Just downvote this shit.
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:48:11
Yeah, who needs schools, roads and police anyway? Fuck that!
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:19:29
So you say we will have a usable LN network for everyone in 3-4 weeks? I will quote you on that.
RemindMe! 5 weeks "LN network ready to use?"
