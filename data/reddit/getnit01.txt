Is he really evil, really? Or is this just an upset brother making yet another excuse. I'll bet that he has been better than you your whole life and this is yet another example of how he has bested you since day one? Come man, time to own up to your short comings. Admit it, your evil twin brother is just better than you. Quit making excuses.

You are talking about an unforseen event (meaning it is not likely you are going to die within an hour, statistically) i am talking about a predicable event.
All i am saying is, there are certain people/governments/powerful people who do not want Bitcoin to survive. We have seen Coinbase and GDAX go down before and it severely effected the price. What better time to coordinate an attack on the largest exchange.

Oh i lost out, had about 30 LTC i started selling around $290 and a couple more around 340, wasnt expecting 420 (on GDAX) for an ATH! Had some buys at 300 that i didnt think were going to fill, but damn LTC sure as hell is trying to find a bottom. Might put in some more buy orders around 200 area but this selloff is quit eye opening. Added up a couple more ETH while i wait for LTC to turn but those im holding for long term.
BTC im still shaky on, not sure what the near term looks like (which means its probably going higher) but i think all coins are looking good for 6-9 months from now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:59:23
LOOKOUT BELOW!!! Going to keep going down until GDAX is fixed, wait until tomorrow when they get all the bugs out!

just because you dont agree with something makes it a dick move? The same logic can be said about many other things in your life, like say there is a pretty girl you were talking to at the bar, you get up and go to the bathroom, while you were in there another guy comes along and the girl you've been talking to ends leaving with him, is that a dick move or just the girl going with the better choice?

Haha, doesnt feel bad sucker, took a nice ride with litecoin from $68 all the way to $345, so yeah it feels real good, hope you enjoyed your double, i'll take my 5 bagger and be happy. better luck next time.

So is it the girls ignorance for going home with the evil twin brother or was he just the better more advanced brother?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:59:16
Hmm, yeah, disrupt. I am not sure what you are trying to point out as the end result, but the end result i am pushing here is that powerful people want to see confidence in bitcoin (ie the price per bitcoin) decline or not be attractive. So, they will find any and all ways to "disrupt" or help make bitcoin not a safe store of value.
Attacking the largest exchange during a scheduled maintenance could prove to be a good time to "disrupt" Bitcoin.

I wasnt bailed out and i lost a lot of money on a regular bank financed home (like $150K in Value) where was my bailout? I lost a good portion of my investment (almost 40%) while doing nothing wrong.

I'm not shorting I'm holding, I'm just giving my input on what I just saw and have seen in the past in a related field. I believe in Bitcoin just noticing some big players wedging themselves into the middle of the game.

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:05:42
Depends on what you think. Segwit2x news getting cancelled, big time Wall Street players wanting to get in but not pay higher prices, $900 price rise in under an hour, fast rise in altcoins seems like people with big influence/money are working hard to get in the game. If it could go lower it is because some big/smart money players are making their move to get coin at a lower price.

I only have 1 other friend who knows about this, my family would never go for it (like retirement fund type invest) so its really only me by myself getting my toes wet. I just dont see the investment of $1,500 paying off, i mean a 30% move would only net me $450 but that would mean bitcoin would have to reach almost $8,000 for me to even make $450? I mean thats nice and all but i would much rather make $1,800 instead of $450. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:15:24
I want to!!!! Believe me i believe in the story, i just dont believe this game can be played for person like me who does not have $25,000 or more to play at these current prices.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:13:19


 uh huh....




Thanks, oh great and powerful smart person for repeating, verbatim, what i said, you have proven yourself most helpful today.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:36:47
Ok, now thank you! I feel like you have been the most helpful with this comment right here, everyone seems to be bashing me for not understanding this whole bitcoin thing. I want to get in, i just dont know why me buying at the all-time high is turning into me being dumb not buying right now? 
I have read something about this fork happening, i dont fully understand it, i read comment on it yesterday i think but still didnt fully understand it. So when a fork happen someone mentioned something about pulling your bitcoin off the market (is that right word) so your bitcoin doesnt get caught in the fork (i have no clue what the hell is going on there? Why do you get a different kind of bitcoin when bitcoin forks? So confusing) So this is where i am lost and buying at the all-time high doesnt excite me either, especially when $6,000 is waaaay out of my price range! (i know i can buy fractions of a bitcoin) Oh and i dont want to buy ethereum or litecoin as others have mentioned, bitcoin is all i am interested in, if ever, everyone seems to think bitcoin is not for normal people who dont know what is going on?
So sorry for ignorance on bitcoin or what to do, or how to do it, or why i should do it, i want to do it, im just not a professional i guess you could say at doing bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:03:15
I get that but it doesnt increase the same as say someone who put in $50,000 at $5,000 as compared to me who can only afford to put in $1,500 at $6,000 i feel like anyone who has more than $25,000 or more are the ones who are going to be making out during this whole crazy time.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:14:00


Well i can put that money to work in other places, im just saying i would much rather $6,000 double (or if it gets to $10,000 per bitcoin) than my say $1,500. Im just saying it seems a lot more valueable for someone who can invest larger amounts of money right now than my paltry $1,500 :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:00:44
I like bitcoin more than the say the other one ethereum or i think litecoin is available to buy, i would much rather my $6,000 double than my 1500 double? Does that make sense? I mean if it hits $10,000 then i can still only buy a third of heck even a tenth of what the people with 100's of thusands of dollars are putting in.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:20:51
Im not trying to be dumb here, im trying to tell my story, i dont have large sums of money to stash away in this experiment called bitcoin, I cant risk $5,000 or $25,000 or $100,000 and be fine with possibly losing 15% or 20% of that investment until i get a return. I want to get in, trust me, i just dont see how risking $1,500 of my hard earned cash is going to benefit me compared to someone who is investing $25,000 and getting a 30% return ($7,500) as compared to me investing $1,5000 and getting a 30% return ($450) that is a $7,000 difference in return on invesment, i would much rather make $7,500 on my investment than $450, i mean wouldnt you? Like i said, i think at this point it is a rich mans game and little o me who cant afford to aprt way with large sums of money makes this game (at $6,000 for 1 bitcoin) a little out of my comfort zone.

Wait, is this the dogecoin subreddit? :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:08:30
I dont have 6k to begin with, i have 1,500 i could part with and take a stab but the gains on that for a 30% move would only be like $450, a 30% move with $6,000 would get me $1,800 that sounds more worth my while, does that make sense what i mean by i think it will be a rich mans game from here on out?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:57:15
My god, thank you!!!! This makes sooo much more sense!!! Thank you for the link, i am on coinbase opened an account in may just never got around to actually doing anything with it, in the process of getting my bank verified so ill have to learn more about this bitcoin fork thing and hardware wallet.
Thank you very much for explaining this much more clearly than just buy now type comment! Thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:10:15
I do, i just dont see the point in making 30% or even 50% on say like $100 or $500. I mean thanks for the $150 on my $500 fun investment but eh, $150 aint much to brag about.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:30:24
I mean for a 30% gain on $100, $30 doest seem like its worth it to go through all these ups and downs.

Thanks for the insult, and no i am not a troll, i dont understand why me giving my point of view (as someone who does not own any bitcoin but wants to) is being a troll? And like i said i feel it is going to be a rich mans game and now someone who knows way more about bitcoin than i ever will persons game judging by how you are treating me. Im sorry my thinking on this bitcoin game is not up to par with your masterful bitcoin intelligence.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:42:11


Possibly :) all im saying is i have been watching tv and reading news and watching videos on bitcoin, i like the idea, i just feel $6,000 is awefully a lot of money to part ways with. I know i can invest $100 and make 30% and make $30 but $30 doest seem like all that much money for all the ups and downs i have seen bitcoin do in the past 5-6 months. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:42:05


Exactly. Nobody in their right mind would write a story like that and know that there will be major backlash/interest - and just go to sleep? If you're breaking a story this big (probably the biggest one you have ever written) you most definitely will not be going to bed! Not a chance in hell.
