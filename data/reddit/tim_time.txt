I want to hear more about this. How much of a soft fork is this really? How useful will out of date clients, nodes, and miners really be? The lack of information I've been able to gleen about this makes me cautious and I echo your perspective that the soft fork would be better off as a hardfork since everyone with any stake will upgrade in either case.
The OP really didn't provide a strong argument against hardforks besides making them sound more difficult than they are then distracting us with how cool sigwit is. Sigwit is pretty cool, but that's a totally separate discussion than how best to introduce it and whether this "soft fork" is really that soft.
In any case, we should start talking about a hardfork to raise the blocksize and clean up the protocol now, in order to be prepared.

For one, those numbers aren't an absolute. It could safely go much faster if it needed to. For another, that's about how long segwit has been upcoming. In any case, we should start talking about how hardforking would work now. The sooner it is an available option the more prepared we are for when we need it.
Also, sigwit being a good thing isn't directly relevant to the discussion of how best to introduce it. The only relevant thing you say is "hardforking is hard" and you don't go into detail.
Edit: on second look, your post reeks of careful presentation to influence opinions without providing anything new. Your title states "soft fork &gt; hard fork any day xD" but your post basically says "sigwit is cool and we want it now and doing it by hardfork will take longer".

You are blind to what I was trying to get across to you. Like describing the sound of water to a deaf person.

Seriously... condescending.
Hearing other people who understand the changes talking about it is much more reassuring than simply reading Core Approved press releases. More eyes more certainty. But by "continue to function" do you mean losing no functionality or information whatsoever? That doesn't seem like it would be the case.

You're drawing a metaphor where bitcoin transactions are to be seen as a type of bank transaction. Bitcoin should be more like the banking system, good idea.

There is still no argument against starting work right now to increase the blocksize to 4MB. There is no reason to not hardfork if enough forewarning is given before the fork. It would be beneficial to establish hardforking as an expected routine procedure sooner rather than later.

A regular fork would still be safer. You can't escape influence. By having a regular hardfork you can, and I'm going to repeat myself, address that pressure predictably than have it build up, allowing it to be co-opted by a more drastic and destabilizing political movement.
Switching to an altcoin or sidechain would not have a better outcome than a hardfork. And according to some here, a hardfork is an altcoin, and discussion of altcoins is discouraged.

That actually sounds like a reason, thanks. If it's as simple as that, then it is reasonable that sigwit come first. A 2MB block limit, given the delays on sigwit, still doesn't seem unreasonable, but I guess there's only so many things that can be done at once.
This makes me wonder about core's position on raising the block limit after sigwit if we again reach the fullness we currently see.
I still think a carefully considered and scheduled hardfork, with uncontentious improvements and simplifications, would be a good thing to have happen every two or three years, though.
Edit: Looking into it a bit, that is transaction size that currently raises verification time quadratically, not block size. I remember reading that if block size was increased, transaction size could be limited to prevent this from becoming a problem. I can understand how doing that is kinda a pain to implement then remove once sigwit makes that limit unnecessary, though.

Sounds like we need a hardfork.

What still has many not convinced is the apparent inability for this mind changing information to be presented clearly and succinctly. I and many others would really like to read a straightforward explanation if it exists.

hahah nice meme post XDDDD good discussion :DDDD

If ever many people agree with you, bitcoin is dead.
Being able to competitively perform permission-less transactions over distance is what gives bitcoin value, you baboon.
If bitcoin (or LN, etc.) doesn't compete with credit card companies, then it has failed.

I think the fears are unfounded hyperbole.
A carefully considered and scheduled hardfork, with uncontentious improvements and simplifications, would be a good thing to have every two or three years. Otherwise compatibility layers will continue to bloat and certain improvements will be unattainable. The undebated benefits of a hardfork will only grow with time. Better to address that pressure predictably than have it co-opted by a political movement.

I don't think there are good reasons to avoid hardforks entirely. If anything, there should be a scheduled, yearly hardfork used to simplify the codebase.
