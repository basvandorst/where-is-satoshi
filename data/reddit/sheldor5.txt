Bitcoin ... 10$ transaction ... lol'ed
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:39:38
Then it should be a normal transaction which you can see on any blockchain explorer ... but your transaction will take a while, depending on your transaction fee ... also you will loose some money because of that transaction fee ...
But I am no bitcoin expert and I never tried to send myselfe bitcoin ...
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:27:32
Obviously the amount for 3 Bitcoin ...
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:27:40
I only read "I am butthurt" ...
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:40:44
This guy surely hadn't 2FA enabled ...
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:31:45
First you should read what a bubble is ...
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:29:22
So ... the guy had an idea, made his own currency, mined most of it by himselfe, and did nothing afterwards than waiting to be a bilionaire ... most people with a job have more "real" value but still get a shit of a salary ... this is the world we are living in now
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:05:58
Hiw can the phishing site log him in AND bypass the second 2FA request for the unknown IP?
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:28:20

Money never brought me happiness, but my family and friends did ...
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:47:38
I don't think that 1. an AI will do things like earning money like a human for food and home and 2. an AI has any interest in earning money 3. an AI will use a fast and feeless currency if 1 and 2 are wrong ...

@_date: 2018-01-03 21:26:39

@_date: 2018-01-08 15:40:16

@_date: 2018-01-13 08:56:44

Ia Google Authenticator bad?
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:46:28
Could it was a phishing site? It looked like binance but it wasn't ....
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:10:16
Get a lawyer then?
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:47:06
How can you revert a transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:02:12
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:26:35
I bet you don't even know what a bubble is ... like many many others here ...
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:36:04
If you are stupid enough to download and run an unknown program you deserve to get fucked ... seriously there is no magic ... just silly people ...

by killing trees you don't have to worry anymore if they no longer exist ...
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:45:53
Can you explain this a bit more?
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:30:09
You have to ask the exchange owners/developers ...
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:16:24
People who cry because they didn't got rich by doing nothing are the worst in this community ...
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:17:04
Maybe I expressed myselfe wring since I am no english nativ speaker but I know what a bubble is and how it works and every speculative property/asset is a bubble ... also bitcoin ...
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:28:18
Because you are more concerned by the fact that you aren't rich now like many others? ;-D
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:29:51
You are right. But if I want to use an unknown way of payment with an unknown currency I MIGHT want to google it first ...
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:02:45
Most people can't ...
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:50:26
I would be amused ;D
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:54:41
Yes that looks like a minimum of security ... xD
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:31:33
Don't use kraken. For now just wait and be patient ...
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:27:32
I lol'ed ...
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:33:58
you misunderstood me lol ... but glad you wasted time to make it clear xD
If something gains value by pure believing without real reasons, then this "bubble" grows. When most people want to sell this thing, because they think now is the perfect time, all want to sell it because they see that everyone wants to sell ... and if everybidy wants to sell while nobody wants to buy ... everybody looses all his money since nobody wants to trade ...
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:33:58
And what should we do? Go to the police if you got robbed ...
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:38:26
p.s educate yourselfe what a bubble is before making false assumptions
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:10:42
sadly there is no official source/parliamentaly documentation ... I only found some comments/blogs
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:38:52
In order to turn 2FA off you must log in with 2FA enabled ... once 2FA is enabled you need 2FA to login and to disable 2FA again you need 2FA too ... so no "hacking" someones account with 2FA requires the 2FA code which you only get from your authenticator app meaning from your physical phone
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:48:56
I only hold some IOTA but I am paranoid as fuck ...
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:31:51
He is right in most cases. The blockchain was a genius step, but as you can see the larger it gets the slower it will be. The blockchain ia kind of an old technology and needs some upgrades. At the moment its value is only based on believing and as long as everyone believes in it it is working but as soon as most btc owners want to sell them to get rich and nobody will buy them from the sellers ... nobody gets money and the price will drop damatically ... to get USD from BTC somebidy has to trade his USD for your BTC ... this is called a bubble ...
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:43:12
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:00:48
Did you had 2FA enabled?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:35:49
How about contacting the kraken support?
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:01:11
They are lost forever.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:26:07
Do I own BTC? Not a single satoshi ...
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:01:17
Well it IS your fault ... you had minimal to no security and also reused a password across multiple accounts ... rule  unique passwords for each account/website
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:34:59
It's a fake ...
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:34:32
The polar ice is melting ... good luck ...

2.3 Million $ and you are asking random dudes on the internet? This is a case for the Coinbase support ...
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:40:50
Sure I am ... but you keep responding so you must need the attention even more ;D
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:57:19
Not their money ... not their fees ... lol
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:31:47

@_date: 2017-12-14 23:42:26
Cloudflare problems? Are you kidding me? these issues are 100% kraken issues ... just google how many users have problems with trading, withdrawals, etc. ... stop defending kraken for their disastrous handling
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:54:05
