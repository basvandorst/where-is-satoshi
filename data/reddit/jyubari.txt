I've posted in this subreddit before about this same topic. Harassment from payment processors is extremely nerve-racking. I've been sent 48 hour takedown notices from them for the most asinine things (e.g. a character has pointy ears = animal = beastiality). With no other choice I am forced to take down comics that are even "PG rated" due to the threat of losing my merchant account. 
Recently I've integrated bitcoin (via coinbase) on my checkout page but still under 1% of people are paying with bitcoin or even know what it is when I tell them they can pay in bitcoin. 
We aren't on the moon yet.

I received the same message from a different address. Came to post as well. Watch out guys!

Cool service. In our case we wanted to offer sign in credentials for subscribers (like Netflix's model). Coinbase has a decent API for creating something like this.

Just wanted some genuine advice after reading through plenty of posts.

Perhaps something to do with media FUD about volatility and the mtgox collapse... I just do my best to clear up any doubts!

There are several reasons for the slow adoption (some of which are outlined in other comments). As a producer I can share some of my views on why I think this is.
* Most sites do not handle their own accounting and billing, thus they are used to using 3rd party payment processors to handle membership. If they switched over to bitcoin it would involve modifying their business model (see: recurring payments) and programming a custom coded back end. 
* Despite a few forward thinking porn pioneers most of these guys are older dudes who made a shit ton of money in the 90s and early 2000s. They are not the most savvy group as I often hear touted. However, once a few major players adopt a new system (HD, Bluray, Tube sites, etc.) they will follow in hopes of not missing the bandwagon. This hasn't happened yet. 
* Porn sites rely heavily on affiliate referrals. As of now I don't think there is any system offering affiliate splits using bitcoin. Once producers and affiliates have a 3rd party (or block chain technology) to split referral payments as agreed they might be willing to adopt bitcoin. 
* Many producers are in Eastern Europe or South America where it isn't particularly easy to convert BTC to fiat yet. Producers in the US and Western Europe don't necessarily have this issue. 
It's going to happen. I already accept bitcoin on my websites because I believe in the power of the technology.

Thanks. It's all in good fun.

True. We hold the bitcoin to pay contributors. Hopefully more people will start accepting it.

That's called "shrunken woman" or SW and is pretty common.

Hey. I am working on 1 month integration but I want it to be an automatic feature rather than have to create the accounts manually. 
Here is the option for you at a discounted rate:
