He was off but not entirely wrong, they're using gold to strengthen their position in the SDR at the IMF that's why they've been buying huge amounts of it. There's no need to throw names around

Nice job I can see why it won, accurately researched. I'd argue the existing system has to fail to make the advantages seen to most. Not in a nihilistic way. This is happening as we speak

Great reference. Let us never forget

That's right nothing to see, China isn't collapsing it's all fine. 30 trillion of debt in 10 years all good, no unrest, everyone in China is dancing on rainbows, no rioting every time property prices crash, no mass migration back to the rice fields, empty cities aren't falling apart, it's a really well run economy, almost as good as Janet's

A safe asset has no counterparty risk. He doesn't mention this. Everything else he describes in this article is him trying to get to this fact but never getting there

Double speak is desperation: they claim it's restricting people's freedoms to see the all the content available to them.  Hilarious! It's a choice to use it or not like all ad-blocking browsers.  Shameful twisting of Libertarian arguments, not clever

I was just about to write that word for word, it's sad that it's come to this. Progress is progress though!

1) Force people to use insecure browsers to see all ads
2) Anyone who doesn't want to do 1) is accused of violating their own human right to see ads and is forced back into 1) in the name of freedom

Interesting to see the tide turn, it's gone from don't go near the thing to if you have some playing money stick it in bitcoin. Progress. The gold advice is terrible though, you don't want gold ETF's you want the physical bullion

Exactly. Prices adjust to compensate, real world value is unchanged

Just to be clear this is NOT about the block size limit debate.  This is addressing those that still believe the 21 million unit limit is a hindrance to Bitcoin.  Preaching to the choir in this thread I know, but still.

You're confusing quantity with value...
The number of coins is arbitrary, purchasing power (real world value) adjusts with supply. Lost coins aren't an issue
