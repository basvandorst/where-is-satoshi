Yes but the physical gold I got in exchange for it sure is.

Yes of course. I'm a working professional engineer. Capital gains has been deferred for now. Since I flipped it all into physical gold.

First name Mo?
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:11:41
Yes I did. Had other investments so I let it sit &amp; rode it out. I'm an engineer. So I don't sit @ home in mom's basement for example...

I made zero gains until I cash out the gold. I'm not a lawyer but I did ask one before I did this. My tax accountant too. Once I cash out the gold then yes capital gains will apply. Please read what I posted above in the other sub.

You can literally trade your bitcoin for gold for the cash price. Major dealers like Apmex, JM Bullion,  Provident take Bitcoin. Usually up to $100K per transaction. They will ship it out express &amp; insured same or next business day. Then you have physical gold bullion. Which lately has been on a tear, while the USD value is down.

Ok say hi to your wife for me you cuck.

Thanks for the support. I did the same in July 2016 with all my silver eagles when spot price hit $21. It hasn't even come close to that since. Maybe I was wrong &amp; Bitcoin will come back &amp; be worth $50K in a few months. But it was a gamble from the beginning. I saw $20K &amp; got the hell out. Maybe Winkelevoss twins will cash it all out tomorrow &amp; it will be worth zero again.

Been 2 years since that sub was active. You should have sent me over to MySpace.

Say hi to mom for me from your basement thanks.

No I want to hear the reasoning why you didn't sell or trade. Believe me I'm not that smart. If I were I would have bought 100 Bitcoin instead of 10...
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:16:41
I'm sorry that your 1 Bitcoin that you mined back in 2010 is worth half as much now. Guess you should have bought a pizza...

In a way yes. You don't have capital gains if you trade it for another commodity. Until you actually cash out the gold. Gold has been on a tear lately. It's a lot easier to store in a bank vault than silver. Silver has been an awful performer for the last year. But mostly the big bullion dealers give you the cash price for using crypto. Plus make the transaction easy. You can trade for precious metals up to $100K with most dealers. I'm not a lawyer or tax specialist. This is not financial or legal advice.
