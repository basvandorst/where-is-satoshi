Yes, but then why does any company generated revenue raise a round?
Now there could be a few reasons for this specifically.
1. Bitcoin is a hot topic and Venture Capital is being thrown around, so they thought they'd pick up some cash at a high valuation while they can in case they can't in the near future.
2. They wanted to grow more quickly and they didn't have enough cash to make the moves they wanted to.

the whole point of bitcoin actually defeats the purpose of uber. I hook up my card, take a ride, and don't even think twice about them charging me $30. BTC poses a lot of problems and I doubt it's worth it.
I mean I'm not anti-btc, but lets be rational here. Sometimes bitcoin is *not* that ideal. A lot of people here are so into bitcoin that they sometimes get a bit carried away and end up making arguments like, "bitcoin is brilliant because it's brilliant". Thats not how you impress people who don't know about btc yet.
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:01:38
I lost you on that one
@_date: 2014-08-07 05:51:07
that's what I was mainly interested at.
That said, I could see Nigerians being able to obtain USD by going through btc easily. Thats pretty dope
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:06:32
They were valued at a pre-money valuation of $250mil
They raised the cash to grow their workforce, and probably all the other reasons you'd expect.
Big deal. Huge valuation.

Biggest problem with bitcoin trading: Clueless tech dudes who know nothing about trading.
You will lose money daytrading btc, the same way you would with daytrading anything.
Buying and holding is something that anyone, with any experience, can potentially gain on.
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:59:23
What do you guys think of itbit?
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:47:56
5 or 10 years when american express makes a virtual currency...
I honestly think paying with a credit card for this is much easier. I don't see how btc offers anything to uber other than a few new paying customers.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:51:55
Why in the world would they do this much work just to get a a few people to use their service? Think like a business, not like a btc fan.
Also, what about a price change while riding?
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:50:01
automatically losing money everytime someone uses a credit card?
Your point about set price is good and would be the solution.
That uptrend since '09 is so irrelevant that for the sake of bitcoin, please do not use it in any arguments. Thats like the worst thing you can say. It's such bad evidence.
@_date: 2014-07-25 02:00:48
Wow, this is pretty sweet. Bitpay or coinbase, whichever they're using, is the **real** winner here. Both those companies have ginormous potential for growth depending on bitcoin's success.
While it's cool to point out how all these companies accept btc, is it important to note that in the end they're still just recieving USD? If they can get the same cash, and potentially real in all the btc nerds, it's a no brainer. Do you guys think that sort of defeats the purpose?
@_date: 2014-01-05 10:08:04
This guy sounds like such a cocky teen. There are a lot of teens on here. You're not going to be put on a pedestal for being 15 and *interested* in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:05:33
Fair, I'm sorry about it then. But, you say you're 'only' 15, and a "very mature teenager and am very bright for my age". The reason it's downvoted is the perceived arrogance, it might be falsely perceived but thats why.
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:10:40
But my point is that for a $17b company it's not worht it to go out of their way to make a enw solution to accept btc. Hopefully one day it is.
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:31:07
What do you mean? Uber's are all around NYC
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:05:51
While I'm laughing at gox's humor, you shouldn't be if your coin  and usd are located at gox.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:54:04
thats actually the worst suggestion I've seen.
Uber is a $17b company. They're not going to put in a bunch of work to change their product just to get some bitcoin users to pay a bit.
That poses a fundamental change to their product and business plan. I can't believe some people here are delusional enough to believe that is a good idea for Uber. Also, what happens when the price changes during your ride? I don't think Uber operates on such large margins.
Remember, think like a business, not like a bitcoin fan boy.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:45:39
I'm not missing the point, your explanation is totally right.
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:34:01
I can imagine this makes Kenyan shilling to USD much easier and efficient. Am I right?
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:25:40
The whole point of uber is that you don't pay at the end. It automatically charges whatever the amount is to your card. Bitcoin actually is an unideal solution for uber.
Still can be used theoretically, but just saying.
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:41:19
This is the worst guess ever. If Soros is dumping bank stocks due to even having bitcoin somewhere in his mind, I'll eat any shoe presented to me, and that's a promise.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:58:19
You said it best. I don't mean they're stealing or doing something illegal, its just an awful price that if you're an amateur you could fall for.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:33:55
nooooo I'm not asking how I can buy it. I'm asking because I'm trying to think of a way one can do it from a website standpoint. Creating a website where it can be done. I know about chargebacks, etc. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:08:12
YESSS!!! Now I can finally hedge my coins and trade real futures on Edward Snowden being the Time Person of the Year for 2013!!! Now I can trade real bitcoin futures, and hedge- If bitcoin crashes, the Chiefs will definitely win the super bowl!
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:46:40
I know this. I'm trying to see if there is a way around it. Maybe buy some internet goods that a site will exchange a bitcoin for. Thats just a bullshit premisw for buying a btc w a card. Idk if this is possible, thats why I asked.
@_date: 2013-11-05 08:06:15
trucoin looks really cool.
Do you specifically know if there is a way to utilize the bots for this? It could look for opportunities while I'm not even monitoring it?
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:36:57
This is why btc trading is so stupid. No one knows anything about trading, and turns to reddit for advice with their positions. They also know nothing about trading.
No one can predict this market except the manipulators. They are making every move and creating the artificial volatility. They are smart guys, it doesn't take much to fool you all. Fell for just about every bull trap possible last night
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:35:26
the market is entirely artificial and controlled by traders anywhere in the world who don't just follow what other people say and have a lot of catch which allows them to easily move the market. y'all are just so oblivious to that
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:32:19
hahahahhaahaha. so wrong. These people are real traders. BTC-e is like a few guys who know how to trade with big money, who control the market and leave very little chance for noobs to profit (nothing wrong with that), and a bunch of noobs who fall for their tricks and shouldn't be trading anything.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:54:02
I'm looking to do this with an altcoin and an object. Can someone help me? I'll give them a free one possibly if they can walk me through. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:40:02
I might be interpreting this wrong, but if I'm not this might be one of the worst counter arguments I've ever seen or heard. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:35:52
I can't believe people are denying that the winklevoss twins are smart. I don't know why they have a bad rep? They're the biggest mainstream supporters of bitcoin, and went to Harvard, yet you still don't like them and acknowledge that they're smart people?
I'd like to see where the hate comes from. I see how people hate on government and wall st on this subreddit even though they're just making shit up because it sounds right, but these guys are huge bitcoin supporters, and have done nothing wrong!
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:40:09
I need to tell you all something. People like Nooku may end up ruining bitcoin's growth. They'll make us look so stupid. They're trying to fit in, and in doing so make these sort of pro-btc statements that are so stupid.
To explain a bubble, think of a growing bubble in the air. Keeps getting bigger. Eventually, it pops and crashes to worthlessness  within a short period of time. The S&amp;P 500 tracks the big name companies. The 'tech' bubble that we are often compared to can be seen around 2000 on that chart. To say the S&amp;P 500 is a bubble, let alone more of a bubble than btc potentially is, is literally one of the most stupid things I've seen on this subreddit. Leave
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:58:51
Well, long story short the entire market is controlled by the traders with the most cash. He was able to pump and dump and move the price at his will. Some loved him some hated him. He was in the NY times and then gave his final goodbye saying they wiped his account, and he was due in court. Probably bullshit. He's responsible for most price moves in the crypto coin market as of recently, and has retired most likely.
He's a smart man and was known for good english, those accounts are people trying to capitalize off of having the same vocal power Fontas had. Obviously fake
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:41:52
Are you kidding m? That guy boarded his flight to the caymen islands, where he will live like a king, like 7 hours ago. Those accounts are totally fake. You guys are sooooo stupid.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:30:02
Does that mean 45 days for the btc to be accepted? Or could one say you can put in cash from paypal and wait 45 days, then you're free to buy. PM me if you can, thanks
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:08:13
Good point, but the counter argument is that there is no rush. Anytime sorta soon. lol
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:23:25
So is there any way around it? Like as if you would purchase some other thing that would inadvertently let you buy btc without chargebacks?
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:44:17
Are you literally kidding me? He didn't make a grand exit and then make 2 shitty replica accounts.
You're honestly the exact type of guy I'd see consistently falling for the bull traps. Just a straight, gullible, idiot.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:18:04
By you guys boycotting it doesn't hurt them at all and it shows there will be no point creating an ios app for btc because all the users flocked elsewhere.
App store is the biggest e-commerce website on the internet. Down the line there has got to be some sort of wallet app if we want bitcoin to become a casually used currency.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:46:57
That's got to be one of the worst attempts I've ever seen. Most definitely cringeworthy. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:22:27
If people are actually stupid enough to believe those are his accounts they deserve to lose money on his pumps.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:34:32
some of the most stupid people I've ever seen on the internet are in that chat on BTC-e. Why does no one realize that there is a manipulator, and you all are just playing his game? You guys still don't catch on. The crash is totally the noobs fault- allowing the manipulator to keep crashing by falling for 10+ bull traps.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:33:40
For you to be a fellow bitcoin supporter I'm disgusted. Please leave the subreddit and don't associate yourself with bitcoin any longer.
People like you, who are criticizing the market when the only market knowledge you have is from bitcoin, really give us all a terrible image.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:31:38
so there will be no problem with the logo if it's copyrighted? I just came up with this because I thought it'd be cool to buy a btc/ltc shirt.
