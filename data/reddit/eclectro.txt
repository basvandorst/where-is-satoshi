So what happened to all the coins that MtGox had? Or they just never had them in the first place?

They should have the ip addresses for those transactions. Nonetheless, would you agree that if MtGox were to go down, the currency would sink in value? Also, as time goes on with MtGox not saying anything, it will itself have a depressive effect on the value of the currency?
Edit: There are other reports of the other exchanges halting withdrawals also.

Bitcoin is like water in pan on the stove. Malleability is like heat. Problems with malleability means there is more heat to the pan. All the heat from Malleability makes the water boil. There is turmoil. The water turns to steam.
The steam is gone. The water is gone.

This article should not be downvoted. It raises a couple of valid criticisms for bitcoin. Probably the one thing that is not accurate is the criticism that the technology should not be used until it is more refined. 
I think a market can determine the risks for itself.

But I think that it's safe to say that the longer MtGox stays closed, the more people will come to agree with my conclusion. Perception can be everything.

Or to put it more simply, the structure of bitcoin is fundamentally flawed and it's systemic. There's probably not enough bitcoin in this world that can fix it, and if there was they wouldn't be able to get it out of MtGox.

It might be more convincing if your reddit account was older than 0 days because you look like a troll now.

Manipulating the value of something is the same as stealing.

Generally "delays" like this by stuff in escrow is done in order "to use your money" interest free for a while. 
Scummy, but it happens all the time with brick and mortar banks and such. 
I suspect that they will hold on until their fingers are pried off.
