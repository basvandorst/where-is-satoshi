1 more layer of transactions was added through Silk Road. How exactly does that remove violence in the whole creation and distribution process?

You make me sick. Is there really nothing that Bitcoiners won't use to pump their coin?
Truly disgusting!

No surprise you like that. 
Normal people outside this sub would be disgusted by it.

Amazing how buying coffee indirectly with Bitcoin seems to be the biggest news here for a week.

I see you like to play with words just to avoid having to answer things you don't like to answer. 
Let's do this again. How does adding 1 more layer of transactions remove any violence anywhere in the drug dealing process?
May i also remind you that your hero tried to have 6 people murdered?
It's also sad we can't have a normal discussion without mouth foaming Bitcoiners downvoting anything that doesn't praise SR. 
This is NOT what the voting system is for.

I'm getting downvoted to hell by the Bitcoin pump brigade. Are you also sorry for me? I didn't see you apologizing to me for some reason.

Don't worry about me. I sold my coins ages ago at 900. They're probably sitting in your heavy bag right now.

4 dollar profit per coin. How many coins do you suggest one should buy to make a fortune? 1000's? What does buying 1000+ coins do to the price you think as soon as you start buying? And dumping 1000's of coins?

Yes, so what?
No, Greece isn't suddenly buying Bitcoin on btce. Stop making a fool of yourself. They are not suddenly putting their money in a near unusable internet currency that lost 70% of its value in the last 15 months and could lose 20% more overnight. 
Think dude, think. Use your brain. Use some common sense. There are 100 more probable explanations for that spike than Greece. Get your head out of fantasy land.

We all know the reason why they want to do this. 
Obviously if they really wanted to help they could send money through other options now but they won't. 
You are fully aware of this. Stop acting like you aren't. Grow the hell up.

Why yes, of course. Only way to go from here is up.

Get a grip man.
