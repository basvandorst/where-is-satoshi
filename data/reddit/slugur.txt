"This may be the final straw for bitcoins. There was a massive selloff today (180k coins and counting) as the price of bitcoins crashed through the $5 price point. Everyone’s jumping ship right now.
There’s really little chance of it ever coming back above that price point. Here’s the all-time chart, this is by far the largest selloff in Bitcoin’s history happening right now."

No. It's not instant. It will take several days to reach your bank account.

As others pointed out, hindsight is always 20/20. I  have been involved in online gambling for a long time and a lot of offshore books were experimenting with bitcoin transactions right around when Mt.Gox happened. At that time, I was offered 30 BTC for $3000 total and I immediately thought it was a scam =[
I still got into the game before the 2017 FOMO started, so I am relatively ok but missed opportunity for 30 BTC still haunts me.

Well, since you love cherry picking, I can also say that gold dropped 40% in about a year before. So are you going to say gold is not considered secure? You can pick a time frame on anything in the world and make a case that it's not secure.

Before you call me "rubbish", I am only claiming  to be up from sports betting. Spread can be beaten in the long run. It's the money management and lack of discipline that will turn a lot of winners into losers. I started in 2002ish when online sports betting was still in its infant stage. Lines were a lot easier to beat and line movement was ridiculous. College bball total would move 10-15 points off opening within seconds and if you knew what you were doing, you  won a lot. Books evolved and general public caught on, so those days are over, but you can still  profit in the long run in sports betting.
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:02:01

Nobody is saying he is innocent. I think we can all agree the punishment doesn't fit the crime.

Here we gooooo

I won't call "10x in 2.5 yrs" unfortunate. I know a lot of people are in this for quick lambo and moon but I will be thrilled if BTC can go from 6k to 60k in another 2.5 years. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:58:15
I am pretty much that guy you described there : ) except my love for cryptocurrency. 
I am in my late 30's, married with 2 kids, work in software security/encryption field and most of my buddies in similar situation as me won't touch bitcoin with a 10 foot pole. They just can't  take the risk.
I have been a risk taker pretty much all my adult life. I was a poster child for online poker boom in early 2000's and I have been doing sports betting since college days. Ironically, online gambling is what led me to cryptocurrency in the first place as I needed a way to move my fund without bending over backwards with banks.

OP is saying that even if the ETF is denied and the price goes back down to $7k, do not worry as the Asian market is much bigger and they don't care about the US ETF. If the ETF is approved, then the price will jump to new ATH and to the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:57:22
Let us know when you decide to rebuy, so we can sell.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:02:58
Lol rekkkkkkkt

McAfee "MY DICK IS ALIIIIIVEEEEE"
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:11:17
Did you??? Lol
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:11:48
But there is a flip side of that coin.
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:26:57
I remember that thread. I am rooting for you, but let's not celebrate too prematurely. The tide can turn any moment. Good luck (to us)
@_date: 2018-07-09 18:37:45
McAfee : Is my dick safe?????
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:34:53
Sounds like a solid game plan.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:42:16
Biggest green dildo in weeks.
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:28:22
With the amount of BTC they are HODLing, it's not a matter of "if" but "when".
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:29:51
The WORLD is not anymore the way it used to be, mm mm MM, NO NO NOH!
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:07:03
Agreed. I was there in 2015 and realized how heavily they rely on cash even for simple every day transactions. Hardly anyone ever uses credit card.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:15:49
So only 60% of them want to see McAfee eating his dick?
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:39:36
Defend that 8.3k line for now, regroup, charge, knock on the 9k wall by Friday and say hi to Vegeta for me.
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:52:23
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:29:34
With that attitude, yeah.
Making "impossible" possible is part of the fun.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:38:29
Or you can just ask for $9876.54.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:31:14
Ok, I know the original meme is his scouter blowing up. What I mean is he is now getting tired of keep coming back every hour as we keep crossing 9000.
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:41:36
1) He gets to keep his dick.
2) We all drive Lambos
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:40:03
Never heard of Yao Ming?
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:46:15
Lol. I was going to type the same thing. Go Lakers.
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:11:03
Well shit, THAT didn't age well.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:20:00
The only positive thing out of this is that we will see Vegeta meme again.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:27:27
9k vegeta is legendary. No need to come up with new 9k memes.
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:14:06
I agree 100% but this ATM IS the fanciest looking one we had so far :)
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:40:02
Let's just say I have never been so curious about the status of another man's dick.
@_date: 2018-04-15 04:45:15
7% of Americans use Bitcoin?? There is no way that's even remotely close to being true. 
I will eat McAfee's dick if that's true.
@_date: 2018-04-30 19:17:43
Funny. Email.com used to be a real email service website in the 90's until it got bought out by mail.com. I still use that "email.com" address for spam mail.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:49:45
Those who said they will wait until BTC goes down to $2k to buy... Yeah, you. How's that plan coming along?
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:32:14
Give another year or two. When that financially "literate" person fomo in, you just smile. You won't even need to say a word.
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:29:01
Exactly. It was under $4k for literally 5 months and you didn't buy. Even if BTC  goes back down to $3k again, you won't buy anyways saying "OMGZ IT DROPPED FROM 8K TO 3K. WE GOING TO ZERO"
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:02:06
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:41:50
That number is way off. You need to make significantly more than $32000 to be in 1% group GLOBALLY. 
1% of world population is about 70 million. 
For the sake of argument, let's assume all age groups (0 to death) are available to work, although this is not realistic.
Population of US + UK + France + Japan + Germany is about 700 million. Even if we assume only 40% of that population is working, that's already 280 million people. Out of 280 million, I can guarantee you more than half makes $32000 per year and that's low balling too. So that's already 140 million from just 5 countries that I mentioned above that should make $32000. Other developed countries will only add to that number. 
TL;DR - There is no way 1% of global population make only $32k a year.
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:52:59
Where is that Rekt and Rekter chart? That one is funnier.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:41:31
Only a tiny tiny fraction % of people lost 90%. You had to be the unluckiest and most idiotic fool to wait until Dec 17, 2017 to buy in at $20k, price that ONLY lasted for a few minutes. Then you proceed to HODL for nearly a year ONLY TO SELL it  yesterday at $3200. Even then it's not 90%. 
Sure... If you bought altcoins and actively traded, then it's possible to lose 90% but that's not what we are discussing here.

This may crash down by morning but it sure feels good to see it go over $4000 for now. It's been a long month.

It's amazing how Fry's is still around.

Why so grumpy, bro?

I can't wait until these assholes go extinct.
@_date: 2018-12-31 08:44:11
Lol. I just realized that after reading your comment.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:31:18
Are you telling me that this is not how it works?!
ATH -&gt; 85% loss -&gt; Today -&gt; 85% gain -&gt; ATH
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:41:29
But that IS the point. General population lacks the basic financial literacy and this "ignorance" is quite troubling. 
Of course, not everyone is going to know the value of Pokemon cards, but we are talking about silver here. I am not saying you should know the exact price of silver but you SHOULD have a general idea that 10 oz of silver will be worth MUCH MUCH more than a bag of Hershey's chocolate.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:14:29
That is the best part of the whole rant.
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:37:00
"When mining ends...."
That should be the least of your worries right now.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:40:13
^ This guy wins.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:19:30
Yes, this is a valid strategy. Like others suggested, sell now and claim the loss on your 2018 tax. But don't forget to buy back your BTC right away and keep holding.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:30:56
Umm. No. Not even close.
Nakamoto is not a common last name in Japan.
Nakamura and Yamamoto are very common, much like Jones and Brown in the US. I won't be surprised if this name was just made up by combining Naka+Moto.
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:24:17
Bitcoin is not some magic wand that will take wealth away from the rich and redistribute equally among the poor. That was never the intention of the bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:03:04
Let's ask those who still hodling BITCONNNNEEECCCCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTT. NO NO NO.
