This is why you just don't tell anyone you're hodling

Sir I am a Nigerian prince and will pay you 500k if you give me the 10k in taxes upfront.

I was a conversation about when we'd actually cash out with a mate the other day.
If it's not life changing, like living mortgage free...we HODL.  In your case you did the right thing and set yourself up for life.

Excessive yes - But pales in comparison to the money being transferred.  I'd want to see it verified pretty quickly myself

I'm a simple man, a punto

yeah and we could have invested in stocks, or just about anything if we could see into the future.  No point kicking ourselves

Haha where abouts is this?  Need to treat myself to some tools

To be honest, if we're talking big rooms I think it would be safer if there were no locks on the doors.  
We're not talking about a bank with staff anymore, we're talking about someone potentially getting trapped lol.

Placing these things into shopping centres / train stations / anywhere is fucking expensive.
  
We looked into rent for just placing arcade machines (Think skill testers etc) as a business and it would have taken ages to break even with optimistic usage predictions.
When you factor in the limited usage these things will get it's hardly surprising they have high fees.  As adoption increases I'd expect the fees to drop significantly.
