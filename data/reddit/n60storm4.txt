Call me old fashioned but I like the idea of having every single transaction on the blockchain. It's really the most decentralised way to do it. Having huge blocks in 29 years won't be an issue due to technological improvements.

That means nothing as your BTC wouldn't be turned into fiat in this BTC bank as that makes no sense in this scenario.
@_date: 2015-01-11 09:17:27
Use the amazon database server which allows local connections or possibly do a chron job for regular SCP backups to Bitstamp's server.

Blockchain.info is pretty good now that they've fixed the random generator. It's actually pretty safe because you own your private key with it. That means it is more safe than coinbase, circle, etc.

@_date: 2015-05-23 09:01:13
Use a system like blockchain.info where you own the private keys, not as secure as a Trezor but more than coinbase, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:15:54
It is a fork though. It's just a question of if the majority of the network will follow the new rules or not. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:50:17
Because that's bad for the consumer. No one wants to pay more.
If you want Bitcoin to succeed higher fees are not the solution. Bitcoin shouldn't be limited to the rich, it should be for the people by the people.
You're thinking like a bank.
@_date: 2015-08-23 04:05:34
Make sure it's not on a web wallet. With larger amounts of money look into a paper wallet or a Trezor.

XT is BIP101 right now because BIP101 isn't going into core and it should be. I support BIP101, not XT. Currently I'm running an XT node because I support BIP101, I'd rather use core but until they adopt 101 I can't.
This has been in discussion for years, this isn't some random thing that just popped up.
@_date: 2015-08-21 06:14:50
Why do that when we could keep fees low by allowing more transaction per block.
I get 0% fees when transferring money using fiat (non-US banks are cool like that) so BTC needs to keep smaller transaction fees to stay competitive. I'm fine with paying ~0.1mBTC as a fee (NZ$0.4) but I don't want to pay much higher. I'm not saying BIP101 is the way to do this (although I think it is), but it is important fix that needs to happen some way or another.
I love the control Bitcoin gives me, but that's not enough - it needs to be competitive to fiat.

Don't you care about people outside of you're little bubble? Some people in our global society get abused and you don't care?
People come before money in every way. Call me a commie or a socialist, it doesn't matter. I think Bitcoin could revolutionise money handling in places where there is next to none. Higher fees aren't the answer to wider adoption. Banks show us the extremes of capitalism, and like any extreme... it's bad.

That's not good for Bitcoin. Higher tx fees will reduce adoption.
@_date: 2015-09-05 04:36:29
What is your magical method that raises the blocksize without raising hardware requirements then?
If you are for bigger blocks you have to give a reason of how you will get around the argument of hardware increases. Moore's Law is the best way to answer this, but I'd like to hear your answer if you disagree with that?
@_date: 2015-09-06 19:37:48

Adoption is important for usage, low tx fees is a big selling point. Low adoption due to high tx fees is objectively bad for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-09-05 21:06:44
Adding in insults into your argument isn't achieving anything other than adding fat to your points.
In BIP101 blocks will be filled as needed, that means that there could well be &lt;1MB blocks sent through by BIP101 miners. Increasing the max block size doesn't mean blocks will be at the new max block size.
Also you care about this way too much.
@_date: 2015-09-04 06:16:52
Currently it is about 4 cents anyway. As the network gets more congested fees will go up by far more than one cent. Due to technological improvement bigger blocks aren't an issue. By including more transactions into a bigger block they can get more revenue anyway.
Why are you against decreasing future network congestion?
@_date: 2015-09-05 23:50:21
The cap raises over time and soft-capping is still a thing.
I never said I didn't care, I said you care about this too much. There's no need to be getting angry about it - this is a fun tech project with the power to change the world. This community can get very hostile which scares away new members.

@_date: 2015-09-06 05:39:53
Soft capping is optional though, it's not like miners will be forced to do it.
By the time we get 20MB blocks miners will probably have the capacity to handle it. Also dont pretend that mining is fair. Block difficulty is a far more centralising force than block size. Storage is cheaper than processing power.

That isn't a fair statement to make as you're generalising all religions.

Your scenario won't happen. If you won't listen to my points I'm done.
Your not enjoyable to talk to

By the time blocks get bigger so will hard disks.
@_date: 2015-04-27 06:29:59
Love the community here.
@_date: 2015-04-24 23:33:14
I'm not American. What are state lines?
@_date: 2015-09-04 13:12:50
Yup. 1TB will be tiny then.
@_date: 2015-09-18 00:26:34
My strategy is to have fun with some new tech.
Sadly most people here care too much about money and make it all boring.
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:29:04
Text posts don't get karma.

It doesn't. The Bible warns against addicting activities but gambling is not specifically a sin. Why would it be? Gambling can be innocent fun, it's only a problem when it becomes an addiction.

Depends what country you're from. In the USA use coinbase or circle. Once you have them download Mycelium (on Android) or Bread wallet (on iOS) and send the bitcoin to that.
Whatever you do when you buy it, don't leave it with the people who sold it to you (don't keep it in coinbase or circle)
@_date: 2015-09-01 05:38:58
That sounds like it should be illegal. Isn't there some regulation to stop this in the USA?
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:47:52
Exchanges can get hacked. A common saying here is that if you don't own the private key you don't own the bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:55:13
Is a material design update in the works?

However, if CF went rouge the services could simply change their DNS to run somewhere different.

Nothing beats a New Zealand pie.
Edit: Thanks for the tip though!

If a private company doesn't want to do a transaction they shouldn't have to. Forcing BTC-e to accept stolen coins is wrong.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:43:50
Like how Australian pavlova is just New Zealand pavlova with a made up origin story?
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:15:17
This seems cool. What types of pie do you recommend to buy with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-21 06:01:50
Bitcoin is the blockchain. They are codependent.
@_date: 2015-03-02 07:22:54
500 bits
@_date: 2015-03-27 12:00:59
I like mBTC. It fits the current price of BTC better than using uBTC (bits).
Unless BTC is $10000 or higher I think bits would look a bit weird.
@_date: 2015-03-21 05:45:31
Bitcoin was never anonymous, nothing is happening. Bitcoin was designed this way.
@_date: 2015-03-21 05:40:04
Agreed. 500 bits @_date: 2015-10-13 03:02:50
Yup. Although this ad doesn't make us out in a nice light. It makes us seem like angry hippies.
@_date: 2015-10-12 08:13:18
Because of us. We're a very hostile community.
@_date: 2015-02-16 06:25:03
On your first screenshot you've zoomed in.
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:00:52
Did you even read the post? If you use multisig on coinbase the keys are made client-side and it requires your key to send money.
You are in no way giving coinbase your private keys.
@_date: 2015-02-13 04:13:20
Google doesn't limit Android either. You can still download the app from the Mycelium website. This is just whether Google wants to spend *their* money on bandwidth to have it in Google Play.
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:56:45
Then don't. No one is forcing you to use coinbase.
@_date: 2015-02-14 07:14:07
Not in New Zealand either.
