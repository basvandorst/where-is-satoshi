i am just blown away by the avalanche of stupid by these supposed accountants in replies to your post. when you deposit funds at a bank or exchange, you become a creditor of the institution and your funds show up on their balance sheet as both an asset and a liability.

you have to keep in mind that VC involvement is a huge factor in these bloated valuations companies have been receiving for the past few decades. in many cases, a company is valued at a ridiculous multiplier of its EBITDA or earnings, and that is a function of what someone else is willing to pay for its shares, e.g. VC1 pays X USD per share, the company gets lots of users and media buzz, VC2 pays 2X USD per share 12 months later.
as long as the next guy is willing to pay the new price for the shares, the valuation keeps going up. sounds kind of like a ponzi scheme, doesn't it? :)

to say that "bitcoin is apolitical money" is a context-dependent statement: it depends on which politics you're talking about. bitcoin is like a central bank in that it is centrally planned by a handful of people, and everyone outside that small group of people have absolutely zero power to change bitcoin.

DATA MARMOTS... IN **MY** BLOCKCHAIN!?!?
@_date: 2016-04-28 17:44:39
if you've ever setup mysql or any other db with replication or any other type of failover, it's not too hard to see why a blockchain is superior to a typical db. blockchains are incredibly fault tolerant, fraud resistant and contain an audit trail. you can get this same configuration out of a db, but it takes lots of work to setup, maintain and then store reliable audit trails.
there are certainly applications where a normal db is much better than a blockchain, and all blockchain tech uses a db to store tx and other data. in some sense, a blockchain is a database with a bunch of extra infrastructure baked into it.

this is a pretty decent question, albeit one that a central banker would ask.
one of the main draws of Bitcoin is how straightforward and transparent the issuance of the coin is, e.g. only 21M can exist, effective inflation is entirely deterministic. fiat currencies that are centrally managed are typically opaque and their value remaining stable is a function of that opacity, e.g. if people can see what's actually happening in a centrally planned currency, it is hard to manage it effectively. beyond it being difficult to manage, there are myriad conflicts of interest in determining where and how to inject "liquidity" into such a system.
i think such a coin would go over very poorly since it's a reimplementation of the central planning ball-and-cup game.

bitcoin is a response to banks having entirely too much power and being able to arbitrarily create money via fractional reserve systems, so it is utterly unsurprising to see banks use a sock puppet (read Lawsky/NYDFS) to attempt to regulate on bitcoin.
governments and banks having control over money is a decidedly bad thing in most cases. both groups are heavily incentivized to not fix the underlying problems with the economy and will, given the ability, blow another credit bubble to kick the can far enough down the road for the current leaders to pass the baton to the next person who will "fix" the next credit bubble.

i expect the restrictions on "cash" in bank accounts to continue becoming more and more draconian. soft capital controls have been put in place in the US and every year there are new restrictions, and it's clear the situation is much worse in the EU with all the NIRP garbage.
it is pretty clear to me that the notion of a centrally planned economy is coming to the end of the road. whenever the economy is doing badly, the central planners just start turning dials to fix the short term problem, e.g. drop the federal funds rate by 5%, with little regard for the longer term consequences of those dial turnings. each time the dials are turned to get the economy moving again, it creates a credit bubble which is guaranteed to implode later on and cause yet another economic contraction.
most elected officials just need things to work for their term in office and don't give a fuck about what happens 5-10 years later. bitcoin or any other CC that has a finite supply may force states and their leadership to actually fix the underlying economic problems they have instead of blowing another credit bubble and kicking the can down the road.

there's no telling how much of the volume is fake or not. a single person with a relatively small amount of money can run a very active bot that generates tons of volume but makes or loses very little money. similarly, the exchange itself or related entities are likely running their own bots, so "volume" is not a very good metric for actual activity or interest in bitcoin or any other product.

interesting to see your comment downvoted. i think that if the block size is not increased soon, the fees required to have a transaction confirm in 1 block will go up quite a bit. i suspect this is not such a bad thing, but it may have surprising effects on the value of bitcoin (positive or negative, i'm not sure).
if the maximum size is left as-is, spam will likely become 'expensive' due to increasing tx fees to get it into the next block. if nothing else, it would be interesting to see how block size scarcity affects blockchain spam.
the notion of filtering spam tx is a slippery slope and must be approached with caution.

I am not a fan of FATCA, since it basically amounts to capital controls on the USD.  It also puts the onus for enforcement on the banks, which is what prevents most US businesses that want to start an exchange from operating.
I run a payment processing service, [Coinvoice]( that processes invoices denominated and paid in USD into BTC.  This means that it entirely avoids FATCA by processing invoices into BTC before they leave the US.  This may be of interest to those of you that have offshore businesses that do business with US entities, e.g. IP licensing, commission sales.

the thing that stands out the most about your post is calling coinbase out for what it is: a centralized bank-like system that carries serious liabilities. why they are not considered a money transmitter when they offer what are obviously stored value certificates, i.e. an account with their site, has never made any sense to me. i guess if you have enough VC funding you can run roughshod over the law...

* exchange activity records (i.e. the leaked data)
* any cold storage activity and
* their operational bank account(s)
would surely show interesting results.
a reconcile of their various accounts, not just data possibly leaked from one of these accounts (trading activity), would answer questions like
* were funds diverted from or go missing from cold storage, and if so when? even better, it should be possible to track these utxos that went 'missing'.
* does the trading activity reconcile properly or are funds shown as missing from that account as well?
* was fiat siphoned out of a bank account without a corresponding trading history?
i sure hope jespow et al can deliver data like this. at a minimum, those of us who lost funds in mtgox deserve to know where the hell it all went.

As omnibrain noted in his edit, there is no restriction on the nationality of the recipient, e.g. recipient can be an entity or individual in Brazil, Switzerland, Anguilla, Nevis, etc.
The only caveat is that payment for invoices must be sent in USD, instead of EUR, GBP, etc. This is most convenient to do with US-sourced payments, but it can work with payments from customers located anywhere, e.g. customer in Japan pays invoice via USD wire transfer for a Indian merchant.

good advice, but i have some reservations after reading jason's response. while jason may well be telling the truth, this story raises some obvious questions for me.
if the donated BTC were either spent directly as BTC or converted into USD, there should be exchange account records, bank statements or on-chain transactions for payments. that none of this was volunteered or used to do any accounting is very suspicious, imo.
jason, can you use any of the types of records above to substantiate that your charitable activities are indeed of the scale you claim? from the outside, it's very easy for someone to claim "i fed 100K meals to the homeless" when the reality is "i fed 10K meals to the homeless and blew the rest of the money at a casino".

i have dealt with a lot of bankers at a lot of banks at a lot of branches and the variance you find in how personal/business bankers behave is very large. i have noticed that something as seemingly minor as the particular employee you get at a branch can make all the difference when opening accounts or performing routine activities at the bank, e.g. making wire transfers.
this AML/KYC mess you experienced could be chase being shitty, but it could very well be that particular banker you worked with. i have had similar experiences to what you describe and pushed back during the account setup, only to close the account later because the service there was shit.

If you're a VE resident or citizen and you sell goods or services to clients outside VE, you can bill them using Coinvoice, with the bill denominated in USD.  Your clients can pay using USD wire transfer, then Coinvoice sends you BTC using the current rate from Bitstamp.  It allows your customers to avoid using BTC themselves, while you receive BTC, circumventing the VE capital controls that would typically force you to convert to VEF (Venezuelan bolivar).

while in this case it appears there was some sort of blackmail or fraud, there are several other rather serious allegations that have been levelled at pierce over the years. for example, pitchbend below refers to trouble in Spain in which pierce was involved.
while this one case appears to be seriously trumped up and likely the result of "legal" blackmail, there are several other instances where pierce has been shockingly proximal to or outright accused of performing sexual acts with minors. additionally, for a former business partner (debonneville) to bring suit against him while retaining sidley austin, accusing him of all sorts of legally questionable behavior on the corporate front, there has to be a lot of shady going on.

not exactly happy to see more FUD and muddied waters from you midmagic. if you want to talk about ego, have a look at the dev methodology for the core devs.
the "strife" is the only way to get the core team to listen and do sane stuff like revert or kill getutxos. note that the problems were called out shortly after going into master when we could have easily withheld the bugs until they made it into a release.
the trouble with so many open source projects is that there is no real payout. with bitcoin, all the early investors/adopters have effectively already been paid out, which, imo, makes it very unique in terms of open source projects.

i fail to see how making observations amounts to having a hate-on or decrying behavior as evil. your further comment "it's the only reasonable response to the stakes involved" only goes to support the fourth bullet you cite.
citations and further explanation were omitted in the interest of keeping the entry of reasonable length. i'll give a short explanation of each of these points:


since the Bitcoin protocol is defined by whatever the reference implementation does, that is all that matters. imo it would be fair to not even refer to a Bitcoin protocol since there is little about it that is protocol-like. once consensus is reached amongst the ~5 core devs and it passes the "miners won't go apeshit" test, it's very likely going to be part of the "protocol".


we have experienced this as an alternative implementation in that core devs say that diversity is healthy, but all their behavior indicates they feel otherwise. i have witnessed similar behavior in the context of altcoins.


it was actually this very problem that we first encountered when attempting to get bitcoind + bitcoin-qt running on openbsd. i employ a number of talented devs and we wanted to get bitcoind running on openbsd and we encountered indifference and outright hostility from the core devs. rather than try to engage us and have us assist in porting code, they just wanted to tell us how stupid we were.

the "free market" means that participation from more establishment types is inevitable. they, just like everyone else starting a business that involves BTC, are looking for an edge and have a big ol pile of money and strong links to the existing established financial order. they are going to leverage these links to their advantage and try to make money, nothing at all surprising about this.

i think your idea of retargeting the maximum block size is a fine idea. someone manually setting a semi-arbitrary knob every so often seems like a really poor solution.


i find gavin's comment here a bit odd considering that he is working on iblt, which goes a long way to solving the issues with block propagation time for larger blocks. given, this work is not complete, but i would be surprised if it was not done before the end of 2015.
i don't think it's a reasonable expectation that an automated retargeting maximum block size would suddenly surge to something over 20 MB before the block propagation problem is alleviated.
the retargeting that occurs with difficulty allows for the hands-free operation of bitcoin. i see maximum block size as a very similar situation. sure, there are caveats, but someone manually turning a dial when they feel like it is a non-solution.

it is easy to mistake a system of perceived value for a ponzi scheme or vice versa.
it is relatively common for US businesses, sometimes very large or ubiquitous ones, to have very little actual value and operate on the basis of perceived value. there are plenty of "legitimate" US businesses that, imo, have nearly zero actual value but have a very high perceived value, e.g. Facebook or Groupon. i don't consider these to be outright ponzi schemes but they sure share a lot of characteristics: they need an influx of new money to cover losses on old money. outright ponzi schemes are relatively rare and i feel that the difference between a publicly held company with nearly zero revenue and a prpper ponzi can be very minor.
in the case of currency, nearly every system in public use within the past few hundred years has been fundamentally without value, e.g. printed paper notes, alloy-coated zinc, seashells, etc. a couple important features that drive value to a currency are (A) fungibility and (B) perceived value. bitcoin started with (A) but (B) only happened once a sufficiently large audience perceived that value and created demand. bitcoin is like every other valued currency in that there is a consensus that it is valuable.
trying to distinguish between ponzis and non-ponzis is not a very useful distinction since it is often the case that society assigns value on the basis of perception.

hi there yanni. as someone who offers payment processing services with bitcoin, i have a bit of perspective here.
my read is that your service is, in no uncertain terms, a money transmitter. when paying the IRS, the funds are not being transmitted in connection with an exchange of goods or services, which means that not only is your business engaging in money transmission, you have induced bitpay, coinbase or whoever you process through to be involved in money transmission. neither bitpay or coinbase are registered as money transmitters last i checked, so i expect they will not be amused once they become aware of your activities. coinbase seems to do many things that qualify as operating as a money transmitter without the registration and i suspect they would be less agitated about it than bitpay.
whether snapcard processing payments through bitpay or coinbase for goods and services is money transmission is more of a grey area. however, the system you describe for paying the IRS is **definitely** money transmission.

it's not a question of you personally vouching that you feed these people since that is nearly impossible to actually verify, it's a question of whether or not you can substantiate your expenditures, e.g. how much food was bought when from where not a list of who was fed.
if you are indeed claiming these funds as income to a business, you need to account for all your expenditures/expenses with the IRS or else you have to pay tax on all the donations since they are considered income. again, stating "we have spent more than we have received in donations" is not giving any visibility into the accounting for how donations were spent.

i am really surprised how many people are seriously defending US bonds as _not_ a ponzi scheme, especially in this subreddit. you can argue about where the funds come from, what it's backed by, etc, but both bitcoin and US bonds suffer from the same fundamental problem: they need a steady influx of liquidity in order to stabilize or increase the price.
the scale of the USD as a ponzi scheme is far greater than that of BTC. if people stop using USD for transactions and as a store of value, its value will certainly decrease, just like BTC.  US bonds are just one facet of the USD economy and i think it's more appropriate to call the USD economy a ponzi instead of just US bonds. in the case of BTC, it is an equity based network that is based mainly on the intrinsic value of Bitcoin as a technology, and has less to do with ongoing policies and practices. on the other hand, the USD has value because the Fed tunes it to have value via interest rates, bond issuances, printing money, etc. there is an enormous amount of sleight-of-hand involved with ensuring the USD continues to have "value", which is far more ponzi-like than BTC imo.
in the case BTC crashes to zero, it's a bunch of value that was first created and then destroyed which should be a zero-sum game (unless you're mtgox). if the USD crashes to zero, there are an endless string of large ticket projects and assets that are nigh impossible to actually pay for. in fact, even without a USD crash, the USG has a hard time paying interest on its debts and not spending money it doesn't have. based on these failure modes, which of USD and BTC sounds more like a ponzi?

what you might notice is that their explanation about BBB is particularly jargon-rich, which is often a sign that something is amiss considering the rest of the site has easily understood language.
playak's point is spot-on - the BBB method will quote you the BTC-E price because the price is consistently 1% below Bitstamp and thus the "best bid". that means BitPay offers merchants' customers a price that is 1% below Bitstamp, allowing them to immediately sell BTC on Bitstamp to lock in ~1% profit.  in the case of very large invoice, the BBB will be somewhere between 0% and 1% below Bitstamp since BTC-E doesn't have very deep liquidity.
the way people are charged "0%" is that instead of merchants paying the processing fees, the **customers** are given a below-market rate on their bitcoins, effectively pushing the processing fee onto the customer instead of the merchant. i think this is pretty dishonest, but it's pretty typical for large VC-backed companies to play some version of the classic "ball and cup" game.

let's assume that your claim about credit card companies giving all kinds of info to banks is true. having banked many places, i highly doubt that information is used by the banks to derive actionable information about any given customer.
while i use bitstamp and have been happy with their service to date, the level of KYC/AML probing claimed by a few redditors is beyond _anything_ i have ever seen at any bank. i've had more than one account closed on me in my day, so i'm pretty familiar with how deep these questions go when dealing with banks.
KYC/AML with banks usually stops at the point where they ask you to describe how you sourced the funds, you give a several sentence explanation, and it's either good enough and they drop it or they don't like your answer and close the account.

[Coinvoice]( is a great way to process USD payments into BTC for merchants.  It works well with inbound USD wire transfer payment for invoices.
However, you have specifically addressed instant methods of USD payment, e.g. PayPal or other credit card processing, and these methods come along with serious risk for the payment processor.  The reason Coinvoice and others do not process such transactions is there is significant chargeback risk, and it's from the merchant's **customers** not the merchant itself.  If you've ever been involved in a PayPal or other credit card chargeback dispute, you know what I'm talking about.  Beyond the financial risks associated with chargebacks for the payment processor, there is a substantial risk of losing the merchant account being used to process these payments.  If your account gets more than 0.5-1.0% chargebacks by total processed or count of transactions, you are very likely to lose your merchant account and have a difficult time getting a new one.

it's very funny to see this since a friend of mine saw something very similar happen to him while trading spot EUR/USD on some forex platform (can't recall which) ~8 years ago. he was riding a serious downtrend in EUR/USD and had a large short on, so he was making a lot of money as the downturn continued. he had a very loose trailing stop set on the position, so loose that the trailing stop was well above the price where the trend started. once he was up over USD 20K on the position, the price "spiked" to just above where his trailing stop was set, triggering the stop.
there was basically nothing he could do and the funds were lost. there are lots of shady ppl in the secondary forex trading markets.

civil asset forfeiture is one of the most terrible parts of the US legal system. it does effectively make one guilty until proven innocent.
the justification for civil asset forfeiture ("CAF") is that organized criminal kingpins can use their funds to avoid the sentences they "deserve" by spending big on their legal defence. the sad part about this justification is that it is an open admission that the justice system is entirely broken in the US, so the "only" solution is to completely trample the rights of the individual being charged with the crime.
bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies more generally, make seizing the assets of a suspect much harder, rendering CAF a much weaker tool in the fight against supposed badguys. i consider this a huge win for personal liberty and it goes a fair way to restoring some level of balance in the current police state that is the US.

it has everything to do with bitcoin: BTC payments are irreversible. processing from credit cards to BTC means customers can (often fraudulently) chargeback when you've already paid out the BTC to the merchant. the only way to mitigate this is with rolling reserves, which is one more mess to manage on top of a shaky merchant account relationship.

the trouble is that it's not just a matter of charging an appropriate markup: you will lose your merchant account once chargebacks account for 0.5-1.0% of your processing volume. on top of that, i expect it's very tough to get a merchant account when you openly tell them it will be used as a means to payout BTC.
banks and credit card companies make it super difficult to run any business that sees even high-ish, e.g. 0.4%, chargeback rates.

the reason most people and yourself have not done a chargeback is they are most often used by scammers and fraudsters themselves. sometimes chargebacks are legit, e.g. person has their CC and person info stolen, but this is relatively rare.
having seen it first-hand myself, what is far more common on e-commerce sites is that the ppl doing the chargebacks are themselves the perpetrators of fraud. rings of fraudsters will commonly look for weak points in your anti-fraud measures, rack up a number of expensive orders then claim it was fraudulent activity.

I run a payment processing service, [Coinvoice]( that allows offshore merchants to invoice in USD and receive payout in BTC.

something to keep in mind about the "War on Drugs" in the US - it acts as a macroeconomic mechanism to export USD to other countries. the WoD drives up drug prices, which greatly increases the amount of USD exported.

while i have no reason to doubt that theymos is a fair admin/mod, it is abundantly clear to anyone who has spent time interacting with the bitcoin community that it is far more centralized than one would have expected from a decentralized cryptocurrency:
roughly 3 people are responsible for all the changes to the core code, the bulk of the BTC/fiat exchange volume routes through only a few exchanges, and one guy is in charge of the subreddit and forum.
the tactics used to preserve this centralization are predictable and reminiscent of those used in any other normal hierarchy. while i think theymos has a decent point in saying "If you think that you can do better, try competing instead of complaining.", this is a classic strawman argument for centralized figureheads. when you are the first mover, there is very little likelihood someone can "do it better", especially once you're entrenched.

IMO, the most substantive argument to make against the banning of Bitcoin in Russia is that Russia's failure to facilitate widespread use of the ruble in the 2nd half of the 20th century played a significant role in the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989.  By banning Bitcoin, Russia stands to cut itself off from a major source of global liquidity and will deprive its citizens of the opportunity to benefit from cryptocurrencies.  While this may, in the short term, benefit the Russian government in the sense that it has more control over the finances of its citizens, in the long term it will be a major loss.  Additionally, assuming the ban occurs, creative/wealthy Russians will simply offshore and work through agents and nominees to hold cryptocurrencies.
If those points aren't enough, consider that China has not banned Bitcoin and appears to be cautiously encouraging its use.

everything about this situation suggests an insider theft, likely by MK himself:
* Japanese law enforcement was not involved from early on despite claims of there being a multi hundred million USD theft.
* No accounting of the missing BTC has been made public. As we are all aware, it should be relatively trivial to track down the addresses to which these funds have been sent.
* MtGox has issued numerous statements that "muddy the waters", a classic technique for obfuscating what actually happened.
* MK wore a strange smile when publicly stating that all the funds had been lost on Japanese television.  Losing hundreds of millions of USD from your customers is nothing to smile about.
I have heard the claim from people who know MK that he is not the kind of guy who would ever steal customer funds. It is typical for financial criminals to deceive those closest to them most deeply.

while this is an interesting insight by someone on the cypherpunks mailing list, it is only part of the core insight required to make bitcoin work.
the 2 key insights for bitcoin are
* (1) a distributed database to prevent double spends
* (2) a method for creating a distributed timestamp to ensure consensus on transaction times
proof-of-work (PoW) fulfills (2) but is not mentioned, so this person only shared "half" the formula. tying PoW into the minting algorithm is a solution that aligns incentives nicely, but even a minting algorithm that randomly allocates coins would have been acceptable.

many first-world countries have laws about issuing securities to their citizens, irrespective of where the company seeking investment is domiciled. the argument that a cryptocurrency does not constitute a security and is outside the regulation of the SEC could hold some water, but it is a risky proposition.
i expect this is the tip of the iceberg in terms of securities violations in the context of CCs. maidsafe and others that did a "backdoor IPO" should be worried.
there is a reason that Bitcoin had its mining/minting algorithm act the way it did: it explicitly avoids being considered a security by not having a counterparty in the issuance, i.e. the Bitcoin network issues block rewards, not some company.

This shouldn't be very surprising - Silicon Valley Bank, the bank that Coinbase and a few other VC-backed BTC businesses use, has stated that they are not accepting any new BTC business accounts in the recent past.  I recall them saying something (sorry, don't have link handy) roughly equivalent to "we are already plenty busy with compliance work for our existing (large) BTC business accounts and we're not looking for any new ones".
The strategy amongst banks seems to be to freeze out new BTC businesses and tell the potential customers some bullshit about "Bitcoin is so new, we can't comply with the regulations". Welcome to the world of banking soft regulation where there is absolutely nothing illegal about your business but you cannot get a bank account.

there is more to parsing large blocks than just signature verifications. javed khan (tuxcanfly on GH) did some of the initial work to get btcsim working with bitcoind. i would be interested to see how the core client performs with very large blocks. a raw number on a website can't reproduce the complexities of actually simulating large blocks.
sipa's libsecp256k1 is definitely fast, but it's almost all in assembly, which makes reviewing/auditing it difficult.
a better question would be "where does the core client max out?", rather than asking "why does btcd max out at 200 tps?"

(1) this email with this exact language is sent to any PP user whose goods or services violate PP's terms and conditions. it may cite cryptocurrency-related products here, but it is a standard form letter of theirs, just swap the items cited with other ones specifically called out on their blacklist.
(2) as a payment processor, you want to avoid chargebacks: they are costly to perform and everyone on the banking side of payment processing, e.g. bank underwriters, views them negatively. the BFL scam obviously triggered a ton of PP chargebacks, which may have prompted PP's bank(s) to make demands of their own after seeing the avalanche of chargebacks.  similarly, you can imagine that compromised PP accounts or accounts of scammers can cause issues when used to buy cryptocurrencies: it is directly at odds with PP's historically customer-friendly chargeback policies.

i find it patently amusing how VC-backed businesses' "valuations" are typically based on number of users instead of anything concrete from a financial perspective.
while you may consider bitcoin to be a bubble, i would argue that it actually has value far beyond anything offered by facebook, whatsapp or any other moron-centric software business. what do facebook and whatsapp offer me in terms of value? one is a big forum ***with pictures*** and the other is a text communications protocol ***that you can use from your phone***, we're clearly talking about highly valuable revolutionary ideas here. bitcoin, on the other hand, is a value storage and transfer system that allows me to entirely avoid banks and other no-value financial intermediaries and send funds anywhere on the planet. it's pretty clear that bitcoin is woefully ***under***valued.
i think the comparison of bitcoin to these stupid VC-backed non-technologies is totally fair. unfortunately, with bitcoin, there is no trusted 3rd party who can be bought and sold to artificially inflate the value of the network before it is sold off to giant company X or dumdum mutual funds.

you carefully avoid the point, but many people talk about "Bitcoin the protocol" when it plainly does not exist. you surely know this, i know this and minority of the rest know it.
when there is no **protocol**, we and anyone else who wants to make a full node implementation must "slavishly copy" bitcoind. it is more than a bit ridiculous that a network with a market capitalization in the billions of USD does not have a proper protocol.
i suggest you take a look at the commit messages and changelog yourself: there are a lot of things in the bitcoind changelog that are near identical to code already committed to btcd and btcwallet. this is not a coincidence and we have received **zero** accreditation for this, despite other implementations getting recognition for various things ported from them.

i see this recent "war on cash", especially in the US, as a sign that the Fed (FRB) may try to reverse course on their perma-delayed rate hike from the federal funds rate of 0.25%. a rate hike will likely spur a wave of defaults and drive down real estate prices, potentially creating a collapse.
the act of effectively banning cash will allow the FRB to do exactly what the ECB is already doing with NIRP - have an effective "tax" on "cash" bank deposits. this allows banks to recapitalize themselves while avoiding a wave of balance-sheet-crushing defaults.
needless to say, cryptocurrencies throw a rather large monkey wrench in this plan.

there are already lots of effective ways to hurt the bitcoin network but few people are taking the time to do it. frankly, i'm kind of surprised at that.
sure, there **could** be problems, but just look at the current situation with the BC devs all making their own arguments. this is a huge waste of human energy arguing about turning just 1 knob. if nothing else, all this wasted time should demonstrate that having a knob that is turned according to a group or individual's whims is a bad thing.
on a more long-term note, irresponsible people with their hands on the knobs is exactly what has gotten most central banks into trouble: the local govt will always push to have those knobs turned to suit its own short-term plans.
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:00:10
i don't see why there is all this arguing over knob settings.
one of the most brilliant things about bitcoin is its **lack** of knobs. instead of a group arbitrarily fiddling with the knobs on bitcoin, it would seem that having the maximum block size automatically retarget would be most in keeping the spirit of bitcoin, similar to the way difficulty adjusts, albeit with different criteria.
the reason central banks have painted themselves into a corner is they cannot keep their hands off the knobs. now they have no more parameter space to occupy due to excessive knob turning.
managing peoples' expectations is super important and algorithms are far better at that than any human.

the input utxo selection rules for every wallet i'm aware of don't take privacy into much consideration.
not reusing addresses is a simple but not very effective means of triaging the privacy problems. doing proper merge avoidance means several things would have to change, e.g. recipient of a tx would need to supply a hardened extended pubkey so the sender can create as many destination addresses as there were inputs and sending each utxo separately.

the reason gold has value is because there is a **consensus that gold has value**. this consensus is shared by practically every central bank on the planet since they are all clamoring to repatriate their gold from abroad, especially the US. citibank, a propagator of fiat banking that is backed by absolutely nothing, hardly has a leg to stand on when talking shit.
central banks all clamoring to repatriate their gold is, to me, a definite sign of coming fiat instability.

perhaps this is an elaborate trap set by a jaded dev to troll grubhub into accepting bitcoin.

while i suspect that their site may be (entirely?) custom-built, i have found that adding bitcoin payment support to existing e-commerce software is **extremely** easy. compared to adding support for credit cards, it is a total breeze. you can typically have payment processing working in a matter of 1-2 days vs several weeks when setting up credit card processing, there is practically zero risk of fraud and it saves ~2% in processing fees.

actually, i have discussed the mtgox issue with a japanese friend of mine and understanding the police in japan is indeed a complex matter. some points to consider about the police in japan:
* many japanese regard the police as yet-another-gang, similar to the yakuza, albeit backed by direct government authority
* it is typical for the police to be involved in prostitution rings
* the police only charge suspects with crimes when they feel extremely (read &gt;90%) confident they can get a conviction. if the police cannot readily determine who murdered someone, a case will be considered an "accidental death" or similar.
with this in mind, MK could have simply escaped the wrath of the police based on there not being enough evidence for them to bring charges and convict with &gt;90% probability. a less likely possibility is that he bribed the police, possibly indirectly, with the stolen funds.
in any case, i think it makes japanese law enforcement look unbelievably stupid when MK can have all this happen and not even publicly account for the BTC that was stolen. this is practically an invitation for criminal use of BTC in japan.

if OK CN and/or OK SG are indeed solvent, i think at this point they have a pretty simple decision:
(A) attempt to settle with Roger or one of his entities that is the counterparty to this contract to be released from the contract, which would likely cost roughly USD 100,000-200,000, based on the comments made in the correspondence.
(B) take the dispute to court in SG and likely lose to Roger.
while i understand this kind of shenanigans may be the norm in CN, once you setup entities in other jurisdictions, you have to play by **their** rules. i suspect SG will not abide by this kind of behavior and that would be reflected in a court ruling.
this is a PR disaster for OK CN and OK SG, so in the end, all this sketchy behavior will likely cost them far more in lost revenue due to customers not using their exchanges than the amount Roger was attempting to recover to release them from the contract. the longer this dispute is a "headline" to the bitcoin community, the more revenue they are likely to lose.

i think you guys have missed a fundamental point about how gaming in NV works: it is essentially a state-sanctioned money laundering operation. gambling provides an opportunity for someone to lose and someone to win, and the naive observers think this is about some kind of skill, be it reading other players or gaming the odds. the real purpose of casinos in NV and many other places is to launder money for organized crime outfits by having people come in with cash and "lose" it to someone who was preordained to "win".
the state of NV has turned this industry into a big source of revenue and jobs. the regulators "regulate" and prevent the casinos from using machines that outright steal money, and all the staff serve to create chaff with the naive gamblers while the real business goes on elsewhere in the casino.
bitcoin and online gambling is a huge threat to this glove-in-hand system that NV has setup.

it's not typical for anyone who runs a private business to give full disclosure on the compromise of their computer systems. by disclosing attack details, they give clues to would-be attackers and make it easier to reproduce such an attack elsewhere. while bitstamp is certainly an important component of the bitcoin economy, it is also a private business and has zero obligation to give details on a successful hack. 
i expect that further data will be released at some point. in some cases it's very difficult to determine exactly how someone gained access without full traffic dumps of your uplink. it could also be that the network was infiltrated via an unmonitored side channel.
based on the amount of funds they escaped with, they seem to have cleaned out bitstamp's hot wallet(s). some software running on the wallet or rest of their site got exploited, leading to access to the hot wallet.

if you're really keen on having 0% processing fees, realize that the only way to achieve that is to speculate and trade against the order book coming from orders being processed. this basically means that BTC payment processors are being forced into behaving like big banks: they take your money and then "go to the casino" with it since it's the only way to make the scheme work.
instead of paying a 1% processing fee, which is very small compared to any CC processing out there, you can get 0% in exchange for the payment processor exposing themselves and you to systemic risks. i would gladly pay 1% to someone who processes my payments if it means less exposure to systemic risks.

if golang works on your pi, you should be able to get it installed pretty easily. however, there are a couple caveats:
* btcd's db maintains a tx index, which is optional with bitcoind, and this creates a pretty heavy disk i/o pattern. if you are running on a usb/cf/sd drive, it may struggle with the i/o. i recommend having a hard drive with platters or an ssd.
* importing blockchain.dat or syncing up to the last checkpoint uses about 1 cpu on a modern desktop, and up to 6 cpus verifying the chain past the last checkpoint. this may be a bottleneck on the chain sync speed.

one of the crappy parts about running a business is that if you're not careful who has authority to legally bind a company in the context of contracts, you can acquire some very nasty problems with counterparties. all of this seems to hinge on a signature from CZ acting as CTO of OKC SG being binding for OKC SG. i'm not familiar with C-corp style rules, but what if CZ didn't have authority to bind OKC SG in contracts, e.g. the bylaws only grant authority to bind to the CEO and not the other officer positions?

interesting comment, but my opinion is that only very complex smart contracts will require such auditing. enough smart contracts will be public that over time there will be certain canonical contracts or contract components that become reliable and openly available. if you're trying to cook up something very complex and non-standard, that is where you will need auditing.
there will surely be plenty more missteps, like the dao, before there are "fire tested" smart contracts out there.

if you've ever had trouble with a bank account before, you have already learned a painful lesson with banks: it is not your money, you are a creditor of the bank and if you upset them, they are not required to give you access to your funds, e.g. they can restrict or freeze the funds despite you having done nothing illegal.
this observation and a handful of others are why, imo, the legacy banking system is doomed. "funds" in a bank account are just numbers on a screen and, under the wrong circumstances, do not correlate to any hard obligation on part of the bank.

bitcoin has serious problems in that it lacks a stable governance model, and i've [blogged about this in the past](
in terms of what is encoded into the consensus rules, the only parties in bitcoin who have any formal sovereignty are the PoW miners, the vast majority of whom reside in CN with warehouses of ASICs powered by near-free electricity. from an implementation perspective, the devs, referring to Bitcoin Core / Blockstream, have all the control since their software powers the bulk of the p2p network, with the PoW miners being an especially important part of that. despite these 2 control mechanisms that bitcoin has, the cost of making a contentious hardfork is actually quite low, which makes hardforking dangerous in that it could lead to bitcoin splitting into multiple chains.
i was fed up with the politics of this situation and decided to create an altcoin to fix these serious structural problems with bitcoin's governance, it's called [decred]( that said, i have no idea if these governance problems with bitcoin are even fixable, especially in light of the centralization of power with the BC/BS devs and the PoW miners.

bitcoin transactions are mostly pay to pubkey hash (P2PKH), meaning that until you spent that utxo, you don't reveal the pubkey, only the hash of the pubkey.
this means that if you have sent to a fresh address, there is only a public record of the hash of the pubkey, not the pubkey itself. if you don't have the pubkey, it's far harder to brute force.

modern fractional reserve banking is a "soft" form of slavery: you pay interest to borrow money that doesn't exist, and nearly everyone in society insists you "need" to borrow this money. this process of borrowing money that doesn't exist to buy stuff you "need" drives up the price of various assets, e.g. property, education, healthcare, since everyone is buying them with nonexistent money.
so everything is more expensive than it should be and you're stuck paying interest to someone who can make money appear out of thin air. sounds like a really great system :-P

your rather amusing troll aside, i do think that a large scale news/opinion site is a perfect target for "blockchainization":
* news/opinion sites are trusted 3rd parties
* once they get sufficiently popular, they are ripe targets for intel/govt manipulation/censorship via coercion of the 3rd party
* the amount of data being shared is, relatively speaking, small, e.g. lots of text posts and some simple stats
that's not to say that everything is easily "blockchainized" - if the data in a blockchain is too large, it doesn't make sense to replicate it so many times across so many nodes.

get a real exchange account at a non-US exchange and you'll have a much easier time acquiring bitcoin. other countries besides the US are not hell-bent on making their customers feel like they are committing a crime by converting their US funnybucks to bitcoin. using a non-US exchange typically involves an international wire transfer, but assuming you can tolerate that, it's way less invasive than what you have described.

if you're concerned about the nsa et al using a qc to steal your btc, you can do 2 things:
* do not reuse addresses - by only using each address once, you make it very difficult to brute force a private key from a public one. the only opportunity to do this is the time between a utxo being spent and mined, which is typically 10s of minutes.
* spread out your bitcoins across many utxos - if the value of brute forcing each keypair is low, you can make it effectively too expensive to brute force your keys.

overall it was definitely a good article.
however, the use of the term "community" here seems to only apply to the engineering side of the equation. the entire Bitcoin community is composed of users, investors, service companies, etc, and not just engineers. engineers are a very important component of the community, but by no means the only part. i consider Bitcoin's most severe problem to be that everyone besides miners and BC developers has effectively zero representation, e.g. you can own tons of coins or run a giant business that is really important to the ecosystem and be entirely ignored by BC or the miners.
it seems inconsistent to state "Bitcoin is an open project, with a sometimes-inefficient-but-open community process that always pushes for the fundamentals of decentralization, robustness, and innovation" and then make the observation that the development is very centralized, like BGP dev used to be. you sure can't fire a community, and BC is by no means "the community".

while i think a trezor certainly improves the security of your private key(s) over many other storage options, this is a **very** misleading and inaccurate statement.
the same way that accessing a computer using its usb ports can compromise the machine at a low level, e.g. BIOS, firmware or memory, a computer can compromise a usb device, e.g. overwrite the firmware. a trezor cannot stop these attacks that are based on the usb standard.
further, there are various attacks that can read machine instructions off remote circuits/cpus, which bleeds private key bits.

although i'm glad to see the dev work more reliably funded, i'm also becoming more and more concerned about the future of bitcoin development. pretty much the entire BC group is now funded by (1) blockstream, which is backed by an outfit of VC investors and (2) MIT, whose currency initiative is headed by a former white house advisor. these may both be very good things for the value and acceptance of bitcoin, but it really does bring into question the extent to which the devs are independent of VC money and USG influence.
i know that not everyone in the VC and USG world has a hidden agenda, however, the typical behavior from these groups is (1) VCs care about the shortest path to money, and that's pretty much all they care about and (2) the USG is preoccupied with exercising its dominance, whether militarily or otherwise, whenever possible.

in a privately-held company, a stock is someone's liability, namely the company's: it entitles you, the stockholder, to financial benefit from the company, often in the form of dividends. it also requires a trusted intermediary. in the case of a publicly traded company, the stock exchange acts as a trusted 3rd party.
the financial system of the 20th century has indoctrinated people to believe that tokens that carry value are assets, not liabilities. the point the OP was making is that pretty much every token that is considered an asset, e.g. cash, stocks, (non-physical) commodities, everything except hard physical assets like gold, is an "IOU" (i.e. debt). cash is an IOU from the central bank and stocks are an IOU from either the company or the stock market, meaning there is a debtor counterparty.

i just looked at the whitepaper summary and FBAS is an interesting approach: FBAS seems to use the notion of financial "locality" to create a consensus "globally". without looking deeper, it appears to be PoS on a per transaction basis on local coordinate patches.  this reminds me of fun with manifolds and coordinate patches back in school.
however, such a system creates serious problems in terms of censorship and fungibility. the ability to locally censor transactions makes this an absolute no-go, imo.

it is only in the past several decades that the ability to monitor all financial transactions and communications has been within the reach of various govts. however, most LE/intel agencies will argue "we need to see all the data all the time to prevent angry ahmed (or some other strawman) from destroying your freedom" despite human society having worked just fine for millenia without this persistent and pervasive spying.
what would happen if people had actual financial privacy that could not be trivially violated by govts? govts and their agents would need to do **actual investigatory work** to "get the badguys". finding the badguys is straightfoward using time-tested investigation techniques.

as someone who spent most of the years of their high school life studying to become a physicist (and ultimately bailing on it :) ), i could not agree with you more. the "clock" was a non-invention, and it was just plain stupid.
that this kid is being held up as an example of an innovative and hard-working aspiring scientist is fucking ridiculous. the only reason this is happening is that nobody wants to talk about the actual truth of the situation:
* the general US populace has been trained to falsely believe that every brown skinned person from a muslim state is a potential terrorist
* Texas is full of racists. if you disagree with me, you've probably never been to TX. note that this does not mean everyone in TX is a racist, just a whole lot of them
* the USG has created a police state where the default assumption is that invisible islamic badguys are hiding behind every corner waiting to blow up our freedom. that LE would isolate this kid and then attempt to coerce a confession is pretty unbelievable - he's fucking 14. how anyone could see that clock up close and accuse him of being affiliated with terrorism is beyond me.
so instead of reporting the truth, which is hard for idiots to stomach and makes the US look bad, the PR ppl have effectively sock-puppeted the discussion away from the truth.

here's how i interpret this information. keep in mind i could, of course, be wrong.
the NSA publicly stating that Suite B needs to be post-qc crypto is a sign that someone besides them is close to or has a qc. if the NSA already has a qc, as i have long suspected they do, you can rest assured they would never divulge this information and would happily use this tech to their private benefit. a qc combined with the ability to eavesdrop on pretty much anyone is a pretty powerful combination.
this Suite B update says, to me, that (1) the NSA already likely has post-qc crypto, likely in Suite A, (2) that one or more non-US govts are either close to a qc or already have one (guessing CN or RU) and (3) only now that products sold to the NSA et al could potentially be compromised by a foreign govts do they care about having vendors shore up their crypto.

if you are serious about computer security, you should never install 3rd party closed-source applications that give remote access to your machine. while open source software has its risks, e.g. missed bugs, they pale in comparison to the risks you take when using closed source software like teamviewer, logmein, etc.
if you handle any substantial amount of BTC on your machine, i would consider disabling all inbound remote access protocols to that machine. if you handle only smaller amounts of BTC on the machine, it's a correspondingly lesser risk you're taking.

it is typical for military and govt contractors to use EM-isolated COTS computer gear, e.g. a rack of Dell machines in a Faraday cage or similar. the use of EM isolation by these contractors (and govts directly) indicates, indirectly, that there are one or more attack vectors involving EM emissions from COTS gear. whether that corresponds to backdoors in the CPUs, i cannot say. however, if you're at all familiar with the process whereby Intel or other hardware makers protect information about their CPU "errata", you wouldn't be surprised to learn the USG has access to all kinds of information about how to take over your CPU.
i have heard several parties claim that certain USG agencies have their own duty-built hardware. whether it's better than COTS gear or not, i have no clue. if i did have a clue, i'd probably have a security clearance and not be allowed to talk about it :).

that you even suggest a "Bitcoin protocol" exists speaks to your lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works. there is no protocol, the BC devs have declared their codebase as the "protocol". code is not a protocol, but worry not, ppl will claim "it's so complicated it can't be put into a proper protocol document".
Julian41 is 100% correct that Blockstream's team can and does have the capability to change the Bitcoin "protocol", i.e. code. how they change is obviously another matter entirely, e.g. add CLTV, add block pruning, stall on increasing the block size.

good infosec is a matter of layering. while it is true that VM escape exploits exist and are crushing, consider the threat model for attacking someone running an OS without VM compartmentalization: the attacker finds a vulnerability in one of the target's applications and it leads to the immediate compromise of their entire OS. qubes forces an attacker to perform an attack of the form (application exploit) --&gt; (VM escape exploit) --&gt; (machine rooted), whereas they would normally only have to do (application exploit) --&gt; (machine rooted). this is strictly an improvement over the normal scenario.

this paper is misleading since it is not clear about its assumptions. if you take the time to read the paper, you will notice that they make a number of rather strong assumptions, effectively cherry-picking a scenario that has an alarmist outcome.
a very quick summary of their very strong assumptions:
* all nodes on the network are bitcoind instances that implement a defective anti-dos which can be 'trolled' over tor to blacklist tor exit nodes, which limits the nodes from which a user with tor can connect.
* user fingerprinting depends on an atypical behavior pattern with a full node - you use it over tor, then you use it without tor
* i believe some of the suggested countermeasures have been incorporated into bitcoin-core
while the paper makes some important points, i think it's mostly alarmist, similar to a paper from a while back claiming that "all encrypted voip traffic can be decrypted". in that paper they made the faulty assumption that you cannot run voip links over ipsec, which is complete bullshit.

good point.
another thing to consider is that a lot of the liquidity on exchanges comes from bots, not necessarily those run by the exchange itself. if you've ever setup an automated trading bot, you know that it takes a while to integrate the bot with the exchange's api. most exchanges have at least minor differences in how their apis work, and some have major differences. this low volume and thin order book is likely related to the fact that none of the bot developers have had time to integrate gemini's api yet.
expect to see a lot more volume once bot devs have had time to get their algos integrated with the api.

your observation that economics is not a hard science is spot on.
i knew a guy who was an economics phd student back in the day and his research was genuinely interesting (for the record, most things bore the hell out of me). however, since his research didn't demonstrate the adherence of some existing market to some existing theory, it didn't "fit" with what was expected of an economics professor, according to the circle jerk that is academia. as a result he could not get a professorship or a postdoc and had to go into private industry. now he is a successful anti-trust consultant who analyses hard data, a role where people appreciate his ability provide novel analysis of hard data.
having your data actually connect to the real world is not valued in the "field" of economics.

the funny part to me about RU's policy of banning or forbidding various opinions, actions, etc, is that it will end up creating the exact same situation that led to their economy imploding in 89.

this is exactly what happened with Operation Chokepoint - banks "de-risked" accounts for people involved with the adult film industry despite what they do being totally legal. this soft regulation at the bank garbage is more common than most people realize and it applies to a variety of industries, not just adult film.
the banks always spin this as "we're trying to be compliant!" and it's complete bullshit. it has nothing to do with compliance and everything to do with soft regulation from inside the bank on customers that don't fit into their cookie cutter image of what constitutes an ideal customer.

while i definitely agree with your overall point, the reasoning is a bit shaky on several of your points.
more succinctly:
* modern fractional reserve banking is essentially a form of slavery because everyone who takes loans from a bank is paying interest on money that never existed in the first place. this is effected via banks' ability to loan out some multiple of the amount they keep on deposit with the central bank, i.e. money that does not exist is conjured up and loaned to you, with interest, of course.
* inflation is a necessary consequence of the concept of interest: one cannot have money gradually grow when loaned without a steady flow of new money. this has all sorts of (negative) secondary effects.
* saving is actively discouraged by merit of inflation eating away at any balances you keep with a bank. the only way to do better than inflation is to give someone else your money, which empowers the investors who control your money and strips you of power because you are, yet again, a creditor.
* the act of taking out loans from banks serves to drive up the prices of assets since everyone now has a supply of money that never existed. this is the process whereby asset bubbles are created, e.g. everyone takes out a loan, everyone buys some shit they don't need, the price surges, then eventually the value of the asset collapses once people get worried about their shaky investment. this applies to housing, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.
* once the value collapses, banks swoop in and repossess said assets. this is the last step of a boom-bust cycle where the banks take ownership of real physical assets. it is accompanied by much groaning and "oh no, our balance sheet looks like shit, our stock value is going down" on part of the bank. however, since the money they loaned you never existed in the first place, the bank has effectively ball-and-cup'ed your funds and your physical assets away from you. you are now a slave to the bank **and** they have your property.
what a great little system :-/

have you considered that bitcoin is likely intelligence-service-built technology that is a backup plan in the scenario of central banking's collapse?
per recent events, banks and governments are preparing for the next wave of credit bubbles in the fiat banking system using bail-ins instead of bail-outs (think cyprus). when depositors/creditors of banks finally feel the pain from their bank systematically mismanaging their funds, e.g. take a 20% haircut on all your deposits and assets, things are going to get real interesting.

you can rest assured there is a whole team of people working on behalf of the USG/NSA/etc to steer the public dialogue on the topic of the snowden leak. people trying to steer a public dialogue have a relatively small bag of tricks, so it's entirely unsurprising to see the "focus on snowden, the individual" strategy being run to distract from "focus on the leaked information".

you need to become familiar with the details of the laws in your particular (US?) state to understand the details of how this works. there is a huge amount of variation in the laws from state to state in the US. if your or your spouse's assets are substantial, it's typical to get a prenuptial agreement prepared and signed.

the reason people are upset about this is that LEOs are typically not held accountable in the US, whether that means not being charged, not being prosecuted or not being sentenced in accordance with their violations of the law.
in the sense that the judge doled out what the prosecution requested, it was a "long sentence". however, i think most of us realize this is a strawman argument because it's obvious the prosecution asked for a substantially shorter sentence than they would have for "the rest of us".

the hard part about chat logs is that it's typically impossible to prove anyone wrote them. even if you find text files on my computer, how can you "prove" to someone else that i actually composed them? how is it possible to prove that text procured in a court was actually composed by a given person? short of PGP signed messages, it's rather hard to demonstrate this conclusively.
EDIT: it's also very interesting that redandwhite (presumably an undercover LEO) is "having trouble" getting OTR chat setup. it's like he knows those chats are built to be deniable ;)
EDIT2: even if messages are PGP-signed, it is easy enough to forge them provided you have access to the private key of the person in question, e.g. after you seized their laptop.

nice post vitalik.
the TLDR of quantum computing
(1) don't reuse addresses, ever, for any reason - using any address twice means the public is public and can be attacked, whereas a single-use address requires first determining your pubkey from the sha256 of said pubkey, a non-trivial task.
(2) spread out your utxos across many addresses - by having a single address with a large amount of btc, you reduce the cost of attacking your funds substantially. by spreading out your btc across many addresses, you linearly increase the cost of such an attack.
if quantum computers exist, e.g. USG has developed them in secret somewhere underground, they are likely expensive to maintain and run, so the advice given above will help to make your btc prohibitively expensive to attack.

the issue i see with zero conf attacks is that they'd be very expensive and difficult to execute, especially if the inputs came from several addresses. the privkeys would need to be generated before there was 1 confirmation, so in less than an hour in most cases.
i do understand that if a sufficiently large quantum computer exists, this is possible, but i expect that unless the input utxo is very large, this is a very poor use of its compute time. the QC's compute time is likely very valuable and there will be a high maintenance cost to keep the qubits coherent.

many exchange-traded products exhibit a similar behavior: many small movements and episodically larger movements that are unidirectional. this behavior has been studied extensively by people who do trade automation and is essentially a result of human "flocking" behavior, similar to a group of birds. most of the time, trades are somewhat random, then every so often the psychology of the market participants galvanizes and moves in one direction.
another factor to consider here is that, afaict, the exchange rates for BTC to fiat currencies is strongly influenced by traders who conduct trades that would be illegal in regulated markets, e.g. painting the tape. this means that in addition to the usual human psychological factors of price movements, there are groups who are systematically manipulating the market. these market manipulators have a vested interest in large unidirectional movements since it allows them to cash-out and buy-in strategically without having to do volatility plays.

i'm really confused by this - i would have expected any cryptocurrency that uses scrypt to have left p and N as knobs they could use to adjust the difficulty (p and N being the parameters that control memory footprint of scrypt). guess i should have a closer look at how scrypt is incorporated into ltc, etc.
if you can adjust p*N accordingly, scrypt can be tuned to use massive amounts of memory, far more than i would expect could be wired into an asic. i imagine the best case scenario to involve some kind of tricks with the memory architecture.

hi there, i'm the CEO of conformal systems.
the goal was never to compete with paypal, so it is rather amusing to be framed as a competitor. frankly, i'm flattered. the big idea was to allow companies and independent contractors to continue "business as usual" by invoicing their customers in USD and getting paid in BTC.
since we are a payment processor, the onus of BSA/AML does not weigh as heavily on our business as, say, an exchange. despite this, we still apply a great deal of scrutiny to each account that is created on our site. if it is not clear what kinds of products or services you are invoicing for, we will not approve your account or your invoices. i cannot say too much about our internal processes since they need to remain opaque to repel scammers et al.
with respect to the fee of 3.99%, we have opted to start with a higher fee based on (1) the risk we take settling from revocable instruments (USD-denominated checks and wires) to irrevocable instruments (BTC) and (2) that if you price your service too low, it is not practical to increase the price later. companies that settle transactions from BTC -&gt; BTC or BTC -&gt; USD, e.g. bitpay, take on very limited systemic risk because incoming BTC transactions are irrevocable, i.e. they cannot be reversed. in our case, there is the possibility that people will submit fraudulent/invalid payment instruments that we are "on the hook for" with the bank, assuming we have already sent the outgoing payment in BTC, which is irrevocable. if we started with too low a rate, we cannot raise it later without, understandably, upsetting our existing customers. we may very well drop the rate from 3.99% at a later point once we have gauged the extent of our risk from settling transactions from USD -&gt; BTC.
note that a feature of our service is that you can operate a business without having a bank account.
we will be expanding our offerings in the near future, so keep your eyes peeled.

one of the biggest problems with the idea of "taint" is how to define it. for example, i have experienced situations where banks and payment processors consider some act to have a negative moral or social content, e.g. pornography or online gambling.
in some cases, the act that institutions consider negative carries the perception of "taint" and they will pass judgment on you outside the local body of law, e.g. close your account or blacklist you. even if the idea of taint is restricted to funds procured in a strictly illegal fashion, the definition of taint will simply creep in scope to suit those applying the filtering.
the idea of taint is a slippery slope and should be treated with caution.

note that these sorts of scenarios are exactly why payment processors are exempted from BSA/AML requirements.
here is an example in the context of a conventional payment processor: company X sets up credit card processing through merchant service provider A, then company X sends most of its proceeds from sales to shady company Z (after funds are deposited to X's bank account). this is barely different from payment processor A depositing directly to the accounts of company Z, which is not company X, with whom A has a payment processing agreement. the upshot here is that conventional payment processors, just like bitcoin payment processors, can be gamed and utilized to launder or redirect funds.
the argument that "but with bitcoin, it's different" is painfully irrelevant in light of such examples. one can always take questionable actions with received funds and it is outside the responsibility of the payment processor to deal with such situations unless they are aware/complicit of/in them.
sorry, i don't buy your explanation of your sockpuppet account. it is as weak as your accusation that we engage in reverse-factoring, which is a real stretch.

normally i'm not one to ask, but you did make the post: what line of business are you in? there are only so many things that bitpay will not allow.

You have won the prize.
@_date: 2013-09-20 06:18:17


I'm glad to see you "get it".


Since we are a payment processor, the KYC/AML rules are substantially less stringent than for virtual currency exchanges.  For US-based merchants, we need to submit IRS Form 1099-K if there is decent processing volume and for non-US merchants we need to receive a completed IRS Form W-8.  Being a payment processor is the most well-defined exception to the money transmitter regulations in the US.


Currently, there is no maximum amount that can be put on an invoice.  We must feel comfortable with your line of business and approve each invoice individually.  If you have a large invoice, we can likely accommodate it.


It is worth noting that settling payments from BTC to either BTC or USD has almost zero systemic risk, only short-term exchange rate risk when guaranteeing spot rates.  In the case of settling USD to BTC, there is a small risk of issues settling on the USD side and we charge an accordingly higher rate.  Our rates may change in the future, but we decided to start at 3.99% rather than go too low.


We are based out of Chicago and have developers working around the US.


It is hard to predict what will happen with US regulatory bodies, but we will make sure to comply with regulations as they arise.
EDIT: changed wording about W-8 forms

the decoupling of the wallet and the chain makes for all kinds of useful architecture options for end users and businesses building products around bitcoin.

Due to the fact that we issue invoices with up to Net 180 payment terms, we cannot guarantee exchange rates for BTC/USD until we have received payment for an invoice and it is part of our available balance in a bank account.
Once funds are available in our bank account, we purchase the BTC as close to 0900 CDT as possible on the following day.  This means that if you wire funds and they become available in our bank account after 0900, the BTC are purchased the next morning.  In practice, funds from wire transfers are often not available for use the same day they arrive.

speaking from the perspective of someone who actually made a real concerted effort to setup an exchange in the US and gave up, the real barrier to entry is a bank account. we tried to get an MSB bank account at roughly 50-75 banks in Chicago, and _nobody_ would give us an account.
if you can get a bank account, you can actually start doing business and get money transmitter licenses state-by-state. the licenses are just a bunch of paperwork that serves to verify the owners and officers are not criminals. the money transmitter licensing is a giant cash hole.
finding a bank on native land that is willing to give an account to an exchange shouldn't be that hard: casinos are similar in that they are very heavily regulated and they manage to operate here. similarly, several payday loan companies, which are also MSBs, have setup in these tribal sovereign areas.

bitcoins are most definitely not anonymous, they are only "pseudonymous".
if you make a point to mix your coins between each transaction made, you can have be very close to anonymous. even with mixing, a determined adversary could try to back-correlate mixed coins to their origin.
to have your coins be anonymous (or as close to anonymous as possible) requires taking several non-trivial steps.

i hate recurring billing from some places. i have junk on my bank accounts that should have stopped billing years ago in some cases.

let's make sure to keep the scale of this charge in mind
"Last month, Japan's financial watchdog ordered Mizuho to improve its business after discovering through an inspection that the bank had engaged in 230 transactions with people with ties to organized crime involving more than ¥200 million ($2 million), mostly in the form of auto loans."
Mizuho Financial Group holds roughly USD 2T in assets. the laundering of USD 2M is almost nothing in terms of their total transactions, so i think they're doing quite well in comparison to hsbc's laundering
"HSBC was accused of failing to monitor more than $670 billion in wire transfers and more than $9.4 billion in purchases of U.S. currency from HSBC Mexico, allowing for money laundering, prosecutors said."
i doubt this has much to do with mtgox.

completely agree with you.
the blockchain being an entirely public ledger leads to some unusual consequences for your privacy. combine that with monitoring of newly-relayed transactions and you can often get a decent idea of not only how much was sent, but from where.
some people may argue that "mixing is shady. if you're on the up-and-up, you should have nothing to hide." the trouble here is that there are, for the most part, only 2 states in terms of privacy with bitcoin (and other public-ledger cryptocurrencies): (A) everything is unmixed and can be analyzed, or (B) it is mixed and very difficult to analyze. i'll take mixed output any day because i value my privacy - i would not feel comfortable with people knowing or being able to infer my bank account transactions.

i think the US is definitely losing out on a lot of cryptocurrency action that it should otherwise have due to the money transmission laws. the US also has the most to lose from cryptocurrency if it ever challenged the world reserve status of the USD.
however, understand these rules are enacted in an almost entirely reactive manner. the money transmission regulations are built to avoid having consumers getting screwed, like when a wallet service gets hacked and all the funds are "stolen". it does make you wonder if wallet services are money transmitters since they offer effectively centralized stored value certificates than can be stolen.
i don't like the rules at all myself, but they are unlikely to change without a very serious amount of agitating.

are wallet services considered money transmitters? they offer company-issued stored value instruments, so i would expect so.
it is exactly this scenario that money transmission laws in the US aim to stop: money gets "stolen" in transit and customers are left holding the bag. i have no reason to doubt that BIPS really got robbed, but it's also very difficult to discern an inside job from a legitimate outside attack, even when you have all the facts.
NOTE: i am not a fan of the US money transmission laws, but i understand why they were created. the motivation for these regulations is to prevent criminals or other bad actors from defrauding their customers.

afaict, the charges are based entirely on irc logs, which is super shaky evidence. what's to say the FBI didn't seize the servers and simply edit the text file containing the logs to suit their narrative?
it is sad how people assume that everything listed in the LE charges is true. i have a feeling most of these charges will not stick.

the crypto slowness is a result of using arbitrary precision arithmetic in go's standard lib crypto functions. we expect that with some straightforward adjustments, e.g. swapping out arbitrary precision for fixed precision and being a bit smarter about projective coordinate transformations, the speed will improve substantially.
we doubt that it will be necessary to use assembler like libsecp256k1 does, but we could always go that route. trouble with the asm is that it is not very maintainable (write-only code for all intents and purposes).
the crypto speed only comes into play when doing all the signature checking on the last section of the chain after the last checkpoint at ~250K blocks. having a relatively powerful cpu allows you to power through this without much drama.

as someone with a lot of experience dealing with payment systems as a merchant, you will almost surely find that building any link between paypal or credit cards and bitcoin violates at least one, if not several parts of the terms of service.
paypal and credit cards are very chargeback-friendly and merchant-unfriendly. that could end _very_ badly for you as the merchant. i have been charged back thousands of USD in a single shot by fraudsters and scammers several times and both paypal and credit card companies are highly incentivized to allow and facilitate this behavior.

per userbased's comment, what you stated about the 10 minute average is actually incorrect. i had made the same assumption in the past and here is the explanation of how it actually works:
the bitcoin protocol adjusts difficulty to target an average time between blocks of 10 minutes. there is a bound of how much the difficulty can increase or decrease in a given period, where the period is 2016 blocks in length. at the end of each 2016 block period, the difficulty can adjust up or down by up to a factor of 4, i.e. difficulty for next period is bounded by 25% on the low end and 400% on the high end vs difficulty in prior period. bringing lots of new mining power online in a short period of time has outstripped this bound on difficulty adjustment in the past and will continue to do so in the future.

default is a way of life for most US citizens, much less the state :)
since other countries have bought into the US scam, it is exceedingly unlikely that they will let a few late payments on debt shake their confidence too much. the speculators can do what they want, but the state-level players will not sit idly by while the USD implodes.
if the USD weakens too much, exports to the US will drop and have serious secondary effects.

while this may not be precisely a blacklist, it's still an _awful_ idea. you know that LE organizations are working on this same thing and you are basically "working for the man" if you're working on this project.
i consider the lack of built-in mixing to be a fundamental weakness of bitcoin. hopefully some altcoin will fix this in the future.
so what we're being told is that "in order to make ppl less nervous about BTC, we're going to setup a system that makes it _less_ anonymous than the USD". wow, what a lame idea.

this is pretty much correct: go devs rewrote the crypto and made their own library. the motivation is to prevent calling out to external libraries via cgo and allow go to cross-compile smoothly. if you call out to e.g. openssl via cgo, it works on a given platform, but you then need to roll binaries on each platform separately since openssl will need to be compiled on each platform.

something to consider is that when you get VC funding, you often don't control the company any longer since receiving funding involves giving up majority control of the voting stock. it may be peter's investors and not him that is leading the charge on the lawsuit, but i don't have any further insight into the situation.
having a foundation that represents a project becomes messy when the foundation members act "at odds" with the foundation. i actually have some experience with this scenario and it sucks.

the real problem is that banks and payment networks, especially in the US, have been systematically pushing out high-risk merchants from various merchant service providers.
it seems to be some kind of soft regulation on part of the banks wherein they dictate "morally, we don't like this business, but we are aware it is entirely legal". they frame the issue as "we don't want the reputational risk of having you as a customer", which is bullshit since no other customer is going to say "omg! you work with _those_ dudes?!?" and close their account.
after you have been put in this bucket, you have to use shady high-risk merchant service providers which can steal your funds, etc, etc. bitcoin is a great way to get around these dodgy MSPs and avoid chargebacks. the bullshit part about most chargebacks is that merchants will often opt to willingly refund customer charges when contacted and threatened with a chargeback. the people who initiate chargebacks are often scammers since doing a chargeback is a chunk of work on part of the cardholder and any normal person just wants their money back.

i can't tell if this guy is being an agent provocateur and trying to incur the wrath of BoA and have it directed at bitcoin, or if he's really just yelling at BoA for yellin's sake. bravo for confusing me, sir!
amusement from the first tweet aside, in either case this is not good for bitcoin. antagonizing banks is very much counterproductive for improving the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-05-05 17:42:41
many businesses that take bitcoin also accept other payment types, meaning that it is not likely necessary for them to convert BTC -&gt; local currency to pay their taxes: they simply pay with the local currency they already have from other payment types.
this is obviously a problem for businesses that have BTC as their sole payment type.

everything you say is spot on: i am currently having a dev team [write a bitcoind alternative in Go]( i am rather familiar with all the moving pieces, albeit not on the level of the devs doing the actual hacking.
having seen a lot of software projects spin up, i can tell you that bitcoin definitely represents the concerted effort of a group. the initial windows code may have been written by a single person, but the amount of foresight, planning and execution involved is definitely beyond the abilities of a single person. i estimate, at a minimum, a 3 person group is behind this, if not a much larger group.

it would make me sad if this was "fake news" designed to manipulate the market. if this was the case, bitcoin has been reduced to a reality tv show.
