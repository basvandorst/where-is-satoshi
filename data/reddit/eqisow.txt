When was it ever a democracy? Women couldn't vote until 1920 and the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 to stop race based voter suppression. The Presidential election was stolen by the courts in 2000, so I guess you could argue we had some vaguely democratic years between 1965 and 2000.

Right, so different groups studied the issue and came to different conclusions. Like I said, we can never really know, which is why it was vital that the recount be completed.
Instead, the Supreme Court went ahead and called the election along partisan lines.

The truth is, unfortunately, we'll never know for sure what the result would have been.
So yes, stolen.

[Defamation is a legal term]( A thinly veiled threat is still a threat.

Android certainly isn't perfect, but the only "better" alternative is to go entirely without a mobile phone. I'm not Richard Stallman, so I compromise, but I still want to have as much control over my system as is feasible.
I was already looking past the issue of Coinomi being closed source. I wouldn't keep large amounts in a Coinomi wallet but for, say, amounts I would typically carry in cash, it's a risk I was willing to take.
I really do think the response you quoted came off as extremely douchey and vaguely threatening, though. I touched on the threatening part, but he also conflated ["free as in freedom"
 with "free as in beer"]( and I have a hard time believing he doesn't know the difference. Whoever he was responding to saying Coinomi is no longer free as in freedom is entirely correct.
So to your last point, I do think some things are free. Wikipedia is a great example. It's free to use, donating is optional, it has no ads, and they literally are a non-profit. Free Software is actually free, though unfortunately it's often repackaged in non-free ways like the case of Android.

You really don't. Perhaps should consider there's a subtlety here that's being lost on you.


This is weird becuase you actually acknowledge later in your post that Android source is available. Even so, I use a community version and not the one from Google or my manufacturer. 


It's not ideal, but you [can absolutely release open source software with nonfree libraries](


[Wikipedia runs on open source code]( too.

So he responded with a threat?
That settles it; I'm moving away from Coinomi. The Electrum mobile wallet already supports SegWit anyway.

How can you tell a pizza isn't worth 35 million USD?
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:11:24
No, you compare the price of the pizza in USD to what else you might get for that amount and you decide there are things you'd rather have for 35 million USD than a pizza.
Likewise, you compare the price of the pizza in BTC to what else you might get for that amount and you decide there are things you'd rather have for 5,000 BTC than a pizza.

That's nonsense. USD valuation also varies based on the individual.
Nothing after that is even relevant to what I said.

My local pawn shop pays like $200, and people sell it, so there you go.

The distinction you're trying to make is arbitrary. All your argument comes down to, as far as I can tell, is that BTC value isn't stable. You're right that the value is unstable, of course, but businesses still price things in BTC and they do actually change the BTC prices constantly.
BTC prices aren't default prices and they aren't stable prices, but it strikes me as odd to argue things aren't priced in BTC when merchants are actively taking it as payment. If your hypothetical European shop also took USD as payment, I think it would be fair to say that the ~8 EUR item is ALSO priced at $10, even if not listed as such.
The USD price would also likely be based on current exchange rate, much like BTC prices.
