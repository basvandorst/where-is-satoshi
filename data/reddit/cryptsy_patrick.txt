A bug in the frontend caused a failure of some of our webservers. We repaired the problem and brought them back up in a way where they are less prone to these issues in the future.

We do not accept coins on who puts the most into the voting. And the free votes carry more weight than the paid votes.  I was personally offered 2.5 btc to list a coin, I turned it down and told the user that he needed to go through the same scrutiny that we give to any other coin. At the end of the day, we do not favor those coins with thew most btc donated to pay for votes.

The things that you accuse us of doing would be pretty difficult to pull off and keep certain perks such as:

That debacle was not very fun for us.

Early in the morning yesterday we performed server maintenance and took the site offline for about twenty minutes. We brought it back online and ran a system audit for about two hours. Later last night a bug in the frontend caused a failure of some of our webservers. We repaired the problem and brought them back up in a way where they are less prone to these issues in the future.

It may *seem* sketchy the way we do voting, however the intention is to make the way we work more transparent to our community. We do not just add any coin that gets to the top of the list, we do our homework and look to see how much volume a coin has, if a coin is pre-mined or not. All in all the voting system is to see if there are enough people interested in said coin to keep the volume flowing.

I am sorry that this happened, occasionally our support staff are brief on tickets especially on a current issue where every ticket is the same. Has the issue continued?

I'm sorry that you feel this way, we have been working on our relationship with the public. As such we are striving to be more open and transparent about how and when we run things. Our site was down for a total of 20 minutes, did you file a support ticket? Our support team is very prompt.

We are having issues with a select piece of hardware at our data center. This piece of equipment helps balance, and sync the important data that one finds on the various web front ends, and various other tasks. We expect to have resolution soon. I will update as I know more.
For updates and more info you can find us on Freenode at

I met you guys at the Miami Conference last year. I was very excited about League and Battlefield being viable options. Glad to see you guys coming along nicely.
