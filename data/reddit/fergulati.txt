***Interview begins around 26'00" but maybe give us a listen too because we bring the awesome :)***
Week in and week out we wait for that magical day where ~~Jesus comes back to earth to carry us away~~ bitcoin is massively adopted. If you use Bitcoin, you definitely know that Bitcoin needs to become more practical. It’s great for cross border transactions but it doesn’t seem ready for the mainstream. Merchants are often stuck in their ways, hard to persuade, and building additional infrastructure takes time and costs money. What if I told you there was a way to buy things with bitcoin without having to wait for merchants to accept Bitcoin? That’s right, Tap &amp; Pay using Bitcoin at any NFC-enabled point-of-sale terminal on the planet, with Plutus, suckas! It is powered by a Decentralized Exchange Network (DEX), which traders can use to buy and sell Bitcoin in return for fiat at the checkout. Merchants do not need to directly accept any digital currencies and customers can convert their balance into fiat on-the-go. Feel like you’re in a dream? Well let us pinch you! This is why it’s time for a new era of payments. Plutus merges both blockchain technology and existing international NFC infrastructure to bring contactless Bitcoin payments into the mainstream. CEO of Plutus Filip Martinka stops by to let you know how the revolution will be televised.
Still not a believer? They have just started a 1 week long bitcoin experiment, where they will spend an entire week paying only using bitcoin through the Plutus contactless payment app.

Every 10th episode of our podcast is concocted to replicate the smell of the fermented grain mash spirit we all know and love. What exactly does that mean? Well, if you follow the show, it means we get together with some friends, drink drinks, light some stoogies, and chat about bitcoin and blockchain topics. Enjoy all the benefits of pouring a nice adult beverage into a functionally designed vessel of your choice, whilst chatting about finance, all without the repercussions, like the frequent 24-hour hangovers, the unsafe hook-ups, the weight gain, etc. Our homie Andrew joins us on the show who has NO CLUE what bitcoin is. We educate him and Marcello has to defend himself on why knowing the identity of the probable creator of bitcoin is important. Remember, sweetness is perceived more on the tongue than in the nose, so press play and drink us in, folks.

Its not often that you meet someone who has such a common sense yet sophisticated focused approach on what makes the blockchain network marketing profession….professional. We invite Augur director of marketing Tony Sakich, a former marketing manager at payment processor BitPay. Augur is an open source decentralized prediction market platform built on blockchain technology similar to Bitcoin called Ethereum. Tony introduces blockchain technology and the Ethereum platform, his background and past successes in the decentralized technology space, the most essential communities used to promote Augur and the future of the industry.

Awesome observation, and we address that.  I believe you are absolutely correct.  But, it doesn't reflect a much more balanced (even if slightly) population of the financial industry.  I personally do not see it as a problem...but an opportunity.  And, given that more times than not, women tend to run family finances, I think it would be an awesome push toward mass adoption if women  made up a larger percentage of our community.

1000% agree.
There are a monumental amount of people that know nothing about the intricacies of a combustion engine; yet, they own and operate cars.
What they do know about cars:
(1) Gas pedal is go
(2) Brake pedal is stop
(3) Fuel keeps the car moving 
What they need to know about Bitcoin:
(1) Wallet keeps my money
(2) 'My' key sends my money
(3) 'Them' Key receives my money
If we as a community can't dumb it down to those three bullet points, then this Bitcoin experiment will take flight like an Orca Whale.  We know more bullet points about Bitcoin, just like a mechanic knows more bullet points about my V6. He takes that knowledge and derives a service.  We want mass adoption...we need to take our knowledge and derive services.

Is it so hard to say, "The Bitcoin Blockchain."
Wall Street is treating Bitcoin like they're sleeping with her but doesn't want anyone to know.
"Hey, saw you hanging out with Bitcoin at the bar last night...she's hot man, do work!"
"Oh...yeah but we're just friends, I mean she's cool and all but like I don't see her like that."
"Why not?! She has a lot to offer, you may hit it off."
"I'm just tryna hit it and quit it real quick...no what I'm sayin'?!"

Your views on Bitcoin are directly related to the country you live in. 
And, Bitcoin will do all of those things you listed in due time.  But, it will do them better.
In my opinion, using Bitcoin in the Western World is majorly a political statement.  I'm from the US, and given the abundance of shroud covering the cogs of our economy and the alarmingly high level of corruption in our congress...I'd like to separate my money from the state.
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:13:55
Firstly, it's in another subreddit somewhere.
Secondly, I wouldn't consider our topic for the show an outcry.  That's a bit much.  We are just highlighting and trying our best to present our observation.
Thirdly, maybe dudes should start assessing why there aren't more of them in those industries.  If gender-biases are being zapped and eroded then I suppose that bias will go as well.  Here's to dudes with soft hands!

Realistic, but not ideal to do. They all make less money by attempting to gain 51% because it will devalue the system and ultimately bring profits to zero.  The end-game for a miner is to preserve the longevity of the system in order to have a profitable and competitive fee-conomy after all the coin is mined.
Or they can by selfish dicks and bring it all down like the Joker.
@_date: 2015-06-14 06:30:02
NewEgg's loss.  I was just about to give them $120 in BTC for a 5TB hard drive. I guess they don't want my money.
I can understand if it's cumbersome in a brick and mortar store to accept Bitcoin. But, online with no maintenance and plenty of services that make accepting BTC easy, and to have it go straight to USD?
They dumb.

***Interview begins around 21'30"***
Every day we buy products that impact our planet. Every product and business is different, but rarely do we have the information we need to make positive choices about what to buy. Enter, Jessi Baker, the founder of Provenance, which is building on the blockchain that presents a paradigm shift for business and society: from one where you need to generate trust in your brand and product, to one where trust can be implicit. Because, for the first time, an accessible, yet secure, shared truth exists. Is there anything bitcoin can’t do? Holy cow. This week we get her on the show to chat about the importance of supply chain transparency (and how a data solution could help solve it) and the implications of blockchain technology. We can use the blockchain to bring transparency to your supply chain and trace a footprint for your products! This is a leap forward that enables businesses to harness technology to prove the attributes that make their materials, ingredients and finished products great.

Oh no, I could...but Bitcoin is the high risk asset of high risk assets.  If you've ever been to Vegas and put a few hundos on black...then you'll try anything short of The Force to make yourself believe that ball is going to land on black. Right now, having bitcoin as an investment is like putting money down on a number at the roulette table (or maybe the evens at this point in the game), I just spew out hope-for-the-best rhetoric because it makes me feel better about my risk.

I did feel deep, not so edgy though because both of those references are used pretty frequently.  I do understand the reference, just poking at your name that is a billboard for your bias.  Hell, maybe a blimp with a waving banner too.
Hell, I'll even own to being a bit foolish too. But, can I ask why not just use a number bigger than a petabyte instead of saying "multi-petabyte"?  I mean I get it, multiple petabytes, but why not just up the supremum a bit more?
In all honesty,  I don't think the big bankers are scared of anything...not a f****** thing! And, that is why I think BTC is not such a bad idea after all just like everyone else in this subreddit. Living without fear is living in a fantasy land, you accept it and be courageous or you succumb and subscribe to the traits of a coward.  If you ask me, creating a system where it is impossible for you to fail is cowardice.
@_date: 2014-03-20 03:14:39
LoL...orrrrrrrr not?  I would mine BTC too if I had tens of millions in USD and a few warehouses laying around. Mining is just fun.

The video is 1'01" long, an awesome transaction length at McDonald's is 30-45 seconds (everyone had a job at 16 which is how I know this). So, in comparison I think a 1'01" long transaction is pretty good from the comfort of your own desktop computer.  I think any part of the populous that does not consider this process simple, is simply a simpleton.

@_date: 2014-07-22 18:48:16
No, it's there...but you can be comfortable with seeing the transaction hit the network (almost instantaneous), go make a nice sandwhich (assuming you're home), then come back and awe in the math at work.
I've made a handful of purchases now all through Coinbase, and I'm comfortable making two clicks and walking away. 10-20 secs later the email confirmations start rolling in. And, an hour later the blockchain brings me resolution.

When the blockchain and bitcoin are invisible to the end user, then that must mean that you’re adding some other value to the consumer. [Align Commerce]( was founded by a world class team with over 100 years of combined experience in banking IT infrastructure management.  They enable businesses and payment platforms to send and receive payments in local currency, by using the blockchain as a new payment rail. On the surface, it doesn’t seem like a very exciting premise for a “financial revolution,” but let’s think about what’s actually happening here. Small businesses that have no formal partnerships, binding contracts, or even lines of credit between them, are settling cross-border payments in real-time on behalf of their customers. This has never been possible before without a centralized intermediary. We get the Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Aldo Carrascoso in the studio to chat about all this juicy Bitcoin remittances stuff. Also, Tony Swish of [Augur]( fills in for Corey.

We always assume Bitcoin and Blockchain will take off in the U.S. and Canada but we always like to pull guests and get their perspective of Third World and former Communist states. The gang call a Burger King in the Netherlands who reward Bitcoin customers with a free Whopper and then we call a Burger King in the United States who have no idea what Bitcoin is. Quite the fun social experiment.This week, we explore the how blockchain technology will effect real estate transactions, records, and investing and bring together experts from the traditional real estate sector as well as Bitcoin and Blockchain enthusiasts to create connections that will benefit both industries. In order to do so, we welcome the two hardest working men in the Crypto space, Director of Business Development, Matt McKibbin and our past guest Christian Saucier. To give you an overview; they are about to launch their real estate MVP, and in talks with several prominent VC’s who have expressed interest. Christian was at a couple conferences this month representing [Ubitquity]( (formerly iNation), and Matt will be at one at the World Bank’s Land and Poverty Conference 2016: Scaling up Responsible Land Governance March 14-16, 2016 in Washington D.C.

The boys compare bitcoin to the Animatrix and we invite [Emin]( a professor at Cornell University to talk a bit about how he has worked to improve Bitcoin in various ways during these, oh so troubling times. In the past, he’s worked on peer-to-peer systems of various kinds. He was behind Karma, the first peer-to-peer currency with a distributed mint, and he also built Credence, a peer-to-peer reputation scheme that counteracted spam and mislabeled files. Emin has also built many other academic peer-to-peer systems, and has worked to defend some of the most popular ones in court. As we near episod 50, we hope you continue to find these discussions of distributed systems, operating systems and systems engineering to be thought provoking. Let’s get into it!

He came here to The Bitcoin Podcast to talk about bitcoin, the music industry and spread love. In fact, he specializes in love. A lot of people wonder, the small majority who don’t understand, wonder why Lil B would be here. But you know, it’s good. He loves to spread love, you know. That’s what he is here to do. He blessed our podcast with good vibes and after texting back and forth with him on a Friday night, told us to call him ‘real fast’. After appearing on MSNBC, and conducting lectures at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Carnegie Mellon University, we wanted to hear from The BasedGod himself about life’s most wonderful internet magic money. Quiet children….The BasedGod is speaking.

***Interview begins around 15'***
This week we try and shift the emphasis slightly away from programming and towards putting the spotlight on companies being built. Circumnavigating the planet teaching blockchain, Ryan X Charles finds himself in our studio to discuss how he is starting his own blockchain-based social media company called [Datt]( a decentralized content sharing app with integrated bitcoin payments. Oh, and he just created his own fork of bitcoin called Ryan X. Charles Bitcoin, and it’s exactly the same as bitcoin, except MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is eight million instead of one million. No big deal. He left BitPay to join reddit as the “world’s first official cryptocurrency engineer” where he lead the development of reddit’s cryptoequity project, reddit notes. When reddit changed leadership, he joined BitGo to work on bitcoin multisig security. He’s been programming for over 20 years, and has experience with many technologies and languages, including Python, C, C++, and javascript. But like I said, we’re shifting AWAY from that stuff. Oh, what can I say, we love the nerdy stuff. Don’t worry, there are lots of dick and fart jokes sprinkled in so you can stay engaged. Holla at your Datt, son!

Take your rate and divide it by the current USD-BTC exchange rate...and that number will be the number of bitcoin you charge.  For instance, ($375/$425.38) as of 10:27CDT on Bitstamp, would mean that you charge ~.88156BTC

Jon Fitch says he is “too good anywhere” for most welterweights in MMA. We tend to agree. This weekend he will collide with Joao “The Brazilian Samurai” Zeferino for the vacant World Series of Fighting welterweight (170 pounds) championship at stake. As we anticipate the weigh-ins tomorrow and the actual fight, we talk a bit about being the first MMA fighter to be fully paid in bitcoin. Fitch loves cryptocurrency and he thinks it is bringing about a new form of commerce. In addition we talk about Zuffa, the legalization of MMA in New York, Joe Rogan, bringing the Muhammad Ali Act into MMA, and more! Tony Swish and Cello are your guys on the 1’s &amp; 2’s while the normal gang sit in for this special mid-week roundtable. Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit’s Tiiiiiiiiiiiiiime!!!

No matter what our background is, the longer we do this podcast, the more community experience we can add to our resumes. We take a break from prodding technological advances and invite an Airbitz community manager on. After all, all three of us are Airbitz ambassadors, we might as well do our part. M.K. Lords joins us on the show this week and although she sounds like the level 9 boss on Dark Souls II, she was actually a writer and panelist with Bitcoin Not Bombs, Bitcoin Magazine, and other Bitcoin media groups. M.K. is a prominent voice for privacy and accountability in the Bitcoin space and she brings her diverse experience in public speaking, writing, event organization and content creation to the podcast to school us on spreading the values of the Airbitz team. After all….Airbitz helps to spend bitcoins “in the real world”. If you start seeing the same black cat walk past your door twice, YOUR WINDOWS JUST TURNED INTO BRICK WALLS, RUN!!

***Interview begins around 22'00"***
Canadians are overly optimistic when it comes to bitcoin. One look at the Canadian bitcoin scenario and anyone can predict that it has the potential to become the world’s bitcoin hub. Starting with the Canadian senate’s decision to go easy on the cryptocurrency to the number of bitcoin companies, we see it happening right before our eyes. This week on the show we discuss this and put the spotlight on [Equibit]( which bills itself as a global P2P OTC (over-the-counter) platform; a block-chain-based securities register that manages OTC equity, warrants and more. The CEO himself, Chris Horlacher, who is an expert in business strategy, transformation and process improvement, joins us in the studio all way the from Toronto and is all set to revolutionize the way securities are dealt with. By democratizing the OTC securities industry, Equibit gives back more control to issuers, brokers and investors. They represents a totally new model that automates tasks investors are currently paying billions each year to have performed. Saving BILLIONS! Holy shit. Press play!

***Interview is up front after ads***
Imogen Heap joins us in the studio this week as we move past our starstruck haze, to get to the bottom of why, in our age of the internet, many artists are struggling to get a fair deal. She is hoping to change all that, using a technology that could revolutionize the way music is produced and shared. Heap is one of a group of artists and coders who are using blockchain technology to launch and distribute music. Blockchain technology aims to record all recent transactions on a network and file them back as a permanent database. She’s also the only female artist to have won a Grammy for engineering. So, I think she knows what she’s talking about. In addition, past guest Tony Sakich loved being on the show so much he joins us this week on the roundtable. IMOGEN HEAP IS ON THE SHOW! A monstrous psychedelic bubble just exploded in our minds.

Let’s face it: embracing change is no fun. Everyone likes staying in his or her comfort zone. After all, they call it a “comfort” zone for a reason—even the term itself stirs up deep feelings of calm, relaxation and security. But eventually, something comes along to shake us out of it. We welcome the [Lawnmower.io]( vealing their latest update &amp;amp; expansion plans. Most importantly, they removed “spare change” and replaced much of the branding and screens centered around this concept, and in place have some brand new functionality, screens, and hopefully a much smoother user experience. What could be bad about a fresh new “Analytics” page with a bunch of cool data on your account &amp;amp; trading performance? We dive into this and more!

I can dig where you are coming from; however, if you are a layperson and you hear, "be your own bank--brainwallet--paper wallet..." arent you going to check out?
Those things are cool to me, cool to you.  The geopolitical thing is cool to me, and cool to you...but Sheena, wants to know if she swipes her card to fill up her gas tank with her babies in the back...she is gonna get her gas.
On another note, I most absolutely will say all of those things when explaining in depth to a different person.  I just try to assess the knowledge need based upon the flow of conversation. Think of it like this, some people need to know where the constants '4' and '2' come from in the quadratic formula...other people just need to know where to plug in the numbers.

Man! I really appreciate this feedback.  I hope you tune into the rest that I do, because there will be a lot.  I am going to make sure I try to hammer down at least one or two of these huge paradigms per person.

Mass amenability disregards names of previous entities. If millions of people start referring to it as smart money, then WSJ's publication gets trumped.
Plus I feel more comfortable (and slightly cooler not gonna lie) asking a merchant if they accept smart money. I feel like it opens up the conversational chessboard a bit more.

So I take from this that decentralization is paramount for the aspirations of Bitcoin. In my opinion, if there is a reasonable amount of decentralization then the consensus amongst those on the network is a great representation of the population that uses Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-27 02:44:11
Let em get it wrong...Austin, TX, is turning into quite the Bitcoin friendly place. It has a thriving tech community that's rivaling it's live music community.  A lot of buzz about it being "Silicone of the South." If Cali gets it wrong, then third time is the charm in Texas.
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:56:05
I'm not thinking that there would be more gold, I'm thinking what if those grams had more value?
Hypothetically Bitcoin achieves its potential...a global currency.  If everyone is using it do we just move the decimal around, or does Bitcoin imply that being behind the decimal is okay.
For instance, if my net worth is behind the decimal in USD, then I'm waaaaay below poverty. But, in a future with a moon-valued Bitcoin, being behind the decimal would still be okay? Let's say .03 BTC equates to $30k, it's a philosophical and psychological leap to not be displeased with the number .03.
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:21:54
So the sales pitch, "cheaper to accept than credit cards," is only a conditional sales pitch?  Assuming we reach that 3000x userbase, what it then swap to where centralized payment processors were less expensive?
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:35:40
I don't understand what is so difficult...if more people are to transact then we need to start making that a possiblity.  How is that not an overall positive?
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:27:23
Point taken...I should've spoken for my own experiences with on boarding bitcoiners.

I ain't mad at you /vagina_fang. I actually consider myself a little more level-headed than your frontpage bitcoiner.  I think Bitcoin has a 50/50 shot at success.  In the chance it does succeed the ROI will be monumental, hell maybe historical. I myself am a Buffetian investor but I like to flirt with tech a little more which is why Bitcoin is in my portfolio.
That being said, everyone here is right. Bitcoin is an investment, a risky one, but a tantalizing one in the same build.  Just because it is risky doesn't mean it isn't worthy of discussion in r/investing.  I think what is being shown is that the mods over there are fearful of every other post being about Bitcoin as more and more of your obviously intelligent subscribers learn more and more about Bitcoin and stop discrediting it as an investment.
That's my ~.0001 BTC!

I was thinking Andreas too...dude is legit.
Only reason I ask is because at the end of the day...people, everyday people, want to tie a face and name, or faces and names, to things so pivotal.  The internet got away with not having a name and face because it's monumental utility, and, frankly, it's not money.

He left BitPay to join reddit as the “world’s first official cryptocurrency engineer” where he lead the development of reddit’s cryptoequity project, reddit notes. When reddit changed leadership, he joined BitGo to work on bitcoin multisig security.

In the 1960s, when the practice of software development was first emerging, the industry chose to take the ‘code-domain’ route. We have wound back the clock, and we are choosing differently. A small development team from Australia are poised to bring a potential trillion dollar industry to bitcoin. This development team is lead by Noel Lovisa, who joins us in the studio to tell us about an entirely new software development technology that utilizes a peer-to-peer network of vendors who transact exclusively using bitcoin. So what is all this called? Simply, Code Valley. When Bitcoin appeared on his radar in 2011, he immediately recognized that a software supply-chain, fueled by a Bitcoin blockchain, would make a dangerous combination. In addition, podcast regular Tony Sakich joins us on the roundtable.

It’s only natural that we keep our eye on the rising tide of alternative content delivery platforms, particularly ones that incentivize decentralization using cryptocurrency. It will likely take years of technical development before this suite of technologies is commercially viable. Yet, this mountain of computer engineering is not our greatest challenge. The real challenge is to build something that’s actually worth building. Enter [PopChest]( a Santa Monica-based Bitcoin video startup, where users can unlock their favorite content simply by paying in bitcoin. To know more about PopChest and the platform decentralization process, we invite the platform creator, Valerian Bennett, onto the show to discuss his enthusiasm for the world-changing possibilities of Bitcoin. Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop!

***INTERVIEW STARTS AROUND 16'00"***
Gide and the Chamber of Digital Commerce announced a strategic partnership in which Gide will support the Chamber in its state level legislative and regulatory agenda. We’ve talked to Perianne Boring about the CDC side of things, now it’s time to invite Gide Principal Arika Pierce to give us some insight on her side of the merger. Gide, a public affairs consulting firm, set forth a mission to help startups that operate in highly regulated areas navigate government roadblocks. The digital currency industry is at a critical juncture as states such as California, North Carolina and New York start to create a regulatory framework that is not always friendly to the industry. Is the bitcoin brand disruptive? How do we deal with bitcoin’s identity crisis and if it is in fact disruptive, is bitcoins kind of disruption undisciplined or groundbreaking? That’s a rhetorical question for you, a real question for our guest. Understanding Misunderstandings. Got it?! Confused? Just click play and enjoy, friend.

I've been a bitcoiner for quite a while now...changed some mindsin my social circle, most tune out.  But, the minds that have jumped on this awesome bandwagon weren't exactly open-minded.  I was difficult, consistent, persistant, and articulate and I have managed to show quite a few people about the awesomeness that is bitcoin.  I wrote a blog about it, call it moral support for the community.

Agreed. Crypto-anarchy was a good start to bootstrap Bitcoin into relevance. But, if people did just a tiny bit of critical thought they should realize that most civilized regions didn't get that way through anarchy. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 23:27:16
I don't think humanity can ever reallly achieve that.  I think that ever so often technological innovation allows for a redistribution of wealth, but in general, there will always be a large group of people that don't care about wealth, or don't excercise the neccessary practices to build it on their own.  
I think bitcoin is the former example, it is an innovation that will allow for a massive redistribution should it reach its potential on a golden timeline.
@_date: 2015-11-28 18:14:21
Congratulations on the milestone. Great company, great vision.

That's a good question. I've used Lawnmower almost since its release. My threshold is $20 in change but the debit from my account is $.50 to $1 over $20, so I would venture a guess that they make a small amount in the fees from coinbase.
would you care to set the record straight on your biz? Or, is it a trade secret?

We revisit the adult industry this week by featuring upscale London escort agency Fallen Angels. We had a chat with Miss Silvia’s trusted colleague Coco, who provided us with great insight on how this industry + bitcoin go hand in hand. Upon finding out about bitcoin, she told her girls and their travelling clients to use it. This worked out to be best method of value transfer for the sugar daddies indulging in polygamy. The benefits of using Bitcoin were greater for them then the traditional method so much so that they decided to make it their preferred method of payment. Using Bitcoins for high-end escorts could have a huge impact on its overall popularity. Who says humanity’s oldest industry shouldn’t be the one to propel Bitcoin into the future? Giggity Giggity Goo!

We just realized that we are in the first dual revolution since 1848! How so? Well, we will tell you! This week, the CTO of iNation, Christian Saucier, designed something to let users submit documents to the blockchain where they can be held securely. This might sound mundane, but it really isn’t. With it, users will be able to keep a perfect copy of their passport or deed or will or other legal document in a cryptographically secure place, and be able to access it at anytime using a mobile app. Doesn’t that just blow your hair back? He is an energetic business leader, software engineer, futurist, and early bitcoin adopter with over 20 years of experience bringing together teams who design and implement impactful IT solutions for Fortune 100 companies. We chat about The Byzantine Generals’ Problem, as well as why giving your dad bitcoin for his birthday is the most disappointing gift of all-time.

Round up your everyday purchases, invest the spare change into bitcoin, and live your life happy. It’s a nice slow n’ steady way to accumulate the immortal coin of the almighty. These guys were cool enough to be one of our first guests and they’ve come back to tell us a bit about how they now support thousands of additional banks and credit unions which means those of you who haven’t signed up yet now have no excuse.

Real-time bitcoin-to-gold exchange and banking 2.0 Vaultoro has reached a significant $2 million milestone in gold trading volume, recording an average monthly trading growth rate of 91 percent. Vaultoro enables anyone to easily enter the global economy securely and privately by utilizing the native Internet currency bitcoin and removing the extreme volatility by combining the security of assigned gold bullion. This will go a long way towards ending poverty by including a potential 5 billion people who have been left behind by traditional banking. Well hot damn! CEO Joshua Scigala joins us on the show this week as we dive further into his personal bitcoin story. Gold is a great way to preserve wealth, but it is hard to move around.

Bitcoin is a major technological advancement by being able to perform distributed consensus and programmable trust.

A Decentralized autonomous organizations (“DAO”) is a new type of organization, best comparable to a digital company, but without an attached legal entity. Slock.it UG is a Blockchain + IoT solutions company. With that in mind they have built a fully decentralized, 100% free and open source DAO framework for the world to enjoy. It disrupts the billion dollar disruptors by enabling anyone to rent, sell or share their property without middleman. With Slock.it, the unused bicycle in the shed gets a new lease on life. Parking spots can be sublet on demand. Airbnb apartments become fully automated, wifi routers can be rented on demand and unused office spaces get a new lease on life. It’s the future infrastructure of the Sharing Economy. Co-Founder &amp; COO, Stephan Tual, joins us in the studio to talk shop!

Bitcoin has mesmerized academics, computer scientists and economists alike, for cutting out the PayPals and governments usually required for digital money. Enter: Ledger. A peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes full-length original research articles on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, as well as any relevant intersections with mathematics, computer science, engineering, law, and economics. Right on the heel of their inaugural issue of the very first peer-reviewed academic publication, we chat with managing editors, Prof. Christopher E.

Nope. Sorry. We will NOT forgive your ignorance. If you’ve known about The DAO for a few months and read the website and other materials and you still don’t “get it”, then we pity you. Steven Mckie, from Yours, joins the roundtable to break it down for you. TLI5 style. In addition, we invite Jesse Powell the Co-founder of Kraken, which is a digital asset exchange with support for Bitcoin, Ethereum (ether), Litecoin, and etc. We chat about being selected to aid MtGox liquidation and accepting MtGox bankruptcy claims. We also get an update on possible acquisitions. Because being the world’s largest bitcoin exchange in euro volume and liquidity isn’t enough! After fully absorbing both Coinsetter and Cavirtex brand, they are ready to acquire more. More rollup; fewer exchanges. That’s the idea!
@_date: 2015-11-15 22:43:30

Back in 1999, the price tag of $199 could have secured you a Sega Dreamcast. Fast forward 16 years later, that same price point can acquire a physical bitcoin wallet the size of a credit card. Integrated with a little screen, a camera, a fingerprint sensor (yes, biometric authentication) and a few buttons, Case wallet is capable of executing transactions by itself. Featuring a GSM embedded chip, Case doesn’t rely on phones or computers for internet access, being able to directly sign and broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network. Talk about innovation, right? Hell, even Dreamcasts were stocked with a 56k modem. That was a big deal 16 years ago, folks! Anywho, CEO Melanie Shapiro swings by to talk about the product and the usual ridiculous shenanigans you come to know and love. Episode 25 baby! Strap in.

What I am trying to say is that true disruption introduces a new culture.  Smartphones introduced a new culture for communication.  Netflix introduced a new culture for on demand entertainment.  Hell, even way back to microwaves introduced a new culture for meal preperation.  Bitcoin introduces a new way to think about money.  Yes that is awesome, and yes I have completely bought in and agree that it shits on any fiat currency.  However, the aforementioned disruptions also made things easier for people.
