It isn't a sustainable business model. You can't build a company around this speculative bubble. Also, when the shoe drops and everyone has lost all their money they will be angry and blame those who made money on crypto.

No. Never. This is a currency, or it may be a currency one day. Stop speculating!

In other news, everyone who ever ate food eventually died. Time for bitfood.

That's not how this works. "Making" extra money doesn't add value to the economy. The government can just print $140bil as an analogy, but that does harm to everyone except the one printing the money. Crypto only has value as a means of exchange, but it is only very rarely used for that and there are more efficient methods for most transactions. 
I think that crypto will eventually be of value and use to society, but right now it is extremely limited in the value it imparts. And it absolutely is NOT imparting 10's of billions of dollars of value into the economy. Just because speculators drive up the price of Beanie Babies doesn't mean they are magically better than a normal toy, especially when everyone can see that the price is artificial and will collapse eventually.

Why would you buy BTC? It is overvalued.

Sure. Geometric average
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:31:18
Nah. What you're posting is similar to standard deviation.

Same path as the internet. Right. /s
At least with the dot com bubble there were actual people using the internet. There were websites and email and infrastructure and content - it was more than just brokerages and stock exchanges.

The geometric mean of $0 and $1.2mil is 
(0 x 1200000)^0.5
which evaluates to $0.

Look no farther than crypto forums to see that it's failed. No one is using this as a means of exchange, only as a speculative investment based on promises of adoption that have thus far not been realized in 7+ years.

Welp, all the money that can go into this bubble has gone in. Bitcoin is fully saturated with speculators. Time for the crash to happen, after which blockchain can finally start to mature into something useful.

Just to add - the "shitbox" thing is a cheap, reliable car.

The coins that should never have had high value include Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:42:52
Where is the line about speculators crowding out the space so that bitcoin can't be used as a means of exchange?
@_date: 2018-04-09 04:44:38
People are negative because there is no reason for bitcoin to be valued over $100. It will not ever be largely adopted. Crypto likely has a long future, and may eventually replace fiat, but it won't be bitcoin that does it. If bitcoin was going to be widely accepted as a means of exchange it would have happened this past year. Instead it is just speculators trying to make money and hilariously drinking their own hodl coolaid. 
These forums give the clearest indication of why bitcoin has failed. The posts are all about bitcoin as an investment vehicle, and not about using the coin to facilitate transactions.

It's hard to call Bitcoin a "currency." It's like calling Beanie Babies "kids' toys."

No. For a word to have value as a means of communication it must have a shared definition. If each person could define what a word means to them then language ceases to have value.
