Where do you live. Here at my place we can find people  and meet up at the mall for example to exchange. Ofc for a small fee but nothing else is involved. Just google search exchange bitcoin in "your town"

Just funny to see people that already have 1M and still betting

Just for safety ��

No regulations that's the problem. The big sharks are afraid of the change. Long live the system!!!
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:57:34
Yes nothing to worry about but this is just the beginning  . I predict 1 week ques  in the next year. We are still lucky now :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:41:44
XD what if you are in the middle . 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:13:20
Use your own computer when doing transactions.
Do not keep your wallet address and its private key at the same location.
Use an updated online wallet software.
If possible, use multiple wallets.
Always have a backup of your wallet in an offline drive.
Just in case your mobile or laptop is stolen or lost, having an offline backup of your wallet can protect you and your bitcoin.
7. Consider using wallet encryption.
Want to set a password for anyone who wants to steal your funds? Then you should do wallet encryption. Protect your account from thieves.
8. Set a strong password.

Expect nudes �� when you share an e-mail like that. But yes I will help. Good luck with your project!

We all can see the pattern here... and who doesn't love Banks. �� 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:44:42
Yep we need all the shite.. in one place xD
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:48:25
You are fast
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:23:23
I already did that with all my friends ... including my parents and that was the hard part....
Seems some open-minded companies probably have the same idea.. Here check [this news](
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:19:06
I agree with . Still coinbase it safe. Expect long ques when you transfer. (2 days or more)
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:25:02
Yeah keep a copy of it ... you never know when you'll want your gift back��
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:28:00
Time to buy guys now it's the moment xD
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:21
Is doing down fine  xD
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:23:48
Well said my friend. The best way to scam nowadays is using bitcoin.com advertising all you have to do is pay 2k for a press release and that's it....
And why not because it's legit right?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:23:26
Easy bet for them indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:53:56

Is it just me or when you look at the image it's actually moving
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:49:23
Not healthy when i'm checking my wallet xD
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:40:00
Yeah it's nasty but [it's in the news]( so it must be true.

Hope he will not share the faith of the last opposition leader ����
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:34:34
Just wait a few more months and you will see the drama. Not a good idea at all.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:20:14
Always spend what you have invested in the first place . The rest is just bonus and it all depends on your goals and how greedy you are. But at least if something happens and the bubble burst you have nothing to be sorry for.

I'm just waiting for the Big Bang. Tempting right now but way too risky .

A Man of Culture ��  I like you

It's probably the beer but in full screen it's actually rotating ��
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:29:52
Bitcoin Futures, cryptomania and the Herd behavior . The rest is speculation.

It's hours let's all wait here open that champagne. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:37:33
I don't want to be the next pizza guy so why risk it xd

@_date: 2017-12-15 15:45:10
My eyes hurt ... just looking at it
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:26
Does't feel like that for me. Bitcoin value went to 19k in 1 month. What is happening now doesn't feel like a bubble burst.... just a natural and expected correction.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:58:48
You would be surprised.  Don't forget the  “Nigerian” Email Scams are here to stay and all the "Change your Paypal password" emails still work like a charm. Sad but true

I had a really hard time 2 years ago trying to convince my cousin that he didn't won $10.000.000 from a Coca Cola event. xD

I think that's what Google said about Facebook in the 1st place. But probably all the big players are just a bit afraid of the buzz...
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:56:20
Totally agree... Bitcoin failed for Steam also. 
According to Valve, there have been many cases where users have placed an order, but until the check-out and actual Bitcoin payment was processed, the price of the game was completely different.

That's the Christmas spirit xD
