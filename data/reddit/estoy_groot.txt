Wait... So I have some Bitcoin in cold storage from like 2014. That means I have Bitcoin cash I can sell for more Bitcoin?

Unoriginal and overpriced in my opinion. I'd never spend $40 for a hoodie from a no-name brand with a design that just copies an overused trend. It's basically the equivalent of the "keep calm and..." design. Except this is copying Trump which makes it even dumber to me.

Are you new here? Everyone knew that climb was artificial and shouldn't have happened so fast. Look at actual stats of it's value over time and not just how it randomly shot up to 20k from 6k and then re-corrected.

This will probably sound stupid as hell, but you say transfer it to an exchange.... But where does it exist at? Do I import my old Bitcoin to a Bitcoin cash wallet or something first?

I'm only on 7. I guess it's coming soon for me.

Just shows up as a box with an X on Android.

Wasn't Bitcoin only worth like 1,000 a year ago? That means it's worth like 7,000 more than it was last year. Doesn't depreciating mean it loses value?

Oh I know... I just wanted OP to think critically about how they couldnt actually have been banned if they were able to make a post.
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:39:50
If you were banned from posting... then how did you post this?

You have to register and scan your ID. My transaction took 25 minutes to go through.
