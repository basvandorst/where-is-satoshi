This has concerned me. Being an early adopter who originally got into Bitcoin as a way to play poker online after the US made that a difficult thing to do, I have a mental picture of the IRS absolutely freaking out when I finally do convert to fiat. Who knows what activities the addresses of the coins I have will be associated with. And I don't relish the thought of my money being seized, and my being left in a position where I am going to have to try and prove my innocence.
*(Note - Playing poker online was never made illegal in the US. What was outlawed was banks or credit card companies transferring the money used to so. So as a consequence, most sites stopped accepting American players.)*

This guy completely fails to understand the bedrock upon which crypto currency is built - consensus. That is what Bitcoin embodies (as well as improving technology, great developers, etc.). If the day ever comes when we move wholesale from one coin to the next based on some faddish notion of "better", crypto will not survive.
*Translated - In actuality I believe this poster and his ICO pushing ilk are not about "better" at all. They are really just greedy and impatient Roger Ver wannabes looking to sabotage Bitcoin, and get rich quick picking over its corpse.*

I completely disagree. Anything that is good for altcoins is bad for Bitcoin. We are hoping that a single new 'World Reserve Currency ' is being created with Bitcoin. And having instead a never ending series altcoin rainbows for people to greedily chase after can only distract from that goal. It won't be government regulation, or market manipulation etc. that kills decentralized, deflationary and censorship resistant crypto-currency. It will be the fragmenting of consensus.

Thanks for the (probably good) advice. This is something everyone should be a little worried about, though. I'm not an expert, but I have seen what crazy ass profiles and conclusions software like this can come up with. It's almost comical at times. For instance Google has me pegged as an elderly, menopausal women. When that's as wrong as it can be. (I suppose because of searches and purchases I often make for my computer illiterate mother?)
These kinds of programs will absolutely be generating huge amounts of false positives. And I foresee some innocent Bitcoin users getting screwed.

Here's one thing I'm confused about. There are going to be thousands of people and businesses on "a channel", yet any one of these people or businesses can close the channel? That can't be right. I take that "closing a channel" refers to one person leaving it and being reimbursed (closing it for themselves), but the channel itself still remains in operation?

Or will it be flavor of the month. With every shift in sentiment further eroding the confidence people have in crypto in general. Just how do think people are going to feel when one of these changes take place (in a matter of only hours, perhaps), and they are the ones left holding the bag?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:01:43
I think they're afraid of Bitcoin becoming a more attractive saving/investment vehicle than gold is, or even stocks and bonds etc. are, and that investment money - which is now going to build schools, build hospitals, line the pockets of over-payed bankers, or whatever - may start flowing to some kind of a new age digital black hole instead. But also, I keep flashing back to the perhaps not well known fact that gold itself has sometimes been seen as a threat to government control. And that it was actually unlawful for Americans to own gold from 1933 to 1964.

This is all a nice thought, but what if instead the psychopath Roger Ver and his Chinese crime syndicate partners have actually been making fortunes during these pump and dump attacks? And what if they are not leaving at all, but in fact just getting warmed up?

And blocksize will increase when the community reaches consensus on it. But supporting outcast rebels who have visions of setting themselves up as the new 'Rulers of Bitcoin' is not going to fly. Nor should it.

One thing here is the size of Bitcoin's market cap. I see just from reading the headlines on this sub right now that Bitcoin is the  currency in the world. And for example has more value in circulation than the British pound. I wonder how seriously even institutions like the CME are going to be able to influence that kind of a market.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:07:25
What if lending, investment, and spending really are the cornerstones of a modern, advanced society.
And suppose you take to be true the theory that all of these require a "stable" platform - in the form of a currency - to operate properly around. For instance with Bitcoin, how could you take out a loan to build a new hospital with if you couldn't reliably predict the amount of actual value it would take to repay it? Or with a deflationary currency, why would you want to loan the money in the first place if holding on to it was likely to pay a greater return than lending it?
I'm just saying. And as a holder of BTC, I'm trying to foresee what government policies and regulations might be coming down the road.

Prosecute, probably not. But how about some good old fashion retaliation? For one, let's all stop using Coinbase and GDAX, and start calling out here as a traitor anyone who mentions doing so.
JUST SAY NO TO TO COINBASE/GDAX !
SAY NO TO SCAMBASE/GSCAM !
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:59:47
Yes, and this could be one way. Bitcoin has already been declared by the IRS to be "property", and a law is being drafted right now requiring all Americans to declare all their Bitcoin holdings. So perhaps states will take the cue, and holders will be required to pay annual property tax on their Bitcoin.

Just coincidentally, they would also be "laying the groundwork" needed to seize your Bitcoin should they ever want to outlaw it (for example much as the US government [criminalized Americans owning gold]( from 1933 to 1964).
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:55:50
I've been wondering about the Chinese government being actively involved in this recent episode of market manipulation myself. But no matter what the answer to that question is, anyone supporting Bcash is absolutely aiding and abetting the transfer of control of Bitcoin to a nakedly criminal cabal; and one quite likely partnered with a hostile and non democratic foreign power as well. So the way I'm coming to see it, BCH supporters have now become little more than traitors. Traitors not only to the cause of those wanting a decentralized currency free from undue influence, but also perhaps even traitors to the democratic free world.

And why weren't you making this argument a few days ago? Instead I see this:
*"It's 12.5k because it's an entirely new asset class for a new century that has unique attributes that are similar to gold and other precious metals."*
Pfft, weak hands like you need to be in savings bonds. Be gone.

Exactly what piece of information being presented in this article, and there was a lot of it, are you taking exception to? Because personally, what I'd like people to stop posting is whiny ass complaints, not backed by one shred of argument or evidence. Put up or shut up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:24:40


I'm not an economist, but the stability of a currency also seems to me to be something of real importance. And that means both in terms of potential inflation or deflation (one condition unfairly rewards the borrower, the other the lender; one the employer, the other the employee; one the buyer, the other the seller; etc.). And I'm not sure I find your arguments here convincing. Bitcoin seems by design to be strongly deflationary, and designed to remain so even after something approaching equilibrium is reached.
But a more important reason I still have some doubts about Bitcoin is the way it is being distributed - by benefiting  only the people who buy in early, entirely at the expense of those who buy in late. Is that really the kind of social justice we desire in the new era? Is it really a sound basis for reward that should be defended?

Ledger does not use a "tamper" seal on their boxes anymore. Verification apparently is done through an online software check of some sort. This information is on their website.

IMO Bitcoin is not so much about technology, as it is about consensus (although the technology of Bitcoin itself is also improving with LN and Segwit). Therefore every dollar the price goes up, is another vote saying your opinion is wrong. And this year - or indeed for nearly a decade now - the consensus has been literally screaming that you're a bloody fool. But god bless you anyway, keep telling me the earth is flat.

For people willing to pay their capital gains taxes (as you should be), buying and selling at one of the three exchanges based in the US that are regulated by the State of New York might be a good idea. I believe these are Gemini, bitFlyer (the US offices just recently opened), and itBit. As for which if any of these allow short selling, trade alt. coins, etc. I forget. Day trading and alt. coins are not my thing. You'll have to check that out yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:48:58
I don't think it's a designed agenda. It's simply a lot of ordinary holders wondering if the government or the big banks are going to come in and step on them like a bug. And if Bitcoin does indeed become a threat to these institutions, I happen to think that is a very real possibility.
Did you read this article posted yesterday about the Senate's proposed bill to criminalize the concealed ownership of bitcoin (i.e. you would be required to declare/register all your holdings)?

I didn't assume that. What I did assume was that other countries have tax requirements as well, and that these three exchanges are all operating under a stringent regulatory environment. So your activities are going to be reported. But on the other hand, these regulations can work to peoples advantage as well. No matter what country they are from. I believe all these exchanges do consider themselves to be "international".

No personal information required as long as you are trading only in Ecoins. Selling for fiat currency, though, you do have to fill out the forms. Buying with fiat? I'm not sure. But you are presumably going to be using a traceable card or something anyway.

Yes, people may not know that the largest Japanese bitcoin exchange, BitFlyer, just opened a US office (Google BitFlyer + US). They are also having an introductory sale on fees right now. It will be interesting to see what kind of a reputation they develop here.

Dream on.
*The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 outlawed most private possession of gold, forcing individuals to sell it to the Treasury...made it a criminal offense for U.S. citizens to own or trade gold anywhere in the world, with exceptions for some jewelry and collector's coins. These prohibitions were relaxed starting in 1964.*

No, if the developers BTrash had been in any way honest they would have never used the name "Bitcoin" at all for their new alt-coin. That fact alone brands these guys as scammers. So good luck signing on with them. Personally, I have no doubt at all that you're going to get reamed.

I don't see this as a cautionary tale about people buying into a (potentially) failing alt-coin, but rather about the dangers of trying to time and short term "trade" any kind of a big market. Also, as someone who's been saving and investing for many years now, I'm worried about you younger people thinking that these kinds of returns the bitcoin market has been experiencing are anything more than an historic fluke. And something which can't possibly last. For example, you do know that the averaged **annual** rate of return on investment in the fairly dangerous stock market over the last 100 years or so has been around 8%, right? 
But anyway, enjoy it while it lasts. I sure have been. It's been absolutely amazing. (I bought my coins just to play poker with at around the $2.50 per level, and then managed to do some winning at the tables after that. But good god, if only I'd been wise enough to make a true investment unit size purchase at the time - which I could have easily done.)
