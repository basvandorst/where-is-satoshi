So essentially, the changes with regards to double spend are only significant if people place undue trust in them, but make no alteration to the ~10 minute confirmations we currently rely on? If true, the 2 significant changes in XT from Core 0.10.2 would be the increased max block size and the split of development teams (putting faith in Gavin et al. over that in Blockstream)
The reason I would call XT a beta branch if the max block size issue were addressed in core is that it would remove the reason people have for migrating to XT, making it unlikely ever to reach the point where a hard fork would occur unless some aspect of Core significantly rubbed the user base the wrong way.
Lightning seems to be a proposed improvement on multisig which is currently in draft phase and if successfully implemented, a good solution to massively reducing the size of the blockchain, but even under those circumstances would it not still make sense to have an adaptable max block size which would take in to account the possibility of a sudden influx of legitimate on chain transactions?
I ask about the team controlling Core primarily to ascertain whether it is about to fall under the total control of Blockstream. It might help people decide where to place their faith if they knew better who they were placing it with.
I suggest a new currency (at the very least as a testbed for the proposed changes to Core) as if we are to deviate from the whitepaper it would reassure the Bitcoin user base in accepting those changes once proven effective.

So for now I guess we have a PR battle going on, and we all just have to hope that neither 'team' does anything rash (cause an irreversible fork) at the very least until any major changes are finalized and we're all a bit clearer about what those changes will be. Good luck everyone, may the most decentralized implementation prevail! Thanks for helping me simplify the positions as much as possible luke.

Thanks for the linkage - FYI I don't personally know any of the individuals on the dev teams, and wrote that article as a result of it not being too easy to at a glance figure out what was going on. I think perhaps Gavin has expressed support for XT as a means of convincing the core team to agree on some important issues they've failed to which have been apparent since at least 2011. I have had some limited contact with luke-jr on github and I used eligius.st but I am not declaring support for any team or individual in this. I do believe however that there are significant issues that need to be addressed, and that a raised max block size (even were it 2MB rather than 20) would be best for now, and the issues regarding maintaining decentralization and/or implementing sidechains should be explored fully, but not immediately forced upon us.

Thanks for the response luke, I will update to address and clarify on that, however from what I've read (and I'm not as in the loop as I have been) it doesn't seem that clear cut. Mike Hearn certainly set up the other github some time ago, although it attributes the double spend relaying to Gavin Andresen and Tom Harding. It freely admits not to completely solve the double spend issue, but aims to improve it, could you please expand on the advantages/disadvantages of the implementation proposed in XT?
As far as I can tell, supporters of the changes in XT are willing to allow for increased data usage in order to allow for increased usage of Bitcoin in the short term, whereas the opposition would prefer to allow necessary transaction fees to rise as we approach/hit the max block size ceiling for transactions to be successful on the basis that such data requirements would cause increased centralization. But as it stands we don't have an accepted viable alternative - only a brief whitepaper on sidechains which leaves a lot to the imagination, and would require a significant period of testing and some real world implementation before the community would trust it, and I'm sure you're aware of the fears that Blockstream may result in centralization - can you do anything to allay those? 
Gavin also seems to be claiming that his support for the increase in max block size and to a lesser extent the other changes in XT are a call for action on the part of the Core team to adopt some change to max block size whether set specifically or adaptive as that change on it's own is not a deviation from the initial spec of Bitcoin. Surely if that minor change were implemented the risk of a hard fork to XT would be drastically reduced, and it's role limited to a a beta branch of Core?
Regarding the fork, as long as the Core protocol doesn't change significantly and XT doesn't reach 90% adoption it's not going to happen, right? Can we get some clarification on the future of the Core - for instance, is Gavin still going to have influence on it?
I would agree that just allowing the max block size to increase indefinitely is fraught with problems, but problems that are a way down the road and also not a deviation from the Bitcoin whitepaper. For that reason I wonder why Blockstream don't start their own cryptocurrency to start pegging sidestreams to?

Thanks for your feedback. I use devices with linux on little pi-like boards, however those devices run cgminer or bfgminer and I like to monitor them all in one place - on my Mac.
MacMiner has been around a while and the github page can give you an idea of the work that has gone in to it so far. I will take your advice and improve the appearance of the kickstarter page and make sure it links back to a mention on the official MacMiner website!

it will always remain open source, here is the code:

I agree based on historical trends that if Bitcoin successfully moves from 'startup' phase to 'industrial' phase it's looking as though we're not that far away from another crazy rally, but I don't see how that would make mining profitable on a small scale without free electricity.

What brand of miners? If USB then yes, and MacMiner will interface with an app called MobileMiner (not affiliated) which allows you to monitor, start and stop mining from your phone.
If they're miners that connect to a network rather than a USB port then you can monitor them in MacMiner, but will not be able to control them and it's likely that the temperature information will not show up for them, despite being displayed in each unit's web interface.

I just stopped working on MacMiner - is there a good open source iOS wallet to contribute to? (on Github)
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:42:26
The web interface, or commands sent to each miner via it's listening port on it's IP address if it runs bfgminer or cgminer
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:22:05
bfgminer hasn't been seeing as many updates lately, and I wonder whether there's a future for open source miners. It also can't really be run in conjunction with cgminer due to USB conflicts. I don't see a non-industrial market for miners dominated by ASIC, and can any alt currency truly prevent that? MultiMiner and it's developer are great but (at least as far as Mac OS is concerned) a little more technically involved to run. That's probably a good thing, given the direction of the wind.
