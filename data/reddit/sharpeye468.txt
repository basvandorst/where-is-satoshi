OHohoho. A real gambler 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:49:46
Ouch. I'm really sorry to hear this man.
@_date: 2016-08-19 22:32:23
Yeah your 4 month old child also didn't lose thousands of dollars
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:41:38
Try me
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:35:38
I've had it wait to sync if I've done transactions from another computer.
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:06:49
Well damn. They saw the paypal came from china? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:31:14
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-08-09 03:09:42
I'd love to know the answer too, this one was interesting.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:50:10
No japanese this time (I'm hoping, but I do enjoy the puzzle!)
@_date: 2016-08-09 03:28:24




So nothing we really could have gotten lmao.
@_date: 2016-08-22 21:41:13
Cripes, you accidentally deposited 1.739 BTC to a wrong wallet? I'd be double and triple checking.
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:43:04
70 million? Did I miss something? I thought it was only around 120,000.
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:22:27
Oh boy, its one of those bank types. Honestly though I have no idea why they wouldn't accept paypal deposits. Oh well. I guess I can't help you here.

After the nearly two hour delay there were a few blocks found and then 3 within the span of 1 minute 30 seconds. I don't really know what this means because I am new to bitcoin can someone explain this to me?
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:02:51
For me, it was in view only mode because I opened it to a new computer, you'd need to put in your 13 word (or so) generation seed that would have come up when you made the wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:06:51
Couple things possible here: 
1. The bitcoin hasn't been confirmed yet
2. Your wallet hasn't synchronized properly yet
3. You are in view only mode for the wallet.

I'm seeing 5$ sent to others and yer stiffin me. You think I'm untrustworthy *insert navy seal copypasta here* 
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:09:56
I would blame in part. They have 20k subs there and I believe that the sub is advertised on reddit (I went there first before finding this sub, idk if this one has ads or not).
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:03:05
You could always convert bitcoin into paypal, and then put the paypal into your bank account
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:47:22
We need to go deeper
@_date: 2016-08-22 21:06:27
It might not be in view mode, but the wallet might just need time to sync as well.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:36:44
Do I sense part 4 coming around??
@_date: 2016-08-12 03:34:02
What you talking about?
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:23:12
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:22:53
Wrong sub dude!
@_date: 2016-08-20 02:08:54
Could always try gambling it on sites.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:33:50
Just as a protip, that's not quite how it works. While I'm not sure how the whole chain is set up, you're not supposed to link to the last one right away
