Like how does he justify a though in his head like that? People like this got me off blockchain currencies all together...
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:13:09
Well that exactly what I am saying...  Bitcoin is just one currency using the same technology that enabled crypto currency. So it's not special.
And it can fail if other technical aspect of what developers behind it creates fail or public fails to adopt it.

Does anyone remember we were discussing if it would see 10k before the years end? No?
20k it is then...

@_date: 2017-12-11 12:12:51
Umm... well I did wonder about the same thing and checked the history on same exchanges and haven't seen any indication of price change after the latest halving. Do you mind showing me the increase?
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:44:56
Seriously excellent. Thanks for sharing this. It's great to hear sensible people talk the good and bad of this space and get insights from a traditional investor.

Dotcom was a bubble and did pop. Amazon, Google (and maybe even Apple(not really a .com but still..)),  survived but a lot of business' didn't, and neither does people's investment on them. 
Even the ones who survived took a long time to get back on track and recover losses, let alone making profits.
Bitcoin could be any of these companies. It could become the next Pets.com or it could be Amazon.com. 
But my personal beliefs is this absolutely is a bubble and buying crypto is a bet. 
Edit: 
I understand bitcoin is not a company, but it certainly is a currency amongst many other that uses Blockchain technology. So a competitor to similar ones in the same area. 
I am almost certain and willing to bet more than half of my savings that this technology will disturb many fields in the future, not just finance. 
However bitcoin being the first one doesn't make it innately successful. It's success going to be combination of the developer team behind it, surviving future attacks and eventual wide-spread adaption. It is still very likely some other currency to be more successful in the long run and either weaken or collapse bitcoins value. It might happen, it might not. It's a bet. (A safer one if you are technically savvy enough)
So I believe there is a close resemblance between the Dotcom bubble and today's cryptocurrencies.

What fork? There is no fork happening that I know...
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:30:09
It isn't, but it's success still depends on the people behind it (developers) and the adoption (users). So practically it's the same thing. 
It could thrive in the future or a major security flaw or general adoption could let it down and some other protocol could easily take over bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:18:44
Well, not really. Wall st traders thrive volatility. They can't make enough money on a stable market. 
I am pretty sure volatility is the number 1 reason they are getting into bitcoin market. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:31:04
I think he meant the name suited.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:37:32
Let's hug dude, I am clueless too...
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:04:41
Oh okay, excuse my ignorance, I am learning but how does reducing volume help them?
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:52:21
Well to be fair it is very high risk investment and he was right unless you were depositing an amount that you could effort to loose. Then it's fine.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:27:04
You said this an hour ago, now it's $9,500. I don't understand what's going on...
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:59:55
Fuck you I will do whatever I want.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:36:58
What happened there? We have had a huge dump of bitcoin. And it immediately recovered. I wish I understood what was happening...
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:51:50
'Didn't make money from bitcoin'... you realise only reason you here is to make fiat currency? 
Aim of bitcoin is to break fiat currency's stronghold and give people a decentralised currency. Not for you to buy low and sell high and go on with your life with fiat currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:37:46
Let's see if CME will help with that...
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:31:21
Thank you, my logic says you are right! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:04:06
I was just thinking this is too familiar to not to be in Melbourne...
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:08:26
You will also like watching it slowly erode when the crash comes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:01:43
Aaannnddd there comes the crash ...
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:35:38
I am more than okay with this. I think you have a great point of view! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:59:26
Oh there are people panic selling... I know because I am or was one of them. Got in around $5500 and panicked at bcash pump-dump dip, sold and bought bcash thinking I can make few quick bucks and get out, I did, untill I lost what I made plus 1/3 what I put in. Got back in around $6500 panicked at the next slightest dip sold and got back in at $7000. Basically I am exactly where I started except bitcoin rose about %40. I lost it all to bcash and trading fees. 
So yeah, inexperienced people like me here, I am sure panicking market forces...
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:08:08
Those walls can melt away due to 1 people tired of bitcoin edging 10k and taking profit at 99XX or 2people excited about run up after the 10k and deleting orders.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:25:26
Please tell me what to do next, did the opposite and lost $1800 lol, I am a true example of panicking market forces that you manipulate and grab the money from...
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:29:16
Most certainly, panicked and lost a lot of money lol.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:43:35
More on that please? Why do they dump? Don't new comers but and raise the price and this is good for investors?
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:36:56
Isn't this the guy who posted just about few weeks back that he was out and was gonna buy a Porsche with what he made out of bitcoin?
Or is that you and you are posting your own car?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:42:00
Gdax turned into matrix right now...
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:33:53
You are right except this time it became much more mainstream. Recovery might take much less time
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:37:51
One of them checking in...
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:39:34
Oh man this is damn scary! I have my bitcoin at an exchange to, this makes me wanna get some cold storage...
@_date: 2017-10-17 06:07:19
I agree with you. A currency is as valuable as demand makes it to be, I understand that but how about this:
According to google, total net wealth in the world is estimated around 250 Trillion dollars. ( just a google search, not sure if accurate)
Total bitcoin can ever exist 21 Million.
If *IF* bitcoin was the only currency left, wouldn't that make bitcoin worth just over $11.000 a piece? It's already over $5000 and not all the bitcoins are even mined. Doesn't this mean the bitcoin is already over valued?
I can't economics...
@_date: 2017-10-17 06:21:07
Whops, alright so that makes the value 1,100,00. Would that be right?
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:20:23
Can someone please ELI5 this? I though the fork was happening on the 25th? How come there are several version of the same software running? (As you can tell I have no idea what's going on...)
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:59:59
My friend told me you are not telling us the truth.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:10:11
Why not? Isn't that 'main stream acceptance we are waiting for?
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:19:48
I don't that's a great movie to cite from for bitcoin. You know they were a scam and ended up with zero.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:24:03
Lol dude, can we be friends? Story of my life...
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:56:56
I am not sure I am or you are missing anything, but if they had %51 consensus, they could do what ever they want: credit their selves bitcoins, how much ever they want, removes seize people's bitcoins... what ever they want. Trust is number 1 reason but coin is where it is right now. 
Because people trust their investment is worth something. And nobody can touch it, even governments.
Main reason bitcoin is created is to do away with central powers.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:28:37
Well patterns mean something when there is a backing. Patterns mean something with apple because they buy machinery, they hire engineers and they sell products, they have returns. Almost certainly it's not going to bankrupt over night. 
What's backing bitcoin: people believe it's going to be worth more then what it's worth today in the future. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:05:15
Umm, well this sounds big... are they going to start excepting bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-17 06:12:20
Help me with this:
According to google, total net wealth in the world is estimated around 250 Trillion dollars. ( just a google search, not sure if accurate)
Total bitcoin can ever exist 21 Million.
If *IF* bitcoin was the only currency left, wouldn't that make bitcoin worth just over $11.000 a piece? It's already over $5000 and not all the bitcoins are even mined. Doesn't this mean the bitcoin is already over valued?

@_date: 2017-10-17 06:34:10
Thanks yeah I missed that, English is not my native language.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:03:00
Ahh I see, thank you. But if bitcoin gold is on the 25th, what is 3 weeks away then?
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:47:29
Theoretically yes, but as soon as his btc starts moving, especially if it turns out he is cashing out bitcoin will tank because 1, over supply 2, trust issues. It's like a CEO unloading their shares. Makes people loose trust in the project. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:00:40
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:47:32
Oh dude, please find an answer to this question. I have no idea what's going on. It says 25th everywhere and individuals on here keep stating seemingly random and inconsistent dates...
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:28:38
Oh man it's so confusing I really don't blame people who trust bitcoin... but then again, it's not that much more complicated then other investments I guess.
