It is a good idea to educate people about cryptocurrancy and merch can help start a conversation. As an idea, Your merch site could accept crypto as payment method. Good luck mate :)

I know the feeling, Im living 1 hour in the future since 2month. People are trying to explain to me that it is the daylight saving time but i don't buy it. My watch never lied to me. I am hiding since then. Please help me find a way to get back into the past.

Woww that make a lot of sense. For sure he is the captain of the guardian of the time. He is gonna be real hard to capture because he is good at fighting. Maybe i should hide for the rest of my life...

Sorry for the delay, i was hidding and watching my house to see if everything was alright and found out that the police is searching for the other me (living one hour in the past), they think that he is just somewhere hidding.
But i think that he have been kidnapped by the time police. A guy in Camden told me about the time police, when you travel back in time they kidnap the other you to try to avoid to break the continuum space time because you cannot be at the same place in space and time as the other you. 
I think they might have take him 1h00 into the future and this is why i never have seen him.
I don't want to live and hide 1h00 in the past for the rest of  my life and this is why i have a plan. We need to find a time police first. 
Do you have any idea how we could catch one of them?
