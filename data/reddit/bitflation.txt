My reasoning for accepting Bitcoin would be:
* It's very easy to do
* It's legal
* It reduces financial support of payment systems that charge more than they need to (ie credit cards)
* It will lead to more donations than would otherwise be received
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:19:59
No, you don't need a single exchange; as long as exchanges readily allow funds (BTC and other currencies) to flow in and out, different exchanges will offer similar rates. Where they differ, people have the opportunity to make money through arbitrage, which reduces the difference.
When an exchange has a higher level of risk, or difficulty getting funds in and out, the price difference will be greater (eg MtGox).

@_date: 2014-03-11 01:21:44
It's worth noting that there's a substantial element of trust required because such systems can operate using fractional reserve ie they can spend (or lend) some of the deposited funds provided that they keep enough to continue processing withdrawals, that is, until they run out like MtGox did.
This means your bitcoins on coinbase aren't real bitcoins because you don't control the private key. Instead, they are essentially CoinbaseBitcoinCredits.

For every bit of wealth lost in the form of lost bitcoins, wealth is gained elsewhere by the holders of bitcoins. Overall, no wealth is lost. Such an event does create inequality (which is a bad thing), but it also teaches discipline (a good thing).

So the bankers would probably build efficient mining farms, and take most of that 4.4%... Instead of taking 4% of our spending (like they do now, with credit cards), they'll take 4%pa of our savings.

It's still a fork if even only one miner continues on the original blockchain, which is pretty much guaranteed.

My guess: hashpower will reduce by maybe 30%, average block solve time will be higher than 10 mins until next difficulty adjustment... exchange rate will jump by 10%, maybe with an additional short term spike (which could last a few days or a couple of weeks before returning to around $13-14). 
Of course, this is all speculation, and I'm not putting any money on it either way....
@_date: 2012-11-26 00:28:37
Why mine at a loss when you can buy bitcoins for less than the cost of running mining equipment? In either case, it sounds like you're counting on speculation to give a return, which is a completely different type of investment to mining for immediate profit. If one cares about the *current* profitability of mining, it's probably because the bitcoins mined will be sold in the short term. Hindsight is completely useless when it comes to speculation, other than as something to learn from.

I believe that is incorrect. You must spend *all* the funds from the inputs used in the transaction, which may be less than the total balance against an address (and may also include other addresses). 
For example you might receive 1BTC to address A, and 4BTC and 0.3BTC to address B, then you might spend 4.4BTC which uses the 4BTC and 1BTC transactions as inputs and uses outputs of 4.4BTC (to your destination address) and 0.6BTC to a fresh change address of yours.

The double spent transaction needs to be in the block before the 6-block chain mined by the attacker. Their attack would be rejected by the network before 6 confirmations nearly every time, so to avoid being noticed on every attempt they would need to withhold blocks until they get their 6 blocks in a row before the network gets it's 6 blocks.

The key risk of you missing out on your bitcoins when you don't wait for a confirmation is from a race attack. If the sender of the transaction issues a second transaction to the network which spends the same bitcoins, then there is a possibility the second transaction will be accepted by a miner and put into a block.
In my understanding, nearly every miner or mining pool will only accept the first transaction received for specific bitcoins and reject the second, though it is possible for the attacker to provide a larger transaction fee in the second transaction as an incentive for miners to include it instead.
The reality is that you'd only want to accept payment without confirmations for very small payments.

Does the site include an escrow service? (or will it have one in the near future?)
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:07:25
It's not a problem.
To achieve a double spend with 6 confirmations, my understanding is this: you need to withhold the first 5 blocks from the network until you mine the 6th block, without the network mining 6 blocks from the point in time that you started mining the first block of the 6. 
This means that, on average, you'd be withholding all block solutions for an entire week before you were successful. If you do this with 35% of the total network's hashpower, I calculate **the average cost of the attack at US$120/bitcoin to be US$1,058,400** because you miss out on all the other block rewards.
I would expect any party accepting a transaction of that size to wait for many more than 6 confirmations!
The miners in the pool would quickly get pretty upset too, with "luck" that bad.

I recommend you don't use that site. 
Last time I heard you need a minimum of 0.02BTC for a payout on that site and they charge a payout fee of 0.01BTC. It would probably take months to mine that much. The extra wear &amp; tear on your CPU will almost certainly exceed your earnings by many times if you do this.
I also understand the site can't use GPU's to mine, so even if you had a GPU suited for mining it wouldn't get used.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:25:41
It's not that simple. It's also a payment method that depends on publicity and adoption rates, both of which are sky high right now. But that said, it is probably still some kind of bubble; I just think it won't crash down to as low as say $50, unless something unexpected happens. It might crash down to $500 though.
@_date: 2013-05-22 00:09:47
It totally depends on how long it lasts, whether or not you're already running a PC 24/7, and how quickly the other ASIC manufacturers ship their devices. That said, I'm not buying any, as it seems like a high risk for very little chance of a good return.

If you receive 1BTC in a single transaction and then spend 0.5BTC in a single transaction, the remaining 0.5BTC gets sent to a fresh change address generated by the client. The change address is automatically generated, and the associated private key is stored in your wallet. As far as I'm aware you can't see change addresses from the GUI.
Some anonymity is provided because each change address is only used once.

My understanding is the complete opposite is true. HFT's manipulate the market, intentionally causing big spikes and dips because it makes them more profit.

Their reasoning: " the first people to receive BFL ASIC technology will have a decided advantage for a maximum of 2016 blocks". Well I guess that no longer really applies...

Looks like about 200khash/s for Bitcoin. Not sure about Litecoin.

Have you got something you can point me to to back this up? Note I'm not defending Litecoin; I'm just interested in the evidence either way. 
I am aware that Litecoin largely replicates Bitcoin's properties with the (primary?) difference being that it's CPU optimised. This would make it more profitable for botnets, which rings alarm bells for me, but I don't have evidence of the scale of the problem.

And $100 notes I understand are also favoured by criminals wanting to easily transfer wealth. They may well be interested in Bitcoin, though that's not an audience I would want to promote to.

There are successful businesses out there that make their money from providing services based on source code that they wrote but make freely available (within Gnu license limitations, or similar). 
When it comes to Bitcoin, security flaws can cost hundreds of thousands, so for any bit of code you're thinking of altering, it's sensible to get an expert to do the work. It makes a lot of sense to pay a 3rd party expert by the hour.

I'm not convinced it improves pricing; the prices and orders get manipulated to give a false impression of what the fair price is, and if you set a limit order to try to get a good price it's entirely likely a bot will undermine it by a thousandth of a cent within a short time, essentially reducing your liquidity.

This "lightning miner" is the device being referred to in a recent Bitcoin SE answer, which presumably has been voted down because it doesn't look legit:

Completely wrong about it being free, at least from a long term perspective. At some point miners will need to be paid through transaction fees.

One thing that I believed for a while was that the exchange rate would stabilise as more people began to use it. I no longer think that's completely true; just look at the size of the gold market (comparable because of the mostly fixed supply), and its substantial volatility. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:14:33
Bear in mind that Bitcoin is heavily manipulated by traders. However, the underlying value of Bitcoin as a payment method continues to increase while adoption levels increase. Media attention tends to drive adoption.
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:30:24
I don't think they undermine the bitcoin limit of 21m BTC any more than GPB undermines USD. 
However, they do each require a whole extra set of developers to maintain; it's a shame we aren't all working together, but at the same time I also recognise it's valuable to question the status quo and consider improved solutions.
As you say, they do make good "testnets". 
I wonder if anyone has studied the efficacy of these alternatives to see if they do actually improve on Bitcoin in any way. To do this, I think you'd need to measure various attributes of the network and how the network is actually used, such as:
 * Efficiency of data transfer (transactions per kilobyte)
 * Comfort levels of confirmation time (average confirmation time needed before a retailer commits to handing over the goods; this will differ based on transaction value)
 * Availability of 3rd party tools
 * Reliability of software
 * Disaster recovery capability
My guess would be that Bitcoin excels in the last 3 categories simply due to its dominance. There are probably other measures that would be useful too.

Apparently atmospheric friction is a myth; it's the compressed gas in front of a descending object that causes the heating. ie it'll burn one side, and leave the other raw (well, if it didn't catastrophically disintegrate)

Makes sense they don't want to ship new Jalapeno orders before meeting the orders for bigger devices, as it would upset their earlier customers even more. So it's going to be a long wait.

Adoption percentage rates are relative to the group being discussed. Where no group is specified, one might assume the group is "all people", "all people in developed countries" or perhaps "all US citizens". Given the worldwide nature of Bitcoin and ability to run on a cellphone, the group that really makes sense here is "all people", although high rates with either of the other groups would also mean success for the Bitcoin economy.
I doubt that Bitcoin will be something that nearly everyone uses, but that doesn't mean it can't be adopted by the majority.
I'm really just arguing a minor point of semantics; I too hope for high adoption rates, mainly because I dislike credit card companies extracting heavy fees and manipulating not just businesses but also nations to increase their market share.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:45:59
Are you aware of any quality material looking at the relationship between market size and volatility? ie how we can expect it to change as Bitcoin grows.

The two go hand in hand. More exposure to the public means more exposure and incentive for developers to add code to a site to accept them.

Surely the CIA has plenty of brainpower well trained in both cryptography and ASIC building... how much investment would it take to overwhelm the network? At least the amount of private ASIC mining equipment is increasing, so the threat of that may be decreasing over time.

Here's your correction: It matters what the *majority* uses. If the majority of clients reject a block, then that block will be orphaned. If your choice of software is in the minority, then you are potentially (at least temporarily) affected by the orphaned block, therefore an individual's choice of software can also have an effect. Primarily, it can make you vulnerable to a double spend.

The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks (2 weeks if mining power remains constant). The more mining power coming online, the sooner the difficulty adjusts, as the 2016 blocks will be mined in less than 2 weeks.

Technical analysis might work 90% of the time and gain you 5% each time, then fail 10% of the time and lose you 80% which makes all the gains and more disappear in one unexpected moment... in the end, those running the exchanges are the biggest winners.
