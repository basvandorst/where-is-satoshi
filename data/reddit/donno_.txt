It's really nice. So you can always get paid in bitcoin easily. I'm happy it's not your private key ;)

I think you’re right that I should order it now.
Anyway, I stick with TenX, thanks for the offer. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:59:42
I'll probably get a TenX card when they are ready to ship cards again. They already had working products so I'm confident they will do good work again.

Blockchain.info offers a mobile wallet that can do exactly that.
@_date: 2019-03-02 21:03:31
Wallets contain your private keys.
They are important!
The bitcoin are on the blockchain but you access it with the private keys.
“Wallets are just for moving coins.”
Yes, of course. With your wallet you access the coins. If you don’t have access to your coins, they are lost. So of course you can’t move them.
Everyone needs a wallet to store bitcoin.
A paper wallet is a wallet;
A hardware wallet is a wallet;
Even a Brian wallet is a wallet;
What would you do without a wallet?
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:32:47
Maybe he had coins on that seed before a fork and then sent the BTC after the fork.
The fork coins would still be on the seed addresses
@_date: 2019-03-02 21:09:18
Another reason is, you help other people run light clients.
If you have a bitcoin wallet on your phone it will not have a complete blockchain . It will connect to a full node and asks for some block information that contains his address information.
If there are many light nodes and just a few full nodes, the full nodes will need more upload bandwidth and the light nodes could have to wait more until the full node answers.
If you run a node and open ports, you can support other people who run mobile wallets (or wallet like electrum)

The Lightning Network implementations are in its early beta. There might be bugs which have not been discovered yet.  
Also, a node backup is not really possible yet. If your node crashes, for example your raspberry pi, it is a bit complicated to get your money back. i wrote a guide here [  
If you are offline for too long, your channel partners could cheat you and steal your money with broadcasting old channel states.  
All these points will be addressed in future releases. But at the moment you have to be careful as you could loose money if you don't know what you're doing.  
@_date: 2019-03-04 06:59:06
I am a big fan of the lightning network. I just want to make clear that there are still some risks. If you feel like you want to test the lightning network, feel free to try it. But don’t put more BTC on your lightning node than you need.
I don’t want that people loose money and loose faith in the lightning network.
Use the Lightning Network when you feel ready and start with a small amount :)

He's just asking for advise. You are the one, offering no benefit to society with your post.  
If he accepts Bitcoin donations, he is showing his followers that he believes in Bitcoin and sees it as something valuable. If he makes enough money to live on that, I believe he has quite many followers. Maybe some of them look into crypto because of him.  
u/i_gotta_say , are you making money on livestreams? If yes, would want to play a Bitcoin Lightning enabled demo game? Where viewers change the gameplay with they Bitcoin payments.

Recently my flat made unplugged my Bitcoin and Lightning node because she needed that socket. It felt like she stabbed me with a knife.
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:55:28
That's the point of this demo.
1. The money goes directly to the streamer. No third party involved.
2. Your donations alter the game. It makes tipping much more fun.  
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:31:39
It would be 24! if the order was completely random.
If you know that only 2/3/4 words are changed in sequence, the probability is much better.
However, if 4 words are changed in sequence it’s probably pretty hard as well. Definitely needs a computer trying that out.
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:43:50
I set up a full node to install a Lightning node on top of it.
At the moment you need a Bitcoin full node to run a Lightning full node. That will change in future 
@_date: 2019-03-19 04:19:05
In theory yes, but you need at least 50% of miners refusing that address. It’s against the number 1 rule of bitcoin (censorship resistance). Most miners will not do this.
Long version:
 The miner chooses which transactions to include into a block and can also choose not to include a specific transaction. If you are a miner, you can refuse the transaction from a criminal (for example).
But: Someone else can mine that transaction into a block. If you refuse his block and try to create a different block, you are creating a fork. The fork with the most hash power wins.
You would need to persuade at least 50% of all miners to refuse transactions from that address. That’s the only way how you can “freeze” a bitcoin address. Many people would not do this because it’s against the number 1 rule of bitcoin (censorship resistant). Also, how would you persuade more than 50% of all miners that this person is a criminal?
In theory it’s possible, but not probable.
@_date: 2019-03-03 00:31:59
Thanks for clarification :)
Does this mean if I replace my last word with one of the other words with correct checksum, I will receive the same BTC addresses?
Or if I have 23 words and don’t know the checksum, could I just take any valid checksum and get my bitcoin. It doesn’t matter which checksum I use?
@_date: 2019-03-04 07:56:13
Yeah, it is :D
@_date: 2019-03-03 21:29:55
Good to know!  
Thanks for the links  
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:52:02
You're welcome :)  
I also think so. There is much development going on!!  
@_date: 2019-03-02 22:05:19
I'm sorry, but I don't know what you want to tell me.  
I'm just saying, that wallets contain the information you need, to use your BTC.  
So they are important.  
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:42:50
This means 1 BTC would be worth 0.000038 USD.  
I already see all the headlines "Bitcoin crashed and is worthless".
\- How much is this new car?  
\- 580 million BTC! (actually meaning satoshis)  
\- Whaaaat? I buy it somewhere else (referring to todays measurement system)  
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:26:40
Ok, thanks :)
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:39:48
The last word is a checksum which means that probably the seed is invalid if you have the wrong order.
You could write a program which swaps 2 words in every possible way and check if the checksum is correct. If yes, try if that seed contains your fork coins.
Otherwise check with swapping the order of 3 words and so on. Obviously it gets exponentially harder the more words you swapped.
If i am not mistaken, the word list contains 2048 words (or 4096??)
This means on average every 2048 guesses, you will have a correct checksum although it might not be the correct order. In that case you would try the seed and see there are no coins.
Maybe you could check that with a program as well, but I wouldn’t know how to do that (especially with forks)
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:40:51
I heard of that but I thought it's not ready for mass adoption yet.

I'll be there this evening :) My name in the twitch chat is BR\_Robin.  
I don't know when he'll play PenguinShooter. He'll start playing another LN powered game where you can spawn monster with LN payments. I'm happy if you join in :)  
For the PenguinShooter payments you have to visit [penguinshooter.chickenkiller.com:8079](
It's offline now, but I'll run the webserver this evening when the stream starts.  
@_date: 2019-02-11 08:44:32
Im developing a LN powered game where you pay for ingame items with LN.
This evening on 11th Feb at 20:00 GMT, someone will play it live on twitch and the viewers can buy him upgrades or disturb him (freeze him steal his items etc.) with LN payments.
If you buy upgrades for him, money goes to the developer. If you buy handicaps, money goes to the streamer.
It’s not exactly what you’re asking for, but in future I would like to implement a multi player shooter, where you get rewarded for each kill.
For more info check out 
Or search for “PenguinShooter Bitcoin” on YouTube.

And one day your wife tells you: “Honey, I finally threw away that old rubbish that you kept in that room for so long. I’m going to do some aerobic there from now on”
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:55:50
I agree! If you use your seed which was on a hot wallet, it may already be compromised.
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:11:35
I want to correct something. If you are offline for a long time the channel will not force close automatically.
Your channel partner can force close the channel at any time, so also when you’re offline. If you and your channel partner do not close the channel, it will stay open forever.
The problem with the 144 blocks is something else: If you are offline and he broadcasts an old channel state, which might give him a higher and you a lower balance, then you can punish him with broadcasting the latest state and take all the money from the channel. But to do that you need to get only again in a specific time.
You can specify a time_lock_delta in your channels (which is often 144 blocks=1 day). Now you have 1 day to prove that the other party is cheating. Watch towers will help you punish the other party if you are offline for a long time. The other party could send an old channel state and then the watchtower could broadcast the penalty transaction for you. You don’t have to be only in that case. If the other party is honest and want to close the channel, then it will normally close and everything is ok
@_date: 2019-02-15 08:20:09
You and your channel partner have signed transactions from each other that send the BTC from that channel back to you depending on your channel balance.
In case of a Hard fork, this would be true on both chains.
In theory, if you both support both chains, you could use both LN channels on both chains.
Probably there will be one majority chain where you and your partner continue to use LN and one minority chain. You can just close your channel on the minority chain and use those coins onchain again.
@_date: 2019-02-13 07:02:39
It’s possible to send Milli Satohi. 0.001 Satoshi.
But I don’t know how this works. At least with LND
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:15:50
If you want to find articles and videos of how bad LN is, you can easily find them. There are definitely some problems and disadvantages at this early stage, but many people who say how bad it is, don’t really know it enough. Most negative articles I read and videos I watched were poorly researched 
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:13:13
I am using the LN and have my own node running and I’m developing a shooting game which uses LN payments to trigger ingame functions (
I’m a big believer in the Lightning Network. I think LN has a very bright future, but here I want to list some things that I think are not perfect at the moment. I could write many good thing, but for this reddit post I just concentrate on the negative side. I think it’s also fair to new lightning users to read what problems they could get.
For info, I’m using LND.
- backing up your LN channels is not possible at the moment. If your node crashes or your node is destroyed or whatever, you could loose money. Onchain you can backup easily with wallet.dat or 12 word seed.
- if you have 1BTC spread on several channels and one of your channel partners is offline, you can’t spend the whole 1BTC (unless you force close that channel and wait some time) Onchain you can always spend the full amount that you have. 
- let’s say you have 1.000.000 sat spread on 10 channels (100.000 sat each). ATM you can not pay more than 100.000 sat in each transaction (soon it will work to use several channels at once).
- Onchain you can post you BTC address and anyone can pay you anytime. In LN, at the moment you can only pay someone if he creates an invoice. And these invoices can expire. With Sphinx release in LND this will change.
- LN is getting easier for the average user more and more. But of course it is still more complicated than Onchain bitcoin. (With the wallets getting better, I am sure one day people will not even see a difference between them)
- If you have an own node, you should not be offline for too long, otherwise your counterparty could cheat you. This is not very likely because the counterparty risks a lot. Anyway it’s possible. With watchtowers this could change, but then you somehow rely on one or several third parties again. BTW, you could one day be a watchtower for your family and friends!
- Onchain you can use light wallets. This is what most people use. You have your own keys, but you don’t need to run a node 24/7.
In LN you either need to run a node (BTC and LN full node) or use a third party (you don’t own your keys).
This will change in future with neutrino wallets.
- LN is the second layer of bitcoin. Many people struggle to understand bitcoin and if they want to understand Lightning, they need to understand both. When wallets get better, maybe people don’t need to understand Lightning in order to use it, but in my opinion you should have a basic understanding on how it works.
I remember that I had problems to understand bitcoin. If a newbie gets into crypto and starts with LN without understanding bitcoin first, he could get himself into trouble. (Imagine all the people who lost money because they didn’t backup keys)
Probably many people have a different opinion on this. But I think understanding a second layer requires understanding the first layer first. This requires more time than concentrating on layer one.
- If you have a new node and you create channels, this doesn’t mean that you can receive money. You either need to spend money first, or people need to create channels to you. I have had a good experience. Many people create channels with me and about 60-70% of my capacity is inbound. But if you want to receive a lot of money (for example you have an online business) then you need people to create large or many channels to you.
I observed that people likely open channels to stores and services because it’s likely to route a payment to them, so I think it’s not a big problem. Anyway, I think it’s worth to mention it as an disadvantage.
-You can open a channel to someone and you pay the onchain fee. If you’re unlucky, the other party can close the channel again and you paid that fee (opening and closing transaction) for nothing. Didn’t happen to me yet, but could happen.
- You and your channel partner always recalculate the closing transaction fee. If the blockchain gets full and the fees rise, you and your partner may increase the fee of your closing transaction (in case someone wants to close the channel) and deduct it from your and your partners channel balance. It suddenly looks like you have less money (because some of your money is meant to be used as fee). If the onchain fees go down, your balance goes up again.
This means your total channel balance (the money you can use via LN) changes all the time. For newbies it looks like you lost money somehow.
I wanted to see how many people played my game and paid things with LN. The payments are mostly less then 100 satoshis. If I take a look at my balance and I see that it increased, i don’t know if it is because someone paid me or because of changed transaction fees. You have different options to see if you were paid, but the most obvious (see your total balance) is not reliable.

Most bitcoin holders use SPV wallets that need to connect to a full node to retrieve their blockchain data.
The more full nodes we have, the better the end user can download the info he needs. Doesn’t matter if he‘s mining or not.

I'm not able to integrate that, unfortunately. It's also good, otherwise I could just charge you too much and you wouldn't know it until it's too late.  
I tried to make it as fast as I could. You don't even need to click the QR code at the bottom right. You can just click "buy" (or click the "+" and "-" signs for the animals) and the invoice is already copied.

Blockchain.info also shows newly created coins.
Instead of an input of a transaction, it shows something like 
Newly created coins -&gt; (the address) 
If the address is empty, there are no coins at all (if you trust Blockchain.info)
I don’t know about other blockchain explorers.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:31:52
I think this will be a problem if we want to reach mass adoption. In theory it’s easy, you just give your relatives the access to a private key. But the problem is, whenever you change your wallet, you have to update...
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:24:08
With ingame payments you would actually tip me even faster, because I don't have to withdraw it from the reddit tipbot ;) And you could have bought some upgrades for your skills :)  
But thank you :)  
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:33:43
That’s wrong!!
The coins themselves are stored on the blockchain and you can always check their balance. 
You can store the private key offline that you need to take the coins. But the blockchain itself is always online. On the block explorer there is no difference between bitcoin stored in cold storage or hot wallets

The Lightning that you see is a skill.  
When you reach a certain lvl (I think it is lvl.5), open your inventory (press "I") and drag&amp;drop the skill in the shortcut panel. Select a target and press the shortcut.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you want to say about the tip bot. If you have a direct channel to them, you can also directly withdraw through that channel if you have enough capacity on the other side.
@_date: 2019-01-20 23:24:44
This project already took much much time. At the moment I don't plan a new project, but maybe continue working on PenguinShooter (maybe some multiplayer stuff, but that's in the far distance).
But if there is a good opportunity for something else, I am open to that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:00:20
Let's say I create another Bitcoin fork and I make people switch to my fork and leave BTC. They connect their nodes to my new node, starting mining the new forked coin and create a community around it. With this, they somehow make the new fork valuable. However they also devalue BTC because they abandon BTC. You can't really measure this devaluation, because the new community would be a joke to BTC, but at the tiniest stage BTC would loose a little bit of community. Look at the hard believers of BCH, who claim BCH is the real Bitcoin. It's a bit like a rivalry.
I also think it's difficult for new people to understand this. If I want to buy Bitcoin and suddenly see different versions of Bitcoin I might get worried and don't buy any.
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:29:24
They have to create a different address for every customer to know who sent the BTC. After that they resend them to different addresses.
If they just had one big address, they wouldn’t know where the money came from 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:25:36
Oh hehe, yes the tigers are very strong. You should have your own tiger to support you, or be lvl 13 at least ;)  
I thought you were talking about your own tiger before.  
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:25:59
AFAIK you can only use the same output addresses and increase the fees. Otherwise a double spend would be much easier.
@_date: 2018-03-13 08:43:28
I think it depends on the explorer you’re looking at.
For that purpose it would be perfect if you had your own full node so you could verify that without trusting a third party.
If you look at blockchain.info, you are trusting that website. However, if it’s not showing up on several explorers, I would be quite sure the address is empty.
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:35:03

@_date: 2018-02-12 05:20:55
If you jump in later you can also have many channels. You just have to open them.
One advantage of getting in early might be that more people will connect to your node because you are one of a few. And fees to open a channel are low at the moment.
But keep on mind that lightning is still in the testing phase. I would wait with using it until the developers call it safe.
Do you want to risk your money to collect a few satoshi fee?
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:52:45

@_date: 2018-02-15 15:11:44
Isn’t that the same as sharing your private key?
“Any participant can spend the funds by himself without the others being able to stop him”
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:29:05
I don’t have a full node. But in theory it should be possible because you have the full blockchain. If I’m wrong anybody can correct me.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:31:26
No, you put them in a channel that you open to another node.
Whenever you want, you can take them out without trusting the other one.
If you want to spend coins you transfer them inside the channel and still have control over the rest of the funds.
The worst that can happen is that the other node does not route your payment.
In that case you can close the channel to retrieve your funds and open another channel with someone else.
Better to create multiple channels right away.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:48:12
Well, I think it can be quite useful to store certain information inside a blockchain, knowing that no one can forge or change its history.
I can’t imagine sth like Facebook, Whatsapp or YouTube on a blockchain, but think of how a blockchain could change voting for a new government... No one can change votes of someone else 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:01:55
Don't ask me how exactly it works, but with the help of signatures and hashes it is somehow possible to create a trustless environment.
Imagine Alice is connected to Bob and Bob to Carole. Alice wants to pay Carole through Bob.
It's impossible for Bob to take the money from Alice and just keep it because he can just get the money from Alice if he proves that he paid Carole. It's impossible to steal the money as a middleman.
Like I said earlier, the only thing that can happen, is that Bob just refuses to forward the money to Carol which means Alice has to keep her money and is not able to pay Carole.
As long as you have enough channels opened with other people you should not have that problem.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:38:32
If we believe that BTC will rise in 2018, the amount of BTC you get for every 1000$ will get smaller and smaller. My guess is, there will be around 30 such dips until end of 2018 and you will have about 1.5 BTC which eventually cost you 20.000$ each (so you should better just buy them now ��)
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:51:35
I thought the same in the beginning.
I thought you can just copy and paste the bitcoins. I copy some to a USB stick, and sell the stick.. Then I send another copy to a friend per e-mail, and maybe even share them on facebook. Free copy of my bitcoins for everyone and I just keep the originals haha.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:34:57
When you pay a coffee or anything else for a friend in fiat and he pays you back with BTC over Lightning, that already is an example of real value. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:17:29
I don’t understand what you mean?
If you share the same private key to your family members, everyone will be able to take the money if he wants. When one of you dies or forgets or deletes the private key (or whatever), the others can still access the funds.
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:52:26
You are right. You already moved your BTC to a hardware wallet, so on your old address there are no BTC, there are just BCH, so your BTC are safe.
If you send you BCH to an exchange like Bittrex you can sell them for BTC and then send those BTC to your hardware wallet.
It is ridiculous that we got free money, but this doesn’t mean it is always like this. I would have never expected that BCH will be worth as much as BTC was a year ago.
You could also argue that BCH is no free money because “maybe” the current value of BCH would be on top of BTC if there had not been a fork.
So if there was no BCH, “maybe” BTC would be worth 10.000$ at the moment.

What I did last year: I created a paper wallet for my sister and changed the paper itself to a Christmas card with some nice text on it. So it didn’t look like a paper wallet in first case (a no-coiner wouldn’t even know what it was), but it had the private and public key on it.
I stored another copy of the private key for myself just in case she looses her key. Obviously this depends on trust.
Fun fact: She said my present was the worst ever, because it got less valuable every day ��

Many people who suggest you to spend your Bitcoins also tell you to buy back those spent Bitcoins. So after all, it shouldn’t make the price go down.
The thing is, people should see that you can use Bitcoin as money.
If my local bakery accepts Bitcoin and nobody uses it to pay, then the bakery will finally stop accepting Bitcoin. If you spend you BTC and rebuy, people start seeing that Bitcoin has real value.

Thanks for sharing your info. Probably everybody is routing via the same few hubs. At least this means that paying will stay cheap for a while. If hubs increase fees, people have plenty of options to route around.

I’m sure some people will try to attack something like that. People  brute force attackers perform several sha256 on a string and check their balance, so some might also try your approach.
Maybe it’s not likely that you are robbed, I still wouldn’t call it safe.

I followed the guide and it helped me a lot with setting up a LND node. The only part I couldn’t set up properly was the one with “mounting an external HDD” but I could make it work anyway.
Even though it worked well, it took me a long time because I had no idea of Linux (first time I used a raspberry) and an LND node in general.
IMHO it is not easy for non-tech people.
In Testnet I often had the problems that my node closed the channels because of changing fee on testnet. Even between my LND node on raspberry and my Eclair node on my laptop. But the channels worked, so it was ok!
I got all the bitcoin back (of course just the bitcoin on my side) and could use them again on chain.
Switching to mainnet was easier than I thought. It is basically the same but almost all my channels stay open. Just one closed and I got the bitcoin back onchain. I can also send BTC from my onchain LND wallet to a non-LND wallet without problems.
Mainnet is much more fun actually, but you need to pay more attention of course.
TLDR, Setting up a Lightning Node was not an easy topic for me, but with the Stadicus guide I was able to set it up. Now it works on mainnet and I am very happy.

As far as I know all channels along your path need those 1 BTC. But the developers are working on methods to split the payment among different routes which end up again at the end.  You can search for AMP

Thanks, I already thought it was wrong spelled while writing it haha

I think it’s a legit question. It happens to me quite often that I am low on battery.
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:04:12
Do you have Twitter, or another way we can follow your tour? :)
Anyway, I wish you all the best!!

Satoshi did a great work and if he’s still around I’m sure he’s very proud of it. If he still has access to his private keys, why would he (the creator of Bitcoin) change it back into Fiat? He probably knows that he would crash the market if he dumps everything. Why would he destroy his own creation?
You also don’t know exactly which coins belong to him. If he uses his 50 BTC from Blocks number 1000. How do you know it’s satoshi?
He probably wouldn’t use his BTC from block 1.
Which addresses would you freeze? Maybe the bitcoins from block 1000 belong to somebody else. Do you want to freeze his BTC as well?
And also look at the replies from others. Bitcoin is designed to be censorship resistant. I wouldn’t use it anymore if you can just exclude somebody.

That’s what I am doing  :)
If you want, I can open a channel to you. If you’re always online I can give you a 0.02 BTC channel. 
If you’re willing to share your public node address ;)
@_date: 2018-12-22 12:33:30
Perfect :)

Tell me your secret ���� (just joking)
Do you’re really make that much?
My node is only one month old but I already have 34 Channels, with quite a few inbound as well. My capacity is also not too bad. In that month I received 6 Satoshi. I’m not complaining because I know I have a quite young and still not very balanced node. But 5$ a month seems a lot

This is my long term vision.
Maybe in future you will have something like a credit card, but actually it’s just a a plastic card which holds your private keys. This card will be NFC enabled.
The merchant will create a Bitcoin invoice, you place your card on it and press a small button. Your signed translation ( not your private keys of course) will be sent to the merchant’s machine and he will send the signed transaction to the blockchain.
On this NFC card you could display a public key QR code to top up your wallet.
Obviously you wouldn’t want to have too much money on this card.

It’s a very cool thought. I would like the idea if this is a world record. I hope nobody will sell anything in Venezuela for 1 Bolivar. I might be even cheaper ��

Also make sure port 10009 is configured in your lnd.conf.
For example
to enable connection from anywhere.
