Since only the wealthiest, most powerful, can steal through inflation, among other methods, Bitcoin should lessen this a bit.  Otherwise it will get to the poor the way any money gets to the poor, only this one is digital in nature.  Doesn't mean that it can't be used on paper.  It doesn't require a cellular service to use, either.  Old/used devices with wifi could be used.  It's possible to use with a feature phone, too.
If something like an iPod with a solar back or case existed, the used ones would likely be perfect for many.
I don't want to confuse the digital nature with the benefits for everyone, including poor people, though.  They'll potentially be able to take payment in BTC, and immediately convert to gas, groceries, etc., for less.

@_date: 2015-06-19 16:28:48
That other one was a terrible attempt at an explanation.  Let me try again.
It's not wisdom, it's just perspective.
Inflation is an increase in the supply of the currency.
There are a total digital units that are supposed to be fixed.  The ability to move the decimal to the right of that total number of units doesn't change the value, but does inflate the total available amount in the currency.  It increases the supply of the digital currency by a factor of 10.
So it's not that 1 BTC is worth more or less than 1.0 BTC, or 1.000 BTC..
It's that 1 BTC = 100,000,000/2.1 quadrillion total today.
Making Satoshis divisible by 10 means
1 BTC = 1,000,000,000/21 quadrillion.
The value hasn't changed, but the total amount of digital currency has.
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:49:35
You should, unless you never cared about the fact that bitcoin would never be inflated beyond 2.1 quadrillion units.
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:34:31
I understand why that's not analogous.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:46:22
The 21m bitcoins, which are divisible by 100,000,000, was marketing.  "21m BTC.. &amp; change" is probably more appealing than 2.1 quadrillion units.  Not only that but pretending that a "bitcoin" is one unit means it looks like just one "Bitcoin" is worth $250..  which is likely more palatable then saying one unit of the currency is $.0000025, &amp; needing 8 million of them to buy a pizza.
I always felt that there was no reason for divisibility, but if you were going to have it for whatever reason, go to 100ths, which we're all familiar with.  Maybe 1,000ths.  Now that I see so many people are confused by it, it seems that it would be best to have no divisibility.

The Soviet Union was thought to have half the world's gold supply.  When it fell, it proved to have none.  Go back &amp; look at how the exchange rates changed when the rest of the world discovered there was half as much gold as was previously thought.
@_date: 2015-06-19 12:58:04
I just read something a few days ago which mentioned being able to further divide bitcoins.  Anything that results in changing the total number of units will be the end of bitcoin, as people will jump to whatever CC does offer the most reliable fixed amount.
Moving the decimal one place to the right, so that there's 210m BTC, but still the same total of units (2,100,000,000,000,000?) wouldn't be as bad, but why do it?  Any tampering with what was supposed to be a fixed characteristic will seriously undermine the faith in the people calling these shots in BTC.
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:52:51
If you guys don't understand that a currency going from 2,100,000,000,000,000 total units to 21,000,000,000,000,000 is inflating it tenfold, than bitcoin will be even easier to destroy than I feared.
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:38:38
1 BTC = 1 BTC certainly..
However, 1 BTC won't be worth as much if you increase the amount of digital units by a factor of 10.
It doesn't matter if there is 2.1 BTC divisible by a quadrillion, or 2.1 quadrillion BTCs which aren't divisible.  They represent 1/2,100,000,000,000,000 of the units on the blockchain, wherever we move the decimal.  The moment there are more than 2.1 quadrillion digital units on the bitcoin blockchain, we've just had inflation, &amp; anyone who is paying attention is going to recognize that as the final nail in the bitcoin coffin.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:52:07
Back pedaling from the point you can't understand?  Not in the slightest.  From my ability to explain it in a way you can grasp?  Absolutely.
One last try...
How many total units are there now (we currently call these smallest units "Satoshis")?
How many total units will there be if you can divide Satoshis by 10?
Eliminate the decimal, &amp; stop considering value, or exchange rate.  Has the amount of the supply of total units gone up?  If you followed, it should have increased by a factor of 10.  That is inflation.  That is what some of us chose this CC to avoid.
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:43:40
If there ever is more than 2,100,000,000,000,000 digital units of "Bitcoin", whatever they're called, Bitcoin will have been inflated beyond what we were originally promised, &amp; will have proven to be just another scam currency.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:06:14
Forget what you know about bitcoin &amp; consider what it is.
"There are only 21 million of this currency called bitcoin".
That statement, if true means that only 21 million people could hold this currency at once, which there are supply &amp; demand implications for.
Well, you can divide this currency by 100,000,000.  We are only talking about numbers here.  This isn't pieces of gold, or pizza, or anything else.  So describing this currency as being limited to 21 million is silly, and has lead is to this misunderstanding right now.  Anyway, how many units are there truly to this currency?  There are 2.1 quadrillion.
Legs pretend that number is 1000.  We can pretend it's 10, 50, 3,671..  It doesn't matter..  but for the sake of not discussing such a large number, lets say that a CC has 1,000 total units.  This means that a 1,001st person couldn't have one.  If we decide that having 1,000 units is too few, we could move the decimal one point to the right, or we could simply make them divisible by 10.  This means there are now 10,000 units.  10,000 units is probably a lot more useful than 1,000..  That aside, we've just inflated this CC by a factor of 10.
There are 2,100,000,000,000,000 units, each worth approx: $0.0000025.  You can slide the decimal to the left at the same time on both the total units, &amp; the exchange rate..  It doesn't matter.  When you add to the total units of the currency, it doesn't impact the exchange rate (though it should if people valued the fixed total of bitcoins), but it absolutely does increase/inflate the amount of units in the currency.
I'm sure I butchered that..  I can't keep track of it all on my phone.  I was trying to show a visual to show how the amount of CC units didn't change, regardless of what you call it.
I just realized how to describe this..  Lol
In non-CC world, there is no difference between 0, &amp; 0.0, 0.00, etc..  In CC world, that's the different between 9 potential units, 99, &amp; 999.  Focusing on those values, &amp; not the tool that a CC is, is where you guys are failing to see the inflation.
Edit- those numbers above were meant to be listed one above the other, depicting moving the decimal around, &amp; still having the same supply of currency, regardless of what the nicknames of each are.  It didn't come out very well.  Hopefully you all get the point.

It may be that it doesn't work as the miners certainly can't be excited about it, but assuming they were open about it, it doesn't seem like it's a scam in any way. I assumed when you said that at first that there was not enough protection forum a 51% attack with the wealth distribution over so few people. That would be the only "scam" I could imagine, but I've not heard anything like it.
Some of us don't really care about the initial distribution if the network is solid, &amp; offers unique services. I'm interested in what I hear about NXT, and if they holders will exchange some to me, and other people will take it, that's my main concern.

Once BTC is what it was meant to be, it won't matter what people say or think about it.

All BTC needs to succeed is to incorporate anonymity.  I'd say it already has succeeded, because it has, but it will be replaced if it doesn't adopt advancements that protect privacy.  Once that is accomplished, it won't matter what the discussions are.  It will meet a desperate need, and help people escape some level of oppression all over the world.  It doesn't matter what you, or I, think of that.  It will be the best currency available at that point, regardless of the political relevance for you or anyone else.

~~It's unfortunate that~~ it seems CC are now valued for keeping the old mining model alive, when hopefully the CCs of the future will eliminate the need for them.

It makes sense, but hopefully we'll figure out the CPU, or node, model &amp; we'll see less &amp; less of them.
Until then, people will mine BTCs while they can, not keep up with the new miners, and create a CC to continue mining.

Bitcoin is much too powerful a tool now that it's under control, and we don't even have to pay to maintain the network.
Also, since everyone knows that BTC is decentralized, &amp; supposedly no one is in control, we can use it to drop economic bombs on our adversaries, allowing people to flee with their money. As long as mine is still considered the reserve currency, BTC helps me by hurting my adversaries more than it can hurt me...  &amp; all this can be achieved with minimal tech, &amp; minimal agents, recruiting others within their borders, &amp; most importantly, this can be covertly with deniability.

At some point, though (mimblewimble?), there may be a sincere disagreement as to which way BTC should go.  I hope both sides make their case, give it some reasonable time, but then just go their own way.  Implement the best strategy, not a compromise.  Win the support of those like minded.

Please let me explain my point since it seems you have have inferred the opposite of my point..
The backers of each valued their favored coin more once forked than before.  In other words, the net value of Bitcoin didn't split into two brands, but actually increased on both sides.
The lack of compromise was more valuable to each perspective than it was before the split, but with out a unified direction.
My point truly is that I hope Bitcoin never compromises with "unBitcoin" strategy, &amp; does its thing regardless of what others choose to do with their copy of the blockchain.
For the record, I exchanged from BCash instantly to add more Bitcoin, in hopes that it would offset any value lost in the fork...  which didn't happen.  It went up in value.  Let that be a lesson to us all!

If sabotaging is an option, Bitcoin needs serious work.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:10:55
Wouldn't it, though?  The blocks aren't always full, &amp; having 75% capacity resolved in 75% of the time..  Maybe that would only slightly increase transactions under some circumstances, but it would result in it working faster, no?  Whatever the size blocks are typically when not full, I'd think there'd be some optimization by reducing the size/time evenly to meet that typical demand.
Also, it could be offset slightly, ie 5 min block, and 600k.  Or maybe leaving it at 1mb, but reducing to 9 min between blocks.
I assume whatever might be optimal would constantly be changing based on transaction volume, and network connectivity.  Optimization for the weakest links seems to be a good strategy to me.

What's the news with Zerocoin?  I'm holding out hope that the propagandists trying convince the BTC community  its unnecessary &amp; bad PR, lose any sway they may have had by the time Zerocoin protocol is available.
It's only going to become more obvious at how necessary privacy is as time goes by..  both because of how oppressive most states are (&amp; getting worse), but also because that's just such an obvious valuable need for the eventual successor to BTC.
The way establishment players work is, whatever they adopt &amp; control is what they want to force everyone to use, regardless of needs, or new innovation.  Hopefully the BTC community will reognize this influence, &amp; refuse to allow BTC to be the greatest surveillance tool ever made.
@_date: 2015-09-20 14:00:35
I think replacing Bitcoin is what we should hope for one day, &amp; that a "first mover advantage" isn't an advantage to us, specifically because *we can replace bitcoin someday*.  There is a much more important "final move advantage" that has to do with securing the characteristics of a cryptocurrency for people to rely on in perpetuity, &amp; as long as there isn't a final move, that window for corruption is never closed entirely (or at least, never closed as much as possible).
This whole discussion has made me conclude that we have a great need for many cryptocurrencies ongoingly.  Hopefully we'll have at least one that is the success bitcoin has been over the last few years which gets set in stone, &amp; then we won't have to worry about corrupting forces on other "ambitious" ones.
@_date: 2015-09-22 14:24:12
I just continued listening, &amp; he goes on to mention that there could be an interest in the "weaker" currency.  It's important to recognize that bitcoin is the weaker currency, but it's the one that comes with the options people needed.
Bitcoin is only the largest among the digital currencies which exist outside of the old realm of control, to a degree.
Edit..  So if, or unfortunately likely "when", bitcoin is corrupted, we'll look elsewhere to solve this issue.  I wouldn't be surprised if cryptocurrencies largely have shorter and shorter spans at the top, as the dominating forces succeed in corrupting each of them. So be it.  We just need to recognize this, &amp; adapt.
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:14:02
I find this very disconcerting.  Not only the fact that we're all using owned hardware, hoping our wealth isn't targeted, but the entire network we're dependent on is controlled as well.  Even OSHW uses corrupted chips, afaik.  We may not have a dependable OS, but if we do, 99.9% of the hardware is compromised.
As if that wasn't enough to totally manipulate a cryptocurrency, the states have coin coloring agencies known as exchanges, which could manipulate the exchange rate, like every other medium of exchange.
Even if there was a sovereign nation willing to adopt BTC as their legal tender, it would bring the wrath of established nations down on it, both above board, &amp; covertly.  There would be a regime change before long.
If it's not already too late, the bottom 90% of nations with no aspirations of being the world's reserve currency should throw their collective weight behind a cryptocurrency.  Begin their own chip, &amp; hardware, manufacturing, &amp; support distributed meshnet tech.  That's if they're not already just puppet states for the US, being tolerated as long as they comply.  If they still have a choice, they won't forever.  That choice isn't tolerable to those that would own them.  The fact that the option exists for them to take means that steps are being taken to eliminate it.
All that aside, we need to know that there are steps each of us can take to control our wealth.  If we can't, then Bitcoin isn't the worlds greatest surveillance tool, &amp; also a very efficient currency...  It's *just* a surveillance tool, &amp; a trap.

All this disengenuous BS...  all the non-principled care about is the wealth, otherwise they'd just create their own rather than try to coopt what has been built.  Bait and switch, just like Ethereum.  It drives me nuts that what Ethereum was advertised and sold as was forced to a new name, whereas the "switch" takes the brand, because again, all most people care about is the wealth.
BTC and whatever Bitcoin Unlimited would be should split.  Everyone would have essentially half interest in both.  They could keep it, or sell off one.  Basically pay your opposition to go away so we can get on with it.
Divergence is acceptable.  Perpetual gridlock isn't.  No more compromises.  Make your best, ideal, play, and people will come along or they won't.  No one gets to own Bitcoin, which I assume is the heart of this issue.
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:15:56
Yes, don't misunderstand...  I wouldn't recommend the tactics I mentioned to anyone who didn't have them not stealing your wealth and using it to enslave/kill people with as the first priority.  If you think you want to negotiate with the state, you're not going to protect your property from them.

Another perspective.. I'd support "Bitcoin Limited", or perhaps "Decentralize Bitcoin", if it reduced the blocksize so that more people/devices could contribute  to the network.
A free, non-fiat, currency, of any cost or exclusivity is essential.  A cheap one is a luxury (afforded by the former) that isn't nearly as important to me and those of like mind who are concerned about this singular opportunity for humanity.

In the short term, the control coin.  It will be invested in by those who would keep us controlled.  Look to original Ethereum vs the dictated &amp; centralized version, for example.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:06:25
It's going to happen anyway, but the "ROME WILL BURN" attitude would ensure  that it would happen if it wasn't...  which it is.
Here's what will happen..
Those who want to destroy/coop BTC will pump Controlcoin &amp;/or Establishmentcoin from 2 &amp; 3, to 1 &amp; 2.  Even if this wasn't their obvious tactic for a while, the window is here now.  They'll take it.
People who are only interested in profit will exchange to ETH taking part in the bribe.
What remains to be seen is how those of us left will handle this bit of markerting.  Will we rush to change, as if this is an authentic market action based on ETH, which is nothing (whatever it is, it's less valuable than ETC from a technical perspective), &amp; potentially alter bitcoin in some awful way?  Will we abandon it?  Those are the two desired outcomes by whoever is pushing this bit of marketing.
BTC has risen and dropped against many other stores of value in the past.  Did you hold then?  Did all they need to do is make it drop down the list of CCs to get you to throw in the towel?
I say the best thing BTC can do is keep on bitcoining.  This is an obvious plot to get us to destroy ourselves.
Let them go chase their returns.  Maybe that will leave us with a better signal to noise ratio.
Edit - If they don't succeed, they'll try to coop a POW coin down the list in their next attempt.  That way they can weaponize the actual infrastructure of the network against BTC's potentially vulnerable hashrate.
You didn't think they'd let us have permissionless, decentralized, currency, did you?
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:48:42
Or gift cards.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:25:53
ETH is a bribe to entice people away from bitcoin until Bitcoin is seen as yesterdays news, or the hashrate diminishes enough so that it can be corrupted.  Same tactic as Roger Ver.  Fortunately ETH is ether, and so there's no significant infrastructure to turn against a more vulnerable Bitcoin.  This is just marketing to convince people to do it for them... for now.
I suspect we are about out of time in this race.  We needed a good forum to discuss bitcoin, &amp; CCs, where propaganda could be mitigated, as opposed to being on reddit, which is a propaganda machine at this point.  Those of you out there who are sincerely interested in BTC should start looking for alternatives (or start scouring buried/removed content).
Good luck!
