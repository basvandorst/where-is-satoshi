I have a question about this video. How does one go about programming a segment of a bitcoin to be used for or represent a certain thing?
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:27:12
because they are password protected cards. bit-card.de uses 2 party to verify security. the addresses on the cards were generated by them to be unlock by the passcodes we made. I guess I made new addresses and didnt even realize it.

In reality their slogan is not a lie. You bought the Bitcoins in minutes. However, you did not receive them until much later. Extreme technicality yes, just wanted to point that out.

I THINK I understand basically how the blockchain works. A network of nodes reading a ledger of transactions and approving transactions if the numbers add up. Each approved transaction being logged in that ledger and shared across the network.

People starve to death every day in places where being homeless is a crime. People die because they can't afford insurance or the governments fine for not having it. People get killed and robbed because someone can't afford to feed their family and gets desperate. The american people are sheep. They will not act unless they can be convinced by those same talking heads who can speak on a level low enough for everyone to understand. We are the batshit crazy conspiracy theorists and its god damn time to do something about the monster we have allowed to fester in our once proud capitol city.

Coinbase has stopped trading. They reached their trading cap and have no more to sell. Get on LocalBitcoins. Find someone nearby who is willing to do a trade on site. Bring them to the presentation to show exactly how care free it is. Buy from them there and then buy something online with the coin you just purchased. That should be a good proof of concept. Also, offer the person a little extra for their time and as a thank you.
Edit: For the sending of payments, you could pay the person you're trading with for their time to show your employers how simple that is too.

If you are going to a place out in town, talk to them about Bitcoin, help them set up a wallet if they are interested. Then not only can you spend it there, but YOU helped them get started accepting it. As far as online places, try emailing them to do the same thing.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:23:18
Its not that they don't pay attention. They know whats going on. They are paid for by very wealthy people who don't want bitcoin around because its bad for their corruption. So they pay tools like this to report crap like this.
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:05:28

Ive been reading these comments. Its grand. However, no matter what a government does. The people will get their way in the end. America tried to outlaw alcohol. Americans wanted alcohol. People drank in hidden bars and made their own supplies. If the government were to ban ASICs but the people wanted ASICs. They would work in hidden factories to make them and distribute them like drugs. Crime would skyrocket, and the government would have one option. Repeal the ban. It matters little what the goverment says if it is not in line with what the governed want. People forget how much power they really have.

Bad things tend to happen to good people I'm afraid. But as long as you have not done anything wrong or with malicious intent. Any judge worth his weight in justice could not convict you of any crime. That is...if you are in America. Keep the faith and stay a good person.

The only major concern is if one person or organization is in control of more than 51% of the network. At that point they could implement new protocols without the consent of the community. Seeing as the hash rate is as high as it is. I don't think this is likely. However not impossible.

If you use that calculator I put in my last comment you can put the code on that coin in there and get the hex. I don't know how to turn that to Base 58, but some wallet service will take the hex code. Its worth a shot. I would LOVE to buy one off of you but I dont have $700 right now.

If I estimate high on the power then I know beyond any shadow that I'm not under estimating. Due to the fact that my apartment complex has a utility manager that charges a fee on top of that. I have no clue how much that fee is. My point is. If I estimate expenses high then the returns that are calculated are lower. So when the returns come out higher. I lost nothing and if for some reason they are the same. No disappointment.

I saw someone ask the question why would anyone sell a rig and that if he had 50 of them he would plug them in and use them himself. Why would you trust anyone who is selling something for less than what they could make off of it?

Basically what he is saying is if 100 people each have 2 Bitcoins in their accounts, as long as the owner of the bank draws a pentagram on the floor and chants "Ravioli Ravioli give me the Formuoli" Satan will be summoned from hell and will conjure up 100 "Ghost Coins" onto the network thus throwing off the perfect harmony of the miners and causing time itself to collapse.

@_date: 2013-11-22 18:17:44
That. Would. Suck. Not for us, just for him. As far as I have heard the original coins havent been moved in a while. So they have no effect on the market right now. But damn, I would have seriously bad thoughts if it were me in that situation.

One last question. What is your opinion of mining bonds or contracts. Paying someone else to do the work and getting paid back. Also seems kind of too good to be true
@_date: 2013-11-13 08:06:08
I would think that he card would be more communication instructions for the reader to your wallet. Having you wallet set up with whatever key you wish to have connected. Or have it set up to change on each swipe to prevent being tracked. And then later you can use your phone to ensure the wallet has funds and is the one that the card will ask for next.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:12:45

@_date: 2013-11-14 15:21:04
They are very similar in some aspects. A new idea that everyone is skeptical about at first. And then slowly it becomes a part of everyone's life and a household name. Albeit bitcoin does cost money it will most likely either get adopted the same way. Or slowly fade back into the bowels of the internet.
@_date: 2013-11-16 07:07:51

But if 49% of the network implements a protocol. The blocks mined until 51% is reached are rejected and the hash rate drops by 49% correct? Or am I missing something?

@_date: 2013-11-15 17:15:36
I'm sorry. I meant the current network hash rate is too low. It would probably be higher if Google were on board by at least 15%. And as the difficulty increased so would googles hash rate and then the networks would too.

@_date: 2013-11-26 21:37:59
I agree. Trust me, I spent my money on things my parents were NOT ok with.  However for something like Bitcoin, you either have to 1. have a bank account (need parental permission to get one) or B. Meet a strange person (alone if youre parents are not ok with bitcoin) Second one is dangerous for a younger person. First one not so hard but some parents monitor the activity.

You assume that once someone controls all of it that the idea is dead. People will still want it. Therefore, shops will continue to accept it so that they can get it back into the circulation. People will still buy it from you so that they can use it. It may not have a shiny physical form like gold does. But what bitcoin stands for IS its intrinsic value.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:03:52
False. If you but up every bitcoin. People will still want it. Therefore you control the price and can make it high or low. Same with gold.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:50:36

@_date: 2013-11-16 07:01:57
So if that's the case...what makes it so decentralized if a group of people can get together and change the protocol? That seems pretty.....central.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:54:11
It very well could. Those coins could be locked away forever. OR they may make it a challenge. "Calling all hackers, 10% of this wallet could be yours if you can open it" and then either arrest or hire the winner. (They would find something to arrest hem for)

You should never allow emotion to cloud your judgement. Research and market observation will go a long way. There was a lot of talk about a huge rise during the hearing. Then after the hearing there was talk of an impending correction. Both of those things happened. You just have to keep an eye on what is happening in the market AND in the world. There are a lot of things that affect the price.
@_date: 2013-10-26 18:12:25
Yes. But paper is generally the safest. 2 separate keys. One for depositing money. The other for "withdrawing" money. One is good the give out. The other...not so much.

Hmmm...never seen an issue like that. I would imagine one of 2 things. Either its going to completely disappear at midnight their time. Or the btc will post and you can pull it. Again probably at midnight their time.

So when they auction off a criminals car. It slcould be decked out and worth $20k. The auction might start at $5k. Same idea. They will value it much below its original worth.

Now I KNOW you have to pay a gains tax. That much has been clear in the U.S. but I am sure selling to your spouse for a loss and claiming it on your taxes would be considered tax fraud. Not only that but you wouldnt get back what you lost so it would be a waste of money.

Downvotes are supposed to be reserved for things that are irrelevent or people being dicks. The fact that people downvote everything because they are having a bad day or just want to be assholes pisses me off. So our comments follow the same ideal. People being dicks. It ruins the world. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:08:44
You have to have a bank account to buy Bitcoin. After that if someone connects your bank account to you wallet, they can follow your transactions. There is no way to hide it. I am not saying it can't be done, but its not just as cut and dry as buy bitcoin and move it around and sell it. 
Edit: You have to have a bank account to buy from an exchange. You can buy in cash using Local Bitcoins. If you are moving a lot of money though, unless you pay large amounts to the guy selling you bitcoin, a trader probably isn't going to have enough to launder a brifcase full of cash.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:19:36
I do. I only own .15 btc. But I spend small amounts here and there to spread the word. I'm not in this for profit right now. I'm in this to decentralize money.

So the smartphone would serve only as a a storage device like a thumb drive because I don't have a free one right now.

Right, but the only difference between priceless and worthless is in the eyes of the consumer. A persian rug that is priceless to you could be worthless to me. I agree now that Bitcoin would most likely fail if someone bought it all, but there would still be believers.

I wish it would let me sign in at work but I can get to my phone to get the confirm code to login here. As long as you have a wallet there should be an import/export link on the left side. I know for a fact that the app has one. If you can find it set up a blockchain wallet too. They have that feature and its right up front and easy to find.

When I check out someplace I don't speak to the cashier. Like at all. I swipe my card an walk away. Not out of disrespect. I'm just really introverted. I would love to promote Bitcoin but its hard to do because I'm not good at even talking to people. The short little descriptions you put up make it easier because I'm not on the spot trying to describe it to someone I'm uncomfortable with. It also keeps the talk time down so I'm not as uncomfortable for as long. I'm working on it and this might help with that too.

If there is a market for it I'm sure someone would be willing to shell out to cover it up and run the machinery. Anything can be hidden and anyone can be bought. For the right prices. This is only my opinion I'm not basing this paragraph on any evidence because frankly I'm too lazy to look. This does make logical sense to me. Think of all the illegal things that happen just because someone has money to hide it.

@_date: 2013-11-19 19:19:49
I get that but they are using all of coinbases copyrights on the site just plastered there. That also would constitute copyright infringement.
@_date: 2013-10-20 17:38:52
That actually makes a lot of sense. Thank you. I am stuck on what looks like there can only be 21 million bitcoins? Is this due to the fact that there simply aren't enough combinations of numbers to make more? Or is this an artificial market cap?

I'm considering it. Everyone is saying don't mine. I'm not extremely knowledgeable in this area but I've done some calculations and the numbers always seem too good to be true. Probably not using the right difficulty increase rate. and by keep positive I meant paying for the rig and the power in a month or 2 and then profiting for a couple months to buy expansions and keep going.
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:05:45
I get what you're saying. And I agree they aren't really a problem per se.  But if you want to also try to get someone to stop smoking there has to be some sort of system to prove that they didn't. Have a friend or loved one that wants them to quit verify? That way I'd they just want to take bitcoin. Whatever, let them. But if they genuinely want to quit. They have that opportunity as well.

Is this one of this accounts that someone mass created just going around pretending to be them?
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:35:21
So you're using this account to hold drug money? Or youre protecting your money from being confiscated because it was in the same place as drug money? Either way you can just tell them you're making an account for a trip to Vegas. To keep this money separate from your important money that you can't gamble away.

Litecoin says that it is the "Silver to Bitcoin Gold." Does it have the potential to take off?
@_date: 2013-09-16 08:42:27
So what hash/sec rate will keep me future proof for at least 6 months?
@_date: 2013-09-30 15:14:45
Sorry I misunderstood. You are buying from a person not a company. The companies are running rigs. Your person probably isn't now. But 60ghs is very low for this difficulty. You would need triple digits to profit.
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:54:21
Where do you see that?
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:44:23
That's just bad business. A dentist should hand out extra cans to keep the kids coming in.
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:55:24
I think someone is trying to cause a panic sell
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:45:40
Robin hood!!
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:30:56
Thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:13:14
Because the pizza websites don't accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:47:47
Could these be the orignal coins? How does one find out??
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:59:27
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:57:31
I thought you were legitimately asking questions
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:14:35
The FBI could always have them in a room while they "interrogate" the password out of DPR.

Well I have seen him around this sub several times and he seems like a pretty genuine individual. I wouldn't believe just anyone saying that. I wsa also unaware of the meaning of "/s"
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:47:51
But I think what OP is trying to say is that there will be less need for atms once bitcoin gets a lot more popular 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:21:08
Sorry I did mean confirmations. Is there a way to get a rig to look for transactions specifically to one or a groud of wallets?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:35:50
Have you met future me?
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:01:44
How secure?
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:30:01
But to get back to your original question no. However the idea intrigues me and I would love to try it if someone could get one on the market. Or work with someone to get one on the market...hint hint to anyone who has time for a project that could be easily crowd funded!

Printed money is usually destroyed. All other assets are usually auctioned off. You can go to a police auction and buy all kinds of stuff for cheap. The feds do it the same way.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:39:37
Time. If you buy from bitstamp its generally not immediate. Coin base still isn't for me for some reason. And then I've heard Mt box is a nightmare for buying or selling. Its all about how long it takes to cash in and out.
@_date: 2013-09-26 03:58:53
I believe you are thinking of nougaty
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:52:23
Sorry I wasn't saying they were long. I meant that so much awesome stuff was happening in those seconds that considering them "mere" was quite an understatement. I meant it as a joke.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:42:36
If you're worried about losing a lot of money. Don't buy a whole one yet. But a fraction of one and get your feet wet. Only what you are willing to lose

Its currently evidence to the justice system. It will he returned to the market once everything is said and done.

Where would I find these stocks and bonds?
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:39:19
Awesome. Thanks! Like I said though you If you have 100 BTC and the price plummets. You arent going to get all of that money back. Just a percentage. So really holding on is the best option.
@_date: 2013-10-07 01:52:58
I'm sorry I don't know everything. Why don't you go fuck yourself instead of being a condescending low life?
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:42:38
Are you being serious? Or is this a joke?
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:50:51
You can't control it. Just relax and let the roller coaster go where it will *cough* to the moon *cough*. Sleep. Don't kill yourself over this or you won't be able to spend all your glorious profit.
@_date: 2013-09-15 07:55:25
Is that why people are selling miners?

Part of me wants you to be serious. But I would want to talk more before I moved to your 100 acre plot...you know...just in case you're a murderer or something 
@_date: 2013-09-16 08:22:37
Would also like to know. Commenting so I can check in the am.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:57:31
Well this is the first time I've ever said it. And probably only because its about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:45:21
It wouldn't be. But it also wouldn't be $2.75 just to take out $20
@_date: 2013-09-27 04:33:16
Our product isn't on the market yet. Its still in early dev. We need money. 6K for a 2ths rig seems like a good idea to bring in capital.
@_date: 2013-09-16 09:32:44
Is there a good source for seeing what its currently worth and a ticker of events that may change its value? Like a bit coin news source?
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:19:15
Localbitcoins is my go to. You will be surprised how many people in your area do it.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:31:00
I have never been complemented on my patience. Never said I was giving up. Just asking about any events in the market.
@_date: 2013-11-16 04:19:42
So how does the word get out if someone wants to implement new protocol? The way you explain it if they are the only one to implement it, their blocks are discarded. How would you get a majority update?

Silent coin might be better. Takes away zeros bad stigma and gives it a touch of mystery

Astronomical heights? Such as...the moon?
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:57:54
I guess I did miss that. I'm on Hawaii time so that probably happened while I was working
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:01:29
Person to person. Meet up and transfer.
Edit: Depending on where you live I can put you in touch with the person I trade with. Big name on the west coast and hawaii. Huge transactions and lots of good reviews.

Can't wait for the album!

Hash rate is too low. If Google were mining. They wouldn't be using petty amounts of power. They would be in pretty substantially
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:10:25
Looking down at...boobs? Haha jk. Thats creative!
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:34:05
Only a dollar or two above average for out here. Everything is expensive in Hawaii.

This...could be profitable....
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:29:34
Well right now its tight for me. I will be buting a small amount but I really wish I was getting more for that $50.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:45:08
I understand that. However, I have seen subreddits (for example. That when a post is made you are supposed to add flair to it and it is placed in a separate category with its own tab at the top. Everyone can post in the same place, but its much more organized and you can find what youre looking for.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:33:10
Your caution is well warranted. However, for some reason I have faith that they will do the right thing for once. Is that faith misplaced? Perhaps. We shall see.

Interesting. Is it just in limbo? A pending transaction? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:59:20
What exactly do you need? To be able to make transactions? Or something specifically from Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:08:13
Most of Bitcoins value is in the idea of how it works and that someday it can replace the current systems. Tha combined with the limited number that will ever exist makes them valuable. The fact that merchants accept them as payment for goods and services makes them that much more valuable. Supply and demand. The supply has been capped. More people get involved and wat them. The supply will NOT go up. The demand will.

When you say physical coins you mean the ones that have the wallet keys on the back under a sticker? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:33:43
You could always bring your parents here. I am in they U S Navy and I use Bitcoin. Ask them to read some articles. Put together a presentation for them with some news bits from the Senate hearings. Whatever you do, don't get frustrated and don't TELL them they are wrong. Show them.
Also, my parents and devout Christians. I am guessing one of the points you are facing is the one world government in the book of revelations. Well look around this reddit. Do these seem like the type of people who would stand for ANY government? Much less a one world one. I convinced my father of this fact and he is now VERY interested in the idea.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:51:17
They do keep 90% of your coins I'm cold storage. They may be having a huge influx of people pulling them out and they may be having trouble keeping up with the demand. Hey keep them in cold storage for security. I'm not sure why they would be taking so long to get back to you other than too many people having issues.
@_date: 2013-09-17 07:08:49
Wrong sub. Jobs for bit coins is what you're looking for
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:47:44
I was surprised when I looked too. There are a lot more people involved than I originally thought
@_date: 2013-09-22 20:12:45
So the difficulty and the increase rate seem accurate?
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:10:03
I can't be sure. If you just opened the site probably not. But I would run a scan to be safe because I'm paranoid. And don't buy anything from them. If they aren't malware. They're phishing.

How much do you pay for couples?
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:20:35
So when I go to that website it forwards to buybitcoin.com which is nothing but a URL to coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:17:33
It's never too much to ask, but sometimes (unless you can afford to pay one person for nothing but it) it can be very difficult to do when working to get something up, running, and open.

Wallet "recovery services" 
Edit: Not 100% sure what they do...but it seems like just that.
