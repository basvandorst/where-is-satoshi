Bought 5 dollars worth of bitcoin a few hours ago. Let’s see where I get
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:08:26
Probably because b2x fork was cancelled

I would direct you to create a support ticket, but their support is relatively poor. 
I would suggest using their mobile app to send your coins. Normally works without id. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:20:34
Really? I did it before the bitcoin gold fork. What did they ask you for? Have you done any gambling, etc with your coins? 
There are reasons for it, but I have freely moved my coins without ever needing to release my identity.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:39:49
Hate to tell ya but the limit is 280 now
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:01:33
But we do know that it’s ether that they r after...
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:22:10
But do you have free bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:47:27
Fork incoming
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:25:26
You should be able to build a time machine with the bitcoin tho... instead of too the moon make it too the past lol

There are laws and stuff preventing this sort of thing from coming to the us right? Or are you fucking with us �� 
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:39:42
No us app?
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:23:32
Well there is [spankcoin](
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:22:43
Get a wallet, preferably hardware, and then make sure u have your private keys etc in check and send your coins. Also be sure to try with a small amount first
