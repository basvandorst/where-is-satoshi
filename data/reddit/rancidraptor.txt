TOR didn't make bitcoin anymore anonymous in the first place. Your browsing habits became pseudo-anonymous, but transactions did not. The blockchain is a public ledger.
Tor merely gave you the option to find places to spend your coins on things that the powers that be deem to be illicit. By using TOR, you open yourself up to having your traffic sniffed in another capacity as opposed to normal browsing.  Yes with TOR the traffic is encrypted between hops, but at compromised end-nodes, it's a fucking funnel.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:26:25
Correct, they generally don't. There is a chance that some of them retain cards from before they were on the street, and some *might* have cards from periods where they were shacked up in a DTES rathole. Over-all, the odds they have access to internet is gonna be limited to a few things like free wifi at coffee shops which require your own device.

@_date: 2014-11-08 23:20:51
It only really provides privacy in the right circumstances. 
If you deal with a compromised individual, for example one of the TOR marketplaces that have been raided recently, your transaction was probably recorded (by LEA) and your wallet will most likely be noted. In the case of a TOR transaction, they'll probably keep the record and try to match you to the wallet to strengthen a case against you.
If you make a more 'private' deal with someone, whether buying or selling coins, or something else that's taking place through private correspondence (not on a server that is or can be compromised like a dark market) you have considerable more 'privacy'.
Overall though, I'd use the term 'privacy' lightly, as just about anything done online these days has a high risk of being 'observed' and recorded.
@_date: 2014-11-09 08:23:25
Inputting of the private key might be a little tough though. Currently, with debit cards and such, the keypad has raised marks to help input a pin. When you add in a long mixed case alpha-numeric key, it becomes much more challenging.

Not at all. In fact I didn't even bother addressing that part, no point to it.
What I am doing however, is something called "Feeding the troll". The reason? You are just too good of a silly target to pass up. You won't (or can't) type in coherent sentences, won't ( or can't) use a spellchecker, and seem to be fixated on pedophiles. You are also a self admitted thief of bitcoins, and you seem to think that scams are good for the community and bitcoin as a whole. Scams prevent people from getting into bitcoin. It makes them wary, and destroys the trust that many bitcoin users are working very hard to build and promote. It's self defeating, and dishonest.

In a bizare way, I can find a comparison to the "value" of bitcoin with militaria items that I collected about twenty years ago. I would buy lots for a song and dance, so cheap. As time went by, more people got interested, and the value went up. Generation change caused the value to dip, and then it rose again. It got to the point where a 1941 US M1 that I had bought for 1.25 netted me 400 when I sold it to another collector.
Bitcoin, is on it's maturing journey, attracting first one generation, and then the next, and the price is working it's way along trying to find a "normalization" point.
I'm going to be honest, I don't care how many big ups and downs it goes through, I'm waiting patiently for the market maturity and the stabilizing point. I feel bad for those who bought in and lost, but it's going to continue to be par for the course until maturity is reached.
The point where we don't see eye to eye, is that I don't think bitcoin really needs to go up in price to be usable as a currency, apart from the shortcomings of it's ceiling, where you have  users and only  coins. But even with a higher price and a higher ceiling, you'll still have the same issues.

Do you remember the old practice the US Military had in occupied zones of paying the soldiers in [scrip]( In Vietnam they were issued scrip (which would change over a period of time to prevent accumulation) and actual US Currency was forbidden. One of the purposed was to prevent legitimate currency from working it's way into the black market.
So imagine Bitcoin in the same situation you mentioned, but the GBTCN's being treated the same way as scrip, with the same restriction, and useless for all but localized transactions, IF you can find someone willing to take them.

I knew I wasn't the only one left with some PowerPC rigs! Although mine still run the stock OSes from when I first got them (7.5 x 3, and 9.2.1). I tried tossing Mint PPC on the iBook (9.2.1) a while back but it wouldn't take, so I reverted. I still have some Debian 6.0.4 PPC discs as well, but I don't think I ever got it fully setup. The other 3 aren't worth altering much. ( LC, LC II, and a IIsi)
How are you liking the Pi? I have the images for Kali for it, but haven't gotten around to building a pi rig as of yet.
I run a mixture of Mint, Kali, Ubuntu Server, Fedora and I'm pretty sure I have drives floating around still with older version of Red Hat, Debian, Arch, and I think Gentoo. (I've sampled many others, but alot didn't make the cut past a day after install.) Then I have Mac OS's 7.5, 9.2.1, and OSX. And to cap it off still have windows boxes.

Dorian was being shitpiled by the media, Craig brought it on himself.

If that was the case you're undoing his work.
Just let it die man, let it all go.

Up until I switched fields a couple of years ago, the companies I was under contract with all still maintained their own intranets. Unless something drastic happened since then I would assume they still do.
The transaction speed of the current blockchain isn't enough for what they (the banks, Visa, etc) want to do with it, nor is the entirely open nature desirable. I don't think it would be "better", because the existing blockchain won't do what they want.
Whether it (Chain) will work, or last, is still to be seen.

It's actually related to the ads being served up. Drive-by-downloads from the adserver.

That made me laugh so hard my cheeks hurt.

Fiat rather than 'coin' is the plan anyways, all on their end.
It's not bitcoin related news, it's blockchain related news.

That is kind of what happens when a *"hero"* doesn't live up the hype and expectation. 
Could the **man** ever be as great as the **legend**, whoever he really is?
Probably not. But I'm ok with that. Are you?

I think you should read up on the broad use of the UK's anti-terrorism legislation. It's, hilariously terrible. While they may not be gunning for Wright, they do arrest people for some mundane stuff.

I would go with a crypto-related website/forum breach.
Does twitter keep your e-mail in the clear? That doesn't seem like a very good system. (I don't use twitter, so I have no idea how they handle their security)

It will *distract* you from the halving won't it.

It's all obfuscated code, so there is very little I can pick out.
I do know it's using the windows script host shell when it executes, and I know that it connects to a US based server to download it's payload.
Never run an unverified script or executable. Be on your toes.

Should probably sticky one of the more informative ones, or create a new sticky warning about it.
@_date: 2016-05-19 23:44:21
Yes, you do need to stop doing that. 
At this stage you don't know what running it has done either.

Well said, except you are overlooking the fact that the banks don't want to implement a variant of the blockchain for users, they want it for inhouse, interbank transactions. They've been working on a speeding it up and scaling it.

I told myself I would 6 hours ago. Then 4 hours ago I hit a point of "numb functioning" where I couldn't sleep. I think I'm just waiting now for the point where I blink for longer than normal and then slump over.

To see if it's legit, and to see where it originated from.
Looks like the e-mail came through Amazon's hosting services.  
The website where the .js script downloads it's payload from is hosted in the states, 'midphase hosting'.
I'm in a chat session with the hosting company now, they want me to send in an abuse e-mail over it.
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:58:20
don't run it.

It downloads a payload from a US based server. "dma_lockoader_Crypt.exe"
@_date: 2016-05-20 01:47:35
Yes, absolutely correct. My lack of sleep has been catching up to me for a couple of hours, and it's really showing now.

The banking sector hates liability.
The blockchain isn't bitcoin, and it can be adapted to suit their needs. Bitcoin doesn't suit their needs.

The .js file downloads a malicious payload. **DO NOT RUN IT**

If Satoshi was revealed to be Trump, Clinton, Gates, or some morbidly obese klucker it would be perfectly acceptable to continue to rate them less than 100/100.
It doesn't really matter who Satoshi really is anyways, it's the achievements done with what he started that's important.
I get what you are saying though.
I'm a little curious though as to what you'd rate Dorian Nakamoto, regardless of if he was Satoshi or not.
