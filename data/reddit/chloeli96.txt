How would it differ from the fiat they currently print?

Then a black market would emerge. I thought the whole point of crypto was to move away from the centralised nature of government controlled fiat?

Not entirely sure if there will be a panic sale out of ETH but certainly alts. And definitely would like to see the clamp down on ICO frauds. Hopefully this extends worldwide.

Does that mean my virtual overwatch bae doesn't exist as well? Noooooooo :P

This might not bode well for the crypto market in the short term, but could possibly solidify the authenticity and value of ICOs coming to the market in the long term.

It's near impossible to time the market. Just remember the age old adage, time in the market is always better than timing the market.

BTC just went 1900 to where it is now in 2 months.

An alternative hedge, maybe. But the new gold? Not so sure about that. Gold is an actual commodity that doesn't go through drastic price swings like BTC. How do you hedge a portfolio with an asset that has no price stability? 
Then again, I don't think that's going to stop people from buying into BTC or any other crypto currency for that matter. There are many people getting in now with the hope of making quick money. I'm personally in for the long haul. I  value the decentralised nature of crypto and the fact that, if this succeeds, it takes away all the power from the government and central banks. Can't wait for the day that happens.
