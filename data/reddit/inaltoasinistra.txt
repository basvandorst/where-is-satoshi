This is not an answer. You are saying that a website it is not a good investment because exists only hundreds of internet connections all over the world, and if tomorrow 1 billion people decide to get online the Internet will die.

I did a lot of deposits that day, on several accounts. After a while I was making the operations in a mechanically way.
In almost all accounts there was not any coin, so I filtered every time on BCH, but in the last account there were some bitcoins, so only BTC was shown. Since all the times before I sent coins when one currency is shown I skipped the filtering and I sent BCH to the BTC address

Can this project improves our experience with centralized exchanges?  
Exchanges needs liquidity to work well, so frammentate the market doesn't seen a good idea.  
If TxBit exchanges could work as a huge federated exchange it can work. In this case is necessary to decide how much users and administrators trust each other (in terms of $/€/฿). This could be provided by Ripple protocol, if I'm not wrong.
Ok, this could bring innovation.

Regarding proof-to-miner flaw: as you [describe]( it's possible for the miners to get free trust. But it's possible modify this type of proof, giving money up to N miners.  
The user sends a 0 output transaction with proof_money / N fee. The user waits N-2 blocks. Then s/he sends another transaction with N-2 outputs of proof_money / N, one for each miner that discovered a block; this second transaction has a proof_money / N fee.  
Both transactions will have the GUID recorded.
In this way a miner must mine N-1 blocks in a row to get trust for free.
It's possible increase N in order to increase security, paying more overhead into the blockchain.

Is also possible to introduce Scrypt in Bitcoin: the client could accept both sha256 and scrypt blocks. Difficulty are separatly computed, in the beginning the scypt difficulty will be artificially high using a function difficulty(time) = max(decreasing_function(time), real_difficult_function(x,y,z) ).
With this system would be possible has 50% sha256 blocks and 50% scrypt, rescaling difficulties is possible to achieve different percentages.
Edit: imo is important to modify Bitcoin instead of having more currency with the same function

You develope it 1 time into a library, than every software that use that library has it for free (if you don't use custom software for create transactions). Since it involves only the binary format of the transactions the upgrade is frictionless for 99% of the softwares.
Developers add everyday features to their libraries even if there is not a direct economic incentive to do that, they will do also this time.
Moreover, the advantages of SegWit go beyond the block size... solve malleability problem is sufficient to implement this.
EDIT: spell check

All full nodes see SegWit transactions as "anyone can spend", so they do not validate them but accept them if they are into blocks.
At the wallet layer SegWit introduce a new type of address "p...", since they are not supported by the old wallets developers also add a new type of P2SH transaction (addresses "3...") that use SegWit internally. In this way the address has a known format and also legacy software can fund a SegWit tx.

It is simply not possible that no one moves to the new version. Since there are not disadvantages in the upgrading, no one have a reason (except laziness) to avoid the new version.
So why do you look for an answer to this?

@_date: 2016-01-04 20:43:09
LOL. I mean, if Bitcoin can be used only as store of value IMO it can't compete with gold... Gold is been used for 600 year with this purpose, and it is shiny. Bitcoin has pratical advantages but I don't think that they are enough to throw away 600 years of trust. Moreover Bitcoin is more fragile than gold because it needs Internet to work.
On the other hand if Bitcoin has value for other purposes it will be great also as store of value. The other purposes are important for this first phase (50 years?)
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:25:50
I think that it is difficult that all the world will accept Bitcoin as store of value if it is not useful for other things. This scenario is too similar to the tulips one. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 07:32:58
Mmh, Bitcoin is dead again, what a pity ;) I think that you don't know how blockchain works if you think that banks are copying the best part of the technology
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:57:16
It's a good idea. Miners have to be updated and they check SegWit transactions. A legacy node must wait for one or more confirmations

Segwit will enable a simpler block size increase; OP codes to support Lightning Network; RBF enables exchanges and other big entities to use less blockchain space for withdrawals; Schnorr signature will provide smaller transactions; MAST will permit to have huge and complex scripts that use a very small blockchain space.

It is more like [this](
@_date: 2016-06-05 11:51:05
Printed QR codes are static, QR codes on screen could change every second.
The 2 way with QR codes is implemented using network. The QR code includes a https link and the wallet exchange data in both direction with a server.
Btw I think that the 2 way connection without an Internet connection on the device can be useful (for travellers, or in some places where mobile connection does not work)
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:00:47


Segwit does not reduce propagation time
@_date: 2016-06-13 08:02:10


Not they, someone. It is a separate layer
@_date: 2016-06-21 11:57:50
Yep, 128 is the safes answer. It is used for seeds of wallets.  
On the other hand, it is most difficult to attack a BIP38 encryped wallet:
* you need the encrypted key, you can't do an attack like the "brain wallet mining";
* scrypt slow down the attack. (Is scrypt used also in BIP39?)
Since this facts, it is safe to use less than 128 bit for a password?

The complexity of the algorithm to verify transactions is O( n^2 ), n=number of inputs of the transaction. So if 1MB transaction require 10" to get verified a 2MB transaction could take 10'


@_date: 2016-06-29 15:27:27
I was not clear, sorry.  
I mean that now, with Segwit, is it possible to increase the blocksize limit only changing one value; without Segwit it is not possible, because otherwise it would be possible create a single transaction of 2MB that will DoS the network. See: **Linear scaling of sighash operations** @ [segwit-benefits](

Really? 4 billions of rows in every routing table? Moreover IPv4 space is not enough already.

* the metadata automatically encrypted and loaded on cloud.

This does not affect consensus

@_date: 2016-12-08 13:23:44
Even with this facts routers does not know the location of every ip in the world, same is for txs in Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:17:14


But since there would be only 1 signature per block this is not important
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:16:27
Why is this important? The Segwit adoption makes only the blocksize bigger
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:11:18
Code that does not affect consensus could be modified. Remove signatures from txs and keep only one per block worth the work. Or is there an issue that I'm missing with caching?
@_date: 2016-11-29 08:49:31
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:12:48

I don't think that the network effect it is necessary to have a benefit from SegWit. If a wallet supports this you can pay less fees than all the other wallets (moreover there is the malleability fix)
@_date: 2016-12-10 08:50:35
I think because you manually manage private keys
@_date: 2016-11-27 08:18:41
The point 3 it is not possible with the current wallets

The user does not set the derivation path, the wallet deterministically choose a different path for each service. It's very easy: the user read the qrcode and confirm the login. Finish.
Also for that wallet developer it is easy to implement, the protocol claerly defines simple rules easy to implement
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:34:43


But other users do it. So your data (e.g. an email) could be exposed even if you does not have bad habits.
The users cannot be educated, they will be always lazy and ignorant.


Bitid doesn't use a blockchain.


If you are lazy you can use the password system in a bad way and you can create damage. With Bitid you are forced to have a good behaviour. The unique way to remove bad behaviours is doing that at protocol layer.
Actually a bitid app is simpler for users if compared to a password manager: regular and safe backups, synchronization amoung multiple devices... With bitid you must create one backup when you setup the system, thats all.

This is the payment request that the BIP70 server send to the client. Where is the required fee? If there is a value on the DeBitpay app it is computed from them (or it is not the fee that the wallet must choice, it is another fee).

This is wrong:
* BIP70 does not permit the merchant to choose/validate the fee of the customer; it can only reject it after the wallet had broadcasted, and this is possible also w/o BIB70;
* it is not needed BIP70 to manage the address and the amount, BIP21 is enough

Bitcoin remove power from the State. I call it libertarianism.
