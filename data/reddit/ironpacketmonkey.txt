Ah, well, if you had asked that in the first place I wouldn't have been as much of an ass.
  
  
I check  before sending a transaction, and manually set the fee. You can zoom in by clicking the fee ranges to the left of the graphs and the time range at the top.
  
  
For example: As of this reply, a tx with a fee of 400-450 sat/B is likely to be included in the next few blocks, while 300-350 sat/B is likely to take 10+ hours to confirm. A fee of less than 120 sat/B would likely remain unconfirmed till the weekend.

Each full node independently validates the entire blockchain, beginning with the Genesis Block, when it is first run. This is what makes a "fully validating" node trustworthy. And the point of running your own node is that you don't have to trust any other nodes. You'll just have to let it run for as long as it takes.

If the police did nothing, and it turned out the call was legitimate, the brass at the responsible agency would be *crucified*. On the other hand, if such a call was a prank and an innocent person gets harmed, the justice department tends to be *extremely* lenient towards police officers.

Realistically, banks will still be around, and provide the same services, well off into the distant future. Instead of completely replacing these functions, it's more likely that banks will use blockchain technologies to carry out these functions in a quicker, more efficient way.
  
As for loans, from what I understand, smart contracts would replace the "conditions" of a loan (i.e. the bank gives you $x, you pay back $x+interest by a certain date). High value contracts may still be backed up with paper.

Fair point and valid concern! As Mr. Antonopoulos puts it: "We are not Early Adopters or even Innovators, we are the Lunatic Fringe." 
  
I would tell newcomers to get informed; arm themselves with knowledge, and armor themselves with logic. I would encourage newcomers to learn as much as is practical, depending on their level of involvement, about the protocol, history and politics of Bitcoin, then make their own assessment. 
  
Afterwards, then we could have a discussion on the best ways to improve Bitcoin.

Who are the Holders though? There's overlap between the groups that make up Bitcoin. Miners can be Holders, and so can the folks who run exchanges. I maintain that the wider market will decide the surviving chain. Certainly the Holders holding the most will have a greater say.

This is not an unpopular opinion at all. I'm 90% sure that most of the Core developers are not against blocksize increases, just against rushed and untested changes that could have serious unintended effects. Blocksize increases were always part of the scaling road map, just not yet.

It depends on where the coins are transfered. Foreign exchanges, bitcoin mixing sites, and gambling website are a few examples that are definitely reported.

Layer2 solutions like Lightning Network, smart contracts, payment channels, and atomic swaps all work on top of blockchain protocols like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins based on them. This means that EVERY coin-chain could each support this theoretical maximum. As far as I understand, anyhow.

Probably because they've built their careers (and personal wealth) promoting traditional banking and investing, and have a vested interest in continuing to do so.
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:10:51
I don't think so. As I understand, miners each use their own independently developed software to decide and control which chain they will commit their hash power to, which transactions to include in a block, and then to construct a block header that's valid on the chosen chain. I don't think there's any formal coordination, either programmatically or business-wise, between pools.
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:47:50
This is the bit you seem to be missing:
  
New blocks are linked to the previous block in the chain by including the "previous block hash" in the header of a new candidate block. This is the technical "vote" mechanism behind the Proof-of-Work concept. New blocks mined on one fork of the chain will not be valid on the other. In other words, the two forks won't spontaneously reconverge.
  
Edit: NVM, I misunderstood your question.

If it's being used as a wallet, then transactions sent from that wallet will be broadcasted directly to the Bitcoin P2P network. If it's only being used to validate transactions and blocks, then it really doesn't add anything. You really only need one full node per public IP address / location. We are assuming that OPs first full node is in the same home on the same public IP address.

Not really, there are plenty of other exchanges. Gemini has been mentioned a few times, and I'll give them my endorsement as well. Twice the limits and half the fees of Coinbase. Localbitcoins is a good way too, you'll pay a little more for the anonymity though.

Full nodes independently validate the entire blockchain, beginning with the Genesis Block, when they first come online. This is what makes each full node an authoritative validator of all new transactions and blocks. The best practice is to be patient, and let the software sync as it was designed.

This is really clever, and a huge initiative toward settling market uncertainty ahead of a disruptive hard-fork. How were the CSTs initially distributed though? Evenly among all accounts, or relative to the balance by account? If a few other exchanges could implement something similar, we could have an even more accurate prediction in time for block 494784. Maybe even determine a winner before hand and avoid a contentious hard-fork altogether (one way or the other). 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:18:41
I would say that the general consensus among the community is that the transaction limit is mostly enough for now, but we acknowledge that it's a barrier to wide-spread adoption. We will need both on and off-chain scaling. On-chain scaling with blocksize increases, and off-chain with Layer2 networks like Lightning Network. The merits of these problems and possible solutions have been discussed at length, with widely varying viewpoints. I would suggest using the Reddit search function to find these discussions, or Google for more journalistic articles.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:34:43
Exchanges are a part of the market, but that's not what I meant. With a hard fork this contentious, I think there is bound to be at least one mining pool and one exchange betting against the 94.4% of miners signaling NYA, or will be betting that not all of them will be going all-in on the new chain. And of the exchanges who haven't taken a public stance, I think many will accommodate both chains. In summary, there is too much capital at stake for every individual or group to gamble 100% each in favor of one chain over the other. 
  
I've given this a fair bit of thought, you see. If you disagree with someone, please don't accuse them of being naive. If you must retort, present your own thoughts and the reasoning behind them. Thank you.

The price of a hardware wallet is the price of extra security. Whether it's worth it or not is up to the investor. For extra security on a budget you could use a 2-of-2 mulit-sig desktop and mobile wallet combo.

A full node is the P2P part of the Bitcoin network. Full nodes independently validate the entire blockchain, beginning with the Genesis Block. This is what makes each full node an authoritative validator of all new transactions and blocks. Once a new transaction or block is validated, the node will relay it to it's connected peers.

3.	Verify that your Bitcoin has actually been sent (at least six confirmations on the blockchain).
4.	Download trusted software that supports the new fork.
5.	Generate a new wallet using the new software, and save it offline.
6.	Import your old wallet keys into this new software wallet, and send all the Bitcoin to your newly generated offline wallet.
7.	Verify that your new currency has made it to the new wallet.

What's most likely to happen, is that at least Slushpool and maybe F2Pool will continue mining on the original chain, while the remainder will be split at a ratio proportional to the profitability of mining each coin.
  
The only scenario that is 100% guaranteed to occur, is that miners will act like pragmatic businesses, and mine whatever makes a profit.
  
Consensus change requires support from a super majority of the ENTIRE community, not just miners, a handful of exchanges, and one rogue developer.
