I knew that it was originated from a btctalk thread friend but this was in 2013 while the term HODL as mentioned in my post is on a 2008 movie.
So, is that where it was originated from? That is what i am wondering.

Guys, do you have any idea why this is happening for the last hour??Q?Q all red across the board with losses over 25% , what the fuck happened?
i cant find anything on the net , no news wtf

Well if it falls at 5800 then you should stop buying since this is a major red flag. BTC under 6k is totally not supported as it breaks market structure. Anything below 61.8 Fib at this time is red flagged man.

Mostly according to Alessio, glad you are a viewer, and common sense. Alessio may have not seen this drop,he is a trader not a psychic after all,  but he did quite some times stretched out the dangers of BTC falling below certain levels.

@_date: 2018-06-13 17:04:19
Well, it seems that you are uncapable of engaging in a polite conversation man.
Be well , cheers.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:22:58
Losses too.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:54:22
Welcome onboard man :)

I understand your logic, it stands. But in my case my profits ( in FIAT ) were reinvested into alts. 
IRL taking out profits is indeed what makes an investment profitable, a successful one that is.
But knowing your all time highs / lows is also an investment indication , mainly for tracking your portfolio's performance.
In our case, in cryptoverse, taking profits would mean liquidating to FIAT and/or reinvesting into alts.
Dont you agree ?
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:33:29
No,I love YOU.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:30:58
You and most people here failed to get my point, but it's ok. After all this is Reddit.
Nothing to see here well, move on.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:09:52
I simply cannot understand why are you so hostile man? We are not measuring our dicks here.
If you disagree then ok. But there is no reason trying to disrespect me.
Jesus. When did you all got so impolite ?
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:53:17
Well , allow me to have some doubts regarding the whole crypto and blockchain tech, it seems that you have already made up your mind regarding the market, right ?
Try to maintain a neutral attitude man , after all all markets worldwide are manipulated , dont you agree ?
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:59:29
Well, there are 2 options here.
The 1st one is that your are joking , so ok. Not so funny but well maybe some people laughed.
The 2nd is that you are really asking , so in this case. Yes it is real , i am a beta tester of bittrex and binance and so far i have gathered almost 11,5 btc just for participating. Believe me son.

hehehe yeah, but still his analysis has a base.
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:35:48
I am waiting for a proper reentry point truth be told, I was expecting a big drop since mid September, when I liquidated almost everything. I am all in USDT right now.
I was thinking of positioning myself in the 5700 range but I have a feeling that next stop is 5100 5200 before doing a mini rally back up.
Surely, no one can predict nothing here. We all listen to our gut I believe.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:01:36
i am literally crying man ahahahahah

Give this guy an upvote , he is the future of crypto.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:50:46
I d like to believe that COMMON SENSE AND RESPONSIBILITY can stop people from lending in order to "invest"/ GAMBLE in crypto. Jesus man, is this post even serious or are you trolling?!
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:37:38
Sure why not?
You are young enough to not having any immediate financial needs, and crypto can be fun and possibly could make you interested into financial assets and investments growing up.
So, yeah. Buy some BTC with your 100$ or even better try to buy a cheap coin with them preferably below the top 100 list, just for the fun of it. :) 
Good luck kid.
