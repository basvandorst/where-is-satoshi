Just buy and hold now.

Bitcoin is in its infancy too. Merchant adoption is not even close to 10%. Once places start receiving (POS) point of sale systems to accept it. Game Over.

The Halving will drive this all in the grand scheme.

This is a clear sign of why we need to make BTC easier to understand.
Look for the insights in these newb articles.

My disbeliever step-brother and I have an on going bet. 
If Bitcoin, does not break 20k again in the next 3 years, he wins. If it does, I win.
The loser has to stand at an intersection with a written sign the other gets to craft....

Further reassurance, all of us here, that truly understand. Are onto something big and the masses will come later when things are simplified.

Christian. I don’t believe so. We’re already marked with social security numbers and tracked as it is by IPs. I think the mark is more like being chipped or something. 
Funny how the atheists get so off topic so quick. Not a religious debate question regarding the existence of God. Chill peeps, its okay for others to believe or not to believe.
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:06:13
Vader, Dad?
@_date: 2019-04-06 21:15:00
So many ignorant statements. Why does the news continue to comment on things they are not educated on?
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:41:52
Youre an angry elf.

Theyre paid off to FUD. Not everyone can be this stupid to not understand the same thing happens with fiat.
@_date: 2019-12-02 04:23:05
Ive always felt like it would be something physical.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:54:03
We got one more sudden downfall still.
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:41:17
What stops people from sending the BTC to a trusted friend outside the US? I guess this would be considered laundering?
@_date: 2019-04-06 01:48:49

These people are just BS’ers or too old to grasp technology.

@_date: 2019-04-07 19:21:57
Could you imagine that being your job? I would hate it so much. They talk about depressing and negative stuff 95% the time.
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:18:59
Guessing theyll send you the keys right after???
@_date: 2019-04-06 23:20:31
Yea if the EMA collides with the southern hemisphere during a solar eclipse and ETF approval goes through? 
@_date: 2019-04-01 17:23:18
Great logical video! Thank you. Of course, no one can predict the future. But, if you had to say based off prior trends. Where do you see the new potential ATH on the next Bull Run? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:00:20
Bitcoin could lay dormant for years. I will still hold and keep buying. 
Only a matter of time for adoption.

What would you guys say are the top 5 reasons to go as an enthusiast? I’m not a dev, don’t work for a blockchain company (although I’ve been trying to find a healthcare focused one)? 
Trying to justify the $199 and travel.

I feel your pain. Truth is, they only want to bring it up when its negative and in their favor. When its booming, its amazing how silent they are.
