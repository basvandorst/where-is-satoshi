The Nobel Prize for Economics is not real and not given by the same endowment that gives the five real Nobel Prizes—physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and medicine/physiology... it is actually put together by the central banks and headed up by the Swedish Central Bank. 
That is why such "luminaries" as Paul Krugman wins the "prize" for economics, because he writes and repeats such pablum as "The Dollar is best because it is backed by guns" and that the US should be borrowing more and "kicking the can" of debt down to future generations. 
Satoshi will never win that prize and if he did, we'd then know that the conspiracy people who believe Bitcoin was actually created by the NSA may actually be onto something.
Edit to add one of many links about the prize:

I don't know if they are the same party, but its obvious that there is an opportunistic party here that is taking advantage. I think if you add in the timing of JPMorgan's laughable, attempted hit-job on bitcoin, I think you get a better idea of the size and shape of who has the motive, money, and intention to spread as much FUD as possible. Like an animal which is cornered and lashing out in every direction in order to seem larger than it really is, the central bankers' alliance is having a problem with existence as fiat comes to its end.  
Reggie Middleton did a nice job dissecting the JPM presentation with ease,
  
unfortunately the general public won't be allowed to see/hear such a rational rebuttal for the time being as they are now on the receiving end of the echo chamber of the shill media and twitter trolls. 
There is definitely a larger game being played here.... its speculative to wonder about Karp's role in setting up this up, whether he's in on something or just a 'useful idiot' who is mouthing what someone who he thought sounded correct when they told him about 'transmal'.... but the DDoS attack as the filler between MtGox and Silkroad 2 is too convenient for words.
It is going to be fun to watch the extended geek community rise to meet these challenges and we get closer to a world where the internet "goes dark" for the "powers that be" and their observation/manipulation because of an encrypted p2p network they can't control.  Its these time when the striekers are freaking and the weak hands are peeing their pants and selling, I get the most excited for the future!

As the US's central bank continues to buy treasury &amp; mortgage-backed security bonds off the open market, big banks and hedgies continue to borrow money at little or no interest or to dump gold/silver/copper contracts on the open market for cash to use to acquire those bonds first and frontrun the fed's purchases. (even with the so-called 'tapering')
Then the so-called "too big to fail/prosecute" take those profits and stash them in their interest bearing "dark pools" of capital and reducing the velocity of money to record lows.
So in effect, more dollars are being printed making each one worth less, at the same time, billions of dollars are getting stashed away reducing the supply of dollar into the real economy. 
Government spending, or the cutting thereof will do nothing to stop the debt as long as debt is being monetized by the central bank. We won't have hyperinflation until the stashed cash begins getting spent, not when the government borrows more freshly printed bills. There's pretty good evidence to show that they are spending this cash, just look for the assets that are the most inflated.... luxury property, "art", and other 'greater fool' assets are through the roof. Meanwhile, the plebs down below get to pay the same price for less content in the products they buy at the store from a salary never worth less. 
To bring this back to bitcoin, I think we have seen it go from $10 to $1000 because it is a very effective and public absorbent of central banker's inflation.

Granted, I should have qualified that I meant that its stupid to apply the securities regulations to bitcoin exchanges as they are actual human-motivated markets and not high-frequency-trading algos pretending to be a 'free market.'

I fell in love with bitcoinity last year during the mania when I was watching exchange rate go up and down and a gif of a roller-coster ride appeared. Then, when hit new highs and it suddenly Joel Grey and Liza popped up and "Money makes the world go around" from Cabaret played... later, when it crashed from 260 to 55, Darth Vader came on and yelled "Noooooooo!"

If the bitcoin ecosystem were a town, then when the town was still new, MtGox was the fanciest and biggest building around with 80% of the trade volume .... eventually other buildings were built around it that served the same purpose, but because of its size--newcomers and presstitute gawkers flocked to MtGox and falsely equated the building itself with the entire ecosystem.
Then someone started to see problems with the building's construction and began warning others; to which, MtGox seemed to respond like the builders of any Titanic, "They just have it in for MtGox!" and summarily ignored the warnings and continued to take in new rubes creating more of an ever-escalating, dangerous situation.
Still, despite some very smart people trying to warn others that the building was not only what it seems, is down-right dangerous to be near; and still, newcomers and gawkers got taken in by the supposed grandeur and historical presence of the building and trusted their own greed over the warnings.
But then even more citizens living in the town started to realize, despite its fancy exterior, the interior was literally held together with rubberbands and snot....not unlike a building on a movie set--a fancy front piece held up with poles masking a tiny little room. Suddenly a small gust of wind comes along and part of the fake building falls apart, so MtGox blames the trees that the poles were cut from as being flawed. Presstitutes issue headlines: "Flaw in trees means no building is safe!"
Now it seems like not only was it poorly constructed, but the people running it insistently forgot to lock any of the fake doors and fake windows and are encouraging the presstitutes to continue writing total falsehoods about the safety of all windows and doors. 
Despite all the warnings, a bunch of 'consumers' flooded into town after being attracted by a specter of easy money and ran into the poorly constructed building without even bothering to listen to the people who have been living in the town from the beginning--but rather, only repeating all the sensational presstitute's headlines.... and we're supposed to pity them and what then? BAIL THEM OUT? 
Did you start a thread on how we should be more understanding about the people who rushed into Silkroad 2 as well?

Coinbase is not an 'orderbook' exchange, it buys up btc and sells them to customers.... they way, they avoid the US's stupid 'securities' regulations which would govern it. This way, customers are buying/selling a product, which happens to be bitcoins, from/to coinbase using their US bank account.

This was one of the first stories I found when I started getting into Bitcoin a couple of years ago and doing the initial research... of course, paypal is pretty open about the fact they can and will seize or freeze accounts for up to 6 months if they don't like it's users' politics.

Bitcoin's exchange rate doesn't exist in a bubble, its a function of relative stability of legacy currencies and their value relative to each other, sovereign bonds, and interest rate manipulation.   I consider bitcoin's value as solid and its relative drop compared to the dollar reflects the dollars's strengthening position given the Bernanke's signal of QE easing. 
 However, the velocity of the dollar is all-time low and the unemployment rate of phDs willing to flip burgers is over 14%... rational thinking would tell us that a small group of dumb-but-wealthy people is sitting on all the cash that used to create smart-people-jobs while all the smart-but-poor people are hedging their skills in non-traditional economic endeavors.... such as Bitcoin.  imho at least.

Tulsa now has a Bitcoin Meetup! Everyone in Green Country is welcome!   
We've only had one meetup so far; plans are in the works to set up a regular Tulsa Satoshi Square.  Meetings are informal and loose, its the perfect place for people interested in Bitcoin but haven't met anyone else using or trading them.  We talk news, economics, and the tech of Bitcoin.
Next meetup will be Thursday July 18th.

Paypal would put so many caveats and fees on every bitcoin-related transaction, only the most gullible, stupid people would choose to use it. 
In other words, no doubt most of the idiot consumers in the US will only come into contact with bitcoin through paypal should they begin to accept it.

The quotes around the word "Libertarian" denotes that I intended the word not literally, but sarcastically, as none of the other attributes of these "people" actually match up or makes sense when taken on whole. 
This type of "Libertarianism" (notice the quotes again? do we remember what quotes around a word means?) has been branded by Max and Stacy as "the American School economics" because it seems to be a limited, yet vocal minority of "people" in the US who happen to often be white, privileged, economically advantaged males who "wah wah" about 'their freedom' being taken away... where 'freedom' is defined as 'externalities of business that effect others' and 'being taken away' is defined as 'being held responsible.' 
I know Libertarians... I may even be one, but over the last three years in Tulsa, OK (where Oral Roberts is NOT the punchline of a joke but revered by Rubes as a "contributor" to the "culture" here), I've had a front row seat for the laughing stock that is the "Vulgar Libertarians." They are anti-government, so they even think of themselves as "Anarchists" sometimes, but they are pro-authority and certainly anti-labor; basically, they are extreme crypto-Statists who really want a Theocratic State run by Billionaires (as long as they are ones who pick the leadership). Hell, there was even some of them with the local Occupy group in 2011 who wanted to stop everything at the GA to pray that "leaders will see the error of their ways" and that Gawd will make the markets free again so the "middle class" will stop shrinking.  
Its a huge joke and a huge problem for real Libertarians, because this is becoming the popular image of American-School "Libertarianism" and being used against all non-statists on some levels.

I know exactly what you are talking about....

Something that's bothered me all day.... this guy managed to evade for this long, and he didn't encrypt his wallet or do just that....brainwallet?  Did they torture him? Did they just seize a computer with the bitcoin-QT client and can see the total bitcoins but can't actually spend them without said passphrase.  Something is not right about this.
