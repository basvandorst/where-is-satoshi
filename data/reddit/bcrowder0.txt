From what I've read, yes it's set up in a way that its basically betting/ gambling.. er.. I mean speculation

1. After China banned it, there was a dip then huge surge. 
2. Lightning network, altcoins
Blockchain is here to stay my friend
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:01:21
It was already over 12.5 ... so you mean sideways from here for another 3 days? Yawn

If you send from your ledger to mine, how will they know
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:37:09
Yep now everyone and their mom is interested in shorting bitcoin. 
Time to go long!

It keeps fluctuating from 12-15 for another couple days or weeks then a bull market again in anticipating tax return season

Yeah totally, go for it. None of us have ever thought that. Let us know how it goes. 
Most successfully btc traders that I've known have switched to alt coins to day trade

Lol at the bold. So true
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:10:26
I call it a bubble. And I'm ready to buy if it dips. Lol... 
Edit: bitcoin is not a bubble, but the price is in a bubble. I'm a long term believer but sitting out til mid Jan
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:46:57
Thank you for the support! Going against your emotions and sticking to a plan is definitely not easy!

 Wall street whales vs bitcoin amateurs. Futures will certainly be interesting. Get the popcorn ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:33:32
This is why I say there needs to be more pairing of other alt coins like ltc.. everything is paired to btc (maybe eth) so everything gets pulled down with btc

"Looking for shitcoins"
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:53:22
I will dollar cost average and buy in more. But a tiny bit each month... the amount I can afford to lose. Thats really how I should've done it from the beginning and then ya, I'd still have some skin in the game. But I look at buying in more as a new investment now that my first goal is met, so I will not be kicking myself at all for "missing out on profits"
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:11:50
I agree. I have super mixed emotions when ppl post about trying to convince other ppl to invest. I encourage providing them info, but not necessarily encouraging them to buybuy buy!!

 Yes this accounts for taxes, thank you. Good advice like this is why Reddit is awesome
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:42:05
I don't think it goes lower than 5k and if it heads there, it'll spike right back up to 8-9k and then right back to where we are now. Or this is the bottom. Maybe invest a portion now, and save some to dollar cost average over the next couple months. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:46:40
 amen brotha!
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:49:27
If you have cash... why wouldn't you just invest however much you want in bitcoin and just bill the guy for more cash? I don't really get why you are going all or nothing here. If 30k of bitcoin is worth more than the cash you have, just invest what you want and take the 30k?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:09:57
I agree with you, my transactions are way faster and cheaper than what "they" say they are. Fishy
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:26:59
I will!! But ill also make it clear that it's their decision

Did I mention that I'm having bitcoin withdrawals already? Withdrawals like a drug! Lol what a fricken month
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:43:05
They charge a spread and that's how they make their money. They could set the price at whatever they want. Some people use 3-4 exchanges and make transactions based on the difference in prices on each exchange. Obviously, volume is important to each exchange so they'll naturally complete with each other to keep the prices similar. But they can charge you whatever they want, whatever people are willing to pay
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:26:51
And it goes up and down a lot. Just like a good man

You can't invest in the internet as a general thing. It's more like crypto=internet. 
"Its not just about picking the right market, but the right position in the right market" - some guy in a neighboring cubicle 10 years ago. But still true
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:30:27
No but if by Jan 15 it is not above 30k, ill buy again. I'm terrified of the futures thing and the historical early Jan dip.

@_date: 2017-11-15 15:44:29
Wow dude because if many gold coins will get you 1 life, but 1 bitcoin would get you many lives, then bitcoin is better than gold. 
And if the difference of value shows that bitcoin is more valuable than gold, then that's what makes it better...
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:09:54
If the ledger or trezzor company releases a compromised update/ firmware or something like that. Or has a secret backdoor they can access. 
Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but trying to figure out why its so much safer than coinbase or electrum
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:54:43
Not sure tbh... A better looking display/ font? That's the kind of display and font used in 90s movies and tv shows. The casing too looks pretty cheap. I guess I was expecting something looking more like an iPod nano

@_date: 2017-11-26 08:51:24
Coinbase is a wallet, an online one. A lot of people use a ledger nano or trezzor as an offline storage method. It's apparently much safer and you have possession of your coins instead of coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:09:47

False. People get interested at different times and don't necessarily go into the news archives once they do. Spiking to almost 8k has attracted a whole new wave of bitcoin noobs, who are just waiting to say I told you so to their noob friends, and who need current events to do so.

 It is used for large transactions A LOT right now. Coffee? No. But anything over a grand doesn't usually need extremely fast tx times or low fees. What bitcoin is being used for now, the fees and tx times are actually reasonable.

Deposit directly to gdax from bank account is faster than depositing to coinbase usd wallet (If youy have coinbase, you have a gdax account). Then you can instantly buy or withdraw to your coinbase account
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:41:26
Depending on fees or whatnot, I'd put in a small amount on a fixed schedule, and remove your emotions. Say, 10% every day at noon, or every other day at noon, and do it no matter what. 
Timing the market is hard

 Lol, I told myself not to laugh if someone gets hurt. I still laughed
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:42:54
Nice to know. I bought off Amazon, but made sure to choose a different seller, one with thousands of feedback instead of 9 (which was the default because the one with 9 feedback was 3 bucks cheaper)

@_date: 2017-11-19 10:55:53
How does one test it with a wallet rebuild?
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:47:40
Buy a little bit at a time and hold it. Don't try to time the markets. Never buy at an all time high, buy more when it dips. But keep it super simple. Day trading is really hard. Psychological mind fukc. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:31:33
Aaaand it's back
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:34:40
Great advice. The default option was to buy from someone with 9 feedbacks. I paid like $3 more to buy one from a seller with thousands of feedback. I feel a lot better
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:47:00
Hard to imagine that happening. If it does, I can still see bitcoin surviving as not the real culprit and coming out on top with the publicity it receives
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:55:59
What are un circumstances
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:30:16
This made me laugh, thank you
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:43:07
My understanding is the latter... they move into other alts which move opposite of bitcoin. 
But for this noob so far, it seems like the alts are all moving together, so I dunno

This is great info. Definitely doing this, I hope others are able to get this good advice. Rock on brotha
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:54:13
Ya, a wallet would cost you up to 30% of your investment. I'd just let it sit
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:31:38
 No, but you affect the spread
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:24:50
I would do something along the lines of 10% of your investment every 1-3 days, and if it goes up, 10% more, but if it goes down, 15% more, over the next 2 weeks ish
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:56:07
There is always a chance. As far as I understand, you're best off waiting to download any upgrades before checking social media sites (advice from the trezzor website, link needed) ... they also claim that they will never shut down because they just love bitcoin so much, which for me was not reassuring. 
But still, the hardware wallet seems like the best route to go

This is what I did and im a total noob, it was easy to get done, took about 8 mins
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:42:59
No. It's the ease of use and general acceptance that is holding it back. Fees are too high for small purchases right now. 
But also, companies are rumored to offer discounts if you use bitcoin, for the reason you mentioned. 
But but, when you spend bitcoin, you should buy more to replace it. As a merchant, when receiving bitcoin, you can always convert it to fiat, so essentially the risk/reward of value today vs. tomorrow is totally up to both the consumer and merchant
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:33:49
No. If so, maybe 9950 or something right below
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:14:17
Anything under 10k might be the buy point now. The farthest I think it'll dip is 8k, but I can see a lot of people waiting for anything under 10k now
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:45:57
I feel like at best, it will be like visa, mc, amex and discover. Not just Amazon or Facebook. But they won't be equal, one will trump the other 3 but the other 3 will still be there. All speculation though 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:26:29
Honestly it would take minutes to load, now it's like changing a tv channel (and has been). If tx times are even 10-20 mins now, they'll still be seconds if making that same comparison
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:48:11
I show him my account balance every day (co worker). Then I offered to buy him stuff (e.g.. a taco) if it hits certain prices. 
After just a few weeks and several tacos, he's finally asking the questions like where to buy and how much to start with instead of telling me to stfu already. The last spike to 8k almost had him, I was gonna buy him a full meal, lol
