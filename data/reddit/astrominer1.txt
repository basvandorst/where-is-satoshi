Agree, bitcoin finally represented as a credible alternative.  Kudos bitpay.  Especially liked this ad -

I think this articles sums up mining nicely (  Ofc I still bought an antminer and a Rasp PI just to experiment for the heck of it - it's been fun and I learnt stuff, telling people to not mine doesn't make sense when not taken into context of the person asking the question and what they want to gain from doing so.    Not everyone wants to make a quick buck!

Yup agree totally, here have the last of my changetip bits 0.40000 mBTC @_date: 2014-11-06 23:53:44
could be, although I saw this article right before the upward trend started ..

Great renders, you might have just inspired me to dust off my copy of Blender!

Not everyone has the luxury of food, clothes and clean water, you might want to remember that next time.

Thanks for dropping by and sharing your music. 1000 bits @_date: 2014-12-04 22:24:41
Such a short-minded teacher.   I can't see anything wrong with it at all, provides some well rounded history on the topic.   You should be proud he see's BTC as the next technological step.  You might want to remind them that a high street retailer in the UK - CEX buys and sells electronic goods for bitcoin.   Do a search in this reddit for more links.   Tell your son not to lose heart, without a dream we wouldn't have flight, a moon landing or even a manned trip to mars.  No moon pun intended ;)

I registered my interest on their website and have been receiving emails to buy gems.   Whilst I got the early concept of sending bitcoin to users in a tipping style transfer social media app and advertisers paying me in bitcoin, the emergence of transferring my bitcoin (de-centralized) to gems (centralized) has me confused - perhaps I'm missing something?

Cheers we're not talking large amounts here by todays exchange rate but you never know I guess, my bits could be worth more or less in 10 years time.  Kind of like a part B I suppose, is there any value in splitting paper wallet deposits up, how much is too much to leave in a single paper wallet even if you've been ultra overkill with the protection?

Yup you have a very good point there.

If I buy a £25 itunes card, my account is credited £25, not £25 minus a 4% charge, that's why I'm out.

I'm shocked :o btcguild has been my home for a couple of months and I've really enjoyed the simplicity of the website, the mining stats and the uncluttered UI.  It's a real shame the sense of impending doom is creeping in, not just from the big corp pools but also the pressure from US gov regulators.  I guess the recent adoption of mainstream bitcoin has got someone's attention.   I raise a glass sir and wish you well in your future endeavours.

I tip my hat to anyone whom actually builds their own solar panel array, certainly the future.   Let's see some pictures please :)
@_date: 2014-12-23 22:05:26
Thanks for the detailed response, most appreciated. Yes it did answer some of my questions, as an idea I support the concept, as a product to compete with other big players I remain to be convinced.
@_date: 2014-11-01 15:20:50
Thanks hiver, appreciate the tip on both counts !
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:37:00
I doubt a reinvention of the logo or font would have much of a positive impact on adoption.   1Ƀ hmm doesn't look right to me, 1BTC on the other hand.

No stress in my corner, at least I know my investment isn't lining someone else's pocket.  It'll bounce back, the technology will win out.   Sound advice though, only buy what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:36:54
Yes correct its  apologies I didn't include in my original reply, I was on a mobile device. Lots of mistrust in this community, will note for future reference and no offence taken.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:07:06
Interesting theory, in principle though any potential gov sponsered mining will surface as those farms in it solely for profit cannot sustain the losses so they switch off (    One thing that did intrigue me back in Oct (or possibly Nov) was a sudden out of the blue sequential win from the same IP address and it did get me wondering - could a quantum computer mine ?
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:02:30
Call me cynical however some of the answers seemed a little too perfect, almost like fake profiling for players that know more about technology than they ought too.   Interesting read all the same, I suspect you aren't the only person lurking on tinder with a fake profile :). Sometimes lonely people are easy targets for those who prey on that demographic.

one day there might be a bank rush on paypal - at least with bitcoin, we know you can't have more than exists in circulation.
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:52:50
The story is plausible, using the words bitcoin or btc in any person to person bank transfer red flags your account.  A UK based exchange I use instant bans anyone who uses related terms in transactions so I believe the threat is real.

Aha spreading the love - I like it!  Cheers for the list of charities, very handy to have in one place.

Seeded an idea somewhere in Visa no doubt, I expect to see a bitcoin visa card sometime soon..... /doh

I thought QR codes solved this problem.  Of the examples given of stupid people is there a verified source that has analysed user mistakes or reversible transaction need?   I agree that if I order something in BTC and never receive it I'm taking a risk, isn't that the issue and in most cases both parties are known and can communicate and evidence the transaction for alternate claim with a receipt (i.e blockchain)
I don't agree in delaying confirmation of transactions.
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:27:03
That is part of the power of bitcoin, sending internet currency to a person rather than via lots of intermediaries who take their own cut of the transaction.  I hope to see tipping and voting scenarios using QR codes for this very reason, less money to the TV execs and more to the artists providing the entertainment.
