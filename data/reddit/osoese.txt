I doubt BOA made a new policy and decided to release it on Saturday so you can be on the phone with them on Sunday (a day that you can only reach like credit card and fraud lines) to find out about it and be able to let everyone here know.

because ....bitcoin!!
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:02:19
from the politician standpoint its the ability to issue more coins at will into your own budget and the ability to control the spend process which are the reasons for bitcoin exists so I think the real question is what features are needed to replace the politician :-D

If you don't want to be called a liar don't lie. You placed FUD and it doesn't add up. Merry Christmas to you too.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:21:15
Well, just because a liar says he is telling the truth doesn't make it any more true than someone who says he is calling a bank on Sunday to handle a situation that is clearly a business hours only call and then announces breaking news to the world about a new policy that doesn't exist. Liar FUD.

the loan is collateralized, but the paper note is then traded in for a low interest load against what would seem is money printed out of think air. It is based against a smaller reserve held by that lending institution. I think the percentage is 8:1 up to even 12:1 meaning for every $100 on deposit you can write $800 to $1200 in loans and trade in the paper instrument to a higher level bank who then sends the money to back that loan and borrows it from the bank above them eventually the central bank who gets it directly from the federal reserve or treasury. The entire scheme is like a ponzi if I understand it right.

bought a ZEC contract about 18 months ago and not sure if it was "profitable" but it was advertised as a 2 year contract and thats what I got. It put some ZEC on my address every day and they always paid. Its probably still going but the rewards are tiny now and I have written it off. I would not call them a scam, just not a good return on investment.

i think it was an ad - i noticed this time it was a forbes link so i agree probably not browser mining at forbes but the ad was up to no good whatever they had playing on it before

I agree with your headline. I think also that the decentralized nature of blockchain consensus is going to eventually cause separations of "heads of state" from state and move the power to the people. In that regard bitcoin is probably starting a power transfer all the way around, which just reinforces your headline so well. They say the golden rule is those with the gold makes the rules...

Yeah they said they listed us (EGEM) and a lot of fake trades but none of our members could ever get approved for trading - then finally they approved a few accounts but we were kind of over it and no one ever made a deposit to test. Sorry you found out this way - they were listed on bitcointalk in the scam section by multiple parties.

every transaction is recorded on a public ledger and its not too hard to eventually figure out who the address belongs to if they get associated with a known transaction. What he is saying is dumb criminals dont bother trying to create a new address pair or wash their coins through and exchange or monero or something. The police like that because they can follow the bitcoin back to whoever dumb ass coinbase eventually cashes it and see if that person was the criminal or who they got the funds from - as opposed to cash where its a lot harder even with ink dye packs and serial number tracking because of the nature of cashing cash...lmao

upvoted on spirit, but then came to say this - and also crypto should not be associated with stocks as that is what pisses off SEC imo

well, they still track the history of the funds on the blockchain. It's not too hard to automate this process with a database and server setup so that the computer system alerts you, tracks the addresses it passes through for associations to other known addresses and ip addresses, etc. I mean, its kind of a small neighborhood on the web in terms of traceability. You know how fast you can ping EVERY ip ipv4 address in the world for a port scan? Its less than a day and in fact just about an hour I think. Like, to take your "for example" to another level lets say it went to binance... well that deposit address at binance is tracked to a person thanks to KYC. The only thing I can think of is to go to a non KYC exchange and switch out the coin type, withdraw and leave... but are there many non KYC exchanges with any volume? Let's say you stole the bitcoin from the binance hack... thats a lot of coin to move without kitting a KYC somewhere. People track it so if you start depositing to a non KYC exchange they figure it out and then people are on that exchange. FOr sure an astute person can kind of keep their coin anonymous but its a lot more work and most of the people that those law enforcement people are tracking just are not that smart. That is how they end up in the middle of a law enforcement officer watching their BTC transactions in the first place.

Pretty cool. Not overly slow tbh and pretty clever.

Not everything needs to be a conspiracy theory, I agree. However, bitcoin and crypto in general do totally threaten big bank business model entirely
1) bitcoin users don't need a bank to store funds
2) bitcoin users can send money domestic or international without bank paywall or oversight
3) bitcoin merchants can take bitcoin and not pay visa and mastercard (as much as 40% of bank revenue is merchant services)
remember the ad **VISA its everywhere you want to be**? I think part of that ad means its also sponsoring the financial shows with advertising.
The only thing they have left is regulation and control of the money supply as in they can print funds out of thin air at the fed level and it gives those banks a license to create their own wealth and get bailed out by governments. bitcoin even kind of thwarts that
4) bitcoin makes it blatantly obvious that fiat has no real value and puts a small percentage of power brokers in charge of the fiat money game. This includes everything you are used to
This may be one of the reasons why the gen block had that financial times article in it?
And finally:
5) bitcoin users don't need permission to do any functions and that puts the govt at a loss
there is probably more, like
6) businesses can use a crypto to launch and circumvent govt processes
and all that other nonsense which now we get into the bitcoin is just a criminal device area....
At the end of the day I don't think you need to be a conspiracy theorist to see that bitcoin and crypto should absolutely be bashed by financial media and banks where they can. I am not sure adoption will help them keep their business model in any semblance of its current monopoly and they are like a termnal patient without outward signs to show yet. The only thing they will have left is loans and interfaces to fiat. If everyone is using crypto I'm sure a crypto fed will find a way to establish loan structures for housing on crypto that is mass adoptable. Over time banks and merchant services are ded. They know it before we know it because they are monitoring those profit channels with all that data they consume tracking trends and spending. Financial services firms built the big data market imo. So, it does not take a lot of conspiracy to logically think their advertising against crypto to the aging demographic that supports their business model.
In another ten years we won't need this same conversation, but I would assume that these same banks have a big spending going on in the quantum computer realm and other areas that wold potentially find vulnerabilities into the crypto landscape. Any sensible business operating in their line of work better. If you are a bank its not "if you can't beat them join them," but rather "kill or be killed."
So, in summary I think its not a conspiracy at all but just the way life works.
