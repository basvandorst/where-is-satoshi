Sweden is not North Korea, it's an EU member state like the UK, with a fair and impartial court system. Nobody forced Assange to come. If he doesn't think EU law applies to him, he should have stayed away.

It's not. Saying so does not make it so. If it was legally binding UK would have most likely complied with it.
e: International organisations like the UN have lots of expert panels whose job is to give non-binding recommendations and legal opinions that are meant to act as guidelines or put political pressure on member states, but no UN treaty demands the member states to follow them.
Basically binding = do this or we'll meet in court, non-binding = shame on you if you don't do this.

How did you like Chavez and his policies?

Semantics, a Swedish high court ordered his detention to make him comply with the investigation and participate in the possible trial.

This is FUD, bitcoin transactions are actually free and instant and decentralised and anonymous and

In the same way that 70% of drivers consider their driving skills above average?
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:40:33
Not the UN but a UN working group, a panel of experts. Their decisions are legally non-binding recommendations, unlike EU law which is binding.

Perhaps he should not have fled Sweden in the first place.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:24:26
Many people here are heavily invested in bitcoin themselves. Their incentive is to try to make you and people like you buy more to pump up the price. Is is possible that their advice serves them and hurts you.
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:42:49
Fair enough, he should have returned to Sweden voluntarily when they issued the international arrest warrant so the extradition request would not have been necessary.

A true mystery

Liberum veto will be the perfect governance mechanism for bitcoin.

Simple really, I don't spout misogynist "banter" or feel the need to defend other idiots doing it, and as a consequence people don't actively avoid me.

So you're saying that a bitcoin money launderer getting arrested somehow proves that bitcoin money launderers are untouchable?

Of course not.

Of course it works. You may have no sense of shame left anymore, but it makes it clear to all bystanders that you're someone to be avoided.

So if there's no backing, what is this "assigned" value?
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:12:01
That's nonsense, if they actually wanted to the govt could disrupt the network as much as they like by shutting down exchanges, arresting people who run nodes and confiscating miner hardware.

Wow, a conventional prepaid credit card is cheaper and more convenient than bitcoin?
An even better idea, just skip the bitcoin step entirely and use a debit card.

I've heard that if you know just the right incantations the judge has no option but to dismiss the case against you! You have to be very careful with the pronunciation though.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:35:12
It basically means anonymous bearer instruments that can be used for money laundering/skirting laws. Debit cards are connected to your person so they do not count.

This is why we keep hearing about all those success stories of restaurants and bars accepting bitcoin.
