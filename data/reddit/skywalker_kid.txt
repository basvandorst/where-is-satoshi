I think the market sentiment combined with past pattern trajectory will make for an interesting lead-up to the halving.  The important part, for me at least, is that it can take up to a year after the halving for the peak to be reached. That means hodling is the best choice for now.

Crypto sentiment is growing stronger in the light of recent world events and moves to regulate by SEC. These type of things ten to move more wary investors into BTC.

As the development continues, crypto plays a larger and larger role in everyday operation and industry. As it moves into more legal and governmental areas, we will see it become an everyday topic in the headlines.

The point you make in your article about debt rates being out of control is spot on. The parallel to the 2008 debt rate crisis is too familiar for comfort, and I also believe that Bitcoin is a great store of  value in the face of an economic downturn.

This is a great step for Sbux to work with payment processor to take crypto. We will see more people, younger gen probably, start to look at crypto a bit more.
