It sounds like you're just in it for a quick buck, in which case yes it's probably best that you do sell

Well its a proposal to the G20 so it could lead to general regulations across the board. France and Germany together are also very influential in shaping EU law, especially with the UK leaving.

Bitcoin being the prime example of such a system, and the original

Do you even bitcoin?
A BIG part of its utility is that it acts independently of governments!

Markets are second-order chaotic systems, meaning they are **highly** unpredictable because the market *responds* to any predictions that are made about it - thereby partially invalidating that very prediction.
In short, our understanding of markets and the tools we use to predict them are crude at best, and can offer no real long-term insight.

It's just that - a pump. People invested in the success of bitcoin cash artificially pump up the price, it's not natural growth at all

Bitcoins ledger is the most immutable and secure of any, that includes ethereum

This is exactly what HODL was coined for. 
It signifies that, despite dramatic crashes, you believe in the long-term utility and vision of bitcoin. I certainly do, it's world-changing tech, and I will hodl because I know that peaks and dips are irrelevant to its long term value.
If you are scared and want to sell, especially if at a loss, this crypto business might just not be for you.

For anyone who doesn't understand why Bitcoin is still the most valuable cryptocurrency, or thinks its outdated tech. This is what make it valuable and, imho, still the no.1 in crypto now and for the foreseeable future:
1. Security. It's blockchain is by far the most secure - not only by design and hashrate, but this has been proven over nine years of attempted hacks, attacks, takeovers etc. It's Proof of Work method is well tested. Other cryptos are not trying to compete on security (they can't), so go after "fast and cheap" transactions instead.
2. Decentralization. This is one of the founding and most important tenets of bitcoin, and that which allowed it to even succeed in the first place. Bitcoin is consensus lead and has no central authority, whereas many other of these "fast cheap" cryptos rely on control by central nodes, companies etc. IF a cryptocurrency isn't decentralised, is there really much point in it?
3.  Development. Bitcoin is aiming to develop solutions to scalability, transaction time, price etc. **without** compromising the two points above. This is a highly complex and involved task! But it is proving possible, and with Segwit, LN and other developments down the road, Bitcoin is proving to be the most technologically advanced crypto out there. (Which makes sense, it has an army of developers behind it)
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:46:03
All coins that are faster an/or cheaper have to compromise on security, decentralisation, or both

If you're paying more than 3-4 dollars in fees you're using the wrong wallet. (for the record I still think those fees are too high, but I know that they will come down on future) 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:47:28
It certainly can be changed. Many solutions that would make it faster and cheaper would come at the cost of decentralisation and security (see many of the altcoins as examples). There are many solutions in development, it just depends on what the consensus is. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:35:28
Did it hurt when you pulled those numbers out your arse? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:37:16
As much as I'd love this to be true, I'm glad we can all see this is nonsense!
The price prediction may well come true, but his method is about as useful as a marzipan dildo
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:13:18
That's a good mindset to have. In crypto, trust no-one. (that's kind of the point)

Segwit has already been implemented in bitcoin, it did not require a hard fork. It was technically a soft fork

This sounds like they intend to regulate things like insider trading, pump and dump groups etc. Not a terrible idea imho, and won't harm bitcoin

Ignore the Panini guy. He's deliberately spreading fear all over the place. I'd say buy now (you'll be kicking yourself if it only goes up from here) , but don't listen to me either

Haha god I fucking hate coinbase. Glad it seems they've finally cottoned on that theyre only shooting themselves in the foot 
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:29:45


The fact is no other coin does those things as well as bitcoin. If they are the attributed you are measuring, bitcoin has the best tech out there
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:57:32
Regarding your security point - No. Bitcoin is the **most** secure, and has proven this over many years.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:22:43
To hodl means you accept that you cannot accurately time the market, and that the best long term strategy is therefore to hold. You don't know when the price will stop rising or stop falling, you don't want to end up with less btc by trying to time it
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:47:09
If I had to guess I would say up
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:21:45
We should admit it absolutely could go down to 5k, while maintaining that long term we expect it to be far, far higher.
That's realistic I think.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:24:45
Some of us do. I do. Adoption is still very early so there's only so many places I can use it. Until wider adoption, I hodl most of it.

Everyone remember: Most people making "predictions" are actually trying to influence the market one way or the other, rather than sharing any real insight. Make your own decisions!

The energy use secures the network. Like people say, think of all the energy indirectly used by credit card companies etc - huge buildings, employees, computer systems.
It is certainly not "wasted" energy, and the proportion of energy coming from renewables is increasing every day.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:00:54
That's fair enough, but the crypto space will recover and my opinion is that bitcoin will remain one of the top coins
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:57:16
Might do, might not. You won't get any actual insight from anyone.

I'm a big litecoin fan, but the fact is that litecoin has sacrificed a small amount of decentralisation and security in order to be faster and cheaper. That's the tradeoff and Charlie Lee is open about it. That's how it's designed.
What do you even mean by "better tech"
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:01:53
The market itself recovered, however. It depends on if you believe that bitcoin will remain as one of the top coins (I personally do)
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:00:09
There's been longer and larger dips than this
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:26:10
Ah yes, because after 1929 (where those stories come from) the stock market never reached an all time high again. Right? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:43:48
Other altcoins don't have a secure and decentralised network. None to the same extent as bitcoin has.
They compromise on those things to a degree in order to be cheaper and/or faster. But when LN is mature, and segwit, schnorr etc fully implemented, then what are those altcoins even for?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:27:32
Why are you even in this subreddit if you think bitcoin is a ponzi? I can't believe you're being upvoted for baseless crap. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:40:18
This is true,
But also the actual tech is better - no altcoin has tried to compete on the core technical attributes of security and decentralisation because bitcoin has those wrapped up. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:59:39
The bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked or maliciously changed, ever. That's amazing
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:08:33
Could do. You never know when the real bottom will be found though. That's why many of us hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:23:19
You said it yourself - its a pump (&amp; dump).
Its all the Roger and the bcash people can do to maintain some level of interest in their shit coin. These things are planned and coordinated.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:54:24
I think there's a bit more to it than this, but I'll give an outline (this assumes btc and ltc are operating at similar transaction volumes).
Litecoin has less time between blocks, i.e blocks are easier to mine. Easier to mine means less secure. Also because there's 4x as many blocks it requires better hardware to validate the blockchain, meaning fewer nodes and more centralisation. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:50:26
Firstly - hashrate, size of the network. Essentially "first-mover" stuff
Anything else with the "same tech" will have the same security, assuming equal market size, etc. But no other coin has that, and any that has the "same tech" will not overtake btc, because what's the point if its exactly the same?
There would only be a reason for a coin to overtake btc if it had different tech, and no coin with different tech has better security &amp; decentralisation
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:20:40
I suppose there's only so many times you can say HODL, but it's true. People have to understand that the price since November (probably even earlier) has been fueled almost entirely on speculation, rather than technology or usage. So many more people know about bitcoin now, and I really feel we're in a good position to see some long term growth. From here it may go up, may go down, but I'm confident that in a couple of years I'll be so so glad I didn't sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:54:56
