this should be a thing. mom sharing.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:52:11
mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:00:05
I'm not saying we'll have mass adoption in 3 years. I'm just saying the snowball effect hasn't even started yet. Mass adoption will take 10 years.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:10:57
i buy twice a week.
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:22:45
Not gonna happen. Bitcoin is still largely misunderstood and unusable for your average person. It is not easy to secure you keys and "be your own bank" and that's even if people want to do that which most of them don't.
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:08:03
to the moon!
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:13:08
nope. standard operating procedure for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:57:12
5200 in 10 days
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:55:31
i see. use coincap app on iOS.
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:06:40
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:10:09
I'm curious if you've used this at all?
Its an HFT for crypto trading platform written in node.js
edit: here's another one I just found:
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:13:11
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:36:27
in addition to the block reward they also get the fees. presumably as block reward decreases the value of the fees go up.
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:24:04
What bitcoin? I don't have no bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:05:03
I prefer screenshots. Tweets get deleted.
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:55:57
haha. that is what happened to me. it was easier and less stressful to just buy and hold.
which exchange do you trade on?
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:03:24
I don't know.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:47:09
I have no idea what BTC is. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:21:51
I wish I knew how to read charts to where I was competent enough to do forex trading and thus crypto. Whenever I try I fail miserably.
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:17:33
I do believe we are in a simulation.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:34:31
it looks like its heading downward to me. but the lines prove otherwise! no idea where the logic for that assumption is that its a pump.
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:30:30
shidiot. i like that!
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:59:28
just spend it.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:39:31
i could let you define the parameters though like "alert me when a block takes longer than x hours|minutes"
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:47:56
sure it does. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:33:35

@_date: 2017-08-29 22:41:36
oh. wtf is USDT then?
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:36:00
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:35:37
did I say gdax? no. I said coinbase. Anyway, I don't give a fuck if you believe it or not. I was there. I remember everyone in my office buying when it hit 72.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:45:29
30 million is sitting in a landfill somewhere.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:10:13
seems like it would be a lot of spam to send you an SMS everytime a block is confirmed.

Tanking hard after that nice little run up.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:26:31


Your friend is an idiot if he listens to your advice.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:02:19
buy and hold.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:07:42
Satoshi said this would happen.
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:05:33
thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:17:05
isn't trading on margin for when you short it? if a crash happens that would be a good thing.
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:03:36
actually it hit 72. i remember.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:48:45
Hoping will buy a house and college one day.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:27:50
i love these random charts with lines. make it so!
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:54:05
well whatever it was its over now.
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:10:03
lol. the government would have a working internet.  you wouldn't. you wouldn't even be able to get your money out of a bank or pay your bills. You think they just going to keep internet going for residential ISPs?
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:09:43
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:08:16
no. you are.

Why not both?
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:51:14
Guns are loaded...
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:14:21
the idea is you login and setup your alerts and it would sms you when an alert is triggered.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:29:08

also a programmer. i only understand it at a high level.
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:05:16
don't risk it. get a new account.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:55:18
Can you do that?
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:36:56
you. you're the only one ITT
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:32:08
are you in your 70s?
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:55:30
mtgox or coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:35:22
She's expensive but well worth it.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:07:10
yes it did.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:12:01
i know about the conspiracy that bitcoin is a currency to control us. What about the gold bugs?
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:32:07
These problems existed long before the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:23:46
nobody says it can't.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:02:35
I already did.

This is the 500ms chart.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:06:39
if its been longer than an hour since last block then send an alert?

I tell them I am unofficially involved with The Black Death Group on the Tor network. j/k
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:32:00

@_date: 2017-08-13 22:44:32
i do the same thing for my kids.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:22:37
you're basically caught in the battle of gettysburg with Blockstream and their trojan horse trying to circumvent Satoshi's vision of a bitcoin.
i buy $10 twice a week. Been doing that for a couple of years now.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:55:26
sure they do. lol. i've been trading btc/usd for two weeks now
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:16:19

	    "currentsee": "bin/currentsee.js"
	  },

enslave you.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:42:06
 or 
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:48:40
either 2k or 4k by end of day today.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:52:57
You're assuming its going to be going up all the time. It doesn't.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:51:55
We don't owe you jack shit.
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:28:22
BCH SPV wallets!
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:14:38
Indeed they do. The bootstrap economy. Every bitcoin site used bootstrap.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:26:22
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:09:31
I think $5k this week.
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:57:55
i see 5k soon. don't know what you mean by 'cut it'
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:48:00
i watched it go from 1275 to 75.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:03:38
a short squeeze is shorter than a long squeeze.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:48:01

No it isn't. I fucking hate Google. DuckDuckGo is my friend now.

@_date: 2017-08-05 04:56:17
its like republicans and democrats. neither party wins and in the end everyone loses.
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:50:12
no. that actually IS ethereum.
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:16:43
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:54:50
i was wrong. i saw it posted on reddit after and thought it originated here. fuck it hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:30:48
I feel dirty when I have to cash out to pay bills. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:00:27
no good wallets for bch and btc is a shit show right now with high fees. Is it the fees that are gonna be $100k in 5 years? That I'll believe :P
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:20:00
Does anyone have the contact number for Bitcoin? My funds didn't show up.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:10:48

@_date: 2017-08-05 01:42:51
coincap on iOS
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:27:34
Annoying that I have to register just to click a button.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:20:19
wtf. i just check this like 5 minutes ago and it was &lt; 3k. Now its at 3100+
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:51:27
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:50:46
I don't  think you have any clue how blockchain works. I don't like you  either. You sound mean.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:09:27
3200 in 40 days
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:06:01
I was very concerned with all the shady bitcoin looking sites that it was a scam. Wish I had put $1k into it back when it was under 10 cents.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:14:20
Well yeah. Because I forked your mom.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:53:44
s/BREAKING/HODL/ if you want updotes.
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:09:44
You are supposed to report a gain/loss everytime you spend btc. A bit cumbersome to say the least. There are different methods of accounting you can use. Talk to an accountant.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:56:23
He was buying btc back in the &lt; .01 cents days. I'm sure he's still got plenty.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:14:05

-bash: currrentsee: command not found
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:59:46
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:49:34
even better.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:44:31
oh. well i didn't get it then. but still thought the alternative punchline was funny.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:10:12
Ahh sure. Screenshot could be faked.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:49:58
Sure, why not?
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:52:16
17 forks. nobody uses it.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:18:26
I saw $7 fees about 4 months ago. People have been talking about this for over a year now being a problem. Not sure where you've been.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:20:00
I didn't go all in, that would be crazy. I put a few thousand into it over the course of 6 months. I'm still holding. Will probably never spend them and pass them down to my kids one day.
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:21:28
It should be if you install with `-g` flag.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:33:30
It was Jim. He did it.
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:59:17
its already hit 3k about a month ago.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:02:48
Install electrum. backup your seed phrase. then send your coins to your electrum wallet address. I would test it with $1 first to make sure you did it correctly, then send the rest.
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:49:32
If there was an meltdown you would not have internet. So bitcoin would be basically useless.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:55:02
3500 by end of day. Hell maybe even next hour or two.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:52:53
HODL baby.!
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:01:14
i wish i knew jaxx had a doge wallet. i would have kept it there instead. that dogecoin core wallet was garbage.
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:57:35
new ATH. and acrash after. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:23:06
Little did we know, that Satoshi is real....on blockchain, on ledger, on segwit and bippin'.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:06:47
I'll show you!
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:12:36
panic buying and selling all the way to the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:43:00
not going to pop. this is no bubble.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:22:47
it crashed.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:24:27
i used thinkorswim with fake money for a month. Never did come out on top. So I realized I just sucked at day trading and didn't lose a dime from that.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:27:24
Backup your recovery phrase and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:50:28
There was a Hong Kong Agreement....and a New York Agreement...and some big fish are always promoting some new alternative to whatever the current agreed upon solution is.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:04:42
Hit 3003 on bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:51:42
Thanks. I will try this.
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:22:22
ok. that's definitely something I want as well.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:05:05
zero. i just wanted to fit in. :(
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:31:44
Give it to your mom. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:24:15
pump and dump
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:17:40
It's traceable.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:17:10
there isn't one yet that is very good. i think most businesses use bitpay or coinbase. But you can roll your own pretty easily with the blockchain.info apis.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:25:57
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:52:08
got pumped and dumped. someone who owned an exchange ran off with everyone's dogecoin. ask in @_date: 2017-08-10 22:01:57
and you're the expert because?
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:32:25
so its over. what hapepened? did we solve scaling problems/
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:29:26
It still has 2 weeks to go.
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:25:14
i don't understand.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:08:06
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:57:05


made me laugh. modern crimals in bitcoin era. "Please get back to us in 2 weeks when you have bitcoin in hand".
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:42:53
...also giving some silent fu's to previous co-workers who thought I was some crazy ponzi schemer.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:36:21
i'm with ya. i think 5k in the next month. 10k by end of year.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:58:37
none. i buy $10 twice a week for the past few years.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:48:51
oh that must be it.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:17:51
Yup. I've never had anyone take me up on the offer either.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:06:18
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:46:40
3? what's the 3rd one
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:21:52
It's Terminator coming back to warn us....or it might have something to do with Tengris 137
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:53:09
naah man. i got in at &lt; $4. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:31:34
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:27:53
Yup. I did that but the app won't accept the keys. I'm using them on cryptowat.ch no problem.
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:32:07
Yeah. It was all gold bugs with their shitty looking web sites. Those "I saved as HTML... in MS-word" type of quality.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:02:51
usually a rise and fall over the course of an hour or two is how I would define it.
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:33:06


no he hasn't. it never recovered.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:23:53
Right. just like arbitrage between exchanges only with a longer wait period. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:42:18
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:33:55
I doubt that. I'm sure bitcoin usage would be less than .00001% of their daily transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:01:42
Thanks. But I'm not working at the moment. I'm an out of work troll. Your suggestion is taken with great appreciation....kind of like your mom.
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:53:05
centralized control. the fed. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:37:54
IoT == Internet of Things. 
some bullshit tech jargon mumbo jumbo to refer to connected devices sending large amounts of data resulting in "big data" and the like. Basically your toaster emitting an event that sends data over the internet to its manufacturer.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:50:52
its like when you fuck the milkman.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:19:59
lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:03:11
for a second i thought you said "Too much fucking moon boys"
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:43:01
i failed philosophy for this reason.
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:53:03


you won't be able to pay your bills.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:32:02
Bitcoin IoT :)

double top. time to gtfo before it plummets.
edit: new ATH! $3157. lol

@_date: 2017-08-26 20:12:27
That makes no sense. These are not due to bch.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:17:06

This seems to be the fundamental thing people don't get. 'How do i get bitcoins?' -- 'You accept them'.
I have a small business that I do 100% in bitcoin. Its been great. Nobody bothers me, I need no permission from a bank.

@_date: 2017-08-06 03:18:00
Its difficult to grasp the concept. A lot of unfamiliar concepts to most people. There's also the "how the fuck do I use this shit?" problem. It took me awhile to discover Electrum and Jaxx. Most people will give as soon as the blockchain starts to download and it says "2 weeks left" in the progress bar. Also backups. Even if you can get through all the hurdles of finding the right wallet to use, people will still lose their life savings because they don't backup their seed phrase.
Imagine that happens to a lot of people....now all those people are telling others how they "got scammed". Its like one bad customer can destroy your reputation online by posting a bad yelp review.

Seriously. wtf is it 48 hours for? honest question.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:09:27
of course not. don't be a fool.
if you want to put maybe 20% max of your net worth into btc then I would do so over a long period. Like a year or two. Buy $10 twice a week no matter what the price. and now you have 2 chains so which one do you buy? smh
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:52:22
File a Sev 1 ticket.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:48:12

@_date: 2017-08-24 23:19:30
Don't use 2FA.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:00:39
so the price right now is $2700. Tomorrow it might be $2500 or $2900. we don't know. but I assure you it will fluctuate quite a bit over time even if the general direction is upward. You can try to time the dips and buy then. or you can just do what I originally said which was invest it in small amounts over time.
a lot of people buy the dips and sell the highs....then rinse and repeat. If you can figure out how to recognize the bottoms and the tops.

@_date: 2017-08-05 05:33:50
I see the gold bugs as a group who keep gold on hand incase the market crashes. They can still spend gold as its been accepted everywhere for centuries. But I do agree with them on one point. If it DID get that bad where you would need to use Gold as a currency then pretty much the Internet will be offline and Bitcoin is useless.

The second rule of Bitcoin is you do not buy more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:42:07
technically they are optional but you have a good chance of miners not processing your transactions. The miners can choose to ignore 0 fee transactions. The worst that happens is your transaction goes defunct in 72 hours and you get your coins back. But if you want it to go through in a few minutes then definitely include a fee. Idk what that is but it should be a few pennies once all this forking business resolves itself.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:38:17

I guess one of us is retarded. Pretty sure it isn't me. Then he allowed me to do a password reset. Same thing after I reset password says "Account is disabled". You guys are terrible.

@_date: 2017-08-03 05:27:03
Think about it this way. If you sink it all at once you lose the ability to buy low and sell high. Your stuck at whatever you paid $2700 right now. Maybe put $100/week then? You should look into investment strategies. This is called Dollar Cost Averaging. But I'm sure there are others that might work better for you.
If I were you, I'd take $250 and put it on poloniex. Then try to increase that $250 to $500 by day trading. In the meant time I'd still put $20/week into btc/bcc
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:48:29

it depends on your goals. if you use a regulated exchange expect to pay taxes on it eventually. As for when to buy, I would take your $500 and buy maybe $10/week.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:02:54
So they setup a buy order for 8000 BTC at about 300 bucks below current price? That would cause the price to drop wouldn't it?

haha. so true! Groinbase has already sold out their entire userbase to the IRS. As far as Groinbase is concerned for tax purpose if you transfer your coins out that's a taxable event. That's like moving your fiat from one account to another. YOu don't pay taxes for that, but Groinbase don't give no fuck.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:54:00
Exactly. It is a great currency though. I've been paying people and accepting it for a couple of years now on a regular basis. I love it. But now that its going to tack on another 5-10$ on each transaction I say fuck it.

too late. ACH/coinbase....might have to move it away to an offshore wallet and leave a little in the personal wallet to show as "see its only got 1200 bucks". But the legal implications if they could prove otherwise might land you in jail. I don't know.

It depends on what you're buying. It will hit the blockchain almost immediately it just won't confirm for awhile depending on your fee. I never wait for a confirmation unless its a large amount.
If you're buying a cup of coffee there's no reason to wait for a confirmation. If you're buying a house. Wait for 6.

I agree with you. I have holdings in both ETH and BTC. But if I were to pick only one it would still be BTC. These scaling problems will eventually be resolved. Hopefully soon. Something is about to change I feel like. I've been watching bitcoin since it was only $1. I bought in at $4. The biggest problem I see right now is that its started to suck as a currency with these extremely high fees. I am living off it for some of my expenses and have a small percentage of my income from it. I always derived pleasure in using Bitcoin as a currency because I fucking hate the system. Blame Rage, Bad Religion and all those punk bands I listened to in the 90s I guess. :)

@_date: 2017-06-20 04:40:55
bummer. nm
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:27:34
i used a l33t h4ck3r name generator because everything else was taken. ixtillion &lt;-- that is just a bunch of random shit. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 06:21:36
i don't know what you're asking anymore. sorry.
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:51:15
Use jaxx or electrum. Simply transfer them to your personal wallet. Make sure you absolutely 100% backup your seedphrase. Otherwise you're fucked if you lose that (no joke).
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:59:48
I have not used it but LocalBitcoin meets that criteria. I would but I'm somewhat afriad someone will nab me for money laundering or something. I don' treally know the precautions
@_date: 2017-06-24 06:08:43
I don't even remember typing it. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:35:58
we need more cipher punks in here.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:57:26
yes you're too late. it will never go beyond this point again. I have magic elves that I use as prediction slaves for the bitcoin markets...they tell me for sure its over.
now, if you want some sound advice don't blow your wad all at once. Buy a little bit each week over the course of a year and you'll be in a good position. Hold for 10 years.
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:29:33
Pffft.....solar powered bitcoin mining rig. How dumb does that sound???
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:54:38
its not going to be worth anything after august 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:01:28
i'm not sending you random nodes. we just met
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:00:26
Don't bother with BitMessage then.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:36:41
not with that stupid title you aren't. now you are just trying to prove you have street cred because you cant' change your idiotic title. Don't blame it on me dog.
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:36:17
yeah. that's what i'm telling you. that link was a non-op.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:39:04
i dont' get it
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:22:38
Jesus fucking christ. WHAT FUCKING COUNTRY DO YOU LIVE IN?
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:55:01
link to source? That's not what I've been reading but there's all kinds of FUD out there. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:40:08
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:48:25
Sent. What do I do now?
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:53:01
10 or so
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:54:07
Its going to take time to happen before it happens again.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:24:32
Let me tell you something that took me 12 years of pain and suffering to learn: Don't ever tell a woman you have that BTC. When she breaks your heart she'll take that too.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:56:45
I just threw a pinecone at a squirrel. Little bitch just ran away. I'm ready baby. Bring it on!
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:38:48
that's not really proof of anything. All they can prove is that on specific dates I bought $x amount of bitcoin on coinbase. Then I transferred it out. Who knows where it is now
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:56:36
sure it does. I see transactions on blockchain.info immediately within seconds as soon as I send them (0 confirmations).
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:53:33
its all out of coinbase. my friend only buys there, then he transfer to personal wallet. He could just setup another one and keep the seedphrase in his brains. The real implication here is if they can prove you are lying then you might actually be fucked. Jail/perjury fucked.
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:10:02
stfu millennial.
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:02:24
bunch of toddlers can't decide on a path forward would be my guess.
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:36:38
but before too late...and only after just in time.
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:17:21
Not true. Bitcoin has crashed many times in its 9 year history. It will continue to crash. Its not worth anything at this point. Thanks to Larry Silbert and Joe Montana.
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:18:35
I know for a fact it will go up or down prior to and/or after august 1st. please plan accordingly.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:10:22
Its pointless as a currency now. Which will mean its going to implode soon. We basically are all holding pet rocks at this point.
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:33:06
tldr: there's a better shitcoin! lol

Groinbase: "Whenever there's a dip, we kick you in the Groinbase."
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:46:37
Yessir....*if* you think Bitcoin will survive August 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:01:08
My advice to you is to only invest what you can afford to lose. Let's say for you that is $80/month. 
Buy $10 amounts twice a week. You can try to time it but I've learned to just do market orders. Over time you will build up a nice little stash.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:10:54


oh shit. I had not thought of that.
@_date: 2017-06-23 07:27:46
its a nice looking site though....
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:15:31
goxxening of groinbase in progress....stay tuned!
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:41:01
Anyone else besides me automatically dismiss any Bitcoin article that uses that stupid fucking gold coin photo?
edit: they have the "Hooded hacker(tm)" photo in the article too. rolls eyes :(
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:30:06
well its somewhere. its not confirmed. if not the blockchain then where is it?
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:12:37
i see
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:18:34
this can all be blamed on the agile development process.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:39:56
anyone who has trading experience and knows about CY vs. FY should also know wtf dollar cost averaging is.
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:55:22
no way.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:00:55
The only time I've had failed transactions is when they didn't show up right away.
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:41:12
teh colored areas.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:14:29
CY17? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:37:04
None of these are the real price. CoinBase still at $2961
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:22:47
i don't much beyond basic usability.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:44:02
i create a new account every year or so.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:53:31
what is the point of a wallet if you have to worry about inputs?
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:41:26
hilarious. nice to meet you old timer.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:41:00
I don't undrestand.
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:18:32
That's a good strategy. Typically what I mean by "don't put it in what you can't afford to lose" is directed at those who want to put their life savings into bitcoin. This shit could all go south tomorrow due to some unknown flaw. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:15:13
are there any other airlines you can pay with btc? I thought Virgin did awhile back but I don't know if they still do.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:58:17
Dude was sharing an account with a friend. One of you two got hacked or your "friend" screwed you bro.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:10:47
works fine for me.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:48:26
It basically means Blockstream won.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:49:15
why would you want to start a new wallet periodically?
@_date: 2017-06-23 07:24:28
goxification of poloniex.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:58:41
Yeah it sounds like you're doing a lot of extra work to avoid a few bucks. Not something I'm willing to waste my time on. I'll just wait until august 1.
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:13:35
yup. isn't this what tainted coins are? or is that something else.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:01:05
i would buy small amounts frequently.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:47:47
Why not both?
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:59:09
I don't know 100% but from my understanding as long as you hold BTC before then the worst that could happen is you have X btc on each chain if there is a fork.
@_date: 2017-06-23 07:33:37
How do I pay???? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:52:55
i have no idea. its always worked for me w/o making any changes. ask in @_date: 2017-06-20 03:23:21
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:48:39
Not anymore. I agree with that. Unless you're getting a truly specialized degree. It's simply not worth it anymore for standard degrees.
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:37:48
When I need a quote I usually just use preev.com 
I use bitcoinwisdom if I want to follow the price closely. Beyond that I have a toolbar app on my mac called Coin Tick.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:58:58
Just look up "groinbase irs" it was about 9 months ago.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:50:32
You're wrong. I looked at your post history. Sock puppet.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:52:48
Epic reddit comment. "I didn't read the article...." lol "edit: ok, i read the article". ROFL
I disagree with your assertion. What you describe, right place right time is what happens when you win the lottery. This kid at least had enough foresight to see the implications of Bitcoin and hold it. He got out at the first top ($1200) -- and started another "company" that he later sold for $60k. Most adults can't even come close to this.
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:39:29
No it isn't. You should never store your holdings on an exchange. But as far as disabling  your account Groinbase has proven over and over again they will do this whenever they feel like it.
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:42:07
i thought that was fungible. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:10:42
That is a beautiful quote.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:00:51
interns maybe. real engineers only eat Tillamook slices of cheese.
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:52:26
you must be new here. fee used to be a fraction of a penny. nobody is going to use this piece of shit currency.
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:51:53
I've heard not to use Copay. I heard Electrum is committed to both chains after a fork, so if I were you i'd move them all to electrum.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:41:48
no. you just sound like a jackass.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:45:53
Most people can't even pick a good password which would solve 99% of their problems...and here OP is telling them to replace their bios. smh.

WHo said I was giving up? I'm riding this bitch into the ground or to the moon, whichever comes first. I was there for bitcoin's Operation Desert Storm.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:36:59
naah. i have some but not enough to be considered "rich"
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:00:01
Also, never tell *anyone* you have btc. Just keep that shit to yourself. Just act as though you robbed a bank to get it and are sitting on a pile of cash.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:39:03
uh no.
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:44:35
Electrum will support both forks if there is one. Make sure you wallet provider will as well like Armory.
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:20:11
bip all the things! most miners and some users are starting to signal for bip92
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:07:10
altcoins always in carnage. what else is new?
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:08:55
Yeah. That's why I said I'll simply wait until the shit is fixed. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:00:06
It is doomed. If it can't be transacted with then  you really have nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:14:31
dfuq is PBOC?
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:56:21
I copy it into a file and encrypt the file with a password I know I won't forget and then I back that up in several locations.
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:52:06
that is probably the most common excuse lawyers get. I'm sure they have a response to that that you haven't thought of.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:26:44
jesus christ. you couldn't just say 2017 for fucks sake?
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:45:25
you keep proving my point.
@_date: 2017-06-26 05:04:06
I usually lose money on shitcoins. I have some RubyCoin somewhere. Trying to figure out where.
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:42:25
more gold coin articles.
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:29:39
well then they are brand new. This was all over the place here when it happened. Good post none-the-less. Didn't mean to be a downer. I'm amazed at how many people don't understand privacy or anonymity.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:20:12
Funny, I had this problem with Gemini. Still can't connect a bank. Which is why I still use Groinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:25:50
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:03:58
How do you not always pay the exact amount with btc?
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:35:51
Sure. I guess. YOu drew them, not me.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:36:35
nothing. if bots can take over they can do it here too.

Are you saying you can't just lock engineers in a room and slide pizza under the door to solve problems? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:37:43
bitcoin is the cash here smart guy.

oh you got me there :P

old news. stop using groinbase if you don't want to pay taxes on  your gains.
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:44:27
That's what the wallet calculated. I have it set to "medium".
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:58:16
