It can, but the question is what would 1 billion usd get you?! A banana? A house?  
Quoting an exchange rate means nothing by itself.

This is a great argument for people who bought more than 3 months ago.  
Those who got on board above 10k can’t really find comfort in those words tho!

We both know that most of the newbies put in money they are not ready to lose. Everyone and their dog has been buying bitcoing because they want the quick short term profit...

It is. But who is to say the music will stop? If you don’t believe bitcoin will be around for a long time, then maybe don’t put more than play money in it.  
Bitcoin is special and it is perfectly possible that it will be around for a looooong time. If it cements it’s place as a currency or store of value or a mix of those, and it will be adopted by a big number of people, then it will be even less likely to go away.  
There is obviously quite a bit risk in bitcoin. Especially when it comes to it’s price. But if you treat it like a penny stock, then you don’t have much to lose.

I don’t think the difference between a bubble popping and a big correction is percentages only.  
It’s more about whether it will go back up soon after or it will stay low for extended periods...
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:18:49
Don’t they offer credit card transactions? I don’t use them, so just guessing based on other exchanges.  
Usially the fee is steep (some exchanges are 5%), but if you really want to buy now, that’s a solution.

Haha OP saw the orange arrow and didnt even bother reading even the title leg alone the article XD
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:14:22
Yea but that is the same with everyhing that you buy to sell later. This is why so many people lost so much during the 2008 financial crisis...

You managed to cut off the past 24 hours when it went back up to 15k???

Well, if you are only making an analysis based on 1 exchange, you don’t have the big picture do you? I mean bitstamp’s support will not stop other exchanges to fall below it’s support, and then bitstamp will shortly follow too. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:45:18
Why would you convince someone to do that tho? If something goes wrong, you’ll have to take part of the blane! Do you want that?

As far as i have read, The story didnt go that way. One guy wanted to buy pizza with bitcoin so he paid another guy to buy it with FIAT. So the shop didnt see any of the bitcoin.  
If this is how it actually happened...  
edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:22:49
Oh boy! That was exactly my point and You completely missed it, haha.  
So you make a completely misleadinng post, then when i point this out, you try to tell me i got it wrong? Read my post again.  
You also just corrected your original comment by the way. You just proved that you can’t compare the 1000% gains to the 40% loss because the base number of those percentages is 100 times apart!!!  So the 40% loss equals 400% when you base it on the original number.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:57:55
The extra 1k is invested by the buyer yes. Will he eventually lose on it? If he sells at a lower price that 16k, he will lose money.  
I have a feeling you are trying to figure out if this is a ponzi scheme. And the answer is not. This will happen to you with stocks or property also...
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:09:40
I agree. I just addressed OP’s point about the historical price...
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:26:10
13.25k , 13.6k is the same shit when the price fell from 19k... biiiitch
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:50:38
So this shows that the current price is way to high?! Got it, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:28:07
Ah i didnt realise you werent OP. Yeah we are saying the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:46:33

@_date: 2017-12-23 15:38:06
Maybe, maybe not. Nobody knows!!!
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:55:59
Well said!!
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:23:51
That number by itself means nothing as people make a lot more these days than 100 years ago.  
The current world economy is based on FIAT and it’s inflationary characteristics. We live in a consumer society and for a deflationary currency to be able to replace FIAT completely , there would need to be a paradigm shit in how the world economy works. This shift would not be going smooth by the way. Probably a big portion of the world’s population would suffer a lot more than even now.  
It can however co-exist with FIAT wihout causing all that economic chaos.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:48:17
you probably got all your bitcoin at a much lower average cost than what it is right now. Correct? Most people would not worry in your case either to be honest. If you got in above 15k, the situation would be quite different i guess.

Well, he says it was 1000 in 2015, but in reality was below 500 the whole year. So you can stop reading it...
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:21:44
Do you even math bro? So are you saying that btc is still on 960% gains in that period then?  
Give me your bitcoin, i’ll give you 100% gains, after which i’ll take a 70% loss. You should be happy with the outcome ;)
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:54:06
You got hacked, bitcoin is gone. Easy!
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:58:36
This doesnt help if you bought above 14k. And many did, so there are many nervous people out there...

Obviously the USD was the reference when they came up with the decimal numeral system. Gonna go check the white paper and prove it to you. Brb...  
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:07:07
Well, lets say you buy 10 bitcoin with fiat. Then you trade with alt coins, and end up with 20. If ypu want to cash out, you have to prove at what price you got them at no? But you cant provide that for your 10 bitcoin from trading. So what are you gonna tell them?

@_date: 2017-11-27 19:54:12
Jeeez. Enjoy man!  
What’s with some of the comments here? People just can’t take it when someone has a different opinion than “the price will be 100k soon”.  
If you can get 3.2m now and retire, why wouldnt you? Maybe i would have kept 100, but i can understand it if someone wants to sell all of it.

Really? What bank was it? I havent heard anyone have problems with bitoasis.  
Also, he said there are only 5 banks in his country and there is only one othere reliable one. That cant be the UAE...
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:00:39
Where would all that money come from? 16m bitcoin at 100m per bitcoin gives a stupidly high number that is definitely not gonna happen.  
The price has been skyrocketing this year because nobody is selling and everyone and their dog is buying. (Exagerrating obviously).  
Sure it can still keep going, but it will not keep going up at this rate for years for sure...
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:07:27
Well, he is right that the Banks and governments are not gonna go down without a fight!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:20:14

@_date: 2017-11-30 16:20:28
Dude, nobody knows where the peaks and bottoms will be, so stop pretending you know. Can it go down from here? Sure. How much and for how long before it starts going up again? We’ll see. And Even If your prediction turns out to be correct, it still only will have been a lucky guess. This is Like standing next to a roulette table and predicting it will be red. Are you gonna say ‘i told you so’ after? Come on!
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:01:54
There is nothing wrong with the hodlers IMO. (You will not find posts or comments like that from me tho) They are in it for the long run and not for quick profits. They have also seen many people get burnt by trying to day trade. Their advice to hodl is mostly genuine encouragement for the newbies or even just to each other i guess. They are not here to do a pyramid scheme. If bitcoin will remain the number one crypto, it will have paid off to be in it early and hold.  
Back to your post, Maybe if you put in a bit more effort into your post, you would have gotten different comments. You basically just thew 2 numbere out there.
