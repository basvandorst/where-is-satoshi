Get over it. Miners have just as much a right to the cards as gamers/pc enthusiasts do.

@_date: 2017-08-17 03:42:27
Yeah please plummet so I can buy a lot more
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:55:05
This is coming from someone who has not used the service but I believe you use a short term escrow type service and deposit the funds to the seller that way. Not actually sure if they have to actually be local to you or what the fees are like

You got some BBQ coin for me?
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:38:25

Who said I didn't?  They haven't got back to me yet which has me feeling kind of nervous. Just wondering if anybody else had experienced any of these issues in the past.
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:13:22
Id like to have it, dad
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:58:06
Why don't you go to their website and research the fees and how to use the service.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:03:30
I'll do the same
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:41:45
The high prices have me stressed out though. FOMO is real ��
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:36:17
Glad to hear it
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:55:21
Not yet I've been trying every hour or so today
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:34:50
Follow your dreams dad

@_date: 2017-08-16 02:25:51
Hope everything is ok :)
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:06:57
By far the worst definitely I've ever seen good job 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:47:30
Tried to send to my address on bittrex but got notification: failed to send, something went wrong
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:14:16
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:27:52
To my house lol
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:10:55
I could see that as a possible time line
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:52:23
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:30:06
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:22:47
Why did you post this here?
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:24:22
He's making fun of bigger block sizes 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:21:25
I thought you were saying health juice like kale and apples
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:04:24
Will do!
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:57:00
I just signed up with coinbase commerce. There are more technical options available that i will be looking into in the next week or so
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:57:37
Those are two of my faves
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:39:17
I havent ever tried it personally so id hate to tell you yes and leave you disappointed.  We have a number of good bakery flavors though!
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:28:39
I saw another business owner post to this sub a week or so ago saying they had somehow integrated lightning to their payments for their site. A little over my head at the moment but will be researching more soon.

@_date: 2018-03-30 21:53:59
I would guess people who are interested in both bitcoin and vaping? I dont need the advertising, 2 people ordering from us isnt going to affect our business in any way
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:42:27
Ask your local shops if they accept bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:42:29
For now we only manufacture and sell the liquid
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:12:52
There are?!
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:52:48
Oh what I never thought he ever did anything else ever! I'm just saying average people tend to lend too much faith/weight on the words of people like mark Cuban or any other successful investor/business person.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:54:17
Agree to disagree. To think that you couldn't come up with something as useful or innovative is only hurting yourself. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:00:45
Correct. It's the circumstances that bring you to the realization that there is a hole in the market that is the lucky part
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:59:07
Thanks for the support friend!
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:39:06
I'm not saying he didn't, he obviously did. What I'm saying is there's nothing special about him inherently that led him to having that idea, just a series of fourtnate events in his life that brought him there.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:16:55
We make e liquid for electronic cigarettes!
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:37:16
So now we are comparing the invention of the wheel to Mark Cuban? You are taking what I said "people underestimate the role of luck in success" and turning it into "every invention is the result of luck"
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:36:47
I will check it out thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:17:04
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:13:40
People tend to grossly underestimate the role of luck in situations where people like mark Cuban become extremely wealthy. Sure he had a marketable idea with his sports broadcasting thing he sold to Yahoo but anybody is capable of having an idea like that.

@_date: 2018-04-18 14:26:17
That's ridiculous.  I would tell your buddies to consider  re evaluating their processes. I have 2 BTM machines charge 8.5% and am able to pocket close to 5%. Assuming they don't have lots of machines or are going through a lot of growing pains, I just can't see 2 or 3 per cent off 15.
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:55:55
I heard this this morning as well! In San Diego, talk about predatory lending
