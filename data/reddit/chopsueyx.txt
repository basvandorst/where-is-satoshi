Watch me expose this puppet along with his friends shortly. Roger Ver, I'll show you how to insult someone on the internet and how your money can only fit in your a-hole and do nothing about it.

If you want to save some money, I'd recommend booking travel through the user livinglarge on the underground marketplace Agora. He's the biggest travel vendor and I personally used him, check my posts.

Seriously some people here are so ignorant. I am serious, I don't know him in that way, it's not even a "friend" relationship. He owns a lot of businesses and I found out early he was into bitcoin, he even showed me his exchange accounts there is minimum hundreds of thousands of euro being sold at once. This was a screen shot from years ago though, everything he has told me I have reason to believe he is either the one who took the money, or he is involved in it. You don't need half a brain to know that Bitfinex was not hacked, it was a inside job. That's why I don't contact them, I can't contact europol either because it says on their website a police report has to be made. Doing it that way is going to take months before something is done. 
I am 100% serious I need advise what to do.

How did this thread get so much attention? McAfee basically fuck sluts, kids, kill them, repeat. Also supports ICO scams, and charges your yearly salary for tweets. He's not too different from Donald Trump.

Yeah it was until someone came along and invented ETH which basically gave everyone the option to be the main character from wolf of wallstreet. Banks made bitcoin btw.
