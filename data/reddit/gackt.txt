There's not a single place in the whole of my country, where I could go and give someone money and be handed one of those financial products.
I would have to pay air/land fare to a neighbouring country to do such (and I probably would be charged too for the purchase of the financial products, and they probably have a minimum investment larger than $100).
Meanwhile I can go to localbitcoins and wire money to a local account and receive bitcoin in exchanges in minutes.

Don't feel too bad, it's going to hit $10k in less than 5 years so buy more now!

non-shower thought: Certain countries kinda let you in with their artifically low inflation rates. And other countries just fuck you up your ass with no lube like Zimbawe and Venezuela.
Will 1st world countries actually ever see hyperinflation episodes like in the aforementioned countries?

I'd argue that in the case of bitcoin, as opossed to fiat or gold, it's actually kinda better than goods or property.
I live in a country where you can buy a house for like $2000, whereas they were tens of thousands of dollars before. All of this because a dictatorship took hold of the country, fucked it up and property prices super-crashed, of course the fiat also crashed.
If your wealth had been in USD (in banks abroad) you would have been safe, however what if something similar happens in the USA, the USD will crash. (I know USD is an special case because of the petro-dollars Saudi Arabia deal thing, just used it as an example).

IF I MAKE A BANK TRANSFER TO YOUR NAME FOR 30000 BOLIVARES AND IN EXCHANGE YOU GIVE ME A  $1 US DOLLAR PHYSICAL BILL IN CASH AKA A GREENBACK AKA A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS "ONE DOLLAR" IN IT THAT'S NOT LONGER ILLEGAL. Hell I'm now kinda remembering if it ever was.


However I'm pretty sure this was illegal and it's not longer such. You think that's true when Newspapers are able to publish the free / black market / dolartoday / cucuta / al lado de la asamblea / maicao exchange rate, daily as in every single day since they made the changes to the law.
Again I'm talking about 2 private individuals, no company / enterprise / cooperativa / LLC / trust / etc.

I'm Venezuelan. Since dollars have become a bit scarce and expensive. And you can pretty much only buy like $10 at a time (unless you go to the border with Colombia but the trip can be expensive) I'm actually buying cigarrettes just to keep my fucking savings.

Venezuelan here. USD cash was never illegal to hold.
And actually in some kind of glimpse of sanity a few years back they made it legal to exchange privately at any price you want. But only private individuals. Not companies (of course some companies have loopholes and what not).
Of course holding USD cash opens you to extortion by police / military.
And they only way to routinely exchange bolivares is traveling to the border to Colombia (and in some places in Venezuela but at a higher price than in Colombia but hey you're saving on the trip though).

I said privately, as in private transactions between 2 natural persons. 




Unless they feel like applying eminent domain right there and then. But I digress.
