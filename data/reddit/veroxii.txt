Something that trips up a lot of newcomers to bitcoin is that your money isn't actually stored **in** your wallet software. At first glance it might seem that way, because you open the wallet app and there is your money and you can send and receive coins.
However all that is important is what is in the blockchain - the distributed peer-to-peer public ledger which tracks which addresses contain which bitcoins.
Your wallet app simply interacts with this peer-to-peer network.
Now here's the really cool part. A bitcoin wallet address is just a made-up number. A REALLY BIG number. No, even bigger than that! :-)
And that's it. You can make up a new bitcoin address by simply picking a random number which no-one else is using, and it's unlikely anyone is. This is how offline wallets work. You just pick a big random number (or private key as we call it) and then that's your new wallet.
There's obviously a little bit more to it - there's a second number which is your public key, but the point here is that it's important to understand that no-one assigns bitcoin addresses or keeps track of them. You (or your wallet software) simply make it up.
And this is why an offline or paper wallet is possible and secure - you create an address on a computer which has never been connected to the internet. And if you send money to it, the blockchain will keep track of it. You can even check the balance on blockchain.info even if your wallet is just a printout of a random number on a piece of paper.
How cool is that? :-)

I've transferred from NAB to coinjar and have it take more than a week. Then I tried to transfer from NAB straight to bitstamp overseas. Cleared in 6 hours.
So fuck coinjar - just use bitstamp directly. Coinjar's price is artifically inflated too. They say it's 2%, but that's 2% above their "ask" price, which is 1% above spot, and their spot is just some random made up number which is always higher than every other exchange out there if you convert it to AUD.
So again, fuck coinjar.

Do you know what the volume on Gox itself was? If I recall they were still doing more volume than Stamp at the time. I ask because one of the theories I've read in the original Willy thread is that Gox might've been buying with these accounts to turn their USD commissions into bitcoins.
They might simply have been "maintenance bots". The volume seems to be a little too much for this to be completely true, but if we consider the amount of USD Gox earned from commissions on the huge volumes during the boom, it might offset the impact even more.

Just because you say you're not providing financial services, doesn't mean you aren't. It's solely up to whoever is in charge to be the judge of that. And if they think that you were, then not only do you have KYC issues, but you were also afoul of not being properly registered.
It will probably come down to if the volume of transactions you were doing can be "reasonably" seen as a private individual, or as a business.

Most people would agree South African style jerky ("biltong" and "drywors") are some of the best out there. Australia doesn't really have a jerky tradition, but with so many South Africans now living here (in Aus) there are more and more places making and selling it. Jim's Jerky seems to be in this category. On their site they even say they bought the business from a South African couple.
It was also interesting that they make a distinction between "jerky" and "biltong", which is sometimes used interchangeably.

I'm as mad as you too. But why are you looking for other people to fix it for you. You have the solution already. Spend that 25 BTC on mining. DIY, or get someone to manage it for you, or buy into one of the mining contracts which compete with CEX like PETAmine.
After lying awake thinking about this all night, I've come to the conclusion that it is us, the holders of bitcoin who need to take control. And that requires action.
Satoshi talked about all actors being financially rational - not financially altruistic. Isn't it financially rational for us bitcoin holders to "invest" in the future of our beloved bitcoin? What % of your holdings are you willing to put into mining to protect the rest? If you're not, then why should anyone else?

@_date: 2014-06-14 00:37:15
You are exactly right.
Effectively cloud mining gives us the ability to do "proof of stake", since they sell mining power for BTC, and the more BTC you have the more units you can purchase and invest in.
So it's time for all the bitcoin investors to pony up and put a percentage of their holdings into mining operations. I've now committed to keep at least 1% of my BTC-worth in mining contracts of some kind.
If you're a bitcoin hodlr, but don't have any mining exposure, then you're part of the problem. Let's stop being part of the problem, and be part of the solution!

Yes - what sshatwork said. If a thief hacked into someone's online banking and made a payment to you, the bank is simply going to take the money back once the legitimate owner realizes and complains. It is their money and they didn't authorize the transfer.
KYC comes into it that if you had that person send you a photo of themselves, or scans of their identity which reasonably only the real account owner would have had access too, then you can dispute his claims of being hacked because you have prove that it was really him who did the transaction with you.
This is why so many of the bitcoin sellers in Australia only deal with cash deposits and not bank transfers. Because a thief can't fake having the cash and there's no-one to dispute the transfer later.

What is the risk of diners leaving a restaurant without paying? Or someone shoplifting? Same risk. And if you somehow pulled off a double spend attack for a measly $3 coffee they will do the same as with any other crime which happens in-store... report it to the cops.

Bad idea for the core of the bitcoin network.

Also, we're only getting half the story here. Maybe OP is behind on taxes? I know a few countries where if you already owe the tax office they can garnish it from your bank accounts at any time.

Also remember that you joining p2pool would improve the variance etc over time.

Yes, but if I own those shares I'm in control of what I do with my dividends and more importantly I get some voting rights and control over what happens with all the hashing power.
From my perspective the surest way to make sure PETA mine remains a good actor is to control PETA mine.
Also with my dividends I'll reinvest in even more mining related endeavours - such as their next IPO or further projects, or some of their competitors. I'd rather do this than have the get-rich-quick guys cash out all mining profits immediately instead of keeping it in the bitcoin ecosphere. Hell, just hodling my dividends for the long term would be a good thing.
It's about us bitcoins stakeholders, taking control of the mining. (and who said bitcoin wasn't "proof of stake"?) ;-)

Yes and no. :-)
Difficulty changes so that confirmation times stay roughly constant at 10 minutes per confirmation.
But if difficulty is increasing, it means that maybe confirmation times have dropped to 8 or 9 minutes - so yes it will become longer again to get back to 10 minutes.
If for some reason confirmation times become longer (let's say a bunch of miners turn their machines off), then difficulty will decrease to bring it back to 10 minutes.
tl;dr the system keeps adjusting difficulty so that confirmation times stay approximately 10 minutes.
edit: nice graph showing historic confirmation times -

I think he phrased it poorly. We simply allow the system accept transactions with more decimal precision. 
If you had 1 bitcoin before you will still have 1 bitcoin. I can just now send you a ten trillionth of a coin instead of one trillionth. But 1btc is still 1btc.
The idea is that such a small fraction of a coin will actually be worth something, like a big mac or whatever.

And all the armchair network engineers were pointing out the stupidity of not controlling your own hardware end to end.
That theft was more than 40k coins if I recall. Albeit at much lower exchange rate.

I agree with bob... this is the killer function for bitpay and coinbase. Integrating a bitcoin shopping cart is not what attracted Dell to coinbase. It was the instant conversion to fiat. Merchants aren't in the business of currency price speculation, especially when margins are slim.
My honest opinion as a business owner... if you can't convert to fiat you will have very few users. If you add integration to exchanges you will seriously compete with the big boys.

That's not true. Key your wallet provider know you're going to take your business elsewhere if their backend nodes don't support the new version. There will be plenty of alternate hosts happy to take your business. Maybe a 'Powered by XT' logo for businesses could help with this?

Again you don't. But you know who they are and what their reputation is etc. If you really want to secure millions source your own ARM chip and get someone you trust to build your own PCB etc. Then get some security professionals to independently audit the Trezor code base.

And you're probably still safer to just use an m of n paper wallet for such large amounts. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:45:01
I agree this is the killer function needed. Merchants use coinbase because of the instant conversion. If you allow plugins someone (or you) can code up something to interface via the Bitstamp API and do a hedge sell and even transfer coins to the exchange. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:32:01
This is the right answer. It allows the exchange to implement all these extra policies. The bitstamp theft involved large transactions with abnormally high fees (presumably to encourage miners). This could easily have been blocked by a trivially simple co signing policy.

Gavin has stated many times that he is happy to pick a different solution as long as *something* is picked and the block limit issue addressed. So out if all the current BIPS which one is your choice? Or if none what is your solution? (and this goes for all the core devs)
It's the inaction and unwillingness to commit to something which frustrated Gavin (and by proxy the community).
So the current solutions (XT and status quo) are probably the most extreme of the choices, but I think it forces the devs to come up with something in between. At least we're covered for either eventuality of nothing happens or the blockchain grinds to a halt and people switch to XT as a failsafe.

Bitcoin is too volatile at the moment. In the real world any legit investment that is not a ponzi scheme will still only pay 20 to 50% per year. If it's a guaranteed fixed interest probably less.
But currently bitcoin's price can change more than that in a single day! Who is going to risk that? Especially if the price drops and now they owe you interest plus the loss.
This is the same reason people have failed with bitcoin loan businesses too plus the incredible risk of fraud with a pseudononymous non reversible currency.

Like this article, people keep saying Bitpay isn't really part of the Bitcoin economy. They are just selling the coins right away for evil fiat.
But these people forget that for every SELL there is a corresponding BUY. So when Bitpay "dumps" those coins, it means there is a constant supply of coins available on the markets for normal people to buy. Better liquidity is usually seen as a good thing, isn't it?
That it takes a Tesla to get an early adopter to part with his coins and sell them to new adopters is irrelevant. Essentially the new person trying to get into bitcoin went and bought a Tesla with their fiat, gave the Tesla to the bitcoinaire, and took bitcoins in return.
To me I don't see the bad here. It's adding velocity to the bitcoin economy, adding liquidity to the markets, and making hoarders part with some of their coins. Think of Bitpay as a market maker.

Also, I think it would be good if brick and mortar bitcoin stores like this maybe provide a nice meeting room or something for localbitcoins.com users. Somewhere safe people can come and meet and swap their coins for cash without feeling dodgy about it.
Maybe charge a couple of bucks, but you get a free coffee or something. And regular sellers would build a reputation for being honest and "known". In fact, the store could probably sell coins on consignment with a small markup on others' behalf if they run out of their own coins to sell.

If the whole site runs in USD, does this mean that when I deposit my BTC it is immediately converted into USD? One of the current appeals of BTC is that it's generally appreciating in value (yes, I know it can go the other way too), but I'd prefer to have my bankroll sit in BTC while I'm asleep at night instead of USD.
So can you please talk a little bit about how BTC is handled internally on yours site? If at all possible I'd say a killer feature would be that you only convert from BTC to USD upon buying into a game or tournament, and your winnings get converted back to BTC once you leave.
But good product! I've always wondered why more poker sites didn't jump on bitcoin sooner. Good luck!

Exactly. Despite being hated by everyone, Paypal has got all the regulatory and licensing stuff sorted out. In the EU they are even registered as a bank. And other banks are cool with dealing with them. They also have years of experience in KYC and fraud detection etc.

Something to think about... if you were investing eg only 5 to 10% of your savings in bitcoins over the last 3 years, Bitcoin will now constitute pretty close to 100% of your net worth now because of it's incredible growth.
For instance, let's look at our Norwegian friend Kristoffer. In 2009 he invested $27. Maybe that was 1% or 10% of his net worth (he was a student after all). In late 2013 that was $885k. I'd wager constituting 99.99% of his net worth.

Get cash from your bank and deposit it into one of the few bitcoin selling companies' accounts over the counter. You get a quote locked at an exchange rate from their website and a deposit referral code to put on your cash deposit. Only cash over the counter deposits allowed to eliminate fraudulent transfers or charge backs. Most of them actually have accounts with all the major banks so unless you're with a really small credit union or something you don't even leave the building.
So yes you have to leave your house but essentially every bank branch in the country is now a bitcoin shop.
You get your coins sent to your address in a few hours... Sometimes a lot faster eg before you even make it back home.
Edit: forgot to say this method is essentially anonymous too because you don't need to show ID to deposit cash.

Nothing happens to them. They are no worse off than they would've been without bitcoin. Today if you travel from the USA to the UK you only get half the pounds for your dollars. Oh no! But a 4 dollar big mac only costs 2 pounds over there. Exchange rates may vary over time. But at the instant of exchange the purchasing power should be the same.
That's the whole point of exchange rates. It’s the markets deciding what the comparative purchasing power is.
Back to your example. In the distant future a big mac might only cost 1mBTC but it would cost $100 to buy in fiat in any case. So an exchange rate of $100 per mBTC in no way disadvantages anyone.
Yeap they lost out on growth opportunity. But they're no worse off than if bitcoin never existed.

Exactly. If you are rich in bitcoin, you will be able to convert some of your BTC into whatever alt starts gaining traction in the future.
eg. if you had a million USD worth of BTC today, you can trade if for a million USD worth of Litecoin. The exchange rate might fluctuate over time, but at the moment of exchange the real-world buying power should be the same.
So really there's no point to "invest" in litecoin now if all the momentum is behind bitcoin already.

Probably not. But from everything I've read, apart from being very closed, the Chinese banking system is very frictionless. Getting money into and out of exchanges is almost instant, 24/7.
So I think the "how to spend your BTC" problem will be solved with tools and browser plugins to "instant convert" BTC into RMB to facilitate your shopping and payments in China.
They will continue to use it as a speculative tool and as a store of wealth. And if it's incredibly easy to convert into fiat as needed then people will continue to use it as such.

I think people are getting too caught up in semantics here. Currency, commodity, money, medium of transfer, store of value - who cares?
This was the same with the China news on the weekend. When a government talks about "currency" they generally mean an official way for their government to transact in with it's citizens.
Can I buy a Tesla with my coins? Yes.
Can I buy a pizza? Yes.
Can I send money to a friend overseas? Yes.

My thoughts are that it doesn't matter. If new competitors start emerging, I'm quite sure you'll be able to move your bitcoin wealth fully or partially across.
Even right now, you can exchange Litecoins for Bitcoins, or Vice Versa.
And at the time of exchange your purchase power or value should be equivalent. That's the point of exchange rates. For instance if you became a bitcoin millionaire (when compared to USD), you will be able to exchange it for currency X's equivalent of $1,000,000.
So no point in worrying about it. Put your wealth in the vehicle you want, and if something better comes along then buy into it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:09:05
Exactly. One day we might see different alt coins all prosper and fill various niches. Maybe you use bitcoin for your long-term stable store of wealth. You use litecoin for your day-to-day stuff with amazingly high transaction throughput, etc.
And you simply exchange between them as you need them.

If you manually try and send money then you only have yourself to blame for this. The typical mistake is that if you send any money out of an address, anything left is by default assumed to be a fee!
You have to send the money you want to send, as well as the remainder to a "change" address.
Eg. if I have 2.0005 BTC and want to send 1 BTC with a .0005 BTC fee, then you need to send 1 BTC to the destination and 1 BTC to another address you control as your change. You leave 0.0005 BTC as the fee.
What typically happens in the graph is someone messes with a brain wallet and only send 1BTC out, leaving 1.0005 as a fee. And if it goes to a distributed pool such as that other recent unfortunate fellow, then your money is gone.
edit: the best solution is to import your brain wallet into a proper piece of software to manage all this for you before you want to spend anything.
@_date: 2013-11-29 10:14:29
Sell the private keys. But then the buyer would have to trust it's not being sold to more than one party or that the seller won't spend it. So if the buyer moves the coins to a new address the seller might just as well send it themselves.

This is kinda what the Winklevii are working on. A trust / ETF which is SEC approved and can be invested in by large institutional investors.

The thing I think people often miss is this:
Phase 1: speculation creates a lot of filthy rich people
Phase 2: merchants start accepting bitcoins, because there are a lot of filthy rich people just aching to cash in on their newly acquired wealth.
The speculation will result in the economy and utility growing.
Also, as others have said here, Bitcoin is not a zero-sum game. Very flawed logic there.

In the same way, banking in China is very frictionless - it's quick and easy to send money around and fund exchanges etc. 24/7 and is almost instant I've heard. If it's that quick and easy to turn your BTC into fiat, the "use as a payment system" aspect of bitcoin becomes less important than the store of wealth and speculation aspects.
In the USA, it's a pain and extremely slow to exchange between fiat and bitcoin, hence the emphasis to enable BTC payment for goods - to remove friction. And this is why Coinbase and Bitpay are doing so well.
I LOVE how bitcoin can be adapted to fill both these needs. Honey badger indeed.

They are probably right. I haven't used currencyfair to send money to bitstamp specifically. But I have used it to wire money overseas and it did have my name in there as the sender when it arrived.

If you go into a shop today and pay with a stolen credit card, or counterfeit cash, it's essentially a double spend as well. Happens all the time. In bitcoin there are no recorded events of double spending happening except for people testing it on purpose.
Not waiting for any confirmations and just doing a typical "shop-sized" transaction on faith is a lot safer and just as fast as current solutions. People blow this "wait for confirmations" thing way out of proportion.
Also, if someone does go and buy a sandwich at their local subway and pull a double spend (which they won't because it's expensive to pull off if at all), then you just handle it like a normal shop-lift. Report it to police and use your security camera footage to identify the perp.
For larger transactions such as buying a million dollar mansion, just wait the whole hour. This is still quicker than getting a bank cheque and waiting for that to clear which is the current process.

The HRMC comment said the 20% VAT is only on the service charge or profit portion. Like a voucher. So if you buy £100 worth of coins and the seller adds 2% margin. Then you'll pay 2.4% on top of the £100.
So stop being so dramatic. It's the same as when you buy gift cards, vouchers or silver.

What did you expect on such a big drop. Shorting isn't magic. In effect if you short, you are borrowing bitcoins from someone, and selling it. And you pay it back at some stage with interest/fees.
If EVERYONE is trying to short, then there isn't enough bitcoins to borrow to sell. What are they supposed to do? Loan you paper bitcoins which don't exist, like JP Morgan does with gold and silver?
I'd say that they are cancelling shorts in the market today means they are actually doing the right thing.

@_date: 2013-11-16 03:31:57
No. You think.
These banking problems just showcases exactly why centralizing is a problem. I think it's great and will simply expose the bankers for who they really are.
Just like the internet, bitcoin will route around these problems. I predict you'll start seeing more distributed solutions. For instance I think bitcoin.de is an exchange without fiat bank accounts. They simply let the buyers and sellers settle directly with each other. What, the banks are going to stop completely random private individuals from sending money to each other? They going to stop it in person with cash in hand?
Secondly, bitcoin is currently seen as more valuable than dollars. To get something desirable, people will always find a way. And there are people who will facilitate it. This is how black markets exist. Just this morning in another thread on here we read about how Russia wants to outlaw the buying of US Dollars. Same in Venezuela. Yet still people can buy it. People will find a way. Hell, it's as simple as taking a road-trip to Canada or Mexico.
Having to buy your bitcoins with fiat is only a stop-gap measure in any case. As the bitcoin community grows this loop is closed. If I get paid in bitcoin, and I can spend bitcoins, where do the banks come into it?
YOU are the bank. I am the bank. We're ALL the bank.
So again, how do you buy bitcoin if the banks won't allow you? Well, sell something for bitcoin. Or provide a service. The bitcoin economy is already large enough that you'll find people out there who have bitcoins and wants to buy something from you. The world is a big place. And a lot of bitcoins are already in US hands.
The cat's out the bag. No way is it going back in.
