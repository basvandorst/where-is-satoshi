You're a bigboi now!

I always knew there was a reason but couldn't quite put my finger on it.

Hmm. I'm guessing the "investment products" qualify to have the fees waved then? I'll have to see if that's possible with WF. Regardless, at least Gemini offers ACH.

I think I may actually be going with Gemini instead. They allow ACH, no fees on their end for wire transfer, and the limits are reasonable ($500/day; $15K/month). Interface is also nicer and more user friendly.

No, ACH or wire transfer only.

And after Circle checking out, they are supposed to be the go to exchange? Haha, gtfo.

Re: Kraken, SynapsePay incurs a $5 fee per transaction from them and whatever the domestic wire fee is from your bank. In my case it's **$30** (Wells Fargo). $35 per transaction regardless of amount is not appealing IMO but it's the only deposit option for US customers. Sure would be nice if they implement Credit/Debit and ACH at some point. I mean they are a US based company after all.

ZERO wire fees? Who do you bank with?
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:08:14
Just started with them. Only thing that sucks as a US resident is that the only way to deposit USD is via SynapsePay (Wire Transfer) which incurs a $5 fee from them and a **$30** fee from my bank (Well Fargo). Sure would be nice if they implemented Debit/Credit cards.

How long did it take to increase your limits to 10k with Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:30:25
I am doing minimum $500 at a time so Coinbase starting limits are bullshit. Just realized the same limits are applied when you deposit to USD wallet, so doesn't help me at all; they can go screw. Wire transfer times and fees seem to vary from bank to bank. One guy was telling me he has zero fees and same day transaction times with the three banks he has "investment accounts" with: BOA, Chase and Merril Lynch. Not sure of the validity to that but it's what he claimed. Wells Fargo says about 1-2 biz days, so I guess theoretically it could go through same day. Wire transfers are inconvenient though for regular use and with the fees, it's not feasible imo. I think I'm going with Gemini at this point. They offer ACH no fees, no fees for wire (on their end) and the limits are reasonable ($500/day, $15K/mo). Plus their interface is nicer and more user friendly, especially if you aren't going to be doing any serious trading.

They seem decent but the downside for US users is they only allow deposits via wire transfer, which incurs a $5 fee from them and whatever the fee is from your bank. Mine (Wells Fargo), is **$30** per transfer. So no matter the amount I am depositing, it's a $35 fee each time. Right now though, it seems to be my only option because Coinbase is garbage with its ridiculous starting limits. I came from Circle with $3K a week instant buy. With Coinbase, it's $50. GFY, Coinbase.

Would that be a way of getting around the insane SynapsePay (Wire Transfer) fees? In the US with Tier 3, the only way to deposit USD is via wire transfer which incurs a $5 fee from Kraken and a **$30** fee from my bank (Wells Fargo).

Since Circle dropped their exchange services, they are now touting Coinbase as their "preferred exchange". Thing that sucks though is I had a $3000 instant buy limit with them. Now with you guys, I have a **$50** instant buy limit. Some bullshit.
@_date: 2016-12-23 21:34:29
I was very happy with them. Had a $3K instant buy limit and never had any issues with my account. I go to buy some BTC the other day and find out what they did. I switched to them from Coinbase a while back but now it looks like it's *back* to Coinbase starting with a $50 instant buy limit. So pissed.

This. Andreas is extremely knowledgeable and has been in the game since the beginning. He is also quick to acknowledge that Bitcoin should not be regarded primarily as an investment tool.

For starters, [read the original Satoshi whitepaper]( It explains the technical aspects of how the blockchain functions and how the network operates. That is where the real value is anyways. There  are so many things blockchain tech can do, other than exchange currency.
