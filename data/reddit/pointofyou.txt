I'd say there are a couple of hundred million people, namely the workers and their families who'd disagree. But fuck them right? You do realize they're not just producing for the US right? If people in Kenya want t-shirts they buy them from India too. These low wage countries create their products for the world market, not just for your convenience.

Exactly. To many people having access to new technology is not just a matter of convenience or conspicuous consumption. Furthermore you'll never know of the implied opportunities lost due to you not having used the mobile phone. 
How did you learn about BTC? What if you'd not have bought a computer with the same line of thinking? Chances are, you might have missed BTC or become aware much later. 


That's great. For YOU. It's always nice to have options though right? I love whit t-shirts. Why would you wear a different color? It would also be easier to do business and make decisions if the only color t-shirt available was white. Yet, that doesn't justify me or anyone else constraining the choices of everybody else right? 
Same with money. By using a deflationary form you're adding uncertainty and thus creating an incentive to practice "defensive spending". Basically just spending on what's absolutely necessary... 


What? That's just not true. Salaries go up in concert with inflation. Of course the process isn't perfect or linear or uniform across all industries, sure, but by and large that's true. 


First of all that's just not true, average Joe was just as unable to purchase a house in NYC 100 years ago as he is now, and second of all the world was a different place 100 years ago and the value created in a town or city doesn't just disappear. 
Go to a place that's equally developed and you'll find comparable situations 


If you're focused on absolute numbers then you'll be fooled by this. Ask yourself, how many minutes or hours did the average person have to work for a Big Mac in '72 vs. today. I'm fairly certain it's become cheaper.

So I was able to find [this article]( stating 8.27 terawatt-hours per year for BTC, 11 terawatt-hours per year for fiat and 132 terawatt-hours per year for gold. 
I'll be the first to state that those numbers need to be double checked given the source isn't the most objective one.
To be honest though, I'm somewhat surprised the topic has received that much attention. It's not like we commonly discriminate how appropriate we deem the way people use electricity. 
There are far more obvious examples of goods &amp; services, that contra to cryptocurrencies are actually agree upon to be harmful, yet we don't discuss their energy consumption as a separate issue.

I'm a crypto enthusiast as well as somewhat versed in economics and would like to thank you for this. While I happen to agree with most of what you said, the more important point is that you made **reasoned arguments and for the most part avoided ad hominems or sarcasm**. 
If reddit is going to be a space for progressive discourse instead of an amalgam of echo chambers and meme-streams, this is the way to go.
I'd like to highlight out a couple of points you made that I thought to be particularly important:


**This cannot be overstated**. The irony is borderline painful. The crowd that's pushing the idea that BTC will replace fiat *sees their view validated by the increased fiat price of BTC*. If they were sincere they should be devastated not happy, as the rising fiat price of BTC should be interpreted as a substantiation of their criticism of fiat. But that's not the case. Instead they talk about all the lambos &amp; services they'll be able to purchase (with fiat mind you).


This needs to be acknowledged. Yes, there is a lot of unsubstantiated criticism that stems from not understanding how cryptos function, but there is also valid criticism which the crypto community is ignoring.


Regarding these points, I'm not sure I agree with those looking forward: 
- **Transaction fees** are high now (in fiat terms, which as you point out yourself is not really relevant in a crypto denominated world) but looking forward approaches such as proof of work will alleviate this.
- **energy usage due to mining**: I don't see this being valid criticism. I figure if we calculate the carbon footprint of the creation and distribution of physical money along with the energy consumed to keep track of it in databases etc, we would find that fiat uses more I believe. I found a value of 11 terrawatt-hours per year [quoted here]( Let's not even bother looking at gold or diamonds.
- **validation waits**: Sure, at this time you're completely correct, at least with BTC. Other cryptos can do a better job a this. Check out Ethereum as well as the Raiden Network ontop of it. Development is high, everybody realizes that this is the biggest issue.
- **Wallet protection**: While you're correct that handling cryptos is more risky than having a bank account I'd urge you to look at MPESA for example. It's a text message based virtual currency that has no cryptography (AFAIK) but facilitates around 60% of the GDP in Kenya (IIRC). So yes, putting people in charge of their own money introduces risks, but there are already good solutions out there (hard wallets, metamask to name two).
- **exchange with existing monetary infrastructure**: Not sure what you mean here, maybe you could clarify this point?

While I wouldn't word it as harshly I agree with your sentiment. Arguing here seems to be useless though.

Sure, but as opposed to what? It feels like we're arbitrarily imposing the question about the externalities of electricity production on this one instance of energy use. 
Wouldn't it make more sense to tally up the energy consumption of comparable forms of store of value? What do you reckon has a higher carbon footprint, crypto mining or actual mining for Gold for example? What about the hidden energy consumption of the banking system (the fraction that directly contributes to facilitating transactions)?
Crypto seems to be getting unfairly pointed out in this regard for the sole reason that the energy consumption is apparent, which isn't the case with the other forms I mentioned.

Your argument is misguided. You're essentially questioning if the price of electricity correctly reflects the possible long term ecological impact.
*What* the electricity is used for can't be the issue. Given the hundreds of billions in the market people obviously see a value in bitcoin which therefore justifies the usage of electricity.

Well, when was Gold/Silver last used as money and why did it stop? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:25:58


That's not what you said, now you're shifting the goalpost from:
*"A quick google check and the coins of my national currency are 50% silver"* to 
*"there are fiat coins in circulation that are made out of 50% silver"*. 
Furthermore the coins you linked to are worth more than their face value which is the reason nobody would use them and "in circulation" is reduced to a technical status.
Again, a rather disingenuous argument on your behalf. 


Ok, I'll glance over the fact that you continue that paragraph by refuting your own disingenuous point which I pointed out above. 
This is the precise reason why commodities such as gold, silver or BTC are a bad base for currency, it's not stable enough. 


So you just won't address the point I'm making will you? That's ok, I understand. You can't really.
Let's do this: quote me a price for 10 pounds of coffee in BTC which will be executed 1 year from now. **Here's the catch**; I get to decide which side of the deal I take based on the price ypu quote. 
You quote the price and I get to decide whether I want to buy 10 pounds of coffee from you for that price or sell it to you at that price. I have to pick one. 
Here, I'll do it in USD: $50. Easy. You can either buy 10 pounds of coffee for that price or sell them to me and I'll buy it in a year from today. Go ahead, pick one.
Time to put your crypto where your mouth is. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:00:34
"Generally in use" is about as vague as it gets and that's your best argument? You're debating semantics now.
I'll agree that I also don't see BTC being something I can use to purchase a coffee at Starbucks with, it's not that fungible (yet) and might never be. 
But it clearly represents an asset class similar to gold and as such a store of value. It's like a digital commodity. You can't deny that given how the market currently values it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:48:18
In that case the answer to the question would obviously be "no". The nature of the question is rather unsophisticated though as pretty much nobody ever questions their use of electricity based on the ecological impact. The reason people choose to take a bus/car over longer distances is often that it's cheaper, which also reflects the fuel requirements of an airplane along with the implied ecological impact.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:14:46


Why's that? For two reasons: 1. Because you can't make small enough units that can feasibly be traded and secured from forgery, shaving etc. 2. Because the value of gold fluctuates too much. 


Which one would that be? 




Logically speaking that sentence doesn't make sense. What are you saying, the coin is worth the coin? How would you measure the value? By the number printed on it? By its weight? Compared to what?
Yet you unknowingly get to the crux of the issue: the value of the coin fluctuates. This is a problem. If you're a business dealing with a currency that fluctuates is a big problem as it leads to price instability. 
If you're Starbucks and enter contracts to buy 50 tons of coffee in 6 months from now, how are you ever going to agree on a price given a strongly fluctuating currency? You need price stability in currencies to facilitate business. Gold/BTC can't.
Don't mistake my argument as being opposed to crypto though. I've been in for years now and am convinced it's here to stay. The tech is too strong. But the notion that a decentralized non government cryptocurrency will replace fiat is just not feasible. Businesses need a price stability to conduct business and governments won't give up their monopoly on money. Uncle Sam can dictate what currency you gotta pay your taxes in, thus having a monopoly on money.

As much as I miss him, this is a straw man argument. He posits that cryptography prevents government from preventing child porn/terrorism etc. Yet crypto is currently (and more so during his presidency) not a significant method of payment yet child port/terrorism still exist. Therefore government/law enforcement is incapable of preventing this despite having access to everything at the moment.
It's also a cheap shot tbh. Then again he had no trouble pushing the wage gap myth, so I'm not surprised really. The same argument was made against the internet in the early 90's. Technological innovations come with a trade off. It's the nature of things.

I'm a big crypto enthusiast myself, so don't mistake me for a hater. But I urge you to watch what you're wishing for. 
Assuming the scenario to occur in the near future (say within 5-10 years), the most likely scenario for BTC to hit $100K is if the USD turns to shit and devalues like a mofo. 
As shitty as you might think fractional reserve banking etc. is, fact of the matter is the USD is the reserve currency of the world. If it goes to shit blood will flow in the streets and a lot of people will die. I wouldn't want to be right about crypto that way...

@_date: 2017-09-27 17:04:22
The question you have to ask is what would prompt such a massive rise in the value of BTC? It couldn't come out of thin air, something would have to give right?
There has to be a reason for the market to ascribe the value to a certain asset, for example if we would discover a method to artificially create unlimited real gold, or, if the USD massively depreciated. In both those scenarios a lot of people would suffer/die.
I'm not saying that BTC can't ever reach that level, I believe it or another cryptocurrency will in the future. But if it's to happen in a somewhat sensible way that doesn't involve massive disruption then it's going to take much longer. Probably 20 years or so. And by that time the $100K figure will be more symbolic, as inflation will probably put it in the range of half of that at best in 2017 dollars.
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:54:42
