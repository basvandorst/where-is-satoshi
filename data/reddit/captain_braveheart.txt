What’s a ready press kit
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:04:21
How much did they make off it?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:54:15
You wouldn’t happen to have that on YouTube would you? 
It does help, I like the format!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:24
For sure. Any input to how I could respond to “why is it so popular?” 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:28:44
Where do you live now? 
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:29:20
Omg I love it
@_date: 2019-11-27 06:28:54
Wait and see what it’s worth in 10 years

I have them stored on my bitcoin.com wallet. As far as I can tell, no one can have access to them other than me ;). I was just unsure of the value of the bitcoin as the wallet is calculating its value using its "latest results". 
It's one of the many reasons I'm attracted to cryptocurrency. Don't have to deal with banks and the money is mine!

Bitcoin is getting Segwit in 9 days? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:49:28
That's..odd.  I'd like a wallet that has the bitcoin value equal to the current market rate. If you know of a wallet like that I'd love to know which it is. 
It seems because of my ignorance I purchased bitcoin at the market rate only to have it stored in a wallet that devalues it. Good learning experience :)

Thankyou for the clarification!
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:04:25
Do you know how? I don't understand how a cryptocurrency thats blockchain is constructed using traditional logic gates could adopt a quantum state bit. Wouldn't it need to be completely reworked from the ground up? I don't understand how that integration would work.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:43:35
That doesn’t make sense. Even if that were true the BTC I received should still be worth the same amount of USD that I traded in.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:50:55
This. Just because it worked out doesn't mean it was advisable or a smart thing to do.

If bitcoin hits $100,000,000 I’ll get a tattoo of Donald trump with the quote “no regrats” on my face.

@_date: 2017-11-09 21:12:02
Thanks! Fixed it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:23:28
You wouldn't happen to have a link to that would you.. I knew other people would've thought of it! Thats so cool! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:08:51
Maybe a quantum cryptocurrency would come about. Then I could buy it when its super cheap! It'd be like bitcoin all over again.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:47:11
That’s... a terrible idea. What genius came up with that idea?
Why try to keep the economy in the boom? If it’s failing that’s probably because the forces keeping it in motion can’t be sustained and need to be fixed.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:31:16
But inflation
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:13:46
That sounds incredibly short sited..
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:43:54
That sounds like a bad thing.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:32:15
How does quantitative easing work anyway
