Best advice yet, all the time when I’ve made my mind up about something I ask people what they think but I know I’ll do it anyway but this has really made me consider my decision �� and it breaks my heart because I put so much thought and hope into it and just by reading and OP advise I’m almost instantly convinced maybe it’s not the best thing to do
