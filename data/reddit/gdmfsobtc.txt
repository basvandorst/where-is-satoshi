In light of your minuscule 2 year time frame I think you should keep an open mind, given you call it 'investment'. If this is not an option, since your loss is causing you so much ongoing consternation, you should follow your first rule of getting out of denial, admit you fucked up, be a man, cut your losses and remain smug forever after as you watch Bitcoin slide into obsolescence. In the meantime for the rest of us Bitcoin  is a long roller coaster requiring a certain amount of intestinal fortitude and emotional detachment. I don't know how you managed to get on this ride and at the very very top, cause that in itself takes a significant amount of skill and luck, but this attraction is clearly not to your enjoyment.

You're right they most certainly are not low profit strategies.  
If you thought that Google was getting out of the national security business, think again. The company’s senior vice president for global affairs said Tuesday that the search giant has Pentagon contracts to work on cybersecurity, business automation, and deepfake detection — and is looking for more. 
“It’s been frustrating,” said Google’s Kent Walker, referring to rising public perceptions that the company is opposed to doing national security work — and to the narrative pushed by some Google rivals, such as Palantir’s Peter Thiel and their allies in Congress, such as Rep. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri.
Speaking at the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence conference, Walker said that Google is “fully engaged in a wide variety of work with different agencies” within the Defense Department. Its work with the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center includes cybersecurity, healthcare, and business automation. It is working with DARPA to “ensure the robustness of AI” and “progress the operation of hardware” beyond the expiration of Moore’s Law.
