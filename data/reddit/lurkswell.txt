can i access my wallet on a different computer if i download electrum and use my 12 words and pw?
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:41:22
it has been a few days still 0 confirmation and help or advice
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:42:16
i sent an email. they just told me to wait... will it ever get through? 
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:33:22
So it will confirm? It won't be stuck in limbo ? Did I lose that coin sent?
@_date: 2016-10-26 03:07:02
So is that money stuck in limbo ? What will happen to my coin and that transaction? 
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:38:31
so what will happen with the transaction ? and what does this mean for bitcoin?

are wallets like jaxx, bread, electrum safe to keep bitcoin in during the split? will the bitcoin split on its own and be on the same wallet? thanks

ive been buying bitcoin from them for a long time with no issue, last night i tried to buy some and the the purchase failed. they did charge my account. i checked back this morning and they did return it but was unable to buy. i tried to buy again this morning but it wouldnt let me and wont let me for a couple days, they need to take additional time to review my account, which ive had for years. never had an issue with buying bitcoin from them until now.really upset being with the price going up
