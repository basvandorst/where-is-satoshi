Must have been about five years ago, an acquaintance of mine pinged me about BitCoin and asked why I wasn't mining.  I was using AMD GPUs for Folding and some other OpenCL distributed computing projects and basically heating up my basement in the name of science.
Doing it in support of BTC became obvious once I had even a small understanding of the purpose and potential of BTC.  I instantly mourned not following the lead of folks in the VGA forum @ Anandtech and hitting this sooner.  The Distributed Computing subforum had me to distracted.
Figuring out how to get it going and running was fun.
My acquaintance knew I had the PC's, PSU's and central management stuff all figured out so he provided a couple of more efficient/powerful GPU's to the cause (2x 7950) and I kept my older cards running too - we got to \~8 BTC about the time the Ant Miners upped the difficulty enough that GPUs weren't creating enough hashrate to be useful.  Hindsight says we should not have stopped.
Late last year I sold what we split to help fund my new business.  HODL is the way to go, but dreams need fuel :)  I will be back!  Honestly, I need to buy a retired miner or two and run it during the winter here - I still have the army of PCs.  Sigh.  Figuring out how to get the miners online would be that same type of fun again, and I like the idea of paying for electricity more than I do taking fiat and putting it into the system, but that's just me.
The future for BTC is so awesome.
