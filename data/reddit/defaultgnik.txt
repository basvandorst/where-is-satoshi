Can I accidentally send anyone some bitcoin only to have you return my bitcoin +interest?
I know he spent a lot of time trying to get his bitcoin back, but it was his own mistake.

I understand the frustration of losing money, but I agree with OP. I'm basically just investing money I've recieved from faucet and bitcoin games and have been very happy wtih my returns so far. I have been really lucky, but have also learned a lot along the way and attribute that to some of my success. Another thing I've learned OP is I think credit rating A loans are the riskiest loans. 
Here's my thoughts: Every loan I invest in I figure I have a 50/50 chance of being repaid because I'll either get repaid or I won't. Anyone can walk away from a loan currently with very little risk. Let's say I invest in an A loan with a 10% ROI. If 1 of my 10 A loans default I've basically lost 1% (I think because if I invest 1 satoshi on every loan I should make 1.1 back. So 1.1 x 9 = 9.9, but I've invested 10) of my money. If i invest in 10 D rated loans with 100% ROI if only 6 of the D make full repayment I'm still ahead by 20% (if I invest 1 satoshi on each I should make back 12 satoshi back thus gaining 2 satoshi).
TLDR: I've been succesful on BTCjam. I think A loans are the riskiest loans on the site.

I don't think POP currently has the investor base. I haven't invested much BTC in it yet, but most of the loans I've tried to invest in time out before they fund. I've tried loanbase, but have made some careless choices so decided to just focus back on btcjam. Believe it or not I think investing on BTCjam and investing on Loanbase are two completely different animals even though the two sites are basically just about lending btc.
