So you are trying to find other people’s bitcoins but you aren’t going to steal them? Lol ok. You deleted the post for a reason. Go die in a fire. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:31:01
Was it an account with knc?
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:53:57
Put all the txids in the ant pool accelerator. I got it confirmed (10 sat/b) within 2 days
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:47:33
So you have iq of 56? I’m not surprised you made this post. If you were trying to recover your wallet, you would have said that. Holy shit you’re stupid

I put it in the anypool TX accelerator. Hopefully should be confirmed soon
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:48:40
Try to create a brainwallet with the seed( It will generate a private key and then you just import it into bitcoin. I
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:10:12
If you want to educate yourself, you should use google. Checking the balance is so easy. You are asking about colliding private keys
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:06:25
You don’t wanna get scammed, but you wanna steal people’s bitcoins. Fuck you
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:26:37
post the tx id of the transaction, or DM it to me
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:52:40
Haha you fucking idiot. You edited the post

Not sure if I understand what you are saying, but I am making a website for streamers to accept btc and optionally concert it to Paypal.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:12:28
He US dollar isn’t backed by anything anymore. Bitcoin is backed by math
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:31:08
You clearly haven’t been in crypto for more than a year. It does this EVERY January 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:51:39
Its sent to a coinbase address
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:49:42
unfortunately its from their website. I have no access to their bitcoind :(
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:31:08
This is happening because of tx accelerators
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:05:33
Use the Coinbase app for verification. Works really well
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:08:43
Tell her 5-10% of what you have and wait 2 months. If she starts going crazy with the money, dont say shit about the rest. If she continues to be smart with the money and not going on spending sprees, then you can tell her 25%, continue until you are at 100%!
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:47:42
Thats my fear. They paid so low im afraid it may get taken out of the mem pool. Blockcypher doesnt even recognise it
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:41:44
Use ur phone for I’d verification 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:47:40
Why the downvotes. I’m just asking a question :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:27
Ah, the good ole' null island node

You can get the death penalty under H.R. 2396
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:34:02
How would I do that through RPC? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:26:27
Take 2 seconds of your time and look at the bcash price before and after they launched. About 2 hours before bcash launched bcash went up by like 40%
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:51:09
Has nothing do do with this. This is changing code in bitcoin core. Not Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:06:14
So Coinbase launched an insider trading investigation on speculation? Ok
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:49:04
Ohhh. So essentially it’s all about the cost of running nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:40:41
Hey uhh, you left the “private” sticker on. You should pm me a picture without the private sticker
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:32:10
Don’t do any transactions over a few hundred. They always have issues with high value transactions. Other than that, welcome to bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:09:29
Can someone explain this to me? You can get the private keys from the public keys?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:36:25
Well, bitcoin reacts with bcash and in the end we lose all the bcash 
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:17:40
Nah Delaney is a fucking moron
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:28:14
Were you at the doctor?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:48:36
Hey uhh long lost brother you forgot to send me one!
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:52:49
How do I make a segwit address?
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:11:12
Dont tell her you have 200. Say you have 5 or something
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:07:50
How do I send a segwit transaction?
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:53:36
Would you spend 1k at a casino and not be upset if you lost it all?
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:24:38
Wait, to use Coinbase do u have to submit profit loss statements? Or is it only after a certain amount 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:08:27
So essentially stock market loans? That’s fucking retarded
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:14:15
Rude 
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:14:41
How is s2x an attack? (I’m not a supporter, I’m just wondering)
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:42:30
You definitely did. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:54:52
I’ve been in bitcoin for a while, but what is 2x? I know what segwit is, but why is 2x bad?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:15:50
There is a bitcoin atm 3 minutes from my house. I don’t use it. It’s a scam compared to Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:47:44
Because those other forks don’t try to advertise themselves as the one and only bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:16:00
I mean OBVIOUSLY ants aren’t causing stars to explode. Just because we know what ISNT causing something doesn’t mean we know what causes something
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:10:12
Genesis mining is such a scam lmao
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:24:40
Fuck your wife. She will probably throw them out or get scammed. RIP btc
