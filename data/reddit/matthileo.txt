Post proof specifically on this issue.

His link isn't a referral. check the url, no nonsense code or username.
That said, these sites are awful.

The current price of Bitcoin is well below its running average for the past I don't know few months maybe? Even if you miss the drop, and bought on the upturn there still a chance to buy cheaper than right now. It all depends on how low it's going to go.

I could be completely stupid, but it seems to me that this would have to be a bubble caused by all the people trying to make quick money without having to really do anything. 
Buying Bitcoin isn't like investing in the stock, there's no returns on your investment unless the price goes up ( yes I know, prices matter in stocks too, but so do other factors like profits in the company you're investing in ), the price goes up when people buy, and people buy because the price goes up. That sounds like a bubble to my simple, uneducated mind.
When people start buying Bitcoin only for its usefulness, and not for potential to make a profit, I'm thinking a lot less people will be buying.

What chart is this? bitcoinwisdom seems a bit broken atm
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:58:30
Boy are you asking the wrong person. I haven't the slightest and I doubt anyone who really follows BTC prices will have a better answer than "no way to tell".
It could be where it is now, and it could be $400, it all depends.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:15:50
9812.5ish bitcoin, or thereabouts. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:06:54
Yep. Definitely risks with waiting. I'm only into Bitcoin like 20 bucks right now, and probably only will end up buying another 30, and that on coinbase.
Just playing around really.
@_date: 2014-07-22 20:13:44
Bitcoin is easy, international law is hard
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:29:43
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:52:50
Didn't think so
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:05:19
Nice referral URL ya got there
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:31:38
Back up to 712 atm
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:54:37
Because it still works.
As I see it the only things that could kill bitcoin outright are a US ban or the discovery of a major technical flaw in the protocal. Otherwise (as long as bitcoin stays "hot"), every drop from bad news will have it's share of people looking to get in cheap, which will bring it back up. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:52:28


Come on man, you know that's a silly question. You know exactly why people buy bitcoins with no intention to use them.
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:07:39
~~Looks like someone has no idea how much proper printing and framing cost. It's not like going to walmart and getting a 1 hour photo and a 5 dollar frame~~
EDIT: holy crap that's the price just for the print? You guys are nuts.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:56:58
I woke up and saw the chart across the room and went "huh, the line's flat, that's weird...what's that at the end?"
Missed the fun bit though lol.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:54:31
Could be one of those trap thingies?
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:49:21
Is this actually confirmed somewhere?
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:47:47
That's not the title of the actual article, just fyi

Sign of the top?

As someone who knows very little about Bitcoin, is this not a good way to avoid campaign finance laws?
Edit: IIRC you can see all the transactions for any better address. This would be the opposite of a good way to avoid campaign finance laws.
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:50:17
Heh. Yeah. Don't really have the money on hand that I can just let sit in BTC sadly. Oh well, this is still fun to watch and learn how to read the market.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:25:10
If only you could get him to stop talking long enough to check.
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:57:23
Yeah, same here.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:13:28
I don't think anyone here should assume you have insider knowledge on this issue. Post proof please.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:31:04
Like politically conservative? What would that have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:15:45
Thanks! I'll do my best!
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:13:28
That's how I'm doing it.

To the moon!
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:05:46
Oi mods! How about we block this domain? Is that possible?
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:34:41
What price will you be buying at. Looks like it's at 772ish right now?
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:25:00
Yup. Entirely possible I just missed the moment. Or it could go back down. Fun stuff.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:33:05
Don't think these posts are allowed...
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:06:23
Guess it's good(?) they aren't mentioning the $100 thing LOL.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:23:24
Well, half a pint.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:57:19
People on here seem to prefer to buy during a drop, rather than trying to guess when the bottom will hit
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:06:28
Someone in the xbox thread tipped me $2.50, so I started tipping people left and right. Small amounts, because that's what I've got, but it's still awesome to be a part of that. 
Anyway, to everyone in the threads tipping left and right, thank you. You're making people's days over there.

Cheeky bugger
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:04:46
I think it's niave to think that a US ban wouldn't be a death sentence. 
As for "something better", that's a definite possibility but it would have to offer something substantially better than BTC and be able to build up a fast momentum. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:49:24
It will be a long time before bitcoin's value is determined solely by its usefulness.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:03:28
~~I think they find it good news in the sense that they can time their buys so it looks like the price is going up with the news, and then sell and make some fast money.~~
Sorry, my bad.
***TO THE MOON!***
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:47:34
Yeah. Makes sense. The BTCE charts on bitcoin wisdom are also completely frozen now.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:22:55
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:33:39
Ah. Gotcha. Just wasn't sure what you meant.
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:53:07
 if you don't want to use a referral link. Not that these sites are worth the time anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:18:20
The Blacklist had an FBI computer agent use Bitcoin for some kind of transfer or other
Edit: 
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:54:12
Then become a burglar
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:56:39
I think this is a valid question. Wouldn't it just show to them as a transfer between two paypal users? They'd never have any indication that it was for BTC.
I think it's more likely is talking about paypal's problems in general, and not something specifically related to bitcoin.
As another redditor once said, "paypal works great until it doesn't, and then you're screwed". Or something to that effect.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:41:00
Well this is awesome.
