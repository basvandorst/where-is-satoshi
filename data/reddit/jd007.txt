@_date: 2018-05-25 08:49:28
Yea  cool  budy!  I'll  get  to  you  tonight  for  sharing  some  thoughts 
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:42:40
Did  you  noticed   that  3  version  script ?  Not  as  normal  it  would.  Extra layer of  security   and  that  BTC  actually  came  from  4  multi  transactions.
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:52:49
I want to know  about   version  3  scripit .. thats  the  problem  starting  with 3 
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:58:54
First  you  have  to  deal  with  the   3  starting  in  address  after  then  everything  wilm be  easy ...
Am  sure  70%   will  end  with  no  result  due  to  multi  signature address ....  if  you  have  the  right  seed  the   drive  address  with  it  which  starts  with  3  !!! 
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:53:51
And  also   y 
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:52:18
I am   curious   how  would  we  come  to  find  address  starting  with  3 ?   Every  try  made  brings an  address   starting  with  1   so  how  to  look  for  3?   Does  it  includes  passphrase  if  yes  then why  did  he said  -1  less  step ? 
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:08:31
I  just  cameup   with  (y)   lambda ....  along   with  infinity 
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:03:16
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
this pictures tells the whole story about it.  no need to go any where else ,  the answer is right in here
@_date: 2018-10-14 09:08:53

@_date: 2017-11-30 14:29:55
Yes ...  i  have  read  more  about  those  algorithms  that  applies  while   encodig  into  PV  Key    but  i  dont  know  how  they  brute  force  it  ?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:37:31

@_date: 2018-12-11 05:33:34
i want to know how these addresses were generated ?   by using some VanityGen 64  or  any other utility,  seems interesting though!  
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:21:29
So tell us how much you got and what was the exit price dude ? 
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:04:08
Hahaha  yes  
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:53:49
Well...  let me tell you one thing
You are still in a list of  EARLY ADOPTERS  some where ...  HODL  my Friend 
@_date: 2018-12-11 08:09:52
watched the wholes video and according to my  analysis  this make sense to some extent !!! 
The Year 2019 mid also bearish and we will see some Good stuff after 2020 for sure :) 
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:57:46
Hahaha   you  lucky  bastard .. Good though 
@_date: 2018-12-17 05:06:28
Who  knows ! 
@_date: 2018-12-17 04:57:30
Aah .. thanks  corrected !
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:58:41
Thanks :) 
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:39:28
Thats  it  Good 2 go, but hey if you have some other investment dont buy at 1 price lets say if you have  50,000$ to invest then Buy bitcoin at 3000$   then  2500$  , 2000$ , 1500$ ... on different Prices i mean.  because you dont know if it goes up or down. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:13:45
Its was on  exchanges  dude 
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:37:11
Well you did
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:39:24
Hahaha   damn !!!
@_date: 2018-12-17 04:13:28
Yes  exactly :) 
Never miss the Train again ! 
@_date: 2018-12-17 10:34:19
Yes  thats  why i  said that
@_date: 2018-12-17 05:55:16
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:10:56
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:50:21
Seems like 
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:37:42
Its ok ...  you can buy bitcoin for  your kids  and  for sure  your  Grand sons  too   haha !!!   Think  this  like as  you are in early  1900's  and  you are  investing in Real Estate.  I think  that makes  sense  .. just be an EARLY ADOPTER-  This is our  Generation  only  we are the owners of this  E-Cash  system 
Think Long Term and HODL BITCOIN  ! 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:02:53
Its ok .  We will be Hodling for the Better 
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:22:21
Correct !
