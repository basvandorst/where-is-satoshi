Lmfao fucking nice
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:51:58
You're gonna wish you bought @ 19.5k in 3 months:p lol
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:35:42
It just did lol woo
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:45:42
ayy made it

Basically he's dealing with a shitty doxxer, considering his username could be his real name. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:45:45
Another note by the way: your account is pretty easy to doxx considering that you have your first and last name as your reddit account name. They can just search you on Facebook, Twitter,or other social media, and find your IP/location via a simple Skype search. So I would report this guy to the authorities via the site admins, and delete this account.

Saving this
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:18:29

@_date: 2017-03-10 21:31:49
No shit lmao
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:43:57
This is info on that address, it hasn't been used yet
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:30:39
Does it work and what are the returns?
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:15:45
because all leadership is bad?
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:06:34
Sure, the fee is weird, but once I get the coins they immediately go to a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-01-12 17:33:58
You just happened to buy at a bad time. Don't sell on a loss, because then you won't make anything off of it. At this point for you i would wait until you can break even and then if you don't feel comfortable with BTC you could leave. Track your profits and losses in a spreadsheet. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:56:44
Lol rip if they do that I should bail now, with a $40 loss and then make it up by buying a bunch of coins at low peak for when it goes up
@_date: 2017-01-12 17:28:25
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:37:15
Yeah it's just for fun :P so I'm not looking to turn a profit
@_date: 2017-01-09 04:12:32
WEB BOT SAYS BUY FULL SPEED AHEAD YAARRR

@_date: 2017-01-08 05:25:15
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:13:10
there was a 24 hour hold so i used the bank instead, either way I don't mind, i was going to let the amount set for a month and see where it was at
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:16:53
;D I don't have 50btc

nice meme
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:21:36
Thanks! I'll take a look :)
@_date: 2017-01-09 04:08:04
Use gemini, don't make the mistake I did and use coinbase
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:24:41
Can you explain the difference between Gemini and coinbase?
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:53:33
Don't sell on a loss ever. If you don't feel confident at least wait until you've made your money back
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:25:26
Yep, textbook case I'm done at $4400. Cya when it drops back
@_date: 2017-01-16 07:39:33
How can you tell?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:00:28
Hope it doesn't go down anymore but we've seen this trend before. (Not saying bitcoin is a bubble, trust me I've got a lot resting on this week) just saying get ready to hodl
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:22:48
I'm out now lol cya at the bottom boys
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:30:27
bitcoin will always go up. But the parabolic nature is unsustainable at this recent rate to maintain, and once the first crash happened you saw a return to peak and then the dip we're undergoing now. It should steady around $8k-$7k and then rise again. 
@_date: 2019-09-11 23:23:17
Holy fuck oh no this sounds like mlm
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:12:46
Now buy more when it dips &lt;:
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:23:50
More like $1400 lol this mirrors the same chart as the last dip. Boys this bubble has pressure and its popping, I sold out @ 2700 and I'm going back in when it stabilizes
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:07:48
Hope so! I dumped at 2700 
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:41:37
It just dipped $100 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:16:21
I want to say 4x as long as it took to rise to this price, so a steady decline as people realize btc is hitting their previous bought point and look to make a profit
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:13:13
Hodl but prepare for the drop, buy the cheap coins :D
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:15:19
For it's low cap before returning to the mean
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:15:36
That's the wallet I use! It's great
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:06:46
The dip isn't here yet
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:18:07
Sometimes I like playing runescape and doing my homework. On the week days I relax with my gf, weekends are spent chilling at the beach w/ family. Mainly just relaxing since it's summer and college doesn't start again for a while.
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:04:53
Fractal love
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:12:36
Oh yeah hodl but I should have said prepare for the drop :P my bad
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:56:59
It just dropped $300 so
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:11:23
Perfect! Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:10:29
you could have seen this a mile away just look up "Bitcoin times searched" google and you can see a huge spike before every drop
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:14:59
Oh okay thank you :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:57:31
OKAY SO IT MIGHT DIP SOON DONT KILL YOURSELF JUST BE PATIENT PLS
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:22:51
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:25:26
Just use gemini
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:41:46
It just dipped $100 
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:02:46
This week 100% I bet within the next 2 days
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:41:14
It just dipped $100 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:24:42
2700 checking in
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:48:04
Heyy we were right
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:41:21
It just dipped $100 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:19:14
use gemini not coinbase, coinbase has some issues right now
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:13:48
Hodl but watch for drop :P I should have said get ready to buy
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:30:34
I'm glad someone else noticed this. I'm waiting a few days to buy again
@_date: 2017-07-08 08:11:17
Oh shit I visited here once on a trip! Try the spaghetti nearby it's great 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:36:10

@_date: 2017-05-09 21:41:32
It just dipped $100 
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:35:00
After Aug 1st oc
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:21:27
I don't think so, but I would say if it would reflex, it would be within the next week or month and would go to ~$1300 to 1400 based on a linear upward trend. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:23:09
I agree mass adoption isn't going to happen soon, but the roots are being planted for a large crypto currency network as the world becomes more connected to help stabilize a global economy.
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:30:36
Started with criminals lmao, still has a lot of criminals with it. 
I've been with btc from the start but you can't deny that :p
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:03:15
Minor dips, not major ones. Minor dip is going to happen soon this isn't stable
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:53:06


Nice argument though? My whole profile is full of gaming subreddits :p you just sound like a salty guy that's upset btc went down $500 today. I've been in btc since it was $10 and I can safely say your attitude is childish and not representative of the btc subreddit since I've been here. 
It'll go back up. You're trying to shit on people that agreed with you :p 
Mind you I got gilded once for promoting bitcoin so I can't be a "shill" for btc. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:07:22
This dude's a salt factory don't worry :p he's probably mad he can't use mommy's credit card anymore. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:00:36
Lmao we need Korean connections to make sure we're not in a bubble
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:59:18
Try another exchange then besides gemini. I'm sure there are plenty which would be happy to help you trade your btc and crypto. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:44:36


Your thoughts are dangerous for bitcoin's functionality in the world. I'm saying this as a full investor of bitcoin.    
Bitcoin will reach $4,000 but not every drop is because of "shills"

I can make one on shape ways if you want to pay for it

@_date: 2017-06-13 07:39:40
You forgot this "/s"
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:23:35
Bitcoin price stability is what I'm talking about here. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:21:29
Yep I posted this last crash 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:36:49
Nah I'm there with you
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:24:15
I put in $5k for shits and giggles. 
Pleasantly surprised, just checking on it every now and then. Don't put in what you can't afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:07:24
I went from green to hard red. (Lost $3000 across all crypto) but I'm not counting it as a loss until we reach the fucking pits of hell and I sell. Sell = loss. So even if it takes a year I'll just have to wait to cash out for profit. Or we could implement it in stores across the country and world to help support the ever growing and crashing bubbles!
