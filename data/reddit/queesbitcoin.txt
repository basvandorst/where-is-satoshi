If you pay a little extra, you can get them to say whatever you want.

I've been doing this now. Took me way too much in fees to figure out lol

Thank you!

I have considered renting a safety deposit box just in case. More money, but when Bitcoin is going as high as I believe it will, that monthly cost is going to be nothing..
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:26:16
So should I keep my previous private key from copay just in case, or will the new one suffice?
Sorry for the noob questions. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:17:44
I remember reading about this a while ago. It has definitely been on my mind, but what truly is a 100% guaranteed and safe way to store coins....thanks for making others aware though.

I would also like to know. I recently created a mycelium wallet, but with all the negativity recently, I need to move. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:19:19
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:42:32
I think you are gonna have to pay in cash...

Please, buy a hardware wallet. You won't be disappointed. Do your research and go with the one that is most convenient for you.

Wasn't in stock when I was looking.

You da real MVP!

Once you are in your wallet, look for the send tab. Unfortunately Coinbase does not allow for custom fees, so expect it to be higher than other wallets. Once you have your other wallet ready, triple check the address and send it. Should show up right away, but may not confirm for a bit.

Please do not put in more than you can lose. If he doesn't want to take a risk, so be it. I know you mean well and want him to make money, but maybe he doesn't want to lose more than HE can lose. 
This is new to many people and there is going to be tons of skeptical people out there, even when (if) it hits 20k+. 
My .02, don't take out a loan. There have been some extremely lucky mofos here, but that does not mean it is going to work for you. If you do take out a loan and make a good profit, I can send you my BTC address LOL (jk).

The fact you don't own your own keys is what prevents me from keeping them on Coinbase. If you do some browsing on this sub, you will see numerous posts about why it is not the best option to store. 
As far as transferring, do you mean transfer money or coins?
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:18:54
If BTC crashes tomorrow to $0.00, will you be able to pay him back? Believe me when I tell you I know risk is what makes you money. Plus I'm not sure what your relationship with your pops is. 
Money can be an evil thing my friend...
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:49:49
Good luck.

Trezor. I just got one a bit ago and absolutely love it. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:18:24
t(-.-t) JK. Just jealous.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:47:56
When you acquire a hardware or mobile wallet that allows you to keep your own keys, you will be provided with a group of 12 to 24 words that are randomly selected. It is important for you to keep these words safe because you will need it to recover your wallet.

Bought my trezor off Amazon. Great so far. Just look at the vendor and history if going third party.

"If something like this is powerful enough to shake governments at their core, it says something."
I seem to have forgotten that.

When you purchase it, there are videos that you can watch to help you set it up on their site. It's super simple, believe me. If you need help or have more questions, send me a private message and I'll be more than happy to help you.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:15:45
With my luck, the moment I sell it will skyrocket. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:13:55
Lmao. I'm sorry, but that is funny.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:50:42
No one knows for sure. Just sit back and watch if you can.
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:29:53
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:25:56
It happens all the time. Just zoom out, you'll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 10:47:26
Would have never known this. Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:19:52
I ordered one, but it won't get here until after August 1.
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:20:41
Did not know that about Electrum. Thank you.

Did not know that about Electrum. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-06 10:46:49
Didn't even think of that. Will do this now.
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:25:24
I hope so.
