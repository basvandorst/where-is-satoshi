Do you really think Bitcoin is decentralized?

I've lost faith in the project. A lot of people have been hurt, and there are just too many better investments out. Just my opinion. We'll see what happens.

LOL won't go that far. i'll be back in at 99 so i can ride it back down.

you are right. they are both poor investments for totally different reasons.

you need to check your grammar moron.  "is a bunch" vs. "are people". hopefully your mom is teaching you investment strategy better than she taught you grammar. LOL

no worries. i know many who have lost 10s of thousands and keep losing.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:26:53
all of that was true. and i became preoccupied with it again and ended up losing a lot of those winnings. paid my capital gains (monumental pain in ass to figure out) and I ended up with some meagre gains. In meantime, i put too much energy into this negative whirlwind for too long... and here I am again wasting time again. There are more productive things to do in life, and we should all get on with it. Gambling is an addiction.

I've been also following this for years. I've made a lot of money and lost a lot of money. I would guess that now there is a bunch of people who lost their shirts in 2018, probably got out at $4,5,6k... last week they got all upset seeing the run-up and got in at $7500+ pushing the price to a final high of $8500. They are losing their shirts again, and this time they will take whatever they have left when this turd hits $2k and bitcoin will be over. From experience, this is total BS.

there has to be a better way to make a living than fleecing gamblers dude. find something with better karma.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:33:23
ok dude. good luck.

your strange combination of poor grammar and sad self-righteousness makes it hard to tell if you are american or english.
