So maybe reinstalling wont solve my problem. It's been synching 300 days of blocks for about 5 hours now. You're saying if I re-install it will have to resynch all the data ever? Wouldn't I be in about the same position I'm in?

Are you familiar with QT? Would the private-key be the 10digitormore 'encryption password' option in  the file menu of QT on the overview screen?

Electrum sounds like the best solution - you're saying I could import my wallet data to Electrum and recieve my pretty bitcoins I'm expecting that are being sent to my QT-generated address?

WHAT I DID TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, KIND OF, AKA, A WORKAROUND. 
Backstory: This was also my first bitcoin transaction ever. &amp; I'm not even mildly a computer genius. 
1. Gave up on reloading bitcoin QT. (After other people said I had some other options besides verifying every bitcoin transaction ever made, I wanted to go one of those routes.)
2. Backed up my  wallet.dat to a file on my desktop so I didn't lose it. (I was fucking scared of losing it)
3. Uploaded wallet.dat to :   --- (since this was my first transaction, it's not like I had a lot of coins in my wallet so I figured I'll upload it here, cash in what I will, and move the rest someplace more secure) 
4. Made a coinbase account. 
5. Linked it to bank account with instant verification. (pretty neat) 
6. Copied generated on coinbase (they don't explain it but coinbase is also sort of a 'wallet') 
7. Pasted that address into the field on the page for sending coins on the Blockchain Wallet Page. Hit send. HELD BREATH CUZ I SENT A BUNCH OF MONEY THROUGH SPACE. The computer made a weird noise, like a DOS-y sort of beep. 
8. Refreshed my Coinbase wallet and TA-DAA, they were there!!!
9. Waited while the transaction was 'pending' for a little under hour. (This is normal)
10. Sent to bank account. 
11. Profited.

That's what I would prefer to do but I can't seem to get this answered:
I really don't have the blockchain data. I didn't synch QT for months and months. If I reinstall QT, will I somehow be able to 'mass-download' all the blockchains I missed or will I basically be in  the same situation (waiting endlessly for blockchain synch)

So just to clarify because I think this might be my solution: I can upload my recently saved wallet.dat file to that site and I will be able to receive bitcoins to the original address generated in QT, to that online wallet? 
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:46:29
will do 
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:47:00
I wish I could get my BTC in my damn wallet and send you some GOLD. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:11:28
If I wasn't smart enough to recognize your scam-offer, I'd almost say you were flirting with me! 
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:08:43
..  that would be perfect. So I'll be able to get a payment from someone someone sending me BTC to an address in my bitcoin QT if I upload the wallet.dat file to there? Sorry, just trying to make sure i tot ally understand before I lose my monayy.

This will be my first transaction so, sorry if I sound like an idiot. 
I installed Bitcoin QT months ago. Never did anything. It just sat there. 
Now since yesterday, I am expecting a payment to this address. 
I don't think the payment has been sent yet but I'm trying to get things set up so I can actually take it. 
I open bitcoin QT. All looks normal (completely empty) and the synch bar is moving SLOWLY, like, .01% every few minutes but it is actually moving. 
If i reinstall QT, point the install file toward my brandspankingnew wallet.dat, I will have no more blockchain info then I have now, (I think) because I legitimately did not even touch the Bitcoin QT client for a very long time. Is that true? 
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:06:20
Thanks. Just nervous. It's a big payment to this address. : / 
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:20:44
Do you know if I'd be able to link up Electrum to the address created in QT that I'm receiving this payment to? 
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:18:33
So QT can be sort of 'uploaded' to blockchain but addresses created online using Blockchain will not 'synch' to my desktop bitcoin client. Do you know if that's true for all the programs or just QT? 
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:44:56
AHhhh! 'Export'! I think that's it. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:16:48
You're referring to having an 'online wallet' right? 
I realize that anyone who can hack into blockchain's system could get it. I guess that's why I'm not keeping a HUGE sum of money in bitcoin.
