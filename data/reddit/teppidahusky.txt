It’s probably China buying and others are exchange volume. Eg Binance (Malta)

If you are that indecisive, you shouldn’t invest in anything. Every price move will just make you feel sick so why bother

Idk wait for confirmation from your taxi driver

Any forecasting before today have been wrong. Cryto moves much faster than we think

There is no such thing as "healthy" in crypto especially bitcoin. It pumps and dumps hard. We are very far from stable market.

If you think the price will go higher then buy it now
If you think you could hodl when the price drop hard then buy it now
If non the above is not what you think then DO NOT buy

They are pretending they know how the market works but infact nobody does

Welcome to crypto, if you are not a trader then you either sell high or HODL. Do not listen to any “experts”. Binance deposits and withrawls are suspended but users still can trade. From my point of view when their services resume normal the market will pump because binance users still can tether as of now if they want to sell.

Be thankful that you bought bitcoin at $7400
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:18:34
I think we could drop to $3k or even lower in bear market but not now
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:56:57
So when the price crash you will be asking yourself the same question again “should I wait for it to drop lower?”
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:42:51
No. Shitpost
