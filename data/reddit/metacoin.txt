Ah, I meant to compare simply the fact that the clip is taken out of context, not the fact that he could/couldn't leave. It's less obvious here that the interviewer(s) are pestering Wright, but it seems to me this could be the case.
Either way, I'm interested to listen to the rest of the interview. The Satoshi mystery is a fascinating chapter in the history of bitcoin.

The argument of "centralized banking is fine" reminds me of the "windows is the best operating system" line of thinking. 
You'll notice that people who think windows is the best OS are also those who *are forced to use windows because the applications they want to use don't exist on other operating systems*. 
That's analogous to living under an oppressive regime and claiming your dictator is the best leader in the world.
If the applications people wanted existed on other operating systems, everyone would switch to a superior operating system in a heartbeat. 
Bitcoin needs time to develop and mature to the level of centralized banking, and in the meantime it will continue to do its thing in its niche. How long it will take for Bitcoin to catch up and overtake the legacy system is anyone's guess.

There was a video the other day that showed a man driving an Uber literally screaming at the top of his lungs at an annoying woman (his passenger) not leaving his car. It was socially acceptable for him to scream at her to leave his car because she was refusing to leave him alone.
I think this is a similar situation: we haven't heard the first 60 min of this recording, but if Curtois is taking cheap shots and egging Wright on throughout that entire hour (as he does in the few minutes of this video), wouldn't it be similarly reasonable for Wright to lose his temper a little bit? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:48:38
Bob and Craig are both correct here: Curtois is claiming that Craig could have gotten the keys from those blocks using the same analysis he and his students did. That claim is nonsense because the reversed keys they found are usually from weak javascript/android RNG generators (brainwallet like Craig pointed out, or android as you pointed out).
Curtois is claiming that Wright has somehow obtained the keys through a similar process of reverse engineering, rather than having them to begin with. Wright is frustrated that Curtois won't show him any example of this being possible other than if the signature was created with a weak RNG library.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:36:58
My bullshit detector went crazy here. The recording starts at an odd point, where we have zero context of what's going on. I think you're right about the recording starting after the signed message is presented, as Courtois seems to make the claim that any private key could be obtained from a signed message on the blockchain, he goes further to explain that at his university he has obtained thousands of keys from transactions on the blockchain (which Wright counters with the fact that they are all probably originating from crappy brainwallet.js seeds which is likely the case). 
Also, Courtois takes a cheap shot at Wright by mentioning the Australian tax authority for absolutely no reason. He goes on to shout about being "more qualified" than Wright. Definitely not a strong argument.

For each algorithm there exists hardware that is "super efficient" at processing it compared to stock consumer-grade electronics. There are no exceptions to this rule.
The issue you've identified is more related to the barrier to entry of buying this efficient mining machine and using it properly. 
Another issue is the psychology of producing mere pennies worth of bitcoins every day, even with efficient mining hardware. The exciting, speculative environment of 2009-2010 (in terms of potential mining ROI) is gone.

It's not free if you have to submit proof-of-work before transacting. That's similar to saying generating bitcoins is free.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:17:21


Proof-of-work is used to send transactions because otherwise there would be no way to stop spam. Proof-of-work is useful as a spam-stopping mechanism because it introduces a trade-off between spamming the network and using up a scarce resource (computing power, electricty).
Fundamentally the amount of proof-of-work required to send a transaction must not be free because free transactions would result in infinite spam transactions clogging up the network.

If we reduce the block time to 1 second that doesn't mean transactions confirm in 6 seconds. What matters is the amount of work done and the estimated probability of an adversarial miner having enough hashpower to 51% attack before anyone else on the network is able to mine a block.

Twitter is more susceptible to this attack than reddit is. Think about someone trying to impersonate Elon Musk on reddit. What barriers to success do they face?
1. Reddit has volunteer subreddit moderators who actively scan and delete scam comments and threads
2. Reddit users can downvote, warning other users of bad quality content, if it's not caught by a mod first
3. It's a lot harder to trick someone into thinking Elon Musk is posting on reddit than on twitter because of profile images, display name vs account name, and other things Twitter has that reddit does not. Usually when a celeb wants to post on reddit, they need to provide a ton of verification on their OP, including an image of themselves holding a paper with the date on it combined with additional verification from moderators. This is usually done **for each post** a celeb writes on reddit. On Twitter that caution is thrown to the wind.
Taking a look at the recent tweets about Bitcoin on twitter, compared to the number of messages on this subreddit, one can conclude that crypto twitter has much more traffic than \- approximately 50x more messages per hour.
I'd also like to add that, in my opinion, the thread style of twitter is also much more conductive for scams. It's impossible to call out a scam because scammers reply to their own tweets 5 times, stuffing the visible part of the page with semi-related filler text. The ability to post enticing images of a giveaway with each comment makes things worse.
Overall, twitter is uniquely positioned for this type of scam, and the properties of their system make it very hard for them to combat this. No moderators. No downvotes. No thread trees. Display name vs account name. Much more traffic and many more potential victims.

Using a digital signature in this manner can be a double-edged sword. If (when) the private key is compromised, it is an ongoing problem as the attacker makes claims and broadcasts messages as an imposter.
Sure, there are ways to solve that problem. Esoteric solutions exist; HD key structures and revocation methods come to mind, however there are no real standards. 
Consensus and authentication are the end goals. Digital signatures are great for what they are used for, but in the context of Government, it's best to use widely accepted communication channels. Radio, Television and Internet broadcasts (Twitter) are the best way to communicate with a wide audience quickly and effectively incurring the lowest risk of impersonation.

Good questions. If our next report is tailored to US-based businesses, it would most likely include data during normal business hours for US customers and online shoppers. Regionalized data might be another avenue to explore later on.
To address volatility caused by "day trading": finding spikes in exchange activity that result in high volumes that also correlate to large amounts of 5/10/15/60 minute volatility are especially interesting to merchants who may not have the capacity to endure the risk involved in accepting Bitcoin. 
Comparing the magnitude of volatility during short periods of intensive trading on different exchanges might also be something to look at.

@_date: 2014-03-31 19:52:20
I have discussed a similar idea with some professionals who are involved in the pharmaceutical industry as well as nurses and physicians. Although this idea sounds good on paper, the logistics behind it are quite complicated.
To boil down the issues, here are the main problems with a decentralized "proof-of-perscription" service:
* HIPAA laws.
* The existing e-script or eRx systems already check for "double spending" prescriptions, and are trusted. 
* It would be a significant challenge to convince a doctor's office to trust this new system, or that there are advantages to a "crypto-currency based prescription trading".
* Restructuring the entire script industry. Most of the eRx systems come with "bells and whistles" that make other parts of the prescription process more convenient. These parts cannot easily be replicated in a decentralized manner. For example, most eRx systems email/call the pharmacy + doctor + patient when the prescription is ready and when refills are available. 
In the end, you have to wonder whether or not there would be really any significant gain here over the "trusted 3rd party" system that's already in place. It is entirely possible that all of the weaknesses that exist in the current system can be solved by proper use of digital signatures alone, without decentralization thrown in the mix.

The root of this problem is also related to scarcity of computing power; this ultimately leads to scalability growing pains. If the price of hardware were not as high, transaction fees wouldn't have been as high to begin with. The price of hardware directly influences the price of bandwidth, disk space, and computational potential. These are all factors that lead to high anti-spam fees on the network. It is a significant macro problem to solve.
Tragically, this all could be fixed with consensus from mining pool operators, of which there are very few.

Hi! I've been developing a type of color coin implementation in an alt-coin (Florincoin) that has the capacity for decentralized apps built into the block chain. I have a showcase of this working at  and it's important to note that all data here is pulled live from the blockchain. The idea is similar to master coin, but you don't have to send bitcoins to an "exodus address" to be able to use it! 
The idea is in beta, but for the purposes you need (simply tracking rewards points) it can be implemented right now for your business. You should shoot me an email - support 
If you want people to be able to trade their points on the color coin network, our trade platform and verification system is under development.  It will be usable by the general public soon. 
Good luck with your business, I think you have the right idea by going in the direction of crypto rewards. The advantages are many!

I've reviewed the code for those who cannot review it themselves (or don't have the time) and it seems like a change to simply make things more user-friendly.
The old version let you choose from a dropdown how many repetitions you'd like to execute, instead you now chose "normal" or "high" security which makes two function calls to determine the min and max repetitions to make. 
`SharedCoin.getMinRecommendedIterations()` and 
As far as I can tell, min is always 4 and max is always 8, though they seem to be set by a configuration not located in this repo. There is also some ternary operator math that randomly selects +1 or -1 for each of the values.
For example, if you choose "normal" security (and the MinRecommendedIterations stays at 4) you'll always have 3 or 5 repetitions. 
I'm assuming they'll add an input box under "advanced options" or something similar later on.
If you're really dead-set on choosing how many repetitions you want, you can always manually edit the javascript on the page. However, I haven't reviewed any of the other code so doing this may not be a good thing.

It is true that we are using Florincoin for that reason, but it is not the only reason we have decided to implement that blockchain for Alexandria.
Having a community aligned with the ideology of the apps we're creating is an important distinction.
The DAO hack highlights the importance of philosophy in software: blockchain censorship-resistance and autonomy is a function of how strongly the community behind that system believes in those core values.
It doesn't hurt to have the developers supporting extensions and updates that benefit the apps built on that chain.
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:37:52
There are three practical reasons:
1. Alexandria, and decentralized messaging-based apps, have specific needs that are better met by an alt-coin. At the end of the day, you always want to use the best tool for the job. 
2. Our community doesn't have nearly enough members to influence the Bitcoin community's policy in our favor. This could be a significant hurdle to getting the necessary changes made to support our platform.
3. Bitcoin has a larger group of developers, and similar to other "David vs Goliath" scenarios, being a small close-knit group of peers means we can more efficiently execute on things and more easily stay aligned with our goals. Not always true, but in general it is easier for smaller groups to maintain this advantage.
Personally, I also think Bitcoin should be a pure store of value and payment network; parallel systems can provide unique blockchain-based applications. Satoshi touched on this early on I believe.
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:38:21
Yeah, but you'd still have to pay for the messages, and to reach the "real internet" you'd still have to go through an ISP.

I think your argument contains a logical flaw.


When some people on the network identify themselves, it hurts the anonymity of others who transact with identified keys. 


Unfortunately "no one else can see this info" is not entirely true, due to subpoena powers, social engineering, and general human trust issues.
This bip hurts fungibility by making some addresses "good" and some "bad". 
I don't see any advantage to it other than allowing some companies to continue to operate under the current archaic regulatory structures. So then the argument boils down to this question: do you think bitcoin is a tool for breaking out from underneath those structures, or do you think it's something that should exist below them? Your position, from what I can gather, is that bitcoin should subject itself to the same regulation most of its users find unacceptable.

I think a better way to sell this is the same way people sell BTC: it costs a bit more to transact, but people are paying for it and it's worth it because of the properties of BTC that are unlike anything else on Earth. Applying this same reasoning to data makes sense, especially that with LN you have the option of paying just a few sats to send it.

This is really good feedback, thank you, I'll reach out to the team and see what can be done. Keep in mind that filming ended around the time the CW controversy was just beginning, so it might have also been left in as a "now this is happening" sort of thing, but in hindsight it looks out of place. Definitely a good catch.

It's because of max reorg depth.
@_date: 2019-08-10 04:29:56
BCH has max reorg depth which is why it isn't getting 51% attacked. Consensus on max reorg depth chains require the attacker to take over the network as well as the hashrate. The trade-off is that honest fragmentation of network connectivity can cause irreversable forks.

Currently we're using the libraries [feross/webtorrent]( as well as [mafintosh/peerflix]( to accomplish Alexandria streaming capabilities. I believe seeding begins as soon as the stream process starts, but there are settings to throttle it. We need to add those settings to the front-end of our application still. 
Additionally, if you're worried about seeding potentially harmful data, we are planning on releasing curated filter lists (on an opt-in, subscription basis) to prune out the "bad" stuff.

You can think of it as a DIY iTunes if you're a content creator.

@_date: 2015-04-17 16:51:37
You'd use Alexandria in conjunction with torrents. BitTorrent is an essential part of the Alexandria protocol. 
There are a few advantages to Alexandria over regular torrents:
* Magnet links are stored on the blockchain
* Publishers list their address for tips / pay-what-you-want models
* The Alexandria client can stream music and video directly from peers
* For those not technically inclined, it's much easier and much more user friendly than a standard BitTorrent client

We thought it would be appropriate to provide some search terms to locate the data somewhere on the web or in offline storage if the torrent ends up going down. Providing filesize, date, and descriptive information could lead to finding the file if you're searching for it in a space other than the BitTorrent network.
It also allows the front-end to populate a list of media with some information without relying on the DHT.

I agree, keychain is nebulous while wallet is more or less accurate.

If you need bitcoins to send a transaction, someone at some point had to go through a PoW process to get the coins, then send them to you.
So yes, at some point PoW had to take place before you could send a transaction (in the hypothetical situation where free transactions didn't exist).

...the point of the comic is that if you use bitcoins to purchase things over the internet, you aren't charged a fee because the workload of verifying the transaction is built into the system. Unlike credit card transactions, which have a fee associated with each purchase.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:33:37
There are many answers to his question which you may have missed. Ask him if he has ever tried to send money overseas or even transfer a large amount of money within the same domestic bank to another person's bank account. There are limits and fees associated with all of these things, limits being transfer amount limits as well as the amount of time it takes (up to 5 business days). Additionally, owning a bank account usually means the bank holds a certain amount of funds of yours hostage which you cannot use without incurring a fee. Credit card companies charge vendors for each transaction, and you're reliant on their network being up to conduct business. When their network goes down, so does your business. A p2p protocol such as Bitcoin is virtually unaffected by downtime at a singular node.
* There are no ridiculous fees for transferring money anywhere in the world.
* The wait time is very short compared to most bank transfers.
* There is no limit to the amount of funds that can be transferred within a day.
* You can use all of your funds without having to hold a minimum balance in your "account".
* There is no charge per transaction when dealing in Bitcoins alone.
* You are not reliant on another 3rd party network (Bank, Credit Card company, payment gateway) for the transaction to be possible or verify.

Bitcoin is an incredible technology and has many advantages over Paypal in this situation. Here are a few:
1) Fees kill this idea. 3% fee + $0.30 is terrible for parking lots which may take an average of $1-$3 per patron.


2) I'm not sure how you could use paypal to pay for an individual parking spot without having to use a machine or special app to let the merchant know which spot you're parking in. For this idea, one spot = one Bitcoin address, which seems very easy for any parking garage/lot to implement, given a meter with very minimal hardware and software requirements.
3) People can chargeback with paypal. Bitcoin gives the seller the peace of mind knowing the transaction is non-reversible. Parking, especially in the city, can get quite expensive, and this risk is not negligible.

I agree 100% with this post. I've been working tirelessly on a few decentralized projects using Florincoin, which hosts 140 character messages in each transaction. The idea is similar to Namecoin except any application can be built upon the blockchain, not just domain name registry. This preserves Bitcoin's pure store-of-value system while using the blockchain functionality for other applications stored in a separate chain. Those who don't wish for Bitcoin's chain to be polluted with non-transactional data can agree to use this chain for storing their information, much like those who support Namecoin's domain name registry will mine and store the Namecoin blockchain on their computer.
I hope to eventually build a decentralized hashed contract ledger as well as some decentralized games on the Florincoin blockchain.

@_date: 2013-10-09 06:41:59
Currently I'm working on an implementation of this idea in the Florincoin blockchain.
Since Florincoin allows you to store 140 character messages in the blockchain, any company can easily prove they are the owner of a color coin by signing a message with the Florin address they use as the origination of their new color coin.
Additionally, since the Florin blockchain stores this additional data, the origination of the color coin itself is stored in the blockchain and doesn't need a centralized authority or separate software to hold that data in it. The blockchain "knows" where and when new coins were created.
You can read more in my post [here]( which includes a link to my site as well as the whitepaper. My site currently pulls data live from the blockchain and you can try it yourself by downloading a Florincoin client and writing a transaction that fits the specification into the blockchain.

Hi everyone,
I've noticed a lot of comments in this thread promoting the use of an alt-chain for the purpose of storing this type of data in a blockchain. 
If you aren't aware a new Litecoin clone (Florincoin) has a 140 character message included as an optional parameter in each transaction.
I'm starting to use this coin to build decentralized systems using the 140 character field.  You can see the beta of my first implementation here:  - this is a simple implementation of trading color coins using an account-based protocol in Florincoin. The entire site is pulled from live blockchain data (technically it is cached in MySQL, but the SQL database is pulled from the blockchain therefore it is possible to have a RPC-only florincoind site running 100% from the blockchain, though it will be far slower than using a database cache).
Purposes such as proof-of-existence will be featured on my next site (flonotes.com) which I am releasing on December 1st.
I believe using an alt-chain specifically for the purpose of decentralized applications is advantageous because it uses the Bitcoin protocol and technology while preserving Bitcoin's use as a pure store of value. Other coins and their blockchains can be used as a hybrid store-of-value and store-of-information ledger. Sort of like Namecoin.
Stay tuned!

A) You aren't "throwing out" any Bitcoin when you pay a transaction fee, those fees go to the miners! It is certainly a loss, but then again, you don't **have** to pay a fee. It's suggested and enforced by most miners for now because otherwise spam attacks would destroy the network.
B) Anyone can alter the code, but if you change the code in a way that the database of transactions is altered, you won't be able to send any transactions to the network because everyone else will not accept your broadcasts as valid. This is called a "hard fork". The beauty of Bitcoin is that anyone can modify the code, but only nodes running that ***exact*** version of the software can communicate with you. The network is held together by consensus.

This is the obvious next step for bitcoin. Could I subscribe to a mailing list of some sort? Do you have a website or kickstarter? Are you taking investors at this time?

There is no such thing as "splitting" Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot be created other than the process of mining, which is a predictable process that will create 21 million Bitcoins in total.
Hypothetically in the best-case scenario of everyone in the world using Bitcoin: Each person can hold 0.00003 Bitcoin and that could be worth something like $10,000. This is possible because a Bitcoin can be divided down to 1/100,000,000 or 0.00000001 which is known as a Satoshi. It's very possible that each Satoshi, in the future, can be worth as much as one cent.

The real reason many wish for Bitcoin to be accepted by Steam has more to do with the effect of bringing Bitcoin into the public eye.
At this point those savvy enough to have Bitcoins already could spend them on almost anything with a vast amount of services doing the conversion for you.
Eliminating that conversion is the goal.

Thank you for the clarification. I'm assuming to buy direct stock, you must purchase a much larger amount?

All of those problems can be solved quickly and easily by programmers at very little cost to your BTC wallet, maybe even free if you find the right guy/gal.

I'm also pretty certain that Mastercoin requires the destruction of Bitcoins since it uses the commit coin protocol to store information in the blockchain (2 strikes already)!

That process involves too many different "companies" to trust and too many steps (i.e. points of failure), plus BTC-E in itself is a sketchy site.

Reading this made me genuinely happy. I'm glad for your good fortune, and please remember to have a backup in the future! Also don't spend it all in one place. hahaa

What's your proposed solution?

eBay / Paypal knows that bitcoin is  the biggest threat to their service. There is no need for Paypal to exist if everyone uses bitcoin for transactions. Bitcoin completely cuts out the middleman and directly reduces the demand for payment processing services in the realm of money transmitting businesses.

Hi, check out my site  (zero javascript on this site btw)
This implementation works 100%, but it doesn't specify whether or not your account actually has enough balance to spend the coins you sent yet. Though that's a simple summation equation, it depends on the user's choice of confirmations to accept. 
I couldn't work on this for the past week due to bitcointalk.org being down and some other extenuating circumstances but if you want a beta account or you want to look at the code PM me. It'll be open source as soon as possible, and if you want to read the specification please check out the first draft of my white paper: 
PS you can try putting some transactions into the blockchain yourself to see that it works, but there recently was a huge 700 MH/s or so miner on the network who left us with a crazy high difficulty so the blocks are not being generated very fast right now. I'll actually give +5 FLO for every block to everyone who mines a block for the next month (up to 100,000 FLO) if they dedicate their miners towards FLO right now for the next month.

No. Bitinstant has complied with the FinCEN regulations and as far as we know, is operating legally, unlike Mt. Gox.

If you do implement ajax calls, please make a version that detects if javascript is enabled in browsers and redirects to a non-js version (such as the site you have right now, which is awesome btw). It would be foolish for anyone here to go to an unknown and new site without javascript disabled, and personally I use no-script to block all scripts when exploring new websites such as this.
