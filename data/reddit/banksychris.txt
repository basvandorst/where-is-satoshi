You've already waited 2 years, surely you can wait 2 more?

When do you see it reaching the 6 figure mark? 2022?

So fucking true, crypto Youtube is cancer. Clueless plebs like Crypto Wendy thinking they’re ‘blockchain experts’, roping newbies in to shitcoins and scams. Truly is the blind leading the blind.
It'll be such a bullish signal when these crypto ‘influencers’ capitulate and rage quit.

Do you even brain damage bro?

Very interesting. You mentioned the anomaly build from hype and  ICOs, do you think that phase plus the FOMO it brought is behind us for good?
Do you think in order for the crypto market to rise again to new heights, there needs to be a prolonged bear market so that the 2018 losses retail investor endured become a distant memory in their minds?

Bit random but can you tell us more about your experience during 2015? 
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:54:46
Thanks for responding. Would be really cool if we could get a AMA from the bitcoiners of 2015. I'd love to hear more about how things were back then in comparison to now.

no no no... not the ones on reddit, they ALL perfectly sell the top and buy the bottom.

Congrats man, keep it safe.
Don't be like me, I use to have lots of bitcoins but then I lost them all in a boating accident last year

Lost them just before the end of September, gutted!
