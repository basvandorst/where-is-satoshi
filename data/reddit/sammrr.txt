Ironically, radio frequencies are one of the most highly regulated resources - it's a better definition of a country's border than any wall or fence.
Most countries have free-to-use bands, but these end up being subject to the tragedy of the commons. If you and your friends can get some value out of setting up a mesh network, then chances are, a company with more money and stronger radios will use that same spectrum to link their sites together.

Consistently generating &gt;51% of the hashes is not the same as having 51% of the hash power. With the variance of hashing, 51% isn't enough to consistently generate &gt;51% of the blocks for a whole day - the more you are above 51%, the longer you can expect to consistently generate the majority of the blocks - even if you have 49% of the hash power, you can still generate the majority of the blocks for a few hours at a time (a few times over a month).
So as I said, there's no magical line at 50%, 49% is only slightly less dangerous than 51%, and people should get worried when a pool has 10-20% of the hashpower, not only when it gets close to 51%.

I waited nearly an hour for a block yesterday, it's actually quite common. Generally if you want to know how long 12 blocks will take it's much more often closer to an hour.
As for the upper bound, there's a bunch of stats that I'm out of practise with, but you generally pick a number (like 1 in a million) and find the gap between blocks that has that probability. It's a standard poisson distribution with an average of 10 minutes, have a play on wolfram alpha if you're curious.
Remember there's a possibility of two people selecting the same private key, but that is fairly safe to describe as "impossible" due to the probability being below a certain threshold (i.e. there should be N many earth-destroying asteroids before it happens)

The best and worst thing about open source is that it's totally up to you to contribute extensive time or cash to help.

This is a bad analogy. You aren't proposing we forcibly take the mtgox coins away from them and then spend them elsewhere, you're saying that everyone should refuse to accept them as tender.
You're also forgetting that these coins have quite likely been sold to other people. What happens to BTC if some of your coins just disappear from time to time because they had been traced to crime in the past? Do you have any idea how many US dollar bills have traces of cocaine on them, and what would happen if you tried to confiscate each one just because they had been used in a crime before?

The infographic is bullshit where it says "bitcoin hovered under $10 for its first four years" - tell me which part of this graph has bitcoin "hovering" in the $5-$10 range (hint: it's slightly less than a four year period).
The 1 year rise from 10 cents to 10 dollars is exactly the same scale as the rise from 10 dollars to 1000 dollars - bitcoin didn't sit stable at $8 for 4 years, it's been doing the same cycle the entire time.

The original cost money. The people who made the original likely want to earn more money than the original cost to make. The copies are free though - there is no difference in cost for 1 copy or 1,000,000,000 copies.
For historical reasons, people expect to be able to charge 10's of dollars for official copies (because unofficial copies were so difficult to make), but now there is no value in buying an official copies. Content creators need to find new avenues (subscriptions like spotify and netflix, convenience and library management like steam, origin, battle.net), but this is their problem if they can't find a value proposition that makes sense in the 21st century.

Sorry dude, but radio bandwidth is defined by physics - bandwidth = the width of the band, in other words, the amount of contiguous radio spectrum.
The throughput in a given bandwidth is also restricted by physics. Radio engineers talk about Signal to Noise Ratios (SNR), and while with a high enough SNR, you can get pretty good data density (16QAM and 64QAM let you get 4-6 bits per second for every Hz of bandwidth), the really hard part is trying to get the noise floor down low enough to make use of it.
You mentioned that MIMO can reduce the overlap between signals, but this isn't quite true either. MIMO is very useful for lowering the noise floor, but it can't work miracles, and it only helps deal with background noise and noise on surrounding frequencies - it will not help you compete with another signal on the same frequency.
tl:dr: if you want high data throughput, 100MHz of spectrum can get you in the order of 100Mb/s of throughput, but only if nobody else is making any noise, and especially not if someone else is using that frequency.

The rest of the world ended the gold standard near the end of the great depression. The US didn't end the tie to gold until 1971, but they did nationalise all gold and assert the right to set the price of gold in USD in 1934, which meant it was no longer a proper gold standard.

This is flawed thinking. You should conduct your affairs under the assumption that the network is owned at all times. This is why DNSSEC, SSL, PGP keys for wallet installs etc are vital.
You'd be amazed how easy it is to break into the bulk of WPA networks, or to redirect traffic on a wired network. Fibre optic networks can be sniffed by bending the fibre (light leaks out in a tight bend), and if someone really wants to they can easily put a switch in the middle of a copper cable (admittedly with a short outage) and capture the traffic that way.

Actually the exact opposite is true. The banks absorb fees by charging 5-10% transaction fees to retailers who then hide the cost in the price of what you're buying. Xapo is like bitcoin in that you see all the fees up front, and the retailer gets everything you send. Xapo is being transparent about what things actually cost, that's much better than them stealing money from you silently like the banks do all the time.

If you live in a geologically active area (South America, New Zealand, Japan), then you have something like a 0.0001% chance of there being an earthquake tomorrow that destroys your city. You have a 0.000000001% chance of rolling the same seed as someone else - in other words, 1,000 city-destroying earthquakes is more likely than you rolling the same seed.
In other words, "These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow.

Bitcoin ETF
What it is: An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a security entitling you to a stake in an asset, be it property, groups of shares (e.g. S&amp;P500), that would otherwise be difficult for you to buy. For example, it would cost you over $100,000 to buy shares in all 500 S&amp;P500 companies, but you could spend $100 on a share in an ETF that holds a proportion of all of them, and benefit in the same way
Why it is useful: Bitcoin is difficult to own - people post here all the time about their BTC getting lost or stolen. If you have shares in a BTC ETF, you outsource the requirement to know or care about bitcoin storage, but gives you the benefits of an investment in BTC
Why you should care: Non-technical people can speculate on the price of BTC, raising the demand and price, and making it more socially acceptable as an investment.

We can argue terminology if we must, my point is that conservative investors use the terms "investment" and "speculation" to refer to different classes of investment. Typically speculations have very high variance (the stats definition) in their rate of return, whereas investments have a much lower variance, and fundamentals that can support this.
It's not that bitcoin/gold/tulips are bad or unprofitable, it's just that there aren't measurable fundamentals that translate into market price. Shares/bonds/property on the other hand produce income as dividends/interest/rent, and the expected value can be calculated as a multiple of this

"Risk" is often defined in relation to variance or standard deviation. If the average return is 5% for two investments, but one has a standard deviation of 1%, and the other has a standard deviation of 2%, then the second is higher risk.

* you authorise each transaction, you never have to trust someone else to charge you the correct amount
* minimal fees - the "rewards" you get are a fraction of the fees they steal from you in the first place, and more people buying with lower fees = shops can charge lower prices
* lack of buyer protection (i.e. the ability to retract a payment on a whim instead of going through a court of law) means less risk for suppliers = less cost for reserves = lower prices for the customer

Paypal has a vested interest in people continuing to make payments with them, so they can never be totally impartial.
There's nothing stopping people agreeing in advance to go to arbitration with a neutral third party if a deal turns sour - once the arbitrator has made its decision, and this can result in an order to Paypal to reverse a transaction.

The proof of work concept means that it is prohibiltively expensive to revoke a transaction, meaning if someone signs and broadcasts a message saying they give something to someone else, then once it's in the blockchain, it's irrevocably been given.
Bitcoins are synonymous with the blockchain because those that perform the proof of work need to be compensated with something of value, and it only makes sense that they are compensated with the currency defined by the blockchain that regulates this species of transactions

So how many dollars is this worth? For comparison, if I had a shop that gave me a guaranteed profit of $1000 per year, then its value could be objectively measured in the ballpark of $10k-$20k (return of 5%-10% per year). Bitcoin cannot be measured like this. It definitely has "value", but this could be $1 or $1,000,000, and until you can objectively decide which is correct, bitcoin will remain a speculative investment

The important thing to remember is that bitcoin is massively volatile. I would assume the use case would be somebody coming along to buy a few BTC either to keep or to spend that night at a bar/restaurant.
If they're buying to keep, then a 5% fee is going to be a drop in the ocean. If they're buying for that night/day, they're saving the business they spend at the equivalent 5% VI$A/Ma$tercard fee, so they should eventually be getting discounts for BTC.
Going the other way, they've held and they're trying to get out (drop in the ocean). 5% is totally fine.

This is often overlooked - if you generate a brand new address for every transaction, then your transaction database can just refer to that address. No need to chase down missing funds in an account when you already have a list of every transaction that you expect and the money associated with it.

Most people seem driven by emotion - if something feels wrong or good then they'll respond that way. Look at xapo - everyone pays their transaction fees up front, and people are incredibly upset at xapo - not at their banks, for paying them minimal interest and hiding fees in various other places.
The rule of thumb seems to be that it's all about appearances - as long as you're more convenient than everyone else, then using a huge spread or building in fees somewhere will keep people happy, and being up front about adding % here and there will drive them away.

The difficulty increase should match the hashrate increase. If the hashrate doubles, you should expect blocks every 5 minutes until the retarget (which would *then* double difficulty). Just after the retarget is where the block average should be closest to 10 minutes
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:20:54
no no no no no
if this ever happens for a good reason, it'll happen many more times afterwards, but for bad reasons. miners MUST remain neutral, and BTC transactions MUST be 100% uncensored
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:17:49
If all of the miners agree then they can block transactions. But the reason everyone gets upset whenever a mining pool gets near 50% hashrate is because we want to minimise the possibility of this happening, among other things.
It's not really a technical thing as much as it is a psychology/gametheory/ideological thing. This is also a possible explanation for why the miner fees were so high on this transaction - even if some of the bigger pools wanted to block the transaction, smaller pools wouldn't want to pass up a 1BTC fee.
Conversely if someone like GAWminers gets 60% of the hashrate, they might to asshole stuff like mandating stupidly high transaction fees for certain people (competitors etc) - with decentralised mining, transaction fees and the like are a race to the bottom

It's a currency, not a meal ticket. If you were expecting an early investment + miners to generate perpetual income then this isn't a surprise.

more nicely put: the lure of being able to mine bitcoins, effectively generating free money out of thin air, is too good to be true. early adopters got lucky as a speculation, but this is not a sensible investment or career alternative

Pretty much. Bitcoin is a neat technology, but at the end of the day it's another currency and is used in exactly the same way - it makes it easier to get paid by people who can't physically hand you a banknote, but it isn't a magical way to make money for nothing.

Me too. I'd love a world where coders had free time to give to projects, but unfortunately open source has to compete against well-funded closed source.
The good news is that you *can* help - contributing financially to open source helps level the playing field. By giving open source developers money, they can spend less time working for someone else, and more time developing code that helps the community, not some rich dude in a high rise building.

Buffett doesn't like bitcoin because it's new and can't be valued. Read any of his old shareholder letters, read any of Ben Graham's (Buffett's mentor) work, their whole investment mentality is about buying boring, stable, and easily-valued companies. They also write a lot about why precious metals and forex are bad investments.
Buffett not investing in bitcoin has *nothing* to do with any of his current stock investments.

This is the first rule of investing - pick a plan and stick to it. People who speculate on oil/gold/metal and growth stocks should invest in bitcoin.

Who are the circlejerkers downvoting me? It's entirely different to piracy - pirated media runs perfectly in your home with zero outside interaction, whereas bitcoin needs an ecosystem of people to have any value.
If bitpay and coinbase were told by the US government that they had to shut down, you'd easily lose 99% of bitcoin-accepting businesses. Piracy has been illegal the entire time and works because pirated media works perfectly in your own house - bitcoin has been de-facto legal everywhere and only now are countries banning it.

Read a bit more. Words like "bubble" and "correction" are just trader alchemy that doesn't mean anything if you ignore the fundamentals.
The fundamentals of bitcoin is that the market cap should have some relation on the volume of transactions that use bitcoin. If there is $1 billion/time-period in transactions made with bitcoin, and that increases to $10 billion/time-period, then the fundamentals of bitcoin support it increasing tenfold

I'd be honestly worried if he did - Buffett only invests in income-producing assets that he can get at a discount, such that if the market is screwed for 5 years he can still profit off the company growing.
Buffett isn't interested in bitcoin for the same reason he isn't interested in gold or silver - its value is entirely defined by the whims of the market, and that isn't how he rolls.

I bought Age of Empires for $100 when it came out, and thoroughly enjoyed it. A few years later, Nutri-Grain had a promotion where each box of cereal had a free game with it - Age of Empires being one of them. How did I feel finding my $100 game showing up a few years later in a $2 box of cereal?
Fine, actually - I'd had a few years of good gameplay out of it and had moved onto other games by then. If I'd sat on my money it would have bought 50 packs of cereal = 50 copies, but this is just how deflationary markets work.

tl;dr don't worry this is all normal
Bitcoin-qt takes a couple of days to sync the first time. Also your wallet will end up with hundreds of addresses - incoming addresses let you know who has paid you, and when you send payments your wallet creates more addresses to send coins to (back to itself) to help anonymise your coins. It's all fine, and once your wallet is synced your total BTC is the main thing that matters

To have the same odds as winning the lottery, someone would need to generate something on the order of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 keypairs - and even then, they'd probably only find two of their own keypairs that have the same address, rather than finding anybody else's wallet

This is only necessary in the interim until your landlord and suppliers accept bitcoin (if you're in the US you may be in a state where you can pay utility bills in BTC  but as more and more people accept bitcoin, more and more people can hold onto it and circulate it properly without having to change to/from USD all the time

The best countries in the world to live in are all socialist (scandinavia), so the facts show that socialism isn't a bad thing.
The big advantage of a deflationary currency is that govts can't inflate their way out of trouble - they have to explicitly tax people, which makes them see what's happening, instead of secretly stealing their money in the background with inflation

And to completely contradict my earlier post - we should see a roughly linear trend on the log scale, and we look quite a bit below where we should be - *potentially* this means we're overdue for a jump up to $300-$400 territory, and the momentum of this could push it up to a premature $800 or even higher

@_date: 2013-04-30 09:35:47
That's my point - BTC is a risky investment. There's no guarantee that they'll go up, so it's best to only have 10% in BTC, and have the rest in more conventional assets - if $20k is a huge amount of money for you, then you'll likely appreciate the idea to keep $18k in a safer fund - the $2k could go up 10x, or it could go down to 0x, but it prevents you from losing it all

It's up to what miners accept. If a big enough chunk of the miners make it clear what transaction fees they accept (say 0.05c each, or 0.01% etc) then you have a fairly high chance of your transaction being accepted within a few blocks if you pay the fee that they ask for

I recommend Benjamin Graham's "The Intelligent Investor". It's a bit dry, but everything in it is backed by trends in 30-50 year datasets.
The short answer is that you never pick the top and the bottom of each peak and trough, so if it goes from $50 to $100 and you trade the whole way, you're paying 1% per trade and not getting all the peaks - compare that to the straight 100% gain you get from buying and holding

A quart of milk costs $4 because X americans have Y dollars each and drink Z quarts of milk every year, and the farmers have W dollars of bills to pay every year. This is always going to be some fraction of the total money supply, and as long as everyone is drinking the same amount of milk, and it takes the farmers the same amount of stuff that takes the same amount of effort to produce, a quart of milk is always going to be about the same percentage of the total money supply. As more money is printed, a quart of milk goes from $4 to $8.
The difference with bitcoin is that there are a limited number of things that you can buy, and a limited number of people buying them. As both of these things increase, the price of each thing is going to be a smaller percentage of the bitcoin supply, and since the bitcoin supply is fixed at 21 million BTC, the price of everything in BTC has to get cheaper. A quart of milk cost 0.4 BTC a few weeks back when 1BTC = $10USD, and now it costs 0.04BTC because presumably the combination of the # of people with bitcoins and the # of things that they are spending them on has gone up 10-fold - this seems entirely likely.

QE3 was announced on 13 September 2012. In an 11-to-1 vote, the Federal Reserve decided to launch a new $40 billion a month, open-ended, bond purchasing program of agency mortgage-backed securities and also to continue extremely low rates policy until at least mid-2015.[65] According to NASDAQ.com, this is effectively a stimulus program which allows the Federal Reserve to relieve $40 billion dollars per month of commercial housing market debt risk.[66]
On 12 December 2012. The FOMC announced increased the amount of open-ended purchases from $40 billion to $85 billion per month. This is sometimes referred to as "QE4"
$85 billion out of $1.1 trillion = 7.7%

Depends what you value bitcoin at. If you think it's going to go down permanently, don't buy. If you think it's going to fluctuate around the current price for ages, then buy as many as you want to spend. If you think the price is going to go up long term, then buy and hold. There's no "good" time.

$20k isn't a huge amount of money, but it is if it's only invested in a single asset class.
I'd recommend keeping your cryptocoin/metal holdings to less than 10% of your entire portfolio, and diversify the rest over some bonds and shares (ideally bond funds and an S&amp;P500 tracker fund if you're not going to study them too hard)

If you want to profit from wide fluctuations then buy some BTC (4 for example), set yourself an interval ($20 or $50 or $100), and then whenever BTC goes down by your interval double your BTC, and then when it comes back up by that interval halve it again - if bitcoin stays within a given range then you'll make money from the volatility

The more important question is, why do governments regularly print money? They do this as a silent tax - if the money supply increases by 10%, everyone's money is worth 10% less, so this essentially imposes a 10% wealth tax across the board.
As you see in Cyprus, they can't print more Euro so they have to accomplish this by directly taxing bank deposits. Bernanke printing money through QE is identical to the Cyprus deposit taxes, except with a better PR campaign

The answer is yes. As the market becomes more popular, any manipulatable trends become commonplace so they lose their advantage.

Uh, so what if you're a US citizen in another country, do you need to pay tax every time the USD drops since you hold foreign currency? The whole thing sounds like total horse shit and impossible to enforce if the IRS are going to chase you down every time currencies change because of the fed printing too much.
For example, let's say you had a Canadian currency account with $4,000 worth of USD in it in 2009 (about $5,000 CAD) ready to go on holiday, but then didn't ( - you'd now still have your $5,000 CAD, but you're expected to pay tax on $1,000 of it because the USD has dropped?

A market is always going to be irrational. Markets for bonds and shares at least have fundamentals that people can base their valuations on, but even those have irrational bubbles and dips that can persist for years at a time.
The only numbers that bitcoin really has as fundamentals are those that people derive of whatever percentage of the money supply that bitcoin might replace, but they're all just guesses. It's therefore like gold or silver, but much more thinly traded, so a big trade (possibly lots of holders cashing out) can swing the price hugely
