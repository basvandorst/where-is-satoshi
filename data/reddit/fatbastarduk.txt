Buenos Aires seems to have the highest ratio of Bitcoin merchants to population on Coinmap.org. Vancouver is another hot spot.

Its interesting to consider that Bitcoin's current market cap of $10B divided by the 2,760 venues on coinmap that take bitcoin = $3.6 million per venue!! Obviously this doesn't take in Bitcoin's many other financial uses, but still indicates how much speculation is driving current pricing.

During the soviet dictatorship, foreign goods were banned but you could buy them illicitly everywhere. It was a running joke. I doubt the Putin dictatorship will have any better luck at banning Bitcoin. Should be an interesting match-up!

Its hard to say. One possible metric is the number of people subscribing to the Bitcoin sub-reddit. Its definitely grown more quickly over the past week than previous weeks, but not a dramatic rise. It probably will take a few months to know if its the first bitcoin killer app or not.

Japan has not been a significant factor in terms of bitcoin adoption. Surprisingly insignificant for the worlds's 3rd largest economy. I read somewhere on this subreddit it has to do with their conservative society and very modern banking system.
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:29:33
Yes I think you might be right. Perhaps its just semantics but iI do believe that the quantitative evidence points to a likely rise in price over the summer, and this is in part a function of the network effect. Whether its a bubble or not is impossible to know, as Faggart says.

My fear is Counterparty piggybacks on Bitcoin until they have sufficient brand recognition to do what they do with their own alt currency which is way cheaper than bitcoin. Then they detach and say "thanks for the ride, we'll take it from here". By stealing Ethereum's code (lets call a spade a spade) they revealed their lack of ethics.

That's the last time I give a fuck when that guy says he has a big announcement.
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:17:09
If you track the last couple of years of data, the price has grown an average of about 0.62% a day. That puts the current trend price at about $620, and at this rate it should be $4,000 by the end of the year. So holding at $680, well ahead of the trend, isn't a bad spot to be.
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:43:51

You also have to email them after to confirm the deposit, at least the first time you deposit, not after.

You have to go to a BMO branch to deposit.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:43:10
I have a CIBC account. I went there and got a bank cheque made out in US Dollars. I then went to BMO and they deposited the cheque directly into the VaultofSatoshi account. The first time took about 16 hours to verify the funds were there (after I emailed them, as per the instructions on the web site). Then you are free to buy bitcoin or litecoin on their exchange. The second time I deposited funds was the same process but they recognized the deposit within an hour or so.
