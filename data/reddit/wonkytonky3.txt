i may or may not have spoken to lawyers before :)

I imagine if coins was stolen out of margin positions.. they would be automatically margin called right?.. so if everything looked ok just before bfx halted everything..  that margin position should (normaly) not be affected      right?

well.. what if they find an investor.. and those bfxcoins have actual 1$ vallue?   or if bfx makes enough profit and pay some divident on them or something?..   i'd not dismiss the value of them too early.    I know we are highly emotional . ;but it could have turned out much worse..   
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:24:28
yes .. if they use other currencies as colateral damage.; we don't know how they will address that..   although i think it's gonne be only btc and usd used in lending if coins are stolen used in margin position.. but thats just me thinking out loud of what i've read so far. We will just have to wait for their public anouncement

this is bitcoin.. one does not simply date..           period :)

just ask for bfx to make them able to withdraw before trading starts..  thats should give you freedom
@_date: 2016-08-10 00:58:27
until you have to  sell it. then you crash market to 1$ :)
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:21:40
well then take the slower withdraw :) it's not going to matter.. the fee is just the banking system working faster.. it's not going to make bfx making the withdraw faster.

agreed well something doesnt add up.   imagine : you have 5btc   and you lend an other 10btc: thats  6000usd loaned.    now they are gonne say: those 10btc are stolen so they cannot pay back the usd so the usd is affected. This is false. USD is still there but now finex has an extra 6000$  .The stolen coins are gone anyways. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:08:58
it's not going to change anything..  
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:28:53
the orderbooks will probably be empty.. i'd not worry to much about this..   unless they have a market maker on board to fill it..   
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:34:11


yep.. i'll stay customer too.. but need to see how security works.. and i can only agree to 1 thing: cold storage with a hot wallet less then 1000coins..  i rather have them lock my coins 24h and manual process withdraws ..   then to have any sort of automation because anything automated = hackable in the end somehow
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:19:03
imagine those bfx tokens getting a pump to 1$+ :) there's your crowdfund
@_date: 2016-08-13 02:02:58
 there a lot of : you "may" .. this or "may" that.;   they know the money is taken out already..   so there's no point.. but still want to make a quick buck on it.. ...   snake oil lawyers  lol 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:44:14
i have an email i only use for bfx.. and i got this mail. 
edit: my other email adresses i used for bot acounts etc didnt get the mail.. so not all mail are out there
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:18:44
will fees be the same on usd withdraws etc ? 
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:13:32
he said 2h before trading starts.; we will know ;) 
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:17:39
fyi clef works fine here, also sms and 2fa google authenticator. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:51:11


he doesnt know anything about those things unti they know how they gonne resolve the loses..  so far as i know..  but stated he will have some info on that somewhere in the next day(s)
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:24:18
could btc that was used in a  a margin trade..    be stolen aswell.. so if it was "not available" for trading..   ?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:59:49
no usd was stolen either... believe me  this is better then liquidation due to bankruptcy and no chance of seeing your money  in 5 years .. and probably lots of court and lawyer costs that eat it all 
@_date: 2017-02-20 18:51:12
market makers aren't a good thing for you little traders :) 
@_date: 2017-02-07 11:29:01
