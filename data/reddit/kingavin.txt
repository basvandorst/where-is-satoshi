No one is willing to buy in a bear market, bear market ends when no one is willing to selling. lower volume is a good thing.

I am sure there are local Canadian exchanges, even Africa has lots of exchanges. 
the only country that doesn't have a proper exchange is China...

even though they have btc LOGO (thanks a lot),
I would still bet on liquid...

1 mining pool gethers miner's hashing power to mine btc
2 miner's hash power could switch to other mining pool easily
3 if bitmain attacks btc, all its mining gears will be waste ( btc price drop -&gt; miners quit mining)
4 bitmain holds 30K of btc, would it attack it self?

first you need a vpn
Coincola, huobi pro , gate.io i think those exchange websites provide otc trading, you can start with small money and give it a try 
Remember Always withdraw your fund, they may be goon in a sunny morning and ruins your day.

is it time to dump now?
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:26:18
68 sats
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:18:07
We also have liquid network as a second layer, maybe we will never have to increase the block size.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:15:54
Is it related to the amount I sent? 39 aud is a big amount I suppose?
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:25:31
I opened the channel last night, with the default node provided by eclair wallet. It took around 2 hours, mostly depending on the tx fee you are willing to spend.
Paying the merchant through the channel was almost instance. And the fee was 68 sats.

No. However, You can refill it, but it requires a service called Watch Tower to makes sure your fund not stolen by the other party. 
Unfortunately, that service hasn't been implemented for now.

Paid for a kitty card game, the shop is MIND GAMES in Swonston ST in Melbourne cbd
And the service is superior!!!
@_date: 2018-11-10 13:41:09
bear trapped. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:41:14
I think watch tower is for monitoring the channel and notify you if older transaction signature is broadcasted by your peer?
Since refill is not allowed (with my wallet), there would be no reason for my peer to broadcast old transaction state.
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:11:05
Looks like they are using a payment processor, Coingate
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:47:06
Why would it be bad? Are you the owner of the shop? ����
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:57:17
I could be the new pizza guy. :)
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:39:07
credit card usually change the merchant 2% plus 30 cents per transaction.
Lighting charges less than a penny.
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:18:53
Paid a visit to the shop today, and bought with lighting. Fantastic!
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:42:39
�� didn't realize that. First time user
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:07:16
You just need to setup the channel once to pay all the merchants that accepts lighting. But after the funds in the channel are all used, you will need to open another one.
The mobile wallet doesn't allow refill, so channel has to be closed after funds are depleted.

May he has an anonymous account 
 with thousands of coins to spend. (Not the original one, any movement on that could be tracked down)

just like what happened when China baned bitcoin exchange in September, price dropped 50% and bounced back within one month
