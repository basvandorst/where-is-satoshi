When the older generations eventually die, there will only be bitcoin.

I love bitcoin but this shit is what is reking new comers and turning off potential adoption.

I’m referring to the question being asked not his response.
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:14:44
Do elaborate.
@_date: 2019-08-25 12:02:35
That was exactly my thinking..  I was happy to throw away $100 on alcohol every so often knowing I won’t get a return.  Why not instead of that nice bottle of whisky put it in BTC..  who knows in 10 years time I might afford myself a whole distillery.
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:21:35
That’s bullshit!  Were you compromised via the ATM or what?  So sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2019-08-03 12:17:34

At 6:36 pm AEST on August 21st 2019 bitcoin will start its volcanic rise to the moon.
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:22:59
Oh my god bitcoin price fell again!  Who’d a thunk.
@_date: 2019-08-26 20:46:17
It’s pure math.

Jesus Christ..  Bitcoin does not equal drugs.  Sick of this argument.
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:23:27
BTCmarkets.com is works for me.  You send money to your account and buy various crypto.  You can also send and receive crypto to and from your btcmarket account
@_date: 2019-08-13 22:01:38
Oh there’s my wallet..  thank you, I lost access to that email many moons ago.  If you could just message me the info I’d be greatful.
Btw no need to verify my identity or whatever.

People in 1870 probably thought the idea of travelling around on anything other than horseback was stupid.

@_date: 2019-06-29 12:07:09
They freaked out, sold at a loss then killed them selves.
@_date: 2019-06-24 10:39:59
Cashing out.

Bitcoin is your bi-polar girlfriend close to that time of the month. Unpredictable.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:52:56
Is it not possible to sell for AUD in Australia.  An app or platform in which I can transfer my btc from Coinbase onwards to cash out.

@_date: 2019-06-23 23:14:07
For real.  Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2019-06-24 11:21:52
I agree completely.  When the time comes id like to be prepared!
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:53:27
Great advice.  I see people saying they jumped all in with all their savings.  You rarely see them posting again.
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:28:42
Just an example.  You could buy your BTC at 9000 and it drops below 9k and never rises.
@_date: 2019-09-02 02:11:18
You sir are brilliant.
@_date: 2019-09-15 21:31:37
I merely was saying 50 odd hours until BTC begins to skyrocket.  I never said it would reach happy highs over night.  It’s going to go up gradually from here on in.
@_date: 2019-09-14 23:35:28
What do you mean?  It’s already started.
@_date: 2019-09-12 21:44:13
Realisations of the current global fiat currencies.
New revelations.
Conputjng advancements.
Warm weather
And don’t forget about the FOMO.
@_date: 2019-09-12 13:29:57
sending your negativity out into the atmosphere will surely return you negativity.
@_date: 2019-09-12 21:42:28
Lol, yes I’m using the term broadly.
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:43:54
Me also, stock up while you can.
@_date: 2019-09-01 22:57:48
I will be hodling seminars this September and October.  Limited interest, seating unavailable.
Hit me up.
@_date: 2019-09-08 06:32:53
What happens if you sell at 9,9k then it jumps to 11k and doesn’t fall again.

Friend from the future, wishes to remain anonymous.
@_date: 2019-09-15 01:36:45
It’s a gradual process.
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:58:22
That’s true, I thought I had it figured out now you have me scratching my head yet again.
