Seconded. I dont plan to sell, do i still need to include my earnings on my taxes? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:18:26
Dont worry about it. We all get it. I bought in at 1300. Im very glad i did so. This isn't without regret though... My only regret is that i didn't buy more.
Buy as much now as you're comfortable buying. Keep an eye on the price of btc as long as you posses any coin. Hodl and keep buying what you're comfortable with buying.

You have a few options. Definitely get your coin out of coinbase asap. If you're using coinbase on your phone, what kind of phone do you have? If you're on Android, I would recommend Coinomi. I know someone with an iPhone who uses the blockchain app and likes it, bit i don't know too much about the wallet options other than that dor apple users. If you happen to be on Android, I use Coinomi and am very happy with it. Great dev support and it also supports other cryptos. If you have a desktop computer, consider getting bitcoin core or another desktop wallet. You can also get a hardware wallet. I actually just ordered my own today, I have a Ledger Nano S coming, it's gotten good responses in the community as a close contender to the Trezor.
Regardless of what you choose to do, get your money out of coinbase and into a wallet with your own private keys, write those keys down on paper and keep that sheet of physical paper in a very safe place where it won't be lost or stolen.

You gotta understand that this question has been asked at pretty much every point in btc's life in the past 5 or 6 months.
The answer is, and will always be no.

I sold about $65 last week. Is that enough to include?

I'd legit vote for this to be the anthem of hodl
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:21:32
Just keep a close eye on the price. It's currently as cheap as its been for the past week and a half or so, so personally, I would try to buy as soon as I can.

@_date: 2017-10-13 02:28:18

@_date: 2018-02-02 00:49:18
Absolutely

damn.. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:48:25
Thank you! 
When you say probably, what do you mean by that? What's the risk? Sorry if this is a stupid question.

So essentially im just making a transaction with myself, but between my coinbase and my wallet? How exactly do i do this? Sorry it's my first time with this an im just hesitant because i don't want to lose my coin! Do i go to "receive" on my wallet app? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:14:48
Right, I see. 
Mainly I'm just curious to see my old wallet (and start using it again). I may have bought some bitcoin way back then and forgotten about it. With all the hype happening right now around bitcoin I got excited! Not getting my hopes up, but a guy can dream. :) thanks for the help, I'm excited to join the community! 
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:42:16
My key is just my wallet bitcoin address, right? Is it being in a wallet (like bitpay or coinomi) safer than in the exchange (Coinbase) wallet?  
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:12:53
Looks like it's going to be available on the Apple app soon. Dang! [coinomi](

Hey, newb here too. I've learned a *ton* over the past week. Just keep reading. Watch YouTube vids. I wouldn't say I'm even close to considering myself "savvy" but it will start to make more sense. 
One thing: sounds like you're keeping your coin in the Coinbase wallet. You probably want to consider sending it over to a separate wallet with HD private keys. I started using Bitpay, then learned that they aren't on board with UASF and decided to leave them. Plus, I bought some Ether as well, (which you also may want to consider, mine's shot up about it seems like at least 5 dollars or so since i bought it, it also took off last week!) which they dont support. Anyways I did some research and saw that others here use the Coinomi app, which gives you complete control of your keys aka "hd private keys" which is a lot safer incase worst comes to worst. You can't depend on Coinbase to keep your funds safe as far as I can tell. I would recommend it! Very well put together app. And what I was getting at before about ethereum: coinomi is a multi coin wallet so you can buy a bunch of different alt coin besides bitcoin and have it all neatly organized in one app. It also has this thing powered by technology called "shapeshift.io" that allows you to easily exchange one currency/coin to another (i.e. buy x amount of ether for x amount of bitcoin, vice versa) which is pretty awesome. So yeah, look into a separate wallet. People are talking a lot about Electrum, Mycelium and Jaxx  too  if you want to look into other well-regarded options. 
Cheers!

Thanks for clearing that up for me! So currently I have some bitcoin and a bit of ethereum. I transferred my bitcoin to bitpay and have my ethereum in coinomi. Is coinomi "hd"? Id like all my coin in one app ideally... Something I read kept me from putting my bitcoin in coinomi, can't remember what. Which one of those is the most reputable? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:20:06
Interesting...seems like there is a decent amount of fud surrounding the whole thing...
