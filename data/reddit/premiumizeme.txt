Sure thing, I'll explain it for you.
* If you for example want to download content from a sharehoster (like Netload) but you only have a premium account from Uploaded, you have to purchase a premium account from Netload as well because, logically, your Uploaded login doesn't work with Netload. Our service takes effect now: If you buy for our service, you don't have those problems anymore! You don't need premium accounts for those sharehosters anymore because our service gives you automatically premium access to more than 20 sharehosters!
* If you live outside the U.S., you are not able to watch content on Hulu.com or Netflix, for example. If you live in Germany, you can basically not watch videos on YouTube, due to GEMA restrictions. But our service makes those things available for you: Due to our proxy network, you can watch your desired content on those sites although you don't live in the U.S.!
Those two great services and for only €10 (BTC 0.14) for 2 months! Try it out, you won't be disappointed!

Thanks! Well; not all our users cap out their traffic - making room for selling the overhead. So far we have been going strong for more than 2 years!

Yes that is our extension! After you added it to Chrome, click on our little premiumize man and login at the extension into your premiumize.me account. make sure you put it on auto mode. But it really is self explanatory
Yes you can download from Rapidgator right away; we have a fair use system and allows up to 220GB/ 7 days for downloading which is more than you get with pretty much any other filehoster.

We calculate traffic for the last 7 days; so if it is longer than 7 days ago it falls out of your fair use calculation. 
Example: download 100GB today and your remaining fair use quota will be 120GB insteand of 220. if you download 50GB tomorrow your remaining quota will be 70. on the coming sunday it will be 170GB again becasue the last sunday does not count into your quota anymore. I hope that explained it well.
