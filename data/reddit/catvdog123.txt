The problem is distribution with or without a key. 
Once you make a digital thing and copy it then send it to someone with a key to unlock it, the end user can duplicate it and send it to others with the key. As you make it harder and harder on the end user of your products, the end user finds another easy way to get that content if it is less of a hassle.
Some content creators try to use specific data from your hardware to lock it down but that can be spoofed. So then the chip makers colluded with them to store markers deep deep inside to ID you. This was cracked as well.
The move was to the cloud and keys were turned into subscriptions or ads, that too is not working as expected.
    
You have a unique ability to create content and instantly make 1 billion copies and distribute it to billions of people. At no point in history has this been the case, and its an amazingly powerful ability. Along with it comes a new challenge, how to be fairly compensated for your work in a global market with millions of competitors.

This is true. You were rewarded for the risk you took, you bought in got $100 which would be a profit of $100 after 1 entire month.
Those guys back in the day spent $500 on nerd money with no track record of anything, that was most likely stolen from them while on MtGox.
You could have bought 10 coins then with that 100 bucks but you scoffed at it then too.
 Then they shoveled more money back in and somehow refused to sell at $1000 and watched it slowly crash back to 150. 
Then sat there for 2 years waiting and waiting. Then it hit $1000 again and they held strong with their 1/2 million. Now a full year later they have 10 million and have to listen to you cry about investing $100 and only doubling it in a month.

All that said we still have to fund and settle LN channels.
So the bitcoins could technically never or rarely leave the channel and fiat could be used to buy into it. That would put a massive dent in the currency failure argument by becoming currency.
But if anyone wanted to fund and settle a channel using the main chain and only send 50 or 100 or even 200 it is a bad idea.
What you quickly end up with is a Coinbase LN with cash buy ins and a public ledger. You will have competing LN hubs which become the banks of the future but at least these new banks have transparency and can't print money. :)

If so you can't rely on other asset trading data (bitcoin trading data does not correlate well enough at all).

The max TX per year of 147 million on the main chain says otherwise.


I am in favor of off chain solutions and scaling solutions. That does not negate my factual claim that the loading and settlement would crush the main chain.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:22:20
What do you not get? This is basic basic math.
LN requires the user to at some point Load and Settle to use the LN.
So assume the only TX on the main chain was just those loads and settlements.
We have a max of 146 million TX per year on the main chain.
So 72 million total LN channels loaded and settled.
If we have 20 million users of bitcoin. They get to do this 3x each max per year. That does not explain how to get the bitcoins to use them, not account for mining which is also done on the main chain.
So now if we have 40 million users, they get 1 use cycle of a LN channel max.

They are multisig and bigger so no gain from segwit.
This is also assuming not a single non LN load/settle TX occurs on the main chain which is not the case, all mining happens on it. We might be able to allocate 1/2 of the bandwidth tops.
My contention is there is no room to do use the LN on the underlying tech so the LN will not save us.

The spam safety level increases with time. It used to be that 1 sat was sort of safe, now 10 is then 20 then 50 etc etc. They can continue to fill with no chance of a confirmation.

First step is to move the bitcoin into a new cold storage address.
Then go back and get the private keys from the sending address/addresses.
Get a wallet that enables those forked coins and import that private key into it.
Now use that wallet to send the coins to an exchange and swap the coins into Bitcoin, then send those coins to the cold storage wallet.

People still need to fund their LN accounts.
If they remove their bitcoins from the LN they are charged a fee again.
LN is fine but it does not fix loading or settlement, in fact if LN takes off and Bitcoin adoption continues to grow and grow, the fee problem will continue to get worse and worse.
No one has showed anyone a way out yet, besides the short term lame fix of upping the block size. We can't lower the block times without introducing risk.

How do people fund their channels and settle? Or do people but into LN side chains and never settle up? If so...the LN side chains are just fancy paypals that can be shut down by governments in an instant or -you- can be locked out by a government and the LN that you bought into with fiat would comply with the gov request (you would never even see your keys the LN would lend you credits for the coins tied to an account that they lend to you).

If I can download any app of my choosing that ties into the underlying ledger and click "delivery" and see the delivery people active, type a message and send it out to them all and then pick the one that responds to do the deal for cash or bitcoin via a LN channel, that is my ideal app. Then next time I simply open it and see they are active and I call him directly and don't even use the chain or app to do the deal.

They can if you buy into the channel with fiat and are given a token on an internal ledger backed by bitcoins. I contend people will end up choosing that due to the fees being too high to fund entry into the channel.
I seems counter intuitive that people will be tricked into thinking it is a good idea but millions will not have a choice.

Some channels could work like that unless you buy in with bitcoin.
I can see some sort of site growing by offering bitcoins as payment for services and keeping the coins in the LN off the main chain, then offering to settle in btc or cash.
Who knows what sort of off chain craziness is going to spring up. But imagine offering a chance to people to own bitcoins without buying or mining them, millions will jump at the chance.

My point is that it can't as designed.
Imagine us scaling up to a paltry 1 billion users of bitcoins.
No one makes a single TX on the block chain accept to load a LN channel and then to settle out of a channel (both of which are MultiSig TX so they take a little more bytes).
Lets assume they only do this once a year for some awesome reason.
Bitcoin can handles 5 TX per sec.
It will take 12 full years to confirm that...lets say 100 million users and only 2 on chain TX per year, that takes over a year.
So either, loading and settlement happens off chain (which it does not) or the number of users has to go down to under 1 million.

Mass adoption without long term mass scaling in place.
No coin can handle what is needed long term (5+ years out). 
The fees will come down a bit but within a couple years low fees on the main chain will not exists.
Fees will rise and rise on alt chains and or the altcoins will become so centralized that we might as well go back to normal banking with bankers being in 100% control of the money.

We are running out of fresh money to keep the buying streaks alive.
So any bad news can signal to new money to just wait and buy after the dust settles. 
This creates a negative feedback loop, the opposite of FOMO. The buyers not buying are being rewarded for waiting. The sellers panic as they figure this out and lower their prices. And down and down we go until we reach a balance. I think that balance is around 8000 now :(

I am trying to correct you.
The part about the LN being able to open/close 5 per second it not just wrong it has nothing to do with the failure point.
Focus on what matters.
147 million max on main chain TX per year. LN can do 100 billion or 77 trillion even, that part is great.
Imagine 40 million users of bitcoin. They want to load into the LN channel (1 TX on the bitcoin main chain) and then they use the LN 1 million times for shits and giggles all on the LN chain. Then they settle up (1 TX on the bitcoin main chain).
Thats 80 million TX on the main chain or half of the total capacity. If they happen to want to load and settle 2 times a year then the main chain is full.
What if we have only 147 million users...they can't use it at all.

Go the free route and make a cold storage wallet that is stored hidden at home and hidden at another home of a trusted person (tweak the key with a known tweak and note it on each of the other papers so you don't forget).
That way you have the private key in 2 places, each even if found will not be able to be unlocked.

People pay a ton of money for fake reputations on sites like Amazon. How you handle that will be of great interest because Amazon has largely failed.

* Download and open Open World app
* Pick the category and it shows how many Taskers are 'live' in your area
* Send out the task to one or all
* They respond and you pick the one you want
* They drive up, hand you the milk you hand them $8
    
This would be awesome and you and I would use it today this instant with no need to explain a thing to the users.
    
In this model the sellers would pay a small monthly fee to host their profile. $20 per month per seller is a metric shit ton of money when 10 million taskers pay that fee. So the buyer pays a tiny fraction of that fee maybe 1 to 3 pennies.
Why this needs a blockchain escapes me actually if reputations are not kept. This has been the basic idea I wanted to exist for years now.

Either we have overly regulated 'good' exchanges that take a ton of time because everyone wants to use them or we have MtGox and no one wants to use them.
IDs on a blockchain would solve this but then you need to REALLY protect your private keys lol good luck with that. That said I would prefer to be the one in charge of my ID instead of 1000 other companies that fucking SUCK at it.

Watched the video. I think the winner in this space will be a much more simple concept focused on trust and building an online reputation.
Anyone mining the chain would be able to use a mined coin to create a unique ID. Then buyers can rate the seller with their coins. When I say coins I do not mean coins of value at all, their would be 100s of billions of coins. 
The platform would not be used as a payment platform but simply a platform that anyone can join and become a buyer or seller of goods or services. The platforms API would be updated over time to add more and more base categories but custom categories could also be made.
     
The reason for a set of base cats is to allow for 3rd party sites to quickly set up a great UI tied into the chain and have it be easy to navigate.
    
I would simply love to be able to fire up an app, search my area for 'live' taskers, then send out a request for a 1/2 gallon of chocolate milk brought to my home with my bid of cost + $5 
    
The 7 live taskers would see the task and them 3 accept it, I get alerted and pick which one I want by glancing at their profiles and ratings. I select Tasker SlamDunk and it sends them my address. They go to the store, grab my drink, pull up tell the app they are here. I open the door hand then $8 and drink my milk in two gulps and give SlamDunk 5 stars.
That is the app I want.
    
SlamDunk pays the app / site devs a flat fee of $20 a month to list his profile and can charge him $100 to give him a Gold Start for being checked and cleared through a criminal database check.

The CBOE turned out to be a tiny tiny market of no significance. CME being 5x bigger will make 5x more of a tiny dent.

Just give them a certificate enabling them to redeem bitcoin at any time. The catch is they have to call you to use it is all.
You safely store all the coins and do not move ANY until someone wants them moved, saving the initial fees until the time you send them out. You then use that time to explain fees and confirmations and point them to a few AA videos IF they want to learn more.
If they want to sell, you could just hand them the current cash value and keep the coins :)

If it works anything like stock options then their are multiple contracts at various price points that expire on certain dates.
Those contracts rise and fall in value based 'mostly' on the price of bitcoin. So a 16k Jan 8 Contract may be worth a LOT more if the price spikes to 18k and the owner would sell the contract to the new buyer. Then lets say bitcoins took a shit down to 9k. Then that contract would be FAR out of the money and worth a shit ton less.
On expiration dates the contracts that hold value get settled at 2:30pm CST using a predetermined set of spot prices from various exchanges according to written criteria (no fee exchange prices would not be used as part of the spot pricing formula for instance).

They have portfolios, entire companies, multiple homes, large tracts of land, bonds, trusts, lawyers.

The next big challenge is going to be over centralization of mining and or government level mining by less than nice governments.
Not even sure a distributed network of volunteer miners (still paid but using costly GPUs in their PCs) could make a healthy dent.
I think a single AntMiner S9 is a million times better than a GPU miner (which sucks).
So maybe a cheap ASIC miner at around $20 on a USB stick that 1 million people plug and and run to participate in and keep the system legit would help. No idea.

Not positive that commodity futures work like stock options but stock options (contracts) work something like this.
They are a promise to buy or sell 100 units of stock at a specific price at a specific time in the future.
As the underlying stock price fluctuates the value of the contract reflects the new stock price.

A transaction is generally the movement of a coin or fraction of a coin from one location to another.
This movement is recorded on the chain in blocks of 1MB in total size.
Roughly every 10 minutes a block is added to the chain with those transactions in it.
3500ish per 10 mins.
The TX (transactions) have fees (small portions) attached and the miners choose which TXs get into the next block. They choose the ones with higher fees.
Right now if no one makes a new TX for the next 4 days then all the TXs will be completed.
It used to take under an hour then a few hours became the norm then 1/2 a day. Now fees keep rising to be able to have a decent chance to get a fast TX and the waits go up and up and up.
If you have $30 in bitcoin, you may never be able to move it due to the fees. If the fees become closer to $100 then you won't be able to spend or move that either.

The channel you have open needs to have the person you want to pay in that channel. Even if there was only 1 massive big LN channel with everyone in it, you could only load and settle 3-4 times a year max if we have 20 million bitcoin users. And no other TXs down on the network. 
The on and off ramp to the LN is my problem. Others say the LN itself can't even scale well enough when the numbers of users on a channel gets too big.

It would help by cutting down the numbers of transactions but not by a ton.
Also a competing exchange would simply hold out and allow any number sent in to have a leg up on the other guys even though it sucks for the customer.

My contention is that it will not work after a max of about 30-60 days. And won't work at all in 6 months because the fees for loads will be so high that only loads of $1000+ will make any economic sense. Wait a year and fees will crush LN before it gets into the wild.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:00:21
LN will not unclog the main chain, it is nearing max capacity and if the user base doubles it will be way way over max.

LN channels once loaded are supposed to handle a big enough portion of TXs that the main chain TXs will be fast and cheap again. I do not buy this story :( too many people want bitcoin and bitcoin with or without LN is not able to keep pace.

Imagine a billion people trying to open and settle just 3 different LN channels per year.
1 billion users (low estimate) so 6 billion TXs hitting the main chain not to mention all the other non LN TXs but lets pretend those no other TX are done.
That will take 472 YEARS to clear.
You would be dead before you could load any bitcoin onto the LN channel.
I fully understand once a channel is open its 'free' to use and awesome. We basically have that right now with private LN channels (they are called sql databases run by companies like Coinbase).
Even if we have 1 massive LN (which everyone uses) you still have to load and settle even once a year? Once a decade?

You still need to load (send) the LN channel with your bitcoins. LN will reduce the number of on chain TXs but as LN becomes popular it adds to adoption and more on chain TXs
The 1 MB block will never be able to handle the demand so fees will stay too high for a long time to come.
I suspect I will see 50-100 average fees for on chain TXs to become the norm within 60-90 days.
238,000 unconfirmed TXs which is an all time high.

You have much to learn.
The stolen coins were from a reseller of mining time. Someone got in and stole the keys to the coins kept on site OR an inside job and they said the coins were stolen.
    
The blockchain can track what addresses the coins went to but that is a new address with nothing tied to it ID wise.
    
The coins then continue to get churned and traded endlessly to the point that the trail is useless to ID the 'thief'
If the 'thief' is dumb they would take the stolen coins, xfer them to coinbase and cash out to their bank in the US :) lol

Right now it is a scarce resource with special properties with a substantial foundation of support built up around it. People are doing their best to make sure they get a little bit of it, just to make sure they spread their risk/reward around.

Imagine if we had all timed the swings in bitcoin this week. If I timed it even slightly right during 3-4 swings the gains in a 24 hour period in cash would have been sick. Instead I did nothing like a  chicken and stuck to my plan. I have a very exact plan for bitcoin too and am waiting to pounce to make my move to mitigate risk.

Was just picking at the wording.
A stock, bond, price of a house or a bitcoin does not "go down 20 times". No one would phrase it that way. They would say it fell 95% or 10% or half its value. Something can't/does not go down 20 times, they do go up 20x :)
So me just being a grammar nazi, I understood he most likely meant a drop in value of 95% or something like that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:04:16
To those betting long.
You can get in, the application fee is $1000 to process and you need to have a high net worth and be able to transfer in a very decent chunk of cash.
Then you get to trade on 44% margin, and will most likely fail to make money in the long run like most other people that day trade futures.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:38:30
You are right it will take 10 grand which SHOULD be doable if you bust your ass to catch up. If you sit on reddit and not try and catch up then no that $1000 will not work.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:15:38
Depends on the exchange and your total net worth
99% chance the answer is no, do not bother
As that number hits $500 I would bet 20% of people would say yes to a paper wallet. At 1000 it jumps to 50%
Others are comfortable storing 50 grand or a million on an exchange (depending on the exchange).
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:39:01
If you can get the private key for it, then make a new electrum wallet and import that key into the wallet (don't sweep it in).
Then both wallets essentially are connected to your coins and you can set fees in it. Or the core wallet can do this too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:38
Have fun timing it. If you are that good you could have timed the 4k 1 hour swings and made a killing.

Ok reading what you said...I 100% agree that once on the LN the number of TX are unlimited so we agree.
Now you say the congestion is further down the road? That is wrong and not a tiny bit wrong but orders of magnitude wrong and you are right that block sizes will not be able to tackle the magnitude.

If it is substantial and you are certain they are lost, post the public address. Sometimes people who end up with random coins will search the net for the address and they will find your post. If they feel like it they will return your bitcoins.

Did she leave out the part where accredited 3rd parties can purchase those contracts, hence creating a floating market for the contracts themselves?
A 3rd party can decide the factories contract is worth x $ to buy the rights to it and offers to do so. If the factory is cool with that they sell the contract and make a profit without having to accept the corn and turn it into cereal. And vice versa.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:44:28
Left out the part where to get any balance out you have to settle and pay the main chain fee again.
So 2 main chain fees on a chain that can only handle 146 million TX per year max.

If there is a 10% swing in the price in a 24 hour period it triggers a circuit breaker on this commodity on the CBOE which halts trading for a set period of time. They might even have a 20% cap on intraday swings.
It is meant to reduce risk because 50% swings can crush people and people hate being crushed so they all agree to circuit breakers which is generally a good idea sort of...

It is not the nodes that worry me (mostly)
It is the increased block size leading to consolidation in mining. The latency begins to pile up faster and faster adding pressure to be physically located near large miners to be able to get the jump on mining the next block. Many just accept the validity and start mining the next one because they fear missing out or giving ahead start to the competition.
Nodes matter to be able to trust and verify, despite many choosing not to do so does not mean they do not want the ability to have this choice.

By removing NN it removes the ability for a small government agency to refuse to license an ISP to do business if that ISP refuses the government's demand to shut down crypto networks.
Removing NN actually makes all cryptos safer.
I know that is not what you were lead to believe but it is true.
With NN in place, the ISPs were directly under the thumb of who ever is in charge in the WH. If the WH deems the ISP is enabling bad guys (a bunch of basement nerds undermining the power of the US dollar), they give the ISP a choice, shut it down or we will not license you as an ISP (shutdown the entire ISP) because under Title II they were deemed regulated utilities and required licensing.

That would be more like a stock split. A fork means you have the same number of Bitcoins but now also have the same number of coins on another ledger/blockchain.  If the new fork has some sort of protocol to say everyone has 10x the number of coins you could have 10x the number of alt forked coins.
The tricky part is to not share your original private keys otherwise bad guys could take the keys and snag your actual bitcoins when you were trying to use the forked coins. Sounds fun doesn't it. :)

Seems overly complicated instead of some sort of distributed ledger used to determine trust with a built in ability to point to a specific webpage for more information about a product or service.
    
Way less friction for all involved and the api built around the data structure would yield a wide range of hosting of services for easy navigation of that data.
I imagine craigslist's database being 100% open to all with multiple apps interfacing with it to make the user experience smooth and easy.
An Uber or Amazon could spring up out of that ecosystem and add value through conflict resolution and or escrow or a refund policy or anything they want to offer to both parties. The users choose.
Maybe in the end we are talking about the same thing.

Copy each public address (not private key) into blockchain.info and see if the addresses have any coins in them.
Do not move the coins around right away and do not post the private keys.
If you find some coins you also have the private keys to Bcash and Bgold coins.
You would move the Bitcoins first. Then move the bcash then the bgold with wallets designed to use those alt coins.
Good luck.

Yes the entire crypto market will be taking a beating. Millions of new people that got in over the last 6 weeks will learn a seriously bad lesson. They will not be rushing back to get beat on some more.
So the next batch of new people will need to convince themselves of the greatness of the tech and that will take time.
Eventually we will get there and many people will lose a lot along the way.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:20:06
To avoid shut downs and regulation the tech would require a blockchain with distributed nodes and lightweight mining.
The fees would be paid by web portals that tie into the data structures to simply show users the seller profiles. The fees would be there to simply make and host a decent UI for the underlying tech.
Either way adoption is going to be tricky this early on, but maybe in another year it will be time for your chain to bloom.
Time will tell.

Simply look at the cost of the mining rig then and estimate how many coins it could mine while not breaking and or running out of free electric.
If that is safely higher than the number of coins that could be used to buy it then do so and dont forget the pain in the ass you are giving someone else for having to keep checking on it.
And remember shit can go wrong too and the place could catch fire or the free electric could vanish or a chip on the rig could blow.

Imagine us 1 year from now and 10x or 20x the current adoption levels.
Even if LN is a huge thing, you still have to load and settle the LN. 2 TXs one on and one to get off.
The fees on the main chain are still huge/high. So noobs and going to fund a LN channel with $100 to use as spending cash and pay $10 fee? Really?
I am simply not buying the story that LN will fix bitcoin at all.

Enabling "Post Only" when creating a limit order will ensure that your limit order is posted to the order book and sits on the order book to be charged a Maker Fees if it is filled. If any part of the order would execute immediately due to its price when arriving at the matching engine, the entire order will be rejected. This is useful for ensuring that an order is not subject to Taker Fees, if desired.
If you do not enable Post Only, any part of an order that is at a price that would execute immediately, will execute immediately and be charged Taker Fees; any remainder of the order will remain on the order book and will be charged Maker Fees if filled.
You can enable the "Post Only" setting by clicking the "Advanced" drop-down in the Limit Order entry form. This setting will be retained between sessions.

If the fee was 1 satoshi there is still not enough TX available on the main chain to be able to load and settle a LN channel for all the people using bitcoins.

They do not just do the 1 sat level spam, you up it and up it steadily at a predetermined rate.
Those with legit transactions see it and go higher, rinse and repeat week after week, no to low losses for the spammer and huge upside for those that benefit from high fees. 
That is my only explanation, it may not meet your expectations for greatness. The 278,000 unconfirmed transactions right now do not care how accurate my explanation is.
Next month when we near 400,000 we can debate it again. When it hits 500,000 we will not have to debate because there will be no point.

Watch the yt vids on it.
Right now you would need to open a channel between you two, fund it from the main blockchain, move the coins around then move them back. 
In that case that would not be a good use of LN (doubles the tx). Its good when you need to do many many tx with someone that does 1000s of tx. You basically join a side chain and settle up once a month or once a week on the main chain or once a year if you feels ballsy.
Not all tx make sense for LN but many do and when it makes sense to use the LN it will be a HUGE advantage to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:41:33

And if 40 million? Thats 1 each, not counting actually buying the coin, not counting the TXs done by mining on the chain, and pretending no other TXs will be done on the chain.
People are waking up and the future looks bleak. LN is not the scaling solution, schnoor and segwit aren't it either. Until I hear a concrete solution for the core devs regarding an immediate path forward I am not a fan of this coin, and just a note but no coin has a concrete plan to address the problem. Bitcoin just happens to have run into the problem first because we are so big.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:39

I give you 100% of all that.
My final time saying this to you. 
The loading onto the LN channel and the final settlement (offloading) of the LN takes 2 TX on the main chain.
Those are the only 2 TX I am talking about, not the billion that work on the LN itself.
Those 2 need to be from and to the main chain and be in that ledger (the bitcoin main blockchain).
The main chain can only hold 147 million per year total TX. This has nothing to do with LN at all.
So 40 million users can load and settle out of a channel 2 times per year max before the block is perma filled. 80 million users get 1 load and settle per year.
But we also know that anyone can still spam and use the main chain and they will (miners need to). So that 80 million users drops back down below 20 million and realistically you would load and settle more than once.
The math says this will not work even with 10 million bitcoin users.

At that point they should now know about public keys and have them tell you the address they want their coins sent to, then you send them the coins.

In this case the employer wins because the onus is put on the employee to pay their employee side of the taxes as well as the added employer side which is roughly 14%. So the employer saves 14% going this route and the guy will have to pay roughly 40% of the bonus value at the time the bonus was given.
    
Way better off for the employee to go through payroll, be taxed at the normal rate then buy the bitcoin themselves (they would be up 14% on day one).

While people mostly sort of know these contracts at settled in cash and not bitcoins it will still be a massive pull on the actual prices of bitcoin on the exchanges.
We thought we saw volatility before, get fucking ready for a whole new world of pain and gain. This tail may wag the dog like a mofo

The last thing you should be doing is begging others to get in on bitcoin.
When it crashes by 50% like it always does they will hate you. 
If you convince them to get in and tell them to sell now and they don't and then it crashes they will still hate you.
If they sell now and it goes to 100k they will hate you.
Notice a trend here?

14 hours is not a thing to be excited about for 95% of the new user base.
They do not care about centralization, they care about fast tx times with fees that cost 1-4 pennies.

General adoption is screaming past the possible help segwit could achieve even at full segwit use.
Segwit allows for 30% more TX into a block. So 5 per second to maybe 7 per second. This will make no significant dent in the mempool problem and within a month the mempool will approach 400k easily. We are nearly at 300k which is insanely packed.

No main chain will ever record the 3-8 cash/credit transactions every person on earth does per day until the end of time.
There will be side chains that you fund via a main chain once a month or once a quarter. That side chain will settle up daily or every 1 minute and will be decentralized. Then every 1-3 months the entire chain will settle out through the main chain and delete itself (although some people will still archive the completed side chain).

This is all part of an open and free marketplace.
We are not used to it, our kids will embrace it.
We lived our lives in an orderly, authorized, regulated 'utopia'.
We lifted the curtain to peak at the other side, many cringed at what they saw, others grew wide eyed with wonder and awe.
Slowly some of us slipped under the curtain to the other side, and grew accustomed to the lack of authority and chaos. 
Recently millions with hats down over their eyes and fingers in their ears, tore down the curtain and leaped into the chaos.
They opened their eyes and pulled out their fingers and huddled together for assurance. They looked around for the guy in charge, the police, anyone with any idea of what was going on and found out they were in charge.
    
Then...a sudden noise cracked out from above. It frightened the herd badly but the voices of calm were drowned out by those scrambling for the safety of the curtain.
Many were trampled during the tumult, many more will perish and then the calm will return. Those left will be stronger and wiser but the cycle will repeat itself again and again until finally the curtain is destroyed once and for all.

Scenario 1)
You and the seller have already joined a massive massive massive channel and paid a LARGE fee to pre load it with $2000 to make the loading fee worth it.
You make your LN TX and her balance goes up 50 cents and yours down 50 cents.
Some time in the future you settle up (months years?) and pay the high fee to exit the channel and settle the account.
    
Scenario 2)
You pay $20 to $100 to open a channel, she pays this fee as well, you swap 50 cents, and both pay $20 to $100 to settle.
Not going to happen :)
    
Scenraio 3) 
The fees and tx times stay so bad and the max TX in the main chain stay so low that no one can afford to us the LN in the first place.
     
Guess which one will happen :) I am betting on 1

If there are no buyers the price drops rapidly just like in any other market. The people wanting to sell their bitcoin for cash keep lowering their ask price until they entice a buyer. If none are found they go lower and lower.
The opposite happens as well. People want to buy them but few are selling so the buyers raise their bids to entice a seller to sell for cash.
The more people in the market the better the liquidity (helps keep wild swings down).

Long term it brings stability to a volatile market. It would allow for instance, miners to hedge their bitcoin mining against future price drops which is VERY important.
Imagine a farmer farming cotton, he buys a short position for a fraction of his expected yield that season. If his crop comes out fine he loses his short position of 3% or what every it cost but safely sells the rest. If shrek comes by and stomps on his cotton field he loses his cotton but may break even due to that payout from the short position.
Sort of insuring your future.

The challenge now is to look at money in a new way and use time to your advantage. You are time RICH and cash Poor is all.
Putting money to work for you over time is the lesson. Treasure each dollar you can earn and look at it as an engine that spits out baby parts of money if put to work for you. Had I been told this years ago I would have made it to where I am now faster is all.
You are younger and can ride this bitcoin rocket of risk more than old fucks can. So take that $10 you were going to spend on fast food/movies/weed/cigs and start looking for ways to put it to work for you.

Each day gets settled with the price taken at 2:30pm CST (using a formula to give specific weights to prices over the last x minutes up to 2:30pm).
So you have massive positions being settled using this specific value, if you can someone influence that value then the effect gets magnified greatly. A $100 move which may only be 1% could be leveraged to quite an extent.
It is institutional games played by people with billions.

Could simply have a manager handle it with a clipboard and a phone app to check the current price of bitcoin.
The customer scans the QR code on the clipboard and the manager verifies they have the funds and sent the coins (no need to wait for confirms unless you get some fraud going on).
The tip is going to be messy but you could just have them write the tip or tell the tip amount then have the manager give the server the cash on the spot.
Also fees are high right now so you might want to include them in the price? Not sure.

There are opportunities just like bitcoin happening and starting every year.
Position yourself to take advantage of them, that means not wasting resources on junk and investing your most precious resource (time) well.
Are you investing your resources and time properly to be in position to leverage them when presented with the next opportunity? If not why not? Are your family members doing so? If not why not?
    
If your answer is there is nothing extra left and you are living week to week paycheck to paycheck then seriously look into your budget and where the dollars go, then look at how time is spent. 
Now look for the top 5 ways to impact your cash flow positively, then look at 3 ways to spend your time more wisely.

@_date: 2017-11-27 09:14:03
There is inherent value in the ability to transfer value quickly and easily without a TRUSTED third party involved.
Currently the cost and time is higher than we want but still amazingly low and no need for trusted third party to centralize and authorize the transactions.
That is the purpose of bitcoin, we already had various ways to move value but they all required authorization. Bitcoin solved that, hence its immense and growing value.

There are way more than 2 types of people who purchase/become involved with bitcoin. You being unable to mention more than 2 indicates you do not know the scope of the tech or are trying to fit your argument into a false narrative.
Now that I poked that big whole in your wall of text, can you possibly name more than 2 (of course you can).
    
You do not seem to be attacking the bitcoin tech at all not once, but are attacking its users and adopters.

Into your GDAX btc wallet which in different than your coinbase wallet. You can transfer the bitcoins back and force instantly to coinbase and gdax all day for (fun?) or to your own wallet or best yet to a paper wallet made offline with a pc that will never be online in the future (ideally never on ever on the net which is air gaped and make sure the code used to generate the private key for that wallet is legit and signed).

Some cpus were dedicated to mining, others for full nodes.
Early days you would do a pull request for an address to send the money to the right person vs that person sending you their address.
1 PC could mine (and did at one point) then run some full nodes and so basic software for wallets and you are good to go.
The difficulty would adjust so that the nodes were mined every 10 minutes but I bet they cut that down to 1 minute just to get things rolling.

Women are not risk tolerant in general, a small percentage are. Men have evolved to have to embrace risk.

Just wondering if during the first week or so they lowered them to 1 minute just to pass time faster. Then release the alpha version of the code as 10 minutes.
Satoshi has a min of 1 million coins, that is a LOT of blocks mined. He would have had to mine for 6 months by himself with no one else getting a block to nab 1 million coins. Not to mention he may have other addresses as well.
