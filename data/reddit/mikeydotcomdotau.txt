This interim ruling must change. Other legislatures have taken this path and then backflipped. The thing is it wont earn a penny of tax (exchanges and payment processors will head offshore, or close their doors), and an innovative new industry will be killed off, along with all of the jobs it created and the taxes that it paid. This is some seriously flawed thinking on the part of the ATO.

See the walls of their garden crumbling now though. Apple is no longer bound by the direction of the sycophant Jobs, and just as well, for their technology is being outpaced. Missing the boat on digital currencies is a shining example. Apple needs to understand that open source, distributed, collaborative technologies are eventually more useful and robust than proprietary, centralised, and competition based ones. Apple never had to resort to anti-competitive practices because they make lovely machines and are very good at product development, but they did anyway.

Maybe you are underestimating adoption, especially localised adoption. There are bars in Melbourne that take $300 a night in btc, which sounds about right for 10 percent. That's not all businesses that accept bitcoin, though. It's early days, and the bitcoin economy has yet to endure the fallout from Mt Gox, silly government rulings, naysaying publicity from the old order, etc. before adoption really hits the upswing. I am confident that digital currencies are an inevitability. We live in a digital age, and the coins and chitties of paper currency in your wallet are little different to shells and wampum.

Bitcoins will become easier to get, with ATMs rolling out. Paying for stuff with your phone is a killer application of bitcoin - no bulky wallet full of cards, no fumbling for change. Convenience is a potentially huge driver - as is low transaction fees, a more secure form of cash, etc. It's better for merchants as well than traditional forms of electronic remittance. More secure, cheaper, easier. I agree that it will take a while yet before these benefits are realised by the mainstream and widespread adoption occurs; but I have confidence that it will happen.

We learned that if you need to input data (ie the sale amount) in the tablet, a 9 inch screen or bigger is best. Test your POS systems QR codes on the screen you are considering - we had to change QR libraries because one of them just would not work with apple's retina display. Think about battery life and security - how you mount the device to the retail counter and charge it need to be considered.

Google could integrate a btc wallet that used both NFC or QR to facilitate transactions. The emoney game will not be won by apple or google because BTC is already universal. Whichever company builds their payment system on top of bitcoin will prevail.

When smartphone wallets can transact using bluetooth or NFC with bitcoin POS systems, the transaction time will be virtually instant. Of course apple will have to come to the party - which they are doggedly trying to avoid right now. I hope that they capitulate or lose massive market share because of this. The e-money problem has been solved and it isnt proprietary, it isnt a walled garden, it is Bitcoin. It's already universal.

DC POS logs enough sales information for our merchants to comply. They can download it as CSV file. Most merchants will not be affected, unless their chosen payment processor /wallet provider is Australian. I fear that the exchanges will cease trading in Australia, and that will seriously stifle adoption. Nobody  will want to buy Btc to spend if they have to pay 10 percent  GST when they exchange AUD, and then pay it again when they buy stuff with Btc. I maintain that adoption is the critical hurdle for Btc... And this is a critical threat to adoption making it to the tipping point.

Gox was a failure because they centralised trust, which is the antithesis of bitcoin.

I am about to launch a bitcoin pos system in Australia.
our fees are 1.5 percent, including exchange fees. Comparably, credit cards and EFT POS  charge from 3 - 7%. There is no cost for the merchant to convert back to fiat. BTC dollar for dollar intra-day hedging means that if you sell a coffee for three bucks, you get three bucks in your bank account that night. Don't forget that the low transaction cost is just one of the benefits of doing business in BTC; there is also the fact that bitcoin is convenient (just pay for stuff with your phone), Instant (for zero confirmation transactions on things like small every day purchases), Irreversible (no charge backs), and very secure.

Apple are developing their own contactless electronic payment system using "iBeacon" technology. See  . I think that these ideas about proprietary systems obtaining market share in the e-payment space are too late. Bitcoin has beaten them to it. My tip is that you will see an explosion in "bitcoin accepted here" signs in 2014; and that if apple continue to ban BTC wallets from their app store then they will lose market share as a direct result.

It's a great example of how in addition to security and anonimity, bitcoin is extrememly useful for minipayments (&lt;$100) and micropayments (&lt;$10). In the US there are several competing POS systems now to allow this, and soon there will be a couple in Australia.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:41:04
My response, which got spiked, was: 
Hi Jessica, 
Unfortunately many of your reservations about bitcoin have come about because you don't understand some of its features, such as bitcoin "mining". The bitcoin mining process (in which miners solve complex mathematical problems with computing power in exchange for bitcoins) becomes progressively more difficult as more and more coins are mined.  This is analogous to the process of mining gold; the first miners are able to easily collect alluvial gold, then they have to dig, and eventually strike deep shafts to find gold. Bitcoin, like gold, is scarce, and has great utility. Bitcoins utility comes from it's low transaction cost; ease of international remittance, irrevocable transactions, and escrow features. Your assertion that bitcoin relies on trust is incorrect. Fiat currencies, and other forms of digital currency such as credit cards, all implicitly require us to trust a government or a bank. Bitcoin requires no such trust, it is absolutely decentralised, with the ledger of transactions (the "blockchain") protected by very strong crypotgraphy and onerous proof-of-work. No coins will be mined after the 21 millionth coin because the difficulty of doing so will become mathematically too difficult. I strongly recommend that you read Satoshi Nakamoto's paper  (it is only 8 pages) so that you may grasp the nature of this currency, because unfortunately you have gone to print without understanding the fundamental processes of this disruptive technology. Readers, I recommend that you do not "trust" Jessica Irvine until she does her research!

(1) Because you will, at the start, have some novelty sales.
(2) Because as a digital currency at point of sale method, it's waaay cheaper than visa /mc/amex
(3) It's more convenient cash than cash. You don't have to worry about denominations.
(4) There are BTCPOS companies who offer intraday dollar-for-dollar hedging and end of day deposit to your bank account. That's a better deal than any internationally floated fiat currency AND they make you wait 3 days.
(5) You can begin to trade for your business inputs in bitcoin - it's great for internet based payments.
(6) Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. No. More. Chargebacks.
(7) It's cash 3.0 - pay for shit with your phone. No bank fees.

Simple answer to the price fluctuation issue - get them to open a coinjar wallet. They can nominate to keep in bitcoin, or for it to be immediately converted and deposited to their bank at the end of the day. Coinjar offer dollar for dollar intraday hedging.

It's great for microtransactions and minitransactions; buying your milk, paying for your parking meter, splitting bills at restaurants, vending machines etc. It's cash 3.0, where you don't need the inconvenience of denomination. We are developing a retail POS integration for the Australian market for this reason - to take the focus off silkroad and big ideas of cryptoanarchism, and instead show that bitcoin is the resilient, universal way to pay for stuff over the net, or with your phone, or someday soon even your wristwatch!

This article has so many factual inaccuracies that the best thing you could do with it is print it out, roll it around a cardboard tube and hang it on the wall in your shitter, for the purposes of improving it with the application of excrement. It was Mutum Sigillum, an entity that acts as an intermediary between Gox and Dwolla that has been collared by the DHS. Not Mt Gox. The waffle about wallets and identifying customers if absolute piffle, because Mt Gox have not been targetted. The problem (and it is clear), is that Mutum Sigillum did not declare itself as a money transfer service, although it can easily be argued that it was not a money transfer service open to the public but rather just a service agent between dwolla and Gox. Mt Gox, bitcoins, and anonymity have no relevance to this allegation, which revolves solely around whether M.S. was acting as a money transfer service.

The note acceptor worked ok... it rejected about 10 percent of the time, but that's not bad for a non-currency specific note acceptor. I fed in 20 x 50 dollar notes, and it took about 2 minutes. There were 2 confirmations on the blockchain within a minute. The scanner read my mycelium wallet QR instantly. By the time I had scooted home (5 mins) the coins were in my wallet. 4.5 stars; would Lamassu Again!

Your assertion that it has nothing to do with bitcoin just means that you are a little near-sighted. The inferences from the discourse are clearly applicable to cryptocurrencies, and especially BTC. Interestingly, I took a long position in ag and a short one in BTC. If I had invested long in BTC I would be 200K richer! Given the context of regulatory risk for BTC  I thought it good food for thought. Thank you for your thoughts.

Adoption, or lack of it, for BTC as a medium of exchange, rather than a vehicle for speculation, is the greatest current threat. Getting enough folks with wallets on their phones and enough merchants willing to accept BTC is critical.... the currency has so many benefits (denomination free, great for micro and mini payments, inexpensive, universal) but they can't be realized unless you all ask everybody if they know about  bitcoin; ask every merchant you purchase everyday things with if they accept bitcoin; give your friends some bitcoin but only if they share it with someone else. I am not sure whether uptake is the chicken or the egg; but that's the issue bitcoin faces. We need to explain decentralized currency! Carefully! From the rooftops!

It's the adoption problem. We have the chicken, but for chickens to be prolific, we need eggs. For that to happen the obverse hypothesis is true; people need to have real world stuff to spend their BTC on for the currency to displace fiat. It really is the final barrier for bitcoin. When I dont have to fumble for change at the parking meter; when I can get my bread and my milk with my phone; when we can settle a split bill at a restaurant by instantly sharing btc; then the exponential curve of adoption will occur.
