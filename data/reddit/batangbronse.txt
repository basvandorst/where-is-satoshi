ive yet to try that out. thanks a lot!

what’s the reason for the drop? just asking
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:40:55
Yeah I was checking out both and was hoping to use one as my main exchange. Thanks! :)

Can you still buy alts in Binance?
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:43:35
Im not from the US so I have to use my local exchange (only exchanges local fiat to BTC/ETH) so I have to transfer AGAIN to a larger exchange. Fees are killing me tbh
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:23:52
alright. thanks a lot!!

Newbie here so please take it easy on me. What's the difference between Binance and Bitstamp? Do you prefer one with the other?
Another question, is  a legit segwit wallet? Am I understanding this right?
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:23:06
Does it have to be segwit?

I dunno really, most, if not all, use coins.ph since it’s very convenient
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:22:13
Yeah. That’s what I was afraid of too that’s why Im trying to study up on how to so secure my coins. All these fees is such a downer though. I tried transferring from my exchange to mycelium but the fees turned me off.

Thanks for this. Learned a lot. Especially Bitcon vs Ethereum. Is the outlook of the future of eth good?
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:19:26
Thanks for being patient with me. I'm using coins.ph as my exchange right now. All of my btc are also there, so far what I understood is, I must first transfer some of my btc to another exchange (let's say bitfinex, since they support segwit) then convert my BTC to ETH there, then transfer my ETH to MEW? Am I understanding this right?

Just tried using it on Shapeshift right now. My transaction is still pending and I finally understand what's the hype(or problem) with high fees and long wait times now. I'll just charge all the losses right now to experience. Thanks a lot!

i got some btc from my local exchange (philippines). where can I possibly buy some eth? I already set up my eth wallet from MEW.
