...and what info did management give you in the last week?
I read that verifications were outsourced to remote workers... so verification documents (ID scans and utility bills etc) were on remote computers in different countries with no special security in place?

Unlike all the technologies shown on that chart, Bitcoin is also a store of value and a speculative asset (in addition to other things), therefore one cannot expect it to behave the same as those other technologies in regards to adoption and market value.

He may have been repeating what Karpeles told him.  Maybe Karpeles thought it was not much but after a week+ of auditing has realized that it was much much more.

Misleading title.  Byrne is just speculating.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:55:45
So lets speculate on what this sentence means:
"Acted alone and in desperation"
Gox created the leaked draft?
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:17:50
So you're suggesting that he's resigning from Gox?  Thats what you seem to be inferring.

Did you have 2FA enabled?
@_date: 2014-04-12 15:36:41
They do have 200,000 coins. Whether they will be distributed by logging into the site or some other way I don't know, but I want to be prepared if I have to log in with a OTP as I have in the past.

Did you have 2FA enabled?

Did you have 2FA enabled?
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:22:59
typical gox
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:31:30
You can't backpedal now.  You not so subtly suggested that you saw good news on the horizon after speaking at length with Karpeles.


Also, you're smart enough to realize that saying something like that will move the market.  So don't come on here and play dumb.

This.  Got to have 2FA enabled for any Bitcoin trading site.  I haven't heard of any accounts with 2FA being hacked.  Even with a key logger.  If someone knows contrary please let me know.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:56:16
I have the same suspicion.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:14:23
They have regular events there where there is a live trading floor for BTC, I've been and it's fun.  Bought some BTC there.  
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:28:24
They took Ross Ulbricht's bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:42:45
Agreed.  Nobody who owned goxbtc (including me) wants to be reminded of gox; it's just bad branding.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:44:19
Let's crowd fund his 2016 opponent with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:44:27
Yep blockchain.com wallet is my guess as well.  That would be great news for iPhone users, of which there are about 500 million I think.
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:47:58
I'm using an iPhone with Google Authenticator.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:17:25
How did you get a transfer confirmation without receiving funds?  Was the confirmation actually from pingit?

There's a new tweet:

I know of no deals. I believe Karpeles was full of shit re buyers. No one would touch this pariah.  
I wonder if he passed this tweet by his lawyer...
He "believes" Karpeles was full of shit.  Sounds like a theory not like a fact.

I'm a NY resident, this means I can't buy bitcoin in other states?
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:33:30
But if an individual in NJ does not have a bitlicense I can't buy from them when I travel to NJ because I'm a NY resident?

Bitcoin is useful as a medium for money transmission.  This is a huge market that is not considered closely enough when people are discussing Bitcoin as a currency for buying goods and services.
International remittances totaled over 500 billion USD last year and are growing as migration from developing countries increases.  Bitcoin is poised to be a viable alternative to Western Union/Moneygram and other such high fee services, whether it is used directly from one party to another, or through an intermediary service.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:40:47
Yes, and Bitcoin is a store of value and a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:19:39
and what can you buy with gold?
