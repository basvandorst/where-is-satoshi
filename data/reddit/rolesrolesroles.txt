Segwit was a soft fork. The whole point of a soft fork is that it was optional, right?

Here's an academic study done in 2016 supporting the stance that larger blocksizes (of 4MB) DO NOT lead to centralization. Given that storage capacity keeps increasing overtime, we should be at 8MB by now at least without affecting decentralization.

Communities are probably keeping track of how much they owe each other and then making transactions in bulk to reduce fees. Sorta like keeping tabs on each other.

Why don't you buy him with Bitcoin instead of selling Bitcoin for fiat to buy him?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:53:18
What...Is Steam a shill paid by the mining cartel? Because quite literally the point of their statement is about unpredictable and high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:14:18
So many people are lowkey BCH supporters without knowing it. You are dreaming if you think BTC will support a blocksize increase after the NO2X drama.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:50:32
People are just making bogus fee complaints, aye?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:55:17
We should be at 8MB+ without it affecting decentralization given this study was done 2 years ago.

The mod logs are public in the other subreddit so show us where your post was deleted?

Bitcoin strongly rejected Segwit2x. Do you not remember the  movement?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:00:24
It has been done already.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:57:28


 
Bitcoin was working for long time already without hefty fees.

You are starting to see the light.

No it is literally what Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream) said.
I'll link the relevant tweet below.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:43:04


Have a look at this tweet and apply your own words/thoughts to it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:48:00
So you acknowledge that selling side chain solutions is Blockstream's plan?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:00:03
You actually said zero statements that can be verified by proof. LOL
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:25:33
So you think the reason Bitcoin Cash has had a 60% increase in price and has had about $5 billion USD in volume in the last 24 hours is because BCH is winning "meme wars"?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:01:30
Do you agree or disagree that the moderation logs are open to see, compared to how it is here?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:08:24
What is your point just to be clear?
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:37:04
Wasn't Segwit2x literally a small 1MB block increase from the Bitcoin we have now?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:40:15
Some people are all about non-arguments...
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:00:32
So you are admitting that (1) Blockstream is acting in their own interests and (2) it is okay for people to act in their own interests.
So why are people so up in arms if miners act in their own interests.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:00:13
The point of my comment was to show you your earlier comment isn't true, nothing more. Do you acknowledge you got it wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:55:45
Does on-chain scaling involve increasing block sizes?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:15:14
A meme war? Seriously?

Seriously? You think $4 million is a coward's bet? You actually expect him to bet $400 million? How about we just skip to killing the other if one coin is more successful. This is getting so out of hand.
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:15:47
What solution are you waiting on?
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:32:53
Why do people keep bringing up the fallacy that the volatility of bitcoin affect its use as a currency? You are looking at opportunity cost from just one way. Say you buy a $1000 TV with fiat with bitcoin trading currently at $4400. If tomorrow, Bitcoin jumps to $5000, you effectively have paid more for your TV because from an opportunity cost point of view you could have invested that $1000 in Bitcoin yesterday (instead of buying that TV) and bought your TV the next day from your proceedings. Alternatively, if one was intending to pay for a TV with a Bitcoin was worried that Bitcoin would rise in value over the next day, one would simply buy more Bitcoin to mitigate  the increase in value.
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:17:55
With the payday example, if the contract is that you owe workers $100,000 fiat worth of Bitcoin then really you simply owe just $100,000 in fiat. Adding that "..worth of bitcoin" is just misdirecting yourself from the unit you are actually working in. I think it is hard to see right now because fiat is our base line measurement but really from an economic or logical standpoint, it doesn't matter either way. If it makes it easier, just change the word Bitcoin out for a different fiat (such as EURO, AUD, YEN or whatever) that also fluctuates and you should see its just works the same way as with Bitcoins.

That is definitely a factor. Will be interesting to see what happens after the forks.

You are literally saying r/btc is a place of hate on a r/btc hate thread. ???
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:47:43
Ask on r/btc if you have any genuine controversial questions, if they can't answer it, then that says something.
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:38:19
Both sides are attacking and retaliating against the other about mutual topics. It is such a subjective thing to say that one side is more of a negative place than the other.
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:16:31
When you make a statement like "he is scum" it would be a decent thing to justify it with some sort of reason.

Any reasonable person can sift through 'bullshit'. You don't need to tell people that, it makes your comment look insecure.

You don't believe economic freedom will help impoverished countries improve their living standards and help reduce infant mortality rates?
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:01:33
You are dodging my question. Economic freedom does lead to a better life for everyone. Hopefully you agree. If you do, why do scoff at the idea that a scalable Bitcoin will save the lives of babies. And do you honestly think Bitcoin can scale better than Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:21:44
I previously wrote a comment saying has open moderator logs and does not. A factual statement. My comment was then shadow banned a few minutes later. Is that free speech?
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:00:03
What am I claiming? Putting words in my mouth it seems.
Happy to PM you evidence of my comment being silently removed. What part of my comment was spam?

He's not buying the sub though? So much unnecessary spin from people here.

In your opinion, is about bitcoin?
