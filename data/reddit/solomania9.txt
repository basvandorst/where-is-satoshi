Yo! I'm not actively developing it on a daily basis, but I'm constantly monitoring it and making sure it's bug-free. If there's a groundswell of interest from the community I might be able to spend more time on it. I still think it's an interesting idea if more people continue to use it.
@_date: 2015-12-04 14:30:57
Good observation. You're correct - my guess is that many people are tipping themselves to boost their visibility (although there's no way for me to be 100% certain). But in any case, self-tipping is one small piece of the larger pay-per-character ecosystem I'm exploring with the site. I hope you enjoy it!

Ok, great. This means you probably have access to your "private key", which you'll need to move the funds. (Note, your private key is different than your public key. Never share your private key with anyone.)

Great idea! It's funny but I had this exact same curiosity, and since I'm a huge nerd I created a website for it. If you go to Bitcoin Megaphone ( you could create a post for each poem. That way, each poem would have its own public address that people could tip. (Of course, it's not free to create a post, but that adds to the fun; longer poems are more expensive, but might not generate as many tips.) I'd love to see how poetry performs on the website (if you'd be so kind as to post something.)

Cool, thanks. I'm looking into this. (I don't have an Android phone to test with but I'm Googling...)

No apology needed. You give a great overview of why using bitcoin today is complicated. 
I should have clarified when I said it's frictionless. I should have said it has the potential to be frictionless. In the future when the bitcoin protocol is embedded into apps and devices, then we'll see those frictionless transactions. For example, pay someone 2 cents to pass them on the highway. Or to pay a website 10 cents if you read a few articles. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 12:44:27
This is a misguided effort.
Instead, we should get online publishers and websites to accept bitcoin so they don't have to run ads in the first place.
@_date: 2014-06-01 10:34:53
True. For better anonymity you can use localbitcoins to meet someone in person, although logistically it's a little more complicated.
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:17:57
True. For your mom you could just replace Excel with "balance sheet" or "account list" and just eliminate the BitTorrent part altogether. 
You might also want to add a brief overview of merkle roots and ASICs. Actually, maybe not.

I dunno. I'm skeptical to send money to random addresses, especially when the minimum is .1 BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-08 10:43:49
Micropublishing has taken off. People are used to paying to speak in many public places. Imagine an exclusive nightclub where you're charged about $100 per word you say. (It's electronically monitored and goes on your tab). It would be cool to see a wide shot of hundreds of fatcats blabbing away in a nightclub and imagine how much money they're burning through.
(This is inspired by the bitcoin publishing site I created,  :-)
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:17:57
Thanks for the comments. Why impose an arbitrary limit on characters? People could do some cool stuff with long posts, like embed the raw data in an image file, or create long scrolling ascii art. Hollywood spends millions of dollars promoting movies - who's to say they can't spend lots of money on a long weird post to promote something? That could be fun.
Good news - you can already upvote with donations! Just click the dropdown menu, and choose "Sort By: Most Tipped". It will give you a link like this:

You only need to do the randomness thing once (when you load the page), then you can generate as many addresses in the "Paper Wallet" tab as you'd like. Also, if you select "Hide Art" the addresses are much easier to work with.
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:50:54
You're not doing anything wrong. The total number of people who are using/spending bitcoin is still super low. 
I'm in a similar boat as you. I built a website solely for bitcoin early adopters where bitcoin is the only payment method ( and it's still only getting a post or two per day.

I that article would be intimidating for a newbie (assuming the newbie is someone who casually wants to start spending BTC, and not a developer or someone who wants to dive deep into the specifics). The average person will see pages of text, charts, graphs, and say forget it.
I think this is one of Bitcoin's biggest obstacles to acceptance among everyday people. There are very few "getting started" guides that are simple for laypeople.

I'm also completely fascinated with the idea of anonymous publishing. In fact, I built a website that does exactly what you describe (although in a digital, not analog, format).
There are two parts to pulling this off. The first part is "pay per character." This helps fight spam, and gives longer more expensive pieces of content an increased measure of importance. The analogy carries through to physical printing - longer books are naturally more expensive.
The second part is public key generation. Each piece of content on the website has its own unique public bitcoin address where tips can be sent. This generates income for the author, since the private keys for that address are ONLY shown to the author when he/she is paying for the post. This ensures they are the only person who can collect the tips, while staying completely anonymous.
I'm not sure how many of these concepts you can apply to your project, but you might find them helpful. Happy to share additional lessons learned or answer more questions.

The site's not for everyone, so you might not ever need/want to use it. But I see it as being useful for writers / comedians who want to try and make money. 
Or if you're passionate about a subject and want to show you're committed to the cause, you could post something then embed it on your own blog or site. A wall of text on Facebook or someone's blog is meaningless, but if someone sees a wall of text on bitcoin megaphone, they know the poster is somewhat serious.

I use Coinbase and Localbitcoins. Honestly, Coinbase has had better rates lately. Here's a more detailed account of Localbitcoins taken from my blog post if you want to read more. (
Then there's LocalBitcoins.com, where you can get Bitcoins right away. Honestly, this website scares the crap out of me. The idea of meeting total strangers and exchanging envelopes full of cash sounds absolutely horrifying. Luckily, I found a way to use the site that I'm comfortable with, and is decidedly less sketchy.
First, find a seller with a perfect rating (ie, 100+ transactions and 100% positive feedback. Just like eBay.) Then make sure the payment method is "Cash deposit" in a major bank with a location close to you. When you initiate a transaction with the seller, the seller places your bitcoins in escrow and provides you with a bank account number. Then you head to the bank and make a cash deposit into that account with a teller. You'll get a receipt, which you then photograph and upload to LocalBitcoins as proof you deposited the money. Then the seller releases the Bitcoins from escrow, and the funds show up in your account. Nice.

Advice well taken - I appreciate it. My general approach is the "million dollar homepage" model where people post because of the novelty.

Yeah. Bitcoin is so deep technical you'll never be able to explain it in a casual conversation to a curious friend.
Instead just talk about the ledger, and if they're interested they'll start asking questions that need more technical answers. (IE, "What if I make a rogue ledger that says I have a million bitcoins?" Then you get into mining, proof-of-work, and further down the rabbit hole...)
I think a major problem is that we try to explain ALL OF BITCOIN to people who are curious, and it comes across as confusing and intimidating.

Although I love the analogy, I'm not so sure. People say he activated his bitcointalk.org account to say he wasn't Dorian Nakamoto. That means he's watching current events. If Bitcoin adoption grows there will likely be much more important events that he might want to weigh in on. Just a thought.
@_date: 2014-07-08 10:17:08
People can earn currency by doing little simple things; picking up litter, holding a door for someone, saying good morning to someone. What develops is a faux-religious "golden rule" where people seem good-intentioned but nobody can tell who is "good" because they're simply "good" or because they're covertly earning money. Also maybe a mind-boggling wealthy religious fanatic is funding a lot of this. It's interesting to explore mixing greed, anonymity, altruism, and religious motivations.

I couldn't agree more. People talk about retweets and likes as "social currency", but that's just because the technology hadn't existed to make it "actual currency" until now.

Right, makes sense. 
What I think happened is that he created a Bitcoin Megaphone post using one of his own wallet addresses, then tried tipping his own post. So in essence he's sending money to himself.

Clever :-) See my edit in the original post: Basically if you win, your post cold generate additional tips to its own unique public key. So I'll send you the private keys so you can import those tips as well. I hadn't thought about that aspect when creating this contest.

Totally agree, and this seems to be the conventional wisdom. 
But I remember reading something about hackers targeting high value public keys in the hopes they were created from private keys which were generated with bad brain wallet pass phrases. They brute force these brain wallet pass phrases in the hopes of finding a private key that matches with the public key/address they found online. Anyone know if I'm remembering this correctly?
In any case, I imagine I have less to worry about if I've created my private keys with a dedicated offline computer and using source downloaded from

So what you're saying is, invest in soybeans? Kidding...
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:08:42
Every bitcoin address has 2 parts - the public key (aka the address, which usually starts with a 1) and the private key (which usually starts with a 5, and is a little longer than the public key). 
Public keys are totally safe to publish anywhere. Sometimes Coinbase abbreviates a public key and ends it with "..." - just keep in mind that you'll need the full address if you want to send money to it.
Then, to be able to spend money from an address, you'll need its associated private key (the one that starts with a 5). The private key is the one you'll need to keep very secret and never publish anywhere. If you lose your private key, any money ever sent to the public address will be lost forever.
Hope this helps. Let me know if you have more questions.

Actually, everything looks OK to me. The balance in your screenshot of $13.7 matches with Blockchain's "Final Balance". (I'm assuming you tipped yourself on Bitcoin Megaphone (don't worry, it's OK, you won't go blind ;-)
The Insight website is confusing (as I learned in my other post) because it's "Total" is actually counting the same money twice if it's resent back into an addresses.
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:07:43
Correct, so I should clarify.
The bug (as far as I can tell) is that callbacks are being called by Coinbase for every page where a "Pay with Bitcoin" button is generated/displayed **but not necessarily clicked.**
I was using an example of where these buttons could appear on a merchant's website, and mentioned shopping carts just as an example, but the cart concept itself has nothing to do with the Bitcoin bug. Hope that clarifies.

Do the owners of this place have everything pooled into 1 massive entity or do they have a few? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:36:15
Awesome. By the way, I figured out what happened. On Bitcoin Megaphone I'm using Blockchain.info on the backend to check an address's balance, and when you made the post Blockchain.info must have been down. Rather than reject posts when I can't verify the balance, I let them through.
If you want to help spread bitcoin adoption, start spending and getting friends to spend too! I've gotten a few friends and family members started with mobile wallets... gotta start somewhere!
@_date: 2014-04-01 16:37:46
The easiest solution is probably to go to  and generate a paper wallet with 50 address on it. Then you can check those public addresses on blockchain.info. That should be completely secure.

Welcome! If you make a post on Bitcoin Megaphone you might make a few cents back in tips. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:23:29
I agree with you 100%. But most of the evidence that "users won't pay" was collected in the pre-bitcoin era. A frictionless payment method might change things, although it will take a while until we have any evidence of this.
My two cents; the cost of publishing will start rising from nil as publishers will need to start paying more to compete in a non-neutral internet that's owned by monopolies. (Hey, I don't like it either, but that's the direction we're headed in.) So as publishers pay more to create the content, users might pay more to consume it.
So as the bleeding-edge early adopters of this frictionless online payment system, I still think we should be looking to subsidize the quality publishers by whatever means possible, rather than paying to make a better band-aid. It might not work, but we should try.

The way I responded to the person who asked the question is I mentioned how bitcoins are infinitely divisible. That's the best answer I could come up with, but it still feels like a band-aid and not an answer.

It's considered good practice in society to spend some time in the "military". But of course the military isn't state-sponsored, it's a self-assembled group. And there's no physical fighting - instead everyone in the military works in an office cubicle doing cybercrime on the enemy.

You're right - but if bitcoin adoption grows like we all hope, it's just a matter of time before donations increase.
As early adopters of this technology, we should be careful of the precedents we set. I'd much rather help sculpt a publishing ecosystem where people pay for quality content, as opposed to playing a cat and mouse game funding ad blocking companies who are battling increasingly obtrusive ads.

Great article John! And thanks for posting Adam.
It's definitely fascinating to see how many people are spamming those big addresses to advertise their websites.
Speaking of, I built a website that basically does the same thing -  I'd love to get your thoughts on it!
(I do realize the irony that I'm essentially doing the same thing by posting this link...)
@_date: 2014-07-29 20:06:51
Thanks! You should write him back and waste his time! The more time he spends dealing with you, the less time he'll have to scam actual victims.
It's easy, just pretend you're an idiot and have him walk you through all the steps involved in sending a BTC transaction. You could have a lot of fun...

Just moved out of LIC 3 months ago - sorry I missed you!
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:28:45
Yeah, I like the idea of micropayments keeping out the crappy content. It's almost like the blockchain's "proof of work" to ensure security, but with "proof of cost" to ensure the poster is serious.
Unfortunately it's hard to detect if a post is original content or not, at least without adding lots of complexity to the site.
I'm thinking I'll steer clear of categories for now, but maybe I'll release an API, so people can take the data and categorize it anyway they want on their website. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:12:41
I was hoping someone as smart as you would respond. This is amazingly helpful. Thanks!
BTW, I'm only generating a few hundred addresses, so if I have a collision I'd be the luckiest person on earth.
@_date: 2014-06-01 12:29:45
I really like this description. 
The only potential problem is that the idea of a bank conjures up a central authority. So you might want to add something like... "And this bank isn't a physical bank, but it's open source software that can run on anyone's computer."
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:12:44
I think it's great! It's a really nice approachable bird's eye view.
You might also want to mention Coinbase for merchants. I use them for  and have been relatively happy.

Hi Deebo - Congrats on getting the tips! There are a few ways you can collect your tips. You can either "sweep" your address, or "import" your private key into a wallet. The process differs slightly depending on what wallet software you have.
But the most important part is that you have the private key for your public address. Do you have that? (By the way, don't share it anywhere online or someone will steal it!)
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:25:12
Thanks for the Bitcoin Megaphone mention! I believe you said you tipped, this post, which made it the first profitable post on the site! 
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:16:38
Yo! I'm also a huge believer in microtransactions. So I built a website that functions very similarly to what you're describing. Each post automatically generates a bitcoin address, which becomes the permalink. Then you can sort by most expensive, most profitable, etc...
Check out it:
Alternatively, you could monitor a few bitcoin addresses using a custom recipe on ifttt.com. If you come up with anything interesting I'd love to see it.
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:14:19
Gotcha. Ok, then according to btcee99's most recent post, it looks like you entered a previously-used address into Bitcoin Megaphone, which is why it immediately thought its "Total Received" number was its tip amount.
But it's strange because I made that site, and I require custom addresses to have a zero total received balance before being used. There's probably a bug in my code somewhere. I'll investigate. In any case, thanks for bringing this to my attention, and I'm sorry for the confusion! 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:35:55
I think I get it. So I just connect my Twitter and Coinbase accounts, so when people view my public bitinfluence URL, they can just pay me? Seems pretty straightforward.
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:54:03
Good suggestion, thanks. I just deleted some of the obvious early tests. I kept some gibberish tests in there though, just to help show the concept. There will probably be lots of garbage posts in the future as people experiment.
What to post? Up to you, but you could include a URL if you'd like. It won't get hyperlinked, but it could be a good traffic driver if you're the first URL ever posted here!
Thanks for using the site!

If people have donated money to my public address, how do I generate a private key and receive it?

I see your point and agree that big publishers can be obtrusive in their efforts to drive revenue.
But I think you're jumping the gun with your response. Sites like Ars and Wired wouldn't pander unless it was effective. And right now, that's not the case with the Bitcoin donation addresses I see on the web. (IE, I see next to nothing when I inspect the tip addresses on blockchain.info.)
I'd like to see Bitcoin adoption rise to the point where it was effective for these big publishers to take Bitcoin seriously. We can't know if we don't try.
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:21:56

Woah, that's brilliant. I might do this after first sending him .0001 a few times, making it look like I can't tell the difference between the send amount and the transaction fee... Then I'll say I'm giving up and he can try it from my account.

Totally agree how user un-friendly Bitcoin is at the moment. The one exception is Coinbase, which I've been using as a merchant and a consumer and I think they've totally nailed it. Whenever someone I know is curious about Bitcoin, I tell them about Coinbase.

Awesome, thanks! Makes sense. 
I wonder what the better way is... I suppose Blockchain's makes the most sense when thinking about it from a "total money" standpoint, but Insight's approach makes sense from a technical standpoint.
Maybe Insight should add another field for something like "Total Collected" to make it more like Blockchain's?

Mostly because I'm lazy. Rather than learn how to generate a nice string of random numbers, I could just create some bitcoin addresses, strip away the 1s at the beginning, and be done with it!
@_date: 2014-06-09 17:15:42
Wow - thanks for the explanation! Very helpful.
One more follow-up if you don't mind... Are there any other uses for the days destroyed statistic, other than to help exchanges price the market?
Also, days destroyed is such an unhelpful name. I feel like better terminology could help increase Bitcoin adoption. Maybe we should rally to call it something more helpful, like "dormancy level" or something else?
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:26:33
I've heard that repeated a lot - "If SHA256 is broken we'd have bigger things to worry about." I agree it's probably true, since I understand SHA256 is widely used, but can anyone provide an example of what else we'd have to worry about?

Why are you doing this?
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:17:51
Well maybe not a key feature, but it's important to know how long an order has been open when considering whether to cancel it.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:58:56
Agree! That's why I wrote a bot to trade for me. It works on code, not emotion. :-) It cancels unfilled orders after an hour before reevaluating whether to place another. I like to check up on the bot by looking at the GDAX web interface, and it's helpful to see if an order is 59 minutes old, I know it's about to get canceled. I could monitor this elsewhere, but it's a little nicety I got from GDAX, which I guess is gone with Coinbase Pro. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:13:49
Yeah that’s probably the safest option, as long as you’re good at physically securing your storage.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:09:42
Good question. I’m not aware of any dangerous wallets specifically, but if you’re using a good wallet on a compromised computer you risk having your btc stolen.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:19:20
When you really care, say it with Bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:29:56
That's certainly more safe. The only 2 downsides are that 1: you'll have to pay the standard mining fees transferring the money in and out of Coinbase (just a few bucks now, but maybe you'll miss it more when BTC is +$100,000 :-p). And 2, you'll need to make sure you're using a secure wallet. Mobile wallets are pretty good. Desktop wallets on Windows machines are very dangerous.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:26:24

Thanks! I started with Wordpress and hardened/hacked it with a bunch of custom php.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:16:30
Very true. But taking that point further, the assumption is that a Bitcoin address is created exclusively for a specific Bitcoin Megaphone post. Which means any future funds it receives can be considered a tip for that post.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:27:34
Yeah, lots of similarities in terms of the "land grab" aspect. But the biggest difference is that people who post can get actual BTC tips, in addition to driving traffic to a URL. (Full disclosure - I built the site)
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:10:18
I see how you might think that, but it's incorrect. When making a post and using a bitcoin address of your choosing for the tip address and permalink, the requirement is that the address 1) must have a zero balance, and 2) cannot be used elsewhere on Bitcoin Megaphone.

I'll give you a hint - it starts with a 5 :-p
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:31:26
I'll give you two reasons. First, you'll likely get more reach posting to the front page of Bitcoin Megaphone than if you posted it somewhere else. And second, you message's permalink is a Bitcoin address where you can collect 100% of the tips anonymously.
@_date: 2015-02-04 12:23:15
This might sound like a dumb question, but why?
@_date: 2015-02-13 02:46:12
You should mess around on Bitcoin Megaphone.
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:58:34
The idea is you'd get more exposure than posting somewhere else for free. It's gotten a good deal of press:

ok, I will be honest... I am here for the tips :)My mom doesn't believe that I will make ANY money with all this bitcoin thing!I WILL give half of what you tip to those in need!
Another hint - the 3 posts I chose don't have any line breaks.
