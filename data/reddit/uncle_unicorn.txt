Apparently, according to a poster on here who went to college with Ross he never used to wear deodorant. They used to work out together at the gym in the mornings and the guy said he hated having Ross as a spotter as he truly reeked. That said, he said everything everyone else says about him - that he was truly brilliant and would totally lose everyone around him when he was theorising about things as he was crazy intelligent. The rest of the time he used to walk around in hippy sandals and sleeveless wife beater type singlets and was generally a happy chappy who everyone liked who loved chilling out, smoking joints and eating pizza with the guys.

If they made ones that buzz every time the BTC rate drops it would double as a sexy butt plug and eventually become more popular than the iPhone.

I agree with this. Just buy a new one for 125 bucks and transfer the BTC immediately.

I don't think Louis actually answers those emails, his tech geek does.

Or maybe don't live in America whilst doing all of the above.
