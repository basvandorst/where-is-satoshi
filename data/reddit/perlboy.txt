Confirmed by more than one source now. Whether it actually means money flow is going to be restored we'll wait and see.

But... It's not a slide from a bank... Notice the reference to "JonesLink" ? I'm going to take a punt that is a reference to Edward Jones' ( internal resource.
Who is Edward Jones?
"Founded in 1922, we are a full-service brokerage firm and a private partnership – a structure that we believe gives us the independence to make long-term decisions that are in the best interests of our clients and associates, without the pressures publicly traded companies face to meet short-term earnings forecasts."
And of course, being financial advisors they have legal obligations (and commission structures ;)) to stick to.

Umm, so KYC &amp; AML enforcement is a difficult thing to do. The more you disclose what your flags are the more the launderers will try and ensure they don't hit your flags. Within the banking industry this is a very common thing to do (not publish specifics).

Ahh, sorry didn't realise it was posted already. Will delete.

I've been doing Bitcoin investment as a business for a few years now but, like you, on the personal side I've been "saving" in BTC. Essentially, every week or so I wander down to the local BTC ATM, feed the spare cash in my wallet into the machine and send it to cold storage. It's only $100 here and there but overtime I've ended up with a chunk of BTC stored away and not actively traded..

It scares me reading how some people use a bash command line...
rm -rf /etc/init/start.conf
Like.. was there ANY requirement to forcibly and recursively delete part of the init system? For that matter, rm -rf as a default use of rm... Amateur hour...

&lt;Deleted&gt; No it's real.

17% interest and 30% loan to value ratio is crazy high, like, higher than payday lenders in Australia and only MARGINALLY cheaper than a credit card (which doesn't come with an LVR). There are very few reasons someone would do this rather than sell their BTC for cash and go talk to a bank. As it stands Helio is offering up to $100K loans which is far away from any possible house purchase price so I guess it's a holiday loan.... 
This looks highly opportunistic and I can't fathom why anyone would do this....
