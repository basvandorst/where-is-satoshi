Do you know if the amount stolen is over/under $1.000.000?

Yes what? He knows, or you know and it is?

Look at my argument, and then back at yours. 
They have closed down alot of vipps account because of fraud. 
they have helped people hide money, untill they got cought. 
logic dictates they are anti bitcoin because of fraud, not money laundering. The former affects their bottom line, the latter doesn't.

What is here is my opinion? 
I know that vipps is credit not debit. 
I know they are currently losing money on it (they said so themselves) 
I know they helped people hide money (google it, panama papers, they even publically apologized and started an internal investigation)
And percentages only go to 100%..

1. You do know Bitcoinsnorway uses DNB as their bank? 
2. DNB has nothing against bitcoin in their TOS. Their public view on bitcoin is neutral. 
Vipps on the other hand uses credit, and therefore they ban bitcoin from it. It's not a higher money-laundering risk. However, it's at a lot higher fraud risk. Which leads to the conclusion that they ban it because it's high risk, not because of money laundering. 
They allow it on their banking sites, but not with their credit prosessor. The ONLY difference between the 2 is security, so it's pretty obvious that they ban it for security reasons. 
I haven't said anything that would indicate that i'm trolling, and you are trying to claim that only to gain the "high ground" which is kind of low...i'm trying to have a civil discussion here.

This is not going to last! 
These guys used to take anonymous paypal payments untill they figured out paypal was reversible. 
Vipps is a credit-transfer, and against DNB TOS because of high fraud risk. I give it 2-3 days before they stop accepting vipps payments, or, if they sell enough, they announce they are shutting down..

I am 100% certain it's about fraud and not money laundering. How? Because i know of several cases where it has been used for fraud. The app literally lets you just send someone money by typing in their phone number. No bank-id, passwords or anything. You only need their phone. ALOT of people don't have passwords on their phones or the code "1,1,1,1"
DNB has gotten rid of all security measures to make vipps convenient and superior to competitors (from the consumer perspective) They are burning money, and betting on making it back later when they stop aggressively growing. 
DNB doesn't care about money laundering....they even set up an office in luxemburg helping norwegians hide money and create shell-corporations. Remember the panama papers? DNB wishes you didn't. 
And ofcourse their gonna blame it on anti-money laundering efforts. Do you really believe they are going to say "Yes, we have invested heavily in this project, but we have major issues with fraud"?

How does it not apply to long positions? That is rediculous. If you bought, say, 100.000 bfx, you bough them. doesn't matter thay you have outstanding obligations to the BTC/USD margin lenders, you still own whatever you bought. That would be like saying stocks don't give out dividends if you owe the bank money. Where did that logic come from?

I actually closed my position before the announcement, so i didn't lose anything. I can't really se anyone complaining if they closed you $1 token USD position and give you $1. That's litterally just giving you the IOU money. 
I think the whole thing is extremely shady. From giving customers haircuts when there is money left in the company (they paid out about $800.000 in outstanding tokens, that money should have gone to the people receiving the haircuts, not the ones now holding the tokens.) Making them tradable at all was also extremely shady. And now claiming the tokens are worthless if you borrowed money to buy them, wth? If i bought $100.000 in coca cola stock using a bank loan, should coca cola tell me to pay my bank loan before they give me dividends? That's insane.
