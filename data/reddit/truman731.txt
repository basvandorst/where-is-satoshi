I am not saying it's not. I don't have any BCH but the lack of communication between seems to have the two communities thinking that the other group is full of idiots

Talk to them. Any questions they ask will actually be really helpful because if you don't know you will be able to learn more. It will be a learning experience and you will be able to solidify your opinions

Can someone explain this to me

If this doesn't hit the top I don't wanna be part of this subreddit anymore

Second fact is a fact

Is there anything like this that can text you? Or an app with notifications?
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:04:26
Yeah I'm more looking for an alert of 5% within a 24 hour period.  As I expect Bitcoin to slowly gain ground setting a price every day is kinda a pain

Do you think the other side believes in their currency enough to hold no matter what, or are they just hoping for a flip? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:40:56
No thanks Allan

Either you're trying to scare people or something is seriously wrong here 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:13:27
