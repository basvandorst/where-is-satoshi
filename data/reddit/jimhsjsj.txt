The Twitter likes and FB likes have blown up in the last week since the store and bonus clicks have been implemented. At this rate it would double in about a month.

These kind of clips are going to be as big as 'what's the Internet?' Someday. I am amazed constantly how this guy is popular and I have come to the conclusion that his dithering bearded behaviour makes weak minded people think he's smart. When actually he's just a bearded dithering idiot.

The store I think just gives complete newbies the idea that they can actually get something tangible with Gemz otherwise they would just be like points in a game that have no value....it serves a purpose. 
What I'm a believer in is how compelling it is to invite friends and market the app through likes on FB etc now. Before it's wasn't ready to share but now it is IMO which is why we have seen a pretty rapid uptick, 10,000 users is a decent base to build from. My hunch is we wil double to 20,000 in a month or two and possibly be around 50,000-100,000 at year end. It looks like classic early viral uptick to me.

Name one that pays you to use it and let's you send crypto money through it as easy as a text?

Sorry you make no sense, it's a counterparty wallet, the app is encrypted as is the wallet???
it's therefore as safe as any Bitcoinwallet.

I agree with the article. But I live in Korea, I had extreme Asthma but after visiting a doctor here they checked me for allergies and I was positive for house/dust mites, which are commonly found in feather duvets, feather coats and just in homes generally. they gave me jab. I had a night of feeling like I was Spider-Man with my body throbbing like something was happening and the next day all symptoms were gone permanently. I see almost no body in Korea with inhalers like in the west. I hope some people see this and a few find this is the solution for them too, God Bless.

I get your scepticism. But I think you need to download the newest version of the app, takes a minute and see how well they have set the store and bonus up. It's kind of addictive to log in and get your daily bonus. Plus they have implemented the store now so people can actually buy something with the gems. Don't believe anything someone tells you, I'm suggesting you look yourself.

For goodness sake just get her to download this app, the Bitcoin wallet could be used by a 5 year old and sending coins is also as easy as sending a text. Then send some BTC to her. Why make a simple payment system complicated? Bitcoiners think they need to explain the system to people, does the average person understand the technology of Visa payments....geez.

Every messenegr app had an early build up stage. go look at how long Whatsapp, snapchat etc needed to build up momentum. So far Getgems has successfully followed this early pattern. IT takes time to build up to say 50,000 users but once it does, 100,000 and then 500,000 and then 1,000,000 happens more easily than people think, it's the early stage getting to around 20,000 that's the struggle.  there are literally 50 or so chat apps with over a million users, it won't be that hard to achieve that. So suddenly you have a million plus complete newbies with Bitcoin wallets, your not seeing how this is a gateway to the masses?
Ok so have you spent less than a minute actually downloading the app? If you want to have an opinion be bothered to take 30 seconds of effort, geez. So the app rewards in gems various tasks that make the app viral as hell. You get like 25 gems which is soon gonna be worth a dollar or two for every friend you click to invite downloads. You get gems for liking the gems FB page, Twitter page, inviting what's app users......it goes on and on how much potential this app has to go viral. And the point is looking at the quickening uptake that potential is starting to be realised.
Download it before you have another smart opinion based on nothing.

For storage it is but yeah I think the app wallet is a hive wallet, which seems like just another legit well known wallet. Sometimes you need to be suspicious but this is not the time. The developers plastered their identities all over the project and have had high profile interviews, they are not going to run off with anyone's money.

Your concerns are one of a technician, this is for the masses who simply don't care about the issues you are concerned with.
