So If I downloaded this software 2 days ago, will I be vulnerable to this attack?

Slush, you can't change the world to make yourself comfortable. Chinese win this war because their cost is lower. Similarly, your trezor sells for $99, and you can't see it's an excuse that Chinese can produce same things with much lower cost to urge people to boycott them.
It's free market. It's freedom.
Although I dislike Chinese miners. I think they are stupid and greedy and short-sighted.

Don't worry. Bitcoin is always there. The price will not soar immediately. You can kindly wait a while and buy then. The price then may be better.
@_date: 2016-11-16 08:39:44
I was banned by because I told Troll Ver to be a good man, instead of a troll. As far as I know, there is heavy censorship in and many bitcoiners have been banned for supporting Bitcoin. It's such a weird joke if moderators in say they hate "censorship". In fact, they only hate "being censored". 
Troll Ver keeps telling lies in and is always abusive to others. So I suggest to ban Troll Ver and I suggest Reddit admin suspend his account.

You will be in trouble legally if you receive $20k from gambling sites directly. Also, you have to give much to IRS.
So It's better to receive through Bitcoin, and sell bitcoin for cash via localbitcoins.
PS: It's advice academically. In fact, you are illegal since you gamble online. I don't gamble. But I think gambling is moral, at least to some extent.

Payment in alibaba (aliexpress) is always an issue. Hope they can add Bitcoin as a payment method soon. Although I doubt it because they don't want to be troll to China Government (but it's international payment... Uhh...).   (ALIBABA charges at least 3% per transaction because they have to pay it to credit card companies.)
However, it's nearly impossible to find such a service to can help you pay the order on aliexpress. 
You could ask the merchant to leave their taobao (alibaba c2c in China)
Assuming you can speak Chinese.
You could open a taobao account to pay for taobao order. How can you get Chinese currency? Localbitcoins or China exchanges or Friends.
But I have to say, it's troublesome if you are foreigners even if you can speak Chinese
Assuming you can't speak Chinese.
You send btc to China exchange and sell it for RMB, and withdraw to bank account in China, and use it to pay orders on taobao.
It's too complicated. And you need a bank account in China.
Assuming you can't speak Chinese.
Or you can send btc to your friend in China and then he will pay the taobao order for you directly. 
It's also not easy to have such a friend.
So call/email alibaba to ask them to add bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-18 03:11:05
Have you tried to search them on DHGATE. it's similar to aliexpress. And many merchants open accounts on both platform.
Same procedure. And payment in DHGATE is much easier.

However, as for me, Satoshi does not think it's possible to make these completely trustless, that is, as for me satoshi does not think every user shall be always equal.
He said in the future normal users would not download blockchain and they shall rely on big institute who runs the node.
That is, the "trustless" Satoshi proposes is that there are many nodes running by millions of institutes including large merchants. And average joe could rely on any of them. It's not his proposal that most user be expert on bitcoin.

USD prints 2.8% every year on average, but all other major countries print more every year. So USD has been the steadiest currency in the history.
For example, Chinese currency prints 25-30% every year in the past 40 years. Price of real estate in Beijing China has soared by 2000% in the past 10 years
The depreciation of Chinese currency is unavoidable. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 20:17:01

Hey, per my understanding, "client-only mode" is "only" for the convenience of end users. It has no relation to "small payments".
With "client-only mode", end user still use local bitcoin software to create same tx as today.
