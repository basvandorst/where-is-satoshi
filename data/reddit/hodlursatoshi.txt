1. put money on coinbase
2. sign in at gdax
3. click on deposit and select your coinbase account
4. buy with a limit order (no fee)
If you make a market order you'll pay .3% on fees, which is still better than using coinbase directly.

1) right now there is a hashrate of about [12'000'000 Th/s](
2) One of the most powerful machines right now is the Antminer s9 with 13TH/s. It's sold out but it was [$1445](
3) To get 51% of the network you'd need to add another 12'000'000 TH/s, so about a million s9's or $1.5 billion (just for the machines). For an attack these machines would consume 1300 megawatts, so you'd need your own nuclear power plant to run it. It's just not worth it.

Thank god I'm not american.

don't know about an app, but if you're on a computer you can transfer between coinbase and gdax. (gdax is coinbase owned)

but he could only dump, not pump

Kraken doesn't charge fees for SEPA and their buying fee is in percent, so it doesn't matter how much you buy. There may be a minimum though.
Problem is, they currently charge 0.001 btc (€8,50) as a withdrawal fee. (just for btc; to send € back to your bank account it's 9 cents) For €10 a month I would just leave it on the exchange. That's totally acceptable for small amounts, but make sure to enable 2 factor authentication.

just deposit it to a foreign exchange and withdraw it again. New addresses, new coins :)

[there will be an extra layer eventually. ]( )
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:29:57
how much btc did you get?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:19:19
nah it's just the 10€ bill redesigned, because that's what it's worth as of today

me: "I rather cook spaghetti instead of buying fancy food. Saves me some bucks"
also me: "Dropping another grand on bitcoin? Yeah because why fucking not?" lol
p.s. am a student, so a grand is a lot

You only get the $10 if someone registers and buys $100 or more using your referral link.

Don't forget that net neutrality is only a problem in the US (for now) and BTC-USD is only ~28% of the market.

It's dropping because people who were betting on s2x move to bch.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:28:31
that's the thing. coinbase, kraken and gemini were all down. Any other suggestions?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:56
btceur dropped €2.5k in 1min and is back up again. That's the rollercoaster I signed up for
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:46:08
More like $150
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:35
where did you send it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:43:36
not anymore lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:05:50
Do you mean the one 45min ago or was there another one?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:52:12
kraken too. That's rediculous
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:50:50
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:05:31
You mean Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:04:07
Well it's not that easy. The transaction is being broadcasted, so the taxi driver sees it in his wallet. It's just not confirmed immediately.

Changing one coin to another is treated the same as changing crypto to fiat. You'd have to wait a year between the trades to avoid taxation.
