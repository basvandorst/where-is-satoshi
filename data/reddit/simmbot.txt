That's fine. Does minimum diligence entail discovery of a zero-day exploit?

Fork is completely within the terms of Ethereum, I don't see what the issue is or why people want him to keep his/her stolen money. If the attacker didn't like the terms of Ethereum, he shouldn't have put his money into a system where a consensus of miners can elect to revoke his stolen funds.

It was absolutely a hack. The definition of a hack, from my understanding as a software engineer, is the exploitation of a loophole in a system. The more relevant questions are if it was a legal hack, if it was an ethical hack, if a hard fork is a legal response to the hack, and if a hard fork is an ethical response to the hack.

This is crazier than the original commenter. You're denying that it was even a *loophole*.
The DAO creators' intent was NOT to allow anyone to drain ether from the DAO, creatively or otherwise. If this was their intent, they would not have assigned Curators to protect ether outflows.

loophole in code == hack

I know the context. I'm explaining the definition of a hack. Some people have great difficulty calling this a hack. Nevertheless, it was a hack. The definition of "hack" is divorced from morality or law, it only relates to the divergence between what the code allows and what the coder intended.
But since you mention it, let's define "due diligence". Due diligence means taking reasonable steps to approximate of the risk of investment. The actual risk can never be known precisely, it can only be approximated. Due diligence does not mean that you can predict the future, or that you are an oracle who knows there is a zero-day exploit in the contract code.

A different perspective is that smart contracts exist within a system that, by its very nature, can be altered by consensus. In other words, smart contracts implicitly allow majority vote as a means of arbitration.

Whether it's a hack depends on the coder's intent. Terms do not codify intent. What you're arguing is that it was both a *legal* hack and an *acceptable* hack. So just call it that.

The recursive-call type of vulnerability became known a week or so before the exploit. The specific attack vector in the DAO code became known when the attacker exploited it. It was a zero-day exploit.
