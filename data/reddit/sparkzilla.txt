Hi Brayton, does Boost make larger Bitcoin investments? 10-15K is not enough for my project.

I am actually working on this right now at my crowdsourced news site, Newslines. Right now we use PayPal to pay our writers $1 for every post they write on our site. Posts are collated to make biographies and timelines, for example:
Mt Gox newsline: 
Roger Ver newsline: 
We are expanding our payment system to let people earn smaller amounts for smaller tasks, for example, fixing a spelling error, or for adding a comment. Those tasks might only be worth $0.25 or less, so Bitcoin is the ideal way to pay out. 
The problem is that while everyone has a PayPal account, not that many ordinary people have Bitcoin accounts (yet).

I interviewed Mark Karpeles in May 2013. The first thing I did after I left the meeting was tell my friend, a guy who has worked for big banks all his life, that he should apply for a job at Mt Gox because it was very obvious they had no oversight whatsoever and needed someone like him to make sure they complied with basic financial software standards. He didn't apply.
