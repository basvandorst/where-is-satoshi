Let's say you have a $100 bill in your pocket and it slips out without you noticing while you're taking out your phone. You keep walking, with no idea that your bill is flying in the wind in the opposite direction. You continue on with your day. You were just out on a lunch break grabbing a bite to eat and now you're heading back to your office. You get to the office. You don't get much work done, but that's a whole other story (you don't really like your job). After work, you take the subway home, as you usually do. It's cheaper than driving, and you can read a book, a win-win situation really. You get home later, and remember that you don't have any food for dinner. You look around to see if there's anything you can rustle up, but no. So you jump in the car (you have a car but just prefer to take the subway to work) and go to the store. You walk around the store, but your mind is on this meeting you have tomorrow and your absolute prick of a boss, he just doesn't get it. Anyway, eventually you settle on frozen pizza, not all that healthy, but will get the job done and you don't need to do much work to prepare it, which is why you didn't go for chicken. Anyway, I digress, let's get back to the point. You go to pay and BOOM: you're missing $100. Damn! That sux! You go home, eat the pizza, and feel generally quite miserable. The next day, after the big meeting (which didn't go well, f*king boss), you find out that you're probably going to lose your job soon. That really puts the pressure on, you could really use that $100, every $1 counts. You call up the federal reserve to tell them of the mistake and see if they can help you, but they say no they can't. You think to yourself "cash really has to get this stuff figured out before it can take off".
