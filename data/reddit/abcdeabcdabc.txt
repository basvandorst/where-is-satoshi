Nobody knows what it means, but it's provocative!

The point is who cares if he took out a loan to buy bitcoin. If he had taken out the loan to buy anything else (that is guaranteed to be worth zero eventually), people would think it's completely normal.

There's a strip club in Vegas that operates completely on crypto

For those talking about fees and slow transaction times - Legends made their own currency called LGD which you buy using Bitcoin or cash. You use LGD for transactions inside the club. If you hold $5000 worth of LGD you have a membership which gives you free admission, entrance into a special members area, and other perks.

Almost all consumer loans are used to purchase depreciating "assets." Who do you think took a better risk, a guy who takes out a loan to buy a boat, or a guy who takes out a loan to buy bitcoin? At least one of those two has a POSSIBILITY of going up.

Wrong. You obviously haven't read Satoshi's whitepaper. The very first page says that Bitcoin was designed to be a payment system.

Or just have a hardware wallet and store a backup of the seed in a lockbox (at a bank) or in a pgp container with a memorized passphrase.

Are you really from the US?

Yeah that's what I was referring to. It has to be intentional.

I sent someone money for drugs and put "not drugs" and they allowed it! Idiots.

Sell the Bitcoin on Coinbase then buy back in anonymously somewhere else like Bisq.

For those hoping Bitcoin will help you escape the rat race, the answer is no.

Buy a ledger wallet, install a copy of ledger live on their phone and they can monitor your wallet without risk if their phone getting compromised and coins lost. You install it on your phone or computer too and coins can only be spent when you connect the actual hardware wallet. You can receive and check the balance any time with only your phone.

I just find it weird that they named it Libra after Gemini was launched, and we know about their past differences.
@_date: 2019-04-23 00:46:27
Absolute cheapest - memorize the seed
Second cheapest - print the seed on paper
Pretty cheap - put the seed in an encrypted text file on a couple USB drives and place in different locations

That's why I said not sure of your situation, but here's an option that might work. You're welcome. For me and a lot of others, this is a solution.
@_date: 2019-04-27 06:25:08
Not sure what your situation is, looks like bitrefill is an option for a lot of people. ��
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:29:09
You can do this through bitrefill.com

I agree, fuck banks and taxes. I'm just saying as Bitcoin becomes more popular, this is a pretty significant issue to address. There needs to be a simple system in place to deal with it. In fact, as people get older and get more risk averse, they will be hesitant to own Bitcoin if they cannot be assured that it is safe and that it will 100% sure end up with their children and not be lost.

Says who? I know a lot of friends who are entrepreneurs, dentists, doctors, engineers, and lawyers all mid thirties with at least a few hundred thousand net worth, most with 1-2 kids already, who I have discussed getting into Bitcoin with. Some of them I know have. What if they get killed in an accident, have a freak heart attack (stressful jobs), etc.

I just spent 2 hours typing this in over and over again in Google on my phone. Hope it works.

Make sure you're never in the same place together with either of those family members in case you both get taken out in a freak accident.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:46:52
That's like saying never live in a nice house, drive a nice car, or wear a luxury watch.

Because every place where you can buy Bitcoin is a separate exchange with different buyers and sellers.  It's like going to a grocery store; they all might have apples for sale but sold at different prices. There could be a guy on Localbitcoins willing to sell for $7k but then on Coinbase the lowest someone is willing to sell their Bitcoin is at $7.5k, so you'll see price discrepancies.

Homeowners insurance + auto insurance claims. Maybe talk to a lawyer first before putting in the claims, they can guide you and interface with the insurance company.

If you want mass adoption (basically what this whole sub wants), it needs to be simple.

This is going to be a huge issue. Now, with banks, most everything is recorded and can be easily located and processed in probate. There are going to be lots of people with Bitcoin that die and that coin will never be recovered. Especially younger people without estate plans who die prematurely.
Perhaps setting up a dead man's switch that checks in with you every 6 months to a year and when activated sends part of your seed to a few select family members who can piece it together.

Look on Craigslist for in-person deals for cash.

If you think the value will increase more than the cost of fees, go for it.

Ledger Live, when not connected to your physical hardware wallet, just shows your balance based on the public Blockchain. You could install Ledger Live on your phone too, it's safe. Your wallet is on the actual hardware device. The seed phrase you wrote down is another copy of your hardware wallet but less secure since it can be opened without a PIN, so guard that even more securely than your hardware wallet. So, it's safe to keep ledger live on both your computer and phone if you want, coins cannot ever move without either the hardware wallet + PIN or the seed phrase.
