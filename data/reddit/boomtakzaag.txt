As long as people value a form of money, that form of money will be valuable.


The point of the video was that - like bitcoins - there is a limited number of gold available. If your thinking of someone stumbling on a huge amount of gold and keeping it secret to the rest of the public; that could only feasable work with very tiny amounts of gold, irrelevant to the global economy. [This]( is quite diffecult to hide.


Energy is everywhere. Internet is everywhere where people are. In situations where energy and internet are not available there are far bigger concerns to be dealt with than a lack of currency.

This seems eerie similar to students at different universities mocking each other.

What exactly don't you understand? 
It is also in general wise when you don't understand a line of text, to read the next line of text.

The thing is still dont understand:
"We have invented a secure way of entering the PIN so it can’t be keylogged and misused."
How do you enter the pin? On the computer or the device (2 buttons?)? 
If the pin isnt somehow entered on the device, then I could just keylog your strokes and steal the device (or not)?
edit: In the video on their website the user doesnt have to enter a pin in order to authenticate a transaction; wouldnt that imply that I could just crack open the trezor and audit the embedded computer to extract the privatekeys?

I'm not a 1:1 anarchist but denying the anarchistic principles of the bitcoin project is rather hypocritical.

Thanks for the answer (idem for Magikazam). 
That's some neat solution.
