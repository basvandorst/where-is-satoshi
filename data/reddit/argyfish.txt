If you have a plan that you can propose publicly, with solid steps outlined that you can realistically achieve then it is a different matter. If you want people to donate money, bitcoin or even something like food, for any purpose, you need transparency and a way to prove what you are doing is worth my donating to you. 
Just writing online somewhere that you would consider doing something charitable with an anonymous donation won't get you anywhere. If you are ardent on changing the world, as you seem to convey in the tone of your post, you should go out and set up some kind of organization or group that devotes time to figuring out the best way to make a positive impact in the world. 
Then, when you have a solid plan and achievable ideas that are worth people donating to, you have a good chance of getting funded.
Not trying to ruin your optimism, but this is the internet and people are going to be naturally skeptical of posts that are asking for bitcoins without any clear indication of what they are going to do with it (and simply answering "I will do good" is too vague).
Nonetheless, I wish you the best of luck in what you want to change, and we could indeed use more positivity like yours in the world.

TL;DR - overly-optimistic sob story about how OP will change the world if you donate him some Bitcoins

Haha, thanks! Guess I gotta go spend it on supporting  - don't worry I'm a 'genuine soul'.
