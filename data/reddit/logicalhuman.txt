Look into what your high school offers! My high school offered AP Computer Science with 0 programming knowledge and I learned a lot from class! I had to take another computer science course in college and I flew through that class because of the knowledge I gained from my high school course.
If your high school doesn’t offer anything just learn everything online. There are free resources online that you can learn from.

When I was in 8th or 9th grade or something (I’m 19 now) I really wanted to get into bitcoin. My dad wouldn’t let me spend my money on it but he was okay with me mining it. So I set up his computer to mine it because it had a better GPU than mine, and unfortunately he claimed it ended up slowing it down (even though the mining software wasn’t running??) so I had to stop after a few days. His GPU wasn’t that great but I ended up making like .00000003 bitcoin or something, if that means anything.
Sometimes I wonder how my life would be different right now if I had a better computer at that time. Oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I just started getting into stocks and crypto and decided to invest in AMD. Lucky me :o

Kinda cool how it rises each time tensions with NK increases. Maybe we can break $10,000 if WW3 starts!

The point of these institutions is to keep the economy and USD as stable as possible. And also in the US government you have checks and balances, hence why new laws about banks were put in place after the 2008 recession.
If the whole system becomes corrupt, that’s another thing. Either way, there’s no way bitcoin is actually “regulated and real” vs the US dollar. The past 24 hours proves that. Look how fast Bitcoin has grown and crashed. Hell, look at the last hour. The US dollar doesn’t do that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:33:18
Uhh... remember Mt. Gox? You just need one huge exchange (or several) to fuck up and cause a huge crash. The reason why the USD is stable (and bitcoin) is because the Federal Reserve controls and regulates the economy and banks. Bitcoin can come crashing down just as fast (if not faster) as it went up.
Nothing he says is actually unreasonable.

I don’t think he misunderstood, he’s just comparing big financial institutions (and used banks as an example) to Crypto exchanges.
If GDAX/coinbase was hacked and everyone lost their bitcoin tomorrow, the value of bitcoin would plummet. The exchanges are just as big in the crypto world as the banks are in the irl economy.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:34:52
That’s what people do. They use bitcoin as a stock.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:23:32
The Federal Reserve regulates the US dollar and economy so it keeps a stable value. Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, has no controlling agent or institution which allows it to be extremely volatile.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:26:20
This is the issue with bitcoin. Supporters want it to become an actual currency, but how can it become a stable currency people are willing to spend if people just treat it like a stock and hold?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:33:30
Ah sorry I think we both agree with each other lol. I didn’t see the last part saying “waving currencies are the future” and thought you were confused about the stable price of USD part.
But yes, there’s no way bitcoin can be used to bought commodities and such, not yet at least.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:35:24
Except it’s used as a stock right now.

Depends whether or not ISP’s throttled bitcoin websites/exchanges... Or decided to implement some extra bitcoin trading/mining package. It’s possible.

Any places to read stuff like this? Subreddits, websites?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:35:34
I mean he’s not wrong. Bitcoin can crash as fast as its risen, and there’s no centralized authority controlling it. While that may have its perks in some aspects, there’s nothing keeping bitcoin actually stable (hence why it’s rising so fast).
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:56:41
Your bitcoins wouldn’t be, but a lot of other people’s would be. And what determines the value of bitcoin? Only people’s perception of the value. And a huge event like that would bring that value waaay down (just like how any huge crypto event affects the value). And just like people’s cash in the 1920’s wouldn’t be worth as much, your $10,000 bitcoins (which are kept privately) would now be worth $2,000 or something.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:30:58
That’s not true? If I hold 1,000 dollars it’s not going to become 10,000 dollars in 6 months (or however long it’s been for bitcoin). If I buy a Tesla for $100,000 it will still be worth $100,000 in 6 months.

What if I sell and buy back during the dip with the money I got when I sold? Is that viable or should I just hodl?

Why is it wrong to assume that maybe the US-North Korea conflict creates chaos in that region, causing stock markets to go down, and more people to lose trust in fiat currency/government, and thus to buy into Bitcoin? It seems like a trend that whenever global chaos/conflict increases in areas Bitcoin is popular in, the value of Bitcoin thus increase.
I think that’s definitely plausible and that exact reasoning has been thrown around a lot in this subreddit as well.
