Go is a cleaner (simpler) language to grok then c or c++.
I'm just waiting to see who is the first altcoin to release on btcd instead of bitcoin core.

The bilked who got into mining after ASICs are just as likely to spend or sell the bitcoins as there is little comfort in risking a price decrease which only adds to pernicious volatility.

Hell no,
There are two reoccurring economic factors being played out again and again in Bitcoin.
1. Global Economy strength...
      Global Economies are Recovering So This Is A Non Plus for the Bitcoin as an international payment vehicle.
      Not a deal ender, just not as sparkly anymore to the eyes of the beholders of stores of value.
2.  Mining profits Influences the price of Bitcoin
    If miners cannot afford to risk a decrease in prices they have to sell to realize the best or least risky gains or reduction of losses.
 
These two issues are the most responsible for the price increase in the first place if we review the  news / hype cycle history in the runup from $40 - $1200
1. The Cyprus Banking Crisis sets off a Panic and speculative buying on bitcoins starts on the belief that it could become a recognized global reserve currency.... never proven to be adopted en mass by cypriots but speculation persists because of the US and Chinese Currency war, Greece and the Euro Zone defaults as a real risk and China not making a comment about bitcoin until ~$800 USD per coin which ambiguous at best which let the price rise more until they starting talking about controls and thats when the price plunges started, more interpretation and recoveries in price and the more talk of controls, rinse and repeat.
2. ASICs arrive on the market bolstering network security and huge gains for early receivers - but... truly expensive for those who units arrive late or never at all or just walked in way too late with high expectations.
These are the reasons for the continued price decline.  The Chinese exchange OKCoin (I could be wrong) just released longer term financial instruments for users to collect interest on.  In this market interest will only soften the loss but not hedge against if the users hold on to these instruments.. they are not better off than the miners who bought hardware they can not capitalize on.  
However the issue on the effects of short selling instruments and the affect on price could be a new factor in bitcoin.  Short selling was impossible until the last 9 months and now it is possible so this could have an effect that most normal market participants have not experienced enough to put into the normal assessment of bitcoin markets.

Never find the bottom only buy the rebounds.  Its better to compound your interest on small gains than risk your bankroll on finding "the bottom".

It is a node that provides all the details about transactions.
It uses good technology to achieve this.
Its like running blockchain info at home for your own uses to develop web applications that need detailed information about bitcoin information like sending money to other addresses.  This is helpful because most nodes only make the information easily available on addresses it sends money to or receives money from.  Toshi makes all the data available, even for transactions that you have nothing to do with.

*Invest in learning about and using bitcoin, not the currency as a store of value.*
People like Kaiser and even Antonopolis have a bad track record of pointing out the faults of Bitcoin to the point they act more like proper shills for the wolves of crypto.  I hate to say it but they will give a Wall St Big Bank a sincere lashing on the air and just avoid healthy non biased criticism on the state and culture of bitcoin.  Peoples treatment of Bitcoin vs State Backed Financial system is idealistic in the platonic sense at best but practically a pump to sell game for Bitcoin

You need to learn Risk managment more than trading if you are in charge of other peoples money.
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:06:44
I agree.

I will be back in November to check again.

And it was very small then and OkCoin has picked it up since... possibly more.
The point was not that this is brand new but relatively new market force.
I do concede though that this could be an engineered downturn by the Chinese players in the space but with gold and silver at lows indicate there are still more key global forces relevant to bitcoin at play.

So the real problem is Toshi is redundant... not a failure to innovate... as I am not sure what core part of their business technology is innovative except for the use of bitcoin in a rather simple brokerage + simple payments business plan.
It might have been an internal tool to get devs up to speed on bitcoin specifics... it does seem odd that they would hack blockchain explorer plus node on their own when suitable projects are already out there.

The way alibaba is structures is a conglomerate of businesses working together.  I would think they could still run an internal but independent payment processor for bitcoin only.  The trouble for them would be to find enough resources critical to the business to trade for bitcoins at a sustainable rate with and for the rest of the conglomerate.

Take a month to read only the negative articles, posts and comments on bitcoin not from the past but from here on out.  You will better know the risks associated with the current market conditions and you might be even better off reading about recessions and depressions in economics to understand more deeply the issues that come into play.
That said the warnings have been clear from longtime members but they usually get downvoted or even banned because the sub is more like a PR / Marketing channel for some religious bitcoiners.

When the "researcher" provides public data, hypothesis tested and methods of analysis then we can make our own conclusions with the data.  All good researchers would have probably just bundled relevant data together in the first place and if the guy or gal really had an in on the situation could have wiki leaked documents instead of jump on a public forum with questionable security practices despite the founders puppet shows.  The more I type the less i believe any of it.

It can be done but payment by phone seems just as practical.

I'd go with the miners liquidating and overall increased use of bitcoin making the holding period shorter increasing liquidity of the market.

The not thinking well is mostly because they are new to bitcoin in general and these people are most likely to think the latest hardware (and mining contracts) will still be an edge enough to at least pay them selves back*.  It would be interesting to see data on the actual paybacks at given times from the times of cpu mining to today.  If I had the the time I would do it myself.

Despite its size it is very well done
