Now I see 5, and that is not counting MaxKeiser as a MEME.
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:09:30
Where can I find this??

Will fund the accounts once Blokchain.info  goes back online. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DONT LOSE YOUR URLs.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:49:55
the ones necessary to have my voice heard.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:03:05
In my opinion does not need videos and cats to understand things, the community leaders here are among the smartest people in the IT industry. yet for some reason when they see a project, the just stay silent, while they could promote them.  Still what do I know, will follow your advice and create some videos.

watch the game for 3 minutes, is pretty self explanatory at that point.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:12:22
Thank you so much! I'm here if you have any questions.
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:05:11
We decided to just send that you win directly, that way we never hold too many coins in our hot wallet. It was a security decision.

No worries, the typo generated a bug on our system, it showed your payment as complete yet it was not the case.  We are fix this now, you will receive the payments as soon as we finish. Also looking into improving the verification of the addresses. Thank you for your help and patience!

hello Mr. President, I created this project  , can I send you my resume too. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:54:37
Please watch the game for 2 minutes, and  let me know again.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:27:21
I am not giving up, just re-thinking if I should be creating products around Bitcoin.

Thank you, we could consider an IPO if lots of people enjoy the game and when a decentralised exchange is trustworthy. I will not stand what happened to me, repeat to other people; it was very difficult.
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:28:42
I think is better you don't play, only smart people can win on this one.
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:10:47
check your wallet, and you should find your payouts now. Give the game another chance, we have improved many things!
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:14:30
sign up for an account, write your nickname here, and I will fund it so that you can try it for free. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:43:12
could you please confirm this is the wallet address you registered: 14Y7KjLkG71zpBS4xugorqrNNwzGMkfX21
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:43:36
Just checkout the game at  , you will get it in not time.
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:07:06
Trolls like "nobodybelievesyou" (see the first comment on this post), that are making sure only what they feel like reaches the front; while valuable contributions are left behind.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:48:32
Thank you for the feedback, will look into it. Yes, the winnings go directly each time you win. No need to cash out. We decided to do this for security reasons. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:32:36
maybe not for long, may need  to remove bitcoin and just make it a game; as if not enough people play I make a loss.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:51:53
That is awesome! will fix this as soon as the Reddit traffic settles down a bit. Hopefully the server and code will be able to handle the load.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:24:58
I can see is there, please check again.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:59:37
lol you guys are very funny!
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:44:45
Listen everyone, I'm sorry for the rambling. After working so hard I was expecting more support from the community, that is all. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 04:31:13
I do :P
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:49:21
@_date: 2014-03-17 05:16:24
Google can help some times, but not every time. Glad you like the game :)
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:24:56
Please do not upvote, we prefer to run a small beta for now.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:58:33
I don't expect anything free, What I expect is the support of the COMMUNITY that is BITCOIN. Im not saying my site is different or special, I'm saying that we need to support BITCOIN projects instead of talking about prices, lost coins and crap that does not add value to the ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:50:15
You are right, we found an error, will take care of it now. Your payment will be done in a few minutes and I'm adding some free credits to your account. Very sorry for the inconvenience.

done, thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:57:37
found the bug, already working on it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:34:21


I'm not starting my social media campaign, I'm ending it. The project is failing because of trolls like you. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 04:21:24
Thank you for the suggestion, we are changing it.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:50:38
sorry, I did not read the issue you had with your payment address. Could you please put it here so that I can test it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:00:14
Show me the instructions in Flappy Bird. Good games do not need instructions.

No one listens to Keiser after his pump and dump, his credibility went down with the price of his coin.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:23:11
thank you for the feedback, is very appreciated.  We can't make then too easy, as it will become trivial to find the answers on the wikipedia. Still we are trying to improve the phrase quality, while keeping the game fair for everyone. You will get the money you won (0.005btcs) in the address you entered when you created your account, in a few minutes, once the cron job that sends payments gets to work.

Go to the last winner box and you will find links to the Blockchain with the details of each payout. Double check your wallet. Also could you please let me know which username did you use to register.
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:43:06
Look again, I see 3 right now. Out of 24 posts that is &gt;10% devoted to Jokes, while other projects DIE. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:47:26


Your first link is not working.
Second link is not our site IP address, is for filipinopeople.com .
PLEASE stop spreading FUD.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:22:32
typo: Should have written "Losing". :)
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:52:01
It should be pretty self explanatory, however I will try to add some rules so that everything is clear. Thank you for the feedback!
Edit: yes...
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:21:39
I know and I already apologised, is just very disappointing, that is all.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:17:32
would you care to elaborate?
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:20:37
Could you please provide me with a link so that I can look into this.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:30:52
ok, I will fund your account with 0.002 , enough for 2 rounds. If you win, the prize will be sent to the address you entered when the account was created. The funds will become available in max 10 minutes (one confirmation). Dont lose the URL as is the only way to access your account.

@_date: 2014-03-16 21:51:31
Thank you for Beta testing! Is been awesome seen you guys play and give us all this feedback. We are going keep working and improving it. As many of our players we have not get much sleep in many weeks while working on this, I wont stop until every detail is right about it.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:58:14
Thank you for your feedback, we are working on improving the quality of the phrases. Some people actually like the meaningless of some phrases as it adds a bit of dept to the game; still we are tweaking the code to get it just right.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:15:29
only 1 for now.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:43:17
Sorry, English is not my first language.  Any suggestions for a better introductory line?
- Got it, will try to improve the "Payment address" with more details.
- We have some bugs, that is the Beta right there. We should have most of those things fixed in a few days. Thank you for your feedback!
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:48:01
Glad to hear this!
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:24:14
I dont care for the downvotes, everything I said is true. Now go watch some cats.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:35:49
I really like your idea! Do you think we should use the same Phrases we show on the 0.001 version, or will you prefer to have totally different phrases for the "high stakes" ?
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:22:37
ready, the balance will be shown in 10 minutes once we get one confirmation.
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:20:49
Actually YES, in between games when no one submits an answer we show cats.

One of the most important factors for Bitcoin success are the business and services  that accept the  coins. If you kills those projects, you are destroying Bitcoin.

How about some games, where instead of luck, people win by skill. Here is one:
