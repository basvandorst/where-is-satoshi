Judging by the upvotes the post has received, its a popularly held view here

Do you believe that investment groups or governments are going to pour trillions of dollars into Bitcoin in the next two years?

At least about a third of all Bitcoins in existence have been purchased at the current price of $640 or above
I have already taken away 5 million Bitcoins from the calculation (a third) because they may no longer be accessible
Even if you wanted to make it just the Bitcoins that will be generated in the next two years (~2-3 million), then that would still be 20-30% of the figures I conclude with

I have no idea what you're going on about
And if usernames cloud your judgement, that's not my issue

You've got it wrong, I'm talking about total market cap, and the investment needed to cover it
Going by my calculations, each adult person I posit would on average only hold 0.00186 BTC

What's the relevance?
There won't be any significant USD inflation by the end of 2 years time, unless you think financial apocolyptse is about to occur

Divisibility has nothing to do with it

My calculations take into account that 5 million Bitcoins (a third the total) will be kept off the market completely because they may be inaccessible. That's a very generous figure I think.
Anyone remaining who bought at under $640 would still have access to their Bit coins, and if the price per BTC is $640,000 in two years as claimed, then who the hell wouldn't sell? Even if you only bought 0.1BTC, that's $64,000

Not common sense, but the laws of mathematics

Care to say what day in 2010 that 40k BTC transaction was made? Because most days of 2010, total daily transaction volume did not even reach anywhere near 40K
Sounds like another cool story to me, but of course cool stories are no match for real mathematics and demonstrated fact
The OP claims in his title on the front page that Bitcoin will increase 1000x in value from its current price, within the next two years
The current price is $640 so he is positing a price of US$640,000/BTC by 2016
This is all explained in my original post, perhaps you should have read it bro, or otherwise take some lessons in reading comprehension

I agree with you that Bitcoin is a short lived pump-n-dump, but I'm taking it from the perspective most people in here have, that $640,000/BTC would be a fair and long-lasting price

You were around at the time of broadcast.com then I suppose?
Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency, just like broadcast.com isn't the only web domain
And do you really think every adult in the world will spend $1191 on Bitcoin in the next two years?

The total equity of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs combined is less than $300 billion
Were talking not just billions, but *trillions* of investment dollars needed
Its ridiculous, even if you want to suppose that every investment group starts putting 10% of their equity in Bitcoin in the next two years
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:16:42
Bitcoin applications =/= Bitcoin itself
Do you really believe that investment groups are going to pour money into Bitcoin in the *next two years*? Im not talking millions; not even a few billion - but *trillions* of dollars
If anything the bulk of any investment into Bitcoin itself would have to come from people's personal savings

Its a pyramid scheme
