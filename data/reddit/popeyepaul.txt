It is not MtGox's business to determine the value of bitcoin. Just let people use your site without any stupid restrictions, and let the market decide how much one bitcoin is worth.
  
edit: That restriction is there to protect MtGox, not bitcoin. They know that if they allowed people to withdraw all their money, MtGox would be dead. Instead they keep your money hostage so they can keep pretending that there is still money to be traded and people are still using them.

First off, forget about mining. It requires a big investment and probably isn't worth it.
  
You get bitcoins the same way you get anything else in this world, by exchanging it to other money. Do a Google search with your region to find an online exhange. Bitstamp and Kraken are good for Europe but I'm not sure if they serve the US. And watch out for scam sites.

They were fabricating the truth to better serve their agenda (if not outright lying) on their original statement. There is no reason to do so because you have to know that you'll get caught for it.
  
Bitstamp is a good example on how to do it right. Keep it short and present the facts, and the facts only. That's all your customers care about.

They've been saying "soon" forever though. Secondly, they'll do so "at a moderated pace and with new daily/ monthly limits". Meaning that you might still have to wait for a long time to get anything out of there, if that ever happens.

They (probably) aren't waiting for the core developers to fix it, as this bug has been known for a long time and is a non-issue with any technically proficient exchange.

Thank you for sharing. I hate to see the price of bitcoin manipulated so clearly, especially when you know it's the big money taking advantage of trade newbies.

They don't care if the streets are any less safe. A bunch of people have justified their salaries in front of their bosses and more sites popping up means that they'll just have more work to be done (and probably have to ask the government for more funding).

They already said that there will be daily/monthly limits to btc withdrawals. New customers will most likely be put at the end of the line.
  
So even if they are true to their word about allowing withdrawals this Thursday, which I really doubt will happen, you'll still very likely have to wait an unspecified amount of time to get your bitcoins out.
  
As to evidence about MtGox's insolvency, nobody knows except MtGox, but their statements haven't really instilled confidence.

I've told about a dozen of my friends about my investments in Bitcoin, and lately they've probably seen the cool things I've been able to buy with the money I've made (I got into bitcoin when it was less than $100). I'm not rich, but still far wealthier now than any time before.
  
While they've been between neutral and supportive, and if they've had criticisms they've kept it to themselves, but not one of them has asked me a single question about it. These are smart, educated people who earn good money, they've read about bitcoin from the news, but not one of them has asked me a thing about how it works, much less about how they can get in. They could have bought a dozen btc a year ago without it making a dent into their finances.
  
I'm not going to try to convince them otherwise, it's a topic that never comes up, but if bitcoin really takes off (as I am quite certain will happen), I am going to feel really terrible for my friends who have been looking from the sidelines for more than a year now, and not have made any effort to educate themselves about it when I would have been more than happy to talk about my experiences and views. Worse still, I suspect that many of them already resent me for "getting lucky" with bitcoin, when they themselves are too afraid to even try.
  
This is human nature, I guess. People, even the smart ones, are so stuck up with their ways that even the tiniest effort, a small risk outside of their comfort zone is simply too much to bear.

Anybody who knows better, yet still gives their business to MtGox, is a part of the problem. MtGox has been the reason for most of the price crashes in bitcoin history, and they aren't showing any signs of stopping. By doing business with MtGox, you are funding yet another price crash in the near future (and risking your money in the process).
  
You are aware that there are other exchanges out there? With MtGox, you are risking huge amounts of money for small potential gains.

Facebook is a terribly run company that seems to hate its customers and it's a small miracle that they're still in business, so in that sense your analogy to MtGox is spot on.

Anybody who **stores** their bitcoin at an online store/service is a fucking idiot. If you want to buy some weed, you send them the amount that you're going to spend, make your purchase, and if you're left with any bitcoin then you ship it back to your personal wallet.
  
Granted that they might have had that much bitcoin moving from one person to another just at the time of the theft, but if that's the case then at least personal losses should be small. Doesn't make it any more disgusting though.

I am really impressed by the fact that the prices at Bitstamp and other exchanges have remained about even as MtGox's price plunges and their "problems" surmount. This tells us that people have already learned not to give them any attention.
  
Right now it should be obvious to everyone that MtGox is one big scam and speculating about their solvency or status of bitcoin withdrawals is about as useful as speculating if pigs could fly. The money is gone and about the only thing you can do now is prepare for legal action.

Not sure how it is nowadays but just a few months ago when Mt Gox was still, by far, the biggest exchange, there were obvious attempts at short-selling typically every week. No normal person is suddenly going to sell 40,000 bitcoins at a loss, particularly on a weekend when the banks are closed. Sadly, it seemed to be very effective.
  
Best way to counter against this is to educate people. Simply have a look if there is any unusual activity in a market and don't freak out and panic-sell if the price takes a bit of a drop, that's exactly what they want you to do.

They could add a user-defined number at when the program asks for confirmations.

The price had remained surprisingly stable during the summer and I was a bit disappointed to see that it got "stuck". Well, looks like the rollercoaster is back online, better hold on tight.
  
It seems to be up more than $10 dollars in less than 24 hours, starting from a Sunday no less and it could be +- ~$5 at any moment. That's more like it.
  
Also, while we all want to see the price go up quickly, it's important to remember how in April it rocketed at an insane pace (more than +$20 per day), and then quickly fell down. Let's hope it doesn't get quite as crazy this time around.

In addition to the before mentioned point, they might be worried that accepting bitcoin will be seen as some sort of a statement that will hurt regular donations.

We're arguing semantics here but "crash" is a very strong word and it shouldn't be used every time the price goes down a bit, especially as in this case the price bounced back up the next day.
  
As far as I'm concerned the only real crash in the Bitcoin price happened in 2011. We're not doing the community any favors by talking about crashes everywhere, that's not the message you want to send to people curious about Bitcoin.

Moral of the story: cover your ass before you start spending money on ridiculous things such as planes.

Absolutely. I just moved to another country and opened a bank account here, I didn't know we had 2 days of national holidays on top of the weekend so I couldn't access my money for 5 days because the banks wouldn't process my order.
  
Luckily I had just enough cash to get what I needed but that was fucked up.

True, but it's a sign that they're open to Bitcoin and very likely will add it to their other services soon. It's an opposite to Amazon saying "we'll never accept Bitcoin, no matter how much you keep asking us".

I've never done a live trade but I would suggest that you meet up in a cafe or similar place and when you get the money you attempt to buy a cup of coffee or something from the cafe with one of the bills before making the transfer.

To the people who are saying that they're not real friends: Most people would act like this, no matter how solid your friendship has been before. When one person of a group gets rich, and others stay poor, it really screws up the dynamics.
  
You wouldn't tell your friends how much money you have on your bank account. Don't tell them how much money you have in bitcoins other than vague statements like "some" or "enough".

0.2 BTC (roughly $40) donated, cheap price for fantastic software.

Good to hear that. Emerging markets like smaller Eastern European countries could get sizable boosts in their troubled economies by being one of the firsts to support Bitcoin (or at least not hinder it).

People expect bitcoin value to increase greatly in the future. It is therefore smart to keep mining even at a loss, with the expectation that increase in value will make it profitable.

I stopped reading at  Bitcoin is not a US-only invention, a lot of people don't seem to understand that. I wonder if this guy thinks that the Internet is limited to Americans as well.
