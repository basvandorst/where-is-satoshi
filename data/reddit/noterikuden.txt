I like how you're getting the same amount for each coin, make a realism mode were the multiplier changes each time according to the real current Bitcoin price and the starting value lol
@_date: 2018-10-07 13:26:32
That is way more funnier than my post.

It is it looks like Thailand size 19 just greener.
@_date: 2018-10-07 17:15:39

@_date: 2018-10-07 13:39:39
Shit you're right 
@_date: 2018-10-07 15:47:45

@_date: 2018-10-09 13:35:19

@_date: 2018-10-07 13:26:13
Weird... I tried to look it up but it's not in my history! If I find it again I'll reply.

Well, one of my friends works for a car company, and people always react weird when he pulls up with a car from a different car company. Just imagine Elon Musk would drive a Diesel. ( BTW I got something wrong you can actually pay with Bitcoin the shop owner notified me I'm an idiot.)

It was an ad on Reddit, I thought "wow these t-shirts look very specific, they may haven't thought this thing through." And they didn't.
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:15:59
Well funny thing is if you'd go a bit further you'd see that almost every important crypto currency is available and I'm just an idiot.
@_date: 2018-10-07 11:17:49
I'm religious now.
@_date: 2018-10-07 17:39:58
THESE  DAMN. MEMES.
@_date: 2018-10-07 13:26:51
And why is it under the segment "color"? 
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:57:06
Amazing. Segregation again.
@_date: 2018-10-07 15:24:32
U right. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 17:29:35
Yes. I'm an idiot. Sorry for that.
@_date: 2018-10-07 13:19:50
Oh sh*t. I didn't even notice that xD Color: Asian Size xD. Can repost on softwaregore.
@_date: 2018-10-07 17:25:32
Just a grim reminder that I messed up and the store actually accepts Bitcoin... Sorry for that.
@_date: 2018-10-07 15:14:04

@_date: 2019-08-01 17:10:17
Food in 2030 costs much, man
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:21:09
My drug is called the pure euphoria of Bitcoin hitting 11k even though I know I've bought back in 2018 at 20k.
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:16:36
Sounds true.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:28:28
I cannot challenge a program to a fist fight... It would only cost me money..? I'd be the only one who looses in any scenario lol

Shit bruh you right... I'll just fucking crunch the entire computerscreen through my mouth, then I'll compress and decompress that friggn miner until it stops breathing. I'll then store its entire data on the ram and let it be written, read, deleted over and over and over until it stops breathing... I'll give it a simulated mind and only the feeling of pain, then I'll let it being tortured in my simulated world for an eternity over and over again, because time doesn't matter when you're just a program... After 3 eternitys this program shall learn its lesson for making my life so miserable, because it mined without using all the resources... Despicable.
