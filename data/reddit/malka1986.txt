you cannot transmit data using quantum entanglement.
Basically :
* you make 2 electron (e1, e2) interact.
* when you'll be looking at the spin s1 of e1 at any point in the future, the spin s2 of electron e2 will be equal to -s1
And that's it, there is no transmission of information or anything between e1 and e2.

he probably thinks about 'quantum teleportation'. Never saw something THAT badly named. Spoilers : it has NOTHING to do with teleportation.

You can have both.
We could have banking systems built upon bitcoin.
 It is not incompatible at all, think a bank account with BTC instead of USD.
As a matter of fact, a lot of 'online wallet' website are nothing more but banks.
Obviously, you would still be able to use bitcoin the 'good ol' way', same as we use cash.

Defense to blackmail is a valid cause for killing someone imo, but that's just my moral.

They need a 'fancy service' to handle the legal ramifications of using bitcoin. Especially regarding taxes.

atheism is the belief that there is no god.


This is agnosticism.

I do not know a single person that likes its bank. 
At some point, for all people I know, their bank tried to fuck them hard in the ass. Hence, hatred.

Then you are saying it is possible. It is either one or the other.
