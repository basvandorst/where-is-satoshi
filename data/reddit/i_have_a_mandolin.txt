That was your first assertion. It's the opposite of "defending freedom." It's declaring that anything that you think constitutes "screwing" should be illegal. If that's your best effort at defending freedom, please stay far away from the libertarian movement.

There has never been a time of greater certainty in the equity and interest rate markets, and bitcoin is at an all time high. That's the exact opposite of what's supposed to happen if this guy's claim were true.

I absolutely have substance. You do nothing on reddit except talk about crypto currencies, and you rarely talk about the interesting properties of them. You mostly just talk about the price (measured in USD, which I've always found funny about you cargo cult BTC enthusiasts). You don't talk about economics or monetary policy or fundamental properties of money substitutes. You don't talk about advancements in computer science or math or quantum computing. You don't have any interesting non-intellectual pursuits like sports or politics even. Basically, you don't have any interests outside of those consistent with some cookie-cutter philistine day trader. 
So, I insulted you for two very good reasons: you insulted me and you live a life deserving of insult.

Before you ever knew anything about me, you said this:


Now you say this:


It's nice to see you play the "kind and thoughtful soul" personality when you get insulted, but forget it when you're hurling insults at others with no information to base it on. You have some serious self-reflection to do. I at least know I'm an asshole. I don't delude myself into thinking otherwise.

And I won't get all pissy if the people who the US helps fuck over decide to get their revenge, either. I'm not claiming to be a saint. Just that you all definitely aren't, either.

Life is one long series of screwing people and getting screwed. Even by participating in the btc economy, you are just facilitating transactions that are 95% illegal and immoral commerce like human trafficking, terrorism, ransomware and drug cartel violence. For every shoe or pizza that gets purchased with btc, a child rape gets purchased, too.
So, get off your fucking high horse. You're just mad because you thought you could make a quick buck by passively supporting the black market, and the US cracked down on you.

I just read through your history of reddit posts. You don't have any ideology at all. You're a simple-minded fool who was lucky enough to have a friend tell him about cryptocurrencies, and you have molded a fake set of beliefs around the monetary gains you've made in btc.
In addition to you lack of any true ideology, you have no understanding of the role or definition of money, and you are a pretentous and arrogant twat for thinking (a) that I am beneath you, and (b) that I am somehow new to whatever perceived "community" you think you're a part of (I paid $0.25 for my first bitcoin). So, go ahead and "feel sorry" for me if it pleases you.

Everything that the country with superior military might to the rest of the world combined does is legal. You may not like it, but if some shitbag of a country wants to allow some rats to fuck with American commerce, the US can stop it however it pleases.
