Your online wallet or exchange might though. Not sure how this is relevant to Bitcoin.

You have to remember that for all you know, the value could've plummeted and you would've lost money. I'm guessing your ROI was something like 200%, which is very good.

Right, I suppose they could've put a message up on their website saying that their customers should expect delays in certain departments... I thought that went without saying.   
But then again, they did [write on their blog]( that they were working on scaling their platform and support team.

If I were you, I'd sell your bitcoin and go back to school.

I mean, you could just buy bitcoins with your wage ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

And how in the world could they have prepared for this? They couldn't have known that they were going to get such a crazy amount of users in such a short period of time.

No, believe me. It will. 100%. /s

I didn't say it was a stock?

Thank you

And for all you know it could've dropped to $100. I'd call your dad wise for not buying. Unlucky, but wise.

Maybe for you they have, but I guarantee that they're all working their asses off to keep up with everything. It's not because they have answered your support ticket yet that they're not actually doing anything.

Not everything you buy in life has to be an investment, lol.

Good analogy. Never thought of it like that. You've changed my opinion.

Who says it's devalued?
