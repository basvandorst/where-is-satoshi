I think nobody has any illusions that the price will be stable any time soon. It will be volatile for a while and that means the price will drop as well as rise. So far, ever since bitcoin started, the general trend is upward.

I've been 'into' bitcoin for a year and it was quite the exciting year. Not just the rollercoaster price ride, but also everything around it. 
Seeing it becoming more and more mainstream, being able to actually purchase things with it (gotta love home delivered food paid for with bitcoin), the mining race, the controversy, the different 'camps'. Seems like there is so much going on and I don't see it end anytime soon. 
Yes, I am excited for the future too!

Bitcoin is not centralised and exchanges are just places where bitcoins are bought/sold. So basically anyone can start their own exchange, it's nothing more than a place to trade them.
About mining difficulty in short: it gets adjusted every 2016 blocks, based on the average time it took to find those 2016 blocks. It will get adjusted to an expected 600 seconds per block, or a total of 2 weeks for the 2016 blocks. If more hashing power enters the network, blocks will be found faster and thus the adjustment will be such that the difficulty goes up. So also, if it takes longer than 2 weeks to find 2016 blocks the difficulty will go down.

Only $1 million?
You are being very conservative, I'd say it will easily take a market cap of 10% so the value is $10 million. Or maybe even 50% so it will be $50 million. Wait, I am sure it will conquer the whole market. 
People, better hold on. We are looking at a $100 million bitcoin!

I think a few altcoins will survive alongside bitcoin, but they would have to bring something that makes them useful or they will eventually fail. 
It might even be good for bitcoin if there are a few altcoins alongside it, but I don't think 100's of altcoins would be good. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:00:36
Your point of view is one that labels bitcoin purely as a commodity. Eventually bitcoin should become more of a currency instead of commodity, but as long as it is this volatile it won't fully be.
Lots of people are not into bitcoin as a scheme to get rich quick, but as a means to get rid of banks, to get a new kind of currency to replace the old fiat that is way overdue to be disbanded for something cheaper, faster and personal.

They get their value mostly from speculation. Some coins have an acrive dev team/community, so they might get valued more. Some coins have 1 million coins released, others 500 million. Scarcity also has influence on the value.
Then there is also hype. One of the most hyped altcoins now is Quark and it's getting huge trading volumes. 
There are just a few altcoins that are taken serious, because they have something that makes them usefull. Litecoin and Namecoin for example.

Yes I agree, much tweeking is needed and bitcoin needs to overcome many bumps before it has a realistic chance of becoming mainstream. Number 2 is my biggest concern. Bitcoin needs to be send and accepted immediately without any waiting time or it won't have a chance. While I am sure the future of money changes and that decentralised currency has a big future, it needs to be a system that works real time without any delay.
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:12:57
So many facepalms in this post. 
First off, forget about BFL, they are scammers and never delivered on time. 
Second, a bitcoin is not worth 560$ in your area. They are globally priced and are worth around 380$ atm.
Thirdly, nobody will buy your USB miner for 250$.
Don't wanna be mean to you and I understand that bitcoin can be a bit difficulty to get your head around, but you are assuming things here that are completely false. 
Keep testing stuff, that's cool to do. Don't spend a lot of money on an ASIC miner before you know what it is, what they can do, what they are worth, what companies you can trust etc. etc.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:00:02
I still don't see how that works. A few weeks ago the price of BTC was about 10x lower and I am pretty sure there weren't 10x less adresses back then. It is a very arbitrary moment in time and not correlated to the ratio of adresses vs. bitcoin price at any other point.

In Dutch it would be 'bitmunt', but everyone uses bitcoin. We usually adopt those kind of English terms.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:54:06
I'm Dutch and a lifetime client of Rabobank.
They don't block payments related to bitcoin. They do have an 'ethical commision' that gave a negative advise concerning bitcoins. This advise is not binding and all branches of Rabobank can decide themselves what to do with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:14:06
In Dutch we use quite some English terms, especially for computer-related terms. Some translations are different, depending on context, but here is a translation that should work:
1. Publiek adres
2. Storting / verificatie
3. Privé sleutel / (depends on context)
4. Invoerformaat portemonnee (the English wallet can be used as well)
5. Papieren portemonnee (or wallet)
6. Om meer geld naar deze papieren portemonnee over te maken kun je altijd bitcoins naar het publieke adres sturen.
7. Verifieer je saldo door het publieke adress op te zoeken met een service zoals blockchain.info.
8. LAAT JE PRIVÉ SLEUTEL NIET ZIEN totdat je het saldo van deze portemonnee over wilt maken naar een bitcoin client, exchange of online portemonnee.
9. Als je het saldo van deze portemonnee uit wilt laten betalen, dan kun je het beste het HELE BEDRAG opnemen. Als je probeert een beetje op te nemen ben je waarschijnlijk de overige bitcoins kwijt.
10. Vragen? Ga naar bitcoinpaperwallet.com
11. Bedrag toegevoegd
12. Notities
13. Datum

Just read the forums and you see that many people like bitcoins for more than just a get-rich-quick scheme.
About sales with bitcoins, I don't know the exact numbers, but you mention one example. I can name examples where bitcoin is actually succesful as a means of payment. For example, look at thuisbezorgd.nl, a Dutch home delivery company for food. They say that their bitcoin sales outperforms iDeal sales when they first started using it.
 I won't argue that there are people who hold their coins instead of spending them hoping the price rises 'to the moon'. What I do believe is that we are in the very early stages of something that could change money as we know it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:37:19

I do like your idea of a local cryptocurrency, but I think it is real hard to get something like that off the ground and as riplin pointed out there are real dangers you have to consider as well.

In 250 days the difficulty will most likely be a lot higher than 2 billion. You will never earn your money back. 
You might mine solo and be lucky and find a block yourself, but chances of that are nearly 0%. You don't need to 'finish' a block, you need to 'find' it. If you mine in a pool you will get a percentage of the mined bitcoins. Seeing that the big pools have many TH/s of hashing power, your 2.2 GH/s miner will give you very little. At the current difficulty you can expect about 0.002 BTC per day.
How to get in a pool? Just look for one, there are plenty of pools you can join. Here is a list of them: 
Enjoy mining, but don't expect too much!

Look on your right, there's a section called 'Getting Started' and 'FAQ'.

Awesome, thanks!

I'm pretty sure they haven't, as they plan to speak together about Quark on 19 december.

My apologies if you want to use it for a noble cause. Why not just use bitcoin?
By the sound of it you might be better off with a physical kind of currency.
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:26:05
Cool story! 
All around me I notice that more and more people heard about bitcoin and that quite some people are genuinely interested in the mechanics. And that's in some small town in the Netherlands. :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:20:03
You aren't the first and you won't be the last. Problem with gambling is that you keep wanting more and more and never take your winnings. Until it is too late.
Sorry for your loss.

I think that is "a little short through the corner", to use another Dutch saying.  While it is true that lots of time we "watch the cat out of the tree", I find that also here in the Netherlands bitcoin is generating a lot of interest.

A friend of mine called Butterfly Labs just yesterday and they said if you order now your order would most likely not arrive before october. And by then the mining difficulty might be so high that your 5 GH/S miner is basically worthless. 
So in my opinion it's not a good idea.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:25:13
Not downvoting anyone, but this is the bitcoin subreddit. There are plenty of other places to talk about cryptocoins, altcoins and specific coins.

Got it now, I misread it as getting a random amount. *needs another coffee*

The site I used most is bitonic.nl. You can pay with iDeal there.
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:25:38
Only company I ever got something from is KnC and I can recommend them. They delivered on time and got more GH/s than promised. Nearly earned the investment back now.
Generally, pre-ordering a miner is not recommended.
You can easily hook it up in your home, no need to put it in a different location. Sounds a bit scammy to me.

Business owner here: I take bitcoin serious and don't let my judgement be influenced by memes and jokes.
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:51:32
Indeed, I worded it a bit clumsy. Maybe the value of bitcoin stabilises, but it sure does not necessarily collapse as would a pyramid scheme. It could mean mass adoption and being used almost everywhere and thus succesful enough to stay.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:48:43
What if the price drops to $500 tomorrow. Does that mean that the price per bitcoin would be $350,000?
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:48:48
I wouldn't put my money on BFL, they have a backlog of 50k orders and only delivering very slowly. Nobody can tell you for sure if it will work down the line, since nobody can predict the future of bitcoin. Most likely it won't be worth it though, you are better off just buying BTC instead sinking money on a miner you might never get. GPU mining can be done still, but only with good AMD GPU's basically. Here is a link to the GPU's and their corresponding hash rates:

That's much too confusing. Plus I doubt "bit dollar" will ever catch on.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:54:51
I usually refer to 1/1000th of a Bitcoin as 'bitmil' or BTM.

Is it possible to meet in person and see your factory?

I grew up alongside personal computers as well. Coming from a small town in the Netherlands, we were some of the first in the mid 80's who owned a home computer (a Tulip 286 with a whopping 10 mb harddisk, 640Kb RAM and running at an amazing 10 MHz). And being a kid, I knew everyone in town who owned a computer for reasons no other than copying the latest games (think Paratrooper and Alley Cat). 
My dad was a bit of a visionary back then, he believed that home computers would be a big part of the future and that most people would own one. Most people laughed at that and didn't see the purpose of computers. It would never catch on they said, maybe just for businesses. 
The funny thing is, similar things my dad heard back then about computers, I hear now when it comes to bitcoin. And the irony of it all is, my dad doesn't believe in bitcoin. 
Can't blame him I guess, having worked at a bank for 40 years and being retired now he has different things to occupy him with....

I preordered a Knc Neptune. Not worried about the price drop one bit. I expect many miners to point their rigs at other coins, so the difficulty of BTC might rise slower than when BTC is sky high. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:19:08
The value has also risen $150 in a week.

Don't download a wallet that has coins in it. That's not the normal way to buy bitcoins.
Download your own wallet and have the coins send there to your address.

Most likely very soon GPU mining won't be profitable, since new FPGA and ASIC miners will flood the market soon and mining difficulty will go up. And only a few GPU's are profitable now, with most of them you shouldn't bother. There are a few other options besides BFL, but usually there are large pre- or backorders since many people want in. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:39:22
Max Keiser tweeted about it and I suppose many people jumped on the bandwagon to try and make some money off it.

I don't know what pubs you go to, but the ones I go to always have several kinds of beer you can order.

Usually people have to find out for themselves before they learn. If ever. Luckily it only cost you a very small amount of money.

I would have loved it as a kid to get magic internet money and see what it is, what it can do and what it's worth.

You could easily take some other points in that chart and make it go up to 100K!

I'm not mining with KnC, but I got a miner from them. It was a gamble and it paid off, basically because BTC is at a record high I can pay off my miner and freeroll from now on. Just need a day of mining or so to get my investment back. It is risky though, because there are plenty of shady companies out there and by far not all of them deliver on time.
You basically need a network cable and a power supply unit. It's not complicated at all to plug it in and get it to work. There are no wires involved that cost a lot of money, just a basic network cable which costs a few Euros here.

I see you changed it now. tl;dr is meant to summorize in a few words or a sentence what you said before. Most people won't read such a big wall of text.

I would be interested in the viewpoint of Chinese investors. Also if/when they plan to invest in altcoins and which ones they would go to (seems LTC is popular, but other altcoins too?)

BS. No begging allowed.

He/she is being serious. 5 GH/s would give you about 0.005 BTC per day at current difficulty. And this is getting less and less over time when difficulty increases.

There are already 100's of new 'bitcoins'.

In 4 years, that might be a small fortune as well.
