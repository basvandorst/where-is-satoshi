Guess that's what I will be doing then, appreciate the input and I think you are correct about crossing a threshold. I just won't keep that much money as BTC anymore I guess.

Arizona, never had an issue with it before. I used to sell my BTC on localbitcoins.com but I am so sketched out by people getting in trouble for money transmitting.

When I asked what governmental regulation it is they need my information for they replied, "Unfortunately, the purpose of this email is not to discuss various government regulations. It’s purpose is to request and collect information from Coinbase’s customers."

I know right! Yeah it's copy pasted, I couldn't believe it. I have clients and would never use attitude like that with them. Total douchery.

It's just a personal account but I have accepted BTC payments to it, not sure if switching to a merchant account would help or hurt things as I really just don't want to deal with extra invoices for everything.

Coinbase wallet straight to localbitcoins wallet, would that be an issue? 
Thanks for the input btw.

That is such a scummy way to "fix" their mistake.

While you are here, my Coinbase closed my account and is not responding to support tickets that I have submitted multiple times requesting ANY information as to WHY my account was closed. 
All I got was an email TELLING me I had violated the ToS (Which I haven't, at all since I have only ever traded between personally owned wallets) and ignoring all my requests for more information as to how exactly my account was in violation.
