Just got an email from reddit asking for some more details
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:13:22
Thanks, it says 1 conformation now. I will be patient 
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:39:12
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:54:39
It has just gone through :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:17:02
It is on 4 conformations but the comment has not been gilded :/ Any idea who to contact from reddit about this?
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:50:03
I sent an email to the reddit team who deal with gold, i am sure it will work out in the end :) i will update this once it has been sorted. thanks for the help

Because if you wait a few more years they aren't for sale or the price doesn't decrease any more. Using computers was a terrible example to try and prove your point.

Never the latest model. Why would I when there are perfectly good models for my need which are less than half the price. I'm using a Samsung galaxy s5 which I bought a couple of years ago when there had been two newer models.

They own an exchange. It being three years old doesn't change anything. It just shows why people aren't interested in using Bitcoin as a currency 
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:04:41
With inflation if you don't spend flat you can buy less with it down the road as it's value in real terms falls. Some economists think that the great depression is an example of a deflationary spiral.
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:43:16
I don't think this is new.
Take the Winklevoss twins. They are two of th erichest people in the world in terms of bitcoin but they don't spend it because they think they would be overpaying down the road.
From their AMA: 




If these guys don't want to use it as a currency then I expect it is the same for many others. A deflationary currency will always have problems regarding spending.

wait another week it is

?? I don't plan on using bitcoin as an investment. I plan on using it as a currency. When the price is stable i can buy some and use them as a currency. I may not make money, but the purpose of bitcoin is not meant to be to make money from it. I am indifferent if the price rises or stays the same, i just want to see it stable (which as the price gets higher, the more stable it gets as the fluctuations are a smaller percentage of its value)
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:28:53
personally i would use bitbargain, although there is no way of seeing how fast people sell there
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:36:03
not sure why you were downvoted, i thought it was a good reply
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:52:23
I think the price of bitcoin will continue to rise quickly above 300 usd per coin, i also think there will be a small crash, maybe dropping 40usd in the next week or so. By the end of the month i expect the price to be at 400 -500 usd. The faster the price rises though the more unstable the growth as more get rich fast people start investing. 
I do really dislike the bitcoin subreddit getting clogged with posts about going to the moon though...
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:14:11
Sorry for your loss. I don't really understand how people expect to day trade with bitcoins. When you day trade in stocks, you can instantly buy stocks with relative ease and sell them. With bitcoin there is often a delay and you may not always be able to sell or buy the bitcoins. IMO bitcoins are a much longer investment
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:36:47
it will do you good :) stay off the internet and relax, the question is, what price do you expect when you return?
i'm calling 320 usd
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:07:09
I don't think bitcoin will replace fiat, but instead it will accompany it. I do think it can overtake dollars for online transactions though. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:19:24
I completely agree with your first two statements. I disagree about deflation helping the poor and inflation hurting them. if you have savings, inflation hurts you, if you have debt, inflation helps you. The poor are more likely to have debt than the rich. 
This is assuming you are talking about inflation as the general increase in prices? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:39:44
you pay interest on debt but when inflation &gt; interest, the amount of real debt you hold decreases 
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:02:33
i will flip a coin for you... heads buy, tails wait another week:
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:21:48
This isn't the case. The guardian writes about bitcoin positively, albeit not often.
Yesterday the financial times in the UK wrote positively about bitcoin and the possibility of ebay adopting it
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:11:59
£10 a week reduces the effect of volatility. Probably best to use bitbargain.co.uk or localbitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:18:49
Yes but if you read the article it is actually quite interesting. 






@_date: 2013-11-05 23:31:01
I guess you could say they 
( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■
chased you away.
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:15:40
If you have debt then you are gaining with inflation. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:58:07
tbh i cant imagine burma adopting bitcoin or the authorities being pleased with you advertising it. if there really isnt much internet access there then it may also be a bit useless. enjoy your holiday / work and try not to think about bitcoin... assuming you are a long term holder.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:09:24
True, but i have more faith in fiat than most on this subreddit, and i prefer the liquidity of fiat to bitcoin at the moment, but who is to say how long this will last
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:55:53
I agree with the idea, it is nice and it is generally the safest way to invest. Most people have minimum buy amounts though of maybe 20+ dollars worth, so it cant be satoshi stacking, but for fractions of a bitcoin i think it is a great idea.
I do think we are now at the point where mtb should be the norm, and using bitcoin as an exchange is possibly even counter productive. People are reluctant to buy a fraction of a bitcoin, where as they would be happy to buy mtbs if that was the standard denomination. I also think it would be easier for a dollar comparason than using btc / dollar. 
I like the idea though :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:56:13
Faster mining / cheaper mining in answer to the title.
I don't think the cost of mining dropping would have a significant effect on the value of bitcoin. If mining was more profitable, more people would do it, making it harder to mine. A lot of people use their rigs to mine other coins which are more profitable, so there is the spare mining capacity too. As btc value increases people will mine more if they can make more profit.
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:01:50
all the media attention last week meant that many eople signed up to various sites to buy bit coins. it takes a few days to get verified and this week people started being able to buy bitcoins. last week many predicted a big rise this week, which in itself helps the price rise. 
then there are the other factors like bitcoin is becoming more recognised, ebay may start accepting them (was in the ft yesterday)and a few other larger companies may also accept them. bitcoin as a legit currency is becoming less scary to most people
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:43:46
Yep this is true, well put, although i think a lot comes down to different economic schools of thought though. 
Back on topic though, i think OP is correct that if the price keeps rising at this speed bitcoin may end up at a money store rather than a currency, but whatever happens, i do think bitcoin will become a globally used currency (it is pretty global even now). 
It is more convenient than gold, the pro for gold is that it is physical so you can see it. This also works against gold though, it is too difficult to transport in large amounts. When banks trade gold, they can easily lie to each other, making the pro of physicality for gold disappear. Bitcoin, once widely adopted and accepted may well overtake gold as a money store, and be a major contender to fiat. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:23:34
buy, mining is barely profitable and you would need to spend over 1500 usd to buy one worth while
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:15:34
I thought it was fixed at 7, maybe 8 decimal places. Can someone confirm that miners can change this?
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:16:31
:) to be honest i think you should use 1/10 of what you planned on investing, spend that today and the same amount every day for the next 10 days. (So long as it isn't life savings etc) good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:26:45
ah ok thanks, i am in the UK and from what i understand, local bitcoin and bitbargain are the 2 easiest ways to get coins. There is no possibility of day trading using them for me, but i am sure i could get usd and use the bigger exchanges
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:10:36
nope, if he wanted / needed the money, that is fine. i think he kept some anyway and some of the media was misleading. i think the appartment was only maybe 140k not 840k. in any case, some people may prefer to have a certain amount in the present than having more in the future. 
we can look back to the pizza that cost a million dollars. the guy has commented since saying that he does not regret it because without spending however many bit coins on a pizza,  bit coins may not have taken of. each to their own
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:05:59
media? last week there was an article in the guardian and on many other sites about a guy who bought 27 usd in bitcoins and forgot about them, he then found them and sold them for 840000 usd and bought a house in norway.
although i think a lot of the articles were wrong as he only sold some and the house was maybe 140000 usd or something... but the media is one of the main factors
