No, stop doubling down on the whataboutism, answer the original question about alex jones getting people to harass mourning parents.

How is that different?

Going back to the roads example. Should you pay for, say, the help of firefighters? Should you pay for their gear, their road tolls, their water? Modern society has to be collaborative, and the only way to fund certain very necessary things is THROUGH taxes, unless you have a better solution?

You totally can collaborate with people. But as the thing you're collaborating on gets more complex and important (in the "people's lives depend on this" kind of way) it becomes infeasible to realistically expect people to come together and properly implement. And if they DO come together and do so, that's a nascent government anyway. Or a corporation, I suppose. I would LOVE people to do the right thing for their fellows, but it just doesnt happen on a large enough scale to be effective. I just cant say I trust people that much.
I support bitcoin entirely because I hope it will allow for more efficient, less wasteful, and MORE ACCOUNTABLE funding and taxes. I want it to free us from competing national currencies and help align the interests of more people around the world.

I totally agree with you there. I wish we would put tax money to healthcare. 
My point isnt that taxes are perfectly and justly allocated, far from it. I'm arguing that improving the efficiency and transparency of our taxes (possibly through the public ledger) is a better solution that just stopping paying for these things altogether.
