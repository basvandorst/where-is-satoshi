AA talking about this point specifically. 5 minute watch.

The story of satoshi is pretty incredible. Random anon comes along claiming to have solved a cryptographic problem of decentralized networks that has plagued the community for decades. No one believes in it at first except Hal. He stays around just long enough that the community can stand on it's own feet. First whiff of the CIA and he just vanishes. Just a few short years later the project has grown beyond the ability of most governments to stop. It is a wild hydra that is beyond the control of the most powerful organizations on earth. This is the stuff of science fiction. Wow!

Doubt it. There is no evidence of that at all, everything points to it being a single person.

We can't even get bfx to prove they have 100% reserve with tether. I get gov being slow to regulate, their  goal is protecting investors, everything else is second to that. The difference between those regulators and the commenters on reddit is the regulators don't pretend to understand the technology, the econimics, and the social implciations of btc. 
This also begs the question. Why the fuck do you NEED government approval. Bitcoin is designed to be independent of centralized power structures, so why is there so much god damn whining about the power structures not recognizing bitcoin. IMO the obivous answer is that ya'll don't care about the tech you only care about more buyers coming in so your coins are worth more. 
If anything I think regulators have been very reasonable so far with a hands off approach. Wait and see where the tech goes. Especially impressive is you haven't seen the US gov flip flop between banning it or not like china and SK.
All in all. Things are okay. Ya'll just a bunch of whiny babies who want more ponzi for the ponzi pyramid rather than caring truly about the tech.
I also believe this a red herring when you have companies like factom inc building scale-able, smart systems based on conservative interpretations of existing legal frameworks.

It's hyperbolic but 90% of my peers have 20k or more in student debt. I know a couple families that are 6 figures into student debt and they are trying to start families on top of that.

What is the best lightning wallet to use? Google searching turns up a dozen variations on the search term and i can't help but feel some of those are phishing attempts.

This is pretty cool, I wish chase would show similar support.

Can we create a bitbutt subreddit to make fun of the stupid inaccuracies those guys get away with way too often?
It'd be so meta too.

That's a pretty shitty short sighted attitude. Buy a little here and there and hold long. If your wanting to trade alt coins would prob be better for that.

Interest rates need to raise but I doubt he would force Yellen to do thay, especially since he comes in Jan or later and it has been talked about a rate increase coming before years end.

Good lord fuck. I bought btc, moved to eth, moved to xmr, all this almost a year ago. This is going to be a huge pain in the ass to figure out.
Which also means I likely didn't report to the IRS last tax filing...
Any suggestions on how I should go about correcting this mess?

What new folks? The price is dropping because everyone is selling out.
This shit post re post was a little premature, best saved for the wild dips during ferocious bull runs.

Are you talking about how cringy this post is? Every time i think about coming back i see this shit and loudly rage at the general stupidity before quietly leaving again.

Any resources that you might suggest? Probably going to talk to an accountant tomorrow. See what he thinks. But i may have to find someone a little more specialized to deal with this.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:25:02
he likely meant 5% annually, paid out quarterly.

I've made and lost the kind of money that you dream of and i still have more bitcoin than you do.

Already up another 8btc 5 hours later.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:06:51
obviously we are talking stock market here. Where are you getting 20% returns? AFAIK that does not exist, never has never will. Maybe you get lucky for a quarter but no way that is gonna be consistent. Some of the best dividends in the world pay only 3% per annum.

Imagine her perspective. You're making 2.15 an hour and you need tips to survive, this weird man comes in and hands you a piece of paper telling you it will be worth 20x in just six months, you don't understand what he is saying and you feel like he is trying to scam you. He tries to explain this weird new concept to you but it's pretty difficult to understand and as his explanation falls on deaf ears he becomes aggravated and starts shouting about everyone going to the moon. You think this fucker is crazy so you call the owners over and they have never heard of bitcoin either and as the patron refuses to pay with cash you have no choice but to ban him and kick him out.
Sorry op but you brought this up on yourself. I commend you for trying to introduce these concepts to other people but you should not have any problems understanding why you got the reaction you did.

There is income tax on mining and capital gains tax on trading. No sales tax.

Funny enough, you see this shit all the time in the league of legends subreddit. Someone containing about being banned, they have a well written sob story and the crowd is giving condolences until an employee comes around and posts proof of why they were rightly banned and makes a fool of them in process. It happens almost every time someone makes a post like that. I am a lot more cautious in believing people who cry foul these days.

Any thoughts on why they might think it is fraud?

200 nodes was hyperbole but this scenario as envisioned by satoshi saw larger orgs charitably or self-servingly running nodes as the chain size outgrew most home consumer capabilities to run. 
Obviously the direction of bitcoin has taken a huge turn since then but it doesnt change the fact that by offloading tx onto side/2nd layer chains there will eventually be a point in the future of btc where it is no profitable or correctly incentivized to run a miner. At the very least this is a 100 years or w/e into the future when the last block reward drops. In practice we could see this hit much sooner.
This is also the same arguement monero used to justify an infinite tail emission.

This is a long term issue that I haven't heard a good answer to. The idea is that corps and govs will maintain the network as they would any infrastructure. This leaves a ton of assumptions.
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:08:21
Pretty sure it was satoshi who said that on bitcoin talk. as the chain grows it will necessitate community effort to sustain it, wether that is starbucks running 200 different nodes throughout the US to sustain tx certainty, companies like google running nodes on their back end pro bono, or potentially the US gov and other nations running nodes as organic growth grew to such strengths that it was demanded.

Why did you have so much on the exchange at once? Did you make killer trades or something?
