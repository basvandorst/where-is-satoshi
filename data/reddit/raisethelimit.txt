He currently has admin control over it.  I believe Satoshi created the forum, however.

My apologies to those who have already seen this.  It ended up censored each time yesterday, so I thought I would try again this morning.

@_date: 2015-08-13 03:23:34
Yes, but it doesn't seem to be 100% of the time.  I thought it was XT too.  I just did another test post that didn't get modded, after 3 posts and several comments that did.  
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:56:41
I'm not sure now.  Several posts with the same content were censored.  And then I made several test post and comments with random links to the sub-reddit that shall not be mentioned, and they were all auto-censored.  Then I talked about the censoring here.  And then it seemed to stop and the following test posts went through.  So I'm not sure exactly what is going on.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:57:24
Thanks, unfortunately it looks like it's already been censored.
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:02:25
OK it seems any link to the sub-reddits that shall not be named get automatically hidden, whether it's in a submission or in a comment.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:26:10
We have been speaking up.  Problem is that it keeps being censored.  
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:57:33
Many of my comments are being censored too.  Let's do a test...
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:16:09
And they keep removing my new comic:
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:33:34
1-conf is already dead, so I support this.  It is TOTALLY UNSECURE already.  People need to realize that there are only some things Bitcoin is good for. Fast transactions aren't one of them (0-conf). Neither are slow transactions (1-conf).  
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:26:34
I can confirm.  It was here, then it was removed, and then it came back.
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:25:44
Half of the Ministry's mandate is decentralization!!  
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:58:18
is manipulating the debate by censoring posts [will this get auto-moded?]
Seemed to work.  Let's try mentioning the sub that shall not be named next...

Are you questioning the Committee's wisdom?
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:16:51
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:26:41
This is actually quite brilliant.  Let's extend it by making _all_ transactions super insecure, so that we stop using them altogether. My mom told me that it's better to be safe than sorry, and no level of confirmations makes things perfectly secure. 
As an added benefit, if we get rid of transactions completely, it will keep the blockchain very compact in size, making bitcoin SUPER decentralized.  I might be able to write assembler code and run it on my TI-81 calculator from high school over a string stretched between two empty cans of Cambell's Soup.
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:32:49
I didn't.  In fact I can still see it.  However, when I log out it says [removed].
This is very interesting.  When I first submitted the post it was heavily upvoted similar to my other satires. However, after about the 1 hr mark, it seemed to come under down vote attack falling from over 85% upvoted to  less than 65%.  Then I fell asleep.  I just woke up and see that it's been removed.

That's why I responded individually to each commenter.  At least they'll see that a post of theirs has been replied to, and might come here to take a look.  
Any other ideas?

Here's a screenshot.  Obviously, I *could* have faked it:
@_date: 2015-07-08 11:03:28
I don't know.  Hopefully we can get more eyes over here and figure this out.  
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:46:29
Could it have been deleted under the ground of being fake news (from the future LOL)?

I don't know.  Anyways, I need to check out for a bit.  Thanks for the help in trying to resolve this mystery.  I'll check back later...

It's been removed from r/Bitcoin entirely.  Which sucks because now no one is going to see this evidence of censorship.

Can you find the post anywhere though if you search the first several pages, controversial, etc?  I can't, however it was very recently on the first page.  I've never heard of an upvoted or controversial post disappearing after only 8 hours.  
We need more people to see this thread!!

OK I just PM'd ThePiachu.  I'll post his response if I get one.

u/raisethelimit satires (first to last)
1. Blocking the stream (284 upvotes)
2. Replace-by-fee (114 upvotes)
3. Federal Reserve Press Release parody   (25 upvotes + deletion)
These posts were all highly upvoted initially, and I expected them to make it to the top or second post.  However, the last two, and the last especially, came under heavy down vote attack falling from 85%+ upvoted into the 60s.  
My hunch is that someone or some group is coordinating a downvote brigade for such content.  
That still doesn't explain why this last post was deleted.

OK well I'm asking you to also stop participating in this subreddit.  
@_date: 2015-10-05 08:00:49
Can you please describe how he was vote brigading? Are you referring to how he shared his submission at other subreddits and forums?
@_date: 2015-10-05 06:20:32
If you want to talk to you should reply in the [redacted] subreddit or at bitco.in.  
This submission has now been censored and has beem banned from this subreddit.  
@_date: 2015-10-05 07:44:48


WTF??  Didn't you just censor this submission and ban @_date: 2015-10-05 08:43:57
By the way, I was just being facetious to illustrate the ridiculousness of never posting again in a subreddit because some random told you not to.  I'd like to post in both and /r/bitcoin.
