I looked Wall Street on google street view once. Someone ask me about my Crypto price predictions for 2018.

Hey I’m holding some Litecoin and I disagree. ��

The 2 button at the same time pressing aside, the ledger nano s appears to be better equipped as a hardware wallet. 
“There have been a number of successful attempt to use just the DFU to remotely dump the memory of the STM32F family of microcontrollers. So what does this mean? For the Trezor, it is a big deal because it would potentially allow a hacker to pull private keys from the device remotely. For the Ledger it is less of a problem because the private keys are not stored on the STM32 but rather the ST31 secure enclave. Therefore, even if the memory of the STM32 is copied remotely, the private keys would still be safe on the ST31.”

Anyone falling for this should not be investing in Crypto as it would demonstrate they clearly do not understand the technology.

Hey fellow EU citizen. I can confirm that trading using EUR pairings works fine on GDAX.

This guy raises some interesting points about hardware wallets. He compares the trezor and ledger. 
The take home message for me was that the Ledger nano s is actually more secure than the Trezor. The ledger nano s was also cheaper for me too which sealed the deal.

You’d have to be first to submit the proof of work for the mined block containing your transaction and you are competing with the rest of the network in doing this. I just wouldn’t happen.

There are alternatives to moving Btc to other exchanges for trading alts though. You can buy some LTC or eth for example if you’re using Coinbase/GDAX and send that through and convert it at the other end for Btc. The Binance exchange have alt pairings with ETH so if you send ether you wouldn’t even need to change it up when it gets there. 
Moving small amounts of Btc around at the moment is not desirable as we all know because of the delay and cost.

Forget Coinbase and go to GDAX.com. It’s the same company (you even use the same login details) but GDAX is the more ‘advanced’ version. You can or limit buys in which incur zero transaction fees. I think even the market buys have cheaper fees.

Do you have your coins in a wallet “offline” in a paper or hardware wallet or is it sitting  at the exchange with a stop loss on it set at $24.999?
