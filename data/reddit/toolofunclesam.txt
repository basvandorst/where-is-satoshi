So now all the haters (myself included) can quit mocking internet money, I just got paid 73 cents, for enjoying bitcoin! Man I love the internet.

ah cool, thanks! I'll go spread the bitcoin word in the lounge.

It's crazy, the generosity of a few are pushing a brand new currency to levels that were only talked about.
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:51:21
Is this still offered?  I'm always just too late.
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:10:18
The reason why that is the suggested fee is because that is what the basic miner's fee was when the app was first made.  The only way you can transfer with zero fees is if there is a miner willing to accept it, which there isn't currently.

Thanks, guy. my enthusiasm definitely just re-waned :D. btw, you're awesome!

I tried it on another redditor and it worked, so I guess they have a minimum limit of .01

well when you want to put big money into a new market, it would seem smart to try and crash the price momentarily. I'm just guessing here.

This is a really good idea. I've been playing with making Escrow sites, even got so far as to make one for gaming, but never did anything beyond the mock up. By far the easiest transaction i've made with bitcoin was buying Starcraft 2 from my cousin. I trusted the seller, he trusted the buyer, things went smooth and easy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:59:01
I was checking some of the larger transactions on the blockchain, and I noticed that more than half were originating in the UK. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 11:02:36
waaat, you just literally gave me a +1 Internets? That. Is. Awesome. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:48:40
You're welcome. That's how I made my first purchase.  My buddy wanted bitcoin, and I wanted starcraft, so I paid him in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:55:56
Improve on localbitcoins somehow.  Maybe introduce a mandatory escrow?
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:28:08
see the comments to those other guys.  I'm not the gambling sort, I just wanted to test how well my phone wallet would handle multiple transactions. there was some lag for them coming in but it was amazingly smooth.
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:26:53
Well you see married men need to do what needs to be done in order to get their video games.  So unbeknownst to my wife, I stashed some cash in bitcoin, watched it grow, decided Starcraft was more important, and then simply contacted a guy I know and said "hey guy, you want some bitcoin? Here's my blizzard login, send me a copy of HotS." An entirely trust based purchase, but it worked, and i'm the first one to ever buy a game of HotS with bitcoin!

I can't find the article, but I found this on bitcointalk

I hope like a hoper that this happens! Then I can buy all kinds of Btc for nothing!

Would you consider writing a post on r/bitcoin explaining how it was in the "bad ol days" when btc was falling from the trees? Newbies like me would love to hear the war stories :D
@_date: 2013-04-25 11:49:08
Paypal is a poor business model that exists only because there is a greater demand for online payment methods than there is supply.  Bitcoin should fix paypal's business model of randomly stealing money from merchants, by eliminating the need for their poorly run organization.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:38:16
I think it will continue to rise personally.  There are massive indicators: 
Al Gore commenting on it, a very strong showing during a recent "blip", simplicity, usability, fun, etc.  
I really hope it goes 100$, then crashes back down to the 50's level. Then it will stabilize and repeat! It's gonna be so much fun to watch.
That being said, I am only buying small amounts monthly and only buying what I fully expect to lose.  
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:46:58
Yea I learned real quick, much better to just use it inside the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:16:28
This is exactly how I was convinced of it.  I downloaded bitcoin wallet, received some chinga and now its bazinga zippity bippity boop.

I put exactly .01 BTC into that account, which it turns out is the minimum tip amount.  Or I did something wrong :(

paying-it-forward is amazing.  I think it works with bitcoin because there are a few high value individuals who make us all feel good, then we can go out and spread the word like an army of ants.
And you there's that added value of, you know, feeling good.
thanks for the internets!
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:41:55
The best way to show a company like them that it works is to set up your own store, buy their products, and accept bitcoin as the payment.  You then charge a small nominal fee for the transaction, ThinkGeek see's you making money, realizes they can do the same and shuts you down.  Mission accomplished.
Which is why I love the openbitcoinstore concept.
