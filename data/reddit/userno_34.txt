No, I'm talking about continents... a land mass is still a land mass no matter what it's called and everybody agrees on that but continents are arbitrary areas that human beings invented and varies based upon what your specific country teaches. 
[Taking this directly from Wikipedia]( 
    The seven-continent model is usually taught in most English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom[22] and Australia,[23] and also in China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and parts of Western Europe.
    The six-continent combined-Eurasia model is mostly used in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Japan.
    The six-continent combined-America model is often used in Spain, Latin America,[24] Greece,[14] Portugal, France and its former possessions, Italy, and Romania.
    A five-continent model is obtained from this model by excluding Antarctica as uninhabited. This is used, for example in the United Nations[25] and in the Olympic Charter[26] in its description of the Olympic flag.
I've read books in Spanish that explicitly show America as being just one continent and not north - south.

People in different countries are taught different things. Here in the UK, we were taught growing up that there is just North America and South America. I lived in Colombia and Mexico for over a year and everybody I met from there just sees it as one giant continent, "America"... others are taught that it is split up further with central America included as well.
