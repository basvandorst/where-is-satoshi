Can I stay here master lol? Great that you only see small part of your post lol 'Clapping and laughing at other people's pain? How gracious and sympathetic of you. If you think it sucks, perhaps do something else with your time?'
Feel free to stay here and try to understand yourself and your great art of reasoning... assumption  (also: supposition, conjecture, guess, presumption) yes yes you did it and of course you failed to troll me...

1. For the next bubble you will wait much longer than the first.
2. I bet it will reach like 150-200 and then it will retreat again.
3. As far as I see how this market is manipulated (as any other) in long term I would tell sell. Next peak will be lower than last. 
4. Btw. the whole idea of bitcoin is one big scam in my opinion. Another ponzi scheme made by geeks for geeks and criminals.
