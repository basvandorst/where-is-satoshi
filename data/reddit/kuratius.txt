Human species secret code of conduct happens to state that you don't emphasize your humanity unless you have a reason to.
There are a ton of other rules, learning them all as an outsider was tough. How's Magrathea this time of the time year?

I'll be frank with you: If you knew what a normal distribution is and that the IQ is designed to be normally distributed around 100 points as the mean, you'd understand what he's talking about. His only fallacy is assuming that IQ is directly linked to education. Which isn't an unreasonable assumption, but it's not rigorous.

Pretty sure manuals are required by law to have a proper translation by a certified translator.
I recently read a manual where the English translation was Google translate level crap (probably outsourcing to Indians or something because of the way some sentences were phrased) and you had to guess what it meant while the German version was perfectly understandable.
The same law should probably apply to business websites but likely does not atm.
