A centralized website with a centralized decision (probably manipulated) has dropped the price by thousands instantly, and has manipulated the entire market.  Seems that we are stupid enough to have linked all the decentralized investments and our energy into a centralized price feed.  WSJ probably want to sell their own, which is still centralized, that’s their motivation of flashing out the corrupt, or incompetent coinmarketcap.com

Probably like 99.9% of population you have no idea what bitcoin really is.  It is like the discovery of the financial DNA.  People will be able to store value on an immutable chain.  Censorship resistant, unstoppable, transparent transactions. One country can send 1 billion to another within minutes. LTN enables micro transactions probably millions per second in the future.  Even if major powers collide, you need nobody to guarantee or back the value of bitcoin. When humans go to other planets transactions will be sent via satellites.  It is a new form of gold that is liquid.

Yes. True value determines the production cost. But the actual quality of the product is the amount of energy put to secure the network. 1 BTC in 2009 was much LESS secure than 1 BYC in 2019

This very comment above, is analyzed by powerful NLP algorithms to detect the best time to invest when the psychological cycle of an asset is in the “despair”
zone.  Experienced investors are slowly accumulating and trying to keep the prices as low as possible.  Then they sell during the next “hype”
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:42:04
These guys know what they are doing, they will enter at the best time possible.  My estimate is around 5200, because the best analysts around such as Tony Vays predict a nadir of ~4900.  This is a game of chicken, they will enter approx. +300 dollars higher, then say goodbye to 4900 for ever.  Next think you know 20k 40k 100k, VCs make a huge profit and stupid little guys sold their positions at 6000
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:23:36
Yes, i suspect they have been, but all the evidence points to increasingly more “over the counter” purchases as the price gets lower.  I don’t think they manipulate the overall market, that panics like a herd of elephants who saw a mouse, but they have been experienced enough to know when to enter with robust positions

Fibonacci levels indicated that it will hit 5000.  I found my self wondering that now that the forked was called off what will happen ... it seems that the human FUD nature will find a way to deescalate all this enthusiasm and one way or another lead to a correction.  Reminds me of the back to
The future movies, where whatever you do you cannot avoid a correction.  To be honest, this is good news which indicates that the BTC market is a healthy market which follows the human psychology laws and the market oscillators and not a bubble.  What we will see is a drop to 5K and then 10K by end of December 2018, 50K by the end of 2018.  BCC will get stronger but will never replace BTC, because other coins are much better for cash purposes, DASH, ZEN, CLOAK, ZCASH, XMR etc

Excellent perspective. The Noah’s ark is something I did not think about and makes absolute sense. It will allow the underdogs - the ones who will refuse to enter the financial Tyranny of the Antichrist (whoever needs/she will be). By definition the Bitcoin cannot be centralized under the authority of one entity/ person.  
Worst case scenario: SAToshi is the Antichrist and comes as a pseudo-savior demanding everyone to use bitcoin by force to “save them”
Besides if Satan had a currency wouldn’t be nice to call it **SAT**?

Exactly. Was thinking in the same lines.  I think what is coming and was described 2000+ years a go is awfully accurate. A mathematical system with a mark (original word “Mark” is translated from the Greek “charagma” which means more of a scar or an imprint).  Talking about a dual implant system forehead and hand, in a nightmare world of monitoring every transaction where there is a centralized monitoring system.

Not sure. Perhaps none of these are the mark of the beast. They describe this as an irreversible mark, perhaps is CRISP DNA editing that embeds the private keys within the DNA?  Good input though. From what I read is not so much the act of having a system of transaction like a credit card, but is the sacrilegious act of making the Creators beings as things, and the acceptance of it by us.  What troubles me is the irreversibility of it and microchips can be removed

The next worse move is to sell when it hits 5000–an expected Fibonacci level... Hold your coins and sell in a year.   If you do that you may enjoy 2-3x profits.  Buying at mid-7000s is still cheap BTC, seriously.  Focus on the forest, not the tree
@_date: 2019-12-04 03:34:02
Yes. I suspect that’s why Jesus got upset with the merchants in the Temple. They were worshipping a false god within the Temple of his Father
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:26:38
Possibly. I think you have great points. I have no idea what the mark of the Beast will be, but is concerning to many Christians.  If someone comes with a nano 2FA NFC chip few micrometers that needs to be on a finger and the forehead and need with your finger to touch your forehead to activate the 2FA an unusual movement that will not happen accidentally, will totally freak me out as a Christian and that’s where I would say - put me in jail, I am not doing this.
And let’s say that your entire life savings is stored on your hand what if you lose your hand or finger in an accident? Poor country gangsters are known to chop of hands to steal Rolex watches ... what if the forehead is an embedded cold storage technology in the frontal lobe which will pass on the PIN to the finger NFC but cannot be extracted with you being tortured to give out your pin, since you don’t really know it, but stored in a neural network in your brain?
What if your brain needs to be alive to pass on the 2FA, and if people chop of your head immediately the cold storage gets deactivated?  Not far fetched for 20-30 years from now...
What if the neural network immediately gets shut off in extreme stress/ torture conditions/ what if a 6G network will keep your neural networks connected to the internet so can made transactions without a cell phone?

Not really. Millions die in wars for money. If a person becomes a bank let’s say has a billion dollars on him/her all the time, anyone would accept an unhackable neural implant with a smart contract that says if your brain becomes inactivated to secure the funds in a trust. This would be the mark of the beast and Money will be a False God. The chip on the hand will be just the “PIN” but will need the “forehead” (frontal lobe) to approve the transaction. 
Well this may happen and physical money and banks will be gone and nobody will be able to buy or sell without this system — and they will say, “just a coincidence”

if it will go up, it will be abrupt and sudden.  People will wait to go down to buy some more and will keep going up and up.  Finally when it goes to 100K they will give up and buy then it will crash to 20K, and then same story again to 250K

By being Pseudo-anonymous the public (the Demos) can peer-review the money flow.  Completely anonymous could boost human/ weapons/ drug trafficking.  I am not saying that a

i have been thinking about for a year now and i have just reached a conclusion;  When shall i start spending bitcoin for everyday transactions?  Answer when the price stabilizes.  When this will happen?  When it will find widespread acceptance = when significant proportion of the population becomes a stakeholder through retirement funds, ETF etc.  Then volatility will go down and price will be stabilize.  People will have the option to get payed in bitcoin and spend bitcoin cents daily (aka Satoshi)
