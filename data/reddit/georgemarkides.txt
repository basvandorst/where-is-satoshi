you do admit that you have mentioned Neo and Bee in a positive light on various occasions. If I am not mistaken you have mentioned them during an interview with Max Keiser on the Keiser Report (correct me if I am wrong) as well as twitter. 
Unfortunately, **anything you say can be misconstrued as investment advice**. It's something that we in the financial sector know all too well, when we publicly take a position on something chances are we will influence some members of the public and we will be held accountable in the public eye if our projection or rationale doesn't pan out. 
For what it's worth I was sceptical about Neo and Bee from early on, but I kept silent despite signs that this company was a no go, bitcoin or no bitcoin. To be honest, had I known that it would end up like this I would be screaming till my lungs bled.
In my opinion Neo was going to fail anyway, even if Brewster was sincere (best case scenario), or it could be an outright scam (worst case scenario).
Due to the lack of evidence which way this would swing I decided to shut up and wait, failure is part of the game and completely acceptable, fraud isn't. 
So this is my friendly advice to you, from now on be cautious.
**You seem all too eager to endorse everything bitcoin and your enthusiasm may cloud your judgement.** 
Take care.

I think this is a fairly accurate timeline. 
I would like to add just a few things. 
a) Neo and Bee sold shares OTC. A shareholders list (blockchain addresses) was hosted on lmb-holdings.com (a whois query revealed that this page belongs to Danny Brewster), the page was taken down shortly after Danny posted his 1st message on bitcointalk.org after he went missing. 
b) the prospectus was also deleted from Google drive where it was initially hosted. This happened after Tuur De Meester, Antonopoulos and Neo and Bee employees addressed the issue. 
I've made backup copies of the prospectus but I was unable to retrieve the shareholders list, google cache latest image was taken on the 15th of March.

As the author of the article titled "Neo and Bee" over at Medium.com I have noticed that my post has been (for lack of a better term) PARADED around on these threads as evidence that Neo and Bee failed because it was involved with Bitcoin! 
Despite my own reservations towards BTC Neo and Bee did not fail because of bitcoin. In fact if one reads carefully my post they will notice that I explicitly wrote: 
**under no circumstance is Neo and Bee exemplary of the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, merely one bad apple that could've should’ve been excised early on.**
**It is absolutely inconsequential whether Neo and Bee invested in gold/silver/corn or any other commodity.**
Just wanted to clear the air. 
Thank you.

I fear this was a **pump and dump scheme.** 
Now this is very speculative and I can't prove one single iota because Brewster made sure he deleted his tracks. So take this with a grain of salt and consider this the worst case scenario.
In the company's prospectus we see that 38.5% of shares were to be sold to investors while the remaining 61% was held by LMB-subsidiaries the parent of Neo and Bee. 
LMB subsidiaries sole owner as per the file I obtained from the UK's companies registrar is Danny Brewster initial capital 1 Pound Sterling. 
Danny raises 10K BTC from Neo's IPO. Spends a lot to make Neo and Bee appear as a legit business sending its share price skyrocketing. Then sells his 61% share (remember Neo and Bee CFO asked Havelock to suspend trading due to abnormal trading patterns) and rakes in the money.
I checked their charts over at Havelock and I noticed that around February a month before Danny went MIA, Neo's share price fell and was trading in high volumes. This can only be explained if someone was selling lots and lots of shares. Since problems wouldn't surface for another month and Neo was still basking in the spotlight (therefore existing investors were bullish on Neo) that leads me to believe that **Danny dumped his 61% cashing out**
Another indicator that this may be the case is the fact that Neo and Bee sold shares outside Havelock Exchange. There was a shareholders list on LMB-holdings.com but that page was taken down. **I did a whois query and the page was registered by none other than Danny Brewster.** 
**Roughly speaking that would get Danny 20-30mn USD.**
Again this is very speculative and IMO is the worst case scenario. The fact that he left without giving any coherent answer as to why, only raises my suspicions. As for his replies on bitcointalk.org and reddit I think they were intended to confuse stakeholders and buy him some time before authorities were alerted.
