If there was really that much evidence, it would be trivial for you to cite it here.

There wasn't a real logical point from you in the first place.


Why would she do that? How would it benefit her? She would still have to live in the world she destroyed. It doesn't make any sense.

Nice ad hominem and avoiding the question.

I just found a Kanye attribution to Daft Punk lyrics on a crypto subreddit

Well, to be honest, djdjkdk's post is FUD. Once they no longer control 51% of hashing power, they will no longer have the power to do bad things (like double spend). Confidence in bitcoin in general may be damaged as a result, but there will be no lasting technical damage.

Regardless of how much hashrate they control, they can hide some of it. Like you said, they could be forwarding some of their hashrate to an unknown pool or some other pool. Or they could submit blocks through a node other than their own, making it look like they weren't the first to report it. All we know is they have at least what is reported on the blockchain.info graph.

What? The blockchain is public. We will be able to see if they've done something nasty.
What do you think they can do that we wouldn't realize for years? With 51% of mining power, all they can do is
1) Prevent certain/all transactions from being put into the blockchain
2) Attempt to do a double spend attack
They CANNOT manipulate the blockchain at will. They CANNOT create random transactions. They CANNOT make protocol changes.
Yes, it is really bad that they control 51% of the mining power of the network. But it isn't as bad as you are saying.

They can't just add protocol changes. If they do, they'll just fork and be mining worthless coins by themselves. The rest of the network doesn't have to accept their changes.

Because faster and more efficient ASICs will be developed.

Where do you think the chips they had went? Into the trash?

You'd think so, but everyone makes mistakes from time to time.

It sounds like he planned to give his friend money in the form of a check. Which is, in my opinion, a great wedding gift.
Bitcoin would be fine too, for those who understand what it is. Sounds like the groom either had some foreknowledge or an open mind.

My purchase changed to "complete" less than two hours after they had predicted it would.

Are you serious? People used to trade gold for goods and services daily. It's only relatively recently that the world has moved away from that.
