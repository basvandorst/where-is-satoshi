You don't understand what "ad hominem" means, lol. You small-blocker shill.

So you are asking me not to insult you by calling you a shill, and implying that I am a "troll"? lol. Trollscore 2 out of 10: You're barely trying. I could bend you in half like a tiny girder, wimpy human.

What a horrible idea. I hope the community and the miners can rise up against this centralized takeover attempt.

Did Chairman Greg tell you that?

Talk to your bank, try to have the transaction reversed for fraud and if the recipient's ID is known, report them to the police. OneCoin is like fucking ScientologyCoin, they prey on the weak.

You know that old saying "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose"? Yeah, well, you're young and all but having $300k at your age is a very rare and lucky thing that very few people experience, and you should count your blessings and take some profit while you can. Take a year off and travel, but I'd save at least a third straight into a 401k / IRA as fast as possible with yearly contributions.

Is that a Seth Rich reference?

Never heard of anything like that. No idea what you're talking about ;)

Fuck that noise. Segwit is the end of Bitcoin.

This definitely appears to be the largest robbery of all time. Funny the guy responsible has already been let out of prison even though the funds have not been recovered, if you ask me.

Me and a whole army of other people who were already banned from this echo-chamber.

Everyone started using Eth instead because it actually works.
