Yes, Ada, C, Assembler, old stuff. You don't have to go that old, just don't use hipster stuff (JavaScript) on the back end.

No I came across this and than investigated further

What a load of CRAP. You can just make it public domain to begin with. When Bitgo goes out of business, which it will, the next company/troll that owns this patents will likely cause a lot of damage to the community. 
PS: if you have a problem with Reddit and our community stop posting your PR crap here.

That's right, but you can have a preemptive contract giving it's future ownership to someone else.

Bullshit! 
Why didn't they just release as GPL or pledge to transfer ownership to Apache?
They copy the code from (BitcoinJS) then, fucked it up losing customer's funds and now what to patent the bits they changed.

That's what start-ups with little traction and too much money do, they fight dirty. They could always just drop the claim and let it be public domain.
Edit: new hashtag bitgo is now on Bitcoin shit list, ** 
Best put here

No just tired of bullshit and empty claims.
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:05:59
That's bullshit, there is many ways to go about it. Sign a piece of paper assigning this patent ownership to Apache Foundation then.

In reality It's more like around $20-50K per patent. You need a patent lawyer and a lot of hours.

Incorrect. See this

If you can't even get Javascript done properly, **How about you stop calling yourself the "Leading Bitcoin Security Solution" then?**
@_date: 2015-05-01 00:08:15
We heard those words before, how about just dropping the claim then?

Can BitGo give Bitcoin reputation a break and stop screwing up? I want to enjoy my weekend.
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:30:53
That's cute, but not for financial products.
There are real languages you know, Python (Pycoin), Java (BitcoinJ), C, C++, etc... 
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:27:14
That's the problem right now. Companies like BitGo have no traction with their shitty tech, so they patent stuff to justify VC investment.

@_date: 2015-09-22 20:27:13
Didn't they just lose customer money, applied for patents and have lot's of bugs?

Many prior P2SH transactions but they could still troll if this left unattended.
