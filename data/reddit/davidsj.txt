It's almost as if this conundrum could be solved by some sort of technology for the verifiable timestamping of digital signatures.

Anyone try to trace the originating IPs of these transactions? Might not reveal much if they're Tor nodes. but even that would be worth knowing.

Miners setting the size of their own block will have no impact on fees. See microeconomics 101, competitive markets, supply and demand curves.

That's the first time I've seen the sunk cost fallacy described as rational thought.

You may be thinking about it reversed. The inability to withdraw and spend mtgox dollars makes mtgox dollars less valuable (as measured in bitcoins or anything else), it doesn't make mtgox bitcoins worth more. Hence, the inability to exchange something for something else decreases its value, and the ability to do so increases it.

No, a deflationary wife will be hoarded and increase in value but not be exchanged.

That's fair, it is far enough in the future that it's probably irrelevant, and the value of bitcoin may rise a fair amount in that time also (although $10 million is over-optimistic, that implies ~$100 trillion in total value, more than all the monetary base in the world currently).

We don't know, and we shouldn't have to guess.  If they published it under their own name we wouldn't have to.
This incident -- particularly their deafening silence -- is making me rethink my high opinion of Coinbase and my willingness to trust my money with them at all. They still have a chance to make this right but the longer it goes the more it'll hurt them.

As I wrote [last year]( the marginal cost of processing one more transaction (assuming you're already mining a block) is so unimaginably tiny, and dropping with Moore's Law, that it might as well be zero. Keep in mind that to process one more transaction you just have to validate its signature, you don't have to do repetitive hashing.
Fees would be so small that they are effectively zero, whether they are exactly zero or not. This doesn't matter much now since there's still the 25 BTC block reward, but one day in the future when there are few bitcoins left to be mined, the transaction fees are all that will keep miners mining. If the transaction fees go to near zero, then the hashrate will drop accordingly, and the network will be extremely vulnerable to attack.

I originally posted a comment disagreeing with you, but you're right: all the miners have to validate the transaction signatures in order to attempt to mine the block, but only one miner gets the reward &amp; fees, so the cost is effectively lower if there are fewer miners.

The decision to mine bitcoins should have nothing to do with your view of bitcoin's long-term prospects.  It has only to do with whether the current (and near future) exchange rate justifies the mining expense.
If not, and you'd still like to invest in bitcoins long-term, then you're better off spending dollars for bitcoins directly rather than mining them.

You were attempting to give someone sound financial advice.  That imposes its own rules.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:56:04
The original post acknowledges exactly that point.  It is not describing an attempt to keep transactions out of the block chain, just to slow them down significantly.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:50:33
That post has nothing to do with forking the block chain.

You can't just ignore the ability to exchange bitcoins for dollars and vice versa in your "projections".
