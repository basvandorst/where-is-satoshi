What kind of wallet did you send to?

Ok maybe ask u/Devbitcoin as they have helped others on here

Just sharing a link to recovering coins from a Nano S

I'm not sure, sorry. But others have posted on here asking the same question about the Nano S. Worth it to keep digging.

Perhaps I should be rewarded for exposing a flaw...

It was a joke, but thanks for your contribution

Thanks for all your help guys. Just following the process that btctroubadour provided previously, just interchanging LTC with BTC and vice versa.

Update: Thanks to the step by step guide from I managed to recover my Litecoin. I just had to do the opposite as it was originally intended for recovering BTC sent to LTC address.
Cheers all

Thanks for your reply. How long would this take? Some users have said that if it is sent to the wrong address it gets 'burned'. Is this true?
