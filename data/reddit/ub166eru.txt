Has the transaction cost ever factored in the feasibility of your very hopeful investment outcome.
I think it’s more likely for Elon Musk to colonize Mars than for BTC to become a currency.

@_date: 2018-01-23 10:59:19
Face it guys, it will not go back to 16k anytime soon. You need people to panic buy all to drive it all the way up there. But it won’t happen.. people are not going to pile in as crazy like they did before. Before the crash nobody was willing to sell, and many oeople wanted to buy.
You won’t get that situation anytime soon. Instead you will get many people capitulating and chtting there losses. 
I predict lower prices the coming months.
Take your profits. It’s silly to hope to be able to cash out higher. You won’t be able to. 10k for 1 bitcoin is a nice price! That’s 10x more than a tear ago. Don’t be blinded by greed.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:27:27
Similarly in 2014, there were plenty bull traps before it got to 200. Same is happening now.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:55:48
It was way cheaper a few months ago, what do you mean for sale?
Lower highs, lower lows. The trend has clearly reversed. Sell them expensive for nice 1000% y/y profit. Cone back in a year and buy back them much lower.
Prices will go lower. Don’t be the greater fool.

I just decided to put my money where my mouth is and opened a short position of 0.2 BTC at 11840.
This is only about 2% of my total (stock) portfolio, or 1% of my net worth (other half is in a house).
I will cut my losses if BTC goes back up above 16k.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:33:26
It’s a classic bull trap in the initial stages of a crash
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:24:06
It is, lower highs, lower lows, that’s how a bubble pops, cause everyone is still blinded by greed and can’t believe it’s over. It’s thise that get out the last that lose the most.
It’s going to trade below 10k for most of 2018.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:30:16
Most prople wrongly call it over. This is just the beginning of lower prices. I’m looking to short it once it’s back up around 15k
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:38:49
No best to buy 1-2 years after. Typically an asset becomes death money for 1-2 years before it appreciates again, no need to panic buy!
In fact, sell all your BTC now. You’ll be able to buy them back cheaper in January 2019.
This is my personal view. 
Feel free to get back to me in a years time to tell me how wrong and stupid I was.

No matter how much you believe in bitcoin, if you had a nice ride, now is a good time to get out.
It will continue making lower highs and lower lows, not sure where it will settle. But the current sentiment is still mostly disbelief that the massive rally is over, that means many people will wait still before they go to the exit.
If you sell now you’ll be able to buy back your bitcoins cheaper in 6 months time than what they trade at today.
You don’t have to believe me and feel free to get back

@_date: 2018-01-17 21:01:55
Wrong! Most people are like you, blinded by quick paper profits, they don’t believe it’s over and indeed might be putting even more money in “buying opportunity!”. This is exactly what happens in any market crash! Lower highs, lower lows, people hoping the market will turn causes these dead bounces. People only head for the exit when it wiped out a significant amount of their profits or when they are looking at a net loss.
If you want to make money, don’t do what everyone else does, especially not in a bear market.
Get out. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:26:54
It’s a classic bull trap. It’s difficult to make day to day predictions, but I’m betting bitcoin will be below 10k in 30 days.

@_date: 2017-12-11 10:37:57
Correction: Traders will hedge with Bitcoin. If there is masive difference in price, you betcha that someone is going to do that trade! You can both long and short the future. If the future is leading, you don't even need to move bitcoins between exchanges.

nonsense, why were all the cellphone companies selling these crappy phones wich functioned like handicapped awkward smartphones? Some had a crappy camera, some had WAP-internet access. None had a convenient touch screen. Apple was not in that market. All one of them had to do was look ahead, invest heavily and take a big leap to come up with a big improvement to what was in the market. But instead they just kept adding little features with incremental steps. If it wasn't for apple, we wouldn't have had decent smartphones that early on. 
You need money to invest heavily in research and development, for this you need to branding, appeal to people, etc.. 
How much is something worth? The price people pay for it! It looks like a lot of people are willing to pay as much for an iPhone as it is priced... Whether it is the hardware, the software, the design, the support, the innovation... these people are buying something.

I use similar schemes. There are plenty of similar methods you can come up with. If you are creative its very unlikely someone will think up the same method, even if they do they will need to know that I use that method (which I havent shared with anyone), so I dont see how it could be cracked. 
e.g. Somewhere on my massive harddisk (and my backup) there are some html pages I made when I was 12 just because I wanted to learn some 'programming'. I could use the md5sum of this file, together with say one of the titles of one of the webpages, or just the name of my favorite dish in German or that one the thing I will always remember about my dad (or whatever) take those together (maybe even mingle them, 3 chars from one , 2 from the other etc...) replace all occurances of 'e' with 103, and use the hash of this as a passphrase.... 
Again easy to remember, way too arbitrary/random to hack....

I remember when the iPhone came out, a lot of people were like 'wow damn that phone combines a lot of good stuff and improvements in one release...'. Didn't remember any other similar phones coming out at the time... I'm not an expert on that market so it might be that I just didn't know of them. Which sort of proves my point again: Marketing is important if a company wants to cash out it's innovation...  Remember that apple had not foot whatsoever in that market... From a business point of view what they did was brilliant and indeed successful.. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:31:40
Wrong, people providing short selling are not necessarily taking upon risk that they didn't have already. 
Here is how it works outside Bitcoin land:
Big Hedge funds, pension funds, that have a huge amount of Stocks, ETFs, government bonds, or what have you on their Balance sheet that they are HODLING for a substantial time (can be anything between a few months and years), will happily lend out a fraction of those stocks (say 20%) to day traders, charging them a fee for it. 
As you cant opt out of a certain investment strategy with a pension fund or hedge fund every 5 minutes, they are pretty certain they will be holding those 20% in a given time. Why not earn some extra bucks lending it out to a day trader? 
I'll happily lend out my bitcoins to a day trader (under well-agreed upon conditions, etc... ) to short if I receive a bit of a fee for that.. I'm not selling them soon anyway.

No it's called market making. arbitrages is when two bid/ask spreads of different trading venues are in cross (never happens in one market, because the matching engine would match those trades automatically). Arbitrage opportunities in the real world are hard to come by.. but there are still companies doing pseudo arbitrage between correlated products.

Well.. If I have no money at all, make a coin that eventually replaces the national currency due to popularity, while I keep 20% of the coins myself, I suddenly hold about 20% of the nations wealth... While for the other people nothing has changed: 
Assume for simplicity that there would be one global currency and one bank that keeps an online ledger of it. If today some Robin Hood type hacker would succeed in hacking the banks computers and redistribute all the money in existence equally amongst all citizens. What would happen? Would suddenly everyone be equally wealthy? No! And here is why: 
Come monday, those that own and control petrol sources, and other resources, will still be able to ask as much money for the things people want/need. While the poor have nothing to offer and will lose most of their money very soon by having to spend it on essential goods, while not having a way to obtain new money. It would not be long before the bank account statements catch up with reality. 
In the case of premining its economically equivalent to someone succesfully forging 20% of the nations money, he would indeed become very rich. While the rest only benefits from the low transaction costs of the new currency...
Also whose doing the mining to safeguard transactions and prevent double spending? The whole point of cryptocurrencies is that all of this is distributed. Read about 51% attack...

Oh please tell me how anyone can analyze the market the right way and make good investments. 
Nobody can predict the market. So his investment was not better an no worse than someone spending hours looking at charts and candle sticks. 
There are investments, trades and positions that are only profitable for a day/week or even microseconds... So saying 'if his investment was good one week, it was still good the week after' does not necessarily hold. You might for example buy when everybody is hyping about bitcoin, see the price moving up considerably and expect prices to fall at some point. You might estimate the likeliness of this greater in the next week, and just be happy to take your profit and not remain exposed. 
Making a shit ton of money on one hand doesn't mean you are a good poker player either. One that estimates the probabilities well and plays with them in mind is a better player. But that doesn't mean that someone who doesn't know the probabilties but spots a huge bluff and wins big on that hand due to following the more subjective sentiments played bad...

I agree, 
I had a credit card, recently moved to the Netherlands for new job, cancelled the bank accounts and credit card in my home country, because my new Dutch bank promised me a credit card. Because I had no wage history, I got a letter from Mastercard declining me a credit card. Total fucking bullshit! All the hassle... it's fucking ridiculous... 
Instead of waiting re-applying for a credit card, I now play poker with bitcoins (which I acquire through SEPA transfer and iDeal payment). I've also used them once on a webcam site, which was very easy. Something I would never have done with my credit card, because I am skeptical handing over my credit card details and identity.... 
I've ordered food with bitcoins several times.. There is definitely a Niche in payment processing that Bitcoin is perfectly placed to fill... 
No matter what happens to its price, I'll very likely keep using Bitcoins for certain things, not out of evangelical conviction, but just because it is convenient and without hassle...

Yeah I'll look into it and call my bank during my lunch break. Debit cards are very handy, It's what I used when I lived in the UK. But not sure if they are used here in the Netherlands... also in my Home country nobody seems to have those. You can pay a lot of stuff online in a debit card kind of way with online payment system like iDeal in the Netherlands, but for flight tickets you need a credit card (or debit card of course). 
I don't really need 'credit', don't really like the idea of buying something with money you don't have yet... I just need it for certain payments and accounts (spotify, itunes). So debit card is probably what I need...

As a payment system butcoin has some advantages over others. People wanting to use this payment system (to pay less, save money) will need bitcoins, therefore there is a demand, because there is a limited supply this means they will have value. The fact that they are infinitely divisible doesn't matter: for all practical purposes gold can be divided in smaller qauntities, still 1 ounce of gold has a certain value.
It's also useful to compare bitcoin to fiat. Fiat is not backed by anything, the govenment forces merchants to accept it but that doesn't give it its value, there is no way for the goverment to control the price
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:38:41
There is no way to estimate the risk here. Your assumption of long term profit is based on your SPECULATION that bitcoin will last and grow. Even though I'm bullish myself, lets not forget that this remains speculation, we can't possibly estimate the probability of Bitcoin's success. So with an uncertain long term profit, a smaller short term profit can be justified.. All depends on your probability estimates of the succes and payioff of both strategies against eachother...

I don't know... I had a debit card when I lived in the London, but I haven't seen them when I lived in Germany or the Netherlands. Don't know if they have them here... 
Anyways, I called Mastercard, they said it was the banks fault for promising me a credit card and that they evaluate these thing by their own criteria. That I used to have a credit card and wage history (never had any debts anywhere), that my wage is quite high and rent pretty low and all that didn't seem to matter. So they required me to ask my employer to write a letter of intend to pay me... I know I shouldn't take these things personally but I felt a bit insulted as I was one of their loyal customers, happily paying their interest fees for the convenience... 
I didn't go back to the bank (really didn't feel like taking a day off just for this kind of stuff). I didn't try to get the credit card.. 
I manage quite well without one, and the good thing is I never spend more than I have (because I can't).. putting some of my wage into bitcoins, to pay for stuff has been a good way of saving up some money in the past year, of course I was very lucky with the price increase.. But I really hope bitcoin takes off soon, so that I will never need to request a credit card...

People will stil remain pessimestic eventhough the outlook for bitcoin is better. It will take a while before the masses start looking at investing in bitcoin again, only then will the price start going up significantly. Can take up to 3 months or more. 
I have a considerable postion in bitcoin, but dont dare to trade out of it because im not certain that the peice will drop significantly further either an I dont want to buy back higher...

It's you not understanding HFT. Perhaps what you speak of are scenarios you've seen on Bitcoin exchanges? I'm no expert on that.. In that case it's the exchanges fault for their lame matching engine. This is not possible on Eurex, CME, ... Market makers have to be able to update their volnurable open quotes/orders quickly when the market moves, currently that happens in the range of microseconds, but apart from the speed which is due to obvious technological developments, the principle is the same and the strategy of market making is over hundereds years old. 
Without market makers there is less volume, which means more volatility and bigger spreads, which means you pay more to buy, get less for selling.... 
Just look up how the spreads have tightened in the stock and option markets over the past 20 years. That's due to speed (=HFT), because when Market Makers are able to updates their quotes faster they need less credit (spread) to cover their risk. 
Don't take my word for it. Im happy to point you to some academic articles on the matter...

To convert currencies on the spot, you need to hold an inventory of it.

If there is a spread between bid an ask, it means people are willing to buy from you at say 98, and willing to sell it to you at 102. You can dime their bid offer spread by quoting 99-101. But as long as nobody is trading with you, there is not a riskless opportunity (i.e. arbitrage) here. You have to be able to both buy and sell at the same time to make a riskless profit. With your 99-101 you are only able to do that when someone buys from you at 101 and someone else sell to you at 99. if the market is stable, price around 100, and there is equal buying interest as selling interest, then sure this is easy money. But if bad news breaks out and everbody is selling to you at 99, and you don't update your prices fast enough, you are stuck with a huge position which you might only be able to trade out of at say 80... You just lost a whole lot of money. 
Not arbitrage:
bid price = 15 , ask price = 17
bid price = 17 , ask price 15 (you can buy at 15 and sell at 17)
You can see now that arbitrage can only happen on different market, because in the same market at trade would immediately occur between the person willing to pay 17 and the person willing to sell at 15... 
It's not arbitrage, educate yourself.

I started with bitcoin in july 2013. Picking an exchange, it didnt take much googling to know that a lot of Bitcoiners didnt like Gox, that withdrawing fiat was a problem... If a lot of clever bitcoin nerds dislike Gox, there must be a reason for that (fishy behaviour, bad support) etc... When looking into how bitcoin works (which you ought to do with any investment, Look into it!) It didnt take long to read and understand that paper wallets are the safest way to store coins! I trade in and out of bitcoin 2 or 3 times a week and it only takes me about 5 minutes to wipe my paper wallets and transfer my coins to the exchange. Unless you're a high frequency trading bot, there is absolutely no reason to keep your coins in your exchange account. 
TL;DR if you know how bitcoin works and what the risk are you know that you only truly own any bitcoin when you have the private key. Exhanges are handy, but risky for coin storage.

Its not hard science but in absence of more details its w pretty good way of seejng whether a change is significant enough to draw our attention 'something is happening'.

If your a serious investment fund you should have at least 1% of your portfolio invested in Bitcoin.

Its not like he doesn't care, a bit order will always move the market, because other will test how eager he is too sell, and lower their prices. The only way to sell at the same price is to spread it out, but you risk having to sell at an even lower price. 
TL;DR it is impossible to sell all your coins at once at the current market price.

Indeed, you need bitcoins to make use of the  advantages of the bitcoin system over other payment systems, currencies, remittance systems. Therefore there is and will be a demand for them, therefore they have value. It's that simple!
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:45:25
Better also use your dice for the random number used to generate your private key in the first place. Else your encryption is harder to crack than your private key, because someone might still somehow find some regularity in the private key generator used to generate the private key and that it makes certain keys far more likely to be generated than others, perhaps using this to generate yours (and those of others). unlikely, but more likely than cracking your passphrase used for encryption.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:31:07
Yeah I don't get people's reasoning sometimes. A friend invested 3000 euro's in mining. Putting it into bitcoin he found too risky (what I did with my 1000). This was in July. He could have bought something like 40 bitcoins. Now in february his mining equipment will eventually arrive, he's lucky if he makes 15 coins with it. to him it's still a good investment, and other friends see me as the speculator, while they think he's being clever by making free money... But if it costs you more Bitcoins than you will make, your investment is not clever compared to just buying bitcoins, regardless of what the price does. In fact you are more bearish than someone who just buys bitcoins because you require the price to go up significantly for your investment to be profitable at all....

your first mistake was believing in the wrong God. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 07:53:41
I read a bit about it yesterday and just want to be sure I understand it correctly:
- The address I give someone so he/she can transfer me some coins is a hash of one of my Public keys that will be used for the transfer?
- I assume the key is larger (i.e. contains more characters/bytes) than the hash, so the person won't even know my real public key. But when you have the public key it can be verified it corresponds to the hash, by the hash function, right? 
- If I understand it correctly the public key is used to encrypt the transfer, which can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key in my wallet?
- But how can the transfer be encrypted by the public key if all you give away is the hash of the public key? 
- My wallet is a collection of public and private keys used for transfers. When I open my wallet it uses these keys to retrieve all the transfers it has access to and calculates my balance? And the 100 fresh public/private key pairs in my wallet can be used to make transfers from my wallet?
- So the only thing that defines my bitcoin account and how many bitcoins I hold is a collections of public/private keys that corresponds to transfers? Or is there something else like a unique address that corresponds to my account/balance?
- To protect someone else from using my wallet and draining it by making new transactions, I encrypt the wallet with a passphrase, so only I can decrypt the keys and use those keys in the Bitcoin network?

Just my two cents:
You can have studied all the books in the world, you won't be able to predict what happens after a revolution or apocalypse of sorts. All you have is fantasy. 
Do you think the people in Egypt would have forseen the situation they are in now when they were getting rid of Mubarak? 
Do you think the leninists could have foreseen Stalinism? Often revolutions have eaten their children. 
If you would be able to predict what happens after a revolution, you would be better to put that predictive power to plain vanilla macro economics happening in stable countries, If you were able to predict what the psychology of the hivemind does in even these very slight changes, you would be richer than Warren Buffet in no time. I wonder if you ever even tried? Because if you did you would have realized how difficult it is to predict economic evolution even in stable times let alone in turbulent times... 
I used to be young and naive and hope for a revolution to happen to overthrow everything and make the world a (even) better place. The main reason why I stopped doing that is exactly because I realize it might very well start a system of power that is even worse. It's simply not worth the risk, unless you have nothing to lose. unless your political freedom is being taken away, you are being censored and your family is being killed (Syria), I won't hit the streets and start a revolution. 
Perhpas I'm getting old. It feels like getting wise, but my 14 year old self would disagree heavily and who am I to say that I'm more right now?

I just put as much money as I can save/intend to save in Bitcoin. Then I only have a little left and am forced to not spend too much. if I do want to buy something I try to find if I can buy it with bitcoin.

yeah I work in IT and everybody had sort of heard of it when I arrived 5 months ago, and were skeptical, found it funny or cool but didn't buy any and warned me when I told them I wanted to put some money on them. Then even though they were going up, they still were skeptical. Until I started paying back the colleagues that took me out for lunches with bitcoins. Then Immediately they were checking their mobile wallets throughout the day to see how much their stach was worth. That was 3 weeks ago, now we have a bitcoin ticker displayed on our floor :). 
The best way to introduce people to bitcoin is to help them install a mobile wallet and transfer them some (repay them the drinks they payed you or the money lended), just buy back coins immediately so you dont regret it when the price goes up :)

Look, if it costs you 3 BTC to buys something and you'll only make 2.95 BTC with it then you would have better just hold onto those bitcoins no matter what price (with even the possibility to sell them if the price goes down). I understand if the price goes up you seem to be making money (in USD, EUR, GBP, ...) but you would obviously make more money just having the bitcoins... 
The only reason why I envy you is because I think it's very cool to be a miner and to do this. So kudos for you!
And indeed if the price of Bitcoins increases over the next 200 something days its a pretty good investment nonetheless (better than buying stocks, gold).

Yeah I know. The reason why i wrote this little script was because I was having a discussion with a friend studying finance who called me crazy and warned me with some scary statistics, based on daily volatility. 
Temperature heavily fluctuates on the moleculair level, but I dont really notice this when Im taking a bath (I studied physics). So I wanted to illustrate to him that scales are important and that a large part of the daily volatility is due to low liquidity, orders massively influencing the price and people trying to manipulate the price. But no one is capable of manipulating the longterm trend, which until now has been consistently upwards.
Initially I didnt want to go into a numbers discussion with him based on historical data (he started that). What would statistics have told you in the early days of twitter? Indeed, nothing.

Your mom being dead and your father being handicapped or not has nothing to do with it. I did not see the HiMoM and did not recognize it as a vanity address. I did know about vanity addresses and I immediately knew what stormsbrewing meant with his comment. That you don't just happen to randomly generate an address that starts with HiMoM for a sigh that says 'Hi Mom'. That there must have been a clear intend that that the guy probably therefore still has the private keys of that wallet and that it is worth sending him money. 
I also appreciate that people like you followed up on that explaining vanity wallets so other people who might nog have heard about them can read up on that.

Correction you're being taxed for not doing anything useful with your wealth. My overall philosophy is that everybody should do whatever the hell they want. but I can understand that politicians who feel they need to steer/motivate society in a certain direction opt for such taxes. It's a bit like the subsidies or fiscal benefits for wind and solar power in the EU, they have boosted the technology and innovation around it, not a bad thing if you ask me... 
TL,DR; If there is going to be government taxes and government medling, there are still clever ways and stupid ways of doing it.

How exactly can it loose 100% of its value in 24 hours? This would mean that everybody who currently holds bitcoins deems them worthless. Its not impossible just like its not impossible to survive a free fall from the empire state building. I got news for you friend: the world is uncertain and those who can reasonably estimate risk are the ones that are successful in life. Those who naively fall back on apparant certainties are the losers who end up in the streets because they were not prepared for the abrupt changes in society. He who believes he can work the same steady job in some factory for the rest of his life should urgently read some history books. Buy some bitcoin to diversify your exposure to changes in the money markets.

I dont know how it works in your country, but this is how taxation works in the netherlands: you have to declare how much worth, bitcoins, cash you hold. On everything above 30 000, you have to pay 3%  tax, because if is assumed thats how much profit you should have been able to make with that money. If you convert bitcoins or stocks to cash, 30% of you profit goes to the state. If you spend your bitcoins on goods and services, its just like cash: you pay nothing except the VAT included in the price.

Okay sorry for the repost then. In my defense I didn't find a descent English news source about it anywhere here. 
About it being a 'circle jerk'. Depends what you consider a Circle jerk of course. But I wonder: Do you think it is a circle jerk because you think that if one electronic payment system has problems this does not necessary vindicate any other electronic payment system? Because I fully agree with that!
The thing, is there are a few very powerful things the average person does not fully realize/appreciate: 
- Exponential growth. 
- Complex networks. 
It is mainly the second why in my opinion Crypto currencies are superior, in resilience, compared to centralized (one point failure) payment systems. 
The majority of people don't even know about the topological properties of complex networks and why it would be difficult (read: near impossible) to break the internet. 
It is also impossible to create complex networks by design, they arise organically. (which doesn't mean you can't start and envision them). 
Assuming you are aware of the resilience of complex networks, I take it that you regard this post as a circle jerk because It just plays on this and circle-jerks on this great feat of the Bitcoin (organic growth) network. 
If that's the case I have to disagree with you as I'm fairly certain many people don't realize the strength of complex networks, and hence not the strength and potential of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has gained a lot of mainstream media attention lately and this has caused in influx of people not well acquainted with complex networks. 
So either....  you don't fully appreciates the resilience of complex decentralized networks (like the internet, bitcoin), in which case I highly recommend you [to learn about the intriguing topological features of networks]( 
Or.. you assume that everybody on here is so well informed about this pretty advanced branch of science, that mentioning it or starting a discussion about it is a circle jerk. In which case I think you are wrong, not many people know the strengths of complex networks. I'm pretty sure most bankers don't even know about it.

If you put all you money straight into bitcoin, you still need to eat and buy clothes, the good thing is up until you spend the coins they will have increased in buying power. 
I started to put most of my monthly savings in bitcoins (I have nothing to lose: steady well-payed job, low rent without contract, no kids, no debts). When I bought something with bitcoin I would buy them back right before (more often than not cheaper!)
Now I started to put all my wage straight into bitcoin (after paying rent), and trafer a bit to fiat ecery week :)
In the worst case scenario, that I lose ecerything (which I deem unlikely), I can lend a bit of money for food from friends to survive the rest of the month until I get my next wage.

But you can, like me, completely agree with libertarian ideas about money and monetary systems, but still believe in other things that could be considered statist or socialist by other Libertarians.

Jesus the sentiment of this subreddit becomes a bit too often a childish 'we vs them' mentality.
- Banks, governments, finance people Bad!
- Everything bitcoin good!
You can replicate most of the circle-jerk comments that dont say anything useful nor interesting by just following the above rules.
The financial sector and legislative governments are not as homogeneous as often implied here nor are they necessarily opposed to BTC (as is often assumed here it seems). Maybe you got into BTC because of a need to rebel or some overexaggerated paranoia, and have all been declaring them as your enemy from day one and subsequently as an enemy of BTC. But you are mostly fighting windmills! Often the concerns (if there are any) are about how to fight fraud given BTC and not how to fight BTC itself. 
I wish there was more nuance in the minds of people but I guess the 'shared enemy' and 'us vs them' mentality is delicious circlejerk. But you'd be suprised how many people working in Finance and legislation are supportive of BTC (cause why be against it?).
I work in the financial sector myself (a proprietary trading house, trading for own profits not with other peoples money, not a bank), and I can assure you that most of the sector are individual players who all believen in the values of free trade and enterprise, and it's not at all the bunch of 'uliminati' conspiracy cartels fearing the Nerds with computers. The sector is full of Nerds and liberal minded people (who hold bitcoins and the values underpining bitcoins themselves!). 
I recently spoke to someone working at Bitonic, a company that enables fast buying/selling of bitcoins using Dutch bank accounts. They obviously try to make it as anonymous as possible but are obliged (by their financial partners) to do a check with Dutch phonenumber for the first transaction. This is not a conspiracy of evil Banks and the Dutch government cracking down on the anonymous nature of Bitcoin. No it is quite simply just because Banks in the netherlands have to be able to help if there is suspicion of Fraud. Obviously if some Romanian hackers are able to temporarily get hold of some bank accounts of say Merril Lynch Bank of America by using a fishing website, immediately transferring this money into bitcoins is the perfect way to make it dissappear (and reappear in their own bank accounts). By requiring provision of a Dutch phone number there is an additional check, identity, which makes it a bit more difficult to make the money dissappear and it also provides another point of investigation (where did the cellphone number + dutch bank account come from?). 
Stop fighting Windmills!

It only generates money if the fund increases in value (if the value of bitcoins increases). You can also go short on a derivative which means you make money when the value of the fund goes down. It's a way to increase or decrease your exposure to certain market movements.

A good way to think of the Blockchain:
All of us are sitting in a room, we all hold some amount of bitcoin. A transaction happens when someone publicly anounces he is transfering an amount of his bitcoin to someone else in the room. This is announced out loud and everybody listens. Everybody can see the record of all the transactions that happened. So everybody knows at all times how many bitcoins anyone has, so no body can transfer coins he doesn't have. Now replaces the persons by public addresses that anybody can potentially own, ownership is carried by a matching private key corresponding to the public address. In order to prove you own the public address you need the private key. Transfers are irreversible, anyone having the private key of any public addresses can spend the coins currently held (publicly agreed upon, based on all previous transactions) by that address. So to join the game, you just create a public address - private key pair and let someone transfer you some coins on that public address (for example by paying him for it). Then you keep your private key secret, until you want to spend your coins to someone else his public address for some services.

All it takes is for one country to make it legal, like cypress. Once you can be certain of conversion to a fiat backed by a government you can convert to all fiat. Also, following the developments here in the Netherlands, I think it will never be blocked here, which means conversion to Euro can be taking for granted. Eventually you'll have countries like Gibraltar harvesting the fruits of being bitcoin friendly. Free market competition and the globalized economy will pretty much smoothen the rest out

Nobody is 'expecting' anything from anyone! And nobody owes you any kind of 'smooth service'!!! It's not like bitcoin is McDonalds and you get to be picky about the menu! you're nobodies customer. 
YES, there is an issue with bitcoin not being idiot proof and currently it does still require you to know a bit how it the protocol works in principle. Back in the day when people first started using internet and email it was the same. It will take entrepreneurs to build stuff on top of the protocol to make it completely idiot proof and as smooth using facebook. Things like that are being developed by people who don't just sit back complaining but actually come up with interesting stuff (look into 'Trezor hardware wallet')
Everybody either complains that they didn't know about bitcoin in the baby years or that it's still only in the childhood years....
TLDR; You can't be both an early adopter AND expect the new technology to have matured in an idiot proof way.

I think it would actually makes sense to make different alt-coin for Mars, due to connection issues between Mars and Earth and therefore between Marscoin and Bitcoin. 
When visiting Mars you would transfer your Bitcoin into Marscoin, this might take a bit longer as a normal transaction and the fees for the conversion would be higher than normal tranaction because of the expensive communication channels between Earth and Mars.

this sort of happened to me several times in the last weeks. I did just buy but I was also keeping some aside in case it would go down, but it always went up first and when it went down enough to be considered a dip, the dip price was way higher as at what I bought my other coins 2 days before. 
With the way bitcoin is moving these days the biggest risk is opportunity cost :) 
Anyway I bought most of my coins when it was at $100, I don't think it will every go down to that level, this helps me stay relaxed and watch the price rollercoaster with amuzement. That and the fact that I was prepared to loose the money when I first put it in. The amount it is worth now I would have never invested just like that, but I dont look at being worth that much more like 'very likely worth at least that much and maybe more'

But the essential and important difference it that with bitcoin you dont provide anything to anyone that could give them access to your wallet, that is the big difference with credit card transaction. With bitcoin you sign your transaction with your private key to proof that the coins are yours. The only thing you bring into the network is the signed transaction, the signing can be done offline. This really is an essential point to the fundamentals of bitcoin and how it was envisioned. Sweeping this under the carpet as a minor detail is intellectually dishonest or a sign of ignorance at best. Now go read satoshi's paper and proceed with reading about how the protocol really works.

'And in the end someone else is holding the coins'. Its about ask and demand. If suddenly someone immidiately want to get rid of 40k this will lower the price no matter what.
On an exchage it will eat up most of the buy orders, lowering the price obviously
When it is done off-exchange, somebody has to be willing to buy that many coins while risking a serious downtick. Whoever is at the other deal will have bargaining power. This means he will get them cheaper than the market price, and will most likely immediatly sell off some to be sure of some profit, so in the end no matter what, if there is a big sudden change in ask and demand the market will know about it and the price will chage accordingly.
If the scammers are not stupid they should spread out their sell-off

I dont think it would imeddiately destabilize the value of bitcoin if it is not known that the strategy is being used (which might be difficult to hide if you need that much computing power to be 25% strong). The thing is even if they make it happen once (with a 6%), It's even more unlikely to happen twice in a row or that they will find the 3rd block faster. I think it would be very difficult to stay ahead of the rest, it would be a big gamble, cost a lot of resources not spent on mining the immediate consecutive block, it would be difficult to convince everyone in the mining pool of that strategy without anyone finding out. And eventually when you do manage to stay ahead of the rest and mine significantly more bitcoins than the rest, this statistics will raise questions, and the value of bitcoin might crash.

Your criticism is absolutely justified, there is still a lot of risk to worry about (systemic risk), however if you're traing short term in liquid markets, say as a market maker, hedging does work like that in practise. in option trading yiu would hedgeyour deltas and mainly worry about your remaining greeks, of course your initially hedged deltas change and you need to adjust your hedge. Its still more exact than media predictions.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:12:13
Yes thats exactly what I meant in practice it never hapoens because you are the last in line!
If a company goes bankrupt it definitly doesnt gave enough to pay anything to its shareholders. Its not even indebted anything to them, they just get 'whatever remains'. The reason why companies go bankrupt is because they cannot pay off their debt... So how can amything be left if they are the first to get the assets. 
@_date: 2013-08-08 19:04:56
Yes but ok but thats because they assume that money is pure profit. On holding fiat you already have to pay 1.2% (wich is 30% tax on 4% assumed potential ROI ) if you hold more than 20k. But if you just transfer money between 2 foreign bank account they are not going to charge you 30% raw tax on the sum you transferred... I'll enquire with th compliance officer at my company tomorrow, but I'm pretty sure there is big difference when trades are Forex. Also companies that have foreign activities Hedge their exposure using FX options, It would be ridiculous if they would have to pay tax on the money they managed not too lose (because of their hedge) due to changes in exchange rates

Completely agree.. People get to know about bitcoin and always react the same, sceptical and/or enthousiastic. In their arrogance a lot of people look at it with what they know and what they read about it now. But it's just nothing but history repeating itself every few months. This is what frustrates older bitcoin users and why they might appear crancky, too confident, and unfriendly at times. A lot of the people new to bitcoin have these very understandable but already considered and dealt with objections that have been discussed and thought about so many times in the past year that its frustrating to point out to those new people again ang again that its tiring to explain why they are very likely wrong. Recently someone here posted something that implied I was an early adopter while I only bought coins 7 months ago. I seriously think most of the REAL early adopters dating back from 2011-2012 don't even bother commenting on this subreddit anymore most of the time..

I have all my wealth in Bitcoin. Which is not much I assure you, as I'm young you see.. I'm totally prepared to lose it all, Im not a fool you see... but still pretty confident nobody can undo the invention of cryptocurrencies, whatever their 'theories' might be. I like theories you see, I've studied many great theories in the realm of physics you see.. And allthough I have a great appreciation for macro economics I do laugh at people who take them too serious and don't acknowledge the complexity of what the simplistic theories try to the describe. I cringe and the confidence with which people rely on those theories and don't grasp their lack of fear or doubt that the simplicity might have overlooked some important details of the complexity it tries to describe...

Why I will start buying bitcoins today:
- I finally have some money saved up I can afford to set aside the coming 2 years (or even loose)
- The price today is in line with the slope at which the price of bitcoin was increasing around the 1st of February. 
I will invest in the following way:
Today: buy 100 
the following weeks:
u: price has gone up since last week
d: price has gone down since last week
u +50
        u +40
                u +30
                d +50
        d +60
                u +50
                d +70
d +60
        u +50
                u +40
                d +60
     d +70
                u +60
                d +80
so depending on the price change I will invest between 220 and 310
The idea is that I want to avarage out the price at which I buy a bit, while investing more when it's low and less when it's high. 
I make this 4 weeks plan for myself to stick to and not let myself get emotionally influenced by the fluctuation the coming month. 
After 4 weeks I will review how I have done, and decide what I do next.

@_date: 2013-12-02 09:16:33
I dont know how long you have been waiting for a dip but the price at the dip was still much higer than it last week. If you believe in bitcoin, just buy and put them in cold storage to cash out ib a year/years. Its that simple!

No of course, but not many people have 5000 to invest like that as in 'Its not going to hurt if I loose it'. Probably buying an index or investment fund is the cheapest way to invest with at least some divesification,  you are going to buy the individual stocks yourself you will loose more on transaction costs than you gain from price appreciation, in this sense Bitcoin is cheap. But indeed with 5000 to not care about, I would max invest 1000

The only problem with Bitcoin is that people can't handle the volatility because it hides the true underlying micro dynamics of a steady upward trend. At this very moment the price is equal to what it would be if the slope of price increase around the 1st of februari would have not gone crazy. 
I'm a big proponent of derivatives as it increases liquidity and stable markets. What the Winklevos twins are trying to do would actually achieve this for Bitcoin. This would mean less volatility and more efficient price discovery.

Deflationary currency will not work because nobody will spend it, so everybody will think 'Oh I can buy this bitcoin and I will be able to buy more with it next year, but I better not do this because if everybody does than nobody will spen their money'. 
Not even is it totally against the accepted paradigm that justifies capitalism in the first place (people work for themselves, are greedy), it is also completely wrong. 
Because,... do you seriously think that if everybody would have bitcoin, we would all refuse to spend them and just rather starve and not buy clothes? Maybe we will buy less bullshit like we do now, which is not bad if you ask me. I've never really appreciated this 'buy more, be happy' is good for the economy kind of thing anyway.

Its currently too optimistic, if you currently run a company it is very likely that you won't survive solely on bitcoin, the companies that you buy your supplies from would also need to accept bitcoin. Yes, you could go to an exchange. But what if banks and governments block your bank account because money was sent from that exchange (currently happening!) you might loose a day not being able to pay one of your suppliers not, not being able to get your goods, dissappointed customers.. Its a tough and competitive world, such things can surely set you back! 
Why would it hurt that at least one country totally supports companies that want to build their businesses around bitcoin? All governments and banks would start being careful attacking bitcioin related businesses because they would flee to that country... 
It's all cool to say 'fuck you I don't care' but why want things to be difficult when they go smooth. It's not that bitcoin will not break through eventually, but why do you want to have all this hassle? The sooner governments and banks realize they can't fight it, the better no?

What the bears dont understand is that there are too many nerds, technophiles, and libertarians that want it to succeed and will sit on it 1000 times longer than any clever banker would that's merely looking for a nice ROI to boost his/her bonus. The bitcoin demograph currently holding most of the coins is anything but the demograph that makes up the normal financial system. If you're bearish against bitcoins, well... Good Luck

I dont really care about these small drops, the drops used to be much more crazy. I perceive it near impossible to drop lower than I last bought in. Im watching this with amusement adms Im confident the price will defintely be higher in a year, regardless of these movements. Seriously bitcoin is pretty stable nowadays compared to how it was. I bet none of you scared pussies would ever have managed to hold on to your coins longer than a year if you would have been one of the 'early adopters' you envy so much.

But sure the 'advantage' of paper fiat without gold standard backing it is that our central banks can print it to smoothen its supply and demand. This however causes long term inflation and just hides market shocks. Sure you can buy almost the same goods every hour of the day with one buck, but you'll pay for the hidden market distortions later...

Yes, banks and government could still ban you from dealing with them, which means you would have to go completely bitcoin. As not everyone has bitcoin yet it would currently be a difficult isolated economy to thrive in. 
If a country is like 'we ensure you that you can accept bitcoin and turn it into our currency (and thus other currencies like the dollar) whenever you want' that would seriously help entrepreneurs setting up bitcoin related businesses...

But I have one question: the printing of money is suppossedly done to provide cheap loans to bussinesses to 'help' the economy get over the crises. And even though I dont believe that this actaully works (Im higly sceptical), all the financial markets dip when word comes out that less money (less QE) will be printed because it will be bad for business....

Diversification only makes sense if you have at least 5000 dollars to invest. if you invest 200 dollars per stock, you have to make more than 10% just to cover the transaction costs of your bank/broker. With bitcoin you can buy as little as 100 dollars and dont get burried by transaction costs. The fact that it is so cheap to trade in and out of bitcoin also means that everybody can daytrade, not just professional traders, this is a two-way sword. People will hurt themselves, loose their wallet, etc. But in the end the goal of bitcoin is to be our bank right? This also means that prople will learn the hard way that with great power comes great responsibility..... And will have learn from their mistakes.

No news, the overal trend in bitcoin is growth. The rapid increase in november was due to hype and media attention. The dip/crash was due to panic sellers reacting on bad news, no the growth is picking up again. I had many friends asking me how to buy bitcoins WHILE it was crashing, they did not get scared by the downturn (they had no stake in it) and were just eager to buy some after reading the about the technology (after I pointed them to valuable sources).
People seem to have short memories. Its a bumpy road but it keeps growing, just hold tight and dont panic, when others panic.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:24:26
I once heard from someone that the key to become rich is not to care too much about money. If you care so much that you become greeedy you jump on and off the boat to quick and are just following the hivemind's hype and panic. But same is true if you like your money so much you are not prepared to risk losing and leave it in your bank. 
Only put as much money in something as risky as bitcoin as you are prepared to loose. Only invest if you see potential and if you consider that potential worth holding tight while others behave like mad hens!

You are right about me unecessarily using inflaming and derriding comments. Thanks for still wanting to enter into discussion with me. 
I understand the distrust in BIG instituions and BIG governments, we should always have some degree of that, no matter how friendly we perceive the climat to be. 
But I do want to point out that the financial sector and legislative sectors exist of numerous individuals who don't indentify themselves with the Big governments or financial institutions and act solely individually and regard individiual freedom and free trade as very high values. What I want to counter is a perception of them all being being apostiles of conservative legislation keeping the old systems in place. I think most of them will turn out to be on the side of the Bitcoin community, because it all coincides with their own values of free trade in a meritocratic world. 
Regulation and legislation on its own is not necessarily bad. You can't have trade without private property, you can't have private property without laws an justice. The discussion should be on which laws (if laws at all). 
Bitcoin cannot be outlawed, people will always find ways to trade it 'Over The Counter', like people will always find ways to trade derivatives OTC, or gamble with each other (even if it's outlawed). I send a friend bitcoins the other day in exchange for a painting he made for me, who is ever going to be able to outlaw that? No one, it's impossible! 
While Bitcoin starts to penetrate the economy it is inevitable that it will be named in court cases, that companies who deal in bitcoins will be trailed if they have done wrong to their customers, etc.. I don't think it's wrong to subject companies that deal with bitcoins to laws. The currency itself can not be outlawed anyway. 
I think it would be a good thing if there would be a company who lets people trade in Bitcoins, fast easy and secure, for a small fee, so that the avarage Joe doesn't have to worry about encryption or how it all works, where he just can trust this or that company to worry about that for him, so that he can benefit from the use of the virtual currency, while doing is groceries, buying a house abroad, going on holiday to Mars with his grandchildren etc... For those that don't want to give their trust to a company they can still do everything themselves (which might also be cheaper), and trade OTC.

No evidence, people who are tech minded, have libertarian ideals, like nerdy stuff have been much more likely (for obvious reasons) to have found out about bitcoin early AND take serious interest. Sure there will have been people jumping on the both to make some money (on a bubble?). But my impression is that most common sense people I spoke to were very reluctant to buy them up until they understood the technology and the potential. 
I think the deflationary nature is actually a challenge. People tend to hoard their bitcoins instead of spending them.

I payed ridiculous fees for accidently going 1.5 GBP below zero BECAUSE I turned my 1000 GBP overdraft OFF, I would much rather have my card not doing any payments that make it go below zero. I only occassionally use my UK bank account when I visit friends I studied with at uni there, and got fucked over like this for buying a coffe at the airport  'oh lets see if there is still something on my card' and then forgot about it. Ended up paying 24 pounds overdraft fees for a -1.5 'unplanned overdraft balance'. I cancelled my 1000 planned overdraft because I dont use the card very often and want to prevent someone from being able to steal money from me if they steal my card. (Its a direct debet card u can use only by just putting in the numbers).

I think your reply is not addressed at me as I dont have blinders on and agree to most what you have said. I was merely pointing out it is not impossible as people have tought similar in the past and nobody anticipated the increase in the past year. I did not miss that boat and alltough I put in quite a large chunk of what I had, im not rich because I did not have much money back then due to being graduated only recently and entree level job etc... Past performance is never an indication for future returns. Dont assume everyone on here bought in just now. There are loads of people who bought in the summer when it was trading at 55 dollars. Thats half a year ago, say someone 20 coins back then (1100 dollars) if Bitcoin goes to 10 000 they would definitly be able to buy a nice car...

Well look, I work for a private trading house (option market making). The IT side of it. If trader blow their nuts (a small fraction of the companies money, not their own) or dont make enough profit they are fired. Definitly not the end of the world for them. But yes As a home trader you dont stand a chance of making money you're up against companies like us with the technology, infrastructure and know how thats worth billions. I only invest long term myself (for compliance reasons Im not allowed to buy options or daytrade stocks). But bitcoin really still lacks a big market maker, there are definitly opportunities here...

If you just bought last week you would have got them cheaper than during this 'crash'. Also if you dont believe in bitcoin enough to hold on to them during a little dip you probably shouldnt buy them in the first place.
It fucking pathetic all these crybabies around here. Bitcoin used to jump between 10 and 5 dollars! In relative movements thats a lot more dramatic and if you have half a brain you know that thats the only thing that counts. If you can choose to invest 1000 in a stock that climbs from 10 to 16 or a stock that climbs from 1000 to 1300, which one do you choose?
