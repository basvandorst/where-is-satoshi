Total BTC in circulation: 12,448,755 Ƀ
Total BTC lost by Mt.Gox: ~744,000 Ƀ 
That's less than 6% of the total BTC in circulation or ~ 3.5% of the total number (21M).
It will be always someone (or a group of people) who could possibly affect the market the same way…

If you buy something that is worth $800 USD and pay 1 BTC for it, it is just OK. 
Bitcoin is a medium of exchange but currently treated as an investment, that's why you are confused!
