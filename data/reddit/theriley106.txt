Iirc their most recent post said this.

What do you mean?  The coins?  Yes they can be tracked - it's going to be somewhat difficult for the hacker to spend the tainted coins.

Why are you even on if you don't memorize the price chart values in hourly increments?

I analyzed the sentiment of 73,579 comments containing references to Bitcoin.  The Y axis represents Polarity, which is the calculation of how negative or positive a comment is.  The scale is (-1.0 =&gt; +1.0), with -1 being the most negativity, 0 being neutral, and 1 being positive.
If anyone is interested in the data behind the visualization, check out the repo on [Github here](
Data was grabbed from the [Reddit Bigquery Dataset]( published by The query used to filter the dataset:
    SELECT
        body, created_utc
    FROM [fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.all]
    WHERE subreddit = "AskReddit" AND LOWER(body) LIKE LOWER('%BITCOIN%')
And [here is a link to the raw data]( [16.9mb]
Python was used for filtering the dataset, sentiment analysis, and converting the UTC timestamp to %m-%Y.
I used Chart.js for the visualization.
I'm curious to see how data like this compares for other *smaller* Cryptoccurrencies.  I would imagine sentiment would suddenly increase if a Crypto was being pumped, and I'm sure you could base a trading strategy purely on sentiment for smaller cryptos.
Bitcoin's infancy resulted in the volatility in 2010.  The data size was much smaller compared to Post-2013.

I honestly don't agree with that.
For instance, the user with the Highest comment Karma is/should be considered more "Loyal" than a random user with 20,000+ karma.  
Saying that though, I also don't think a user with 12 Karma with an 8 year old account should get more than a 2 year old user with 20,000+.
I have no idea how they will set it up, but I'm definitely excited.

Thank you!

Do you really think they would set it up like that?
Maybe they would have an online wallet, where like one Karma point=1 Redditcoin (Or whatever).  I really hope 1 Redditcoin won't equal 1 Satoshi.  That would be almost $.40 per 100,000 Karma.

Yes, I actually did.  It took a few days, but eventually their CS department emailed me back.

hodl some

I may get downvoted for this, but in many parts of the US I thinks it's the same.

Holy Shit.. Bitcoiners actively soliciting and bidding to buy hyper inflated fiat currencies! Now I've seen everything.
Actually, I'd be totally in as well. Cost of shipping would dwarf the actual currency, providing he could ship it out.. 
But yeah, OP, if you can stuff a few stacks into a small package, I'd totally be in on it as well for laughs.

Me too for fun lol
 
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:40:23
was wondering if you could look into this
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:20:38
Yeah, his comment is totally bs

Because he's incredibly knowledgeable about Bitcoin?
