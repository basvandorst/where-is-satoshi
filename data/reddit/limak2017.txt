Taxes. At the end of the day it would be treated as your income. In my country you would have to pay over. 40% tax on it.

@_date: 2017-10-21 09:58:53
What you think? Can you imagine it getting that high? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:20:19
You reckon it will go down and then spike up again? No point buying at this high price then?
