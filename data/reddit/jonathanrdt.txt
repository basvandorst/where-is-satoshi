Fascinating that an open peer-to-peer protocol would be the safest foundation for a military-grade communications system. I mean of course it would be, but it's quite encouraging to see DARPA recognize this.

I'd like the think, whatever the drink. It's played out like that.

Yes. That is what they are...by definition.

Blockchains are just another way to log and audit transactions. There is nothing in their nature that favors any particular group, only their use.

The only truly secured systems are secured in the open, made secure by their very nature rather than how they are housed.

GOOD. Their ratings shouldn't be based on anything but the merits of sound strategies and consistent results.
Propping them up just encourages risky behavior and ultimately increases volatility, moving funds from tax payers and Federal debt to risk takers'. That is not how we should manage our financial system.
Bitcoin is part of the answer to the challenges, but sound regulation and good policy management is critical even with a large use of Bitcoin and blockchain contracts.

Love that response: no, we don't accept this thing that you clearly want to use, but we do accept this horrible thing that we already know you hate given your interest in using bitcoin.

That's going to be an interesting challenge of p2p apps and platform: their ability to proliferate and succeed will serve positive and nefarious ends equally.

Yeah it quickly summarizes the facts and benefits in an accessible way.
Some of the explanation has awkward rhythms and phrasing, but overall high quality work.

You can have all the access to my phone you want. It won't ever tell you my *n* word passphrase, and you don't have enough computing power to brute force it, even if you know the address.
It's *way better* than a swiss bank account: it's a bearer bond that exists *only* in my head.

Cash has a negative yield due to inflation, which is built into the fabric or our monetary system.
You must earn interest to maintain zero yield. Cash on hand is worth less in time.

I got a call from a lawyer that a company I invested in years ago was acquired, and the net would be about that amount. Can confirm: was a great day.

I would expect all kinds of agencies and contractors and researchers were documenting the silk road: it was a fascinating first and worthy of study, represented a shift in power, an evasion of law, and a functioning system of trust with no central authority.

These are such classic stages of new technology acceptance by those affected: deny, condemn, acknowledge, explore, experiment, adopt, endorse.
Most folks seems to be somewhere between condemn and explore.

His is a clear statement of ignorance, and he should know better.
The range of knowledge and understanding between mature policy makers and new technology is often vast, and we've been in an era of innovation and disruption for a solid twenty years. It's hard enough for even the brightest and interested to keep up.
That said, there is still no need for anyone to 'imagine' anything: go get educated and understand the thing, you dopey admin.

Not to be picky, but legit jobs pay with dollars, and those get direct deposited in banks, oft times without an alternative.
The bank is still a policy mandated intermediary, which means folks will, at least for the time being, need a low cost dollar delivery medium. Enter: credit unions for some time yet.

Clickbait headline, inaccurate.
They're talking about using a blockchain to track gpa and other earned credentials, which is a fine use of a blockchain.
This has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Businesses still need banks.
What banks need is a faster, safe way to move money among themselves; enter: blockchain.
This is simple, evolutionary adaptation on their part. Regulations will keep banks in business for many years yet, and it will the be little and unstable countries with a lack of regulation who prove the blockchain model for corporate ownership and financing.

I dunno...if it really were negligible, many might prefer it.
I don't want to deny web operators revenue, but I refuse to see advertising. I don't buy magazines or watch regular broadcast TV because I find the ads repugnant, but if there were a way to pay with micropayments for an ad free experience, I would certainly explore it.

And a way to reduce the risk of volatility. Cash accounts are great for liquid funds because they are extremely stable.

It's such ignorant posturing. I really don't get it.
Strong (read: effectively unbreakable) encryption is required for all modern applications and the future of all communications.
It's just the way our systems of contracts and exchanges are going to work.
