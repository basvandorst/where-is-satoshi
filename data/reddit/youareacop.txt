People that deserve to get caught by not researching how to obfuscate the origin of their coins.
To the "criminals" of the Bitcoin world: Take a few days and LEARN wtf you're doing. Becoming anonymous is quite straight forward.
Keep the cats well fed with dumb mice, I say.

What about those of us that would NEVER USE social media like LinkedIn, Facebook?
Ya know, those of us that see the OBVIOUS long term drawbacks to posting your entire life online?
There is a reason that intelligence agencies bar their employees for using these services. YOU GIVE SO MUCH MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU REALIZE.
"I have nothing to hide!!"
"But I only share with FRIENDS!!"
"I only use it to play games!"
Yeah...keep telling yourselves that.
Some young people are going to be seriously regretful in a few years. Those of you that GREW UP with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts built in and see it as a standard operating procedure.
"What's the big deal?!?!?"
You'll see, young grasshopper. You'll see..

There is a problem with this viewpoint...and it's simple.
**Cops back up each others bullshit.**
Nearly ALL cops will turn a blind eye to something that is going on in their department, or something messed up they see another cop do.
If I'm an Elementary School teacher and I have a student that keeps coming into class all bruised, and I say and do nothing, I am **just as morally culpable as the person that's abusing the child.**
Apply this to cops that do some *really* fucked up shit only to have their fellow officers stand idly by.
Bullets for all of them, I say.

In certain areas of the country, yes...yes it is.
