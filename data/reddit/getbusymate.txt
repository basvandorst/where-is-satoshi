Ok well the guy that created Wordpress changed the world with a free product and now makes a living from providing value added services.
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:53:37
What is in it for the developers? Will they start selling ads? Rely on donations or what?
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:28:47
Sell them now and have to buy them in the future when the price is lower?
@_date: 2013-07-02 05:42:59
Oh yeah, I messed up. What I meant was that the price in USD is inflated but you are correct, deflation would mean 1 BTC has more purchasing power so I would need less of them to exchange the BTC for something else. Deflating BTC and inflating the amount of things I can own by exchanging my BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-02 09:31:00
How is it more useful as a currency? If it is collected and stored, not spent, isn't it less useful as an actual currency?
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:51:37
Ok, thanks. So, can I send to one address more than one time? Or is it single use? Can I store the back-up online? Also I use OSX so I should be ok for antivirus, right?

The price of is probably pegged to the USD so it will cost 2.10 btc when the price drops to $50. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 13:19:28
$99 per Bitcoin. That's cheap. And Paypal payments accepted for Bitcoins! Wow! :-P
@_date: 2013-07-13 11:28:58
Explanation, please.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:00:56
Then it is not the same. I buy the BTC for $100 and sell for the equivalent of the black market price... free money. Regarding currency, I am just a tourist, I am rich and I don't know about the currency restrictions... I just want to bang Argentinian girls.
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:58:13
In Argentine, face to face, using LocalBitcoins and receiving Argentine Pesos as payment.
@_date: 2013-07-02 05:21:27
@_date: 2013-08-02 05:09:51
I have 19.3378 BTC that I bought a month ago. I am up a little amount but I would love some BTC tips to get me to the rounds number of 20 BTC. It is too hard to remember all the decimals when I work out my current BTC values! Thanks for the giveaway, BTW.
@_date: 2013-07-20 12:33:18
Prices are higher than the coinjar.io buy price and lower than coinjar.io sell price.
@_date: 2013-07-18 03:11:20
I get more Argentine Pesos by selling my Bitcoins than I would just doing an exchange from USD to Argentine Pesos.
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:01:40
So they have a Bitcoin and they have silver. Do the coins cost = current BTC price + current silver price for that weight in silver?
@_date: 2013-07-02 09:54:45
Well as long as the stable price is a lot higher than the current price, since less BTC's are on the market.
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:58:57
It is worth anywhere near that much?
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:41:46
Just cash in my luggage. Only need 10K USD or so. I can hide that on my person somehow. What is the price difference between USD price and Argentine price currently?
@_date: 2013-07-03 14:23:39
So, I just bought some for the first time ever. I missed the boom. I have already lost money (5%). Will the price go up again?
@_date: 2013-07-17 09:19:43
No, what's the punishment for bring USD to Argentina? Can't I just spray the cash with perfume or something? It's only paper, not drugs!
@_date: 2013-07-14 19:23:44
They probably use Wordpress and got hacked. Happened to me, too.
@_date: 2013-07-04 05:54:28
What about electrum.org/ ?
@_date: 2013-07-15 14:02:16
So I would take 50% of the winners money or you pay 50% on top of what the winner gets?
@_date: 2013-07-29 17:21:01
SO BTC price to go up by alot of what?
@_date: 2013-08-02 13:42:21
What will you use the API for? Using your own software/script to update the prices on Crypto.st?
@_date: 2013-07-02 05:44:57
How? Management fee? I guess if they convince bankers to buy millions of dollars worth of BTC and then BTC falls off the face of the earth it means the twins will have a hard time ever getting money or running a venture in the future. So, their reputation is on the line I think. They might actually care about BTC afterall.
Do we know if the bankers will take the bait?
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:28:26
How do you short Bitcoin? No details on the site.
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:13:16
So, the price will go up when these issues are dealt with?
@_date: 2013-07-13 17:28:26
And make it less likely that a competing currency can take bitcoins place, right?
@_date: 2013-08-02 04:54:45
1,000 BTC coin? How much did it cost at the time?
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:38:06
Berlin gets all of the cool logos! The walking man, the Berlin bear and now this. Lucky c*nts.
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:14:35
To one of the addresses that Electrum generated? It gave me 5. Is it one use per address?
@_date: 2013-07-04 05:43:46
I bought some BTC from them. The BTC are in an account with CoinJar. Can I move them to somewhere else just incase?
Coinjar Pty Ltd is a corporation with directors in Australia and the company has to comply with Australian corporations law. So, we have some recourse.
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:04:49
But after that it will make the price increase because people can speculate and will stop sitting on the sidelines?
@_date: 2013-07-02 05:39:45
Yes but there successful venture will be offloading their Bitcoins. After that they probably won't care about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-16 12:25:24
Oh no, one those high PR blog networks? Do you offer a service to anyone or is it just local SEO clients?
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:13:34
Irrational Bitcoin owners?!
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:31:01
I saw this but I am not sure what a BTC faucet is? Do you give away BTC's and what is the reason? Do the BTC's come from your own wallet?
@_date: 2013-07-18 13:18:33
I do that too. But I could use my AUS coinjar.io account to get the AUD/USD price at say $100 and sell for Argentine Peso amount which is $160 AUS/USD when converted on blackmarket. So, my trip is 60% cheaper.
@_date: 2013-07-18 05:21:04
So people giveaway their own BTC or they get people to click on ads or something?
@_date: 2013-07-29 08:47:08
In Australia it is actually easy to buy Bitcoins now thanks to CoinJar.io but they only use the Mt Gox price and then AUD/USD exchange rate to get the AUD BTC price.
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:13:20
So its for vanity? Or will it be collectable?
@_date: 2013-07-05 04:54:33
Was just posting this. Looks like you beat me to it. Is the selling price determined by Coinjar or is it the Mt Gox price or what?
@_date: 2013-07-18 05:28:58
Try out what? BTC ownership?
@_date: 2013-08-02 16:56:59
How many BTCs per day can one of these USB sticks mine if it is operating 24/7?
@_date: 2013-08-02 09:45:45


Per BTC I am assuming. So $4 x 1000 = $4,000 and at the height they would have been worth $256,000! I would lose sleep too.
@_date: 2013-07-01 11:44:17
I am in Thailand but my SMS did not send. Any other way to get some BTC? I am in Chiang Mai.
@_date: 2013-07-18 11:38:02
September... got it. Time to make some money and then buy up the $50 BTCs!
@_date: 2013-07-04 05:33:42
If Mt Gox does USD withdrawals again does that mean the price will fall even quicker?
@_date: 2013-07-02 05:28:21
Limited supply would mean that the value of each BTC increases, known as inflation, correct?
@_date: 2013-07-02 05:23:54
No it isn't. It is the death of Bitcoin. These guys wanted to pump up the price and then cash out. The price is declining, they can't offload all of their BTC's without destroying the price. This steady decline is far worse than the crash as no-one is waiting to come in and buy at the low price, and now these twins want out.
@_date: 2013-07-15 16:24:27
What about people from the USA that are just residence of an EU country?
@_date: 2013-07-16 05:37:53
Spam sites made for Adsense? 
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:57:35
How many BTCs have been lost (forgotten passwords, lost the file etc)? Seems like BTC is even rarier than we think.
@_date: 2013-08-02 16:49:37
Can't you just login to place a trade?
@_date: 2013-07-13 11:55:18
Why? Show your work. ;-)
@_date: 2013-07-15 15:26:47
So why wouldn't they just find the site themselves and not use my link? Then they get 100%
@_date: 2013-07-20 11:23:04
Did you meet in person? I am in Europe for a while but still have AU bank account only.
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:17:06
I didn't say I was "seeking sound financial advice" I was asking about short-term price volatility. I am holding my BTC for 3+ months.
@_date: 2013-07-13 11:42:27
Or an exchange business, eg bitcoin atm
@_date: 2013-06-29 00:34:04
If they keep making more and more, the previous coins are less rare and have less of a novelty value.
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:25:39
So if I want to live in Argentina for a while could I just buy 100 BTC in USD from Mt Gox and then sell my 100 BTC in Argentina using LocalBitcoins to make a profit? I could also bring in some fiat (USD and Euros, right?)
@_date: 2013-07-18 11:18:34
Way up? Dec 31st 2013 closing price please.
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:31:52
Awesome. I got killed by the Pandas and Penguins over the last past year or so, any advice for someone about to start fresh with a domain from Namecheap bought with BTC?!
