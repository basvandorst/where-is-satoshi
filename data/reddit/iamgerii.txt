LTC has actually grown much more than bitcoin has this year.

Russian collusion in our democracy is very much a real thing and very much an important thing. I don't know what poll you're referring to but I know more than 6% of Americans care if the president or his people sold out democracy for personal gain.

Those are exchanges where buys and sells are happening within an environment. You do not exactly "buy" coins immediately, the exchange is essentially giving you an IOU for when you go to move the quantity you bought off the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:20:42
No one can tell you how comfortable your financial situation is for a move like this. This is all up to you and your wife.

What exchange do you use? I have no transfer fees from Gemini.com when sending to my cold wallet.

As others said, feather your investment during dips and times to satisfy your buying cravings. Buy some Ethereum or LTC too just to diversify.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:17:06
Bitcoin grew 1000% in 2017. So if you bought $100 in the beginning of 2017 you would have 1000% more than you did. It is estimated that bitcoin is not even close to its potential real value, so many more 1000%s are to come.
Buy, HODL. That is all.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:20:31
HODL is a meme. Someone a long time ago meant to write "hold" and misspelt it, the community now refers to holding on to coins no matter what (do no sell them in panic) as "hodl".
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:53:40
This cannot be an excuse though. How are they not prepared for this activity by now? They seem to really be messing up lately.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:05:03
Good question, I would also like to know.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:42:27
And I didn't say that is not a serious issue either.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:19:05
You will soon learn that patterns occur in crypto markets until they don't anymore. I hope that makes sense.
The fall in ETH and LTC, in my opinion, was people pulling out of those to invest in more bitcoin during the dip. So are they tied? Maybe. Ethereum is still a baby but a lot of tech is being built on it so it will eventually form its own base and not be so influenced by BTC, if it even is.
LTC is a different story since it pairs with BTC so yeah. But what you should look at are the alt coins, when BTC dipped hard the other day a lot of alt-coins were unaffected, those are the coins you want to diversify in to, in my opinion.

You can read about private keys [here at this wiki.](

BTC can relax after the month we had.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:32
Mine too, Just dropped ~$100. It will come back :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:11:27
1: Every wallet that is made contains a pair of private keys, these are unique to the wallet's addresses and are needed to be able to "spend" the crypto.
2: No. Store your coins in a cold wallet on a computer or for the most security store them on a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:26:35
Did wonders for my LTC and ETH trading.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:26:25
I do not own a Ledger Nano S (yet) so I do not know the answer specifically. I do know that the Ledger Nano S has dedicated companion apps for BTC and LTC respectively.

Is there a tut for getting that UI on the LCD?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:45:36
I want this question answered too. The video makes it seem like we, as a user, have to make a series of initial steps to even begin a transaction.
@_date: 2018-09-21 00:52:17
This is just a Lightning node or is this also a full bitcoin node, too?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:57:45
It is only BTC as of now. Anyone know when they will bring in other currencies?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:40:28
Hopefully I can say this in the next 2-3 years from my 2017 investments!
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:10:00
Thank you! I'll look into those coins and diversify!.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:46:13
My thoughts exactly. What are the start-up costs for a gold mine? What are the start-up costs for a bitcoin miner? What the fuck is this guy even talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:26:43
Same exact thing happened to me. They finally deposited it today, when growth was already over 10%.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:56:03
What does this mean for us right now? Should we get in as much as we can before December?

His name is Milton, if you screw it up again he will put strychnine in your guacamole. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:42:21
Yeah, no problem.
If you are looking to trade it then just move it to GDAX. After that, buy your coins on Gemini from here on out and transfer it to your wallet or an exchange from there. There will be tx costs for the exchange, but you wont be getting double fee'd like you will on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:00:05
That is a really good idea, but I imagine you can only really get gains by doing it with a lot of money, no? My ~$500 into BTC wont really work doing this. The tx costs will eat any gains I get.

Install Ubuntu on a partition and only conduct crypto stuff there. Saves you $50 and it is pretty secure.

I thought I made a great trade buying at 95 and was waiting for the rise then it was just free falling 2 minutes after.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:49:30
What do you do when you have bought low, sold at +75 but the price continues to rise and not return to sub-sold-price? Do you just have to buy in again once it settles at the ATH?

Got a place to start? I've been investing into Litecoin and mining Monero, but I would like to find 2 - 4 other alts to invest in early.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:02:10
Ahhhh! Good call taking the interest and buying alt coin with it. I started doing that, but because I have so little BTC I've just been buying more of it on the dips hoping one day I'll have actual returns to invest with.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:01:07
What is the difference of a hardware wallet and having your cold wallet stored on several sources, e.g. two laptops and a cellphone?
Seems to me having the hardware wallet means it could get lost and then everything is gone?

I came in this morning to read some discussion and news but every post is a stupid car meme thing.
How can I already miss the days when I first arrived and there were serious discussions and I was learning new stuff every minute, when those days were just over a week ago.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:26:51
I'm just as new as you! I started into bitcoin maybe a little over a week ago. I just binge researched and did some trial and error. Happy to share what I've learned.

gdax down. bitstamp down...

Current forms of retirement are all speculation too. What was wiped out during the 2008 crash? Everyone's 401ks and retirement plans. So you can gamble your retirement with the banks or with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:01:23
Yes, sorry. I meant Google Voice. I used it when I was in Thailand and I needed to call my bank. IIRC 1-800 numbers were free to call using it.

Yeah, that person was putting it up in SF.

I've been on the same dock since Thursday morning. Maybe another boat will come?

I see. So why not just write it down and store that somewhere safe?

How do you monitor the activity in China or is it all the same on GDAX? (Sorry, I'm new).

Google Phone!

@_date: 2017-11-13 13:17:45
This has been me since Thursday morning. I'm very salty right now with this new rise.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:07:00
Yeah, I talked to my finance friend just a week ago and he says that I am, "buying into the hype too much." The 7 years of growth hype?
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:38:52
What are some of your techniques?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:46:20
My graduate professor just told a story about when she was working in the UN and they started to use email. She thought it completely unnecessary and that the post box was perfectly fine.
The times get ahead of most people.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:45:34
Because they don't have one.

Well what is it? Is Jihan in the pocket of the Chinese government or not? If he was affected by a crackdown then that sort of distorts the ongoing conspiracy theory about him and Bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:57:58
I was going to buy $100 of bitcoin this morning on Coinbase with a $2 fee to do so. Gemini had a $0.13 fee. On top of that, you are cleared to use $500 immediately from your bank on Gemini instead of waiting 5+ days for a bank transfer (like I did during the dip and subsequent rise of btc, missing out) on Coinbase.
I haven't needed Gemini's costumer service, but from what I hear it is very good. Coinbase's is shit. I emailed them a week ago and no follow up.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:38:49
Depends what you want to do. I send all my BTC to my cold wallet (Electrum). I do not trade it, just hodl. So it is pretty easy to send from Coinbase to your wallet, just withdraw it to your wallet's address. But if you try to send it from Coinbase to Gemini you will get a pretty heavy transfer fee (they don't want to lose coins to another exchange).
I would send it to GDAX (free) then move it to your wallet (also free) from GDAX. When you want to spend it you can send it to whatever exchange you want (though there will be a tx cost).
Sooooo, it depends what you want to do with your BTC.
Keeping it on any exchange is not a good move as they can go under any day, get hacked, and you will lose your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:31:57
Can you explain your investing strategy re: compounding? Do you cash out the earnings at a specific % and then rebuy then? Wait and rebuy? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:24:07
Coinbase was an entry to bitcoin for me, as I suspect it is (and was) for many people. It took less than a week for me to to despise them, pack up and move to bitstamp + gemini. Not looking back!
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:53:14
They are one of the biggest USD counterfeiters in the world. They have a whole area setup for printing money.

$9,940 is not $9,000.
Calm down.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:58:15
Is it better to wait for after February when Coinbase implements segwit? Wouldn't the fees be lower then?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:36:20
How can they rebuy if they have lost all their money?
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:59:53
I don't have to assume that you triple speak.
