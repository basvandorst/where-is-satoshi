every single one of my big losses was actually a gain to the IRS. The BTC I spent on SC for instance, could be worth like 20k USD, but instead is like 1k USD. When using Bitcoin.tax, I technically made a gain of like 200$. Its absolutely brutal out there.

If you have the funds Id suggest a hardware wallet. Im a casual hodler and find that its the easiest and safest way for me to casually buy bitcoin biweekly and make deposits.

Thats what Im going to switch to doing. The fees and the fact that I can buy when its a bit lower probably add up over time.

I use the autobuy, am interested in reducing fees. Care to help a brother out and explain what you mean and how you would auto buy btc?

If you dont want to explain you dont have to but Im curious what you mean by that. Im looking for a Roth IRA at the moment and seeing ROTH IRA in a btc forum has me interested.

Im such a god damn noob. Ive just been using coinbase to buy like 40$ worth bi weekly. I could be getting more bang for my buck if i wasnt lazy. Story of my life. So you would just manually buy 40$ worth biweekly through an exchange then send money to a wallet? The auto buy is just such a nice way to sit back and forget about prices, highs and lows and the shitstorm we are in.

I really appreciate you taking the time to explain. Currently putting 12% of my check in my companies 401k, Im about to open a ROTH and max out the 2016 contribution. Still have to research and learn about what ROTH to get into or how. Im a moron and thought this ETF would have some ROTH account but you cleared that up for me. Then I round down my checks and use that money to buy 34$ of btc per check and 10$ per check towards Ethereum. I manually buy Dash using Coinbase--&gt;Shapeshift.io--&gt;on to my Ledger Nano S.

Oh the gambling part. Yea I can see that.

Im so confused. What are you talking about? Why shouldnt he be buying bitcoin? Why WILL coinbase cancel his account for buying .88 btc? Care to explain a bit?
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:57:44
I dont see that as a negative. They are a UK exchange and you bought coin using a bank account.... the standard banking times should apply, you are wiring money from the US to the UK. Buy with a debit card if you want it instantly. Just another reason coinbase is nice IMO

this gave me anxiety and im not OP

Im a nub but I personally use Coinbase to buy btc then I send some spending coin to my Mycelium wallet and the rest I dump into my Ledger. Im on android but Ive had no issues with Mycelium

I've just been having doubts about the scaling of it. From my semi informed perspective it just seems like if we are already facing these scaling issues when its so fringe, how could it possibly handle a influx of users or mainstream adoption. I almost feel like I want to put my soap box preaching of btc on hold till some of this is sorted out.

Yea ive been thinking that too. Might bump it to like 4.20%... something cheeky 
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:47:53
LMFAO was confused as to why you felt it was a small amount compared to my income.... Im not pulling in 10,000 bi weekly, move the decimal place, woops. So 25$ out of 1000 biweekly really doesn't effect me at all financially or mentally. I went into this knowing theres a chance il lose everything I put in either through ignorance, the market or hacking. If I stomached and continue to stomach the crazy amount of money ive spent on dumb shit then I can justify losing X amount in something I am passionate about.

ones 130 and ones 190. Thanks for the info I have them pulled up on blockchain.info and am refreshing the page every minute. I mainly was wondering if im supposed to wait days or hours. My first transactions with btc were pretty much instant and I've only read about peoples transactions taking hours or days to complete.... this is my first run in with over an hour wait... its already been about 3-4 hours.
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:40:22
Il have to do that until this gets figured out. Its too nerve wracking having $500 out in no mans land for hours at a time. Wanted to diversify a bit more and buy some litecoin and ripple, my crypto banking should be faster than conventional banking but now im waiting hours for one transaction to go through.

The fact that your worried enough to come here for validation is enough for me to know you need to just hodl that shit for a while. If it means anything, I bought at an ATH ($1250) before the ETF decision. It crashed to $900, I wrote that off as my first loss and stopped checking the prices as it was becoming cancerous. If I had made this same post back then. Somebody would have given me this answer then too. Dont trip.

Block chain is the tech behind bitcoin. Coinbase and Gemini are both places you can buy bitcoin. People are shitting on coinbase because they tend to go down when people need it most. When people are panic buying and selling like today. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:33:08
meh if you see it on the block chain I would just wait.

I gauge volatility by the status of coinbase. If coinbase is down? We are having a volatile day. Their inconsistency to handle volume is their most consistent trait.
