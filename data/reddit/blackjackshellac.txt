This is a fair point. Fiat currency only works, fundamentally, if you trust the government to have competant economists and not to act in bad faith. If you can't do that, I understand the appeal of a commodity currency.
I guess my only critique would be, at that point why have government at all? If you think they're THAT corrupt or incompetant, why not go for a commune?

Yeah, but a deflationary monetary system (btc) has less incentive for investment to drive efficiencies and bring prices down than an inflationary monetary system (fiat). You can't complain about this system being broken then propose something which makes that problem worse. There are many advantages to bitcoin (decentralized, anti-state, anti-bank, digital, popular/$valuable$ right now, etc.) but one of them is not increasing consumer purchasing power. Consumers do well when they have high enough wages to purchase goods and companies do not sit on their money or stash it away.

Sure, I've heard this response. The classic counter to this is to ask a question: In what scenario does the United States government have a debt crisis where businesses and other international institutions threaten not to use the dollar and are able to follow up on that threat?
It's exceedingly difficult to imagine without a number of other unrelated catastrophic economic events happening. The example a lot of people cite of a catastrophic debt/GDP ratio is Japan. Bets against Japan on this ground have been so wrong they're known as "widowmakers" as in you lose all your money. Until this begins to change there is strong evidence in our current scenarios that outweighs historical precedent.

Small, self-sufficient communities are not exclusive of UBI. We can have both.

Did you attend Loyola of New Orleans or George Mason? Those are the only two universities I'm aware of with economics professors THAT libertarian.

How does this chart factor in to the 51% attack discussion? I'm struggling to understand.

I'd love to read about this 93% success rate. Do you have any literature I can peruse?

This is really cool! Thanks

Sure, but it's worth it.

Get your CPAs and attorneys now folks. It looks a lot better to the court that you're handling it proactively rather than scrambling when they find you.

You're making an investment, the government taxes investments. The government can't tax you if they can't see what investments you're making.

That doesn't matter, it's the law. We're not talking about morality. The IRS took out Al Capone, what makes you think Bitcoin is any different?

What due process issues are implicated here? You have a legal obligation to pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:06:36
This is something a tax attorney and CPA can help you with. These are complicated legal questions, some of which might be worth fighting in the courts. You need help though.

Oooh 3edgy5me, comparing taxes to rape. I'm convinced, those situations are so similar I'm rethinking my whole life now.

Mycelium is very secure, but unless you are very good at remembering passwords and never lose them I would use something else.

Patently false. On average, people with university degrees make more money than those who do not.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:27:20
No, as in TODAY if you compare the average income of somebody with a college degree and the average income of somebody without a college degree the person with the degree makes more.
Please read up, you are woefully misinformed of basic economic data. The gap between college graduates and those who have not graduated college is WIDENING, not closing. 
Those numbers reflect post-tax earnings, which take into account monthly payments on student debt.

None of us bought at zero, but as long as there are people who want to use it it will have some value.

It's not going to stabilize any time soon. It's going to shoot up and down until it becomes costly for traders to speculate with this.
