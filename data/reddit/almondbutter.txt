That is where you are completely wrong. Absolutely this person who supposedly had the "epic takedown" that is voted to the top is a major advocate for these banking cartels that continuously perpetrate fraud. I agree that bitcoin is shit for facilitating ideal exchanges, (high fees, slow tx times) just keep in mind this is because of the greedy, obscenely wealthy mining factions. 
The funny thing people are neglecting to mention is that there are dozens of other crypto assets that are light years ahead of bitcoin in these regards. Since bitcoin has the other crypto assets held hostage, people see bitcoin as the "ideal" asset in this space. Don't be fooled into thinking these clowns trumpeting the corporate line aren't benefiting obscenely from this horrendously broken system. For instance, did you know that even though the bank HSBC was cleared of wrong doing, even though anyone with a brain in their head knows that these people are vile monsters who supported and actively trafficked millions of dollars from the [worst dictators and drug cartels in the world?]( Cleared as in they paid an outrageously low "fine" and now get to carry on as if they never did anything bad. This system needs to change and the elites are fighting tooth and nail to continue this blatant pillage of the lower classes and anyone who stands up for the banks is either ignorant to the perennial abuses or they are a vile corporate lackey like the current head of the FCC.

Apologies for going off, but I disagree with the above statement. 
Yes they are arguing with that. These people are disguising legitimate critiques of bitcoin as ammunition to glorify our disgraceful banking system.

Buddy, you can download free wallet software online and simply transfer your coins there. You need to write down the 12 word pass phrase and then in the event you lost your laptop (or other computer) you could simply redownload that software on another computer and use your pass phrase to recover.

...And the value of bitcoin cash has doubled since you sold.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:57:22
That's just it, I have both bitcoin and bitcoin cash from the fork. I am happy to see both of them rise. Why on earth are you mad when bitcoin cash rises? It's ridiculous. If you just held it you would be fine. If you didn't buy any bitcoin until after the fork, well then you need to realize you can't lose something you never had.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:29:09
All of the engineers and computer scientists working on blockchain projects clearly have no idea what they are doing. /s

Well, the Gemini exchange and Coinbase were in on this, so in the US, it's really hard to get into crypto without these. The immoral jackals are basically saying, "if you don't like it, too damn bad."

Basically they rode the wave by making people believe that the fork was definitely happening, then they made a decision not to, told their friends , sold off their bitcoin and then gained obscene profits. So yeah there's that. I believe in block chain although I barely have any in bitcoin, it's just too shady and I don't care if I don't see a %2300 gain. Someone needs to be held accountable and right now, alts are straight up slaves because at any point, people who have *nothing* to do with bitcoin aside from being major holders, get to say, hey we're having another fork! Free money. I won't buy into it anymore. I have both a bit of bitcoin and bitcoin cash from the fork, onto much more ethical projects with real people working on them. Case in point, does anyone even know who did the bitcoin gold fork? That is my point, shady as hell. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:42:52
I dropped most of my bitcoin. I am so sick of the greed and corruption. Anyone who is reading this, think about it. Everyone was punished for not having bitcoin when they announced the fork. This whole YES FORK FREE MONEY, NO FORK NVM, YES FORK was the already obscenely wealthy knowing all of this ahead of time and using it to their advantage to enrich their friends and to cheat alt coin holders... Of course they are going to pull this again in the future. 
Look at Ethereum. Like him or not, you have Vitalik who is vital to the project. Imagine if he pulled this? People would be so mad. His is the "face" of Ethereum. Who is this for bitcoin? The enigmatic "Satoshi?" As shady as they want to be, we simply are not allowed to know who pulled this stunt, whether it truly was known by who ahead of time, anyway you look at it, it was immoral and shady. It all becomes a blame game of animosity and unnecessary manipulation. I am here to invest in the tech, that's why I'm moving on, be damned if I don't make %3400 profits. As long as we continue to buy into this, nothing will change.

I wonder if this comment will be removed for simply saying, good point you have there. There are dozens of far more valuable crypto assets out there.

Care to guess how many automated scripts are buying and shorting continuously 24-7? Probably more than the entire number of people who own bitcoin.

Still, it would be quite nice to be able to go buy a nice house anywhere in Austin, San Fran or NYC.

You should contact the group that wrote the wallet software to find out their policy on Bitcoin cash. It was different for every wallet. Also, consider a fork as an update to software. You're prompted to download the latest software that you have on your computer. This is similar, it's just that the developers handle it, and it is usually meant to improve the technology. Another two forks are upcoming, and to know how your wallet will relinquish the new bitcoin gold for instance, you simply have to check with them. I had my bitcoin in a jaxx wallet during the Bitcoin cash fork, and they are just now about to release it from what they say on the latest blog post.

Not yet, most likely will be solidified in the next couple weeks, just thought it'd be good to get people thinking about it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:59:05
I will pop out just before the fork actually to have a jump start on the alts.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:32:02
Do not believe anything you read, do your own research. That being said, here is a link to consider. Apparently most of this bitcoin gold has been premined.

I never said to run software from them, I was merely comparing what the developers are doing to bitcoin to what developers do to upgrade software that runs on your computer. Obviously no software is necessary merely to possess bitcoin, other than perhaps a software wallet to store it in.

A friend of mine put upwards of 4 grand into bitcoin back when it was around 120. He "lost" everything when Mt. Gox crashed. I always hoped someone would come through with a way to retrieve that money, though I don't expect he will ever see it again.

Actually Comcast seems to be nowhere to be found in upstate. We have all been under Time Warner Cable though they recently conglomerated into Spectrum. I sure hope spectrum is not Comcast. To clarify, Binghamton, Oneonta, Rochester, Syracuse I believe are all TWC Spectrum.
