Shouldn't China be a strobe light?

Why are we trippin' about Buffet's opinion of crypto? 
No, the man probably doesnt understand even the tip of the iceberg in how all this stuff works, that doesnt mean every thing else he says financially should be thrown out the window, or vice versa. I think a big problem that folks like Buffet see is people investing in crypto as an idea of passive income or financial freedom. When they get burned, people like Buffet see that and note that versus a traditional investment, this would've never happened.

No one should watch these crappy snapchat news posts, but I happened to see the headline was "Bitcoin Cash Down 90%", so I guess they got me there. 
I really dont like to make a conversation about something like this, I dont think its necessary on reddit anymore. But I'm glad that a sort of mainstream outlet is at least trying to present some if any facts.

Thats modern day, digital journalism for ya. Write for the masses. Make it simple enough for them to understand. Cover popular/trendy topics.

Actually, the unit of Bitcoin is bitcoin (little b).
....At least I think...
 so I dunno man I read this shit somewhere now it's my time to shine

Nice. Thank you for the explanation about nodes. The difference between miners/hash power and nodes is now very clear to me. 
I think it is a shame that we dont have any better solutions yet to the scaling issues Bitcoin has and will surely come to face. But am hopeful that with time, more solutions will arise.

I agree decentralization is an absolute priority.
I will look into how less nodes have affected ETH. 
I just feel like what happened in December was awful and said a lot about using BTC widely as a large wave of adoption isnt likely to occur with those insane fees.

So the larger the block size, the more expensive it is to run a node. And as a result, smaller node operations drop out, leaving only bigger prof. nodes running, thus  creating more centralization?
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:36:15
Hmm. Some people who've posted here seem to claim or think otherwise. 
One of the comments mention that if a mine farm gained that &gt;50% hash power and could double spend, they'd effectively commit suicide on both their own business and Bitcoin in general. Though this offers me little to no comfort, it does make an argument for being OK with large farms, and supports limiting block size for larger # of nodes.

In this so called balance you mention of those who can hoard and those who can't, where does this sounds like a good idea? Isn't that exactly rich get richer poor get poorer thinking?
We dont want a few taking the most, and we certainly dont want those few with the most messing with the spending power of the currency that I depend and work to receive.

No wealthy smart person simply has $1mil cash in the bank just hanging out in a bank account or something. Most millionaires don't have even close to 1mil in liquid cash. Their money is tied up in different investments, most commonly, Real Estate and something to do with the Stock Market. So if I have a home valued at $1m in 2000, then keeping with your rate of inflation of 3% until 2025, the home should be worth 2.1m, Still owning 20,000 hours of labour @ $100/h.
TLDR: Nobody hoards $1M in liquid cash, and certainly not for 25 years. If you do, you're losing large opportunity for your money to work for you.

Fair enough, I guess the circle jerking does make sense in the bigger scale of time. 
I'm well aware I'm part of a group of massive influx of users to coin/this sub, so I guess I just expected a larger mix of types of posts.
And I've checked out most of the information and the sticky'd newcomer thread, all which have been very helpful in giving me basic understand of Bitcoin and crypto in general. I guess I just need to be digging more into the rabbit hole to learn about these really niche things.
Thank you for the reply!
PS I've actually only made this account today, I'm puzzled why I have a 2 day old flair... However I have a few other accounts but I like to keep some kind of privacy between them ;)

Where do you people go to school? my four year degree is only going to come out to 22k, which grants should pay for assuming no funding is pulled and I continue to meet requirements. in-state tuition, public state university. That much extra capital would be enough to make me switch to a business major.

So will transaction fees become exponentially higher? or do they stay the same per amount of currency moved?

I don't know what I expected when I started the video. then I saw the knives and.. against my better judgement I just stuck around. why? why did anyone want to see what this man promised? is this what the human condition has come down too? sad part is I stuck around to the bitter end
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:35:51
Wow I had a really good watch on that lighting network video, as well as the other links you provided. 
To be honest, I wasn't even aware of the existence of transactions being able to be made/arranged in such a way that lets it bypass block wait times, etc. another smart innovation in crypto I guess.
This new understanding really solidifies my faith that BTC could survive in the long-long game, so thanks for the links!

How can something bounce back when it did an ATH in 2017? Or when you consider it X10 from start of 2017 to end of 2017. I guess 1 month really is a year or two in crypto land

You don't get truly amazing, juicy works of art like this too often

I don't think this post adds positive value to the subreddit
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:28:16
I feel like hes trying to incentivize the market to buy BTC, seeing as every single coin is tied to Bitcoin's price, thus raising most if not all of your shit coins :-)
