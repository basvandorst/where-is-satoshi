Thanks for letting people know I'm around. I'll get it taken care of right meow.

That is not entirely true anymore. I'm here and have made a couple posts, including when merchants bank stopped supporting deposits for us. The difference between that and this, is that our withdrawals were never affected, there's have been.

When I'm not translating our updates I'm translating for our English website which will support USD/BTC. We're working on it and should have it ready soon. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:48:41
Yeah i'll post on facebook now.  
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:41:22
Of course, that's what I'm here for :)
@_date: 2014-04-23 01:59:24
Yes, we absolutely are. We're working on it right now and will have it launched in the near future. Google Translate is absolutely horrid when it comes to translating Chinese so I completely understand where you're coming from. When we launch our English site I'll be sure to make a post here to let everyone know.

We already have a way outside of bank recharges, I'll be posting it shortly. It's recharge codes. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:07:13
I'll be providing translations for all of our news from here on out :) 
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:58:02
We didn't lose all of our bank accounts, we've lost two, Merchant Bank and China Construction Bank.

I don't know how giving correct translation of released news would make me a troll or sleezy. But, as you can see above I am who I say I am, I represent this reddit account and facebook on behalf of OKCoin. I will be providing translations for our news as well as Chinese news in general and help for anybody that needs it in regards to our services. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:12:14
That is correct.

Do you have Weibo? They're putting it up on Weibo now, but it might take until tomorrow(it's 7:30 PM) for it to go up on the main page. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:21:32
We just created the facebook page, we also just created a twitter, and we're working on an english/foreign website.

If you find a security vulnerability(those are the only ones eligible) just message me first(I'm setting up the email right now to receive the actual bugs) and the rules are, find a security vulnerability, win some btc after it's confirmed by us. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:38:54
2 banks, merchant bank and construction bank, but yeah... 
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:32:04
That's fine, better to be safe, right? They'll prolly get around to it tomorrow for the main page, but they're putting it on Weibo now. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:39:42
Okie dokes, we'll see. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:35:58
Sorry to disappoint, I have no access to the main site and most people have already left the office, like I said it's 7:35 PM here. But tomorrow we should have it up.
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:02:06

@_date: 2014-04-16 02:27:19
We are working on our english website right now and it should be finished soon. If there's anything in particular you have questions about or would like translated let me know and I'll get it done. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:03:32
