No, I'm not clicking on that and *YOU* are the problem.  People like you who spread their shit is why you have less freedom every year.  You want to end the war on cash?  Stop spreading their lies; no more links, no more clicks.  That's when we win.
They'll eventually come for bitcoin because you won't stand for the freedom of cash.  Again, there is only ONE WAY to win this war - do not ever visit the site of any mainstream media.  Cut off all their financial spigots and watch them burn.
But no, no, no; you fucktards go around spreading their bullshit fully aware that it's pure bullshit.
No upvotes and no clicks fuckass.  And to the author of that article, I'm going to love it when you watch how you get played because you're nothing short of a useful idiot for a dark agenda.  Go ahead; make your money now, but watch as it becomes irrelevant and you end up in poverty without realizing how.  Worthless fuckasses - all of you journalists.

I'll be the black sheep of the bitcoin community and say that I don't like how the community gets excited about negative interest rates helping bitcoin.  I want to win because I'm the best, not because everything else sucks.
I want bitcoin to go up against a currency with a 10% interest rate and crush it.  That's how I win.  This fantasy of "everything is going to go to Hell and bitcoin is going to rise" completely misses the point that *even if* bitcoin rises because everything sucks, everything still sucks.

This is great, but I'm confused - did the legal status of bitcoin change in Russia?  I remember discussions about changing the legal status in *foreign transactions only*, but has the Russian government finally let Russians own bitcoin?

This is a propaganda technique that works on Americans: minority groups and women get the *feelsies* in advertisements because Americans are dumb.  My favorite is how women in America - over 51% of the population - are considered a *minority*.  Luckily, since Americans are so fucking retarded at math, they think this works.

I upvoted you and I don't agree.
If you've read FA Hayek then you know why bitcoin is better than a well run central bank.  A central bank is still centralized control with a point of failure.  Even a well-run central bank cannot get around this; bitcoin is decentralized and has no single point of failure.  Bitcoin inherently helps the entrepreneur through *clear communication of its maximum supply* and through a network that provides *inherent trust through transaction verification*.  Central banks can't promise that because they still have a central point of failure and anyone who's evil could always get in and corrupt it anyway.
The takeaway here is that even a great central bank will still lose to bitcoin.

Crypto-to-crypto: no issue
I want to upload fiat (not offered right now): big issue
Governments own fiat currencies, so anyone who uses them in the long run will be required to do verification.  If this concerns you, then stick to crypto-to-crypto.

If producers aren't profitable, you won't have any.  This is true for exchanges, miners and people who develop ideas in the bitcoin space.  Without profits, these businesses are not sustainable, so how do they stay around?  Dreaming of a world where everyone offers you free stuff sounds great, except if they get nothing back, what's the incentive to just become a consumer of free stuff too?
It's like wanting doctors to give you free healthcare, and then living in a world where no one becomes a doctor because they want free healthcare too.  What's the incentive?

"Chew the meat, spit out the bones."
Bitcoin makes a great way to earn interest on savings and have a currency that is protected from inflation.  It's a tool.  Fully agree with you - bitcoin is not a company or basket of companies.

That's not how shorting works.  The shorter has to borrow shares and may be wrong.  In your example, that's a naked short - very risky.  Shorting bitcoin doesn't mean it goes down; it's betting that it *will* go down, but if it doesn't, it could be a disaster.
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:30:55
The shitwad you're responding to doesn't grasp what shorting is.  Shorting doesn't cause something to fall.  It's a risky move that expects something to fall - it could be wrong and cause a big headache.

No, shorting is not selling.  Shorting is *borrowing and selling what you've borrowed*.  A borrower does not *own* what they're selling, rather they're selling borrowed funds.  That's a huge difference; they will have to stop out of a possible loss fast because they don't own the funds and the direction could reverse terribly.  Whereas if I own something free and clear, I don't have to worry about a price jump or fall; if it falls, I can add - if it rises, I can sell.
The psychology is totally different and it does not directly cause the price to fall because the funds are *not owned outright*; they are borrowed.
Shorting has never and will never directly cause the price to fall; shorting is a borrowed bet that it will.  99% of shorter lose money and end up having to cover at a loss, which refutes your shitwad assertion that "Shorting does cause the price to fall".  You should only short with very strict stops and when you have a strong amount of evidence that a rise cannot continue.
