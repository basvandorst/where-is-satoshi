Entirely correct. And interesting undoubtedly. 
Here's wishing you a happy new year and that you get shitloads of real life karma for being able to take positive comments positively.

I'm not sure that that is an Easter Egg.

Yes, the defence against the $5 wrench.

So no one is going to donate ? Grin

Thanks. I realise that. 
See my comment to 's comment above for how I resolved this without getting my pulse racing too much.

I think that may be server side. But I could be wrong.

*You're right*
Details, you know.

Or is it as simple as following the [Change Recovery Seed]( procedure?

Its worked out pretty well.
I'm leaving this here for anyone else who has the same concerns or requirement...
Here is what I did
1. I took the trezor (which had a wallet with some coins, a pin code and no passphrase) and wiped it. I made sure that the recovery words (seeds) were available.
2. I unplugged and re-plugged the device. I set it up as a new device, with passphrase and a pin. This time I chose 24 instead of 18 recovery seeds / words.
3. I clicked on receive, copied the receiving address for this new wallet.
4. Wiped the device again.
5. Again unplugged and re-plugged in the device, chose to restore.
6. Used the recovery words (seeds) from the initial (non-passphrase protected) setup.
7. My original wallet and contents showed up. I now sent the entire balance to the new wallet (step 3) address.
8. Wiped the device, unplugged and replugged it in.
9. Recovered it using the recovery words from Step 2
10. The contents from the non-passphrase protected wallets had already been sent to the new passphrase-protected wallet.
One of the advantages that the passphrase protected wallet offers is simply this: if your device is not password protected, the contents of your wallet show up the moment you go to mytrezor.com. You only need the PIN for transactions.
So if anyone saw your trezor lying around and plugged it in, they would be able to (at the very least) see your wallet balance.
With the passphrase, the browser requires you to put it in before the wallet contents are revealed.

That's right. But with PIN alone, even clicking on forget device does not prevent the accounts from showing up directly when the device is re-plugged in.
