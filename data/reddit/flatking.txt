I have no other reason apart from taking a gamble when it was around 0.3 I’m selling it off today :)

Coinbase is GDAX
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:48:26
Can I ask what you're basing that on?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:41:13
It is much safer to store it in your own wallet than on a server/exchange like Coinbase.
There are tons of different wallets you can look into whether it's just an app, paper wallet or a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:27:11
How can't you get Verified on GDax it's just a sister company of Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:26:13
Love the look of your site, have you checked it over with accessibility standards?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:43:25
Nope, they created Gemini for big banks and big players, they don’t have anything to do with coinbase financially or in terms of ownership 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:01:59
Gemini is owned by the Winklevoss Twins and Coinbase is owned by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:01:43
Personally I store mine in a hardware wallet which makes me feel a bit safer

Ideally, only you can be your financial adviser. There's going to be a lot of price changes in the next couple of weeks with Bitcoin Futures, so holding is always a good idea.
Also if you're going to be investing a fair bit more I'd look at diversifying with altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:31:17
I'd personally choose Gemini out of those two, but there is no reason to just use a single exchange if they're almost identical
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:48:31
It depends how you look at bitcoin, you will still have x Bitcoin no matter the price so riding it out is always a good suggestion, however if you’re scared to see it move by 30% in a day I’d just watch from a far.
It’s hard to say, it depends if you buy in fiat or you buy alt coins with bitcoins. Most other altcoins don’t get affected by bitcoin news as people hardly know about altcoins.

Any amount is a good amount to start with, only "invest" what you're willing to lose
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:55:02
Yep, take some time learning about what they do and if you feel like they're worth being invested in! If you're trading in USD you've got access to a few different exchanges with easier options to different altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:47:57
I don't use any wallet apps myself I just stick to a hardware wallet. 
Anything from the legit bitcoin site would be a good idea 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:47:10
I'll send you a little message now :)

I earn a salary it's easy for the Government to know what I earn, but how would the Government know what a freelancer / contracter / shop owner etc. earns?

I hope to go into 4 figures by the end of the month so I'll be investing in a little hardware wallet for securing my investments, I'll keep my eye on gdax, thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:47:35
Have you got any advice on what hardware wallet to get? Would I purchase from coinbase and move it to my hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:30:05
I appreciate the reply, I'm just starting to get on the ladder and it's quite a steep learning curve!
Is something like [this]( a good thing to invest in?
I'm guessing the process would be buy on coinbase and move to my wallet over and over?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:39:15
I started investing just as all the Bcash bits were going on and it nearly threw me. I think just using 10% is a great idea I'll try and stick to something similar.
Do you tend to wait for a dip or just invest, as right now it's the highest it's been, would you wait or just top up the funds a little?
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:26:23
Ah right, well I'm nowhere near that yet haha. If I stay &gt; 10k - 50k would staying with Coinbase be okay, or should I look at better alternatives in the future?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:51:52
Thanks for your reply, I've only just started looking into bitcoin so I'll be investing in a hardware wallet in the next couple of months.
Why do you keep 10% on coinbase? Is it there as a "just incase"?
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:09:00
I'm very new to bitcoin - Is it good to just stick to Coinbase? I understand the fees are a bit steep but it's exceptionally easy to use.
Also is it safe to have "lots" in a coinbase wallet eg 10s of bitcoins or would that be when you move to a more private wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:48:27
For someone that's just got involved with bitcoin what does this mean? I thought this is one of the things with BCH that dropped the price a few weeks ago?
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:33:36
What is "Fiat" is it literally just physical money?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:46:48
Perfect! Thank you for bearing with me, I'm guessing selling - if I ever needed or wanted to would be the same - Send to coinbase from the usb stick and sell? I'm guessing send and sell in like 0.5 - 1 bitcoin max
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:36:53
Well sell as in get access to the money to buy say a house or pay for university, or would you wait until you buy a house with that currency?
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:35:45
That's my thoughts too, investing every payday to hopefully afford a mortgage
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:40:24
I'll definitely be investing in one in the next couple of months!
What would you suggest instead of coinbase for buying and selling? I don't see me doing it a lot tbh so I am willing to just soak up the fees a little
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:26:17
That post is a good place to start, I'm quite new to it myself I'd suggest 0.5btc max first to give yourself an idea of how everything works without risking huge amounts of money
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:05:38
Stopped following them on twitter after they kept releasing posts about how to buy Bitcoin Cash
