I have a name for this phenomenon.  I have raised all my kids on it.  I will continue to tell this family anecdote that I started noticing in my early twenties when all I wanted was to be rich or there about.
Whenever you are working around miserable people who have no real drive to get past an average life, you will always encounter a situation that sounds like this:
You (motivated person) works hard and gets a new thing:
House, car, girlfriend or boyfriend, promotion, business, or anything else that sets you apart from all the people that you know, you hear them say, "it must be nice to have that".  JEALOUSY.
I have known this since my adult children were two.
It's the crabs in a bucket syndrome.  I'm glad I noticed it way back then, because so far, half of the kids have taken it to heart.
They don't let people weigh them down any more.  If you are doing well, you should be proud and not ashamed.  
You don't let some other person drag you down.
That is the crabs in the bucket observation.
If you throw a bunch of crabs in a bucket, there will always be one that tries to crawl out.  That is right when all the others try to drag that crab back in to the bucket.
It is a metaphor for jealousy.  No one wants you to succeed more than they do. and they will drag you down to keep that from happening.
Be your own successful person and don't be one of those crabs... in the bucket.

This is funny.  I held Facebook from the IPO for 5 years and made 41% per year over that time.
I got interested in Crypto 2 years ago but didn't move on it.  Until...
maybe 6 months ago, I got fully committed.
So I sold Facebook and bought some coins.  
My wife was a little pissed about it, but it was my decision, so not that big of a deal with my marriage.
Six months later, I'm up 41% each month. Exactly.
So every time I check a price, I ask my wife if she wants that Facebook stock.

Hind sight 20/20.  None of these people ever get this.
Last week's lottery numbers?  Oh, those were mine.  I just forgot to buy the ticket.  I'd be worth $200 million dollars right now.
For every Apple, Google or whatever, there are exactly 4,367,612 opportunities. And that is 4 to 5 times a year.  In this country, not the whole world.  So good luck with those numbers.
Better yet, go to Vegas with your stack and you can double it in a minute on the roulette table.
But if you have the stones to lose it all on that 50/50 bet, you're a gambler and not an investor.
Actually,  I'm a gambler.

Ok, so this is a little off topic, but I want to throw this notion out if you have further opportunities to write other papers.  I've wondered if people have ever studied or written about Clash of Clans video game.  I've played on different devices for 5 or 6 years, so I got curious and looked in to it.  That game started with like 4 people and over six years has made 6 billion dollars.  It's crazy.  I love bit coin and the tech behind it.  I have owned a bunch of BC but do not presently. (Life).  It is very interesting but I wonder if you would also persue other stories like that one if you were assigned another open project.

Keep in mind that the option contracts have a time limit.  It's not like you just go short forever.  Your bet has to be reckoned.  And with this price volatility, that is a dangerous gamble to make.
If you go short now on a Feb futures contract for, say, one coin, and the price continues its pace to $25,000, you owe someone $8,000.
That's a big loss.  Now multiply that times however many coins it takes to make real money.
It's like the opposite of that old adage about when the market is falling and everyone is talking buying the new bargain prices.  "It's hard to know when to catch a falling knife."
In this case, shorting is the opposite of the falling knife scenario.

Your reply is not helpful to the question you were responding to.  The answer Dcarf was looking for was YES.  If you have your words, you can reclaim them on a new hardware wallet.  A new ledger will let you do that.  The same with Trezor wallet.

I'm middle aged.  And I know you didn't make the system, but I have always had a problem with this line of thinking.  I've got to live until 65 to start enjoying my money without a huge tax burden?  That bothers me.  Most of the fun part of life is over by then and money certainly doesn't matter as much at that point.
Most of my investments have done amazingly well.  Very few have been around the 7 to 10 % that we were taught were great returns.  I have also made several, maybe 5 that were complete busts.  But overall, I am way ahead.  And generally in a much smaller amount of time.
I used to want someone to give me a road map to being rich enough not to worry about money.  But after all this time on the planet, I know that there are no people who can or are willing to do that. 
The traditional "save 10% for all your life and put it in index" is excruciating.  It is a life that is not well lived.
Flat tax is the answer, but that will never happen in the U.S. because the tax legislation is where the congress gets all their power.  They use that power to repay donors and lobbyists and get more donations to stay in power.

At about a million, but the nerves all the way up would be hard to deal with.  Plus, life happens along the way.  So you never really know.  It's all theoretical until you have that money in the game and you start thinking like a lottery winner.  Would I like to be worth 50 mil?  
Of course. But when you are seriously faced with the question at 1 million or 4 million or 5 million net worth, you might have a hard time holding on given two things:  How much different your life can be right now and the uncertainty that keeps you awake at night waiting for something better that may not come.  How strong are really?  
Can you gamble on ten times 5 million?  Most people would start divesting at some point along the way unless it happened so fast that you couldn't resist the parabola.
I am really loving this speculation and volatility right now.  I haven't seen it since the late 90's and about 4 years ago when you could buy all that cheap real estate for basically nothing. 
If I had 10 million, I would quit.  A bit.  Maybe sell a third or move around to the new greatest tech that showed it's face.
One thing is for sure.  I would never deal with anyone who works in a cube farm ever again.  They can be so rigid.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:09:51
I don't want that.  It is simply an expectation that if an ETF is approved, more buying will happen.  That would raise the price.

When I search this sub, a lot of the threads are not exactly what I asked and there do seem to be new developments all the time that affect the answers. I'm just the latest person asking the question. 
There is a mountain of material to read and in it are people referencing events I don't understand. Hence the rabbit hole comment.  
I have gotten some clear advice here and got started on Gemini this afternoon and got a wallet.  It's a beginning. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 22:36:16
I have been on this path of thought for a year or two.  I feel like my time frame is 5 to 10 years.  I have invested money before and lost it all a few times.  I have also done the opposite.  You have to be in the game to win.  That is the risk.  
It is not current price appreciation that is appealing.  It is the finite quantity of coin that appeals to my logical brain.  
Most of my holdings in the stock market have been longer than three years, so I'm used to it.

Dude on here gifted me $2 in February while I was trying to figure it out, to help me.

I don't have your experience for the first two paragraphs.  Mine was different.  But I've been self employed for about 23 years.  Most of the people I know (and they are diverse) made it through with out what you described.  Or maybe they just called it life.
The rest of what you said sounds like I could have written it myself.  I agree.
Edit: a word.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:43:48
It's funny. I'm almost 50 and have been through all the good bubbles and crashes (except 1929). I have seen the same pattern over and over and it no longer bothers me to hold.  I'm not rich but have made  and lost a ton of money in the markets.  
Having the stones to hold is a learned talent. And not everyone gets it right.  I had a 27 year old buddy in 1999 holding 500,000$ in Yahoo stock when the tech bubble burst.  He kept saying it would be back.  It never came back.  
The difference between the tech bubble and BC is that the tech bubble was built on almost no earnings, hell, sometimes even no revenue.  WELL, that is the one thing that makes a company worth investing in!
Bitcoin is different. Finite.  Store of value.  New tech that changes the world of exchange.  This is new ground for me but based on the 30 years of watching markets, I'm in. For the long haul.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:30:18
Yeah.  I can math.  i understand it.  I also met a guy in his early 30's who won $80 million from a one dollar ticket.  So you guys go ahead and squirrel away your $52 dollars a year and tell everyone how good you are at math.  I'm going to live a little.  The one absolutely certain thing that $80 million dollar man knows: You can't win if you don't play.

I met someone last night who works for citizens.  She said the corporate culture there is so toxic that she would never do business there.  My banking experience has been pretty good.  But your last line is what I hope for the most.  I want the promise of a separate and independent viable currency.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:49:17
What has that turn out to be?
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:15:31
For example:
At the height of the real estate market in the US, I had committed to building a big house.  I had no choice then.
Timing the market is damn near impossible.  But if I had not made that fortuitous decision when I did, I would have had a huge amount cash (dry powder) to wield.  I could have bought three times the property I did.  
And the smart money waited a few years and that's EXACTLY what happened.  Everyone foreclosed.  The banks were inundated with {real estate owned} properties.  They are banks, not property managers.  Smart money bought that shit for pennies, sort of.  
I just pulled the trigger a year too early.  I couldn't double down in a bad market.
That is the difficult choice for most people.  In a bull market, no one wants to keep half their cash on the sideline waiting for a bear market because it feels like you are missing out.  Especially when that bull runs for 7 years.  That's a long time to sit on your hands.
On the other side, (not my example, but) catching a falling knife can be equally as hard.  No one knows when the bottom is.  Ever.  
I bought 2 weeks ago.  On the way down.  And then watched 20% get shaved off.
My point is this.  basedkaizen is right.
The time to go in is when EVERY single person has lost confidence.  But you have to have some dry powder to do it.
Thankfully, it's a lot easier to do that with crypto than rotten real estate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:28:49
The new price.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:48:31
I agree with most of what you said. There are numerous Cryptos.  And you never know what they will do.  But the blockchain tech is very solid.  And game changing.
Gold, on the other hand, is not at all finite.  You can mine that shit all day and people do that.  All day every day.  Hell, there is even a reality show about it.  Panning, not mining.  The point is that there is no mineral on earth that is finite.

This is a solid answer.  Unless you are young enough, don't mind working, make a decent living, etc.  If you have children in school and are close to family and that is important for you to maintain, a lot of times it makes sense to carry on with your life as is.  And ride the train. Oh, sorry. Roller coaster.
But if you have an exit strategy at a given time of life, whenever that is, and you get your number, take it.  No one at work is going to show up at your funeral.  Live life the way you want to.  If you can afford to do it at a young age, all the better.
I have this little parable based on an anecdote from my younger days that I have raised all my multitudinous children with for years.  We call it "The Crabs in the Bucket".
If you ever see a bunch of crabs in a bucket, you will certainly see one behavior.  When one tries to crawl out, all the rest will inevitably pull him back down.
That is a metaphor for life and jealousy that most people have to live with.  People, in general, don't like to see anyone do better than they are doing.  If it happens, like one crab tries to gets out of the bucket to freedom, all the other crabs tear them down.  They try to drag them back to the bucket.
Get a new car and drive it to work?  You will inevitably hear, "Must be nice to have enough money to afford a car like that!"
That thinking is insidious unless you are strong enough to deflect it.
Don't be one of the jealous crabs in the bucket who tries to deny the other crab a shot at their freedom.  Give them a pat on the back and say  "Good for you and your progress".
You have one life.  Enjoy it and don't get wrapped in the social part tied to your work and money.  There are plenty of Microsoft millionaires out there and actually I know one.  He is middle aged, has kids in college, one with an abusive dick head boyfriend.  He worries about his weight and his home value.  He puts his pants on the way you do and wants to maintain his life with his wife.  All normal shit for most people.  
Having money makes that easier, but it never takes away your problems. Ever.
Edit: a letter.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:26:49
Of course.  I can't include all of history.  The patterns are getting easier though.  For example, I maintain buildings.  I have now called three recoveries while the media continues to talk about the recession, shitty economy, unemployment or whatever.  
Because what I do takes me all over the country and has me dealing with people all over, I see that people are "recovering" a lot sooner than they like to admit.  
When you try to hire people to do a job and they complain that they would like to but they just have these six jobs to finish first, that is when we are in recovery.  
It has happened so often now that I scoff at the gloom and doom reporting because it has gone on now for three or four years longer than it should, in each case.  
In some cases, the media is still running with that old recession story after the economic cycle has run its course again.  During the Bush W. administration that happened.  
People were so in shock from the tech bubble that a whole recovery happened and left that they never noticed the recovery.  Mid 2000's.  Of course on the back side of that, derivatives and housing bubble.
I almost can't hire anyone right now.  We are currently in recovery. Or as I like to call it, not recovery (as if we always have to resuscitate a normal functioning economy like it's a terminal patient) but normal.

This is what I have the hardest time with when it comes to Bitcoin.  Not knowing who to trust.  I have wanted to ask this sub for a while (but have not) for a definitive, Bitcoin for beginners thread that doesn't require wading through days and days of linked posts to understand Bitcoin today and Bitcoin history.
