Hodling isn't good for an economy.  If your bitcoins were sitting in a bank, at least they would get reinvested.  Hodling just causes deflation.

So if someone asked Tim Cook today "What's the market for Apple Watch? and he said 5 million he'd be wrong because he was answering for this year and not the next few decades? Seems odd.

Bad news that no one is willing to use it without being pegged to a fiat currency.

Was he speaking long term? From the quote it sounds like he was referring to the present.

Not if he was talking about the market in 1943.

Bitcoin will never become stable.  Regular currencies are stable due to central banks that control inflation/deflation.  Bitcoin has no mechanism for stability.

Were you replying to the right comment?

Was he wrong in 1943?

In the second image, are you being paid in USD or in bitcoin? If you're being paid in bitcoin you're fucked.

Do you know what makes other currencies stable?
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:36:08
That's not true. Currencies don't stabilize naturally.  The main purpose of a central bank is stability specifically because currencies aren't stable by nature.  Where did you read that currencies get stability simply from high adoption?
