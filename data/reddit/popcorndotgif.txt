Most bitcoiners are libertarians, and most bitcoin forums and such are slanted libertarian. Not many women are attracted to libertarianism, for the same reason most minorities aren't.

Hello new user! I'm sure it's just a coincidence that you're posting on a brand new account with no history whatsoever. Nevertheless, that sounds like good advice! I think I'll take it. 
In fact, that's very convenient. You're talking about [the very first laptop listed under laptops]( And for .7438 BTC shipped, which is $592.48 according to the site! (I reloaded the page later, and it was at .7416 BTC. That's not worrying at all.) That's not a bad price, assuming I lived in the US (I don't but whatever). [Best Buy wants $604]( [Amazon wants $607]( and [Newegg wants $674]( But wait. .7438 BTC isn't $592 at all. If I go to Bitstamp to buy some bitcoins to actually buy this laptop, it's going to cost me...$606. So this is a good price, but it's not a significant savings over the competition at all.
Eh, maybe I don't want that laptop. How about try [the one linked immediately below it]( Oh. A 404 link isn't very useful.
How about [this Lenovo laptop]( BCS wants $1556 in BTC (which again, is about 5% more than that because of their favorable conversion rate), while [Amazon offers it for about $80 less]( shipped.
I looked around for more laptops, and when the page would actually load, they again weren't cheaper than other reputable sellers, ones which actually meet their promised shipping dates. But good luck with astroturfing your rickety-assed dropshipping service... with bitcoin!

I don't really feel like getting into a philosophical argument on one of the main fedora subreddits. The short version: rugged individualism sounds a whole lot less appealing the less powerful you are (or, at least, the less powerful you imagine yourself to be).
