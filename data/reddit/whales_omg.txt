that's the thing, zooming the price chart out, people have still made incredible money. On one hand you have to feel bad for the people who jumped in recently expecting the price to only rise but on the other I kind of don't because who juts expects that you can make money without doing anything? It's not how the world works. But as I say, zoom out, it's all good :)

I've been watching that too. What's the mechanism in place to stop this number just growing ever higher? e.g I could understand if it stayed at some high number constantly as new ones come in and old ones are confirmed but if that number just increases over time that doesn't seem good?

Can someone fill me in on how much approximately exchanges would be making when the market experiences 'abnormal' volatility?
This volatility always leads to huge trading volume, and the exchanges are clipping the ticket at each step right? This being the case would it not make sense for them to flood the market, cause a huge drop, rake in millions in fees, buy some more at the dip, wait for new money to pour in, rinse and repeat?

I wonder if the price will eventually stabilise to a point where people are trying to just trade to make small margins that are enough to offset the transfer costs a la forex investment.

All I can say is...What a time to be alive

God I wish I had the capital to pull of this kind of manipulative crap... They must just be laughing all the way to the bank (of actual money they can spend)

My friend's dog walker is also 'pivoting' into the space. Her dog walking (and blockchain) company just got 10 million in seed funding. This isn't a bubble, it's just how the world works. everyone makes tons of money and there's no downside. hoorah!

They can seem cool and get an article in the local paper about how they accept it and be somewhat relevant for 10 days?

You need to understand that 'investing' in cryptos is just speculative gambling. As such you need to treat it like gambling and not wager more than you're willing to lose. If you're really worried you should cash out whatever you're not willing to lose and cut your losses.
If you are hanging in there, understand you are a player in what is essentially a ponzi scheme and be willing to accept whatever comes with that, i.e if more 'greater fools' are willing to buy into the 'investment', you will keep making money like you would in any other ponzi scheme. Once people catch on it may collapse though so just treat it like a game of poker, and preferably not with your life savings.

My thing (call me ignorant), is I just can't accept the term 'correction', like what is it correcting to? Its fundamental value? What the hell even is that? Serious question
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:00:23
? Was just a friendly question. It's a vehicle of speculation at this point so everyone's just playing a game of I win if you lose, or am I looking at a different 'asset'?

A decrease in unwavering hype sometimes has that affect on bubble-esque assets

Yeah it's a funny conundrum. In order for it to be useful as a currency it has to have a relatively stable price, at which point it won't be as attractive to investors as it is in its current volatile state. So for it to become one thing it kind of has to stop being the other thing...
I'm definitely watching with interest. It's like nothing we've ever seen before.

Value is typically determined by the 'fundamentals' of an asset, and as we all know if there's one (and only, given it cant be used as a currency) fundamental of Bitcoin it's that it can only go up up up! My selling point prediction for 3 hours from now: $1.2 million
