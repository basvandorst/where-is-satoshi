Is all the transaction fee stuff just noise? I sent .067 bitcoin free yesterday. I was stunned. 
Looks like all you have to do is use GreenAddress or a hardware wallet?

When astronauts come back from space (zero gravity/zero resistance), they are so weak that it takes months to recover not only their muscle mass but their bone mass.

Not to coin a term for this sort of speculation, but is Operation Dragonslayer the first "conspiras ethereum"?

I sent .067 BTC to Bitconnect. For some reason, it was free, and fast. I'm not sure if they picked up the tab on the transfer fee, but I was extremely happy about it.

I guess Segwit2x is going to fork after all... and it's messing up the mining of a large block? Is this Segwit2x hang-up related to the dip? If it's as embarrassing as it looks, then the drop should be a lot more significant, yes?

Kinda short on fiat. I have a lot of credit, though. That wouldn't work on GDAX, would it? (Looking into it as well for cash, though, in the future, THANKS! Ending up with cash is always possible when you have a couple businesses, especially around Christmas...)
Oh my gosh, I just realized I already have GDAX and my bank account set up and have like a $10000 deposit/withdrawal limit! Whatttttt? This is so much better than Coinbase prices and fees. Thank you!

I'm with you. Where is the dip?

Best comment I've ever seen. Ever.

Thank you for the guesses guys! I want to drop in my max purchase at some point using credit (I'm at $1250 allowed) and then just ride it. So far, I have only gotten in a couple hundred here and there and some random litecoin and for some reason I got a bunch of ripple and am just kinda hodling.

I'm new, but since I got interested in BTC &lt;2 months ago, it has more than doubled. I think it'll be 10,000 in &lt;2 weeks. This baby is exponential.

Sadly, I can relate, and I'm not even buying.

I notice you say keep mining. That is my thought, especially with bitcoin at this price. I am in now for 20+ TH/s, yet I still feel inclined to buy BTC. Is it always better to mine? Seems so to me, but at the same time, the price of the mining doesn't seem to be going up, so BTC I've purchased would be worth more mining power. That keeps jacking me up, and I get confused all over again.

How deep would you guess it will go?

9500 each or total?

Last time I used BCH  (which was to sell it for some bitcoin), it took WAY longer than BTC to send. I thought it was never going to arrive. I think it was because of the size of the blocks. It must've been 2 hours. BTC never took me 2 hours. I know some people get bad times because fees were calculated wrong and stuff...
