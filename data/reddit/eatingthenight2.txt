12 million is high but if someone told you a bitcoin was going to be worth 300$ in 2009 I think you would have the same reaction and I would as well. Of course that doesn't justify the 12 million price tag but in all honesty no one has any clue what will happen with bitcoin in 2019.

I don't think laziness is ever an excuse although you may have some other ones as well. Someone build it with docker put it in the damn docs and call it a day.
@_date: 2014-09-11 02:01:39
bro do you even svg?
@_date: 2014-07-04 16:03:00
It's not a bugfix it's an easy solution that keeps the software from becoming bloated. The "feature" you are asking for has been implemented 100 times and better no need to redo work. If you really want it that much fork it build in the support and submit a pull request.
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:09:42
lol, really close to wholesale? I love to support the bitcoin economy but you can get your products on amazon for 50% or less even after the code. what a scam. 
164 on your site. 77 on amazon.

It does not look like it. However I plan on rebuilding this idea from the ground up shortly as I find this idea would be awesome for my development team.
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:40:35
and thats why it will never get that low. If it hits sub 250 I have a feeling a lot of people are going to be jumping in and buying feeling like its a chance to get back in on something they originally missed out on.
@_date: 2014-09-16 02:24:54
yes having professional programmers helps but it's 100 times easier to re-implement old code then it is to create new one.
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:38:29
I would argue that docker is not unnecessary and has worked hard with others to implement a solution that is really really easy to use. Obviously you don't feel the same way but I have already seen the benefit of docker in application deployment since we are running RHEL 7 at work which supports docker out of the box.
@_date: 2014-09-16 02:23:42
At some point you have to cut this shit and ship a working product.... or you can spend the extra year it would have taken to have a sane structure.

I know some places 6 cents might be a bit of money but really who is running into 6 cents being any kind of issue? this is needless bitching if you ask me.

O sweet fucking justice. I did not lose much since I paid with cash but I  hate josh and If he could serve some jail time that would be awesome. That smug prick.
@_date: 2014-08-24 20:12:53
why don't you use testnet.... ya know because that's what it was invented for....
@_date: 2015-05-11 04:26:00
well looks like everyone can stop mining litecoin now.
@_date: 2015-05-11 06:39:10
I would argue the difficulty of the change but a core dev could better speak to this. I will take back significant though because like you said this will be something that the miners will need to accept so in that way it would be very significant.
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:04:18
It is not useful to figure this out. You can google to find out what historically happens when this discussion comes up.
@_date: 2015-05-11 06:05:13
I don't think you truly understand what it means to be first to market and all of the advantages that brings. Litecoin made a call before it was needed because it saw bitcoin might in a few years need to have a shorter block time. Turns out its not a significant or hard change to make don't think that means anyone backed the wrong coin. The wrong coin would be the one that has developers who don't fully understand the technology they are working on.
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:09:08
ya nothing about 21co has made sense yet to anyone who has thought about it for more than 10 seconds. The launch will be interesting.
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:14:47
haha insane I wish I could still mine. I had a blast setting up all the hardware when it was just GPU mining and still when it was early ASIC stage. Sucks that I can't afford to mine even at a small margin anymore.

I mean I think he is a smart guy but that is really not a source it's just someone referring to satoshi as a woman.

 you can calculate it yourself.
@_date: 2015-08-11 02:38:40
well then you better start working on bitcoin core.
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:53:29
too many people running servers who don't know anything about security.
@_date: 2015-08-08 06:34:30
Yeah they are in startup mode still they are worried about getting market share not revenu.
@_date: 2015-08-31 07:33:50
We had a guy who did this. He is now facing a lawsuit. It's really not worth the few dollars you will make.
@_date: 2015-08-03 00:57:25


not really.. thats just a mining issue. The currency itself is still useful.
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:00:04
Hahahaha pretty much the only reason to get one

@_date: 2015-08-23 20:44:55
what for significantly improving bitcoin core and keeping the project alive? Do people not understand just how smart you have to be and how much time you need to dedicate to learning the bitcoin code base so you can even begin to apply minor patches? This is all done for free by the way. What do you do in your free time? I'm sure nothing as significant.
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:52:46
He is a very talented programmer I wouldn't call him an idiot. He just has some strong religious beliefs and is very vocal about them as well as some of his other opinions. People have been around for a while know this and ignore some of him more extreme statements. We really don't need to make a post about every time he does this though.
@_date: 2015-08-03 00:55:48
devs already talked about if this happens it wouldn't be for a long time. They can change the software to take bitcoins that haven't moved in say 200 years and add them back to the mining pool.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:28:59
cool another miner that will never hit ROI.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:50:56
no, doing this has 0 benefits. You have to be a moron to do this.
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:24:12
nope most people don't. Anyone mining right now is crazy and if they are making a profit they are in a crazy arms race that the richest person will win.
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:01:09
selection bias.
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:58:29
o wow you are right I thought it wouldn't bother me but i got a headache when i was reading it.
@_date: 2015-08-28 06:29:40
What? Why?... first doing it with a username is completely pointless if you know how mining in a pool works. Second why add BIPS that aren't out yet? I'm sure slush will add them as they are needed. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:22:33
yeah i always thought bitcoin was much more scalable than this. Once i saw 220k transactions a day was taxing the system I had a little reality check. Bitcoin has a long way to go before any large company can take it seriously.
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:26:07
yeah i don't know of any miners being sold currently that will break even. these ASIC manufactures must be making a fortune on people like this.
@_date: 2015-07-14 05:06:45
It would be interesting to see how the network held but I have a feeling it would be very slow and a lot of nodes run on poor performing nodes would fail. I agree the people are not ready for it though. Although who knows when you put people in a very hard place things happens that you normally don't expect.

i pay out the ass but at least i am lucky enough to have 100 Mb up / down.

Likely best you are not associated with the moderators during this time to be honest. Your reputation is worth far more.

@_date: 2015-09-03 03:38:57
yep this is how people waste weeks of time arguing over shit that doesn't matter.
@_date: 2015-09-30 06:29:32
Hopefully a ton. We need to be able to handle stuff like this without breaking a sweat or bitcoin will never become successful.

@_date: 2015-03-29 18:06:57
Unless you have 50MB + Upload you are really not helping the network as no one is going to connect to your node.
I ran one on a 80 MB + line for a while but turned it off because the cable company was going to be pissed at me pretty soon.
@_date: 2015-10-01 07:51:32
Doesn't matter. The vocal minority of bitcoin users have taken it upon themselves to make this community as hostile as possible. Hopefully we can make it through this and attract a different audience or at least more people who will drowned out the current vocal minority.
