I just bought bitcoin. My question is why last year when it was $12,000 everybody was buying up like there was no tomorrow. Now this year nobody seems to care which is not making the price go up������

yep i learned a lesson and to never invest all my money. I've been struggling ever since. But I'm hoping my may of next year it's all over and i can take everything out

will Litecoin halving have any effect on bitcoins price
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:44:57
im kinda glad I never sold when it was reached $3,500 in 2018. I've been hodling since 2017 bought in at $16,000 each. almost gave up sometimes. But now I'll just wait Maybe it will pass $20,000 but who knows

whoever said bitcoin will be 250k in 5 yrs and it doesn't matter what price buy at. if that's the case then why aren't rich people buying bitcoin stocking up. Like kevin o leary thinks bitcoin will crash

im confused it was just a question
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:19:06
i was just curious because isn't it suppose to getting higher until the halving event. but like what if break the previous ath of $20,000 in December then there is a huge possibility it would drop down to all time lows again

@_date: 2019-08-06 06:54:27

i got a question for everybody. let's say you have over $100,000 in bitcoin. and your girlfriend cheats on you after 1 yr. would you guys be sad or don't even care. ��������.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:39:00
that's me after Investing $110,000 into it
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:27:49
let's say bitcoin reaches $50,000 and you make $350,000 in total. your in your 3rd semester of college to get your associates degree. Would you stay in college or leave
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:00:27
just working everyday, doing overtime every week just to pay bills. i put my life savings into bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:49:28
������������������ everytime bitcoin is about to break $12,000 it goes down. i don't get why people can't just hold it instead of selling
@_date: 2019-08-22 04:59:11
a girlfriend. ppl say money buys happiness but i find that untrue. i have all this money in bitcoin but i feel more sad �� and alone then ever. like what's the purpose of having this if i don't have one person to be with and spend my life with.
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:34:25
if that's the case doesn't that mean bakkt will have tens of thousands of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-11 07:48:07
everybody said BAKKT would help out. i don't see anything and I'm ������������
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:03:50

@_date: 2019-09-02 20:28:35
