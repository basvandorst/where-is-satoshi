Why would you tell anyone you buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:44:46
I heard about it during 2016 and should have bought then but I wasn’t as big a skeptic back then.  
But this is fun money regardless so I’m in it to win it

Its not an understanding thing.  People are sadly just not very bright in some cases.
I worked in tax collection and saw peoples bank statements sometimes.  They will have 50 dollars there, they KNOW their 35 dollar payment is coming out monday morning, but they will go to 8 different fast food places over the weekend and have 3 dollars left.  It just defies reality but thats how a substantial number of people live

Yeah income is more about what you net than what you gross
Someone making 50k might end up with more than someone making 100k if their choices in lifestyle are better

Why wouldnt he
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:00:24
Imo its the same as pushing your kids out there to support healthcare reform or gun control or to condemn abortion.  
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:20:00
And BTW a driverless car with a driver killed someone yesterday
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:53:45
Good talk but I’m against pushing your kids out there for political gain.  Even if its all true.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:27:00

Im all for driverless.  However you have to be sober and expect a few dozen people to die before we get it right.  Maybe hundreds.  Its just a part of progress sadly

Its still just children being used as propaganda
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:40:48
Yep.  Think of how many people are killed in electrical accidents each year.  Its still nfinitely better than living without electricity

Europe is going broke at breakneck speed.  “Anti money laundering” likely translates to “we’re going to tax the shit out of people who own crypto with some vague excuse of fighting crime”
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:17:21
Sometimes a simple “Sorry, I didn’t understand, may I please pay my tax with reduced penalties since this a first for me?” Will actually work.  I’m a CPA who used to collect taxes.
NEVER call a tax dept and tell them off.  They write in your file that you were an ass and it follows you to the grave.  Just be nice and there is a good chance you are treated better
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:56:02
Are you joking or actually that stupid?
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:49:47
Im trying to make easy money because the opportunity cost is low
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:44:03
They're too stupid for regular money, electricity, computers, cars, plumbing, etc... and get along just fine.  
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:33:30
Let people think what they want.  There is no reason you have to interject on bitcoins behalf.

Rich people can dabble in anything.  Its no great loss if they lose some cash
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:48:56
You just spent an asset with high potential to grow in value when you could have spent an asset that is garaunteed to shrink in value.
You should only be spending bitcoins on food if you need to for survival or if you think its hit its peak.

You don’t dollar cost average your spending money.  Thats investment terminology.  If you dollar cost average but then spend like cash, you’re just bragging that you spent your cash.  Whoop de doo.

@_date: 2018-02-27 15:37:19
Yeah but you still have USD left to spend I’m guessing...
It doesn’t matter long term but it seems like a foolish habit to get into.  You don’t want to look back in 3 years and realize you spend 500$ on a burrito

People would still complain they couldn’t afford it right now

Yep.  Don’t be a Crypto Cuck

Whats the best way to get out of coinbase?  Please and thanks
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:43:43
Well not as it relates to this topic anyway

If you invested 9.81 3 years ago it would be worth 411 today

Not if your income just goes up by 1k
However they have more sophisticated methods than we probably know about.  They generally wont access your bank records hardly ever.  But if it bothers you and you did realize the gain, I’d probably report it.
They operate on a cost/benefit basis just like you and me.
I’m also a CPA so if I get caught lying to a tax agency its a big deal.  Also there was no crypto in the exam so I could be way off base
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:47:48
Gross income is all income from any source derived unless excluded

He could have 10 of those if he desired
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:57:49
You buy crypto with after-tax money and its essentially like buying a foreign currency.  Nobody reports if they go to Europe, take out 10k in cash to get Euros, and incidentally has a foreign currency gain.
But the IRS considers any income to be agi unless excluded.  I don’t agree with it but I have fewer guns than they do
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:51:31
You should probably only spend crypto if you are hiding the paper trail of the transaction or are literally in a situation where money is not available.
Otherwise just use cash.  
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:11:34
Because the IRS gets their rocks off investigating this deduction
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:48:34
When the IRS wants to hear your opinion they will ask you for it
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:17:39
I’m not open to people who have no intention of adopting a Western mindset and actually helping civilization.  They can go back to their countries they ruined
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:50:56
And when the day comes, the IRS will ask for our opinion.
But until that day we have to follow their rules or risk the consequences
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:08:32
Also avoid home office deductions
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:25:34
Go back to @_date: 2018-04-16 14:52:39
Whats sad is now that they know, they might decide you owe more.  As opposed to those people who hid and got away with it.
I used to collect taxes and sadly it happens

Certain events trigger it.  Large jumps in income, high income individuals, large self employment deductions, eic fraud, etc all are more likely to be reviewed
The average Joe making 60k every year has very low audit risk
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:34:27
Thats only a fair point if you immediately used cash to replenish the butcoin you spent.
