That seems good and everything, but you are still trusting in a centralized organization. I would prefer a token pegged to the price of gold relying in a lot of exchanges as oracles to fix the price

DigixDAO has the same problem as Bitgold or any other service with a middleman. If the gold that backs DigixDAO tokens is stolen or is proved that not every token is backed by gold or whatever, DigixDAO tokens would be worthless in a blink

This comment is spot on

How do you think they would have proceeded if they have knew it better, in order to "kill it in the crib"?

NOTHING is 100% unhackable. Requiring unnecessary vulnerabilities to a company is just wrong. Yeah, they got hacked. They lost some reputation, but their point is as valid as ever
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:31:55
Yep. That also could be one of the reasons

I think that's a good guess of what would happen. They 've would have trolled every cryptocurrency to death every time. The crypto-ecosystem would be in a far harsher scenario.

Yeah, those things wouldn't be so effective to fight encryption.

Maybe this is asap.
You have to collect the right amount of capital to reinvest and buy the hardware at the right time, so you get a good price/performance ratio. But obviously I'm just guessing. There are a lot of variables in this. I'm just saying that this could be one of them.

This actually makes sense. If I had a mining operation I'd upgrade my mining hardware before the halving so I could profit twice the amount for a few months before the halving

Now you mention it. That's pretty awesome. For me the oficial break through moment for cryptocurrency into the mainstream media, was when Nature published [this]( article and even metioned Ethereum.

Not really. That's the price the market is willing to pay for any bitcoin, even if nobody knows how many Bitcoins are lost.
@_date: 2016-05-11 21:42:49
Haha, wut? xD

I see your point, but actually writing in the Constitution that
* Freedom of speech is an unquestionable right of every human being no matter what
* Sharing information through any kind of information channel is exercising your freedom of speech
is really necessary to protect the crypto-ecosystem and our freedom in general.
