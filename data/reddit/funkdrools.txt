For a sort of condensed discussion on bitcoin, I'll point you over to r/bitcoinDiscussion but admittedly some of the best discussion is here, but you have to sift through the fluff

They created the token to raise funds. The raiden project does not utilize the raiden token at all.

LN nodes can be run on a mobile device, and due to the benefits of segwit, you do not need to remain online to receive funds. 
So yes, you can close it and be done with the Lightning network.
and yes, this was possible even in the earliest testnet versions of lightning network.  months ago.....sigh.

you underestimate government waste.
"Officials could not find any reason for the other 200 people to be there.
“Nobody knew what those people were doing, if they were doing anything,” said Michael Horodniceanu, who was then the head of construction at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs transit in New York. The workers were laid off, Mr. Horodniceanu said, but no one figured out how long they had been employed. “All we knew is they were each being paid about $1,000 every day.”" [Source](

LN nodes need to be online to monitor the behavior of parties within a payment channel.
If the underlying protocol has segwit implemented, then a party for a transaction can go offline, and a third party can monitor the counterparty for any attempt to broadcast a previous state.
The node on your phone will need to keep its connection to the LN active to function as a third party for other transactions.  If your mobile OS has memory management, like Android or iOS then you will likely need to keep the app open on your screen the entire time.

You're not crazy, there is a reason why most of the other large scale vision blockchain protocols have multi layer scaling solutions off chain. This is not limited to BTC, but ETH(plasma, raiden), NEO (trinity), ICX (see whitepaper), QTUM (layered network as well), just to name the major projects backed by great teams
Somehow there is a community that believes linear scaling onchain is the only proper way forward, but they are clearly the minority. I see this similar to the anti vaccine movement, anti evolution, anti climate change communities that cannot be reasoned with, despite them trying to argue against prevailing theory and evidence and working models and deployed models.
Forget the debate. Does the 1MB cap need to be broken in BTC? Yes, of course. But scaling should happen on chain and off chain and it looks like most of the cryptouniverse is going that way.

for most of us, you are correct, but to get BTC and LN to acheive mass adoption, we need this to become as foolproof and effortless and invisible as possible. Joe Sixpack should not have to manually set fees, and stilll have  giid siftware that chooses the best fee rate at the moment.  Our software needs a lot of refinement, and that is the bottleneck. good developers and mother time herself.

They have full control of the private keys of the addresses they allow you to use. So don't be fooled in thinking your coins are on your possession until you transfer them safely to addresses where you have the private keys and only you.
If you want full control of your coins, transfer your coins to an address where only you have the private keys, otherwise you're just trusting someone else to hold your money.
My personal recommendation is a Ledger Nano S  or Trezor hardware wallet

your background will help you understand where BTC is trying to go , in terms of big picture, during this debate of block sizes (ethernet scaling - BCH fans vs layering with TCP/IP - BTC)
Meanwhile others can only cheer for what they understand: bigger blocks now = cheaper and faster transactions now
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:07:42
You only have to go to about the 4th minute of the first lecture of Lightning Network from Joseph Poon from a conference in 2016 to find out that a state channel with 2 parties can take part of a network of transactions because either party can act as an intermediary in multiple other state channels without each party opening more than 2 channels each.  
You also seem to not understand the difference between a token and an protocol due to your last paragraph.

I think there was a recent talk on the improvements in block propogation by Maxwell about what the recent (maybe upcoming) improvements in the Core client would bring to improve this situation. Miners have a tiny disadvantage if they wait to package a new block after one is mined (not sure if its only when the pool itself just mined the most recent block?) So they mine an empty block to be close to an even chance of getting the next block rewards which are substantial right now

The lightning network offers trustless, instant, cheap transactions across a network of payment channels that need to be built up over years that scales to handle multiple orders of transfusions more than any existing blockchain technology without the bloat, and in a blockchain that has segwit, you even have some offline support. It also offers an aspect of proof of stake to stabilize the network. All while preventing the blockchain from developing bloat and minimizing the costs of running a node due to it's efficiency.
Also. Be careful not to confuse tokens with protocol. Just because I don't deposit the $5 cash given to me into my bank account doesn't mean I don't own the $5 that exists in my hand.

He meant for the block size to be increased with a lifting of the cap. However the current developers are concerned about the Bitcoin network shrinking and losing its security because adoption rate and growth of nodes has fallen due to the networks throughput demands. At this point were looking at probable 300GB/month outbound traffic and maybe 250gb storage needed for the near term future without blocksize increases.
Scaling solutions are mostly bet on the lightning network with some minor improvements from Segwit, Schnorr signatures, MAST for the blockchain itself.
The other concern is privacy.
The developers want to improve privacy on the blockchain and there is discussion of things like RingCT being implemented for confidential transactions, and historically this comes with something like a 40x blockweight increase (but recent research showing potential to negate this penalty), so the blocks are getting bigger already and increasing the block weight of the transactions would multiply the blocksize to sizes even bigger than BCH 8mb blocks. 
Looks like they want to add all the features in first  assess how big the blocks are, then see how much bigger the transaction weight needs to be.
I'm not disagreeing or agreeing with this approach, just my interpretation from following the drama.
Also. Remember that Satoshi stepped away from Bitcoin development to allow the development to continue without his influence. So it's up to the community to shape the future of the protocol through consensus

The other way of thinking about it according to Andreas is thinking LN is like a proof of stake system.

This was a great, short, update. Unfortunately there isn't as much information about Schnorr  sigs from most bitcoin analysis sources, while there are plenty about segwit. So I found this very helpful.
Bitcoin needs to stay at the forefront of innovation and solid tech advancements to maintain its position as the number one currency. 
Scaling in a smart way is the only way forward for longevity and solid fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:06:25
While encouraging, it hardly suggests it will happen in the next couple of months. If they are not even testing it, it sounds like a few months at best. So I'm both encouraged at their willingness to increase block size, I'm discouraged at it sounding like there are no current plans to do so.

The bip for the increase to 2mb was submitted by garzik a while ago. Unfortunately it was not followed through with.
I prefer btc long term, and i think because the deployment of scaling solutions are either not gaining consensus (segwit) or far off and also not universally practical (LN) a modest block size increase is a very reasonable near term step. Even Andreas supported this thought in the past
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:37:47
He wants both currencies to be strong. He wins when the mining community stays strong to keep buying his mining equipment. That worked during the American gold rush, and it will work with mining crypto. If either currency falls, he loses customers
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:52:47
I agree as well, but with this recent fork attempt, both sides took hardliner approaches without looking for compromise.  Bitcoin makes it extremely difficult to create consensus changes, off chain scaling had its first concession with segwit. I think Core should consider a small block size increase as an olive branch in the meantime to keep the currency strong and the community united.  Otherwise, this drama will only continue over and over again and BTC might continue to lose market share and its lead over other strong coins (such as BCH)

I've read similar comments in the past, read your comment, and never really understood it. Then I read this article after I read your comment:
And now I understand the side of your arguement better.
However the cost of implementing a 2mb block size increase can be outweighed by helping to prevent further loss of support from our mining friends who are securing the network and processing our transactions. Meeting in the middle should always be considered IMO

thats like asking who coded snarks? is it open sourced?
segwit is a transaction malleability fix, that is implemented by many open source blockchain protocols, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Digibyte, Vertcoin, and many more
You can goto Github, which is the same place open source code for many of these protocols have been hosted for YEARS.
Information about changes to BTC have been discussed in multiple conferences in academic, peer-reviewed settings, at pretiguous universities such as Stadford, including Bitcoin Scaling Conference, for years, tested on testnet for several months (many times over 12 months)
instead of asking these questions on this thread, i encourage you to just take 5 seconds to look for the answers yourself

Two differing schools of thought. Block size increases by themselves don't scale well to Visa and MasterCard levels. But multiple off chain layers can. So it's a temporary fix that will bring a permanent downside. On the opposing side. Suffering the temporary limitations of bitcoin until the off chain advances come it might cause bitcoin to lose its lead in value and mainstream acceptance. Both sides want the same thing but absolutely disagree how to do it. I'm eating popcorn.

While these are valid points. You seem to imply the two reddit forums represent the typical people behind each side of the debate. Meanwhile reading and listening to proponents of both sides in public debates don't reflect the reddit forums. Deciding based on the reddit forums would be foolish.

The market is wide open. A friend tried to start a small scale, mining operation in the mid 5-figure, low 6figure USD  investment size. Ordering the best asic mining units is difficult enough do to demand as soon as the new units are released (think ordering iPhone on apple website in release day) and then you wait 2+ months for the shipment to come while the customers with inside connections mine away before you even get a chance to start. It's almost like a pre-mine with each generation of asic miners. It's a pity almost every other competitor is gone

Blockstream isn't the main driving force behind LN. Payment channel networks are being developed for most largescale modern blockchain protocols including BTC, ETH, NEO, Etc...
Blockstream is only one of many people developing an implementation of payment channels
