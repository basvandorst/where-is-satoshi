The problem with bitcoin doubling every four years is that eventually to send a $20 transaction, we'll be paying $0.60 in fees.  Which is basically credit-card fees.  And there goes the entire concept of bitcoin being a low-fee currency.  
Consumers have no reason to use bitcoin (they get 2% is frequent flier miles back on credit cards).  Merchants would love bitcoin because they could save that 2.9% credit card fee.  So, if the value of bitcoin quadruples, there is no more point for merchants to use it due to high network fees.  Then... the only people who use it will be criminals.

Businesses do not profit from the blockchain transaction fees being low.  It's about enabling consumers to use bitcoin as the "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" envisioned by Satoshi.  Consumers are the ones suffering when they have to pay $1.20 just to send someone $25.  Most people in the world make $1.20 per day.  They are the customers of bitcoin, not the Core, BU, Miners.  Now, I get it that perhaps BU is buggy as all hell and not ready for prime time.  I will never argue for pushing code that is not ready into production.  BUT the argument here is not BU vs Core, the argument should be about what do we need to do to get BU code ready for production OR let's discuss an alternative to BU that accomplishes the same goal.  SegWit will not scale.  Without onchain scalability, bitcoin is not the "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" and will never be.

Urgency is real.  Costs to operate  have risen dramatically due to miner fees.  Users who used to pay $0.12 to purchase a $25 Amazon gift certificate now have to pay $1.20 and going up weekly.  Many of our customers are in countries where they make $2 per day on average -- bitcoin is all but unusable for them now.  Segwit limits will be tested within 6-9 months and then what?  We are back in the same hole.  Let's fix the problem for years go come.  If BU implementation is crap, well, let's figure out ways to test it and get the quality up.  They are the only ones who have a solution on the table.

After Segwit, we will be back to this point in 6 months.  Someone has to propose and debate decentralized scaling strategy post-SegWit.  I have not heard one.  The only people to propose one is BU.  Noone wants buggy software in production.  Instead of criticizing, why doesn't Core just adopt BU vision and implement their own solution?

We sincerely apologize that your transaction failed.  I can assure you that transfer failing has nothing to do with the price movement.  We go through a security review of each transaction and sometimes our processor rejects transfers due to various issues related to security related to "Know Your Customer" rules.  If you would please email support we will be sure to investigate.

Guys -- bitcoin integration with Starbucks is very cool via iPayYou: check out video on how it works here: 
iPayYou.io is the easiest, safest, and most useful bitcoin wallet of them all.  Not sure as to why any negative claims (perhaps from competitors?).  
Re: private keys...  iPayYou is a spending wallet ... send money to friends, buy gift cards, reload your starbucks account.  We have had hundreds of "forgot password" requests:  all those customers with other wallets would have lost all their cash.  Not with iPayYou.  Funds are never pooled ... your balance is visible right there on the blockchain.  It's a terrific wallet!
Any questions?  Direct to support

Confirmation delay is almost always due to the amount of fee you added to your transaction.  Unfortunately, the right fee is very difficult to compute.  It is based on 1) length of transaction which is not easy to tell ahead of time and 2) how congested blockchain is.  
At this minute, the right fee is about 0.0005 btc per each 1K of transaction size.  3 hours ago, it was 0.0003 btc per 1K of transaction.  
If you don't put the appropriate fee, it may take hours (and sometimes days) to confirm.  
(shameless plug follows) ... iPayYou.io wallet ( on Twitter) automatically calculates the right fee based on size and time of day so you don't overpay.
Good luck!

When I first heard of a company called "Yahoo" I was wondering how anyone took them seriously.  Most importantly -- it's all about usability and function.  iPayYou.io lets you pay by email and Twitter, buy and sell bitcoin cheaply, transaction cancellation, automatic adjustment of network fees based on blockchain load, etc.  Way easier to use than Circle or Coinbase.

Re: Private Keys:  We hold them because typical, non-technical users lose them.  We handle dozens of "Lost Password" resets daily.  If they held their own keys, they would lose all access to funds with no recovery.  Of course, most wallets don't care if their customers lose private keys as long as it's not their fault.  We do care about our customers.

Please try  ... Would love your opinion on how easy to buy/sell.  Also -- iPayYou.io is least expensive with 0.5% flat fee commission to buy BTC.

I've watched both videos.  Do you realize that neither video specifically tells you what is wrong with S2x?  
Overwhelming argument used is "you can't scale to every person transacting on chain".  Sure, I get it.  We cannot scale to 24TB blocks.  Got it.  But why CAN'T we scale to 2MB blocks?  What's wrong with 8MB blocks?  Is it the slippery-slope argument: "If I give you 2MB, you'll then ask for 24TB, so I won't even give you 2MB"?  You know, that is not a cogent argument.
I run a business dependent on enabling every-day bitcoin transactions.  I get hundreds of emails per day from customers complaining about fees with the message "just send me money by check" at the end.  They do.not.care about the "but your discount comes at the price of freedom" argument (Sorry Andreas).  These people worry about putting food on the table.  We sell $25 gift cards to places like Amazon.com and we ask people to pay $4 fee.  They just ignore bitcoin and then buy it with a credit card directly from Amazon.  
When we talk about "consensus" we must always include the voices that we turn away at the door, or we just become an echo chamber.  Those who say "users reject 2x blocks" have been sitting in this echo chamber for way too long.  They should talk to some real people out there who do not care about politics of the bitcoin "elite".

I also invested in Bitcoin because it's decentralized permissionless money.  
But what good is the money if you must pay a 30% fee each time you use it?  It's the largest "tax" of any in the world.  
It is the single biggest complaint we receive.  It may be fine to some individuals but to the mom-and-pop on the street the answer of "you are paying the 30% tax but you are using decentralized money" doesn't really fly.  They all worry about putting food on the table.
And lastly -- I haven't seen any concrete proof that any chance is any more or less centralized.  We all saw the "central authority" in Etherium causing a split away from Etherium Classic causing the original, true Etherium to get denigrated to a mini-coin.  Yet there are no screams of Etherium being centralized.  All we have here is the fact that everyone knows that Bitcoin won't be more or less centralized with 1MB, 2MB, or 4MB blocks.  Memory is plentiful and cheap.  
Last point: if centralization was a problem, then someone would have by now quantified the amount of centralization that is Red, Yellow, and Green and make sure we stay in the Green.  Yet, noone has made that definition, leaving amount of centralization to be subjective in nature - up to interpretation of every person depending on their potentially hidden agenda.  I have an idea: let's define "centralization" in an objective manner, place that definition in open-source and then we can all watch to see if some scaling solution creates more or less of a problem.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:57:45
We can't arrive at a consensus because by nature, people disagree with each other.  We have customers who want lower fees - should I just ignore them?  I'm not playing politics with the coin - I'm just trying to deliver to my customers what they want.  And if the only way to achieve this is with a fork, then a fork it will be.  
Perhaps forking is a lesser of 2 evils between that and a closed system under centralized control.  People always disagree, so we should expect dozens if not hundreds more forks since for every person who thinks a change is "an upgrade" there is another person who thinks it's "an attack on the network".
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:30:23
There is no reason for users NOT to want 2x.  It is obvious that transactions will take longer to confirm under 1x and fees will be higher.  So, if  user wants to buy a "cup of coffee", why would he/she want to pay a higher fee?  I can't imagine a single user who would prefer 1x over 2x and I challenge anyone here to provide a rational (as opposed to an emotional) scenario where a regular user would prefer 1x.  I argue that if exchanges chose to brand 2x as "BTC", the users would flock to it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:29:29
Hi frys180 - thanks for a rational thought and discussion.  Let me respond in 2 ways.
Short term: the debate is between 2MB and 1MB and I doubt you will find anyone who thinks 2MB will cause any centralization of mining.  We do know for a fact that larger blocks will lead to smaller fees and faster confirmation.  What user would NOT want this?
Longer term: before we discuss bitcoin becoming re-centralized, we need to define what "centralized bitcoin" looks like.  Is it centralized when a single pool controls 45% of the hashrate?  Is it centralized when the entire hashrate is under 5phs?  Are we even remotely close to the "danger points" of centralization?  Simple solution: let's define danger points and keep scaling the network to see if we start approaching them.  Then let's have a debate on centralization.  I think that scaling capacity will not trigger any centralization dangers - there are a LOT of miners with a LOT of money to spend, none of who want to collapse the price due to centralization issues.
Lastly: I agree with you that there is no such thing as infinite scaling.  Noone is arguing for 24TB blocks.  I am arguing that we should scale with demand and find new solutions that enable scaling.  Arguing that we should stay with 1MB blocks is akin to arguing that we should be all using 9600 baud modems because internet speeds cannot scale infinitely.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:51:29
I also agree that 2MB block isn't going to hurt.  So why ANYONE would prefer B1X over B2X is beyond me. Every argument against B2X that I've heard is political/emotional - not technical.  
We have 100K  wallet users.  We get dozens of emails daily requesting LOWER fees.  Not a single email asking us to stick to B1X no matter what.
We are very strongly considering pushing B2X as BTC (although we are still waiting to see what happens with replay protection).  Without such protection, the longest chain becomes BTC so the entire B1X vs B2X argument becomes moot.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:36:54
You know, this argument makes no sense. 
You make 2 points:
1. Supporters of 2x are "bunch of gangsters". and
2. Their dev team is "non-existent".
Because you claim the two points are true, then the entire 2x project is a scam.
By that logic, if the two points as your rationale for 2x being a scam were disproven, would you then agree that 2x is not a scam?
I don't want to go point-by-point disproving your two assumptions because I feel you think that 2x is a scam for other reasons as well.  If those reason were disproven, you will continue to think that 2x is a scam.
So, this is an emotional rather than a logical issue for you and as we all know, emotional issues (like religion) can never be disproven.  
I do respect your emotional response but my original point was completely logical in nature.
If you hold both chains and one of them fails miserably (makes no difference which one), you still have the entire value of coins in the 2nd chain.  Thus, if you are HODLing it, then you have all the value.
In eCommerce, however, any transaction with lower fees will win (which is why so many merchants avoid accepting AmEx -- their fees are the highest of all the credit cards).  In blockchain-speak, any chain with a lower demand/supply ratio will have lower fees.  As the 2x chain as the larger supply, eCommerce will naturally shift to that chain (over time).
My goal is not to engage in emotions but rather have a logical, thoughtful discussion.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:35:19
Since an average BTC investor is hodling both chains, it makes no difference to him/her which chain succeeds and prevails.  If 2x chain succeeds, that's fine to anyone who is HODLING.
If you want to use Bitcoin in eCommerce, however, 2x chain will lead to lower fees.

The goal of CPFP is to have child pay for a parent whose fee is too low for the miners to confirm.
  The way I understood your suggestion is "pay enough for the original transaction".  If I had paid enough for the original transaction, we wouldn't even need CPFP.  So I'm assuming I misinterpreted what you are trying to say.
  Same comment as above.  If my 0-fee transaction doesn't propagate and that prevents my child transaction from getting confirmed, then there is no way for the child to pay for parent.  
Re: do I know whether Eligius had my original transaction:
How do I tell?  We have tried submitting directly to Eligius but the process seems to be failing.  Is anyone aware of how to submit to Eligius directly (from personal experience)?
Thanks all!
@_date: 2015-11-01 22:24:58
Here are the details of our not-so-successful CPFP experiment:
Parent transaction:
(Hex: 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)
Child transaction: 
(Hex: 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)
Both hex strings were transmitted directly to the Eligius pool via: 
 
The UI from Eligius.st shows "Trying to send..." yet the response is a 200 OK, so my assumption is that the transaction succeeded despite no formal confirmation from the UI.
HOWEVER: Eligius is not confirming either transaction, despite the super-high fee in the child.
Thoughts?  (Thanks to all in advance!)
