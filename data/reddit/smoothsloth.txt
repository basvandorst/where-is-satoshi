(B) take the dispute to court and likely lose to Roger
Will never happen, Roger is a nationless man and he will face much difficulty enforcing this international contract through a legal system.

Thank you for making this post. We all recognize the dangers of centralization, yet we allow this small group of developers to wield an excessive amount of influence over the future of Bitcoin.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
The Blockstream hirings represent the first conflict of interest in development. The proposed alterations are best served by the creation of new protocols. Counterparty is a great example of building on the blockchain without altering it. Satoshi predicted Bitcoin 2.0 and built Bitcoin functionality with current and future developments in mind.

Which court will the nationless man Roger Ver be using to settle his dispute? Interesting how he was against the legal system when he owed taxes but now he loves the legal system when it comes to getting paid.

It can. Using Counterparty (xcp)

What about Namecoin and Maidsafe? Namecoin is a mining subsidy for Bitcoin due to merge-mining, we should be supporting Namecoin if anything. Kim DotCom does not need to hijack the Bitcoin movement. I am happy to see anyone get behind cryptography but this is much bigger than one person.

They may have a difficult time securing a new blockchain and the Bitcoin chain may be much more secure and immutable. This is yet to be seen but without an incentive structure similar or better than the reward structure of Bitcoin, the new competing system would be a less secure centralized ledger.

Like I said, if properly implemented. Correct me if I am wrong but what you described is not applicable in this instance because of BTERs wallet setup. They utilize hot wallets to handle withdrawals and deposits. Again correct me if I am wrong but I hope you would agree that a properly implemented Multi Sig set up with administrative Multi Factor Authentication for withdrawals over a defined size would prevent a lot of hacks.

If any future exchange is able to conduct themselves in the uniquely anonymous manner of BTC-E for as long (+- 4 years) I will gladly offer the same recommendation. You are providing an example of false equivalence. Not all operations are equal. Anyways, the perceived reliability of a specific exchange is besides the point. Counterparty risk is inherent to *any* hosted wallet unless the user is utilizing a properly constructed multi sig setup.

What is this?
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:14:49
Yes it is. If properly implemented, Multi Sig and Multi Factor Authentication can make cold wallet hacks nearly impossible. Be suspicious of BTER for their alleged incompetence.

They have run a sound operation long enough to be given the benefit of the doubt. It is an exchange to use if you want to avoid giving out KYC AML information. Of course, with any exchange, do not keep funds in their hosted wallets.

For a few hundred BTC I would believe your premise of taking advantage of hot-to-cold exploit. For nearly $2 million in BTC? Highly doubt it. Why are you giving an exchange the benefit of the doubt if you, a hobbyist, understand the issue well enough to prevent it? I do not buy the premise that it was accidental. 
Priorities when running an exchange:
1. Security of Coins
2. Anything else
It is becoming more difficult to hack Bitcoin wallets due to Multi Sig / Multi Factor Authentication and I believe many bad actors involved with lesser known exchanges are using their last opportunity for a self hack that can be written off to incompetence.

I threw in a recommendation for an extenuating circumstance. The majority of bitcoin users are able to use government approved exchanges and should do so if anonymity is not a concern. It is clear that no exchange should be used as a hosted wallet 
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:32:15
Any constructive criticism? or did you come here to correct grammar today
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:13:40
By benefit of the doubt I mean they do not deserve to be chastised. It is clear from years of hacks that no exchanges should be used except in the manner you described. Very little on the exchange or preform your transaction then withdraw to a safe wallet. I think it would be naive to discount the importance of an anonymous exchange serving a pseudo anonymous technology.

"We do all the possible to protect money of our clients. But you didn’t set two factors authentication, that’s why we can’t be responsible for safety of your account." Support not giving you the answers you want to hear is different than a systemic failure by the institution itself.

I am involved with this emerging technology in part because it is opposed to the widespread anti-intellectualism present in arguments based on authority. Argue with logic not with the perceived credibility of an "expert". Part of "be your own bank" is the ability to understand the technology on a functional level at the very least. You may not be able to read code but take what you know about Bitcoin on a functional level and reevaluate the situation. Then consider that individuals running an exchange are obligated to have a significantly better technical understanding of the technology than you do. When did incompetence become a legitimate excuse?

Were you using Multi Factor for withdrawals?
