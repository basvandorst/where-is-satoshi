@_date: 2014-07-08 09:44:44
Well for one, 
Second, bitcoin is currently nearly instantaneous vs traditional banking that takes 1-4 days.  If 5-10 years from now it becomes a dominate means of currency transaction, slower confirmations will be normal and acceptable, due to the increased trust in the system from the protocol maturing.
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:40:31
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:18:29
Yes, but we are still in the inflationary period of bitcoin, where miners generate 25 coins x 6 times an hour x 24 hours = 3,600 coins a day.  Until buying volume is over that by a factor of 10, we won't see major price changes like you are looking for.
Also, as more merchants come into the scene, the velocity of money will increase, which also will reduce price per coin.

The shared secret is that he knows my address
Once I take the funds out of my mailbox, the blockchain reports the transaction as going to 123 Main St.

(P * T) / V = 2.1x10 ^7
MV = PT (the Fisher Equation)
[Each variable denotes the following](
M = Money Supply, 2.1E7
V = Velocity of Circulation
P = Average Price Level
T = Volume of Transactions of Goods and Services
Price = (2.1E7 * Velocity) / Transactions - [In the year 2140, until then M is increasing](
When M is fixed, BTC Price goes up as velocity increases or as the number of transactions decrease.
Velocity of circulation is the amount of units of money circulated in the economy during a given period of time. The theory assumes that V is constant in the short term.
The number of transactions (T) is determined by labor, capital, natural resources (i.e. the factors of production), knowledge and organization. The theory assumes an economy in equilibrium and at full employment.

The best thing to do is to learn about creating multisig wallets, and bypass the whole "never touched the internet" thing.  Much safer than standard addresses.
But if you should choose to keep with standard addresses, maybe someone can tell me I'm wrong, but you could take any computer that has all the maleware in the world, and setup your bitcoin offline machine.  Once set up, Rip out the WiFi card and NEVER re-connect the machine to the internet. 
As long as you install signature verified wallet software on that machine, then as an offline wallet it should be 99% safe.  Just make sure you do some test transactions first at small amounts.
You could even wrap it in some metal hardware cloth and add a grounding screw to the case to create a [Faraday Cage](

mv=pq does apply to bitcoin, but it is unique, in the fact that M is fixed for the first time in history, without political or government intervention.  So we really have
v = pq, as M is a slowly approaching a constant over the next 130 years
Then with v, there is the potential for the entire money supply to be spent at rate 10 minutes or some fraction there of, which bounds it to a range.  This potentially could also be considered a constant.
So you are left with pq = Constant
Which means, we might finally a have a system where the quality of a good will honestly be reflected by it's price.

At any time a node has an index of all accounts that have coins.  If you spend, the new record created is from your account to the output address, assuming your account has a valid balance to create the transaction.
This then updates the index at the next block, showing your account with zero and the outputs with the coins.  (assuming you didn't send change back to yourself)

The answer is no.  Too much money, and that same amount of money to destroy could just be used to invest in Bitcoin.   Also, if a group did pull off a 51% attack, it would only allow them a short term gain of double spend crap, and they would ruin their position as a primary earner of fees and coins.  So this black swan event will only be a short term blip issue, not a long term destruction of bitcoin issue.  What else concerns you?

In addtion to the challenge behind brute forcing a private key (as others have pointed out), there is also the challenge of making an educated guess at what the public key is.  A bitcoin address is the hash of a public key, so even figuring out your public key is nearly impossible too (assuming you don't spend funds from the address).  
The Private Key creates the Public Key 
The Bitcoin Public Address is a Ripmd160(Sha-256(PublicKey)) **fixed**
Spending funds from an address publishes the public key in the blockchain, and is why it is recommeneded to always use a new address for change when dealing with large balances.

Here's a primary assumption I'm making:  Miners are small fish when it comes to big money.  So if you are a miner with 10M in bitcoin, and you need to sell to pay for your electrical cost, then you have two options:
- Sell on exchange, and drop the price with your large volume
- Sell privately for a premium
No brainer, you sell privately.
Now if you are a big fish, &gt; 100M USD, you play the following game to get in: 
- Buy privately at premium to market
- Dump on market, to depress price
- Buy again privately
- Rinse repeat, until you've accumulated your goal, drive down price with 10% of your 100M
- Then buy on market, with your next 10M, and sell into the wave you create.

You have to mine an actual block, to be able to put information in the blockchain.  Only the miner who finds the next block can add information to the "coinbase".
Your only other option is to put data in the OP_Return field of a transaction.  You can see examples here

For small transactions, zero confirmations are actually okay.  For large transactions a wait should be fine.
Transactions done off blockchain, like through bitpay or coinbase can work differently and have final settlement on the blockchain, and instant POS confirmation.  These accounts work by building a credit model for each customer.  If you abuse this system you are denied an account.

My theory is that it actually is a government program run by some of the best and brightest with good founding father beliefs...Edward Snowden-ish types. 
One primary reason for this belief, beyond the extra nonce data and hash rate limiting is the amount of planning and genius of the initial launch coordinated to the Coinbase message of the genesis block. 
Additionally the Newsweek article has done an excellent job of searing into the general publics mind that bitcoin has a creator and he was found.
Lastly the USA knows the dollar is doomed due to baby boomer liabilities, being the worlds police and the rise of china in a global market.  The US needs a way out of the dollars eventual collapse and bitcoin is the engineered solution.

Inflation is not just a function of money supply.  Currently a large portion of this money is tied up on bank balance sheets.  Since 2007 the Fed pumped money to the banks in the hope they would loan.  They did not, and is why you are now seeing negative interest rates by ECB.  If this money moves at a rate greater than the economy can absorb it, we'll see inflation or deflation.  It's a powder keg, we are just waiting for a spark.

It's recommended not to send coins to an address where coins have been spent.
Until spending, the publicly key is a hash of the actual key.  Once you spend you publish the full public key.
So instead of ripemd160(Sha-256(ECDSA)) you just have ECDSA protection on funds in an address where spend has occurred.
For an address with no spent funds, you could send in funds as many times as you wish.

I don't see bitcoin's primary use as a POS payment method.  To address the issues you raise all that would need to be done is for an exchange like coinbase to offer an address hosted by them as the payment source, and offer the vendor an insurance contract for instant payment risk.  The much cheaper 'merchant' account would be an alternative to typical credit card processing.  Instead of 'bit coin accepted here' you just need to start seeing "coinbase branded bitcoin accepted here" marketing.  
They may already do this, just minus the branded bitcoin message.

Your public bitcoin key starts with a 1 or 3.  You can share this.
Your private key starts with a 5.  I don't think coinbase gives you access to the private key, as you are trusting them to be your bank.
Also remember any address you spend from multiple times is considered insecure.  Addresses were originally designed to be one time spend.  So if your change is going back to the same spend address, know that you are weakening the security of that address.

I think it's simpler to think of all coins existing in the blockchain ledger.  Transactions are just certified statements in the ledger stating who owns what coins.  Wallet software just calculates the total coin balance owned by addresses you hold.  


Yes.  (Does the offline wallet store them - Not really.  The private key remaining unknown to the network, keeps the coins in the ledger under that address.)


No.  You can create a raw transaction, sign it, and then copy/paste that to an online computer, to spend the funds.  In bitcoin-qt, you would use 'createrawtransaction' and 'signrawtransaction' to get the data string you need to publish to the network.  Then on an online node, you'd use 'sendrawtransaction + &lt;string&gt;'.  [Example](

My opinions:
1.- Wallets on PC's have a lot of attack vectors, so I personally wouldn't keep more that $100 bucks there.  You don't have to upgrade, but it's good practice.
2 - The public key is created from the private key.  There is a one to one relationship.  Lose the private key, lose control of that key pair.  According to Satoshi, keeping every wallet you ever generate is a good practice.
3 - I like   Simplest thing is just to push your bitcoin-qt balance to the paper wallet, and not worry about the process of exporting keys.  [You do that via the console.](

I would think one method would be for an accounting software package to be upgraded to have a new third field.  This field would be the hash of all the data in the transaction.  Then the transaction itself would be in bitcoin, and would include the hash as Op_return data.

Assuming they were on a forked chain, and a cutoff internet, the moment they reconnect, the larger fork would be treated as the chain.  Then all transactions in the dead fork would become unconfirmed and the next block would work to re confirm them.  I think coins mined on the fork would be lost.

Post the video as private.
Create a second YouTube acct
Share the video with the second acct
Build a 1 of 2 multisig address with the second key being the encoded user/pass to YouTube
Request payment to the multisig
Spend from the multisig to publish the login details in the blockchain
Publishing your content could be based in a rule, after X payments of Y BTC, the credentials are published
May be complex to do manually, but hire me to script it for you!
Alternatively, post video as unlisted and publish the URL code in the multisig, via second key.

When you spend from a traditional multisig, you reveal all the public keys in the blockchain upon a spend.  If a spend from this 1 of 10,000 looks similar to a current multisig, then that pubkey data can also be just data.  The spend could be a timed release, unlocking that data publicly.  
If that data was Sha256(order-numbers), then it could be a way to mass time release a content system built on top of bitcoin. 
The spend txn basically says, these orders are now valid, to this content system

If an attacker found one key, on one sever, they wouldn't have enough information to spend or even know about the multisig prize money.  I don't see how this could work as a honeypot.  
Your attacker demographic would also be limited to users who understand multisig raw transactions.

In a decentralized system, the storage of data becomes a burden on the nodes.  If there was a way to incentivize them it would be okay, but no one has worked out the math on how to properly do this yet.  We need another satoshi to solve that problem before people are okay with this idea.

You appear to be misunderstanding my question.  Everything is on the bitcoin network.

Not sure why there is so much calling "BS" on this.  I never have cash anymore, and my kids have iPads...so bitcoin has been the ideal way to pay them for chores, and allows them to buy stuff via amazon prime / gyft.  Plus it teaches them about money.   Honestly if I give them cash they spend it faster.  Bitcoin teaches them technically how to place an online order, which is tricky for a 10 year old.

The problem with checks is that it benefits the wealthy.  Squeeze a few more days of interest by delaying payment.  (I used to work for the top 0.1%). Checks really work to your advantage to retain control of funds even after payment.  (Stop payment, no signature, lost in the mail, etc)

Alt coin markets provide a way to measure what users want. Market share moving away from bitcoin is a clear indication of unhappy users.  So I think the overall marketplace is very robust.
@_date: 2016-02-17 10:11:44
Miners solely control the chain market.  It is in their best interest to also go with the best ROI. Their interest are in line with the broader market.
Theoretically you could split and have two chains, but in practice the second chain does not have a long lifespan.  The market will see that one chain has a short lifespan in order to remove uncertainty from the market.
Gavin and Andreas both speak to this.
@_date: 2016-02-24 11:24:13

I would disagree, and say not all ultra wealthy fall into this category.  I worked for 13 years catering to this demographic building them their 5th or 6th 25M mini vacation resort home.  Nearly all of our~25 clients over 13 years we're 500M+ net worth individuals, and our service to them was often their play money release.
So there are people with very high net worths that manage a large portion of their own money and can move 10M-50M with no outside board/team required.
I think the problem is that, there is very little overlap in the demographics of this super small subset of people and those that technically and fundamentally understand bitcoin. 
I've attempted to talk to these people about the topic, and all I ever get is a deer in the headlights outcome...and I'm someone they've known for years and have handled their money as a trusted vendor.  
This response validates to me that I have a very different view of fiat money compared to them.  For them, the existing system works fine....maybe even great.

Pasta used to be sold where a box = 1lb = 16 oz.  Today for that same prior price, you get a 12 oz box.  Most people don't catch the difference.  Do you think CPI does accurate dimensional analysis and catches this trickery?  Fucking no way.  Prove it.  
Orange juice is another example.  1/2 gallon containers used to be the norm.  Now 1/2 gallon is 59 oz vs 64.
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:03:24
You are a fucking moron, completely missing the point.  1 pound of pasta is a standard known quantity of pasta sold in a box.  Also, 1 pound is 16 oz.  ie, one would expect to get 16 oz of pasta when buying a box....but current boxes are sold as 12 oz.  Do you get it?  
Because you obviously won't fucking get it, here's the point.  People are paying the prior price that got the 16 oz, but now only get 12 oz.  So they now get 3/4 of a pound for the price of 1 pound.  
Inflation can happen in one of two ways, price per unit goes up, or quantity per price goes down.  The latter is what we are seeing in the market place, and most people don't notice it because the price stays the same.

Minor semantics comment: a red or a green bar does not indicate a buy or a sell.  All trades occur at an equal buy and sell by two parties.  Green or red bars indicate that the trade occurred at a price higher or lower than the prior period.  Changing the period, can change the bar color for the related period.  
So bars really say, these two parties agreed to trade at a price higher or lower than the prior period.
To attempt to determine direction, you really need to account for volume at each trade.
