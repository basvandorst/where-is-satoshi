But it actually is in some places. It'll only get better IF mass adoption actually happens.
I saw a few terminals where you could purchase Bitcoin when I flew into Amsterdam

He has a point tbh. Major FOMO like November last year could arise again later, but the fact is, if Bitcoin hits let's say 50k this year, tons of people will probably cash out their cryptocurrency for fiat to live a better life, they'd probably leave some cryptocurrency left over but if someone had a million in Bitcoin sitting there, I doubt they'd continue driving a Vauxhall Corsa and slaving around at work everyday (unless they actually enjoy their career I suppose) they'd take some if not majority/all of that out into fiat and upgrade some aspects of their lives.
Then again, you can buy lambos with bitcoin so maybe I'm wrong LOL
