Great video! I highly recommend it for newcomers. Analogies galore to relate it to things that are much more well known and established concepts. If you don't have a better understanding of Bitcoin as a beginner after this video, I'd be surprised.

I can't believe this isn't voted to the top in the past 24 hours! This is HORRIBLE.

Another $25 is at the house, that's why it isn't in the picture. 
Got my mom involved in Bitcoin back around April and now we use it to loan each other USD as collateral. Might as well, I mean, we ARE our own individual banks, after all! ;) 
Lucky me, she gave me $150 worth for Christmas, along with a couple of boxes of delicious White Fudge Oreos!!! :) It's been a great Christmas!

WONDERFUL point. My mother doesn't use reddit, and she doesn't spell the greatest. She's over 50 years old. I'm just a geek and have her and my dad watching Bitcoin from the sidelines although we all have a very decent amount of bitcoin combined. :)
I do understand why you say that. Just because I'm on Reddit, doesn't mean my family is. :) thanks for bringing up that point for me to respond to, though! :)

Thank you! It's an awesome experience considering when I got into it everyone thought I was crazy. Now I'm getting them for Christmas! Haha
Hope your family comes around soon! They'll be forced to if the value goes up much more than it was at it's peak! :)

It wasn't on paper wallets. Mom has a paper wallet that I initially gave her Bitcoin on. We now just trade "receipts" like shown in the picture. 
Don't see any reason to leave a trail of the coins moving around on the chain when we can just as easily keep track of it all on an excel spreadsheet. I just debit her paper wallet balance in the spreadsheet that I keep in the cloud. 
If I ever need the coin, which I have enough of my own to spend that I doubt I will, I can just import her private key and debit it and send the output to a new paper wallet for her. :)

Haha. :) Shes funny. But hey, at least a 51 year old woman is using Bitcoin with her son and loves it!! ;)

So because I'm an early adopter and true believer in Bitcoin, I'm now trying to make it sound more mainstream? 
Sad that people don't think people are using Bitcoin to gain financial freedom by being a "team" in the way I said in my first comment. I really don't care, though. Believe what you want, I'm just thankful my mom gave me this wonderful present for Christmas. :)
Anyway, have a Merry Christmas, troll.
