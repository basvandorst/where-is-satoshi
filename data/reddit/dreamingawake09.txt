Honestly wouldn't be surprised if they already are. Especially since they apparently recruit westernized muslims who are most likely tech savvy and probably know about bitcoin.

Probably, but, there are a good amount of folks who do that.

Dude....that's the last place you want to store that at it.

You're right, problem is, a lot of folks aren't educated on that, and simply drop the dat file with no encryption on it.

Oh hell yeah they'll prefer USD or BTC. If you travel there, its recommended to use USD or EUR because of how worthless the local peso is there.

SR was just the largest, most common marketplace, with the shutdown, it just spurred the growth of the lesser-known marketplaces and now you have a variety of places similar to SR to shop.

Yep, I think it was in the song "Blue Magic" where you seem him counting euros.

Probably more fun to just travel to Colombia with these cheap flight prices and enjoy it there. Plus, it is a fantastic country...

Travel rewards man. *shrug*.

Ah well that explains my circle purchase taking forever to come through.
@_date: 2016-02-08 08:05:07
Yeah my Circle transaction is still pending too....ah just bitcoin things sometimes...
And it got canceled by Circle, and for some reason my account is under review. Oh joy.

Um that's Melenchon, he's a communist. This guy is your status quo neo-liberal.

Ayy doge millionaire here enjoying the hype train as well. Good times, good times.

My fault, you're right.

The socialist party of france is not the socialism you and I know of. If you followed what Hollande has done, he has pretty much been in line with neo-liberal policies. Macron is no different, he is a banker, bankers HATE socialism. His policies of being pro-EU is steadfast neo-liberalism and global economics through and through. 
Melenchon is far more left than Macron, and its why Melenchon and Hamon ran on their own. Those were the two left-wing options, Macron being the centrist, and Le Pen the far-right. I'm not skeptical of this guy one bit, he's just another suit.

That's populism for you. Kool-aid for the truly uninformed and emotional.

Fillon was on track to actually win until that whole scandal happened a few months ago and that pretty tanked him before the first round even happened.
