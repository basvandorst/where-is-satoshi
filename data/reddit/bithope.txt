You didn't even do that dumbass.  You just criticized someone trying to help.

Put some in altcoins like GoldCoin for a less risky bet.  GoldCoin is still under a penny.  It's in the top 20 on coinmarketcap.com and has the most going for it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:38:38
In reality, bitcoin will just borrow the code of anything that is successful.  That is the nature of opensource.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:22:59
Check out GoldCoin the cryptocurrency.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:41:29
Sounds like she wants to support coin validation.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:21:28
You won't make any money mining for bitcoins now. 
If you want to mine, mine for GoldCoins at gldtalk.org.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:43:44
I just gave very practical ideas.  Maybe open your eyes a little.  I want to see Sean's Oupost post some progress on these things.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:32:30
You don't understand how open source works or the necessity of the altcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:25:52
Purist bullshit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:48:45
The problem will be the banks telling the govt what to do.

@_date: 2013-11-19 19:33:22
Good luck getting it to be as useful as bitcoin though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:05:59
You have 1 bitcoin.  You want it's value to rise.  You know this is best accomplished if the bitcoin economy grows.  What can you do?
You have to buy things anyhow, why not but bitcoin first and spend that on the items you need leaving your 1 bitcoin savings account alone?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:25:32
Anything in the top 20 will be the only currencies standing in 10-20 years.  Who wants fiat when you can have something that isn't so easily devalued?
I think they support Bitcoin and answer the question, "Can't I just start my own bitcoin?"  Sure, they are already here.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:13:00
Which essentially means Google paid her to say that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:42:07
There are plenty of altcoins to choose from for low prices.  I like GoldCoin.  It's still under a penny.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:45:47
I would think a miner would know to password protect his wallet.dat file and put it in multiple places.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:43:15
It's waves Teddy boy.  It'll be back and MUCH, MUCH higher.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:57:44
It's not going to happen.  Mine an alt.  I like GoldCoin.
Pick your own from coinmarketcap.com
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:58:28
Geesh guys...come on.  Priced in fiat, sold in btc, converted back to fiat.  Not hard.

You can always trade these coins in for bitcoin or just buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:52:15
No, I clarified.  The point is you can create your own coin but good luck getting it anywhere close to the top 20.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:15:02
Dude...just go relax for a long time, think of yourself writing it down and kind of drift to sleep, see if it comes back up.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:58:22
That won't happen.  Bitcoin is ahead of the curve on all of them in terms of building out it's network.  To give you an example.  The bitcoin nework is 200 x more powerful than the top 500 supercomputers combined.  All of the others don't even make a super computer.
However, I would get a position in some alts as they truly support bitcoin imo.  I have bitcoin, litecoin and GoldCoin as a  big play.  It is currently trading for less than a cent.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:21:20
This is utter purist bullshit.   Check out coinmarketcap.com.
Personally I like GoldCoin because it has a great name, is less than a penny, unique 51% protection and some pretty smart programmers behind it.  Do what you like though.
Altcoins support Bitcoin and answer the fundamental question, "Can't I just create my own coin?"  Sure just try to get it in the top 20.  That's much harder.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:55:54
To the moon.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:30:19
Most people here don't understand open source projects.  There is room from hundreds but only 20 or so will likely be viable as currencies. 
Each one is GOOD for bitcoin as they have code they experiment with that bitcoin can just take (open source) it the code proves its worth.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:37:42
Personally I think it is what it is.  The more apt comparison is the US Dollar to the New Zealand Dollar.  NZD will NEVER be as big as USD.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:26:09
Purist bullshit.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:45:05
Sure we should.  We have the potential to fix it.  It is solvable.  I just told you two ways.  Mike Oehler underground housing...cheap as shit but we need people there that are experts that can help train and earthships...same thing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:59:27
Get in early on GoldCoin.  Each coin is less than a cent and it could go to 10 bucks + in a year.
Check it out at gldtalk.org.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:14:29
Buy some soon and buy a few alts too.  I like GoldCoin. It's less than a penny per coin so you could get 100 for .50 cents.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:32:56
No he couldn't have.  This was the first original question in a while.  STFU.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:06:14
It's not going to move that quickly once the dust settles.  Yes you can make a profit.
Look at it the other way in an inflationary economy.  You build a car for 10k but by the time you build it, that car can be sold for 11k, another month 12k .  Why would you ever sell your car if the value of it keeps going up?
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:13:14
If you still plan to mine, it's too late for bitcoin.  You can mine an alt though.  Personally I like GoldCoin because it is still under a penny, with a great name, unique 51% protection algorithm, brilliant programmers and lots of legroom to grow.
You could keep the GoldCoins or sell them for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:09:35
How many of them you going to make?  Is it more than 21 million ever?  Nevermind then.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:32:05
They are interesting because they actually lend support to bitcoin.  Most purists don't get that.
The likelihood of an alt ever supplanting bitcoin is extremely small.  It just isn't a worry and their code bases can be used by the bitcoin developers if they prove to have merit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:51
Dude...each coin will be worth 100k+ in less than 5 years. 
Your comment has been made time and time again.

@_date: 2013-11-19 19:53:41
Dude, I mine and code.  I know exactly how it works.  When the core developers of bitcoin decide to add something the miners will accept it unless it's of no benefit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:04:57
Nothing wrong with speculators.  They keep bitcoin afloat while we await the real markets like remittance.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:13:38
There are others on coinmarketcap.com.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:16:46
This is pretty much it.  This process keeps it expanding too.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:03:15
It's not real.  Totally fake.  Nothing to see here.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:21:41
me too
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:36:42
This guy DOES NOT get it.  The whole reason bitcoin works is selfishness and greed.  The reason it will be adopted is based on these two things.  Take that away and only hippies with sandals will use it to buy grass to eat.

She's clearly representing Ripple.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:43:30
If the US dollar is inflationary doesn't this encourage hoarding of goods and services as those goods and services will be worth more tomorrow?
