on a scale of 1 to 10, in terms of probability of something going wrong, with 1 being least probable, how do you rate Bitcoin core vs Electrum 2.9.3

Thanks. can you explain why bitcoin core scores more in terms of safety? after i rec. payments to my electrum wallet,
i always make it a point to check the balance on the other block explorers as well. am i doing it right?

Money came into ETH for buying into ICOs. Now that money will get into Bitcoin. BOOOM $7000 BTC

Somebody show this to PBOC and Chinese authorities.
This will only propel the Bitcoin rocket to $10,000 in next 30 days.

4 is too high. would love to see what other guys in the crypto space think of it. I was thinking more in terms of BC:2 EL:3

I think this is massive bullish news for Bitcoin. With ICO status unclear, money will pour into the only true cryptocurrency- Bitcoin. I see $7000 within next 15 days.
