Yes. Propaganda triggers me. I guess I should have out a hashtag warning.

See if you had the mind of a scammer you could have gotten him for $50/$100. You already had him set on getting $8k from you, he would have considered $100 worth the risk - - or maybe convinced him to cover the transaction fee of your $8k by sending first.
Anyhow no need to actually become a scammer--well done.

"just because you keep calling me racist..."
Now you know how I feel.
Wreck our ideals? What? Of freedom and justice for all? True, you would be against freedom for black and brown people, after all you're a Democrat.

Also "Trumplover"... Sounds slightly reminiscent of another favored term of racists, oh right "n*ggerlover". Well at least you're consistent with your racism.

Oh, nice. Well done! I've currently got a guy on ebay trying to encourage me to make the transaction directly through PayPal, but I'm not sure how to mess with him though.

You mean four years of a ceaselessly booming economy, peace with North Korea, and actually running for Americans isn't enough?

Only the American flag, loser. The confederates were Democrats (look at that, they hated our flag then and they hate it now) . Happy Independence Day, you racist!

Everyday use of bitcoin would be the ideal to actually free people from the dependency of corrupt, centralized banks.
Anyone with even half a brain would recognize that you just need to increase block size, but it's not happening because of a few central bitcoin players.
Bitcoin is a ten year experiment which has failed. It has only proven that people are incapable of self government--and don't even want it.

Oh is that all?
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:36:42
Why? OP's original assumption is perfectly reasonable and not foolish at all. It's the tax system that's absurd in this case.
@_date: 2019-10-02 12:49:23
Wouldn't it be a little more apropos to bring this up after it's been proven incorrect? Reddit really seems to love  blowing its load early.
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:17:09


Yes, such a *foolish*conclusion. /s
Reality is the tax ~~laws~~ interpretations regarding crypto are absurd, unreasonable, and should be challenged in court at every possible opportunity.
Before you amend returns and pay significantly more than (possibly necessary), I would wait to see if you're audited and then follow through with the auditing process. Despite what TV sitcoms may show you, getting audited is not the end of the world, nor does it even necessarily result in penalties, nor is it a "our decision is final" process. You can negotiate or legally appeal an audit decision and even invoke a third party for opiniob--all as part of the standard auditing process. All of this takes months and months and if you keep an active line of communication with the IRS (as opposed to ignoring it out of fear) then the process is neither scary nor life-ruining. 
My general perception with questions like this is that posters like OP are kind of afraid of waking up one day to find all of their assets seized and their accounts frozen...which (legally) should only happen after months of attempts at collecting a debt. And even if you DO wake up with that nightmare, much of it can be temporarily resolved with a simple phone call and then an appeals process, and ways to protect assets from being seized.
Don't pay more than you need to: Although the IRS is not  your enemy, they're not your friend either. But do keep in mind that the people you're dealing with are just everyday Joe's and Jane's just following the rules so as not to get in trouble.

What about 2013 - 2017??
@_date: 2019-10-21 13:43:57
Yeah but that doesn't protect you from identity theft, only from the bank going under.
Identity theft is the banking equivalent of getting your bitcoin address hacked.

Ok well this is reddit. So...lighten up.

This is a public forum, responses are as much to OP as they are to the entire audience.

Best time to sell is right now. Because the big drop is coming that will make last year's low look like a sigh of relief.

Yeah same happened to me with Mt. Gox. So I went with coinbase instead.

Truthfully though, when you're in the ivory tower it's easy to convince yourself that the little guy did it to tbemselves. After all, to a degree--they did. They took out loans and credit they couldn't afford.
Thing is, people don't change over the centuries. And the guys at the bottom are the same as the guys at the top: they're all fighting to take everything they can get before someone else screws them out of it.
Only difference is that the guys on the top are able to capitalize on it, whereas the little guys aren't. But if you switched places with them, and gave the little guys the power and the bonuses, it wouldn't be long before even the most righteous reddit or would succumb to the same greed.
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:38:02
Well, since 2011 it has gone up... Astronomically.

This is a bit more complex than just saying "the system doesn't reward that work." it's a combination of a few things.
Firstly you're dealing with a generation of individuals who took out buckets of money for degrees that are more/less unusable. 
You have predatory universities offering anything and everything to soak up the max amount of loan dollars, and a bunch of kids--who either out of stubbornness or lack of access to wise guidance chose to "pursue their dreams" - - a sentiment taught to them from kindergarten onwards.
So bad decisions by barely-adults led to useless degrees + mountain of debt, which comes out to precisely a job at a coffee shop. And there's way more to it than all of that. 
But this idea that you just "blindly work hard" and The Almighty System is supposed to come in and take care of the rest is just idiotic. The "system" so-called is a more/less free one and sometimes that means bad players get the upper hand and the under dogs have to learn to be a bit more saavy (I. E. Genuinely asking themselves the question of "how much does a job in this field realistically pay and how many loans do I have to take out to get it. Is that ratio worth it?). The millennial generation is one that was failed by its seniors and has failed itself.

OP said resistance, not support.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:52:03
It should be noted on the wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-02 07:07:25
Watch what, exactly?
@_date: 2019-09-07 07:54:49
Does the wallet need to sync? Check the public address of your recovery seed on a blockchain explorer, it will show the actual balance of the address.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:49:50
No that's not what I mean. Take the public address and check a block explorer to see the balance.
If it shows a balance on the block explorer but not on your wallet, then your wallet just needs time to sync to the network.
