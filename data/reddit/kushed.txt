$50k investment today will make you average of $250 a week. Show me any other investment that will match this.

Same thing happened to me last week, for an amount of about $220. Contacted support in the following order.
1) MoneyGram - Amount sent - Confirmed
2) Bitstamp - Confirmed Not to have received the amount. Requested Bitinstant Transaction information so they may better assist me.
3) ZipZap - Confirmed that they see the transaction and provided details of transaction including Order ID. Suggested I contact Bitinstant and request for them to process the transaction.
4) BitInstent - No reply since last Friday.
5) Bitstamp - Forwarded transaction information provided by ZipZap to bitstamp in hopes they might have better luck with Bitinstant support.
Still waiting for reply from Bitinstant and Bitstamp. 
UPDATE: Resolved.

Bitstamp also disappeared for a wile. Here is a reply I got from them in regards to the issue.        
"We apologize for not getting back to you sooner. This is not likely permanent and is only due to insufficient reserves held by BitInstant on deposit with us. As soon as they replenish these reserves they will re-add Bitstamp as an option."

They should start referring this as a vending machine instead of ATM. ATMs follow different regulation than vending machines.
We don't want to confuse the regulators, they might create unnecessary issues for does who choose to invest in this.

It was me. Thank you for the two extra bonus keys you have provided for being the first Bitcoin customer.  :)
