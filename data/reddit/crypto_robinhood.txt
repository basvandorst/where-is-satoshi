What do you see when you look inside?

You do not seem to have an answer nor can you show me a place where I can find an answer to my question? Tolerance?

The way the paid trolls work is simple. They are instructed to find any reasonable post and down vote it so that it is not visible. Look at the vote of this post. They are instructed to suppress any article that stands in their way. That is what all dictators do.

The nicest post so far:-))
You are right. There is nothing to be found here.

I wrote a few days ago and I explain it again here. Future market platform is the first real competition to cryto exhanges. CBOE and CME are regulated, audited, and under heavy watch. Crypt exchanges are not. When you look at CBOE and CME, you can see the amount of real cash investment coming to the market. With exchanges, you never know. Having said that, it is hardly a couple of million dollars per day. How that translates to billions of dollars per day on Crypto exchanges?
Plot is simple: Pump the price so that the poor guy is dragged into crypto exchange to buy. Then, either claim you are hacked (Mt. Gox, Youbit, etc.) or grab the cash and run. 
This cannot happen on a regulated exchange platform. That is why such a huge different between these two platforms.

Are you paid to write like this?

What dictators do is to suppress information dissemination by putting people to jail and prosecuting them. What paid trolls do is no different. This is a digital age, man. Here, they will suppress the info instead of debating it in a healthy way. Lets call them trolls for "digital hitlers".

Wow? I did not know I have a candle and I am trying to find an answer to a simple question in this sub. Where are the wise people?
I did not say dip, nor did I say to the moon. I simply said compare the two realities however you like and draw conclusion. What is yours?

I am new to this sub. But I can see real discussions gets swamped with garbages. This is sad. To me, this is another reason why news regarding bitcoin is highly channeled. That is not fair to thousands of people investing in bitcoin.

Here yea, here yea.

Is looking inside the reason people are selling after futures gone out?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:21:07
Yes, and the trolls are preventing this to be known like hitler and all other dictators.

Frankly, I do not think the price rise is due to major investment in bitcoin. The market manipulation is too intense, my friend. Whether it is the whales, exchanges, or else, this is not the price rise due to network effect. Majority are putting down less than $1K in their purchase. How does that translate to billions of dollars? The price is too shallow.

Help me understand better. Bitcoin Cash was forked out of Bitcoin. Now, we have over $25B that did not exist before the fork. Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, and so on. Whoever has one bitcoin would have one bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and bitcoin diamond. We can call it dividend. But it looks like money printed out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:14:34
I agree. But as SKMikey1 explained, you can translate the values of bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and bitcoin diamond to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:11:23
I get your points 100%. But as you said, you increased your BTC holding by 20% selling Bitcoin Cash, and 5% selling Bitcoin Gold. You could have increased them even more if you waited a bit longer letting big players to pump and you sell at higher value. But the point remains the same: Additional wealth was created out of nowhere.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:28:48
I fully agree with you on that. There is some cash coming to the market. We know that due to supply and demand issue, the liquidity never matches the posted value. While bitcoin market value is $148B, the liquidity supporting it is hardly one tenth of it.

It works same way as other forks would. Its beauty is that it uses bitcoin protocol and feels like bitcoin except many purchases are purged and it has started brand new. 
Imagine if one would do it right after Satioshi coins:-))

I totally agree with you. But whether we like bitcoin cash or not is beyond the point. The issue is whoever has one bitcoin owns one bitcoin cash, one bitcoin gold, and one bitcoin diamond, and whatever comes along. It feels the same, it smells the same. Yes, the technology is different. But the end result is the same. No?

Wasn't getting free money after the fork one of many reasons people were buying into bitcoin before the fork? In Fiat, even when printed by government, you still have to exchange it for work completed. Here, no work needed to be completed. Buy before the fork, and you have extra money.
