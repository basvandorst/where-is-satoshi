Is there a way to use Bitcoin to buy stocks? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:18:03
Nope. I just wanted to diversify...

Yeah im guessing a transfer to fiat would mean taxes and fees, so moving to a different investment directly would be great. Thx for the tip

I have a cousin who has a gambling addiction. Sold his house then sold his parents house (he was the only child so his parents had named the house to him already) Fucker was set for life and threw everything away. After he went broke he'd come to us for money and we said we'd only buy him food because anytime he got his hands on cash he'd stroll down to wherever he loses everything.

Abra sounds like a province in the Philippines lol. What other cryptos can I buy in it?

Ok I'll move it bittrex and then afterwards get a hardware wallet. Is that a sound plan?

My understanding is that they will handle both btc and bcc so it won't be a problem. I had actually moved my btcs from coinbase to Bittrex already. Just looking for a good wallet. People had recommended electrum
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:09:57
Where should I buy btcs instead? When will the fork happen?
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:36:29
Noob here as well. I have a small amount of btc on coinbase and some on bittrex. Would it be advisable to move all my coinbase btc's to Bittrex for the time being? When will the fork happen?

Filipino here. The Philippines uses special economic zones in order to attract foreign investment. The idea is basically that companies who set up business in these special zones can utilize tax breaks and provide jobs to the locals. It was widely used for the call center industry.
