Nope, the price is based on supply and demand, thus it can never be over/undervalued. Bitconnect is a scam btw.

Nobody HAVE to spaned their money, but the government sure put a lot of effort to make people spend their money. Just look at Sweden with mass immigration, welfare checks, taxes on things government doesn't want people to buy and government-issued discounts on things the government wants people to buy etc etc..
If you hold a market valued asset, like Bitcoin you'd certainly CAN afford to waste money but you'll think twice if you actually want to do that before you actually do it. You don't HAVE to waste your money but you also don't HAVE to hold your money. It seems more balanced to me.

Best way to accomplish that would be with a currency valued by the market based on supply and demand. We're in the digital age now, computers can easily determine how much of asset A I need to pay for asset B and vice versa. It's easy if asset A can be divided into millions of pieces without trouble.

A society that requires that people use the currency to buy all kinds of useless shit they don't need in order to not collapse is not a sustainable society. That's a society problem, not a currency problem.

If it had to be something productive we wouldn't see Europeian countries paying out wellfare checks just to make poor people buy more shit they don't need. The whole idea behind inflation is to encourage people to consume more.
Bitcoin is not a solution due to it's upcoming deflation (currently 4% inflation in fact which is way more than the USD). Bitcoin could be a solution thanks to it's properties which removes the problems a deflatinary asset usually has.

If I decide to only accept chickens as payment when selling my house, whoever buys it will pay me in chickens obviously. While chickens may be a shitty payment system for you it might be very useful for me if I own a chicken farm for instance.
It's all about what's best for the buyer/seller respective. If you don't like volatility (which exist in any market valued asset) or taxes, you'll sell your house in fiat obviously, even if crypto is technologically better.

Fidget spinners are bad for the environment. It's useless shit that nobody actually needs. An economy that requires shit like that to be produced and sold in order to not crash just isn't sustainable.

More adopition is the key, but fact remains 1BTC is always 1BTC, just like 1USD is always 1USD. The fact that 1USD is always 1USD doesn't make it better than Bitcoin.

They could but they wouldn't. If they wanted to back up fiat with crypto they'll make their own blockchain. More likely they're spreading FUD to lower the price so they can buy cheap for themselves to make huge profit once the price starts to rise again.

A currency with a market-based value will start to lose value once people are getting hungry. Say that you have a bag of gold coins and you've just eaten. While the time passes by and you're getting hungrier you'll be willing to spend more of your precious gold coins just to get something to eat. 
It's basically trading of an asset that holds similar properties as a currency but isn't a currency because it's an asset. Remind me why do we need a currency in the first place? is it the artificial fake value set by a govenrment we want or is it the properties we really want.
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:24:56
Yep, it also takes 120 days for a transaction to completely confirm, until then the buyer can initiate a chargeback at any time forcing the merchant to spend hours trying to prove that they indeed sold or shipped the product or service. If the plastic card turns out to be stolen the merchant pays for the loss. That's why everything is so damn expensive today.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:48:01
I think you're missing the point, it's all theoretical but since you're familiar with 1USD = 1USD then why can't you accept that 1BTC = 1BTC? if you could pay your bills, your supplier, salaries, and tax in BTC as well none of this would have been a problem.
What I'm doing is gambling, not gonna argue against that, all I'm saying is that the income in fiat cover all the costs while the crypto income becomes pure profit. If you're making a low profit per sold item you're just gonna make sure that less customers are paying you in Bitcoin. i.e keep some kind of rate between the two as steady as possible.
My profit per sold item is high, that's the main reason I can handle 25% of my customer base paying in Bitcoin.


Nope, stocks don't have any advantages as a currency over fiat. Bitcoin has many advantages over fiat as currency. The only disadvantage is how the price relates to the USD and that's only because you'll have to pay your bills in USD.

You just cash out enough to pay your bills, unless you can pay them in crypto too. Imagine if you did this during 2017, your January payment would be worth 10x more in December, this year wouldn't be just as fun but at least you would have lot's of savings while waiting for the next big bull run.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:44:36
4% per year in fact, USD has 2% inflation per year if I'm correct.

It's been a common argument against deflation even tho both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies has proper solutions to that problem.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:40:37
One can observe some major deflation during the great depression 1929 but what's the proof of correlation there? If that's really connected then we have a society which requires more and more consumption to survive. Every day the average Joe must spend more of their money, they must buy more useless shit they don't need or the entire economy will collapse. 
That's not a sustainable society. There must be better solutions.

Theoretically it would be possible to create a cryptocurrency that adjust it's price after the USD for instance or in a way you would define as "stable". Problem is that you would have to trust someone, just like with USD. You would have to trust them not to silently rob you of 2% every year. You would have to trust them to not irresponsibly lend out money causing financial crices just like they do with fiat.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with limited supply may be volatile now but a market based value on currency seems like a reasonable future. For a market based value to become stable we need adoption and adoption can only work if merchants accept it as a payment method. Its one of those rock and a hard place situations one could say.
I'm a merchant too and around 25% of my customers pay with Bitcoin, I always hold. Should anything happen to the price, those who pay with fiat will cover the losses. Should the price go up on the other hand I'm offering huge discounts for everyone and enjoy a great profit for myself. I think it mostly depends on how much your profit per sold item is. If it's low, this might not work for you.
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:00:24
In order for Bitcoin to bring all this back people can't have weak hands, when governments, banks and corporations is spreading FUD they want to lower the price so they can buy cheap. Don't sell cheap to them. 
That's literally giving them your money just like you give away your personal information to Google, just like you let the bank handle all of your money and just like you don't protest when your government takes your rights.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:56:29
These kind of proxy payment portals can actually help increase crypto adoption. Crypto is great for individuals and small merchants, not so good for large merchants or governments who are still very depending on fiat currencies. Eventually fiat may transform into something only governments and big corporations are using while everyone else uses crypto as currency and for their savings.

If you're comfortable with the principles of trading assets you won't need a currency the day internet and electricity disappears. Also, fiat money is tied to a nation while Bitcoin is global. The risk of a global power failure are lower than a nation wide power failure.

Without internet or power, we'll just trade physical asset instead. Who says that physical asset must be worthless paper money that the government can print or that anyone can fake. Why not use real asset instead like we did before money was invented. A world without internet and power would be slow and primitive anyway.
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:26:09


I wouldn't blame the "speculation" part since you basically find that in any asset valued by supply and demand. The only difference is that it happens online which means everythnig goes faster which of course will attract recless people looking for quick profit.


Cryptocurrency has many great advantages over fiat currencies. The only thing that eventually could disqualify it as a currency is how it's gonna get it's value. Shall we continue to have a governemnt or central bank that can print as much money as they want or shall we have predictable algrithms doing this for us and a value fully based on supply and demand?
Valueation is an important matter that should be discussed but simply disqualifying it as a potential future currency without technical knowledge is just stupid. Then you're not better than those who blindly beleive in cryptocurrency and hate fiat (if such people even exist, haven't met any).

So you're saying it's a conspiracy when the price goes up as well? What makes you think that?
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:09:53
Bitcoin would not disappear but become inaccessible for a while. It's also an asset rather than the currency which means that people simply have to trade other assets. If electricity or internet goes down all machines will stop working and we're gonna need manual human labor. Farmers would have to hire people to work on their farms and they could get paid in food. We'd have a more primitive but still a working society.
With FIAT on the other hand, if the internet goes down people learn that they have no money and goes into panic. They don't realise that they can trade like in the old days and eventually everything are more likely to collapse.
I'm not saying Bitcoin will prevent a disaster in case of a nation vide power or internet outage but at least it reduces the risks a little.
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:34:01
When an asset starts to drop in value you can either cut losses or hold. Nothing says that one is generally better than the other, although with cryptocurrency through history you can see that cut loss isn't always the best strategy, usually it's better to hold which is why so many suggest exactly that. If you wanna cut losses that's your choice. If you prefer to hold that's also your choice. If you don't want investment advice, (good or bad) then don't listen to them.
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:44:28

A decentralized system won't need an army to win over a centralized system.

Bitcoin is not the same as alt-coins, and just for the record USD is not the same as EUR. Each country has its own FIAT currency, any kid can write numbers on paper and claim it's a currency then hit other kids for doing the same thing. It's primitive and stupid. A forked blockchain, on the other hand, will only get the value people are willing to pay for it.

Well, the current hash rate is 28,300,000TH/s, the fastest ASIC miner, Antminer S9 can mine 16TH/s using a 1kW PSU, that's 1,768,750kW (1.8GW). Assuming that people use the most profitable mining hardware and avoid mining at too much loss it doesn't seem to be too much electricity.  
Comparing to fiat is also kind of ridiculus since there's no number to be found on how much electricity is used. Consider paper money, forest needs to be chopped down, paper produced, armored trucks for transport, secure vaults for protection. The only thing that saves some energy is their centralized servers at the cost of security and transparency.
