I was told by a S Korean friend that it’s just trading sites that are not licensed

They don’t have any mining operations. Their claims of “special mining algorithms software” is unproven and pretty much a lie.  Pretty sure this is a Ponzi.

I have always asked that. I have been in Bitclub for 2 years and have made a ton of money. I own S9’s and use slush pool and make more but the maintenance is a pain in the rear. The mining pool works amazing for me. I can’t maintain the 4 machines I have let alone buy more.

I don’t mind sharing some of the profit so I don’t have to maintain everything. I do both and I like both.

I guess you don’t have any clue what it takes to mine coins.  You can be a believer in them. I was trying to but when I applied the facts and actual math to it it proves they are in fact paying out with the new money coming in.  If the new money would stop tomorrow they would not be able to pay out money in a short period of time.

Mintage can’t mine any faster than all the leaders in the bitcoin industry. Slush, Antpool and others are the best in the industry.  There is no magic algorithms.

Lol perfect

Who is paying you this interest ? Where are they getting the money to pay that? 
I am not sure if you understand economics.  Mintage mining started in October. They are not magic. They can only mine so many coins and process so many blocks. They are not listed on Blockchain so where are they getting their mining from?? Magic mining pool??
They have no equipment. Or they would show up on BLOCKCHAIN

How?? How can 1000 turn into 1 million??
If you owned your own mining machines.  You couldn’t make that with the best machines in the planet. 
Slush pool will pay out 950 a month with a Antiminer S9 ( 4500.00 unit). So let’s use their multiplication idea. 
5 months you have 2 
7 months you have 3 
9 months you have 4 
11 months you have 5 
12 months you have 6.  At this point you are making 5500 a month
13 month 7 machines 
14 month 8 
15 months 10.  Now 10 k a month 
16 months 12 
17 months 14 
18 months 17.  So 17k a month and that’s if you could actually get your hands on more machines.  It’s virtually impossible. No one wants to sell them and they are months behind on production. 
So after 1.5 years you are making 18k a month.  And that’s with the fastest, best performing system on the planet.
