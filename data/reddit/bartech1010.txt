And how do you know that they don't crate imaginary wallets and send votes from them. Best solution to this problem is to stop voting for this crooks. We don't need them, they need us.

Yes there is, now when you can create money from thin air and all many need to be invested in something otherwise they will lose in value you get stupid investments witch don't came from savings but from mombo jumbo fractional reserve banking. 
Investment that don't come from real savings give false predictions that there is enough resources in economy to support them all. First you see omg there is so much money everything goes up, new investments, new houses and prices go up, all give good profits. But at some point market will reveal that there is not enough resources, that this 'easy money' distorted real market prices and then comes correction and bubble burst.
There will be no housing bubble with bitcoin. You can't eat biscuit and have biscuit, but with today model they pretend you can.

This leak is f* bullsh*t
On one hand you got sum of all users balance and on the other your BTC in cold + hot wallet, how can you miss 750k coins? you can lose 100,1000 and figure out something is going on. But you want to tell me that he resends all those coins due to transaction malleability? And did notice that when only 2K left in his wallet? Don't try to make me an idiot!

* **1) How you can lose 750,000 and don't notice that?** Do you all believe in this sh*t? If Karpeles just sum all users balance and compere it with what he got in his cold + hot wallet is clear how things are going. What do you think how many coins can you lose before you notice that something is wrong? 750K? WTF!
* **2) Whole Bitcoin Community with Erik Voorhees on lead tell you to act like nothing happened** "For all of you who lost money, my heart goes out to you" Where is Mark Karpeles what he's got to say about it. Do we just let him go with all this money? His name just vanished from press, now it's just MtGox - imaginary entity with no people behind it. Or maybe it was all planned: Mark is just one of you, and now you are all richer by $ 8,000,000,000?
* **3) If you don't want regulations form government why not make ones by bitcoin community** Like for exchanges - they have to show their balance in BTC in blockchain and if not inform people that this exchange is not transparent and should not be trusted.
* **4) We don't have any tools to prevent this in future** We can't prevent this from happening again and we can't look for any kind of justice when this things happen. This is just dreamland for scammers with no repercussions whatsoever.
People don't be mislead. Think for yourself.
I've done the math and 2+2 ≠ 5
But forget the past, forget about Gox and Mark tomorrow is another "better" day. Sun in shining. Cheers.

Hoarding money to what point? Indefinitely? Yes we will all keep our money and wait for prices to fall till we all starve to death. This logic got no sense, this is not how people behave. We want staff now. I want my coffee today. You buy new laptop today, but why? Why not wait, as we all know, when you wait 18 months you will get two times faster computer for the same price. 
I don't say that people will not save money. They will save money but as savings grows some of them will start to think, i got so much cash i need to invest in something. And now you have real investments baked by real savings, not another market bubble caused by loose monetary policy (a.k.a. money from thin air).

Intrinsic (belonging naturally) value is a very wrong term. Nothing has value in itself, value is subjective, humans value things and from the sum of all evaluations come market price of this good. 
Lets say i'll offer you one gallon of water or one pound of gold, which one will you chose? I think all of us will chose gold. But what what will you chose if you are in the middle of the desert?
Stuff don't have any value in itself, we give them value so "Intrinsic value" is very misleading term

There will be no loans as we know today. Loans for consumption will look totally different. It will be in seller interest to sell stuff today rather then tomorrow, he will know the longer he keep things on stock, the less value they will have. So for goods that are more expensive like houses this will have huge implications for developers and real estate agencies. It will be in they interest to sell as quick as possible. If there in not enough buyers with this kind of money, they can sell house today but you pay in installments and this installments can be less every year, or they can wait year, one two or more to find someone with cash who will pay whole price upfront, but till that time price of real estates will fall too so they will profit less.
Also claim that you will earn less and less every year is not true. In this scenario when you have fixed amount of money (21 million in case of bitcoin) deflation only come from increase in productivity, new technologies etc. But as today in western countries workforce is not increasing at all. Population in Western Europe is declining and getting older. So this means there will be less hands to work, less supply means higher price for work. 
Deflationary scenario is 1000 times better for average Joe then today rip off, get rich banksters fiat money system.

What's wrong with deflation? Isn't it good when price of goods fall?
