Universal Basic Income, when a group of participants is able to live on the little profits they make yearly from the increasing price of Bitcoin while working on other open ideas benefiting the masses and progressively transforming outdated working principles of the existing financial and cultural systems to new open, creative, collaborative ways of combining the human intelligence for the common good of the planet to start with. And, of course, the first accepted currency on Moon and Mars.

Great work valentin, simple and nice website that uses bitcoin and allows artists to earn the living. Well done!
As for those wondering how art is priced, have a think about this:
How much would you pay for an object that gives you many pleasant emotions such as feeling of happiness, comfort or brings up memories of best time of your life, or gives you a hint on better understanding of the world each time you see it? Would you pay what you normally earn per hour, per day or may be even per month? 
Some people see art this way and they are happy to pay 7.5btc to get their new “gadget”. Especially if it just takes 1hr to earn 7.5btc.

Google is not in charity industry, unfortunately. The only reason they have not done anything with Bitcoin yet is that they are working hard on figuring out how to make most money out of it and have every user by the virtual balls for the rest of his/her life. 
And then more by using collected data until the next apocalypses. 
And even after that I am sure that there will be tiny little google server flying around the planet in a satellite waiting for the next round of species to evolve for its perusal of doing “no evil” and not much good as well.

To be fair, PayPal is not a payment protocol and bitcoin is not a company. I am sure new brave world will bring companies built around bitcoin protocol that will decide to charge fees. 1% is already a norm, plus exchange rate fees that no one like to mention. It is up to us as a community what we deem acceptable and what we are going to do about it. Don’t like PayPal? No one is stopping you to build something better and cheaper (using bitcoin or not).
And yes, I don't like PayPal sneaking in more fees. I think there is no rationale behind it, but just a “want to get more”.

Bitcoin dollar value correlates similarly to the value of shares in a ponzi scheme. Nothing new in this statement. Think if you buy now and value collapses due to a fork then how much will you get back? Same as you would in a ponzi scheme, unless you are in the queue to get your money back, while everyone else is in a queue to buy.
Same is true for the national currencies, although this would not be mentioned in the letters to the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
Bitcoin was created to solve faults attributable to the human character (corruption, financial system design). Interestingly enough, its popularity is driven significantly by the same side of the coin (greed, desire for a quick buck).
Bitcoin will function just fine if its value was stable. It will be, actually, a more robust, but more boring system as well. How much are you excited by the price variation on internet access?
I think the future of the technology lies in much more than we have it now with bitcoin. Imagine if it can be pegged to some tangible value. Say a kWh of the generated energy that can be traded and transferred easily. Wouldn't it be great if energy producers (miners) were incentivized to optimize efficiency of the solar panels or hydro generators making clean energy more accessible and cheap?

Yes, your bank will earn on currency conversion and international transaction fee as you would probably want to transfer USD and not AUD (more liquid market, smaller spread). Then MtGox's bank will take a cut as well. Around USD 140-150 sounds like a good guess or 170-160 AUD.

I am pretty sure that was misheard for [Brown Stamps]( 
A popular marketing practice employed by many stores in post-World War II US was the distribution of stamps with each purchase. The number of stamps given out varied with the amount of the purchase. These stamps were collected by customers and later redeemed for household gifts. The earliest of these stamps were brown in color and known as "brown stamps" or "brown points." The relationship between a purchase and the collection of these "brown points" equated with **doing a good thing (supporting the local vendor)** and **getting a bonus** (the valuable stamps).

BIP: 38    
  Title: Passphrase-protected private key    
  Author: Mike Caldwell    
  Status: Draft (Some confusion applies: The announcements for this never made it to the list, so it hasn't had public discussion)    
  Type: Standards Track    
  Created: 20-11-2012    
     
A method is proposed for encrypting and encoding a passphrase-protected Bitcoin private key record in the form of a 58-character Base58Check-encoded printable string. Encrypted private key records are intended for use on paper wallets and physical Bitcoins. Each record string contains all the information needed to reconstitute the private key except for a passphrase, and the methodology uses salting and scrypt to resist brute-force attacks.
The method provides two encoding methodologies - one permitting any known private key to be encrypted with any passphrase, and another permitting a shared private key generation scheme where the party generating the final key string and its associated Bitcoin address (such as a physical bitcoin manufacturer) knows only a string derived from the original passphrase, and where the original passphrase is needed in order to actually redeem funds sent to the associated Bitcoin address.
A 32-bit hash of the resulting Bitcoin address is encoded in plaintext within each encrypted key, so it can be correlated to a Bitcoin address with reasonable probability by someone not knowing the passphrase. The complete Bitcoin address can be derived through successful decryption of the key record.

When traffic in a city became too heavy, city council introduced a fee for every car driving into a city. Traffic dropped. They did not try to ban people getting into cars or suddenly changing keys for some of the cars. 
Miners should be regulating this, "the roads that cars drive on", depending on amount of traffic they can handle. Not the car manufacturers or locksmiths.

The idea as I understood it is to create an anonymous infrastructure allowing you to be online without revealing too much of a personal information. E.g. shop with Amazon without giving out your credit card details and address, send encrypted messages, skype etc. I think the concept is great. The shares are basically a way for founders to get money and have idea worked on. Risky? Yes. Scam? Too early to tell.

dacoinminster, I am sure you are onto something, yet I don't see a clearly defined problem to solve. Is there one or is it R&amp;D? I suggest you hold 1hr brainstorming session. Put an aim to list all the problems that bitcoin currently has. As many as possible, but valid problems. Then, just another quick one, is to go through the list and put an importance rating to each of those. And the last of 3 steps would be to select the problem to solve (or two) and dedicate time to it. Here is [a topic]( I created for the 1st step. Hope you that helps.

Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given socio-economic context or country. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment. Any kind of object or secure verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered [money](

@_date: 2013-12-13 23:35:27
Well, why not? Bitcoin is a great technology, but if you look into it as an investment it very well could be a ponzi scheme. You sell your bitcoins to other people who enter the market (new capital) and everyone talks about high returns of Bitcoin. What do you think the price of BTC will be if everyone will decide to cash out? Will all the investors be able to get the price they paid?
    
"A [Ponzi scheme]( is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from existing capital or *new capital paid by new investors*, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation. Operators of Ponzi schemes usually entice new investors by offering *higher returns than other investments*, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent. The perpetuation of the high returns requires an ever-increasing flow of money from new investors to sustain the scheme.    "
    
The only difference is that Mr Ponzi is a distributed personality in the likes of Kieser and others.
