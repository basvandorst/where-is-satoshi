You got it in the last part. Some people need capital asap or they dont believe it'll go back up.
Look at Blackberry, Xerox, and Kodak's stock history. Hodling through your losses would have been a mistake if you bought near the high.

Because no one here wants to believe they could be bag holders.

They think that because it hit that price before, that it will hit it again. Even though case studies like Blackberry stock are contemporary counter-examples. This is how bag holders are created.
Sorry, I mean bag hodlers.

This is a shit argument. Railroads, Biotech, and Internet were all world changing developments and still had massive bubbles that created a fuckload of bag holders when they popped.

Just hold on tight for a few hours, could just be a delay. Has there been any updates?

Nothing would make me happier than BCash getting delisted from Coinbase. Shitcoins belong under the bridge, with the other trolls.

Three weeks ago: "Don't sell at 14k, it'll go back up"
Two weeks ago: "Don't sell at 12k, it'll go back up"
One week ago: "Don't sell at 10k, it'll go back up"

Agreed. Only thing HODLspammers are holding are bags.

There are so many people purposely bagholding and unironically using technical analysis.

Everyone with SPY Calls (so all of wallstreetbets) is going long on $ROPE

Technical Analysis is all bullshit. For every correct bear/bull signal from TA, there's probably like two other ways to TA the same chart that gives the opposite signal. When you're worse than a coin toss, just save yourself the effort and read a horoscope.

Now I'm sure that If BTC hits $1, there's gonna be people saying "We're still 10x from 2010".

Nobody wants to believe they're bag holders. In fact, I think most people here would rather become bag holders than sell at a loss, which shows a striking immaturity.

We're not even past Concern tbh.

The news has been out for a while. It's already priced in.

Any crypto sub is sunk cost fallacy everywhere. My personal favorite quote to mock is "it's only a loss if you sell".
