My problem with this is that I don't believe you have a "fundamental human right" to another persons services. Healthcare is a service just like the internet, you don't have a right to access someone else's labors or products. Its an entitled way of thinking.

That's fair. I don't plan on using it long term, but it's a good place to start imo

In what way does internet fit the same bill? It is not required for you to live, or even to make a living. I'd also like to bring up the fact that none of this was a problem 3 years ago before NN was implemented. In regard to the oligopoly point, it is a falsehood to believe that there are not commonly other similarly priced options for ISPs. Now yes there are instances where that is true, however that happens often due to zoning laws enforced by the government, wherein ISPs are working with local government to prevent competition. This would imply that less government interference means more competition. There are many many more options that just aren't as big as Comcast, so you don't hear about them. I've lived in big cities in the past, and I live in a small town now, and yet I have always had choices in which ISP I use, and often times the smaller companies provide me better deals because that is their way of securing business. Government intervention is beneficial to prevent monopolies from occurring, but what about when the government creates monopolies out of utility companies like electricity and water? If Internet "fits the bill" as being the same as water and electricity, what stops the government from installing Comcast or another ISP as an ISP monopoly just like they have with other utility providers?

You are aware that net neutrality is only 2 years old right? And I care if it were to affect me, and I had to pay for certain websites for example, then darn that's disappointing but I'd rather that than an overreaching government. Your problem is that you're entitled and think people deserve to have the internet just for being alive.

Ya that's exactly what it means. Your only argument is "its going to be expensive" which is a claim you've yet to support. Internet service is not and should not be the governments problem or business. You do not have a right to a companies service.
If a corporation makes money, as long as fraud is not involved, any trade is mutually beneficial. A corporation making money provides incentives for the company to continue providing the service that a customer is willingly paying for. That is beneficial to both parties.

How is it bad? Giving a company the ability to regulate the service they provide is bad? It's their service. If you don't like how they provide it, find another company.

How many times do I have to say this, INTERNET SERVICE IS NOT A RIGHT. If you can't afford it, too fuckin bad. And this doesn't protect me from shit other than having to pay more, which isn't the governments job. I was perfectly fine before net neutrality, and I'll be perfectly fine after net neutrality.
And to reply to your newest comment, why do you think my bill is going to double? Or anyone's bill for that matter? It didn't change when NN was implemented, why would corporations suddenly do it this time? And honestly why is helping corporations a bad thing? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:58:02
How was your service before 2015? Fine? That's what I thought. And honestly I don't give a shit if you only have one option. That doesn't give the government the right to regulate a companies product and the way they serve it. You don't have a right to internet service just because you want it. It's a privilege and a luxury 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:24:29
Ya actually it is. What is net neutrality protecting other than having to pay more? Are people in danger? YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO THE INTERNET. The government should keep citizens safe, and allow for an open, free, capitalist market. Net neutrality doesn't do that. I'm sorry if I don't want the government holding my hand through life, and I'm sorry you feel the need for that.

Then why are you defending NN? You're literally saying that under NN, this will become a monopoly empowered by government regulation. Is that what you want?
And this may shock you, but I believe things like roads should be privatized, but again that's a tangent. Police could not be privatized obviously, however they are required to uphold the laws set in place by the government. In that fashion, you could make the argument that police actually are necessary to live and work.
Smaller providers do compete because of their discounts. That's why I'm currently paying a smaller provider. And again I agree there are large barriers to entry, but those are caused by big ISPs working with local governments to regulate the industry in their favor. Less government intervention would prevent that from happening.

And? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:41:17
I'll stick to nn to avoid rabbit trails, and yes you are correct in the makeup of the internet, but you're forgetting that the ISP providing access to the internet is a service. You can't have a right to someone's services. If ISPs weren't there, and you could connect directly to the internet from your computer, then yes you should be able to access it as long as you have a computer. But unfortunately we need ISPs to connect us to the internet, which again is a service.

Dude you've been constantly bitching that you and the poor aren't going to be able to afford internet now than NN is dead.
"but they can if they want." So....were they being restricted before? Cause if they weren't as you now say, what now would make them increase prices rather than before?
"Accused" is a pretty important part in the title of that article.... Either way lets assume they did it since they did respond to the claim, the existence of this article is proof enough that those types of practices are frowned upon, and the company takes a hit when that behavior is discovered, which provides incentives for them not to throttle services.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:41:12
If its too expensive, buy Comcast lol. You have options, you just don't like them. Too bad. Its not your right to have someone else's service exactly the way you want it.
And you've failed to refute my point that companies have incentives to not throttle service. Essentially I've now asked you to show me why companies would have an incentive to raise prices now when they haven't in the past, or throttle service which companies have gotten shit for doing in the past. You've been unable to support either belief.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:15:19
Then why would they raise them now that NN is dead? You now claim that they aren't having their prices restricted in the first place, but that they would raise them if they weren't restricted? Which is it? And again, they didn't throttle anything before NN, why do you think they will now.

If you'd like to learn more about the perspective of privatizing roads, take a look through this article. Honestly it's just too much for me too type cause I'm lazy lol.
I am familiar with the principal but fail to see why you bring it up?
By the way I really appreciate the civility of this conversation. It's refreshing to not have a debate degrade into character attacks and name calling. So thank you :)

Lol I figured you did, just checking. I was rather confused at the sudden change of direction there
