Here is an interactive map that has every ATM you can find in the U.S. (presuming you’re located in the States):

That’s awesome! Hope that his insight will shed some newfound interest into your peers. Let me know if you have any other questions, I can try to answer to the best of my abilities.

I don’t believe so, but I can’t recall off the top of my head. My gut is telling me that you have to set two separate (one for the high and another for the low).

Based on your prior comments in other threads, you seem to be in high school...not going to put much trust into your reasoning here kiddo.

WU-TANG FINANCIAL SAYS HODL YO’ DAMN FUNDS.

Best thing I can recommend is to dollar cost average your purchases. Are you familiar with this by chance? As for best place to buy, where do you live? And what type of wallet are you planning to use (I.e., desktop, hardware, paper)
Don’t worry, these aren’t “noobish” questions if you’re truly interested and have people who are truly looking to help you learn more.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:22:09
As would I! Would be an amazing opportunity.

Andreas is the king of explaining anything and (almost) everything BTC related, IMO.

I agree with DJB, but...if I had to offer any sort of “trust” to a software wallet, I would say Exodus. Best thing you can do is narrow down to 3-4, do extensive research on all of them, then decide which you like most.

This might help you out, I didn’t read all the way through but seems like it should have all of your info:
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:50:27
Ahh, you are correct. Definitely something to keep in mind! Thanks for catching that.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:19:06
You are 100% correct...people will always (in damn near every country) find a way around a “ban” if there ever is one. People are just getting jitters and selling due to this. Trust the process and HODL.

Agreed, as much as I would love to see $1,000, it’s highly unlikely. But, crazier things have happened in the world. Remember, Golden State was up 3-1. ��

To comment a little further on this...the level of security you wish to keep with your wallet may warrant some different recommendations. You could take a look at a Ledger Nano S (will cost you some money), you can also try out Exodus, they are a pretty great desktop wallet from my experience.

Just means hold, and don’t sell for a considerable amount of time.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:36:18
That’s great to hear! Hope that more and more professors (even high school teachers) come around and touch on this subject. ����
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:34:23
Let’s hope we see this again in 2018. But more importantly, I hope we see more information geared to individuals who are not well-versed in cryptocurrencies. If not, I have a feeling that people will start to get burned by coins that aren’t all they are made out to be.

Although I don’t trade (HODLr), I’ll provide you some links:

Kind of depends on what you’re looking to cover for them! He also has a great book that he wrote called “The Internet of Money.” 
But, these videos might be the best starting points:
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:13:05
To be honest and fair minded, I recommend giving both a try so you can see which you like more. I personally just really enjoy the layout and “smoothness” of Exodus. But in saying that, I must disclose that I’ve never used Blockchain before.
One thing I will always say though, and I can’t stress enough, is to NEVER leave your portfolio on a purchasing platform (such as Coinbase). It’s just simply never safe to do so, although places such as Coinbase are reputable places to buy from.

Also, if you run into a situation where one of them wants to read his book, I’d be more than happy to ship my copy to you, and you are more than welcome to keep it and share it with others.

When I read the title of this, I was literally about to comment: “WHATEVER YOU DO, DON’T FALL FOR TETHER!!”..glad I read your post though. It is definitely a blatant scam.

All the banks launder money every single day (whether they know it or not)..where are the charges against them? ��
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:38:27
Whatever you do, don’t get a single bit of news from Nick or Trevon James. If you do get news from them, do the opposite of what they recommend. ��
