What does that even mean?! You're saying there's a way to transfer BTC with zero fees? If so, why isn't everyone doing it? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:38:51
I think he knows that if more regulation comes into this space, he'll loose money.
I doubt he has any moral ideas whatsoever. He's just a greedy POS.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:47:41
Seriously? You're comparing the start of Amazon with BTC? Please explain how they are similar. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:41:16
I don't mean credit cards. It's rare that people use those here in Sweden. We use cards linked directly to our accounts so over-spending isn't possible.

He doesn't HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:45:38
Like I said in a different reply, convenience is key for mass adoption. No matter what the system looks like, transactions need to be as quick as VISA, cost less and provide a reasonable level of anonymity. Otherwise, why even make the switch from fiat for everyday use?
The entire point of Bitcoin is to have a currency that frees people from the confines of banks and a centralized monetary system. In order for that to happen, people have to start **using** it. This needs to be kept in mind when designing it, that's all I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:51:08


Sounds like a huge hassle to be perfectly honest. When is the last time you actually took money out of an ATM? I haven't owned actual cash in years simply because it's a hassle. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:52:25
Ok. Well that's fine. As long as, like I said, it's not owned and/or controllable by a single entity. That entity could very well end up being a government or nefarious business one day. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:29:30
I started buying then. Sold/re-bought in stages after that. Unfortunately I needed the money after a while and needed to liquidate into fiat. It was at $3000 then.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:53:34
The big ones will be run by companies, no doubt.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:02:48
I mean that a node must have at least the amount being transferred through it, in order to make the transaction happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:14:25
The cool thing with that, is that it would actually be completely possible to still use BTC at that time, since it's divisible down to 8 decimals. 0.00000001 BTC is **only** €0.002.
Kinda cool imho.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:31:43
Yea but the price has to stabilize somewhere. And that somewhere could equal €2000 for all we know. Buying in at €12000 would suck balls then.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:38:13
So many are asking this question. I have yet to hear a decent answer.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:09:36
Nerdy? He looks like average Joe the Plumber to me.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:00:41
Nope, no fee for using it. A fee is actually not allowed by law. This is to promote the use of cards instead of cash, thus lowering the chance of robbery in stores and whatnot.
And control, I'm sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:11:55
Yea I agree it's insane. Having trouble cleaning it up though.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:34:21
"you can choose". Yea, but in order to use one efficiently it needs a LOT of bitcoin on it. I.e, only wealthy holders will be able to run a node successfully. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:00:23
Sounds a lot like one of the services a bank provides, tbh.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but I'm wondering if this is something that should be put on top of bitcoin itself? I mean, VISA isn't put on top of fiat currency, it's a way to handle it - supported by investment from a company out to make money. LN isn't supposed to be that. I hope.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:01:34
€14 500 -&gt; €11 100 is a massive dip. Sure it could dip even more at one point, but that doesn't change the fact that it is quite massive right now too.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:24:25
And why is it not more widely adopted? Must be a good reason no?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:40:00
It WAS at that point for a short while, at least on Kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:45
"just wait".
Yea, investors love promises like that. Or, not. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:42:39
I, along with 100% of people in the world, prefer convenience. Perhaps not in every single case (neither do I,) but most of the time in order to live my daily life - yes.
And if you want Bitcoin to truly be every man's thing, convenience is a **must**.
I want Bitcoin to become that.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:29:13
Doesn't address the issue with the emergence of hubs though. With LN we'll all be dependent on wealthy hubs (I.e. companies or individuals) whom could exert power over the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:41:19
Yea but... an LN node IS like a bank in the sense that in order to operate efficiently, it needs a lot of BTCs in order to "secure against the network", right? If that's not true, then I need this whole thing explained to me again. If that is the case however, doesn't it also mean that we'll eventually be dependent on wealthy nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:52:42


But... that's crazy. I should be able to take a fistful of cash from the large pile at any time without any issues. Anything else is just adding management issues to everyday life.
I sure hope your analogy is incorrect.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:49:09
Ah ok I see. Thx.
I don't use Coinage myself and have been lucky with fees on kraken so far, but these things are interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:53:44
Isn't this "Lightning Network" outside of the chain? And essentially owned by some entity?
I've been away from this for too long I think. I'm all out of the loop here, but that is what I've heard and it didn't exactly sound like a **good** thing. Last time I checked, the whole point of BTC was to eliminate centralization of currency?
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:26:18


Amen to that. That shit scares the fuck out of me. We'll all be dependent on wealthy people essentially. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:03
The fees have been too high for too fucking long. I remember when there were promises of virtually free transactions. I for one, am not surprised that BCH is gaining some traction, especially since the bitcoin.com guy switched over and it went all over the news. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:48:15


Nodes will have customers? Hmmm, sounds like running a good node will be a business then?..
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:06
It's secure in some ways, not so secure in others. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:33
I'd be surprised if reddit isn't ONE of their sources for ibfi/rumors though. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:25:37
Anyone else super scared during this massive dip? I know I am... I bought the dip, but I certainly didn't expect it to drop yet ANOTHER €2000 (at this time it's at €11 100).
BCH is soaring (kinda) and the actual Bitcoin is dropping like a dead fly. It's scary. And weird in a sense.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:42:36
I would have wanted to be that guy who bought BTC for let's say $100 and just "forgot" about it, because it wasn't a big investment. Then I'd just find that wallet today...
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:35:35
I'll be sure to set up pruning as well. What does it do, exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:08:09
I also think BTH looks very promising, however it's just as volatile as BTC is at times. 
I sold off all my BTC at nearly 4000 euro. Then, as Kraken was having issues, I decided to move the fiat to my bank. And now they're sitting there, awaiting Coinbase verification. I'll probably go half/half btc/BTH as it stands right now. 
And yea, LN looks like a way to bring transactions off chain and into a network supported by business and venture capital. No thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:54:54

@_date: 2017-08-13 21:46:55
No, but any change that comes that'll last, won't be from the crypto community. It will be from Govt. Govt will never let the people control the money or its valuation.

@_date: 2017-08-18 11:30:18

@_date: 2017-08-16 16:25:59

@_date: 2017-08-18 11:29:12

@_date: 2017-08-15 11:31:02
Good question.
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:27:11
I'd say so, yea. Regulation means more widespread adoption. And more will follow I'm sure. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:33:36
Why? There's a fuck ton of things there, I doubt it's very interesting.

My dad actually started reading up on it a little while back, after I told him I would not help him invest a single penny unless he learned about it first.
It's worth noting that this is the same man who calls me to ask how to attach a file to an email. An email he then sends to me.
It was a damn meme.

@_date: 2017-08-15 16:09:41
Probably, but no1 really knows. It's a combination of difficulty, energy prices, possible hashes/sec/watt and so on. 
That was quite unrelated to the supply/demand question tho. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:13:14
Supply doesn't drop when 21mil BTC has been mined; it just won't go up ever again. If demand rises like it has up til now, it will go up considerably.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:35:15

@_date: 2017-08-12 20:33:27
Those aren't books. Those are hard drives.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:24:15
Is there a way to download the entire blockchain up to a certain point, install that and then just sync changes? Last time I actually ran a full node, it spent DAYS syncing, and had only gotten to about 20%. I just the thing down because I'm sure there was something wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:17:47
Okay, but that doesn't explain the talk about ASIC cards. Those surely were not a thing back then?

@_date: 2017-08-16 14:18:03
How does that usually end? Because you know, govt has napalm and nukes. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:05:03
That would be a very weird address. Impossible, even.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:36:46
Are you seriously looking for some trading formula that "just works"? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:01:38
Ok so, I'm what average Joe would call "technically inclined". I build custom linux servers from the ground up, code Python and bash, and I'm sure I could use Calc to make a budget sheet. I.e, I'm not a 75yo retiree who needs help attaching a file to an email, nor am I a 17yo who thinks having a Terminal app installed on my iPad makes me a hacker.
That being said, I do not fully (or even partially, actually) grasp the implications of the various things proposed.
All I want, is for Bitcoin to become a viable option for a currency. That is NOT the case as of today. There's a reason VISA can charge money (very little, btw) for transactions they facilitate - it's instant. Bitcoin is anything but instant.
So instead of arguing ideology, let's just determine what the goals are and then work together to find the best solution.
Haha, that's funny because it'll never happen. It's a utopian idea. Because there are lots of money to be made in Bitcoin these days, corporate interests have infested this community to the point where I have no idea whom to trust. The "power players" in this space are able to use their much larger technical knowledge and money in order to further their own agenda. This sub is **no different**. This goes back to me not being technically knowledgeable enough to call people out on their bullshit - I simply don't understand what Option A or B would mean, and so there's no way for me (or most of us here, I think) to make a properly informed decision on these things.
So we're left with following our ideologies, but where do those originate? Probably from the person we talked to first. I.e. if you come from slash r slash btc, you agree with those. If you came to first, you tend to lean in whatever direction this sub is heading.
I'd love to be proven wrong though.

@_date: 2017-08-12 19:32:28
Yea, probably. To be honest, Time invested has yielded more (percentage-wise) gain than any job previous, and I make pretty good money. I've been really lucky when it comes to btc though, I claim no real knowledge, just a hefty interest.

@_date: 2017-08-15 19:23:17
About 100 euros to go before I break even on the last trade, so yea. 
I'm not worried in the slightest actually, I just realized my mistake and hope that others can avoid it in the future.

In other words, you:
1. Invested over 1.6 million dollars on Bitcoin
2. Started trading Altcoins for some quick profit
3. Were very happy with making 10k in a day
4. Started losing everything.
There are two explanations here:
Either you inherited a large sum of money and you aren't versed in dealing with it, so you invest poorly. This is also why you were so happy with 10k gain even though you stood to loose a fuck ton more than that. Poor people think this way, not someone who can afford to invest 1.6 mil in a massively volatile market like BTC.
Or, you are lying.

There is ALWAYS a pull back. It's inevitable. It'll come back and stabilize tho.

I didn't buy alot, but I started at $900. Currently I'm at an average of $1200. Still, I don't have a lot so there's not a huge return yet. I'm going by the "invest what I can afford to loose" motto.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:07:23
But, why? Wouldn't that simply void their blocks when it finally locks in? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:22:58
And a congrats to those of us that saw it as a buying opportunity? ;) 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:22:18
I'm struggling to understand why the few that remain, won't just join the party... I mean, they must know resistance is futile? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:08:33
Yea perhaps, but still... Delaying the inevitable just can't be good business practice in any case. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:52:35
Haha yea I suppose so. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:49:55
No fixed amount. But half of what I'd otherwise put in a savings account. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:13:21
I started buying at $900. Not a lot unfortunately, just enough to keep myself interested. Since then I've taken part of each salary and converted it to Bitcoin. And boy am I happy I did. I think I'm in this for the long haul. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:24:31
Wait, what? How do they fake signal?.. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:39:42
Wages are not income?.. 
And you get to decide what your taxes are used for, every 4 years in the US. Don't like that system? Vote to change it. Can't? Well, then all you have left to do is migrate to a country that don't spend money on wars and killing. 
If you think BTC will change anything with regards to this, you are mistaken. If you think I'm wrong, please do explain how it ever could.

Wait what? Double Life in prison? For having a market place?
Man, I have not been keeping myself updated well enough.

The very *definition* of HODL.

"a bit"... Understatement of the year. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:29:07
Not saying it is, but I still found it funny.
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:49:01
As soon as it falls, I buy. And then I hold. Haven't sold any since I started, apart from a small amount when I was strapped for cash. I think BTC will be worth 10x what is now, in a not so distant future. 
However, I'm not knowledgeable really, I'm just going with gut and an overall interest in this space.

@_date: 2017-06-17 11:56:05
Well yea ok, but how come it goes down so MUCH? I mean, when a stock is dumped by lots of people, the fluctuations aren't THIS massive... 
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:15:11
I agree that he should go to jail. Unpopular opinion around these parts, I'm sure. However to me it comes to motive: Why create that type of market place? It was hardly to sell books and tshirts. And if the motive is to facilitate illegal activity, that is a crime whether we like it or not. 
But like you said, the punishment is way excessive. Especially since weed is becoming more and more legal everywhere in the world and the majority of drug sales on Silk Road was weed. Or, so I've been led to believe... I never actually used Silk Road. I wasn't into btc then either. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:47:40
I have yet to find a single store that take BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:15:39
I have. Ages ago. I guess I want paying close enough attention. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:36:38
Please cite your sources on all of that, because none of it makes sense. 
You are NOT paying 50% in taxes.

IRL store. In Sweden.

BTC is not a stock, so that's an immensely difficult question to answer.

Shitty childhood?

Is there an explanation to all the things currently happening, aimed at non tech-savvy people? 
Asking for a friend... :D
