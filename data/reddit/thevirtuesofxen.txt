Looks promising. Any chance of it becoming open source?

I've talked with people in IRC who say their Crossfire rigs have small performance hits while linked and mining. I haven't tried mining with Crossfire enabled, so I can't verify that claim. However, you can enable/disable Crossfire within CCC without having to take off the bridge/link thing from the video cards.

I have a Google Apps account for my domain. My email address was on that list. I was able to sign in to my Google account with that email address and password on that list without any verification.

I was thinking the same thing. Here's a thought though: Wouldn't the increase in difficulty force a lot of miners out, decreasing the network output, thus decreasing the difficulty in the long-run?

Oh, so that's why I suddenly got replies to that post from 2 weeks ago.

I've tried it. It's pretty fast and convenient. After the Mt. Gox fiasco though, I lost my trust in eWallets and sought my own secure solution instead.

I thought of that. Those things were $26, about $10 more than a good USB key. In addition to mining, these things also host my music collection :3

Isn't the faucet for people who are getting started with bitcoins?

Admittedly, the first few transactions are slow as hell. After using Dwolla for a month now, Mt. Gox transactions take a matter of hours. My credit union is slow, and it takes about a day for the money to come in. Here's proof (sorry for the poor screenshots, I only had my phone on me at the time).

Do we really have to bring this crap into Bitcoin now? Luke-Jr may have different views from us, but he doesn't advertise it on his pool or site. I mean shit, I don't necessarily agree with the guy but I'm not going to go out of my way to lash out at him for it.

I can't figure out why people buy SSD's and cases for these things. It adds about $140 in extra costs.
[Here's a pic of my setup]( I mean, it isn't harmful to not have a case, is it?

I am aware of the fiasco that tortoise pointed out with TradeHill, but I have been using Dwolla without a hitch since May 2011. In total, about $1200 of money that I have made through BTC has gone through Dwolla and into my bank account. IMHO, I would not be concerned with keeping your account credentials in Dwolla. I would however keep an eye on them in case they change their minds about Bitcoins.
