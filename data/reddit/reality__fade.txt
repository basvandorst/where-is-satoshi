Been here since 2013, genius.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:05:14
My point in mentioning how long I've been involved should be obvious.
I've seen so many Bitcointalk TA threads that have been 110% wrong, they're just worthless...
I only believe masterluc's predictions at this point and, with his most recent, I think he will be wrong.
  
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:57:19
For me it is, yes.  I'm sure mommy told you different.
In the last 5 months everyone who has just learned about bitcoin is an expert.
Protip:  you are not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:06:01
It's a tossup for me as far as who I'd rather have removed from society.  They are both human shit and both "projects" have significant global impact.

"We are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.
Once supported, customers will be able to withdraw bitcoin cash. We’ll make a determination at a later date about adding trading support."

I'm quite aware of what exponential growth means.  Additionally, I've watched most of Ray Kurzweil's discussions on the subject with regards to historical advances of technology.  I do not see McAfee's prediction as being realistic.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:04:12
You are not a bright person.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:28:30
Do you even know what that means?
If you choose to mock what I say, please tell me what it means to you.
Tell me who they are.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:06:17
Jesus fucking christ this sub is like YouTube on steroids.
You are not unique snowflakes.  You are not going to be gazzilionaires by buying $100 worth of bitcoin.
Many have sacrificed years of their lives and/or wagered large sums of capital to bring things this far.
YOU are not a bitcoin expert unless you can explain the bitcoin code.
It's here for your review:
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:49:19
You haven't a semblance a clue what you are talking about.
Yet another "genius" who recently landed here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:45:31
You are not a bright person.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:24:07
"For the 20th time."
Um, no.  It's not my problem you are wasted and on Reddit.

Make sure to click the play button on the chart.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:12:52
It IS on the front page.  =P
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:23:27
I hope that fucker is impeached.  Piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:55:25
This is masterluc, genius.
Google him.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:32:23
You know what? For every comment that is posted, there are many different comments for a wannabe debate team armchair warrior to make.
It is impossible to refute everything.  It's called Gish Gallop.
Look it up you stupid fuck.
Peace.  I'm out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:56:41
OK, genius.  How long have you been involved with BTC?
Also, your reading comprehension is terrible.  I did not say PayPal is like bitcoin.  
Jesus tap dancing Christ.  I want my own island where I never need to deal with people whose parents all told them they are super ultra special.
Go back to YouTube comments, dude.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:44:03
Says the guy with less than 2.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:56:21
I understand.  The key word in my post is "average."
I do not see his prediction happening because the UX largely still sucks.  ...unless financial entities pump it that high.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:41:48
There is a significant difference between releasing bcash balances and making available for purchase and trade on Coinbase/GDAX.
Coinbase seems to be quietly assisting the powers that be in pushing things to a centralized model under the guise that bcash is better.  Anyone who has some semblance of a clue how bitcoin/Bitcoin works and follows the drama knows this.
Perhaps my interpretation is wrong and, if so, I'd appreciate if someone not from who has an account older than 3 months can tell me why my opinion is incorrect.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:08:57
No, you are an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:12:16
I never suggested banning everyone, genius.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:23:32
This was also the 1st I ever saw.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:29:21
Hi, hipster, bruh.  I've been here since, bruh.  You, bruh?
Fucking tool.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:52:47
It IS that easy.  Each bot is tied to an account on a given exchange.  
Give me a fucking break.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:43:33
Don't panic.  Don't sell.  Hodl.

All of the exchanges know who is responsible.  You need to basically give a DNA sample to use one.
Nobody is pushing them to give up who is repeatedly doing this.  Why is that?
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:21:45
They have no idea what the fuck they are doing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:43
It's called manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:07:50
If thing fails I'll just lose my investment.  If there was any doubt that BTC is manipulated on exchanges, that should no longer be the case.
Given that you need to give a DNA sample to use an exchange, they know who is doing it.
I want to know who is behind it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:15:15
I also wouldn't let someone operate on me before I checked their credentials.
Here, any piece of shit with a computer is now a genius.
It's hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:50:57
If "authorities" demand KYC/AML, people cannot claim it's a free market.
I demand to know which assholes have been behind this for years.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:01:33
Child alert.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:36:17
Dude, I've been here for nearly 5 years under numerous accounts.
You are a noob.  So stop being a dick.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:27:13
Nope, stating a fact.  You are helping to reinforce what I said.
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:59:13
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:50:09
I've been here since 2013 despite the age of this account.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:07:50
Dude.  Things are simultaneously coordinated across exchanges globally largely using bots and FUD tactics via the media.
I assume you also thought the Govt. wasn't doing shady shit until Snowden broke the story.
At best you are naïve.  At worst you are part of it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:57:53
You may want to reconsider that strategy:
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:10
As of the time of this post, there are 3 "geniuses" who have posted.
My offers stands.  This subreddit had turned into a a place filled with get rich people, trolls and idiots.
I will pay 5 BTC to anyone who brings charges against Roger Ver and successfully litigates.  I will give 15 BTC if someone brings charges against both Ver and Coinbase and successfully litigates.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:36:45
Unless the UX improves significantly, yes.
Many many people are going to get burned keeping bitcoins on their computers.
TPM support on phones, IMHO, will be necessary before this takes off.  Do you think Apple, for example, is going to support that?  Fuck no.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:58:31
Those of you who act like assholes, I wish you the best. Eventually you will grow up and learn that pretty much nobody gives a shit about you. You are not unique and are fighting for the same comfortable lifestyle most everyone on this planet dreams of.
Being an asshole online or in real life will not help you in most cases. It'll take you 10 years to understand that when you are in debt with kids and getting divorced-none of which apply to me.
Good luck, you geniuses.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:23:30
You're a fucking tool.
Nobody has taken anything from me.  This manipulation is fucking ridiculous.
Bitcoin is never going to work.  
My only wish is that Roger Ver loses everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:17:24
You have the world at your fingertips.  I'm only pointing out the obvious.  I'm not your teacher.

Don't care.
