TAILS is really better suited for running Electrum, since you don't need to store the blockchain or any wallet.dat. Just boot into Tails, start Electrum, and regenerate from seed. When you're done making your transactions (or signing offline transactions for broadcast) you can shut down without ever having had your private keys written to persistent storage. Combined with a watch-only wallet on your online computer, this is far easier and more secure.

This has been on my mind as well. In a related vein, I've been looking for ways to invest BTC, and yet I find that when I have to judge any potential investment against the ongoing value increase in BTC itself, there are no places to reasonably invest. How can you invest a deflationary currency? Huge swaths of investments I might make in USD just aren't rational with BTC.

Truly. 10% is one thing, but really we're talking +7000% just by sitting in BTC the past 12 months. I certainly don't expect this situation to last forever but nonetheless no rational actor will re-invest BTC in non-BTC based businesses for a long time to come.

I don't pretend to grok elliptic curves but what he is stating is:
Some subset of public keys are weak (that is, private key can be cracked easier than by brute force) relative to their proximity to a set of "rendezvous points" along the elliptic curve. He has stated knowledge of 768 rendezvous points. He has not described the distance from the point that makes a public key/address crackable. He has not described what portion of the entire address space is (practically) vulnerable. He is trying to crowd source the finding of new rendezvous points by paying for people to run the code to find them for him (not cool). And he's selling the actual code to do all this (also not cool).
It doesn't matter what PRNG you use, some subset of addresses are weak.
[This post summarizes well.](
It's an important finding, but it's danger is not immediately known. Presumably the weak ones are a very very small subset of a very very large set of addresses.

Out of the top 7-10 crypto exchanges Bitstamp has, in my experience, the most consistently unreliable and buggy API (only surpassed by Cryptsy, which is absolutely horrendous). From a developers perspective, I shudder to think about their actual backend systems. I have nightmares of MtGox all over again...
On a side note Btc-e, as much as everyone loves to hate them, I'd rank number one. Kraken is also quite good as is ItBit and Coinsetter with well funded dev teams, though none of them have the track record of Btc-e.

The safest solution is to print out paper wallets in increments of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 USD. This makes it very convenient to spend your coins. Also you don't have all your money stored on one paper in case of fire, theft or loss.

I have a hard time believing you run any e-commerce business. I've shipped products internationally for years via USPS and it requires nothing more than the appropriate customs forms. Buyer is responsible for import taxes, duty fees, and whatever local regulations may prevent him from receiving the product. If he decided he didn't want to pay the import tax, the parcel gets returned to sender and I can refund him (although it's taken as long as 3 months the handful of times that occurred).
There's no magic involved. You can auto generate the forms in the stamps.com application if you don't have a more sophisticated setup.

Deterministic wallet: all addresses are generated from one "seed" number. You can essentially use the seed as a backup, and regenerate all the same addresses later.
This seed can be split up into public and private halves. The "extended public key" will only generate the public keys of those addresses. You need the "extended private key" to generate all the private keys.
Hierarchical deterministic addresses: they use a seed, m, and generate the addresses in a tree-like structure. m/0, m/1, m/2...
but also m/0/1, m/0/2, etc
The values used on each node of the tree can be anything. You can generate m/2014/3/19 to be a key used only for today and then regenerate it from seed later on.

Many people that do pay taxes (whether from a sense of civil obligation, fear of consequences, fondness for paved roads, whatever) get more than a little irked by super wealthy people or companies that can by extraordinary efforts avoid paying their share. A small business owner has to pay, but Apple can offshore all their revenue and pay nothing? Hence public opprobrium.
Bitcoin riche American renounces his citizenship and moves to the Caribbean to avoid taxes on $100M in unearned income? I don't remember that checkbox on my 1020EZ...
So no, it's a pretty normal sentiment to have no sympathy for this whining douche canoe who RENOUNCES HIS FUCKING CITIZENSHIP and then cries on Twitter about the entirely predictable consequences. The lolz are killing me...

Actually he is a federal agent, and the criteria to become such is not as low a bar as you imagine. Regardless of that, this isn't just his pet "theory". His testimony was about the statements he made in an affidavit in support of a search warrant. You need probable cause, and this is an outline of the evidence he attested to to a judge.

Not as such, but if they were run as one criminal enterprise and co-mingled funds it's possible that the hit impacted gox. Gox was running fractional due to willybot manipulation. Perhaps he was only leveraging goxbux to the extent that he was holding an SR bankroll.

You seem to be a serious developer with some cool work, so I don't mean to be overly critical but I'll list a few points why I don't think this could work.
I own and operate two "brick and mortar" retail stores. POS systems handle a good deal more than just payment processing. Unless you build a full-featured POS system incorporating also cash handling, credit card transactions, inventory management, sales analytics and all the other features a merchant needs, then this can't compete as a sole replacement.
Integrating with an existing POS package is more doable. But most of the big POS vendors (in the US at least, I can't speak for EU) do not provide API access or any kind of open extensibility (there are some limited exceptions, Revel comes to mind, but in general the systems are pretty closed access). It may be difficult to integrate your device as an open-source developer without contractual agreements with the vendor. And then why do this in hardware at all?
And a non-integrated stand-alone bitcoin terminal in addition to a standard POS system is a no-go. POS is tightly integrated into accounting and inventory management software. I'd have to manually enter the bitcoin transactions, deduct inventory and whatever else to get these transactions included.
Another thing, which wasn't appreciated by, for instance, the tinkerers who made the bitcoin ATMs that fail so spectacularly is that the service model is a hugely important piece. If the POS system has an issue, the business needs that 24 hour service department to help an unskilled store manager get back to ringing people up. I can't do tech support on a Raspberry Pi (as awesome as I think they are) in the middle of the day in order to complete a customer's sale.
Another issue, maybe unpopular to mention here is that in the day to day retail world nobody really wants to pay with bitcoin. Believe me I try. I accept bitcoin in my current POS system and it doesn't get a whole lot of use, despite a discount, stickers, signs and press releases. I'm sure this varies place-to-place and industry-to-industry but the total uptake is just too low at this time to justify spending anything on POS bitcoin unless, like those ATM owners, you're doing it for ideological reasons instead of actually running the numbers and doing it for business reasons.
The larger issue I see is the difficulty in buying bitcoins for the average person. Unfortunately, the impediments are more political and regulatory and not technical. Until the utility and value gained by using bitcoin exceeds the effort required to obtain them, their retail use is not going to edge out credit cards or cash.

The POS system is NCR Silver. It's one of the few big vendors that offers bitcoin integration (via BitPay), so bitcoin is a payment option at the time of sale just like credit card or cash. The sales are pushed to the accounting software automatically so it's no more work than cash or cc.
Really that's the only way I could do it. There are so many accounting (and other) tasks that can't be automated that I have to weigh anything that adds to the continual workload against what revenue potential it might provide. I love bitcoin, but it's not (for the most part) ignorance that is keeping it from instantly being accepted at every business everywhere.

Greater than $10k cash in one transaction requires a CTR (Currency Transaction Report) which is filed with the Treasury Dept. If you try and break this out into a few sub-$10k transactions you can expect a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report). CTR you will sign. SAR it's actually a felony for the bank to disclose the filing to you.

Yes. If you always accessed your ledger wallet over a VPN you would at least obscure your IP address from the ledger api servers (although the VPN might have IP logs as well).
But if you have ever in the past connected that wallet without the VPN, then the information has already leaked to them.
Tor offers better anonymity. But again, if you've ever connected to that wallet over the clearnet then the information has already leaked.

Similar to Electrum, a Mycellium client connects to a Mycellium server to download transaction history and balance and broadcast signed transactions. The company has access to the client's IP address, wallet, transaction history, etc.

[ledger-wallet]( appears to function in the same way.
The alternatives are to use one of these thin-wallets over Tor or a VPN, or run your own full node.

In theory sure a BTC bank could give out BTC loans and pay interest to depositors from that income. But there is nothing on the site to indicate any sort of investment of these deposits. And lending BTC is a risky bet when the currency itself increases in value so rapidly.

The Cryptsy API does not support rights restrictions at this time. Any API key can execute trades (not withdrawals, though).

First of all I actually *am* implying bitcoinsand is a ponzi -- i.e., they're paying "interest" from investor deposits. That was the point of the OP when I compared it to [BS&amp;T](
But anyway I'm not accusing skypiea of being a ponzi. It strikes me more as vaporware/unimplemented idea. The value of that idea is debatable, but the ad copy is a bunch off buzz-word grandstanding and you can still be described as shilling when you pretend you're a mere satisfied user while you're actually the owner/partner of the site.
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:22:25

Your skypiea (pie-in-the-sky?) site annoys me now. It's fake. I said YOUR site. Being that you are the owner.

Not addressing my point. Bitcoinstore is not a business. It's a bitcoin buying strategy for "bitcoin Jesus" Roger Ver that has the unfortunate side effect of destroying the bitcoin consumer electronics space.
If Walmart sold every item at 0% markup and drove out every other retailer in the country out of business they would be sued by the Justice Dept under anti-trust laws. It's a perfect example of [predatory pricing]( and all the consequences that come with that.
Your argument that a business model based on bitcoin forever increasing in value is nice in hindsight but it's nonsense as a real business model. As with buying late-delivery mining equipment, you'd be better off spending all those sunk inventory costs on simply buying BTC at today's price, if that were really the business model...
