Yes, there are many places that accept bitcoin as payment. 
Just search 'Where can I pay with bitcoin?' or something similar and you'll find loads of major players that do.

I'm new to the whole bitcoin thing and I have some questions regarding wallets. 
I downloaded Electrum and used it to create a wallet. This gave me a seed and a wallet file. Does this mean I now have a Bitcoin 'account' with the seed being the way to access it? If I ever wanted to switch to a different wallet program or if my PC catches fire, is all I have to do input the seed into a different program and I'd get the wallet file back, and thus my bitcoins? 
I also made an account on Coinbase which appears to have its own Wallet feature. Can I use my Electrum wallet on Coinbase, or do I have to send everything to my Electrum wallet every time I buy something on there and just use it as a temporary storage?
Thanks in advance.

I just spend €100 on BTC.
First I hated myself for not buying any when it was about 80 each, and thought it was too late now. Then the same thing happened with it was in the hundreds. Then it got to the thousands. Every time I thought I missed the boat, I'm not letting that happen again.
Maybe it's actually too late now and it's going to crash tomorrow, but oh well, I'd lose some money. If it keeps going up however I'll be glad I finally did it.

Don't spend money you're not prepared to lose.
When you buy bitcoin you have to think that the money you just spend is gone, and you might get something in return for it in the future.

Risk is relative. If $7100 is nothing to you then go ahead. 
If it is a lot to you, like it would be for most people, then don't. Start with a smaller amount you're prepared to lose.
