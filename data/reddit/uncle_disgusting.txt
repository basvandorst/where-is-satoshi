The banking industry and fiat money are probably not going anywhere fast.
I suggest the better course is to deal with reality as it actually is, rather than how you would like it to be.

Despite the USG's best efforts, the US Dollar Index is well off its 2008 lows:
It is however very much an ugly sisters contest out there in fiat-land.

Yeah, Mt Gox was already hacked last year, supposedly just by thieves, but who knows?
Suggest it might be naïve not to expect more of the same in future.
Sooo... keep it offline, encrypt it, back it up!
Me personally, not in BTC but very interested; however would like to see a pullback to get in. Then again, lots of pros were saying the same about the SPX in Spring 2009...

So long as $576 low on 2013-12-07 holds, it's just a retest ;)

So... what you're saying is that everyone should jump on board for the dead cat bounce, right? RIGHT! :D

Well, I don't know about you, but when I am laundering money, I tend to prefer something that doesn't keep a perfect audit trail of every transaction ever made, forever ;)
Sure, you might think you are anonymous, but names are eventually put to addresses when data is stored forever; do you really want to be looking over that shoulder for the rest of time?

Rhaeto-romansch is a romance language that predates German as a spoken language in Switzerland. Today, it is spoken by a small percentage of the population, mostly in the mountainous region of Graubunden in the SE of Switzerland.

Ever heard of climbing the "wall of worry"?
The time to worry about a crash is when we run out of naysayers and even the Daily Kos has jumped onboard...

One obvious answer is that as we go forward, some sort of sharding solution could be developed, such that each node stores just a portion of the entire blockchain.
This in turn raises new problems in terms of verifying the integrity of the blockchain however.

Signed by 33 of 200 members. Just a consultation paper by the looks of it. But yep, the old canard of money laundering again - sigh.

Bang on the money; it would provide a floor, a bid (which is what goes missing in a crash).
Most people have swallowed the bunk about short sellers cause crashes fed to them by dishonest/ignorant politicians.
Think about it - which is the one group of market participants that HAS to buy at some point? Yup, the short sellers. Therefore, as they take profits they provide a bid and a floor under prices. 
They also fuel acceleration to the upside when they get it wrong and short into a climbing market - this is known as a short squeeze.
The only thing that crashes a market is when every last buyer has bought.
