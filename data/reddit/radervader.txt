So, you consider your reply to be a proper answer to the question? Maybe you should go back to school before going home.
If you want people to believe you, you have to convince them WITH ARGUMENTS. What were your arguments? None! Therefore no reason to believe you.

I am not assuming anything. I am just asking questions in forums to understand the topic better. I am no IT/Computer science expert, therefore I don't have the knowledge to discuss such a topic in depth. It is only what I read.

The question is in the title of the post. Idiot.

Doesn't sound very convincing

What are you talking about? I just asked a question in a forum. That is what these are for. To discuss topics. 
And you brainless offshoot of an ape should know that if you want people to believe you should convince them first. Stop playing the messiah, as if people should believe you blindly. First comes convincing, then believing.
Again, if you don't like it here, go home.
