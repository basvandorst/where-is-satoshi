Sometimes the time between blocks is 20 minutes.  It seems they should just request more bitcoin if the price volatility was a problem after it confirms.

Yes reporting more people in the pool is another good way.

Who do you think pays for that fraud protection?

Why does Bitpay have a fifteen minute limit?  That is the problem.

I am looking at the long term usability of bitcoins. I do not want to have to check the price of other goods and services to know what I am giving up buy buying a car.  A stable bitcoin value gives you that.  You will still get the increase in value like you are getting now with bitcoinalpha inflation ( or goods deflation). This just defines an amount of bitcoins that are stable.

That is the problem, to a lot of people bitcoin looks suspicious because of the fluctuations.  But even in the long haul, there is a limited supply of bitcoins so the value will constantly rise with rising GDP.

Bitcoin definitly has the momentum. But I am afraid that without long term stability it is not usable as a currency. I will have to look into the other currencies.

Couldn't we add a blockchain message that contains a ledger summary of all non-zero balances?  This ledger summary would be verified by all nodes when received. Lighter bitcoin users could start from a ledger summary that is far back in the blockchain.  Starting from a block far back puts trust in how difficult it would be to fabricate and distribute a false blockchain.

Bitcoins divisibility is equivalent to just multiplying everyone's BTC by an interest rate.  If this rate was based off of the economy growth rate, the price in BTC of goods and services would be more stable.

I plan to buy some soon however the price fluctuations have made me hold off and I to feel comfortable I had to do a lot of research.  The price soaring made me suspicious.

I am not saying a a single government sets this worth, it is set like any other bitcoin improvement. By consensus of the users. And the best you could do to profit from this is sway the value in your favor. Which exists today with enough wealth.

It depends on who you want to give the additional wealth to.  The Bitcoin miners or the Bitcoin holders. But that is not the point.  To make it a useable currency it needs to be stable. 
The more I think about this, the new wealth created by scarcity should go to bit coin holders not the miners.  Only the wealthy will be able to mine when the difficulty gets higher. (You know, occupy Wall Street)
