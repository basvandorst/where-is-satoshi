I don't disagree with you that you are probably right about a lot of people, but you can't just lump everyone interested in BTC into that group.
I, for one, am more interested in seeing what could happen if BTC, or any decentralized currency for that matter, is adopted by a large number of people. Yes I own a small amount of BTC, yes it would be cool if that went up in value (I can say the same thing for my US $ too!!!), but ultimately, I'd much rather see positive effects from widespread adoption of a currency that isn't fully controlled by a central authority whether I directly gain from it or not.
Admittedly, it might not work out if it did happen, and I'd really hate to see people in a bad situation get screwed even worse by switching to something like BTC out of desperation, in the event that it doesn't live up to some people's expectations of it. On the other hand, you can't deny that Greeks might not even be considering something like BTC if the central bank hadn't been doing such a smash up job of fiscal policy to begin with.

Just start small. Put in $5 every now and then, then more when you can. Don't expect BTC to grow forever. There could be unforseen forces that cause it to crash to shit. If it does keep going you'll have gained. Don't put in more than you're comfortable losing if it all goes to hell.

There's no guarantee this will go on forever. I say carry on if you can afford to lose 75% of your savings should things go south. Always best to diversify man!

I was wondering the same thing recently and then the other day I saw where someone had written just 'HODL' in all caps when it occurred to me it might mean Hold On for Dear Life, but I guess it doesn't even go that deep. Just a misspelling...

This, you can get up to 50% return depending how your company does it. Take the match it's the best *guaranteed*  return on investment in aware of.

Yeah, I've been following BTC since 2013, and theres a lot more to why Satoshi created it than just trying to help people buy stuff more easily, but that's basically how they framed it. 
They also had to throw in the tired ass point about how BTC was/is used for black market purchases, as if other currencies are immune from *those* transactions.

True. Every place has a different policy. My job has 100% vesting on the match, and a tiered vesting on the profit sharing, iirc.
