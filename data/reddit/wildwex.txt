Hey Andrew.  I believe Adobe has been working on such tools for a few years now, introduced early 2012/2013, called Adobe Edge.
I reviewed an early release and it simply wasn't ready but looking now, it's improved quite a bit - but I haven't reviewed the latest release (or it's associated tools    in detail.

Excellent model for aritsts in the music industry - will be very empowering for artists whom are desirous of connecting more closely with their fanbase, too!

Great piece! It's a good example of transparency and being up front with one's agenda.  
I'm certain that there are many of us whom can learn from the experience and better prepare ourselves for 'the conversation' as appropriate.  That being said, such moves potentially open up future opportunities with former employers whom might have not otherwise considered leveraging crypto-currencies in their business.

LA Time should consider 'crowd-sourced' editing - incorporate editors and reviewers before releasing articles. :-)   And yes, totally agree with your thought process. Good catch!

Consider a currency with a built in needed value like some sort of escrow or insurance.   Note that there may be a currency designed for services only.  Not all currency has to be designed for both service and products!  Keep an open mind.

As we continue to introduce friends/family to bitcoin, be thoughtful on how you present it.  As it ran upward, quickly, I'm confident that many discussed the increasing rise in price, rather than many of bitcoins other useful intrinsic values, some of which are outlined in Satoshi's paper.

Consider that there may be a time in the future when a merchant may not accept Bitcoin and accept Litecoin instead.  Currently sounds unlikely but give that some thought to other altcoins, maybe those that incorporate some sort of escrow or insurance or other value.  Keep an open mind.

IMO, short term volatility will continue until we reach a much higher market cap.  There is a large amount of currency out there that will convert over the next few years across many countries, each with their own ups and downs.

This might have been 'inspired' by the story shared on the media regarding a student's clever college bitcoin sign.

It's possible, but then you're potentially dealing with a central authority or organization, no different than visa or mc.... Unless the card has CPU intelligence in it and is designed to function in that manner with a screen and simple keypad.... Then it's likely to be designed.
