No but seriously, just because you made money doesn't mean you made the best decision. In fact, you made the worst decision 3 times over and still have attitude.

When the fake stands hit aliexpress, it will be $200 minimum. The machining required is actually pretty expensive. 
I think I got a few aluminum mouse pads for like $17 but thats so easy to make, and requires way less material. 
I think a similar Razer pad wouldve been $60-100 so the 5x markup makes sense.

No, mans doesn't know about how large the BTC volume actually is. 2 billion USD can be sold without harming BTCs price if you gave it a week or two. Obviously a massive dump will tank the price for a few hours.

This reminds me of when I gambled $60 of CSGO skins and IBP threw. 
Although that was never an issue for me, I always knew gambling equates to losing all your money. Or at least that's the mind set you need to go into it with.
Same with investing into bitcoin.

in case he isn't, could you explain why that is not feasible? 
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:05:22
So instead of crashing the price or paying back the BTC amount the people lost, they'll pay back the USD equiv (at the date of hacking) and then just have 200k bitcoin to slowly sell when they need the cash?
I'm not entirely sure how that is better, but I also wasn't in the game that early on. 
Thanks for explaining!

Ah also having the coins stored on exchanges would be stressful if an attack occurs. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:57:19
Well I pay 3.99% purchase from credit card, and then another 10% fee to transfer. 
I don't mind getting screwed early as I'm still learning, but eventually I hope to skip most of the fees. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:00:23
How did you get your Gdax to work? Mine keeps saying error processing account. 
Although my CB worked fine
edit: Am Canadian
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:26:02
Good point never considered this, thanks! 
I guess in this case would a better exploit be BTC/ETH or BTC/NEO arbitrage? If you find a cheaper ETH or NEO exchange you would eliminate most fees until the cash out point?
Sorry my mind is very imaginative during the day when office work is mundane.

Hey, they actually didn't verify me for a few days but I contacted them on reddit (or they messaged me rather). I filled in a google form and within a day they processed me from Tier 1 - 3. 
Although depositing money is taking quite some time (wired on Sept 8, still waiting). 
They are quite friendly so be sure to reach out! 
I wanted to try Gemini but I might do so if Kraken wires keep taking that long. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:12:28
I'm certain if BTC was a few dollars they would just refund the BTC rather than pay out cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:39:37
CB is so well done. As much as I initially found the fees to be higher than normal fiat, I'm still too much of a newbie (also pending Kraken verification) to venture too far into exchanges. 
CB makes it so easy. The app looks great too. Wish the fees were lower. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:59:30
I see.. so it's like when my bank account has my money, it's technically not mine unless I withdraw it? Similar to how the exchange BTC is not mine unless I pay 10% to transfer it to my wallet?
My friend uses Kraken, and upon a brief look it seems much better. Do you have any prior experience with it?
Thanks again for your help!

So I made my first purchase tonight using Coinbase (even though I heard about the freezing issues - $200CAD total, 100 btc/50eth/50ltc). 
Currently they are stored on my "coinbase wallet" account and app. I heard that it's not really a wallet, since there are no 12 word keys. 
I have breadwallet for IOS, but I saw that the fee is like 10%. Is it worth it to move such a little amount? I've got a KeepKey on order, so I'm wondering if you have any advice. 
(also how do I increase the $200 weekly limit to say like $1k-$2k?)
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:01:13

Thank you, I will look into gdax tomorrow! Does the credit limit still apply to that platform as well? And once purchased from there it goes directly to my CB wallet/account? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:55:21
I think he's trying to say the point of the currency is to move away from traditional money, so liquidating would be the wrong idea. Not sure if I interpreted correctly though.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:18:31
Is this available in Canada? I don't see a purchase option

Is there more security such as the 12 word combination feature most wallets have? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:48:58
Excuse me, how do I choose lower fees if I'm using an exchange like Bittrex/Binance to move to a wallet like KeepKey and vice versa? Thanks in advance! 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:19:33
I understand that. But let's say this interview happens, wouldn't you feel more represented yourself if Andreas M. Antonopoulos got to explain the fundamentals behind blockchain and crypto?
I do like your videos, don't get me wrong. But Jamie isn't DataDash. You can't just collab and make a video and share different thoughts. 
Jamie would without a doubt go after you and all of crypto. I think someone more involved in the industry could shed some more light. 
No negative feelings, I hope you understood what I meant.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:52:48
$100-$1000 Bittrex or Binance to buy alts 
Anything more I would use a hard wallet. 
I would store anything less than $500 on Bread or something similar.

Takes forever for even stage 2 verification on Kraken. Still waiting.. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:42:37
The miner fees don't take 7% though. And the deposit fee on Kraken is 0, and $10 for CAD withdraw. 
Doesn't that mean if you're doing it sums of 1 bitcoin (~4600 USD) that amount is nearly negligible?
I'm just curious since Kraken doesn't support OMG so I was browsing around and noticed the coinmarketcap prices varied a lot. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:51:10
how come? Is it the scarring
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:04:58
No worries, that was a good answer :) 
It's what I thought mostly. Don't think Keep Key has a slow rate yet. Unfortunately I pay a couple dollars to move fractions of BTC, but at least it only takes 10-20 mins :P
Thanks for answering!
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:06:29
I see. Thank you! Hopefully my Kraken verifies soon.

1.07^40 (number of sells a day from the cheap exchange to the expensive one) 
7% being the margin (probably lower due to fees and stuff) 
40 seemed reasonable if you can get 5 flips an hour for 8 hours, but then again I have no clue lol
