I don’t know. I expect the answer to that question may be the very reason I am here trying to learn from folks that are much wiser than I. So, what is your answer to your own question? Maybe it will help me identify a parallel argument I can understand.

Understood. But couldn’t the bank or other company simply get the necessary mining equipment to handle the transactions for their forked 100 million VPs (that were generated from the one single bitcoin)?

Understood. Thank you for your thorough reply. Said another way, 1 bitcoin can be divided into 100 million units of value. Correct? Bitcoin calls them Satoshis. A bank could perhaps call them VPs (value pieces….or whatever they want). Essentially, with one bitcoin, a bank could create 100 million VPs and assign any value it wants to each of the 100 million VPs. If they chose to assign $10 of value to each VP, that one bitcoin could be used by the bank to move around value of $1 billion, $10 billion, $100 billion, etc. of value (as the value of the VP increased). 
I don’t understand why a bank (or other company) would embrace bitcoin when they could buy one, divide it into 100 million pieces, and use their own mining equipment for transactions. 
Assuming the above, why would a bank ever adopt bitcoin as a whole when they could literally bypass it with dividing one coin?
Why is Visa &amp; Mastercard faster? What does bitcoin need to do to catch up? Who is spearheading this progress, if anyone? 
I understand these things take time. I also understand things get done a lot quicker when hundreds of millions or even billions are being thrown at a project launch. 
Thanks again for your input.

How is the value of a single bitcoin affected (increased, decreased, neutral) if a bank makes their own crypto coin by using a "meta" coin, or a coin built on top of bitcoin? It seems like the miners would generate revenue via transactions, but the price of a single bitcoin wouldn’t be affected. No?

I understand 100 pennies doesn’t make you wealthier than having a dollar. If you forget the value of a penny for a second (one cent), and replace it with just “value”, you then turned 1 whole (a dollar) into 100 pieces of value, that can go up or down depending a number things.

I can appreciate that. I probably have mixed up concepts, which is why I am here asking a few direct questions. 
Do you mind explaining which concepts I have mixed up? Once I understand where I am mixed up, I am fairly certain I will be able pose a more straight forward question. 
As far as the “stupid” part, I am not following your logic. 
If there is a better place for me to ask these questions, please let me know. 
I appreciate your constructive thoughts.

You say miners would reject them. 
Are you saying if the block chain was forked, there is no way for a bank or other company to move around its 100 million VPs (value pieces) i.e. 1 bitcoin by using its own miners and equipment designated solely for those 100 million VPs?
I appreciate your input and patience in explaining this.
