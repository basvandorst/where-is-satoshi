in my opinion the only reason the other cryptocoins are used for is trading back and forth, and with that profit buying bitcoins

if im incorrect someone please correct me: but i think these are preordered buy/sell prices. buyers/sellers set these values, to be sure that if a spike/drop happens, they are in the action for sure

@_date: 2013-04-06 03:42:55
yeah.....sounds like you're develloping some addiction there. 
do yourself a big favor and block anything gambling related, and talk to a professional about this. If you're scared to do that, talk to someone you trust about it. 
That will be the real moneymaker in the long run

i would like to think about that, but when the creditcards came out i wasnt born yet, allthough i can understand the bit about the internet.
or when computers became popular in every household, my dad was like:"we have managed for years without a computer, why would we need one" and when the internet came out he didnt see why we needed internet, but after some time, i had to buy my own computer because he kept hogging it :D
anyway in my opinion the next half year will be crucial for bitcoins, since now the media will report more and more often about it, and they will come more in the public eye. 
the next months in my opinion are really boom or bust.
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:35:16
