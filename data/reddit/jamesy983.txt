I've been thinking about bitcoin a lot, and just genuinely looking to find some counter arguments that I've thought up.  I very well could be missing a perspective or future state that frames bitcoin in a different way than I'm currently thinking.

I obviously can't predict the future, but I've thought long and hard about bitcoin, and in my opinion, people will not adopt at these prices.  Therefore it's going to take an ugly crash for the wealth to be re-distributed.  Someone please feel free to remember this comment in 1 year.  I will eat a sock if I'm wrong and that the price is anywhere near $50k within 365 days.

I think this is a fair take

Thank you, this helps frame it differently.  I guess in my eyes, the big assumption is that it holds as (2), a store of value, through the years and that a different crypto isn't chosen as the preferred asset.

Understood-- thank you for the comments &amp; info, I appreciate it.  Definitely some food for thought.

I'm putting my money where my mouth is by not investing in Bitcoin

What do you think though if Bitcoin price was artificially propped up, and that it's true value is somewhere around $100?  Do you think that's possible?

I'm totally not trying to be a dick, but at most I think of bitcoin as an alternative investment, like gold.  It's a scare resource, reasonable demand, etc.  But how can it be treated like a currency, when it's also valued (at astronomical prices) as an investment?  Also, how can it become a fully functioning currency when governments will do everything in their power to tax/regulate/etc?  The only way I see bitcoin becoming a fully functioning currency is literally by the end of government as we know it.  
Edit:  I guess what I'm getting at, is fundamentally I don't understand how bitcoin can be viewed as a means of investment and returns, yet at the same time, supposed to be a currency which would go against the very nature of an investment.  Is the thinking that you hold until it skyrockets at $100k?  And then at that point, no more volatility, and everyone jumps in?  And then from there you hold all this wealth and everyone else theoritically starts at the bottom?  What is a currency that encourages people to buy, but not actually use?

I guess that's exactly what I'm trying to do, is educate myself by listening to people who believe in it.
