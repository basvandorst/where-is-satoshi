Probably easier selling for cash then converting to bitcoin, end outcome is the same.

I wouldn't be surprised. In Reykjavik at least they have huge hot water tanks (at about 90 degrees C I believe), such as at a place called [Perlan]( This water is heated via very cheap geothermal energy. This supplies hot water to homes in the city.
This means houses have both hot and cold water supplies, the hot being around 70 degrees C by the time it reaches the house. In most countries they only have a cold water supply that is heated by boilers/water heaters in the house. You don't need to do that in Reykjavik, you turn on the tap and have basically an unlimited amount. Houses in Reykjavik are always well heated as a result (in my experience)! So it's not really surprising that bitcoin mining would cost more than that lol.

Working again now, agreed- that was a bit worrying!

Good advice, same goes for any exchange

Enough! But I think the fact they get 0.2% of every trade and money whenever people cash out is probably a bigger incentive to keep going?
