i see, so if i click split it will open up the bitcoin cash app? I just have the original nano, not the nano s if that helps.
thanks for replying : )))
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:49:42
Yeah I need to use it to play poker online. i straight up would not be able to without it.
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:26:20
i just need someone to answer a question or two about the ledger nano 
I referred to the new blog post and was able to update to the new firmware and restore my wallet
So now one thing i'm kind of concerned/confused about :/ so if I go into settings it gives me the option to select the BCC blockchain. if i hypothetically do that is it going to switch my wallet to BCC permanently or can I just switch back and forth as I please? If its the latter, what is the deal with me sending transactions using the same wallet for two different types of bitcoin? I keep reading about how it will create duplicate transactions or something of that nature. Do I need to somehow get my BCC to a seperate wallet to use them seperately from my BTC? Or can I just swap back and forth in the Ledger Wallet Bitcoin app on my pc and make transactions separately on each blockchain without any issue? and one final quick question, when i am at the blockchain select screen it says the bitcoin cash chain requires you have the dedicated app open on your device? is that something different then the ledger wallet bitcoin app or is that all that means?
THANK YOU

Sorry it's basically my whole life savings and i'm freaking out a bit
I'm sorry if i'm wasting your time.

Funny that you replied with that pocket kings reference lol, the only reason I have bitcoin is because I use it to withdraw from online poker. So right now I basically have 6k that i sold for cash in june .Im trying to decide if I  should buy back in or not now

This is a completely asinine way to think about it. It literally had 10b market cap on one of its first day on the earth.. because it was a fork from bitcoin that had a pre-established value. it means nothing in regards to BCH
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:37:16
literally.. dont let her on the yacht
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:30:45
could you deposit on exchange - sell for usd - buy btc back for same amount and then use those now with proof of purchase ?
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:47:09
thank you
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:58:17


this is wrong, in that i mean its 39.6% for short term gains if you make fucking 400k+ a year
also long term capital gains is 20% if you make that same 400k a year

Couldn't find anyone on LBC that would want to buy BCH I should add
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:48:57
difference with coinbase is it's insured. ethereum and btc are insured on there even if they do get hacked

what do these have to do with anything? friendster and myspace were popular into the 2010s and then faded away due to the prevalence of facebook, literally has nothing to do with the internet bubble and neither of those were the "first" social network

Could you please help explain this a bit to me?
 So I have the original Ledger Nano and all the blog says about that is that users that have that can use the "OP_RETURN" Method... what is this? I have had trouble finding any explanation of what that method is or how to do it. I really need some assistance so I can do that before block 530000. Thank you!
