Technically, yes. But a futures contract is an agreement to buy at a certain time. Bitcoins aren’t exchanged immediately when a futures is transacted.

It’s easy to be an armchair quarterback and spend other people’s money. Everyone has their comfort level. Your entitled to your opinion, but it’s just that...one person’s opinion.

You’re bitching about BTC being “owner by Chinese” yet you pump ripple which is pre-mined and 60% held by a corporate entity.

Not at all.

Nothing is stopping them other than lack of education and hesitancy. But that’s not how futures work.

You’re hanging out with the wrong people.

Let me try to clarify:
I have 8 bitcoin. I sell 1 bitcoin to John leaving me with 7. John then sells the 1 bitcoin to Mark. 
At what point does the blockchain associated with my 8 bitcoin become disassociated with the 1 bitcoin I sold. My understanding is the blockchain indicating I sold the 1 would essentially veer off like a fork in the road. The blockchain would always show I sold the 1 but my blockchain wouldn't have record of John selling to Mark?
Or am I completely understanding blockchain wrong?

Okay, that makes sense. Thank you.

Really, it seems like a few weeks ago, it was taking 24-48 hrs at max for me.

Yeah, I placed a buy on 9/22 and they are saying it will be 8 days until the transaction is complete. It seems a few weeks ago, it was only taking 24-48 hours.
