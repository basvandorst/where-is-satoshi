Please check for my update at the bottom of this thread.

I'm just after the answer to my question right now.  I've already analyzed the 2FA, etc., topics you mentioned.

UPDATE:  I was asked to provide more detail.  I sent a 7-page summary to the police (more detail on that, below).  Here is part of what I sent.  
* I deposited xx bitcoins into my account on the HitBTC exchange on February 5, 2018.
* The xx bitcoins were worth at the time, about $xx USD.
* I attempted to withdraw 1 bitcoin from my HitBTC account on July 7, 2018 and deposit it in another exchange. 
* I was not able to withdraw because of a system error, “currency operations are not available”.  I tried six times.  
* I contacted HitBTC support, and exchanged emails with Jane Park over five days, but didn’t get any real help.  I don’t think she read my emails.  I concluded that she was giving me the “run around”.
* I realized at that point that my withdrawals were blocked, and my bitcoins were no longer in my control.   
* I initiated a chat in Twitter with HitBTC Assist on July 11, 2018. 
* They asked me questions to prove my identity (some of them were trick questions, which I could have answered incorrectly if I hadn’t had good notes).  Then they froze my Yahoo email account and my HitBTC account for 72 hours – from July 11 to 14, 2018.  I have a screen recording of the chat in Twitter in which they said they were freezing my accounts, and indeed I checked in real time and it was true.
* During the time that my Yahoo email account and HitBTC account were frozen, from July 11 to 14, 2018, the hacker used my Yahoo email address to gain access to my HitBTC account.  I did not give HitBTC Assist (or anyone) my Yahoo password or any access information.  (The hacker must have had backdoor access to Yahoo – I found this article after I had this problem… 
* Once the hacker had access to my Yahoo email account, he/she could access my HitBTC account by requesting a change of password, which would be verified by sending a link to that same Yahoo email account.
* After that, the hacker accessed my HitBTC account and removed the block that prevented me from withdrawing bitcoins from my account.  This means that the hacker had to have administrative access to accounts in HitBTC and the advanced technical knowledge of how to remove that block.  That is why I believe the theft had to be done by HitBTC’s own support personnel. 
* The hacker left only $11 in the account.  I can provide screenshots to show my account before and after the hack. 
* On July 14, 2018, after the 72-hour freeze, I attempted to access my HitBTC account was still not able to do so.  I requested a change of password and was able to change it.  However, I wasn’t able to access the account because the hacker set up 2FA on it.  (2FA stands for two-factor authentication.  If you have any kind of account on the Internet with 2FA, you have to confirm every login attempt by replying to a text on your cellphone.  This also means that HitBTC may have a record of the hacker’s cell phone number.)
* Also, on July 14, 2018, I attempted to access my Yahoo email account and had several hours of trouble getting back into it. 
* The hacker did unnecessary things in my account – unnecessary for a simple theft.  My HitBTC account was verified, but the hacker set my account status back to unverified.  I think only a HitBTC technical support person could do this. 
* He/she also used the “whitelist” feature to enter the destination address, which is “nice, but not necessary.”
* And finally, he/she applied 2FA to my account.  This caused a delay of several days in accessing my account, because I had to have 2FA removed. 
I've worked in IT departments in large corporations for many years, and trained people on how to use company computer systems.  I think that although the hacker had to have my login and password to make the withdrawal, administrative access was also needed to remove the block on my withdrawals. 
HitBTC support sent me an email saying the following:
“From our side we have saved all data we have on the person who had accessed your HitBTC account. We encourage you to contact the authorities at your place of residence. Upon an official request from them we will be glad to cooperate and provide them with any data we have necessary for the investigation.
“Once composing the request to the authorities, please don't forget to mention:
 - address your funds were sent to (34nZVgQjQCa8K1X4EaHaqkYjBm34d64CJD)
 - the chain of events which had taken place from July 11th to July 14, including the data you have from your Yahoo account history;
 - screenshots or excerpts from our conversation, stating that we have hacker's personal data recorded, which probably will be enough to identify him/her.”
Sounds nice, doesn't it?  However, I didn't think that giving this information to my local police would have any effect, other than to give them a laugh.  So I thought that HitBTC support was just trying to 1) put the blame on me, and 2) send me into a black hole.  But I've been encouraged to report the theft to the local police anyway.
This exchange is located in Hong Kong, and I've filled out a report on the HK police website and been referred to the HK police investigation unit that is physically close to the exchange office.  They say they have taken over my case.  However, they want me to come to HK.  I'd rather communicate over Skype and email.  And if I have to make a statement, make it at my local police station.  Haven't heard back as to whether that will be acceptable.
I think it will be a long siege.

You're the only person on this entire thread that answered my question.  Another person I know says that if I can give him the IP address where the bitcoin went, he can tell me a lot.  Your thoughts on that?
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:20:23
Thank you.  
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:26:13
Okay, I will post the whole story.  Give me a couple of days, I'm going to be offline doing other things.

You're only talking to men?  Why?

Thank you very much!

What does this page tell you?  Is it possible to track down the owner(s)?  I think I need a bounty hunter.  Your thoughts...
