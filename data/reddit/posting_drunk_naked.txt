Just because they constantly try to scam and deceive people, Bitcoin shills call it a scam. Grow up! /s

The answer is usually no.

Makes sense given the volatility. Still a big step.

I'm not an investor, I don't know
I'm an early adopter of blockchain, the most amazing tech the world has seen since the internet.

USAA is such a great bank.  The only one that doesn't actively try to fuck over their customers.
On the phone with USAA support, I casually mentioned how great it was that my purchases showed up in my history almost immediately and they don't destroy you with overdraft fees.  The guy said it was because USAA didn't take money for the Too Big To Fail bailouts in 2009 so they're not trying to pay back all that money.  I never did any followup research but found that an interesting tidbit.

Thanks for the low prices though, I just got paid today :-D

Interesting but honestly how do they know the purpose of a transaction? How do they know demographics? KYC will only paint part of the picture, I've never taken fiat out of crypto.
I'm skeptical but interested...

So that's how they ship all the BTC around? Such incredible technology

Did you really have to ask? Free money is always a scam.

Oh man, swordfish. The "I just wrote a virus off the top of my fucking head and 20 seconds later I hacked da mainframe" scene? Yikes.
Though as a professional programmer I will say it was still a cool movie. I appreciated the way that the Torvalds character was so obviously based on Linus.

r/BTC is a safe space for BCH shills to hate on BTC, and Bitcoin.com deceptively pushes BCH as the original Bitcoin and calls BTC by the name of BTCC.
These are some of the most prominent parts of the BCH community, obviously based on easily verified lies, yet people stay on board? You people think Donald Trump is honest too? Fucking hell.

It's not so hard to install without a package manager, and repos usually don't keep the latest version in the repos anyway unless it's specifically a bleeding edge distro like Fedora or Debian Unstable.

It's called a dust attack.
Google will give you a better explanation than me, but basically its a way to try to identify you.  When that $0.02 is used in another transaction made by you in the future, they'll be able to link the address that you received the $0.02 at and the other addresses that are used to send your transaction.
&lt;insert shilling my anonymous privacy coin here because this sort of attack isn't possible on that platform&gt;

I know that technically speaking BCH has some advantages but it's just so fucking scummy the way they've marketed themselves as The Real Bitcoin, taking over bitcoin.com and r/btc the way they have. 
I'm not surprised at all by the petty drama, they've been quite clear about the type of people they are for a while now.
inb4 butthurt bch bag holders, I don't hold any btc either. Most of my portfolio is focused on smart contracts, nothing personnel kid.
Guess I underestimated the butthurt coming from the btc side.  Don't bother responding or trying to sealion me asking for obvious answers.  You all vastly overestimate how much I care about the btc/bch debate, and if you're too obtuse to see I'm on your side then just go bother someone else.

[Network hash rate for BTC](
[Network hash rate for BCH](
We believe in a decentralized system where people \(miners in this case\) vote with their feet.  When a hard fork happens, the chain with the larger hashrate is considered the successor.  In this case\-\-whining, politics and bullshit aside\-\-the answer is obvious.
I don't believe in or hold either coin FWIW, there are several coins out there that are faster and are better as currency.  I'm just explaining the basics of how decisions are made in a decentralized blockchain since it doesn't seem to be well known.

What game is that? I've never seen an fps let you Bob and weave like that. I don't play many fps though so it's probably obvious what it is
