I got a fine and no jail time for drug charges that totalled 53 years in prison, max. Also got the charges reduced and adjudication withheld so my record is clean and I keep my rights (voting, guns). Just depends on how good of friends your lawyer is with the prosecutor, more so than the charge itself.

You cannot opt out of overdraft fees altogether. What you are thinking of is "overdraft protection" services offered by banks that will take money from a different account or line of credit you have to temporarily cover an owed balance. But some things will still overdraft people that have opt out of that service. The most common are pull request subscription style services like netflix or tips at a restaurant. More friendly banks will decline subscription services if there is not enough in the account to cover the request but I've never seen that done in the case of restaurant tips.

They'd see that 1HLLdeLCkVLRTKVMtPEZGYuRz6xAPgm65L has paid for a porn video/subscription. Not your name, ip, or anything else relating to your real ID. Unless you bought the coins via some account tied to your real ID then some LEA subpoenas the exchange to find out your info.  Similar to a credit card. Minus statements sent to your address for your wife to find. This can all be solved by not using an exchange as your wallet and not posting the bitcoin address you use to pay for porn as a donation address on social media. Ideally you'd use a new address everytime.

This isn't true, you can always overdraft. Example: $20 in bank account, spend $15 at restaurant, tip $5. Buy something at a store for $5 right after you leave the restaurant. Enjoy the overdraft fees a few days later when the tip resolves. This even works with prepaid cards allowing you to go negative when it should not be possible.
