Oh, please. Really, the two of you. 
I find it humorous that you believe your definition of a word is somehow more correct than someone else's definition.
Further, I find it disturbing that you believe you have some meaningful authority over a concept; that is, that "colloquial understandings" have no meaning. By your own (trite) conceptualization of karma, you ought to also hold the belief that it's enough to believe in one's own meanings. This kind of framing alone should motivate you to back off the nonsensical "correction" you just shoved at me, and I'm certain, others.
I am quite sure that my understanding of karma is correct for me, with or without your incredibly presumptuous contextualizing. 
The remainder of your pretentious attempt at correcting me (and/or the poster before me) is so absolutely riddled with empty fallacies and biases that I had to laugh. There is really nothing there except a self-supplied confirmation bias.
Lastly, you would be well served to walk through life with a little more respect for other people's own realities. You really *do not* own a universally truer, larger, or more real understanding. You own only YOUR own.
Wow, did you ever come off as obnoxious.

No it doesn't. You're talking about an imaginary concept.

How do you backup the private key? Is this the same as just backing up the wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:57:49
Ah, thanks. Actually, your last point is really the one I'm curious about. What happens when that kind of loss occurs? What does it mean to BTC overall? Say a massive loss happened -- how would that impact value?
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:59:18
Remorse? I can see your point. I think what you're saying is better than karma, however. It's like saying there's another force, one someone can respond to. That's much more humanizing.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:20:30
Frankly, NO.
What's wrong with you people? I have NEVER returned anything except fully intact or in BETTER condition than I have found or borrowed it in.
I have gone at lengths to return things to people.
You shouldn't keep ANY part of it. There is no gray area.

I'm so glad you said this. I'm SO tired of bitcoin being coupled to libertarians (by libertarians).
Great comment. Could not upvote enough.

Prices drive hashrate and difficulty? For some reason I see it the other way around.

Bitcoin QT. I can see how to do this through the debug window and I'm reading about the switches, but I don't understand why one would do this over simply backing up the wallet.dat itself. Wouldn't wallet.dat contain private keys once a given backupwallet.dat is restored? 
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:08:20
So you would be backing up wallet.dat or the entire folder structure?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:55:40
Same to you, lady.

If miners value bitcoins more because they become rarer to obtain, what would stop the market from raising the value of that increasingly rare resource?

This is 2 factors, but one is uncontrolled. I like the idea of local multifactor better for the exact reasons you cited. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-08-12 19:01:58
Thanks. That's a model that makes sense to me.
@_date: 2013-10-28 03:23:28
I don't think that demonstrates that price comes first at all. I think it  merely shows that they are interrelated in some way. 
I think what's interesting about Bitcoin is that rules itself like fiat money, but it really behaves like a commodity.
@_date: 2013-10-28 03:02:09
But you wouldn't have gotten to today's difficulty without the price going up.

Thank you. What do you currently use?
