I honestly think GDAX is just keeping it artificially high until they open up buys and sells of BCash.

About 2 months ago the same thing happened that is happening now. BCH went from ~$1000 to $2500 back down to $1200 in a span of  2-3 days. Bitcoin took a hit in the same time period dropping from $7500 to $5500 (both rough estimates), but obviously rebounded quite well.

Wow I should probably listen to you!

Yeah I am likely done with coinbase as well. Been trying to get my ID verified for days, guess I see why that hasn't happened yet. Totally bullshit and unprofessional move to claim to start support on Jan 1 and then to conveniently drop it today of all days.

Everyone always comes in and talks about a huge correction where it loses half its value, and it doesnt happen. I believe an actual correction would be to settle in around $9k, although it seems to be on it's way back up again so who really knows...lol
