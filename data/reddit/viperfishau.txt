@_date: 2017-12-05 04:15:20
It used to be that when you purchased bitcoin you would pay GST on the exchange fee AND pay GST on the amount of bitcoin. Meaning you would have to pay $11 for every $10 of bitcoin plus the fee.
Where you are getting confused is that there are no GST implications for you personally for regular purchases with bitcoin. The business selling you the item still charges GST. It's built into the price. They account for it and remit it to the ATO. There are no GST implication for you. If you were in business and it was a business expense you could claim the GST as a deduction.

When the lightbulb came on for me it was when I realised, as a web developer, that I could build a shopping cart that displays a qr code to a purchaser and just scan the blockchain for the payment before confirming the order. It's a far cry from the current ecommerce model where you need a merchant account with your bank, an account with a payment processor, SSL certificates, PCI compliance, there's fraud risks, chargebacks and all the fees, charges, security issues and dev time to set it up and maintain. Bitcoin is what online commerce is supposed to be.
Imagine a future, that is coming, where users will fund wallets in their browsers, phones, cars, etc probably with local currency and transactions will happen behind the scenes in bitcoin. Circle is already doing something like this by using Bitcoin as a "payment rail".
If you're in this for a quick buck I get your point of view. But, please understand bitcoin is a revolutionary (evolutionary?) technology. It was designed for commerce. It wasn't designed just to be something to invest in.

If you have a 24 word seed split it into 3 groups of 8 words. Write group 1 and 2 on a sheet of paper, write group 2 and 3 on another and group 3 and 1 on a third.

I think many people misunderstand the impact the work of the W3C Web Payment Group will have on Bitcoin adoption. The W3C will write the APIs and standards that allow web developers to request payments via digital wallets. The media release from 2015 specifically states "bitcoin and other distributed ledger technologies".
When users realise they can fund a wallet and make purchases rather than exposing their credit card details it'll be a light bulb moment.
Owners of Ecommerce websites will realise they no longer need to pay for merchant facilities, bank fees on every purchase or for developers to code payment gateways.
In the meantime banks and governments are scratching their head trying to figure out what to do with bitcoin, the internet is powering ahead and building the functionality right into browsers for the entire world to adopt.

If you or your firm wanted to buy, say, $100million in crypto over-the-counter, it would be quite easy to drop the price and therefore secure a better rate by dumping enough coins on an exchange before hand. Especially when volume is so low. If the sudden drop in price sparks a panic selloff on the market then even better.

There are many use cases for blockchain, many which haven't even been thought of. No matter what the use case is, there needs to be incentive for miners to mine the transactions and secure the network. So, Yes, you are correct. Without a currency a blockchain won't work.
Many of the private blockchains being developed will be little more than a database.

We don't need a fork for that. We just start pricing things Mbits. 1Mbit = 1000th of a bitcoin. There's been a few threads here over the past few months about it. I think it's a great idea.

It's also a matter of perception. The time is probably right to start talking about the price in mBits. $4.80/mBTC sounds a lot better than $4800/BTC. Of course it's the same thing but I've noticed on many times that it takes newbs a while to process the fact that they can buy a fraction of a bitcoin. To pay $4800 per coin makes people think they are too late to the party.

Well, there's this passage I've got memorized that sort of fits this occasion. Ezekiel 25:17. The path of the HOLDER is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil whales. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill, shepherds the HOLDER through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the finder of lost wallets. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is Satoshi when I lay my vengeance upon thee!

The bitcoin whitepaper seems to deliberately obfuscate whether it was written by an american or not. In some cases americanisms like "realize" are used. And then the word "favour" is used which is the british english spelling.

Blockchains that are closed, permissioned and don't have a currency are best referred to as "distributed ledgers".

I'm not familiar with Dream Market, but if you can export the private key from that wallet. You should be able to import it into a wallet that supports BCH and the coins at the corresponding address should be available to you.

I dont know specifically with coinomi. The point is it's vulnerable to being hacked. Your hardware wallet isnt
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:19:29
Your trezor generates and stores your private keys. They never leave the trezor. The web wallet will show you what addresses you own and balances. When you want to send bitcoin you plug in your trezor which signs the transaction. With coinomi your private keys are stored on your phone. Thats the main difference
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:31:48
Yes. All hardware wallets are because your private keys are offline.

Saw a vid on youtube a a few months ago that showed bitcoin has doubled every 4 months on average since it's inception. If that continues then McAfee's prediction is about right.
@_date: 2016-07-21 00:31:42
Blockchains are inefficient. The inefficiency is what makes them secure. A 51% attack is extremely hard and costly on a large network. Especially, Bitcoin. Commercial entities will try to save costs because that's what commercial entities do. Their hashing difficulty will be low and they'll have a sparse number of nodes.
Commercial chains WILL get compromised by hackers or rivals and their only option will be secure public chains like Bitcoin.

How about we just let investors do their own research and make their own decisions. Some will make millions. Many will get burnt. But, that's the risk isn't it. Calling on the SEC to legislate and impose restrictions... well... isn't that what we are in crypto to get away from?

Use Trezor with passphrase protection. Put a little btc behind one passphrase and the rest behind another. You can have infinite different passphrases

I still don't get the benefit from an actual user perspective with a wallet on my phone. I can't just send coin to some one? I have to open a payment channel and fund it with more than I want to spend and coordinate with the receiver when the channel will be settled? Or is all this complexity going to happen in the background and be controlled by wallet software?

You can hide your bitcoin behind a passphrase and turn off passphrase protection and store some in your unprotected address. It doesn't even look like you are using passphrases. Is really quite clever.

W3C write the standards for web development and have formed a working group to develop standards for the integration of digital wallets into web browsers. 
 Bitcoin is mentioned. 
In the (near?) future wallets will may be built into browsers. People will fund their wallets and make payments directly from their devices. Holding funds in digital wallets will be normal and the regular public will see Bitcoin as a funding option right there beside Visa, Mastercard, etc.
Developments like this could be an opportunity for Bitcoin to edge it's way into the common consciousness until it's use is mainstream. 
There's a long way to go and recently the lead dev showed some frustration at the lack of input from Bitcoin developers
