Brojob ?
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:40:10
yea... no

There is no reality something goes up in value that fast and there is no correction, there was no uncertainty about that.
What wasn't sure was the reentry point.
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:23:27
Nah, you are saying the same thing everybody said last time we got to 3 k.

Why aren't exchanges like binance using lighting ?
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:28:03
where are the other supports ?
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:04:15
 Binance might help you.

No, whatever may happen, bitcoin has way more hands on it now, either its fall or rise will be much faster now.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:45:59
Yes extremely short sided, not just bitcoin but other currencies as well. You are thinking to small.

Triple luck !

You were right, while it went up a bit to 7200(cause of the mass buy out of tokens (following this theory), it is now 6200~
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:49:41
oh look, it is 6228 now :(
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:54:47
ding ding 6200 7 hours later.
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:12:46
Yes, wonderful indeed ! You are on your way to financial ruin. Congratulations !

Binance uses google authentication now as well, I use it instead of 2FA
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:12:49
Yea but we are talking percentage here.
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:19:36
How is that logical long term, why not enter at 3.3, it eventually will go higher.
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:18:07
That only works ina super bear like the one we are at. Try that when bulls are stronger and you het burned fast.
@_date: 2018-12-03 06:13:08
Explain please. I am a noob on lighting network
