Not to sound harsh, but that's why I moved to Ethereum, the community is much more accepting (then and now) and willing to guide me through my questions, with no hostility or poking fun at me. I would have loved the same help from r/Bitcoin. I do understand that as a community that it becomes repetitive to answer the same questions over and over, but that is what comes with the territory in my opinion. BTC would definitely have had my lion's share of investment if I wasn't heckled and ostracized for asking 'stupid' questions. The local meet-ups are at least what have kept me invested in BTC, they really are much more welcoming, granted that you don't ask the help of the online community.
edit: [Prime example of front page newbie question](  
Not one negative comment.
 try asking that question on r/bitcoin without being told that google exists and you're and idiot for not checking there first. how much of r/bitcoin's time is really wasted by answering these questions? It not only educates a newcomer, but it also welcomes them with open arms. Exactly what a community for these new technologies should strive for, especially if you're invested in them.

sound a little salty there. I'll enjoy hodling both my BTC and ETH. funny how Coinbase won't accept buying/selling any other currency for this long only to add ETH. It doesn't hurt to diversify wisely, I'm ecstatic about the news

I don't know about all that. Ethereum and Litecoin have really done well for me, best decision I've ever made was branching off. Ethereum pre-sale has made me far more than Bitcoin ever did. I am still incredibly grateful for Bitcoin helping me achieve that though, couldn't have bought in without it.

Wow, You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

The circle jerk is alive and strong in here!

Wow. This... this is actually really cool.
