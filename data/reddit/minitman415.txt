Sorry.  The lack of clarity is due to my lack of knowledge.
I was trying to ascertain the status of the bitcoin scaling debate.  Is the current plan for the BTCcore to go ahead and release revised code that included segwit? 
Is there a person who follows these developments impartially that I can follow.  Trying to follow the arguments is over my head. I would like to see some clarity on this before investing.

Thanks.  Surprised there are no worthy ventures that go public route. Seems like there would be plenty of demand.

 If I am just using it to buy or sell BTC not store them, which exchanges have most liquidity for large purchases/sales?
Get your point, though.  
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:54:36
Thanks.  These don't include exchanges in China which look much larger.
Why would they be excluded?

Thanks.  Where would a find a list of reputable escrow services?

It just seems like that trading commodities like cotton using blockchain will be utilizing the middlemen at the beginning just to get things started and eventually they will all disappear as the technology proves out and is accepted.

Thanks.  But don't you think in the end  there will be at least one middleman (like a broker) that offers a blockchain app to the buyer and seller of a commodity like cotton.

I am a newbie and phone agnostic, but would like to know if one of these platforms is better than the other for transacting business in digital money? Are new innovative apps more likely to be built for IOS or Android or are they about the same? Thank you for your guidance.
