Wrong.  If you're in for more than $600 a coin, it's a perfect time to lower your cost average. Especially at the time of posting when btc had dipped briefly below $500.

Either way, unless you absolutely have to, don't transfer it while there are so many pending transactions in the mempool.  Wait a week or so and fees will be an order of magnitude cheaper.

Right, it's sat / WU instead of sat / byte.  Since SegWit transactions "weigh" less, they will get confirmed at a lower sat / byte but same WU.

Why would that be funny if he does?  They are an important "on-ramp" for the ecosystem as a whole.  For someone that doesn't day-trade, Coinbase is an adequate way to get more coins (even with moderately higher fees.)

In what way do you see Trezor so much superior to something like the Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:44:57
Some thoughts:
There appears to be three layers of words. 
The background layer is the black background with yellow lettering.
The middle layer is the white lettering.
The top layer is the Bitcoin logo with yellow lettering.
Could have something to do with the sequences of words being input into a seed. If you write out a 24 word seed into three rows, that would give you 8 words per row (possible 8 seed words per layer.)
Maybe the seed words are ones that begin in one layer and cross over to another layer.

Honestly, buy a set amount in a set schedule and you'll likely see better "returns". So, small buys weekly will probably be a better strategy.  
@_date: 2016-03-06 16:55:45
Yeah, remember that 12 word seed you wrote down and stored in a safe place after initially setting up the wallet? Use it and you'll recover everything

I just had three separate transactions clear in the first possible block with a $.62 fee.  Unless this dude did a default .0001 mining fee, it should confirm fine.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:32:24
Not working for me currently either.
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:09:31
Except doesn't that go against the nature of bitcoin? nearly instant, low cost transactions?  If you have to pay these fees and wait for hours to get a confirmation, how is that a better ecosystem than the one that already exists with credit cards?  You'll never get mass adoption if there are fees and wait times associated with each transaction.
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:32:32
You're right.  I was just doing 10 minute updates as I was keeping track of it in the background and not so focused on when exactly blocks were mined.  I understand that blocks are mined irregularly, but they are generally found on ten minute increments.  In addition -- most regular users would be more concerned with how long it takes for their transaction to be confirmed.  Not necessarily the number of blocks it takes for it to be confirmed.  Thanks for the input, though.
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:34:37
Yeah, in an ideal world I would've tried it with 10 sat/byte increments from 5-105 or something to see what was getting mined and what wasn't, but I was just using the Mycelium default options.
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:00:29

It's also a good demonstration that using wallets with "Dynamic Fees"  is important for getting transactions through during extremely high volume Tx times like it is currently.

Actual fees submitted and first confirmation time
High-prio (.000259 | 114 sat/byte) **First confirmation 4 minutes after submitting transaction**
Normal (.0000518 | 23 sat/byte) **First confirmation 27 minutes after submitting transaction**
Economical (.00003885 | 17 sat/byte) **First confirmation 1 hour, 24 minutes after submitting transaction**
Low-priority (.00002072 | 9 sat/byte)
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:37:02
They'll likely meet somewhere in the middle.  I am surprised Coinbase is significantly below the other markets though.  They are usually pretty well aligned with the other major exchanges.
@_date: 2016-06-16 06:25:46
Not a bad idea. I might re-create the experiment and include that information in addition to actual time elapsed. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:16:28

It's only an 18% fee because the transaction was $1. It was also just an experiment with the different levels of fees through mycelium app.  That fee would've been the same if I was sending $10,000.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:40:37
Are you sure you're trying to use the same mobile/desktop wallet?  I'm not even sure Core has a mobile wallet version.

Unless you get free electricity, it's not worth using.
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:57:44
Not sure why my thread testing a variety of fees was deleted, but here is the information provided from that thread:
So, using mycelium I'm doing a bit of an experiment. I am sending a $1 transaction at each of the 4 levels offered in the wallet (high-priority, normal, economical, and low-prio)
On the $1 transactions these fees were $.18, $.04, $.03, and $.01
Actual fees submitted and first confirmation time
High-prio (.000259 | 114 sat/byte) First confirmation 4 minutes after submitting transaction
Normal (.0000518 | 23 sat/byte) First confirmation 27 minutes after submitting transaction
Economical (.00003885 | 17 sat/byte) First confirmation 1 hour, 24 minutes after submitting transacting
Low-priority (.00002072 | 9 sat/byte)
So, looks like High priority through Mycelium works well, and the normal fee calculated was confirmed within 5 blocks.

This is crap.  Bitcoin purchases through a bank account on coinbase take a week because of KYC regulations.  You agreed to buy a specific amount of  coins at a specific cost at a specific time.

You still aren't sending enough fees.

I've used Coinbase a lot and haven't had any problems really with the instant transfers, so I'm not sure why this particular transaction would take that long.  I have been a member there for 3+ years with a completely verified account, though.  Was this a brand new account you were using?  I know they have limits to the amount of funds you can purchase at once for instant delivery -- You have to have several levels of ID confirmation before you work up to large amounts of instant confirms.  I just logged into my account and it looks like my instant buy limit with my bank account is $2,000 but when using a debit/credit card that number is only $250.  So it's likely that is what happened to you.  If I put in an order over my instant buy limit the estimated date available changes to 6/29 (so, 5 or so days from now)
The transaction will clear, just be patient is the best I can suggest.  Hopefully this Brexit mess will have the value pretty near when you purchased initially!  Good luck, bud.
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:58:59
Seriously though, check out the daily chart over two years.  We are honestly right on the "steady growth" path. There will be runups and pull backs, but they are difficult to time, so just simple weekly buys is still the best strategy.  
If you time the drops perfectly, you can definitely increase your holdings.  But we are still up 80% in a year ahs 200% in two.

@_date: 2017-01-07 06:33:31
Look, just doubling the block size does nothing in the long run.  In order to compete with the amount of transactions processed by something like visa, there will have to be second layer solutions (LN).

@_date: 2017-08-18 02:26:03
well, depending on how much btc it is -- consider getting a ledger nano s to keep them in cold storage.  Worth the less than $100 to fully secure your coins.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:39:52
Some folks are coordinating a pump?  Likely testing the waters to see what happens as it reaches "profit parity" with BTC.  Not surprisingly, it dropped 20% from the peak.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:12:39
Gemini doesn't have an app, but their web-based mobile platform is solid.  They've had some down time the past two days but have been rock solid except for that time.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:21:14
Then try selling through coinbase (GDAX) or Gemini for low fees.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:52:41
Going down?  It's  a few % from the all time high.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:55:23
Not without the private key or master seed.  If you want to send me a pm with whatever you do have, I'll see if I can help out at all (unlikely.)  I won't steal your coins if I can recover them.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:06:51
sure, use Gemini.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:15:27
When you initialize the wallet, you should have the option to "restore from seed" or something similar.  That's where you'll in put the master seed.
Is the goal to be able to spend coins from the same wallet on mobile or desktop?  You could consider jaxx in that case if you can't get the seed imported.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:33:52
Well, prepare to pay heavy fees then.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:12:28
yes.  About 40-50% of hashpower left BTC to go to BCH at the extremely low difficulty.  Once the 2016 blocks are burned through, everybody hops back over to BTC. Rinse. Repeat.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:43:48
I'd say the VAST majority of people active on reddit, that know about this subreddit, and actually use BTC for transactions, have enough knowledge of the tech to put a high enough fee so their transactions don't get stuck.  To suggest that all of these low-fee transactions are actual people using BTC as it was intended doesn't seem accurate.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:17:23

There way no reason to expect anything different.  But maybe this will be a lesson to people to get their coins off exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:05:05
lol. Pay an extra 10 cents and your transaction goes through in the first available block.
Also, there's no way your money is "gone" unless you're using some sketchy site that won't return your funds for not meeting the window.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:23:14
GDAX or Gemini.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:14:13
Jesus Christ. Move to another exchange then. Quit posting this garbage every time Gemini goes down. You aren't buying and selling coins every single day. Quit acting like Gemini owes you anything. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:39:28
I made weekly purchases of .1 BTC for about two months -- Got a notification 2 weeks ago they were bumping my limit to $3,000, so just be consistent with smallish buys.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:42:50
what's this now?
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:05:00
I have a solid appreciation for Gemini too, but their verification process isn't much faster than coinbases from what I remember.
Have you considered looking for a bitcoin ATM or using localbitcoins? You'd likely have to pay cash, but if you just need to get coins that might be the easiest option.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:21:38
honestly, if you're just going to spend the coins why bother syncing the entire blockchain?  Just spend from your mobile wallet or download Jaxx/Electrum and send the coins to there to spend.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:36:46
Just withdraw the coins from the exchange to your wallet address. Simple
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:30:46
I already told you how to do that.

If you actually read the article he ends with: 
"Personally I’m buying the dip and happy to have an equity hedge. BTC seems to have 5-10 convexity to my equities, so what is not to love?
It’s hard to sit there and watch positions take a beating but that is what hedges do. The key is the overall result and one thing is for sure, chopping and changing is expensive and very, very hard to get right.
So buy and hold and dollar cost averaging is the way to go with BTC and it looks like there is some cheaper BTC coming our way."
Sounds like good advice to me. Buy the dip and dollar cost average.

In about 16 hours the BCH difficulty will adjust +400%.  It will no longer be profitable for miners to mine, so they will switch back.  This should clear some of the backlog, but it might be a while before things return to normal on the main chain.

A GPU wouldn't be near enough hash power to mine blocks. You'd need an asic server farm. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:29:53
Did you write down a 12 word seed when you made the wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:54:12
I don't know anything about that site.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:15:03
30 sat/byte is a little low right now.  It will probably get picked up in the next few hours.

It'll take a bit of time to eat through that backlog. About 2500 transactions per block (with no new transactions added)

You don't think it solidified the divide in the community even further?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:01:45
Neither one supports Monero currently. I think the nano s is the better choice either way.

Once your transactions get confirmed, it will then be confirmed by every block after it.

It's profitable to mine right now. The end. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:24:35
Then you should be fine as long as your login details are secure.  That backup seed will allow you to recover the wallet.

@_date: 2017-11-12 20:14:56
Well, let's say we take 1,000 out of the mempool per block. That would take 180 blocks, at ten minutes per block = 1800 minutes (30 hours.)  Adjust the math accordingly. 60 hours if we are only removing 500 from the mempool per block. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:06:51
You don't need to use anything near 460 sat/byte.  22,000 transactions confirmed today at 40-50 sat/byte.  So, while $150 isn't ideal, it's significantly less than $1600.

Running a node is not the same thing as mining transactions. 
I guess there could be "Good will" miners that would accept low-fee transactions, but that would be acting against their own economic interests.

If you want to use segwit (you should) setup the segwit wallet.  Send directly to that wallet from coinbase and you'll be fine.
Either way, make sure you've written down your seed and stored it somewhere safe (off site)

Wallet providers will provide a means of "splitting"the coins.  Hardware wallets will likely have it ready within a few days of the fork. So yes, you'll have the equal amount of both coins on each chain

I look at the status of the mempool here bitcoinfees.21.co
It's the best I've found for picking my own fee.  Ignore the recommended free and just use your own judgment by looking at the chart. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:28:05
If they only accept bitcoin cash, use shapeshift to convert your coins.  You can hold them in a wallet like Coinomi until ready to spend them. 
Personally, I wouldn't recommend mining as you're unlikely to turn a profit without free electricity.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:11:45
We've seen this a few times before with BCH hashrate.  When the retarget hits, BTC will be about 2X more profitable to mine.  Miners will switch over, blocks will slow way down on the BCH chain and much of the mempool will clear.
As far as the price of BCH goes, that's unknown.  Much of this pump is only occurring on exchanges -- the Bitcoin Cash blocks are relatively empty.  Personally, I think BCH will drop by 30-50% within the next couple of days, with Bitcoin rising back to $6500 or so, but it's hard to say for sure.  I'm glad I hold equal amounts of both coins.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:24:31
Bitcoin first and foremost. I don't think it's a bad idea to also diversify a bit into eth, ltc, and a privacy oriented coin like Monero. 
However, nearly all roads lead back to bitcoin.  So when the entire market dumps, bitcoin is usually the safest. 
A relatively smart strategy would be to diversify into the top 5 coins or so with the percentage of the whole crypto market cap they have.

@_date: 2018-02-28 23:39:57
Shouldn't take very long, probably.  We've only had two blocks found in the last hour, which is creating a bit of bloat.  You'll confirm within a couple hours.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:24:04
Different exchanges have different limits depending on your level of verification.  Coinbase, for instance, starts with a low limit.  By providing various forms of documentation you can increase your limits (buying/selling.)
If your limit on a particular exchange is $10,000 per week, then yes.  If you only use that exchange you would need to stage your buys over the course of a month or more.
Personally, I wouldn't initially invest all $50,000 at one time anyways.  Dollar cost average over a period of time and you'll hit dips and peaks.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:02:28
Bitcoin growth is non-linear.  We have large bursts of growth with long spells of stagnation.  Bitcoin almost assuredly won't grow $600+ per week for three years.

you can set a custom fee in coinomi.  It may not be the default setting, but it is an option
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:12:51
For one, lower fees. Another: to support the time and talents of the core devs. 
But most importantly, because this is the future of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:54:20
108 sat / byte is a little low for next-block confirmation right now.  It will likely get confirmed in the next 4-5 blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:26:28
That's why they pull their sell order before they are actually sold.  Setting a large sell wall stifles buy orders from rising above that point (usually temporarily) leading to a somewhat suppressed price.  After the buy orders retreat a bit and the price goes down, those sellers become buyers -- scooping up coins for cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:14:25

You put that in quotes like it's what a quote of something I said. I didn't and it isn't. I said I support the core devs.  I did this because i belted it's in my best financial interest.

Well, it seems like they are trying to artificially limit Bitcoin price growth for their personal temporary gain.

I don't really see anyone freaking out, honestly. Nobody cares about a 5% correction.  Call me when we dip below $4,000 again.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:55:56
In hindsight, I think you're right.  I know coinomi supports it, so maybe that will become the hot wallet.

Holding since $3. Redditor for 2 days.  Hmm.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:59:48
The fact that bitcoin can't be seized / controlled by some other custodian.  There are plenty of examples of merchants/users having their PayPal balances frozen for extended periods of time because of PayPal regulations. 
People seem to forget the whole "permissionless" part of bitcoin, which is really one of its greatest assets.

Do you know how to do that if you had different "accounts" within mycelium? I'm able to import the first or primary account, but not any of the others.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:17:25
Um, ok? That's not related to the point I was making.
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:35:15
I mean, 1% is still better than Coinbase and infinitely better than using an ATM.

Buy a set amount each week.
Use gemini over coinbase because they have lower fees.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:40:12
I'm simply saying that lack of custodial risk is a big advantage bitcoin has over something like PayPal.  I haven't made a single assertion about mass adoption, only that the permissionless properties of bitcoin give it an advantage over PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:20:58
Have you tried restoring your wallet from the master seed?
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:57:56
Yeah, I thought about doing this but it just wasn't worth the time to retrieve my seed from storage to save on $2 worth of fees.  
It really sucks, because I used to recommend Mycelium to everyone I introduced BTC to.  Once they did that token sale for a minuscule amount of their company they seem to have lost sight of who/what they were.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:16:37
It's a very real problem that exists. Just because it hasn't impacted you personally doesn't mean it's not a significant thing for others.

@_date: 2017-09-02 01:34:36
No, bitcoins don't get purged from unused addresses.  You sent your coins to someone and they claimed them.

@_date: 2017-05-22 15:49:58
If you plan to buy more than say $1,000 worth, you should invest in a hardware wallet like ledger nano s.  They cost +/- $50 and keep your coins secure.  Just make sure you buy directly from them, not a third party. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:54:07
Looks like the price of bitcoin is going down.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:43:02
Write your seed down and keep it safe. Most important thing to remember.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:16:51
My guess is that they want to expand into altcoin storage, not just btc.  The nano s appeals to holders of most major coins.
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:18:52
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:22:46
Me too, but only under the "fast confirmation" setting.  Set it to normal and fees shrink to +/1 $2 
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:31:00
It's possible/probable they will go the same route Coinbase did and ask users to pay mining fees before too long.  They are definitely losing money by paying fees at the current rates.  That said, the fact that they have low fees and pay mining fees is one of the main reasons I exclusively buy/sell coins through them -- So, it's definitely incentive to use them over other exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:17:47
If you can get approved, gemini is the better option with cheaper fees. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:42:00
Yeah I don't think your $2000 is really comparable to the 80+ million he missed out on.

Very nice, email sent
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:01:14
Don't go through as many steps, especially if you're not actively spending the coins.  Nano s for storage, write seed down on paper and keep it in a safe deposit box at your/a bank.  For the smallest box at my local bank, it's $30 / year. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 04:19:04

Sounds like you sent it with too low of a fee. Raise the tx fee a bit and it should go through fine.  In electrum, make sure you have dynamic fees on.

@_date: 2016-07-11 15:37:12
Both coinbase and circle are fine as ways of acquiring bitcoins.  Just know that you have limited amounts you can purchase immediately until fully verified (ID, address, etc).
I would definitely recommend moving any coins you purchase through either of the sites to a wallet that only you control.  I recommend Mycelium for android and Electrum for PC.  If you have an iphone, breadwallet is one of the most popular options.
Whatever you do MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR SEED.  If you have to restore your phone or reformat your HD you will lose your coins without the backup seed.
If you're into speculating and trying to time the markets, buy at coinbase/circle - move to local wallet - open account on Poloniex or Bitfinex - then transfer your coins from your wallet to those excchanges.
Hope this is somewhat helpful. Feel free to PM me with any questions you may have.

I keep a cold storage wallet for the majority of my coins -- essentially I only add funds to this one.  It holds about 95% of my bitcoins.  I keep a hot wallet for a small amount of coins that I actually spend on a daily/weekly basis.

@_date: 2017-06-05 20:53:36
Gemini.  
The only completely safe method, though, is to control your own private keys. Ledger nano s, trezor, etc.
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:24:43
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:58:32

@_date: 2017-06-06 04:56:17
And the guarantees of that are..?
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:44:14
Inception coins
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:42:29
Right, you'll have to pay some for the transaction itself, so you'll be unable to pay the entire amount in your wallet.  Depending on the inputs/outputs of your wallet, it might cost 2-3 dollars to send those coins out.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:47:23
Gemini. Lower fees and more stability.  They also pay your transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:34:09
You won't make any money.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:42:12
When you buy coins from them using your bank account, it takes 5-7 days to hit your wallet.  I think this is largely due to KYC laws.  
To me their ledger would be considered a sidechain since the transactions aren't actually sent to the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:19:37
I think it's true.  Basically coinbase operates a ledger that they record transactions between users on. That's why it's suggested users keep control of their own private keys (get them out of coinbase)
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:49:09
There's definitely some risk/reward there.  Personally, I keep at least 90% of my holdings in cold storage at all times.  I don't do much trading, though.  
If you're trading with the most common coins only, you could always "trade" with shapeshift. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:53:51

It's not something you have to worry about, necessarily.  But with the way blocks have been congested recently, fees have gotten more expensive.  I'm all about reducing my costs, so taking advantage of very small fee transactions getting confirmed to reduce the cost of future transactions is in your best interest.  
Hopefully this will be something we won't have to worry about much at all in the future.
The point of a wallet, though, is to hold your coins.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:09:14
Check out his junkie post history...
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:55:05
Um, sat/byte is the measure that really determines what transactions make it into the next block.  It's the one thing I want direct control over, so good for blockchain.info
Just because you don't understand what it is doesn't mean it's for devs only.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:59:15
You aren't listening.  Bitcoin hasn't even existed for ten years, so you couldn't possibly have owned any when you were 13 years old. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:29:27
Yeah 50 sat / byte might take some time.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:28:13
Coinbase / gemini
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:21:04
No.  In the case of a hardfork, they'll exist on both chains.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:51:49
If $180 is "everything" maybe btc isn't for you. "Don't invest more than you're willing to lose"
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:54:17
Yep, gemini is pretty awesome.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:57:10
Ledger nano s or trezor.  Take any possibility of user error out of the mix. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:53:00
A transaction from a wallet with tons of inputs will be much larger than a transaction from a wallet with only one input.  The larger the size of the transaction, the more it costs. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:24:48
15% off at Amazon with purse.io was the other I saw. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:36:21
Yeah, just don't store much on the exchange if you're worried about them being solvent.  
Hiring staff costs money and eats into profits.. Coinbase (which is likely much better funded) has even been having tons of issues with the massive volume lately.  I can only imagine things will expand pretty rapidly for a while too.
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:38:50
Totally legit wallet, guys.  They take paybal!
@_date: 2016-05-07 21:14:21
Just buy them through the clearnet at coinbase or circle.  If anonymity is important, pay with cash at a libertyx location
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:38:57
Low effort.
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:37:22

Just a little pullback /profit taking.  Let your weekly buys continue as normal.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:52:12
I think you should definitely diversify into a few other coins.
Specifically, I'd put a bit of my holdings into ETH, XMR, ZEC, and maybe even DASH.  One of the privacy-oriented coins seems likely to me to catch fire (more than what Monero has currently.)  I think anyone holding anything crypto is foolish to not have at least a portion +/- 20% in ETH as well.
If you're concerned about the coins being tainted from tumbling years ago, you can definitely use something like monero to separate yourself from them.  I'd do it in relatively small amounts (5-10 BTC at a time) and hold them in Monero for a few days before converting back to BTC.  You might lose a bit to currency fluctuation, but better that than a target over your head.  
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:06:07
I had a 100 sat/byte transaction confirm in two blocks a few minutes ago, so that seems solid.  You could probably go even cheaper if your wallet lets you choose custom fees.
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:00:07
Well, in the case of a chain split, it's unlikely that both chains would have the same value.  Look at what happened with Eth/etc to see what I mean.  So, no-- it won't double your holdings. You'll have btc + whatever the other chain is called.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:01:07
Well that's a perfectly reasonable response. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:39:33
Except there are plenty of coins with essentially unlimited blocksize that haven't done what you're claiming.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:05:30
A $2-3 transaction is too much to secure $5,000? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:25:39
I think they are just overwhelmed by the recent volume, so closing the trollbox frees up resources for support staff.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:47:49
Has nothing to do with blocksize, mate.  Just normal variance.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:41:22
Yes, but not every transaction has to be included in the next block...  If he selects a fee in the 160-200 sat/byte (still too costly IMO) it will still get confirmed likely within an hour at half the price.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:00:16
Yeah, initiating 4 transactions is a whole lot of labor!
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:05:12
I'm not going to recommend jaxx, I've had lots of issues with incorrectly displayed balances, failed send transactions, and I've especially had issues using the built in shapeshift functionality. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:18:32
Yeah, that's more or less the point of owning one!
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:06:11
Also, just 2 days ago you were bitching about paying a $50 fee to transfer some coins from Jaxx to Electrum because of the number of inputs.  Seems this advice might be good for you.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:04:10
Shapeshift.io. Lets you "shift"between different coins using wallets you own.  An easy way to turn btc -&gt; alts or vice versa.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:17:33
Neither.  Secure your own coins with a trezor or ledger nano s.
