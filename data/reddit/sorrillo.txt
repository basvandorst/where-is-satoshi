It's a matter of risk, cost and possible benefit.
On this case the risk is almost non-existent, also the cost is negligible and the possible benefit for sure nothing except with a very tiny chance of being quite big.

BitGo uses multisig wallets, so one private key is not enough to release the funds. It seems BitFinex is asking the user for the key the user owns in order to combine it with the key BiFinex owns to release the funds to an address controlled by BitFinex.
BitGo should be the one signing their part if BitFinex asks, but given the situation who knows what is happening between them.

Showing "bitcoin minutes" as confirmations doesn't seem like a great idea. The user would ask why "bitcoin" doesn't even know how to count time and would create confusion.
Also if we said that for security you need a 60 minutes confirmation a user could perfectly wait a couple of minutes for the first confirmation and then just wait for a 60 real minutes on their clock, which might be insecure.
I see why blocks is not a good solution and certainty there's a problem there but "time" which is not "real" time seems a bad alternative.

Security can not be analyzed on it's own, it must always be a compromise with cost and usability.
In this case you are trading a little bit of security, not much really, just a tiny bit, to increment a lot the usability and to reduce a little the cost.
Of course is theoretically possible to be a victim of some kind of attack because of using a third party electrum server, but for most cases it's not worth it for an attacker to use those servers as a vector of attack. It's not much gain to get really and it requires a lot of effort.
Also using a lightweight client might be not good for decentralization, but again your part in this is tiny. In fact the miners are those who add most to the decentralization part, and using electrum has nothing to do with mining.

The legal process is closed to new claims.
That said some people are trying to rehabilitate Mt Gox so they can redistribute the coins instead of most of them going to Mt Gox owners, since the current value exceeds the value that had when it went bankrupt.
The judge should decide if it gets rehabilitated or not.
You have a slim chance that if it gets rehabilitated you can claim your coins and they might take your claim into consideration.

Based on how an exchange works your reasoning makes no sense.
There is someone with bitcoins, who is not mt gox.
There is someone with dollars, who is not mt gox.
Both put their assets into the exchange and the one with bitcoins gets dollars and the one with dollars gets bitcoins.
The exchange receives a fee for his service.
It does not require new buyers to pay off anyone. If the buyers and sellers stop at once the funds are returned and the exchange keeps his cut, the fees.
No pyramid scheme anywhere.
The problem here is they probably got robbed of the funds of the clients. That has nothing to do with pyramids at all, it is just a plain robbery.

When you use a bitcoin address this is converted into a script and then added into a transaction.
The address is part of the script.
Using the payment protocol you can specify a script directly, which might contain an address or not.
So the address is not longer an address but part of the script. And if the script does not need an address then there is no address at all. For example a multisignature script without P2SH contains no bitcoin address.
So if in the future the payment protocol becomes an standard for every transaction then the addresses become obsolete.

Using the payment protocol the destination address and merchant information is downloaded into the bitcoin client which checks if the ssl certificate is valid and the information is presented to the final user for review.
Of course this does not prevent other attacks like a compromised bitcoin client, but it helps adding another layer of security.

One feature might be for the owner of the address to be able to post messages which appeared with a mark indicating he is the owner.
The ownership could be verified by signing the message with his bitcoin address.
To extend this you could also allow those who have transacted with this address to post in a similar authenticated way, using their own address to authenticate themselves.
That could allow for two anonymous people who have transacted bitcoins to chat about it and to know they are dealing with the right person.

They will value the client's bitcoins at $135 while at the same time they are selling those same bitcoins for dollars at ~$500 on another exchange to give the clients $135 dollars per bitcoin?
This does not make much sense to me. It would be seen as a scam. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, stop laughing :-) 
And it would affect the market on the other exchanges creating a really awkward situation.

They found 2 addresses with funds that were no part of the puzzle.
The puzzle is using one bit per step, so the first address is 1 bit private key, the second 2 bits, etc.
They expect to find the 51 bits private key in 4 to 44 days: 
And they'll keep working on 52 bits, 53 bits etc.
The worrying part is that during this process they found 2 private keys to addresses with balance outside the puzzle ones.
I don't know how normal is to generate a below 50 bits private key address, and maybe those addresses where experiments or manually crafted by some faulty code, or maybe those are perfectly normal addresses.
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:06:04
There's the hope that those addresses they found were experiments or manually crafted, since the typical bitcoin address consists of 256 bits and those found are below 50 bits.

Let's say you have a machine that every day gives a random number. And you have two choices:

b) Pick one day of the month and during ten months the machine will give you ten numbers. After the ten months average those 10 numbers and you will have a number.
There's no statistical evidence that the number you picked on option a would be worse than the one on option b.
You would have to demonstrate that the bitcoin value between today and next month's value on the same day is not essentially random, that there's something that allow you to predict that you are better off waiting for the number in the next month than picking just today's number.

The spike in price does not happen when a Central Bank changes the price of money but when it announces the price of money will change (or it gets leaked from a credible source).
The change in money supply in bitcoin was announced some years ago, when the algorithm was made public.

The deflation doesn't refer to the currency, it refers to the economy that uses that currency. And demand is an important part of the economy.
A currency that has more units than last year can be deflationary if demand surpasses the new currency created or inflationary if the demand does not cover the demand.

No trouble at all.
If both computers are offline no security concerns also.
But if the second computer is online you are risking a security breach and loosing your bitcoin, theoretically a virus could be already waiting to detect the wallet and spend the money even before you have time to do it yourself.
So the recommendation is to never expose the wallet with the private key to any online computer or one that will be online at any moment while the wallet still has funds, even if the wallet has been deleted since it can still be on the disk. 
Watch-only wallets are the only ones that you should expose to an online computer.

You don't need a man in the middle attack, you just need to do a transaction which is inside the limits of the one swipe transaction. For example a transaction under $5.
Unless you want to "complicate" the wallet adding safe addresses of known previous transactions or something like that, any transaction will be valid if it's inside the marked limit.
When the transmission is done through the air the only limit is the power of the emitter and the sensitivity of the receiver, both can be on the hands of the attacker. When there is no cable don't ever trust the "expected" distance since this can be upgraded without your knowledge.

I'm against the current implementations of voting machines. I believe they do not add really enough value and can be easily manipulated to allow voting fraud.
So let's stick with the paper vs bitcoin comparison.
In the paper implementation all votes are accounted for, no vote can go into a box without all the parties being able to supervise it, no vote can be counted without supervision. The full chain can be followed.
The only way to double-vote is to allow a person, or a group, to vote on different polling places with different identities. And that's quite risky to do since it involves forging identities.
If during the counting of the votes a new box full of votes appears, a new box without supervisors who know where it came from, this box can be detected as a fraud.
With the system you propose this double-vote is much much easier and invisible for the supervisors. It does not require different identities, the votes can enter the "virtual box" anonymously and unseen by anyone, they just need to be sent from the comfort of an office or a house and they will enter the box and accounted as if where real. You just need an official which can create valid votes and can create valid private keys, which is trivial.
As a result you are putting a blind fold into the supervisors, they can see the votes of the people who votes, but they can not see if other votes enter the boxes without their supervision.
It might be an improvement to the voting machines, as those are flawed, but in no way is an improvement to the paper system.

The flaw is not controlling the amount of new coins.
You might decide now that one million coins per year is enough but you have no way to know if ten years from now this amount makes sense at all.
Might be an amount as ridiculous as if no coin at all where mined, or might be an amount as stupidly big that your coins might loose value too fast.
Keeping mining new coins only makes a little sense if there's some control of how many will be mined, and this control needs to be automatic with no direct and no indirect human control.
Right now we don't know how to do that in a way that makes sense for the present and the future.

It's not slow because of the download speed, it's slow because you are validating each block.
Which would be also necessary for the downloaded torrent.


So it is not a good idea to use a torrent download and not check it, not validate it. If you wan't something like that you better use a lightweight client, which is expected to do exactly that with the maximum security expected in this situation.
@_date: 2013-04-27 05:14:49
1BTC = $239
@_date: 2013-05-08 14:01:41
Yes, but it's not a real problem.
There are two main reasons to download the full blockchain instead of a lightweight client:
**Security - Not trusting others**
A lightweight client must trust the peers that provide him the parts of the blockchain needed for it to check balance and create transactions (there are techniques to limit the amount of trust needed at a minimum). If you don't want to trust those other clients then you might want to have the full blockchain. This comes with a price, a storage and bandwidth price. It's up to you to decide at witch point is not worth it.
The fact that you use a lightwave client or a full blockchain client does not change the bitcoin network security, since you will not be approving transactions nor creating blocks.
So it's not a bitcon problem, it's a user problem.
If you want to mine bitcoins you need the full blockchain (maybe I'm wrong on that, let's suppose you need it). This means you need the storage and you need the bandwidth, but you get paid for that. So you will want to upgrade your systems as much as needed, including full CPDs with professional storage devices, as long as it is profitable for you.
The more miners the more security for bitcoin, so the network is paying them to have the means to sustain the network security. At any price.
Also there are some proposals to reduce the blockchain size at some point in the future, maybe those get implemented or maybe not. In either case the storage and network bandwidth are not fatal problems for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-30 11:05:02
You can have a written contract which states how will the wages will be paid, including the source and destination addresses. The contract should state clearly that both parties can decide without the consent of the other to switch back to fiat money at any moment, with just a notification (certified mail or something that court accepts as proof of notification).
In that way both can demonstrate that they have paid and received the money. And that they have done it in bitcoins willingly.
And both should pay the taxes as usual.
The only problem would be to know how would react a court judge about that if there where a problem which needed his sentence.
But both would have the meanings to expose their case and ask for a fair sentence, as all this would be easy to demonstrate with the written contract and an independent expert who understood bitcoin (which is not that complicated anyway).

Some ideas behind bitcoin yes, bitcoin by itself no.
There are some challenges in a voting system quite different from the ones for which bitcoin is designed.
A voting system needs that assure that:
* One person = one vote
* Every voter must be accounted for, if he dies his vote must not be valid for next elections.
* Votes must be anonymous.
* Votes need to be counted and audited.
* Votes can not be stolen or delegated without consent.
* Results can not be tampered.
* People without access to tecnology must be able to vote (voting machines).
Bitcoin covers some of that aspects but not all of them, not even near. A new design maybe could cover it all, but is not an easy task.

There might be a way to use 3 way multisig transactions and still be able to identify who sent what.
It would work with two different 3 way multisig addresses generated using the same three private keys. One address would be for Alice and one for Bob and each one would send their risk fund to their address. Of course if Bob sends bitcoins  to Alice's multisig address it would be like sending free money, so none of them would want to do that.
NashX could instantly create, even before any exchange, the unsigned transaction that would return the funds to Bob and Alice. It would be a single transaction with both multisig addresses as inputs and both Alice and Bob addresses as outputs, so either the full transaction is signed or it's not. Either the funds return to the owners or don't.
Then Bob and Alice could choose to sign the transaction or not sign it and both loose the risk funds. 
NashX could still act as an intermediary as it would have one of the private keys to sign the transaction. Of course NashX could be evil and party with Bob or Alice and send the bitcoins to one of them, but that possibility is already there right now. What NashX could ever do was to keep the bitcoins without Bob or Alice collaboration.
The funds could still be destroyed if NashX and Bob or Alice agrees to that, it could be used to make a point as "don't mess with us" or something like that.
So in essence it would have two improvements:
NashX could not steal the money (right now we need to trust that it won't do it, but the possibility is there).
Even if NashX went down Alice and Bob could steel get their funds back.
I haven't thought much about this, just a "right now there you have it" proposal, maybe it has a fatal flaw, so be wary about it.
About multisig addresses just keep in mind that not every bitcoin client or web wallet allows you to send funds to addresses that start with 3, they still consider those non-bitcoin addresses. It's a tiny change for the developers but still not there. Multibit or Blockchain wallet amongst others, for example, at least last time I checked.
 
**Edit:** In fact it would be good for NashX reputation to destroy the funds if the deal didn't went through, that way no one could accuse NashX to create fake accounts in order to retrieve the funds later in the future for themselves. Since NashX would need Bob or Alice collaboration to destroy the funds and this might not be the case NashX could publicly publish the partially signed transaction for anyone to see and if Bob or Alice decided to burn the funds they would only need to get that public partially signed transaction, sign it themselves and broadcast it.

Usually if you loose money, or anything of value, you should file a claim in the police. So if they find it they can return it to you.
This claim must be truthful, as is a felony doing otherwise.
You can use this claim to demonstrate your loss.
Be aware that if at any time in the future the police or any other branch of government can demonstrate that you lied you could be prosecuted.
This is based on my personal knowledge of my country's legislation, of course you should ask a lawyer before doing something like that if you are unsure about it.

It doesn't help much. The time with the client getting the blockchain is not spent so much on downloading as it is on checking all the transactions.
Getting the file in zip only makes sense if you won't have internet access, which makes no sense, or if you need to configure multiple clients. In which case you can configure one and copy the folder to another computer, deleting the wallet on the destination to force the creation of a new one.

As I understand it both parties have to put risk funds into their account to make the transaction. When the transaction ends both have to inform the site that the transaction ended well, then both receive their funds.
If one of those doesn't say the transaction ended well then both loose more funds than they wanted to transact, so this is not a wise decision.
In fact, is so unwise that even if the transaction is not successful for one party it would be more profitable to say that it was so he could get at least the risk funds. At the expense of the other party to get  his funds also.

First of all, I don't plan to use it, just to understand it.
Your example would be like this: 
1 - We decide to trade 1BTC for $150.
2 - Before we do any transaction I must put 2BTC as a risk fund and you 2BTC as a risk fund (equivalent to $150x2). I used x2 as a simplification, 110% should suffice. And yes, you must first have BTC to trade dollars for BTC.
3 - The transaction occurs.
4a - Both parties say everything went ok. You get your 2BTC back.
4b - One party says it did not went as expected. You loose 2BTC. So you got 1 BTC for "free" and lost 2 BTC doing that (or lost 10%, depending on the risk fund).
That's the idea.


I won't disagree with that.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:58:08
*unless you had enough money in your wallet for both*
I'm not quite sure about that. I think that the change address gets the rest of the wallet funds, so there will never be enough funds on the original address for the second transaction.
But again, I'm not really really sure about that, so I might be wrong.

So **if** the price crashes you won't be able to buy much with your bitcoins.


The flaw is assuming it's a bubble and assuming it's gonna burst at some point in the future.
If it's not a bubble, if it's a useful tool to exchange goods at lower costs than other options, if it's a tool which allows types of transactions that with other methods are not possible, then it has no reason to fail.
Yes, bitcoin can fail and this might mean that a lot of people who have taken a risk investing in it will loose their money. But bitcoin can also not fail.
A pyramid scheme has no other option than to fail, since it promises some returns that if the system keeps running it would requiere infinite amounts of money in order to deliver.
Bitcoin does not do any promises. It might be useful for a lot of people in the future and for that reason gain value, or it might not.

@_date: 2013-05-01 19:48:49


Yes it is.
You are intending to add a technological layer which may make the supervision harder.
If you want to do the voting exactly like paper without the paper, which means going the day of the election to a room full of supervisors and people waiting for you, where you get your voting "wallet" and you "vote" and then you leave ... then maybe, just maybe, bitcoin can offer the same as paper.
Which means it does not help at almost nothing. And that is with a lot of what ifs.
if you give the blank vote to the voter so he can vote from their home when he wants, then you loose the supervision that right now exists with paper.
So making bitcoin like paper seems silly. Improving the election with bitcoin does not seam feasible at all.
The problem is that you are trying to use cash as if those where votes, like if you decided that people voted with dollar bills and try to squeeze so that made sense. And it makes not.
As I said before, a "bitcoin like" design for voting might work. A blockchain designed for cash does not.

Option 2:
Install Electrum and let it create the wallet for you, it will show you 12 words using the same idea that the post describes. More info: 
Option 3:
~~Use blockchain.info and let it create the wallet for you, it will show you 12 words using the same idea that the post describes.~~
If you can memorize the words on option 2 or 3 you have a secure brain wallet.
But since those are random words I would not trust my brain, better to have some kind of backup of those words in a secure place (and I mean it, a secure place where no one can access them)
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:25:32
It's a problem with brainwallets where the user chooses the words.
It's not a problem for brainwallets or any other wallets where the computer uses a random seed (even if this ends up forming a 12 word list or something like that).

The premises are true, the conclusions are not.
Yes, it's based on ECDSA and yes technology at one point might make this unsecure. But no, this will not allow anyone to steal bitcoins since the security can be updated before this happens.
Yes bitcoins are limited to 21 millions and bitcoins can be lost, but no it's not possible for all the bitcoins and their divisible parts to be lost. Only part of those, and what is left is always enough since are infinitely divisible.

It can be done, it has been done, but has major issues. You must blindly trust the person who gives you the physical bitcoins (paper, usb, etc.) because he can have a copy of the private key and spend the money himself.
Even if you check that the money is there when you receive the phyisical bitcoin you can't be sure it will still be there in the future. You have to spend it to one of your wallets, one which no one has ever had access to. So we are back to square one.


You are defining an Exchange. Mt Gox is the one with more users and that had stick around longer. Then you have BTC-e and some others.

I'm not from the US, I'm from Spain. Maybe here is slightly different.
In my country you don't need to trust the officials since they are supervised by people from the different parties. If the official makes something funny any of the parties can see it and can know that he tried something fraudulent. It's not possible that all the parties agree in the fraud because most of them will loose votes because of his actions.
Also we don't have two parties, we have five to ten and all of them can send their supervisors.
Manufacturing ballots does not allow you to do anything, the ones that count are those which get in the box. And is the process of getting the ballot in the box the one which is supervised.
This is the part which with bitcoins gets obfuscated and difficult to supervise by all the parties at once. Putting a ballot into the box because something barely auditable. And that's a major flaw.

The private key is in the wallet. Maybe you wanted to refer to the password if the wallet is encrypted.
If the trojan is active in your computer it can capture the password the moment you sign a transaction.

It's feasible ... at a price.
If the bank automates the process too much it might pose a security risk, if it does not automate the process enough it comes with a price for the client.
Also the client must blindly trust the bank to not steal their funds and as of right now there would be no state backing this kind of banks. With traditional banks there are a lot of controls in place and the justice system knows how to deal with it, with bitcoins maybe not so much. Also the bank and the client might be from different countries.
There also have to be ways for the bank to identify the client or hope the client does not forget his password or loose his whatever identification method were in place.
Traditional banks can offer the service for free or small fees since they can use your money for lending and making investments, doing that with bitcoin would be quite risky and not a good idea. So all the service costs would have to be paid by the clients.
Of course it can be done, it's just a different business model than with traditional banks and so the risks are different.
Also someone could argue that some web wallets are doing something similar to this already.

Yes, you are right that is better to have them on Mt. Gox than to try to protect them poorly yourself and loosing them.
But not by much.
The problem in  keeping the bitcoins in an exchange is that they are not yours, not really. Your bitcoins are just a number in a database in their servers, just like in a bank but without the legal backing and security assurance that comes with the banking service.
If the exchange closes for legal reasons you might never recover your bitcoins. If the exchange has a security breach you might not get the bitcoins back.
Your bitcoins are just a number in a database, while those are in the exchange you don't own them.
It makes sense to keep them in the exchange if you want to trade them on a short term, this is a controlled risk. But in any other case it's not a good decision, you should inform yourself where and how to store your several hundred bitcoins securely.
Hopefully in the near future we will see more security on bitcoin wallets since right now it's complicated to get it right. But right now if you want to own your bitcoins you have no other option than to learn about how to secure them.
@_date: 2013-04-25 11:26:43
I don't see any workaround but one thing that limits the usefulness is the fact that you need to have more bitcoins that the value in bitcoins you want to buy or sell.

If I were the state I would enforce the citizens to use my bitcoins with my permission.
So every bitcoin that touched the state would be only released to the public in the form of double signature needed to spend it. One from the "owner" and one from the state.
It would be illegal to not accept those coins, it could be even illegal to spend the non double signed coins (a free process could allow the double signature by the state).
The state signature would be automatic as long as the destination address were known by the state (an already identified citizen address or business). Otherwise it would require you to identify the recipient and the recipient to acknowledge the ownership of the destination address.
There would be a list of countries which would use this same system and the coin could travel from one state signature to another inside that safe list, countries outside this list could not disable the double signature and would need to act with the same restrictions as simple citizens from the original country.
It would be a slow process at first, with not many coins double signed but using laws and patience most of the coins in circulation would be converted to this system since once one of those enters to the double signature scheme it's not possible to get out.
And of course the taxation would be quite easy. You could not spend a dime until your taxes were paid.
You should be glad I'm not the state.
But don't think for a second that the people there are stupid and will let the taxation go away just because a new currency has emerged.

I think having LTC on Mtgox will help in one aspect, making the BTC value equal among most of the trade exchangers.
Right now there's a $10-$15 difference price on MTGox and BTC-E, for example. It's quite difficult for bots to get profit from that difference because moving USD from one site to another is quite slow and expensive.
With LTC it would be easy to move funds from MTGox to other exchanges  and help harmonize the price among those.

Amazon EC2 seems like a weird choice. On the other hand it would be a lot less efficient than GPUs but a lot easier to scale and control the costs than buying GPUs beforehand.
In any case I don't see any easy way for them to scam people, they ask for a part of the wallet without funds and they give you in return the password. Right now it seems it's free to test it so if it were a scam they will gain nothing at all doing a free trial, just bad reviews.
Yes they could build some reputation and then ask a lot of money in order to give you the supposedly brute-forced password and then not delivering it, but it seems like a very easy scam to detect and with not much gain at stake.
It feels more smart to really offer the service, gain reputation, start making legitimate money and then start upgrading their systems with GPU units.
That's what I would do.
What the heck, If they start scamming people I might take over the idea and start the service myself. Even with EC2 as a starting point.

First of all the transaction fee is not an easy topic, documentation might be confusing and so I might say some things untrue. I'll be pleased to hear any corrections.
The fee is not mandatory, you can create a transaction with no fee at all. No fee means no hurry, so the transaction can be sitting there for hours (even 24/48) without being confirmed.
The default fee is 0.0005 ($0,07 at current price). It's a lot for microtransactions, it's almost nothing for big transactions.
When sending less than 0,01 BTC ($1,21 at current price) the fee is expected for most, if not all, the miners.
Also fees are something that get's changed along the way.

You nailed it there. Except I not only do not agree on the percentages I also don't agree on the timing. In one year your comment will still be valid, and in three of four years we might not yet know the outcome of all this.

I like it when you dismiss everything on the list with a simple "bitcoin covers all of those".
Let me give you just an example, of many many more that can come out if we think about it just a little bit.
~~Let's say I'm the government and I know that most elections get only a 60% of participation. And so I decide to give, without anyone knowing, a 20% more votes and I give them to my voters.~~
How would you detect that fraud?

They also have double authentication using Google Authenticator, you just require an smartphone with Android, Apple IOS or Blackberry.
It's free.
It's not recommended to store money or bitcoins on Mt. Gox unless you need them there to trade. There are more secure methods of storing bitcoins like offline paper wallets, offline computer. And if you need them online and don't trust your computer, which you shouldn't unless you know more than most, then there's also the option of an online wallet like blockchain. Which in my opinion seem to have a fair amount of security measures like double authentication, a second password for transactions, etc.

I trust that both parties will not agree to make a fraud which gets one of them elected. Not both will agree in the other one winning.
In that we can trust.


I said early that I don't trust voting machines and that I would like to keep the discussion in the scope of paper vs bitcoin.
So yes, in voting machine vs bitcoin the bitcoin wins, in voting machine vs a hat and an innocent hand the hat wins, in voting machine vs lottery ticket the lottery ticket wins.


Ouch, that must hurt. In a sane democracy officials are never behind closed doors near the boxes. There's always around supervisors from different parties and even people who just want to be there.
My advice is to first upgrade the US voting system to a one, paper based, which is less prone to fraud. As other countries do. Then you can improve this if it's possible.
Besides, I'm just playing along, I have a hard time believing that US elections are so easy to manipulate as you seem to imply.

When dealing with money the kind of security that matters is the targeted and specialized attacks.
I don't think smartphones are more secure than PCs, they are simply less attractive to attack. And if we start paying with our phones that will change radically, it's then that we will see if those are really secure or not.
My guess is that those are far from that.

The purpose is to be able to be anonymous when you want it, and not when you don't want it.
I don't see any benefit from being anonymous in a payment for a work in which you go personally, and from money for which you have to pay taxes.
There's always have been a black market for wages outside of the system, which are payed in cash and dont' pay taxes. You can do this in cash and you will have all the problems you talked about (no minimum wages, no possibility to demonstrate the payment, etc.).
So yes, you can use bitcoins as cash wage outside the system, with all the advantages and problems, or you can use bitcoins as if they where bank transfers, with all the security that a record gives you.

In Spain it's not legal to offer high risk financial products to people who can't possibly understand them.
The banks offered those products to 80 year old widows with no financial knowledge at all, or people with mental disabilities. They offered those products to people without informing them about the risks which, again, it's not legal in Spain.
This was not a legitimate bank operation, it was a scam. I don't say this as an accusation but as a legal fact.
This has gone to courts and is still going to courts and they have been proven guilty of scamming the clients and condemned to return the money to the victims.

There's no reason to do that, nothing to gain with it.
If you put more money in circulation the rest of the money looses value. You could add more fees and it would have the same effect, more reward to the minners.

For those who don't know what is it about and what it intends to solve this is a simple explanation:
*If I tell my client to pay you, you will receive notification of that transaction from the network.*
*This means that my transaction has flooded the network, and more importantly, flooded to all miners.*
*If I then send a transaction that spends the input back to myself, the network won't relay it and miners will ignore it.*
*So, if you receive the transaction from lots of neighbors, you can be reasonably sure I broadcast it to the network.*
*The proposal allows replacement of transactions.  If I resend the transaction, but with a higher fee, it is replaced with the new transaction.  This doesn't allow me to reverse the transaction though.*
*In addition, the proposal, lets me change the outputs, as long as I up the fee.*
*This means I can send a tx to you with 0.01 fee and then revers with with a 0.02 fee.*
*All this requires that it hasn't been incorporated in a block.  Once it is in a block, then it is locked down (unless that block is orphaned).*
*Full replacement allows people to update a transaction if it is not being included in the chain.  It would also act to discourage people accepting transactions, until at least one block confirmation happens, since until it is confirmed, it is easy to reverse.*

You can not add a new and cool feature to the voting process at the expense of the supervision. It's not something that we can leave behind.

The attacker can only try the PIN 3 or 4 times, after that the application asks for the full password.
The PIN is checked online, so there's no way the attacker can get more attempts by doing anything to the phone.

In particular, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. This  guidance addresses "convertible" virtual currency. This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency.~~

There was a suggestion for bitcoin client developers to encrypt a dummy file with the same encryption key as the wallet. Doing that if the user needed a service like the one on this post he could send the dummy file.
That way the wallet would be always on the hands of the user and the key could be brute forced using the dummy file.
If I recall correctly the Armory Developer said he would implement it, I hope others follow.

Email spoofing makes sense when the user needs to click an url or send a form from inside the email, since the email "from" might be forget but the user will send it's user information to another domain which is the attacker's domain.
In this case the way to respond to this email is using the "reply" button and if this reply goes to mtgox.com domain then there should be not much of a security problem unless it's an inside job from an attacker working for mtgox.
Just ensure that there's no "reply to" or something like that which redirects the response outside mtgox.

Yes it is.
If the coins where not divisible then yes, eventually we could ran off.
But since the protocol can be updated to allow more divisions then the only possible event to loose all the coins would be to loose them all at once. Otherwise the coins left would be divided and there total amount of "units" would be replenished.
We say there are only 21 million but we could also say that there are 2.100.000.000.000.000 satoshis or minimum units. And if we divide the satoshi then we get more minimum units that must be also lost in order to loose them all.

The wallet has a pool of addresses pregenerated and every time you ask for a new one it uses one of the pool and generates a new one at the bottom of the list.
At any time you are using 100 addresses in your wallet, even if you don't know it.
I have not looked closely at the encryption implementation but most probably it applies the same password to all the wallet, so to all the addresses, by default.
If it then let's you put a different password per address, which I don't know if you can, then it will apply the new encryption to the selected addresses leaving the pool with the "main password".
It would be a huge security mistake to leave the change addresses unencrypted when you ask to encrypt the wallet, since an attacker could steal them and use them at a later time.

Again, the problems are how this service is funded and what kind of assurance the client has if the bank is robbed.
With a traditional bank most countries are backing the funds stored in the bank. If the bank is robbed the client does not loose a dime, if the bank goes bankrupt the client gets up to 100.000€ from the state (in the UE), etc.
Right now if a "bitcoin bank" is robbed the client looses al his bitcoins. Just like that. They can explain that they suspect of a security guy who run off or whatever but the client get's nothing.
So asking a "bitcoin bank" to store your bitcoins is having faith that the bank will not be robbed. While storing your fiat money in the bank is having faith that the financial system will be in place, it doesn't matter to you what happens with the bank (unless you have huge amounts of money, which most of the people don't).

It's quite different accepting bitcoins for a service than accepting them for donations.
When you design a service you set a price expecting to cover the expenses and returning a profit. If there is too much variation in the price you can end up loosing money or having a too expensive service, also it might be a problem changing the price for existing users or setting a different price for new ones, etc.
Accepting donations has none of that. The donor is the one choosing the amount and there is no expectations on their part.

Can you walk me, step by step, on how the vote is given to the voter, what happens when the voter gets it's vote until it uses it?
Because you keep telling me that all that process could be supervised in a way at least as good as current voting supervision and I really don't see how.
And you say the voter will generate it's private key and, somehow, he receives his "blank" vote and somehow this can be supervised, and maybe in your mind is all clear but the step by step process is not clear to me at all.

Most QR Code scanners show you the contents in plain text, which you can copy/paste to, for example, lastpass and then when needed recreate the QR Code using that string.

You are doing it backwards.
Why there's only a 50% of population in Cyprus who uses the Internet and yet almost 100% of population uses banks?
Because banks give them a service they want to use, if banks had no money in it no one would use them. It sounds stupid but is not.
If Internet give people money which it's not going to loose value over time, as fiat does, and gives them a tool that allows them to buy things cheaper then 100% of people would use it. Internet may be not useful enough for that people now, so they don't use it, but if it becomes useful they will.
There are more problems that could affect bitcoin as a global currency, like the availability of Internet in remote areas or the resilience of Internet against failures or directed attacks (right now in a war Internet can be shutdown easily by an enemy). But those are not reasons to wait, to expect those to be fixed first, on the contrary. People and the states will be willing to put more money into fixing those problems if their economy depends on it that they do right now.
Bitcoin is an indirect way to make the Internet available to anyone, as a necessity more than a luxury, and to make it less dependable from the control of some countries as a national security measure, and so forth.

Yes there is. Every step of the voting is supervised by the different parties which can be elected.
Even international supervisors can see if there is fraud or not.
But my example was wrong, you could count the votes emitted so that could not happen.
What could happen is for example this:
The government has all the private keys, since they are the ones with the votes, there's no way to know if the government spends those coins or if it's the voter. In fact, the not spent coins of people who doesn't want to participate could be spent by the government in favor of their candidate.
And that goes also for the stolen votes.
And about getting a 100% participation .... good luck. It simply doesn't happen, no matter how hard you try. We are talking about making a 40% of the people with the right to vote do something that they don't want to do.

It does not eliminate it but it might contain it.
When people have FIAT money they know it looses value as time goes by (one dollar from today will have about 80% of value in 10 years and 10% in 50%). So the money goes to other places where the value stays or increases.
One of the big problems which repeats itself over the years is the real state bubbles. People invest in houses to store their value and it's price increases. People that really needs a house can not buy it or they spend all their live doing it.
Then the bubble bursts and creates a crisis in the country.
We see that in almost every country at different times and intervals.
With bitcoin the currency itself does not loose value, so there's no reason to invest in things like houses.
It might affect other inversions as well like new businesses, but it will not change the fact that if we want to eat we will spend our coins, also to pay the rent or a house. Money will be spent but the priorities might change.

I don't think "they" are sufficiently organized worldwide to act as a whole, I don't even think "they" talk to each other at all.
I think we will see important decisions about bitcoin coming from the US, the EU, China, etc. and all will be different, maybe slightly maybe radically different. And this differences will still allow bitcoin to grow in some directions in some countries. And this would be a victory, a slow growing path but a growing path. 
That's why I don't believe one year will be decisive for bitcoin, maybe decisive for bitcoin in the US, or for bitcoin in the UE, but not for bitcoin in general.
And if bitcoin keeps growing, no matter were, it keeps having options for a big success in the future.
Most countries know already that a full prohibition is not a good choice, so they will try to regulate it as we have been seeing. And that's good because even with difficulties of getting to comply the regulations there's still paths to keep growing.
I have a hard time thinking in success percentages. But I would say there's a 95% chance that countries will not get organized against bitcoin, a 50% chance that it will not be prohibited in any major economy, a 90% chance that it will not be prohibited in all major economies .... so I believe this gives bitcoin a good chance of a partial success in the near future somewhere and a slightly lower chance of a big success on the long term everywhere.

It's fine, I didn't want to criticize the current service just to do an intellectual exercise on how to make multisig addresses work in this scenario.
I really believe multisig addresses might be the foundation of a game changer new service which could eventually help bitcoin succeed, they have a lot of potential.
Just keep the idea for the future, if it has no fatal flaws, and decide if it is fit to implement it later on.
By the way I think it would be appropriate to add a response in the FAQ answering how this service is funded. To me not knowing where the service gets it's money to keep running makes me suspicious, even if it only says that is free to help bitcoin succeed it's better than nothing.
Again not criticizing the service nor doing unfunded accusations, just a thought from someone who likes the idea, even if I don't see a use for myself right now, and thinks about the way to improve it.

I believe in the future business addresses shall be listed in some kind of official list. So that buyers can prove that they are the owners of the source wallet and can prove that the business is the owner of the destination wallet.
Of course if the destination address is publicly shown on the webpage and it's always the same that shall be enough for now.
Then it would be the business the one who would have to prove that they sent the product or that the service was indeed done in case of a dispute.
I guess the actual laws are enough to protect the buyer if it comes to a trial, but it would be better to have more explicit regulations so judges don't have to deal with the newness of all this.

Google discarded the idea of making his own Google Bucks because of the regulations and the legal complexity of creating money.
Facebook has exactly the same problem.
The big advantage of Bitcoin is that there's no one to blame and no one to prosecute. The businesses around Bitcoin, like the exchanges, services, stores, etc. must comply with the legislation only for what they do, and if they fail to do it bitcoin does not get affected at all, only that business specifically.
Facebook would not be able to ignore government control of his money, probably they would end up with a fixed parity of 1 Facecoin = 1 Dollar or something like that. Which would make Facecoin no more than a dollar with a fancy name.

Google Authenticator supports a QR Code reader integrated in the application.
So just selecting "Configure Account" will ask you to install the supported QR Code if it's not installed.
This is the supported QR Code scanner: 
I don't know what happens on Mt. Gox if you loose your phone. As a safe precaution you can capture the QR Code with another applications and store this in a secure place (like lastpass). So you can reconstruct the QR Code in the future if you need, and configure it on another phone.

That's not a real problem. The developer's team had already stated every once and then that the scripts will be enabled when someone needs them.
I don't know if in testnet those scripts are already enabled, but I'm sure they would be enabled if you ask them to do it. Or you can run a testnet-in-a-box and enable them yourself.
Once you have a working solution which takes advantage of one of the disabled scripts then they have no reason not to enable them, once they do all the security evaluation to ensure the network is secure.
It would be a problem if you, or someone else, had already done all this process and the developers denied the petition to enable those scripts on the main network.
As long as I know this has not happened yet.
This discussion might be an example of what we are talking about: 
TLDR; A tiny change on testnet is not agreed since it is in a "too early" development stage and some developers who want to keep testnet as close as the production net as possible. The testnet-in-a-box is still an option for that "too early" development stage.

It's not a flaw in bitcoin as it's not a flaw in dollars which can also be stolen and no one is tracking it's serial numbers.
When you use a Credit Card you are paying for the service and the security, there's really nothing which stops any company to offer the same paid services on bitcoin. Future web wallets might charge you a little more and insure your wallet from fraudulent use.
Also there are other technical solutions which are on their way, like physical wallets where the computer can not access the private key and you must approve any transaction with a touch of a button after confirming the amount and destination on an integrated display.
It's still too soon to be all in place.
The solution I'm using right now is an offline computer with Armory client on it, and the online computer with a read only wallet which can make transactions as long as those get signed using the offline computer.
Also the offline computer has the filesystem encrypted with a strong password so if it get's lost or stolen I can use a backup wallet to get the coins out of there before anyone can crack it.

Just be aware of the risks. A money transaction sometimes can be reversed, Paypal does it for example. While a bitcoin transaction can not.
So you should have some trust on the services or person that sends you the money if the way the money changes hands can be reversed.

Yeah, I understand that it's easier for the merchant to have a unique address per client/order so they know exactly who paid what.
It's a shame we can not add a text to the transaction, so the buyer could send the money to a general known address and add a description with the order number just like the bank transfers.
Maybe another solution would be that before sending the money the buyer could download some message signed by the merchant that indicated the destination address, so in case of dispute the buyer could prove that this message was signed by the merchant and it contained the destination address where the funds were sent.
This feature could be integrated in the client as something like "signed destination address" or something meaningful like that.

It's about when your money is available to spend. If you want to be able to spend it right away then as you access your web wallet you can send your money to another wallet. So can an attacker if he has control of your computer or your password.
The web wallet service can have cold storage to protect most of the funds but keeps a hot wallet with enough funds for you to spend yours. And for the hacker to spend yours as well.
A web wallet which does not have your funds prepared to be spent right away may seem a little unnerving for the user, since it might make him think that the day he asks for their funds they'll say no to him. I don't know of any web wallet that offers this kind of service, which would be what you where talking about.
So the cold storage used right now on web wallets it's focused mostly on protecting the service as a whole and to minimize the losses in case of a vulnerability, but will not protect you specifically from someone stealing your wallet. Unless the attacker is stealing from a lot of wallets at once since then the hot wallet will get empty before he can steal much.
And there are also web wallets on which the service has no access to your funds and does not know how much bitcoins are you storing, the service just stores an encrypted wallet which contains all your bitcoins and which is unencrypted on your browser. That could be stored as a cold wallet but that would mean you could not spend any of your funds without requesting all your wallet to be retrieved from cold storage. Again I don't know anyone offering that kind of service.

I doubt you can brute force a 9 digits random password on an online service.
It's not secure for an offline file as the attacker can bruteforce a ton of combinations in no time, but any decent online service can detect and stop any brute force attempt.
His problem doesn't seem to be the password complexity but it's lack of double authentication. It doesn't matter how complex is your password if the attacker can capture it.

I think the Online Wallets are the ones already positioned to offer that kind of service.
They probably will never call themselves "banks" as this is a name with unwanted connotations, but their services can evolve to add services that we find in banks like:
- Security measures
- Availability
- Insurance measures, if your money is stolen they assume the it.
- Automatic payments (rent, electricity bills, etc.)
Right now there are two kind of online wallets, those that have access to your wallet and those who not (even those who not can eventually access it, it is easy and has been done).
The ones who have access to your wallet can offer that kind of services right away. And those who have not access could add a new "shared" wallet with enough money to pay those services, like what we have now in Banks, the "normal" bank account and the savings bank account or the deposits.

I was going to give you the silent treatment, as is the best respect I can show to someone who makes a stupid move like gambling or buying lottery. Yes, I live in a lonely world with almost no one to talk ;-)
But no, there's something interesting in your case. As you said you don't usually go to casinos nor gamble and yet this time you did. Probably the bitcoins are part to blame, at least knowing how our mind works.
When you go to a casino you first change your money for chips. There's a very good reason for that, chips are not money an yet they are. People who would never put a thousand dollars in a roulette number would do it in chips, since are not money. Yet they are.
For most people bitcoins are more chips than money. We know  that have a USD value and yet we are not reminded enough when we spend it.
You said you never go to the casinos and yet when you changed USD for bitcoin in your mind you entered into some big casino, where you could use your chips to get things, or worse, to try to get lucky.
I think this might become a real problem for most people when using bitcoins, they will loose the sense of the value of those and they will spend it with not enough though.
There's not much we can do about it except being very conscious about it, this you already did at a cost, and try to educate people on that fact as much as we can.

If it's a bug that has a negative impact on the majority of the users then making the change, fixing the bug, is fairly easy.
You just need to publish the fixed version and almost everyone will accept it.

That's not entirely true. Security depends on various factors.
A sentence like the one on the title may give the user a false sense of security. Let's try to be more cautious.

7 billion alternative coins would be too much.
None would be to few.
So a number in between.

~~Only if he has 100% of hashing power, with 51% he can only get 51% of fresh bitcoins, 49% keep being statistically awarded to the other miners.~~


~~Bitcoins would still be mined by the attacker, so the network would be fine. Maybe not, but not for this reason.~~


~~Yes, that would be a problem, with a 51% it would be quite risky for the attacker, as it goes up it get's easy. 51% is not all or nothing, it's just that gets easier to do it than with 30% and it's still harder to do it than with 80%.~~


~~This only makes sense with near 100%, otherwise 4 out of 10 blocks will have those excluded transactions. Which is fine really.~~


~~Again, with a 51% hashing power that would be quite a stupid thing to do, with 90% still 1 out of 10 blocks would have transactions. High fee transactions probably.~~

And better if that machine is never online, using offline transactions when needed (Armory makes this very easy).

It might also be from South America or somewhere else.
Spanish is spoken by 400 million people around the world while in Spain there are only 46 million of those.
By the way I'm from Spain and I do browse this subreddit. Yet I have my browser configured with english as default language so I don't know if I got counted there.
Edit: Also english on my reddit preferences. So probably not counted there.

Of course not. Taxes don't tax the currency, they tax the economic activity.
Bitcoins will never be tax free, the gobernment might have a hard time following the money if they can at all, but if they detect money transfers they will ask for the taxes. Which will have to be paid in the only currency accepted, what they call "real money" :-)

Very important answer: Nobody knows.
Hint: Don't use random computers to print paper wallets.

You cannot change the blockchain. So if you send the funds to a well-known charity bitcoin address it can be confirmed by anyone. 
Also, as I understand it, the "announce-commit sacrifice" can also be verified by anyone.

If the computer has been compromised how can you know that the transaction you are signing has the correct address and the correct amount?
It doesn't seem safe enough to me.
The idea of this card is quite similar to the Visa/Mastercard credit cards, but there's an essential difference. With Visa/Mastercard there's a company which receives the transaction and decides to approve or decline the operation based on some rules and limits. If there's a dispute the transaction can be reversed.
With bitcoin there's no such thing, the shop could steal all the funds from the electronic card and you could not notice until later and you would have no way to reverse the transaction.

If you use Dual Boot then the "offline" partition should be encrypted.
If you do not encrypt it an attacker could get access to the partition from the online operating system and get access to the wallet, if it were not encrypted, or install malware on the offline partition and use it to get the wallet next time you use it.

Can you explain how bitfloor has scammed you?
Just asking, the last person I heard saying something like that did not know the difference between business days and natural days.

The one swipe should at least need a button click just before the swipe, son an attacker couldn't get a payment when the wallet is inside your pocket.
Remember that the "near" from the NFC it's relative to a lot of factors, technology might allow "near" to be 1 meter,  10 meters or 1 km.

I believe in case the merchant keeps the signed transaction and does not send it to the network (he looses it or something like that) the client should be able to cancel that transaction.
One way would be the signed transaction having an expiration date so the bitcoin network would not accept it after that.
Another way, more expensive, would be for the client's wallet to keep a record of the inputs used on that transaction and spend any of them to himself, doing a "double-spend" attempt. This would invalidate the original transaction but the client might need to pay network fees for that.

Last time I checked it was as easy as sending a SEPA transfer to Mt. Gox. Once verified you can check on "adding funds" and the SEPA information for the transfer should be there.
Be advise that you must send euros and not any other currency or the banks will convert it to euros and charge you for that.

When you buy cheese do you ask for 0.0002 tonnes of it or for 200 grams?
When you measure your car gas mileage do you use light years or miles? (or kilometers)
There's no problem if in the future a bitcoin is the equivalent of a light year, we could always use another smaller units related to a bitcoin.
The problem doing what you propose is that you would need to always check the date of any legal document which contained any bitcoin unit, since you would need to know if it was written before or after the multiplication.
