I'm trying to learn more about the market and it's potential instead of just blindly hodling like I've been doing lately. I've been reading about ETF's and was wondering what would be the benefit of investing in ETF's or even futures for that matter? Is it just an entry point for Wall Street? Is there any reason for the layman to buy into an ETF if it ever got approved opposed to just buying coin?

So is there any real need to expedite the transaction if I'm not intending on using it on the exchange? Like once it's removed does my money just disappear, or does it go back to my original wallet?

What happens to a transaction if I put the fee too low? Does it just sit in limbo, or does it eventually reverse? I was decently high last night and tried moving funds to an exchange, but now changed my mind, but I put the fee at like 50 sat/bytes, so don't see it going through anytime soon.

Past experiences does not equal future results

It's still an irrelevant comparison.

From what I've learned from my short time on crypto subreddits is that ppl have their own agendas, and those honestly trying to help are just trading by gut feeling. Only advice I feel comfortable giving is do your own research to the best of your ability, and try not to let emotions play into your financial decisions. Take everything you read with a grain of salt because the person you take advice from may be trying to sway you for their own gain, or more likely, they overestimate their comprehension of what they say. Lastly, invest only what you can lose because at the end of the day crypto is really fun and interesting, but still insanely volatile. 
Edit: pretty much nobody can predict the market, and those that can are directly manipulating it.

Look at the prices man, we are on our way out of the woods. At the end of the day use your best judgement, and look at both sides of every argument. And if you feel like you're stressing out, you either have too much invested in such a volatile asset, or you just aren't cut out for crypto in its current state. If you do choose to stay, then learn to manage your stress and never panic sell/buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:54:52
You should buy some

You're a pretty cool dude, you know that? I WISH I could be as cool as you. You're probably sitting there in your leather jacket smoking a cigarette not giving one care. You cool dude you.

"I wish I never created this Reddit account" must have been the most taxingtwo days of your life, huh?
Edit: look at this idiots post history, two questions within two hours and then comes bitching about neither of them being answered. Ppl were trying to help and explain to him, but no, not good enough. Fuckin FUD bullshit

Gdax is great choice due to the low fees. You really shouldn't ask for advice from strangers because you have no idea how much they know, and if they genuinely want what's best for you. As fun as timing the market can feel, you should always be aware that crypto is extremely volatile, and subject to unpredictable swings in either direction. What you might think is a dip is really just the beginning of a crash, or what you think is an All Time High is left in the dust never to be seen again. Do your research and avoid any panic perpetuated by those who only want your money. If you truly believe in the future of bitcoin, then now is always the best time to buy. If this thing succeeds you will not regret buying in at the current price.

Glad to hear it man. This was my first major dip holding btc, and I completely understand all the panic you had lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:45:05
I find it funny how people pick out the one crash of a self driving car when I drive by ditches riddled with cars on a regular basis
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:58:47
Propagating fear isn't funny

I have never listened to an ad and I never will. These types of ads are no different than the ones telling me how to work from home or add 3 in to my dick.

Im honestly confused as to which generation you're mad at

Following the trends like a sheep to Ver's slaughter house

Same man. Both sides are convinced the other is brainwashed, and I'm completely lost for how things will play out. I bought in after the bch fork, so I'm just holding my btc and hoping it comes out of this the dominant chain. I tried to do my own research, but It's hard to sift through bias when money is involved lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:02:20
A part of me wants it to crash to $755 solely for the meme
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:07:07
Can you explain what exactly determines mining difficulty? Why did it become more profitable for miners to switch from bch back to btc?
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:02:11
Sorry for being stupid, but how is airbitz gonna treat the fork? Will I get both coins? And if I do, how can I exchange one for more of the other?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:08:54
Not only wrong, but intentionally misleading
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:57:28
In case nobody better informed chimes in, the way I understand it is that with LN multiple p2p tx's can be made without needing to be confirmed by the blockchain. This removes congestion by providing a way to complete multiple transactions without needing every single micro transaction be verified; only the final exit balance is confirmed by the blockchain. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, it's just how I wrapped my head around it.
Edit: a way to look at it is if you and I had ongoing payments, instead of subjecting each micropayment to the fees of the main blockchain avenue, we could create a multisig address that requires us both to agree on each transaction balance that doesn't get broadcasted until one of us disagrees with a tx or closes the address
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:06:14
Really hope you didn't lose that much man. And hopefully there's lessons learned through all of this

No, first mistake was trading with emotions. You need to chill, it may look obvious now, but at the time I'm sure there was legitimate reason to think it was smart. He admits it was a mistake, and his post is helping new people stressing about their money 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:38:51
Thanks. Just started looking into it, so wouldn't know the details anyways. Glad I'm on the right track
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:36:30
It literally doesn't matter what you do with your $30
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:08:36
They probably ruined a lot of people's lives to put themselves a little higher on their scoreboards. I do not respect these criminals
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:40:06
Same here man. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:30:15
Sorry man. Hopefully you didn't ruin yourself, and can just consider it a costly lesson of emotional trading. I genuinely feel bad for the people fucked over by these fat cats 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:29:33
I agree with you 100% that ppl were foolish doing it, but I also hold empathy for these people cuz I'm not a sociopath like ver and co
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:24:13
Also is it a good time for newcomers to buy coins? What are the possibilities market wise?
