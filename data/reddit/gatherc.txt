That was my concern as well but there is also an option to encrypt your seed with a password:

Backup and syncing (eg sync between your phone and tablet) is a huge benefit for authy. Google authenticator just sits on your phone and if you lose or reformat the phone it's a huge pain to reset all the sites where you use 2fa.

thanks for your reply, yes I also discovered the github parsing which is good enough; if the need for a pdf grows too high I'll figure it out :)

suppose you have a paper wallet with bip38 encryption of the private key: you could scan the public key in Mycelium as watch-only (mycelium does not have access to the private key). If you want to spend/transfer the money from that wallet, you can scan the private key with Mycelium, key in your bip38 password and your paper wallet is unlocked. 
So yeah, those are two separate features, a wallet which supports watch-only but doesn't support bip38 can't be used to spend bip38 encrypted paper wallets. Hope that helped :)

we've made the same observation in our meetup group, price effect on attendance seems less than it used to be. 
Unfortunately many variables have been changed at once so it's hard to pinpoint the cause: we also started advertising our meetups on meetup.com (used to be only on bitcointalk), a growing group or regulars, more visitors from nearby meetups, etc.

A wonder of well-wordedness.

Same here, we're on a spending spree and mycelium transactions are appearing/disappearing. Really annoying! Hope it's fixed soon.

1 BTC donation, thank you kind stranger! It will be put to good use.

Business to business there are no chargebacks, b2c there is indeed a certain period. I think it is possible to work out something here, would be really handy.

Indeed, applications like this make the oneplus two a no buy for me

are the slides available somewhere? Could use them for a presentation in a hackerspace in a few weeks, good intro for the money perspective

We're having some issues with the bitpay payments at the moment, if you want to test the site please try it with a free address, should by fixed by tomorrow.

good tip, we'll add them to our todo list!

Correct of course, but for certain use cases such as donation addresses or paper wallets I find it an acceptable practice. If there's interest, bulk vanity addresses are possible ;)
