No he’s actually correct; nobody past the release date buys a Samsung unless given heavy discounts.

Well yeah; if you put it that way. I bought the iPhone X 256gb on Swappa for $950, I can sell that back at good or mint condition for $850. Not bad after using it for over 6 months. I can use that money to buy a base model iPhone xs max to resale or use until price drops on higher storage ones.

Take the time to reflect on yourself; I toke two similar sized phones with the same storage and compared the pros and cons. If you can’t comprehend somebody else opinion or insight why are you on a online forum!?

Better car examples would be Kia vs Lexus. Android are like Kias; their owners swear that it’s the same or better than other brand. But their resell is horrible, people don’t want be caught walking out from it, and Kias improvements in quality can’t negate the stigma associated with it by previous models years ago. A Lexus is the most reliable in the industry, but boring to use. Toyota has the best service and is the most respected company in the car industry. Able to afford their own research and development making different, but generally the same product for different uses and sizes. Apple and Toyota have perfected mass production of their products; that until you own a tool which is what these products are! Other people wouldn’t understand.

External SD cards should not be a factor in the equation. If comparing them by exact built in storage of 512gb the iPhone xs max is still faster and better quality for $200 dollars more; given iPhones ability to retain value longer over a period of time its the better choice.
