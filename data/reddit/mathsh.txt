Haha.  I worded that poorly, I understand supply and demand :p
What I don't get is why miners are still maintaining the system.  It seems like that would mean less value if the maintenance gets more difficult.
The miners must mine to verify the block, correct?

Thanks.  I'll take a look when I have time.

I see.  Thanks for answering my question intelligently and not treating me like a retard.
One follow up question: My understanding of transaction fees was that they were optional.  Is that incorrect?  Do some wallets make them mandatory?

Right I understood that.  My confusion was with the inventive to mine, and how that decreasing would affect the system as a whole.

What is stopping something better than bitcoin from coming along and killing bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:35:38
No, but mining gold is not required for the trade of already mined gold to function.  Apples and oranges.
Edit:  to respond to your undeclared edit, truffles are consumed, while BTC is created and stays in circulation.  And again, farming truffles isn't necessary for already farmed truffles to be traded or sold.  I guess you could say that they go bad after time, but again, apples and oranges.

I see.  That makes sense.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:43:31
That makes sense, I was not aware that miners could pick and choose like that.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:50:38
I see.  I must have skimmed over that detail my first read.

Good lick, indeed ��
