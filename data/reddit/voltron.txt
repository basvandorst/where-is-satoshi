So if someone calls your office you can take the call or ignore it. No accountability. Theoretically if it were on the blockchain creating an immutable document of the call your congress person would be obligated to not only reply but document the reply. In effect greater transparency and a more effective congress person and hopefully something would actually be done and not get lost in the shuffle.  
"Politicians will no longer be able to feign ignorance on votes that go against their riding’s wishes as they will be publicly accessible on the blockchain. Whether or not politicians are swayed by public sentiment is another issue altogether, however the key point to take away is that transparency in government can significantly improve with blockchain technology."

I was asked to supply all of that information and more which I did. Including a letter from may bank confirming I had an account in good standing with them. For some reason even though that was more than enough for other exchanges they deemed it necessary to verify my phone number.
I guess this is why I am so down on them as there seems to be no consistency or oversight of their policies. I feel like if it's this difficult to set up a verified account with them why should I be trusting them? I know many others who have had good experiences with them but for some reason I have a difficult time dealing with them. Apparently no other way to verify me without being able to immediately answer a one time random phone call without having to restart the process again. That's what I'm talking about. Glad it's working for you and others but I wanted to point out my experience for any other people thinking of using them.

To be fair they are actually the only real exchange in Canada not the largest, just the only. Yes there are others but they are not full fledged exchanges like QuadrigaCX is.
Whenever I call customer service it seems to be staffed by one person and usually you have to leave a voicemail that encourages in person visits. Compared to any other exchange that I've dealt with including the smaller other non Canadian exchanges the service seems very small time.
Everyone was nice and I understand just following policy. I don't have a complaint regarding that per se but if I can set up verification on any other exchange in a matter of days and be authorized to make large purchases why is it so difficult to even get me authorized to make a deposit online? That seems rinky dink. The only apparent way around this is for me to be accessible on the phone for an entire week when the random call might possibly come in. Tell me how there isn't something wrong there.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:13:33
QuadrigaCX seems like a good place to invest but honestly the operation seems so small time. The verification process is weak at best and getting verified to be able to do any transactions that would be more convenient than using EZBTC or QUICKBT is next to impossible if you have a life. I've been trying to get verified for a while and even though I am verified easily on many other exchanges with the same documents QuadrigaCX requires a random phone call screening. If you are not there the moment they decide to call you you have to start the process all over again. Even when I contacted support the operation seems very rinky dink. It's more of a clear indication that someone needs to fill a very large whole in the Canadian marketplace.

I'm sure there are plenty of solutions and compromise on both sides to stop the risk of centralization (which red herring or not I still see it as a potential problem from both sides). So I guess, in regards to centralization, what I'm wondering is can both or either sides be trusted to keep bitcoin from becoming centralized. I would see it as a huge problem if it went that way going forward and fundamentally opposed to what bitcoin means and stands for. Is it really an argument that needs to be overlooked? Am I worried about the wrong issue here?

You have 0 confirmations and you can click on the link under Transaction ID to see the status of the transaction. Was it a conversion using Shapeshift or did you just send it to yourself? Sometimes Shapeshift takes a while to complete the confirmations and if you selected the cheapest/slowest fee you could be waiting up until a day or more for it to confirm.

Jaxx is a completely safe wallet that allows you to store the keys meaning you are in control of your funds. While Bittrex is a good exchange I would never encourage anyone to keep their money on an exchange over a personal wallet type. Do some research to find which one serves your needs best. While it's true that there are more secure wallets than Jaxx it is a good wallet as long as you follow all the directions and instructions regarding safe keeping your funds and is the best multi-currency wallet on the market IMO.

True but having unestablished and unknown entities holding them is far riskier than owning them yourself. While the model works for people unfamiliar or new to the market unless you completely trust the owner of those keys I would say the risk is higher trusting third parties over yourself. While it is true people are free to judge risk for themselves I personally disagree with stating that it's a decentralized model when the owner of your keys is not yourself. Decentralization literally means no one in control. If you hold someone else's keys you are in control and it's just as centralized as banks at that point because like banks you are still trusting someone else not to run away with your funds. I'm not saying that freewallet is doing this but what happens if freewallet suddenly were to cease operations? What would be great is if freewallet offered the option to work either way. I would imagine user adoption would soar.

@_date: 2017-11-07 14:50:50


Actually I do get to know my family doctor personally (or at least on some level) before going to them for a check up. While I think I get your point. My point is that you are operating no different from banks. If two people are holding their private keys they are interacting with each other. If you are holding the private keys you are essentially in the middle of our deal and you actually have control or a say in what happens. Correct me if I am wrong but there hasn't been a lot of transparency in regards to who is even running the company. I and most people see that as a red flag. At least with companies like coinbase you know who is in charge. It even took forever to figure out where your company was located. Your company isn't exactly a model of transparency which leads to a lot of questions and trust issues.
When I asked about freewallet ceasing operations I wasn't really talking about something like a "force majeur". While it is good to know that you have all of those protocols in place what if, and here's where the lack of transparency comes in, freewallet decided to pull an exit scam and just steal everyone's money because they held all the private keys. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume there is no malicious intent but tell me it's not at least a possibility? 
So between lack of transparency of freewallet and the fact that you hold all your users private keys is what shoots up the red flag. You have a really great design but your company would see better adoption rates if you allowed users to hold their keys as well as being more transparent. Good luck to you in your future endeavors.

When the mempool is high fees will be high. If you select a lower fee during this time you’ll likely be SOL having your transaction processed. If you don’t believe me import your wallet to any other service and you’ll see the fees will be the same. Jaxx has nothing to do with fee prices as such. Those are determined by miners available vs transaction amounts.

It's been a while since I used coinbase tbh but I do believe the fee structure is fairly similar with each price. If memory serves it worked out to be slightly better to buy your maximum on each purchase. However prices can fluctuate frequently so it could make more sense to buy each week (spread the price volatility out) but sometimes you can get lucky and do a large monthly buy at a good price too. It's hard to say for sure what the right move is in each moment. If you want to check the fees on coinbase the best thing to do is at the time of buying see what they are based on different price points without placing the order. It should show up in the fees section when you are placing the buy and you can feel out what you think is worth it.

My experience has been just putting whatever I could afford into it. I treated it like a savings account to begin with. In the beginning I was concerned with how much more expensive it seemed every time it went up a bit but over the course of a year I started to realize it didn't matter so much. Eventually I started to catch on how to read candle stick charts and could monitor trends a bit better. Seeing when things were going up and when it was going down. By then I was confident in the market as a whole to know that it was on solid footing so I would always attempt to buy in the downtrends when I could. You'll never get it perfect so don't worry about it too much (especially in the beginning). Sometimes it's just enough to know that in the grand scheme you've made the right choice when you choose to buy into bitcoin.
While I can't say for sure if today's price is the best price I know down the line this price, from my experience, that even if you bought in high on the short term after a bit of time you'll be wishing you could pay that high price again instead of the higher high it is in the present.

Definitely harder than it needs to be. Sorry to hear of your troubles. If you are in a jam always know that you can send money to yourself through bylls.com heck you can even actually just pay your bills with bitcoin through them. No banks necessary.

@_date: 2017-10-31 18:18:37
Easiest way is to get yourself a coinbase account. Great for first time users. Get comfortable with it there and start doing your own research. You'll eventually want to use a wallet that holds your own private keys and find an exchange with better rates that you feel comfortable using. If you want to start doing it sooner rather than later I would start with coinbase. It's not the best but for ease of use and understanding it's probably the best.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:34:06
I signed up for coinsquare.io but have never used it. Whenever I compare rates against quickbt.com they were always much higher. During high periods of price fluctuation I see the rates on quickbt.com being a bit out of whack. Best thing to do is to either keep checking it as prices level off and you can get a better rate or to try and buy when the market is relatively flat. There's really no way you're going to ever get a Canadian company offering the price that bitcoin actually is so you're best bet is to shop around and find the lesser of evils and go with that given that getting verified on US exchanges is difficult to impossible now. Best of luck to all my fellow canucks out there.

I have an account with Quadriga CX. I have been verified by Quadriga CX. However I have not actually used it because the reason I signed up was so I could have the easy ability of funding an account or purchasing large amounts of BTC with my debit card. Unfortunately they have continuously denied me the ability to do that and will only accept wire transfers from my bank at present. I have never gotten a clear answer as to why that is for me. I also have known others that are in the same position with them with no rhyme or reason given as to why that option is not available to them. I do know others who have the ability but they had been using it before I had signed up. I'm not sure if that is something they are phasing out for new customers or not as the customer support end was not very helpful in finding a way to rectify the situation for myself or others I have known. Good luck and I hope you get verified and approved for Interac purchases quickly.
One thing I will mention is to be aware and check on their rates for purchasing or selling. From my memories they were not the best rates and I remember at the time thinking Kraken seemed like a more economical option.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:18:00
Yes but if you are having difficulty buying from other locations an 8% fee (which fluctuates) is still competitive. In regards to the daily limit it applies to BTC, ETH and LTC respectively so technically you can buy about $750/day as you can always convert those assets after the fact.
If you use the service enough you will also be invited to the pro tier which unlocks $1000/day caps.
I’m not sure what other options are on the table for you but it has always worked out for me in a pinch. 
If you have the time to get verified by an exchange do that but in the meantime this has always been a favourable solution to me. Hope it helps.

Every time it jumps people keep thinking they've missed the boat. Oh it's too high now; it's too late to get in and yet another rise after another rise happens and it's only been going up over time. I keep telling them it's not too late but what are you gonna do?

Happy to have helped and feel free to reach out and if I can help or offer any advice I will. That being said reddit is an amazing resource for all things crypto.
The trick (if there is one) with coinbase is spotting the moments when they buy bitcoin. So for instance if the price has been high for a while the markup on the price you are buying it from them will be reflective of that price. If you are buying just as it is beginning to rise you will notice the markup is smaller. You're never going to always get it right so best not to worry about it too much. Just observe for a bit and you'll start to notice trends and tricks on your own. You made the first step and bought some so you're already at the party now scope it out and enjoy.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:42:21
Every place that sells charges a fee. Whatever the ticker says the likely hood of you getting it at that exact price are nil. They are not "big" fees. They are just the cost of doing business. The amount of effort you have to go through to calculate the fees, conversion and charting that go into day trading and not even accounting for being wrong on your predictions are just too much hassle. The best thing to do is to make regular buys eventually those fees won't even be a concern.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:52:17
I know it's not the best for trying to get a lot in at once but it is pretty quick and easy to use. I would maybe try emailing them and asking if it's possible to unlock the pro level of the site for you. They have always been quick and helpful whenever I've reached out.

Coinbase holds your private keys not you. That means they own your wallet not you. It's fine and safe and I would say coinbase is trustworthy enough but when things like forks happen and you want to be able to claim your newly minted coins from another currency you'll only be able to do it if they release it. If you want to truly own your money you'll want something where you hold your private keys.

Just saying by some stretch if it did see a sharp decline to 1k given the current set of circumstances I doubt it would stay that low for that long. Perhaps prices would not recover for a time to their peaks but I highly doubt 1k would ever be a stable price all things being equal.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:14:28
I would second that as well. Hodl all the way. While it is possible to make money day trading bitcoin I wouldn't recommend it. Sit back and enjoy the ride. There will be ups and downs but do your own research and see what else is out there that compares to the returns bitcoin can give you. Would you rather put money into a bank savings account or would you rather put it in bitcoin? Never buy more than you are willing to lose but I'll bet that your year end returns would be better achieved through bitcoin over any traditional savings or investments.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:32:42
Most wallets should be free of charge. It really just comes down to 1)Do you hold your private keys and 2)Do you like using/understand the wallet. As you get more comfortable with it you will notice other things like securities and protocols the wallets employ. Go ahead download a bunch and play around with them (but never with large amounts until you find what you like and feel safe using). BEWARE ANYTHING BY FREEWALLET - JUST RUN AWAY FROM THEM.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:52:39
That’s the best plan is to get yourself verified at as many exchanges as you feel comfortable with. Do it all now and get verified as it takes a while. That way when you get verified you have options along with the ability to buy and sell more than each individual exchanges caps.  You can also try out a couple and see which ones you like best and find most comfortable to use. I recommend doing small amount transactions in and out at first so you can gauge the time it takes for each exchange to transfer funds. Also make sure you’re not leaving large amounts just sitting on exchanges in the event that they get hacked. The best way to figure out what your doing is to test the waters. Best of luck to you and may fortune find you.

Well there are fees and costs associated with buying and selling not to mention the conversion fees back and forth to fiat. Unless you're buying large amounts it's probably not going to be worth it for the average person. People do do it all the time. It is happening but most people also know that the short term gains that can be made are far outweighed by the long term haul.
Not to mention that you have to be in the right place at the right time. Nothing like getting stuck having to buy back at a higher price than you sold for to teach you that (which can happen very easily with bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:03:18
Even if we did see 1k again how long do you think it will last? Remember when the fork happened and BTC was down below 1K? That didn't last long. Think about everyone who has already adopted bitcoin. Do you think they'd just throw thier hands up and walk away? Probably not. They'd buy the dip and the price would come back up again. Any setback would be temporary at best. Worst case scenario it doesn't recover to the highest points right away. That's my 2 cents worth anyway.

Assuming 
1. Coinbase will accept you as a foreign customer as I've been hearing that they are now turning non-US citizens down. 
2. You can pass the Quadriga CX verification process which took a long time for myself personally and to this date they will only accept bank wires with no Interac online ability. This also is not just the case for me alone. I know some who get in and others who do not.
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:28:41
So not to sound like even more of a shill than I already apparently do but I have used it to sell back to fiat and so far the experience has been just as easy and good. I honestly don’t mean to shill and just wanted everyone to know there is a solution to the current problem of crypto in Canada.
