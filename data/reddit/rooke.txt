All coins sitting at an address that has never spent coins will be safe, since only the hash of the public key is known at that point. Because there is no quantum computing algorithm for fast(er) cryptographic hash guessing (yet) it is no more feasible for a quantum computer to attack an unspent balance than it is for a conventional computer. Not leaving coins in an address will certainly change the status quo, but this behavior is actually promoted in the sense that most wallets send change to new addresses.

The bandwidth necessary to run bitcoind and p2pool to prevent undue orphaning is non-trivial (tens of GB/month). Not all miner hardware is suited to fast block header change (every 30s for p2pool). Running p2pool is not as obviously good as you think, even for the savvy. I absolutely support p2pool use, but do not dismiss these downsides if striving for true decentralization, i.e. not using someone else's node.

That's 4 days to bootstrap a node in a financial system that is doing 2000 transactions per second. If you're running a full node in 2024, and bitcoin is doing 2000 transactions per second, that's *not* a long time considering the scale of such a system. That's a one-time cost of 4 days, assuming a good home internet connection of the future. A full bitcoin node, given those parameters, would no longer be a casual installation.

@_date: 2014-03-12 17:37:11
Right.. and every ASIC produces bitcoin, thus every profitable ASIC (today) has a net present value however low. That value *should* be the net present value of all future bitcoin production (it often isn't because people are stupid or like gambling). If an ASIC is profitable today, it has value. Every bitcoin ASIC already produced thus far is still profitable, thus retains resale value.
Most new bitcoin miner sales are indeed overpriced (that is, their current cost is above the net present value of their amortization). Used miners still have value.
The argument that GPUs are inherently less risky because they have an independent resale potential is certainly true, but their value will approach zero as well, just on a different curve.

p2pool nodes must operate their own bitcoin node. The transaction that is hashed is created by each individual p2pool node, thus decisions about transaction acceptance, fees, etc. are made by each individual node in the p2pool mining pool. 
An all-p2pool world would involve several distinct p2pool networks, as one giant p2pool is just a needlessly complicated version of the original bitcoin mining system.

The *total* cost of mining is currently negative for most, but the *marginal* cost of mining is certainly not; the marginal cost of operation is basically electrical cost. The marginal cost of operating an ASICMiner USB stick is still positive. If you consider the upfront cost of owning hardware as a sunk cost (it's not really, since you can resell it), continuing to operate your miner is profitable. Thus, the hashrate doesn't go down.
The physical analogy is if you've already dug a hole in the ground, you may as well mine whatever you were after until your sales fall below your operating costs (diesel for your trucks, pay for your workers, and electricity to run your mill). Or you could sell the mine to some other sucker. It is not currently profitable to dig another hole, though.

0.5MBits/s sounds like a 'steady-state' value; maximums can be well above 2.0 or 3.0 if multiple clients decide to sync from you. You're reporting an asymmetrical up/down rate *opposite* to what is normal for nodes that have more incoming peers than outgoing, and makes me question what you're reporting. That is, on a typical node you see far more outbound traffic than inbound traffic due to most clients being "leeches", e.g. SPV clients. 
I don't mean to be a nitpicker here, I just want to warn you of the very real problem home internet users typically experience with having a fully-open node with the standard 117 inbound connection slots open. Savvy users can adjust to the extra traffic, but it doesn't make for a true "plug-and-play" experience. It's a longstanding issue:
@_date: 2015-05-21 06:08:37
It's 125 to be exact. You might want to turn that down a little, or warn users that without any router QoS these settings can easily saturate "normal" home internet upstreams, and can add significantly to monthly bandwidth usage allowances.

Why doesn't Twister use merged mining, much like Namecoin does? There is essentially no cost to anyone except the miners' software costs, and you get the computational security of the current bitcoin network.

My point about mining was that you can aid the network with only outbound connections *if* you mine with that node. You probably wont do anything as a solo miner, but *in theory* you're increasing the hash rate of the network, which increases security.
60+ peers connected to you certainly aids the network assuming you run an honest node. Keep in mind that probably amounts to at least ~1GB of transaction traffic per day, so operating a node with this many connections might not be feasible or desirable for some people.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:17:23
That's more or less correct. Keep in mind that first-mover advantage in the world of bitcoin mining is everything. Having that machine *now* would indeed lead to massive profits, but the machine does not exist. Time is money!

@_date: 2013-11-19 16:43:15
Keep in mind you're doing essentially nothing for the network if you cannot accept inbound connections (e.g. you're behind a firewall) and you're not solo mining. Simply running the Bitcoin QT client and connecting to the default 8 outbound peers doesn't really do anything for "the network" at all. In fact, you take up connection slots of the peers you're connecting to, which is a mildly negative thing.
"The more people run full nodes, the more stable and secure the Bitcoin network is." - perhaps *backed up* is the right term, so in that sense the network becomes more redundant. Stability is also not a given.

Since you have enabled inbound connections, yes, people like you can defend the network against bad node behaviour. (Keep in mind the definition of "bad" can be subjective; this is after all a giant "consensus network").
Alternatively, if someone runs a client in the scenario I described with only outbound connections, they act as a leaf in the network. The only transactions they effectively relay are their own, if they generate any new transactions at all. The rest of the traffic is basically one-way - the leaf client will have no new information about the network's transactions. Thus, without inbound connections the leaf node just sits there as a passive observer to the network's activities. It's neither a very positive or very negative thing to do.

This always made sense to me - if you are given a Bitcoin (or dollar, whatever), that's presumably due to some "good" you've done the world. By delaying the settling of the debt others owe to you, you're gifting everyone else the use of your "good", indirectly.

bitcoind uses pretty basic networking - it has a list of peers, and a simple protocol for asking about peers. The network is not "secure" in the traditional sense of being protected from harm; the history of the blockchain is protected, but the network is pretty naked.

Multi-layer PCBs can forgo visible traces on the upper layer. For example the connections could be on the layers sandwiched beneath.

Take a look at [this commit]( from 2 years ago if that link isn't informative.
The client node software needs to be "ok with" the concept of merged mining, that is, the idea of being an auxiliary chain to some other, more powerful main chain. This needs to be explicitly in the verification logic of whatever blockchain is supposed to accept aux-chain POW. It says explicitly in the readme - "Of course, aux POW will be rejected by unpatched clients."
My original question was whether anyone knew if there was a reason, other than laziness, for not supporting aux-chain verification.

Yes, it is possible to put a cap on the number of connections the client will make. The parameter is called "maxconnections" and can be set via the command line or in the configuration file. e.g. in the bitcoin.conf, you can have:
Unfortunately that still doesn't cap the actual traffic, though it does end up being rather proportional to it. This is an often complained about shortfall in the default client. You can cap the bandwidth by other means, the easiest way usually being via your router.

I don't honestly know; it would be case-by-case. You'd have to talk to an engineer who works on BIOS/EFI systems. Putting the tinfoil hat on for a moment, I can imagine very well-written malware may be able to stay in some un-flashed area of memory, or re-insert itself, or something magic like that. Remember that the BIOS is simply another little computer. When you flash the BIOS you're just overwriting some non-volatile memory (NVM, e.g. EEPROM), so depending on the specific motherboard, who knows. BIOS/EFI chips are pretty sophisticated now. Then again the instructions to overwrite the NVM are probably really basic hardware instructions, so to answer your question: ya, probably, but I'm only guessing.
