It's been [going on for some time now](

Up till now the chains share the blocks. Core will continue to mine approx. 1 block per 10 minutes, Cash will mine their own blocks which will take many hours. Mining will be very slow for the first couple days. The first BCC only block can be mined any time from now to tomorrow, statistically I guess around 10 hours, but it's random.

Technically for it to be fork the chains need to start mining different blocks. But as BCC has much lower hasrate it will take many hours to split for good. Now it only lags behind. BTC now continues its own chain which will be unrelated to BCC.

Which should be expected after everyone adviced to keep your coins in private wallet and wait couple days for the dust to settle.

It's a big advantage when you keep those tribes in a friendly competition, they have reason to eveovle and better themselves faster than a single monopoly like group. Despite all wars which has been waged between tribes our human society as a whole is arguably at its peak right now.

That can be fixed when needed.

Now we can thank these dudes that they kept the economy going. If everyone was just hoarding all the BTC we would have still nothing today :)

I decided to buy some BTC when it reached $1. I bought some coins from Slush for about $1.2, bit more elsewhere and mined the rest in 2011. Not a big amount but good enough. Now I more regret spending already 1/3 of what I had before it really went up, but hey, at least I got my investment completely back no matter what happens next.
For laughs try to imagine that one guy spent 10000 BTC for $25 worth of pizza just three years back.

Two years ago it went from $1 to $14 I think, then it went down a bit and stayed there for the whole next year. People were counting how many months it will take to reach $100 back in 2011 and the growth never continued so I wouldn't count on that.

I bought some then but not enough and I already spent 1/3 of that.
