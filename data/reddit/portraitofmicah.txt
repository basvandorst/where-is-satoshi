Well... if anyone knows a scam... it’s a scammer.

Except bitcoin doesn’t do any of those things better than fiat (currently)

Sorry but that’s a load of shit. 
“The only currency you have” 
Sell some for fiat and buy that way.

You own the value that other people agree this “asset” holds. 
Which could be $11,000 
Or $0.00 
That’s all you own. Don’t kid yourself.

I am so not convinced that this is going to keep moving up. 
If anyone would like to prove me wrong - flick me some coin. 
If you are so convinced that it will keep rising, what could it hurt to share some wealth??

Yes, you’re missing that I was talking about managing multiple accounts including; mortgage, savings, investments, household spending, credit card etc. 
I wasn’t comparing crypto to cash, I was comparing it to traditional banking which is why I believe it’s years off from mass adoption. 
In the real world people need to worry about more than just “which shops can I purchase xyz basic commodity with crypto”.

Mate... I’m reasonably tech savvy and even I would not bother with crypto until it becomes easier. 
When you have a home loan, credit card, transaction account etc to manage every week you don’t want to fuck around with hashes and pass keys and all that garbage.

And if you lose it through some scam or theft  (of which there are plenty) then you’re screwed.  Ive had my back account hacked and credit card skimmed and both times the bank took the hit and refunded ALL the loss. I love the idea of crypto, but it’s just not the in the same league as fiat when it comes to safety and ease of use.

Yet another example of why “Mass adoption”  is never gonna happen. 
@_date: 2019-12-09 23:24:47
Same reason it’s failed everywhere else. Normal money is easier and more accessible. 
I’m a reasonably tech competent 36year old in a first world country and even I find bitcoin and crypto more hassle than it’s worth. 
My parents/older relatives? Forget about it! They wouldn’t even know where to start. When &gt; 50% of the population don’t understand how to use a currency it won’t take off.

Same root cause of Bitcoin failing tho.

I’m sorry but this story is a prime example of why bitcoin is NOWHERE near mass adoption. 
If a tech savvy person can fuck up like this, my wife/mother/father/elderly family have got no hope.
