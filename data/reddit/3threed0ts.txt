Your temperatures are pretty normal.
Only way to go lower is colder air in the intake.

Correct...but why can’t Netflix, Apple,Amazon, Google combine some of that huge capital and create their own network.? I’m sure they can afford a couple dozen satellites.

I was thinking the same thing this morning after talking to my bank. I'm also interested

Wordpress should be fine. It has thousands of free plugins, themes etc and it's easy to use. They should have developed a bitcoin plugin..need a bit of research probably!

That's o long discussion but I can think 1-2 reasons of the top of my head.
1. No leaders. If I wanted and/or needed to follow someone there are plenty of more qualified leaders outside the world of crypto currencies.
2. Would hate to see parts of the consensus try to accumulate more power and control.

Same here..I've set up a full node 4 days ago as a way for me to vote. Consensus is the main reason I'm involved with bitcoin. If consensus is broken I'm out.

All of the above. They take control of the code. But it won't happen.

+ the old lady will certainly not going to grow any muscles...maybe just live for a bit longer

What in their mind those SegWit2X people are thinking? If people wanted to follow companies they wouldn't be interested in bitcoin in the first place.

Great move! The more the better

They don't accept bitcoin but I think u can buy an amazon gift card with bitcoin.  In any case Amazon's yearly earnings are as much as bitcoin's current market cap. Totally different league(for now). Let's hope Amazon won't get interested in Bitcoin for a couple more years.

Hashrate does not matter. The value decides which blockchain is Bitcoin. The longer you've existed in a blockchain the harder it is to "switch" to a new one. Most users(the ones who matter the most) will stick to the one they know and trust.
2X is going to be a flop. Not as bad as the "Gold" one. More like the "Cash". It's unnecessary and an obvious move to seize control and power. Those companies are in a hurry to get rich, move to SF and be legit CEOs and play the big game.

That's ok. I'll keep running the bitcoin core node for the fun of it :)

I agree..That chaos of plugins in Wordpress made me switch to Drupal.

It does show to the network which set of rules I approve, doesn't it?

Like your site. You should consider ditching squarespace for an open source platform though. You know, in the context of being in control.

The possibilities are endless

To simply put it, I would be sad to see bitcoin fail just because some people want more power, more money, more control. I support the idea behind bitcoin, but if people destroy it, I'll give up on it.

What if Google started to accept bitcoin for selling ads and users' data?
