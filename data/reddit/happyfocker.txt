Or because he didn't understand it,  not because he couldn't "hold it" 
@_date: 2014-09-28 06:58:32

I wish i was one of the people with tens of thousands of bitcoins.   I would love to give people a nexus 5 to destroy their shitphones. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:23:47
should be "you can get some flowers,  and pay in bitcoin too" 
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:06:38
Yup, that's usually what you hear when people can't admit they're wrong. sorry man

@_date: 2014-07-05 13:53:11
please direct her to the bitcoin max price and tell her to never make decisions for you about things she doesn't understand, ever again. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:17:21
Nice try big banker. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:30:44
No reason? I can think of one; to stay in power. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:17:30
dont fucking do it.   you already missed out on thousands from that $50 sale,  dont be stupid... find another source for your down payment. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:36:34
instead of doing some dumb shit like asking a search engine what the price is, just fucking type preev.com or coinbase.com etc... 
@_date: 2014-09-20 07:30:10
Shut the fuck up. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:50:39
im glad we have the guardian to tell us everything will be ok
@_date: 2014-05-21 02:48:44

@_date: 2014-01-24 21:18:50
look at the charts.   people said it would nevrf hit $1, then $10 then $100, then $1000.  it hit all those.   it will only go higher as more people and business adopt it. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:48:55
interesting. do you have the source link? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 21:04:43
No problem, it's not your fault I can't type.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:21:53
you're a dumb fucking idiot 
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:47:45
fuck that.  tip anyways
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:20:37
then dont fucking sell them... holy fuck
@_date: 2014-05-14 04:15:25
Oh, i recieved "verified"  messages so i figured you accepted them. No problem. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 05:24:22
the real question is why the fuck wasn't the wallet encrypted? or, did the court force the password from him? 
@_date: 2014-05-14 04:07:03
Well, you accepted them so pass them on or send em back, its up to you. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:26:13
this is so awesome.   good for you man! 
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:31:57
Yes.  Practice transfering and  recovering with a small amount of BTC.  Figure out how it works, understand it, only then should you use it.
@_date: 2013-10-10 23:55:44
I just got my money cleared today....can't use it.  
@_date: 2013-10-26 03:04:42
How do you figure that?  What's the math.  I'm clueless with this kind of stuff.
