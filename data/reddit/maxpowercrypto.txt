Hey, very nice!
One feature I would love to see would be some kind of import of the Bittrex/Poloniex/etc. trading history (they allow you to export a .csv file). That way you could just import those files and it would generate the custom URL using that data.
A small sidenote: Sending the amount of coins a person has to a server can still be seen as a security risk. It would be safer to request the current prices from your API and do the calculations in the frontend.
Are you planning on further developing the app or should it stay as simple as it is now?

Tweets like that only create false hope and expectations. As soon as SegWit is activated it is technically possible to have lightning transactions, but that doesn't mean it will happen immediately. We need to wait at least a couple of weeks, maybe even months, for some solid and tested apps to come out that make it possible to use lightning transactions for every day use.

Thank you for your valuable input!

As I said, technically it won't be a problem to enable it right away. But having a system that is close to 100% reliable, as it should be in the case of any crypto currency, is something different.
Just the other day I saw a thread about someone trying it out on the testnet and after he opened his channel, the node he connected to went down or something like that. That's fine if it happens on the testnet, but imagine the shitstorm if that happens to on the mainnet.

I asked a serious question and you just come here to insult me. Instead, why don't you give me a serious explanation why I'm wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:45:47
Thanks for the explanation.
So coming back to my original question, what is the block size that the core team thinks is best in the long run? If they really believe that we should stay on 1MB blocks then it's fine with me. It means we will have high fees for a couple of months now, but once the Lightning Network takes off, it will hopefully decrease or not matter that much anymore. But if they do have plans to increase the block size anyway at a later date, I don't see why we have this huge debate and possibly another fork just because of something "political" (because the wrong people suggested the block size increase).

Did you also use breadwallet to create your mnemonic phrase, or was it another app?
If it was breadwallet, check this list here and see if all your words match (to make sure it's not a simple misspelling): 
Otherwise I would try it with the same app you generated it with because they are sometimes not compatible (they use a different BIP32 Derivation Path)

What do you mean by that exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:55:57
I certainly hope that the LN will solve this problem for the most part, but we just have to wait and see.


So the question is how long it will take for that switch to happen. All I'm saying is that a block size increase would give us some breathing room. Now if the plan is to stay on 1MB forever, then it's worth to just wait and accept the high fees at the moment. But if the plan is to increase the block size at a later date anyway, then why have this debate and risk another fork?
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:08:02
^ Exactly this.

I wouldn't give these articles too much attention. Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow or the day after that. If any big news come out the price could go to $10000 overnight, or it could crash down to $3000. Generally I and most people here still believe that in the long term, the price of Bitcoin will go up...

My moon-math says yes!
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:56:24
Thanks for the clarification, that makes sense.
How long would you wait until you consider the seed secure?
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:09:27
Even though I like the idea, I don't think it's gonna catch on. EVERYBODY would have to switch to mBTC and I just don't see that happening...

It does not cost anything to create a paper wallet. In fact, you can create as many different paper wallets as you want.
The only thing that will cost you money is the transaction itself. This fee is sometimes covered by the exchange, but I don't know how coinbase handles it.
The reason you should transfer your funds to your own wallet is that you don't have full control over your money if you leave it on an exchange. If the exchange goes bankrupt or they lose their funds, then your money will be gone. There was a famous case a couple of years ago where a lot of people lost a lot of money:

I've tried Electrum a couple of weeks ago and it still used 12 words. I used it to see if I was able to recover my Bread Wallet with it. It took quite some time until I found the right Derivation Path. Try to research which wallets were around at the time you created it. Maybe that will give you an idea what you need to enter there.

I'm waiting for a BlackFriday Token (BFT) that somehow lets you get Bitcoin at a discount.

Nice to see you are still working on your project.
I wonder what exactly the advantages of this project are over let's say  Do the video/audio feeds really make that big of a difference?
Also, I can see numbers next to the different entropies. But what do they mean? And how long should I wait until the seed is secure? It would be nice to have some kind of indicator for that.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:33:59
Did you try to install electrum  and create a new wallet with your mnemonic? If you don't remember the original wallet you used then you might need to play around with the settings a little to be able to see your funds. Good luck!

I'm going with NEO
