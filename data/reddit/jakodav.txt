I've actually read parts of it.  
It covers a lot of ground in short phrases, which is a good thing, but it could use more editorial work.
The library itself, [NBitcoin]( seems to be very well thought. I'd like to invest more time into it.

Both of the above, especially when you approach the mid-book chapters.  
Just a random example, found in my first skimming attempt:


Should be "You can generate **a** key.."
Also, the late chapters seem to be a bit rushed-through. They could use a background expansion, for those less familiar with the subject (like me).  
I mean, when presenting a topic like multi-sig, most readers will be interested in understanding the subject itself, I suppose, beyond its NBitcoin manifestation.

You might want to check out NBitcoin, a C# Bitcoin library:

It'll also take care of the excess money.

Backing by IOU will make them FED-equivalent. Give me your USDT to get another in return.      
They're playing a dangerous game calling their token "USDT". Liberty Dollar was targeted for much less.

The FED doesn't funnel all of its printed money to *one channel*. If the FED decided to buy Burritos, and Burritos only, with its newly printed dollars, be sure Burrito's price will skyrocket.

Bittrex trades ~$100m in USDT pairs daily, and ~580m overall. So not "only Tether pairs".   
But even if they traded only USDT, I don't see how it would affect them. USDT holders will lose their money, but others won't be affected. For all purposes USDT holders will still have their tokens, only that they'll be worth nothing.

BTC's been here since 2009. When?

What prevents double-spending, is not the latency per-se, but the *work* that has to be done during that latency.
When the network size increases, you can safely increase the block size, or alternatively reduce the 10-minute window, without sacrificing security; the fraudster miner will have to work equally hard to control the chain.
In other words:
Say that now you have to spend $X to control the chain for an hour.
With a larger network, you'll have to spend $10X to do the same.
Given that, we can allow ourselves to increase the block size (or shorten the time interval), getting it back to $1X, if it allows us increasing Bitcoin's reach.

The pools controlling the mining won't like it, you can bet on that.  
Shorter times means decreased difficulty, which means lower barriers to entry.  
I guess that's why such a change isn't even discussed as an option.

It does imply latency, but the *amount* of latency can be varied, or more specifically, reduced, as the network grows.
10 minutes is just an arbitrary starting point chosen by Satoshi. We have no reason to assume that's the optimal number.

You can perhaps fake a signature, you can't fake a personality. Especially not in a frontal conservation. Especially not with a knowledgeable guy like Gavin.  
Here's [another]( testimony by Gavin.
As typical to conspiracy theories, the arguments get more &amp; more bizarre.  
It's much easier to believe Craig==Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:12:07
It's very unlikely that anyone other than Satoshi mined block 1. Very few people could understand, or would care about bitcoin right after its release.  
Satoshi would literally only need to turn on the software in order to mine another block.

Once you "store your bitcoins" on coinbase, they're no longer "yours".
If you don't control the keys, you don't own bitcoins.

@_date: 2016-05-02 18:44:31
OK, but this argument implicitly makes Gavin part of a conspiracy, which is even a stranger idea than the original Craig==Satoshui claim.

No one even responded to the thread. If Craig is *not* Satoshi, he would have had to be a constant reader of that mailing list, and be such a tech savvy to be interested in downloading and running the node.  
For an ordinary person like Craig, Bitcoin would bare no significance whatsoever at this stage. For an alleged hoax, it would be too early to suggest any financial value.
I doubt the node even ran successfully, without missing dependencies, etc. 
If he's a hoax like many here believe him to be, why would he even encounter that message, yet better, act so quickly? Are we talking about a hoax following all mailing lists, looking for opportunities, or does he have a special keen for cryptography? Makes no sense.
For me, it seems like people are willing to bend logic, in order to make Satoshi what they want him to be, instead of accepting who he *is*.

That statement from Gavin rules out a possibility of duping IMO. Craig wouldn't be able to fake a person Gavin directly corresponded with.   
You would have to either assume Gavin is a complicit, or he's telling the truth.
Edit: Also, if Craig is such a social mastermind, he could as well be a tech mastermind.
