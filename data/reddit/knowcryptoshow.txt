I agree with you on Blocknet! Its team is ever so working hard at advancing the decentralized interoperability protocols.
I think the issue for Blocknet missed mentions is because of the  2017 ICO craze. So many so-called "new" ideas were pushed during this Hype Cycle. Many of the graduates from that era were new adoptions to the blockchain world(new coiners and new devs) So they only know of their graduating peers not realizing the pure foundations were already laid while they were just hearing about  "interoperability" in classes.
Blocknet predates all these "new" ideas by roughly 3 years.
Their project/ideas began earlier but their ITO was Oct - Nov 2014 (before the term ICO) just a couple of months after ETH
Bitcointalk October 20, 2014.
Blocknet only holds to the philosophical purity of decentralization and interoperability with a focus on allowing chains any chain do what they do best and making that best  (metadata/values) be sharable across chains and or bringing that data into any app - such as an exchange but really anything. All this without creating another walled society or chain to store or prove data that is already proved or stored.
Here is a fairly recent video with Arlyn on Blocknet
All there API's are available to use and build upon! for anyone!
