If there is a server with CP TIFF images on it, but the person who posesses that server is not in posession of an TIFF image viewer to translate those encoded file into an actual image, is that person in posession of CP?

The website describes how their method works, so theoretically you could write your own program to write messages that can be read by the site. However, I do not consider that relevant to the discussion at hand, I just wanted to mention that.
The important difference here is that the Blockchain can be crawled for this data within a reasonable timeframe, while looking for images in PI is not feasible due to how unlikely it is for a sequence in PI to even be a discernable image.
So once an image has been added to the blockchain, people can access it within a reasonable timeframe using the crawler, while you need the positional number to find pretty much any image in pi within your lifetime.
Due to that, I argue that the positional number is the encoded image, not pi itself, which is why I disagree with the comparison made by OP.
To summarize what I mean:
* Blockchain + Reader + A little time =&gt; You can access all images added
* Pi + Reader + A little time =&gt; You most likely don't even find any image
* Pi + positional number + Reader + A little time =&gt; You immediately access an image

Well. The file is on your computer. As soon as that becomes public knowledge, you are knowingly in posession of CP.

The method used by that website doesn't require any external knowledge, just the blockchain, as the way they encode data preserves the correct order and is inherently designed to signal the beginning and end of a message.
Their help subpage explains the method.

[There is a new paper from this month that explains how to hide large amounts of data in a way that is easy to piece together.](
The paper also analyzes what kinds of data are being stored already as well as what problematic data there already is.

By using a specific algorithm, you can extract a very limited amount of data out of a very limited set of literature.
By using the method used by the website, you can read and write arbitrary data from and to the blockchain without changing your algorithm.
See where I see the difference?
Also, by using your argument we can say that literature doesn't mean anything as you need to know what language it is in. That might be philosophically interesting, but not useful in praxis.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:59:05
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

So by your reasoning I can distribute CP as long as I never open a viewer to look at the images?

The paper details why, at least in Germany, such an interpretation of the law is actually likely (though not guaranteed as there is no precedence).
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:15:23
The difference here is that "the internet" is an amorphous network of connections between computers, some of which host CP, while "the blockchain" is an actual file/a series of files which contain (encoded) CP.

Ackchyually, the new papaer is [this one.](
It outlines various ways to insert data into the blockchain *besides* OP_RETURN, as well as an overview about how these methods have already been used.


In an online forum this image is claimed to show child pornography, albeit this
claim cannot be verified (due to ethical concerns we refrain from providing a citation).
-Chapter 4.3 of the paper above
Sure, that does not prove that there is actual CP in the blockchain. However *the possibility is there*. And as soon as someone does that, the blockchain becomes illegal in at least Germany, but potentially in most of the world depending on the exact laws.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:19:23
The difference that in the blockchain, that data is persistent by design. You'd have to alter the chain to remove it, but being unable to alter the chain is one of, if not the primary selling point of blockchains.

It's not OP codes though. Read the paper.

It's not that complicated to extract messages from the blockchain.
[This website]( does it on the fly.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:46:15
The Blockchain can hold arbitrary data, encoded so that a programm can find the data without any outside information. [In fact, there already is a site that does that for you](
To read useful information out of pi, you need to specify *where to search* in addition to having a program that reads pi as data. Also, most usable images are too large to find in pi in a acceptable amount of time, while writing to the blockchain takes as long as a transaction takes.

I know Shrödingers cat, but I don't see how that applies here. Because they didn't confirm whether it was CP?

If the amount of wares also doubles, it doesn't.

That is true, but does not address my initial objection that monetary supply inflation does not matter to consumers and that price inflation does. You seem to agree to the latter, given that you care about the development of prices, so I'd like to hear why the money supply inflation matters to consumers.
Or, if it does not matter to consumers, why I should care.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:50:16
How, though? What I can buy with a certain amount of money (*what it is worth*) does only depend on the price of goods, does it not?
Increase in price are measured as price inflation, (somewhat) independend of monetary supply inflation. The only connection is that monetary inflation is in part responsible for price inflation.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:41:39
Being lied to about the price inflation does not mean that I should care about the monetary inflation instead of the price inflation. Rather, it means that I should try to find out what the actual price inflation is.
Also, the government spending money generated by monetary supply inflation to spy on me does not mean that I should care about it. It merely means that I should care about how the government uses its money. If all that money went to schools instead, I'd be *happy* about that monetary supply inflation, as long as it does not significantly devalue my money.
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:07:02
Why does inflation of the money supply matter if my wage stays the same and the amount of goods I can buy for that money shrinks by the price inflation, which is much less than your 10% monetary inflation?

Prices drop all the time despite inflation. Just look at the price of computer technology over time, compared to its power.
