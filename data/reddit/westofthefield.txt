Thanks.  For tax year 2017/2018? 
How could it be January 2018 when there would still be 4 months of the tax year left.  I will have to get it done quick if I have to do it by this month.
Edit:  Sorry, I noticed I wrote 2016/17 in my post.  I meant 2017/18.

When do the tax returns have to be filed by for the 2016/2017 tax year. I know the tax year ends in April.

I can third this recommendation OP.  I suffer the same condition as these 2 posters and they speak the truth of what it is like.  I love bitcoin too, and I commend you for all the charity work you are doing with your bitcoins.  Cheers to OP and my fellow ME/CFS bitcoiners.

Something like this might just convince me to start wearing a watch again.

Yes, but it would definitly be more marketable if you could get it to work without having to take the back off.  It looks great though.

Yes, link to a source on this please?  We have to pay capital gains tax don't we?

He's saying they don't spend their money on women, they spend it on bitcoin.

does Mycelium work with importing a BIP38 protected paper wallet?

Thanks for the information.  So shall I just withdraw to my existing bank account then?  Worst case-scenario would be they close my account and issue me a cheque for the balance - and I just open up a new bank account with another bank and put the cheque in it.  I don't really mind doing that as I think I will be selling all my bitcoin for good.  Or is there an even worse case?

Ah I see, a new bank would likely not want to give me an account if I am putting cash I just got from selling bitcoin into it.  Fidor might accept it though possibly.  Wow, it's difficult isn't it.  Thanks for your help, I will take a look into the EUR account idea.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:03:27
Is it not possible to get fiat to Fidor from Bitstamp either then?  On Bitstamp you can sell bitcoin for Euros or US dollars.  
I was signing up for Fidor as lots of people here say it is bitcoin friendly.  Why does it not support incoming SEPA or IBAN?  Any idea which bank I could use instead? I'm in the UK.

Will they give you a chance to transfer it to a new bank, or give you a cheque?  Will any other bank accept your money do you think?  I'm worried the same will happen to me when I sell (also in UK).
