@_date: 2017-04-10 11:11:07

@_date: 2017-10-05 05:03:14
I see. that's kind of annoying. Thanks!

Status changed to denied. Resent the coins and it went through immediately to receiver, the second time. though status does still say pending. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 22:36:06
I'm being told it has not come through yet. I still have the funds in my account as well. Are you sure?

No big deal, how long on average will I be waiting? What's the longest? As long as it's hours and not days.

Can you tell me exactly what you do? If i click on credit card on the left hand side and try to purchase one of the pre-set amounts say $250 USD the screen reloads but nothing happens. If i go to account and click on debit card on the left hand side it says

Maybe I need to activate two factor authentication? It's in big red letters at the top of that page. I've tried but it sends a code to a phone that you need to input but I have no idea if they have my phone or not and i can't find a page to update that information.

I'm verified. No service in the US it seems?
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:18:00
Now it's working now that I have Google authentication set up. Is there a way to select a custom amount of bitcoin/USD to spend or can you just use the pre-set amounts? 
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:46:44
When I go to the debit card tab it says 


@_date: 2017-07-12 21:12:59
So i set up google authenticator for my google account but i'm not sure how to link it to bitstamp. Is there a way to see what email you used on sign up? There doesn't seem to be any account settings like name, phone number, birthdate, email etc.
Edit: nevermind figured it out. Had to input the authentication key they gave first, duh. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:45:36
Right yes, then i hit credit card on the left hand side and try to buy the pre-set amount of USD/btc's and nothing happens.

I said bro coinbase isn't available to me. They banned me. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:04:01
Thanks bro. Appreciate the help
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:34:33
Yeah. I'm saying I can't do a wire transfer with US money when I need to buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:07:32
Is there a limit for new users how much they can buy using a credit card? 
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:21:29
Paying with bitcoin gives me a 20% discount. I just signed up for bitstamp and am waiting for the verification process to go through.

Mycelium denied my first bitcoin purchase of $260 using a debit card. I need another app. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:56:18
There does not seem to be a way to purchase bitcoins with Breadwallet using my android phone.
