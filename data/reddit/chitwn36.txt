He’s the boss? Last thing I do is send my direct reports to investigate something that may affect the company �� He is lazy, learn as much as you can, don’t tell him shit and when shit goes south his head is on the block and oh well what do you know....you know a lot about this, how would you like a new position? �� No Love

It’s funny now that there are so many people running around yelling crash crash crash.  A crash for me is if it dips below 400 ��.    You can tell how long someone has been in it.  I tell people to HODL

Very true, I could show you all the text of screenshots when BTC was 900 to my friends.  They wish they listened

Thanks for sharing.  I researched bitcoin back in 2014 for like 3 months before I bought some. I bought in at $400 and wished I got in sooner. He’s right....there’s those who don’t even know what it is, people who are looking in from outside and those who took the time to study, knew it was worth the risk and went in. I’m glad a buddy of mine bought a .25 of one after over a year of me explaining it to him ,this past week.

Took me four days.  I contacted Trezor and told them and hours later it was confirmed

I’ll hodl, but I’m curious to know what makes you so confident. I got in at 400 so I’ve been here before but please raise my spirits ��

Hope so, that way I can buy the dip....ease your nerves and just do this.   HODL.

I would say buy one, and that's it. Don't mess with that college money
