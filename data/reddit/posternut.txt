Bitcoin was created by Cypherpunks not Wall Street. Let's try and remember that from time to time. Nothing wrong with that.

This is my article on this subject.

Good morning  it's another Friday and you know what that means...a fresh and new  interview with your favorite movers and shakers in the  community! Today I'm proud to announce the fourth installment to the CB series with  evangelist and self proclaimed Voluntarist Roger Ver. Roger is a huge contributing community member to our universe. He's helped others with a ton of Bitcoin startups and new ventures. He speaks often and fluently to many groups and conferences on Bitcoin and how it will change our world. We discuss a bunch of things in this Q&amp;A regarding bitcoin, it's speculation, the  fiasco in Oct., his brand new Bounty Hunter site,   and more. 
      So grab a cup of coffee, sit back and take a read with the latest CryptoBits with Roger. Look out for next weeks CB interview as I have a candid conversation with the man behind the Dollar Vigilante and Anarchast Jeff Berwick. 
     Many more CryptoBits to come so Stay Tuned to the NotBeingGoverned.com blog The blogsters who put the Art in  :D
   "The state is simply a small group of people, violently imposing their will upon the rest of us.  They predominantly maintain their control by controlling money.  Bitcoin will separate the control of money from the state." ~ Roger Ver

Great work Julia. Keep up the good work.

Gorgeous my friend. Looks awesome.

I love bitcoin but you don't tell your kids about it???? Teaching children the origins of money like gold, fiat and crypto is what's going to stop global financial corruption. I'm sorry you feel it's "indoctrination" I call it economics.

The team will be based all across the globe. The founders are just creators of the idea being formed. Enjoy! A new form of advertising is coming!

Tired of these down voters lately. This is good work. Good luck bro.

Censorship is a deplorable action within online communities. 
Keep telling the TRUTH! 
@_date: 2015-09-08 13:44:31
I appreciate the feedback. But I think the discussion is still happening. There are back links in my article to recent reddit posts on the subject. Also I do think it's "Do Whatever" at this moment in time. As there is a majority of people who dig the Unicode but we have not yet come to consensus on this matter as many illustration, typography do "whatever they want" ATM. As a graphic artist myself I do what I like at the moment. What I think is fitting. 
That's the beauty of Bitcoin. :)

Unfortunately we don't lie. It is decentralized and should be noted otherwise they obviously look to the "traditional" finance system of today which if it's a credit card charges people to to cover rolled back fiat from theft.

Just a mere "nuisance"

Yes this is rumored.

End the state. Point blank.

It's a direct post to the timeline. You have to have your FB account linked. Once logged in you can type your friends name. Some people due to privacy settings cannot be tipped. Also there's a bug for notifications. The person who was tipped will not receive a notification sometimes even in the commentary. I've found tagging in the comments helpful but they should fix that. It's annoying.

What is the function of police; what do they provide and more importantly why is there no competition for their services? Also why is it I'm forced to pay for services which rarely meet anyone's expectations. Most people are frightened to get pulled over. Most people get extorted everyday from bad blinkers to going 10mph over a speed limit. Then there is the deaths of countless individuals who did nothing criminal and paid the price by this violent monopoly and most (not all) get away with it. 
They rarely prevent crime; they arrive after the damage is done.   The greater concern should be the prevention of crime.  The best crime prevention is a strong community.  Solidarity with one's neighbors provides an increase in security and safety for all.  The Amish and the historical record of the Native Americans illustrate how culture and community make a really big difference. This is just one out of the box idea that is actually tried and tested. 
Police act as "first responders", much like firemen.  To fill this role, the people of the community would need to take steps to train everyone to act as a first responder able to deal with a wide variety of circumstances from car crashes to heart attacks.  This training would also need to address how authority can be asserted, and people can be organized in the event of an emergency. So for your question to outsiders it would be the same. This is nearly identical to how a militia would form in a community to protect itself from an external threat. Then there is private police and dispute resolution services which are arbitrarily guided by the market itself. Aka the customers. 
Here is reading on the subject as well as audio. Ideas that can out perform and outshine the idea of Justice being backed by force and violence. The free market is the answer. Laissez Faire is the only fair. 
For a New Liberty by Murray Rothbard please read the "Public Sector" section regarding dispute resolution services, private police and courts and law. 
You can also listen to it here on YouTube

The power vacuum is a constant false dichotomy. The situation is not either answer A or answer B. The excuse of yet another rival gang can just take over has been said for millennia. What is the difference between what we have now as militia and police? No one watches the watchmen. They are clearly two of the most powerful gangs with a ton of overreach. What makes them different than the Soprano boys? They all make money through violence and extortion. The free market provides choice and competitors. Where is this choice now when it comes to policing, militia or self governence? It's non existent.
     The days of just because you were born in a geographical location means consent is getting old. People are tired of it. Good ideas don't require force. 
Decentralize All Things.

It is happening right now. The building of CryptoCurrency and distributed marketplaces are being built as we speak. Mesh networks are becoming stronger and more solidified. Offline communication is being worked on even the blockchain being run on a standard shortwave HAM radio. A small fraction of people 'currently' are participating which most are open to the decentralization of all things, open source all things, peer to peer all things. This my friend is happening and aggregating an accumulation of people who want to emulate 'good and fair' practices. Over time there will be 5 more crypto kids going against the 10 paid NSA employees. Over time the fraction will become more prevalent and significant. 
     Already the Liberty Movement and the Occupiers have made people aware of the injustices of government, authority and unwanted third party arbitration. The trigger was pulled twenty years ago by May, Hughes and others by circumstances of utter corruption, spying and theft. 
     As far as your participation of being a node or part of the mesh it's merely spontaneous order. It will happen as little and as much as you want to partake in it. Our lives are tandem with technology and most want to participate in a more peaceful non aggressive society and will most likely use tools given to them if they work. Incentive based like bitcoin saving people money transferring wealth and saving people's privacy from third party intrusion. People will join in this environment as they already are. As you are. 
     To say as one commenter wrote " I'm all about decentralization" but disagrees when it comes to governance is absurd and contradictory. Decentralize ALL THINGS. Open Source Everything and Peer to Peer this world for a better tomorrow. 
      This isn't a fantasy it's a reality coming to life welcome to the genesis period.

"Things like TOR, I2P, Bitcoin, Bittorrent, the Pirate Bay, online data houses, the Silk Road, Open Bazaar, Defense Distributed, 3D printing, mesh networking, encrypted chat and messenger services, so many ideas are spontaneously rising. These are the subliminal messages of anarchy dropped into the eyes of society. The idea is the very root of Agorism to create a wonderful Counter-Economy and completely Vacate the State. Now the information era is upon us. "

It's a joke about the halving mixed in with some Kit Kat humor. Not to be taken as a serious statement. :)
