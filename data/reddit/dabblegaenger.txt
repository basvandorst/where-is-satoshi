In Egypt you are actually not required to officially register afaik. Cairo probably has about ~30 million inhabitants but nobody actually knows.

True, I forget that it capsulates my network. I will leave the tower with the btc node running continuously and have my laptop with electrum also use the core protocol, where I store my coins. Thanks for the advice and help :)

I only have a mediocre i7 and AMD 7850 2Gb Computer and I run Bitcoin core full node, but I am not Mining. This cannot make a difference as far as I can see. I would rather spend my hashrate on monero pools than btc, I have no chance on making a difference with my hardware

Unlimited is by far the most stupid and destructive idea since cryptos existed. They should just make their own blockchain if they think they can succeed with the principle of altering every aspect that made BTC what it is

No, actually we are talking about cash and not stocks.
Cash is made to be spent. Nobody could foresee the price at the time.

Okay, that makes it easier for me. I will equip my 3 computers with a core node. Is the core from Bitcoin.org enough to support or do I need anything special for that matter?

Which white paper may I ask?

Once there are more places where you can buy and sell things with it, the price should normalize. Talking about a few years here

this is a perfect summary for "never buy in for more than you can afford to lose"

I am planning on using core even if there will be a hard fork. I am not planning on selling on Bitcoin unlimited
