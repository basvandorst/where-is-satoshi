But it’s not anti-inflationary yet. It literally is inflating daily due to mining rewards. ;-)

If it’s a larger amount. Coinbase Pro is the best way for lowest fees I have found.

I created my own Pi node back in January. Since creation I have literally done nothing with it. Zero upkeep has been required.
Feel free to connect if you like! 
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:42:28
I think I may have bought it from you.

You can also find your node on 1ml.com which is a super cool visual representation of the network and your node on it. It’s cool to watch it grow.

Give us a hint on how happy (without divulging anything too detailed)!

Is there software or something like this available? Anyone know?
I am trying to pitch the idea for my charity. But it can’t be expensive and super difficult or they obviously won’t go for it.

Is “copy pasta” an internet term I am just now hearing? Or an autocorrect success? Because it’s fantastic.

Hmm... I’m not sure what that error means? Anyone else here know? 
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:04:11
They took that part down. It’s not there anymore. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:37:55
Holy cow. Enjoy folks. I’ll get some popcorn!

As someone who is never actually going to try to solve this because my own children stump me with knock knock jokes. 
ELI5 how this is even a puzzle? It’s a picture with dots.

I was reading about cash app last night, is it really few free to make a purchase of BTC?
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:35:48
Well you can buy with a card straight from binance as well. Last time I checked it was basically the same price to buy from binance than to do coinbase and transfer to binance. 
If you do with a credit card on binance you also have to pay a cash advance fee though.

Check out the link in his post for the Stadicus Guide. It will explain it all in great detail. It’s a fully functioning Lightning Network Node. If you don’t have lightning network experience yet, start reading. It is pretty amazing.

Connect to me! I also followed Stadicus guide and I have been learning by the seat of my pants for about a week now up and running!

Yeah I have a comprehension of mining. I am new to nodes and this build is really intriguing to me. I’m just trying to get a better idea of the big picture and how it works. I want to setup a node that is being used to verify transactions and helping the network. 
If I make one, do I hook it up similar to a miner, in that once it’s active it seeks out and verifies its own transactions? Or making this raspberry build here is only for me to have a node for my own personal transactions?
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:46:33
Where is this statistic from? I would like to lookup my own node on it! 
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:52:05
Suggestions can be made on this page. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:33:51
I have another question about this node. From a total node newbie. Making one like this, is it any less useful to the network? Or is a “node a node” so to speak? If I built one with a more powerful computer somehow would that be able to handle more transactions or something. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:40:29
Try connecting as a peer first then creating the channel. That seems to be an issue? 
It’s online. Running fine from what I can see.
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:04:34
I’m wondering why your hard drive is getting so warm. Are you under or perhaps overpowering it? It seems strange to me that it is getting so warm. Just a little concerning for something you’re going to run 24/7/365.
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:21:55
I just finished making my own node today via the raspberry pi build. Spent under $100 bucks on it. 
Thanks Stadicus for the writeup! 
Look up the Raspiblitz.
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:56:07
Great! Solid work! 
Are you running autopilot or connecting only manually? 
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:22:15
Not today NSA!
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:11:47
How exactly are you powering this whole setup? And the hard drive specifically? 
If that’s an internal hard drive for a PC it likely runs off data power usually from then PSU? 
Also how are you powering the fan and pi? Is everything connected to same power supply (ie usb wall outlet? Whats your rated?)
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:03:14
Yes coinbase is a good place to start. Then start reading and asking questions and finding folks to learn from for more detailed info.
@_date: 2019-05-04 19:10:47
This is awesome.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:32:59
What kind of internet bandwidth does this consume? Any affect on other devices? 
Sorry for probably silly newb question. I’m currently into mining never considered a node but this guide has me thinking I have a new tinkering project to try...

Correlation, not causation.
