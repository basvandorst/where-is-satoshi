I started to play with bitcoins in ca 2013 but forgot about them.  
Then sometimes in between i looked into it again but sadly didnt buy more.
About a year ago my mom asked me about bitcoins because her estate agent (some very old guy) told her about it but he was in some scammy investement group and wanted to get my mom into it too...
Then i educated both of them about bitcoin and everything else and so my mom bought some bitcoins a few month before the ATH but she refused to sell at the ATH although she would have more than multiplied her investement :x (yeah shes using it as an investement but i'd like to use it as a payment system)

the estate agent didn't knew that group was a scam he he got scammed and he thought he would help my mother... so he had no malicious intent!  
I even helped him to buy Bitcoins!

yeah, thats why i didn't even try to verify because i dont want them on some exchange, why couldn't i just sign a message with the adress?!

There is already a website with a forum like that i think it used some read only apis to the most used exchanges to verify how much you have! (i didnt even try it just browsed through the open threads)  
I was browsing there but sadly can't remember the name of the site!
