Lol yes, even though it may not be optimal, I live in a 3rd world country, so electricity costs are super low

Thanks. Would you be able to have an answer to the question of not being able to log into any pools because of GUIMner, as the original stated problem in the post?

Well that's some tough news, please do recommend something sir. Bitcoin has gotten crazy in the past 4 years.

OK so this was at around $400M when I first posted in the thread, 13 minutes later, it has jumped to $600M?

Theoretically, if an entity were to take up this "51% attack" ... what would be the consequences?
