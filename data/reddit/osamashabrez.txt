Which mobile wallet you are talking about? You should be able to send a transaction for less than 0.01

You can not move your € from one account to another. The only way you can make profit is if you enough balance on another exchange and simply liquidate on gdax while buying on the other.
Later withdraw your Euros from gdax to your bank account. Easy profits...

Stop orders do not appear in the order book until the stop limit has been hit, not affecting demand price as you can not see them before their execution.
No, unless you are sure you know what you are doing and understand the risks of trade. Imagine you set stop limit of 14000€ and go away, dump causes the price to fell down below 14000€ but it rebounds back to 14500€ in an instance (lots of factors involved)
Now your coins are gone and price has already spiked causing you a net loss.
Not saying they are bad but for an average joe hodling is the way to go!

The wall was created every day three days (3,000 btc @ 1725) in a row, I saw it going down twice myself.
1000 btc = $17,250,000
3000 btc = $51,750,000
$51.75 million is quite a lot of money to eat.

I can only guess he had an idea how long it was? if there were any numbers or special characters. Knowing all these details makes it pretty easy to generate a dictionary.

Looks like someone is pumping the market... spread goes as high as 250€
Does not appear normal to me.

That was not a bug. BTC exchanges work independently of each other. $ &amp; € coinbase exchanges are independent.
Demand &gt; Supply caused those spikes and it was all very real, although I am also not sure what caused it.

So I have installed mycelium on my android device. Set up a seed phrase, created a pin code and now I am transferring my coins to my new wallet address.
Is this enough and will I be able to get my bitcoin gold after fork? thanks for your help.

OK im a naive and I do not want to take complete risk by moving my coins to ~~Trevor~~ trezor or paper wallet.
Is keeping coins on websites like coinbase is the same as keeping them on exchanges? 
Edit: Fixed a typo.
