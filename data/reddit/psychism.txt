Yep, convenience will always win it seems. And that's okay. I'm just glad there is an option now!
Everybody is free to leave the trust-based system whenever they want. The mere fact that a plattform like Bisq exists might have a positive influence on some of the centralized marketplaces. Because if they mess up, all of the reasonable people will be gone.

Yeah that's what I meant. Sorry, not a native speaker.

Both parties are required to provide a [security deposit]( which gets locked into a multisig escrow. If there is a dispute during the wire transfer an [arbitrator]( can look over evidence given by the traders and side with one of them, unlocking the funds.

But there is an escrow in place... To scam people you'd have to collude with an arbitrator (which gets chosen randomly) but that is [accounted for]( also. So there is *some* trust involved but it's basically zero if you're not trading huge sums. That is exactly why this tech is so great.

It is verifiable. They are stating that arbitrators only take digitally signed bank statements as evidence submitted over PGP. A simple screenshot won't do. Obviously I'm just learning about this as well, apparently you have to provide a lot of BSQ as collateral to be an arbitrator, so you have an incentive to keep the network healthy.


You can just not use those payment methods. I'm from Europe, it's not easy to reverse transactions with SEPA, you would have to explain to your account manager how you are wanting to rip people of on the Tor network.


Yes but you can trade as often as you want. Maybe you can automate that and make large trades that way? I don't know.
There will always be some amount of trust involved when dealing with banks. But that is the problem of the fiat system, as you have already stated. I think they have done a good job of minimizing the risk. I certainly don't know of a system that requires less trust.

I was trading Euro for BTC over SEPA wire transfer, there were about 15 or so sell offers at a time.

Yes, the two trading partners will see each other's banking information. There is also quite some risk involved for frequent sellers because your bank might start asking questions when they see a lot of money coming in from random people.
EDIT: but just to be clear; you are not transfering any money to Bisq at any point. There is no (financial) entity like that. It's just code. You are only sending money to the buyer/seller directly.
