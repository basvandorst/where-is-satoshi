He just did an Iama of sorts in another thread answering some of this stuff.  It's still in beta pretty much, there will be a faq coming.

Walk away
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:46:36
yikes, thanks.  I guess I'll email bitinstant.

@_date: 2013-04-13 15:09:15
I don't want mine known.  Isn't that the point?
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:03:41
It was an alt
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:22:05
What time is that EST?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:44:15
Your past seems trolly
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:40:28
Did the form look like it does know, where it specifically asks for the M.........X number?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:27:23
I was confused, mtgox said to give my "exchange" number, but bitinstant asked my account number (m.............x).  Which is correct?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:06:50
It's an auction.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:59:16
Well it would depend on their worth in 4 days.  It's a fool's errand to bid right now anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:07:53
bitinstant through a local moneygram.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:35:52
in this moment I am euphoric
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:37:47
Thanks.  I'm just going to mess around with $100 for now and see what I can do with it.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:38:15
Oh, that's much better.  I copy/pasted the 200Y symbol into google and it brought up a Yuan converter.  Thanks.

@_date: 2013-04-12 18:34:26
Too volatile atm
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:22:53
Maybe you shouldn't be trading if you don't understand the very basic fundamentals.  
Nice name btw
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:18:47
Shut up you entitled child.  Is anyone forcing you to trade there?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:43:16
I WON'T FORGET YOU
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:15:51
You need to go to a local cvs or something and do it by cash.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:38:58
Speculation is just that.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:26:31
It isn't closed.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:15:16
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:14:04
It isn't fucking up to you... 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:30:31
Exchanges.  The largest being mtgox.com
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:50:41
Be patient
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:15:33
You are a gentleman

@_date: 2013-04-11 20:43:49
We need more like Matt, less like you.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:42:58
so so brave
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:40:51
The Bitinstant/CVS route entails you going to cvs and sending a moneygram to bitinstant, which then sends your funds to mtgox.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:40:54
Sounds like 100% of the failure was with your thinking.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:24:43
$100 is what I allow myself for frivolous spending every week so I do consider it burnt.  I just want to jump in at the lowest point today!
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:58:01
Couldn't I set up buy and sell orderss though?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:29:25
Thank you.  I want to go down to CVS to pay but was worried my money would vanish into thin air.

Worked for me earlier
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:47:55
Oh the irony
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:35:38
The one that mt.gox supplied was not accepted by bitinstant.  It said it must be in form m..........x
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:10:10
Guy had a great idea and the markup is substantial, he's gotta be rolling in coins by now.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:31:33
Dude I feel bad for uncircumcised dudes, chicks don't wanna suck that
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:48:07
Where do you see $50?
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:53:21
.00001 of the population know of bitcoin as of yet.  Even less take it seriously.  It isn't even a threat yet.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:53:09
Very nice
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:33:56
Is it cash only or did they take debit for you?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:40:05
Do not listen to this man
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:30:19
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:39:23
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:44:04
after fees that'll leave you with like $19
which will buy you less than 1/20th of a bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:41:58
o u
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:33:50
