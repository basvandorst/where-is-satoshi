Delete all of your bitcoin apps/price tickers and unsub from all of these subreddits. Out of sight, out of mind. Spend time with your friends and family, play a video game, exercise.

Bitcoin is going through adoption and price discovery, so it is difficult to fundamentally value right now. As it becomes more accepted as a medium of exchange, price will begin to stabilize. By then, you may not need to convert back to fiat because there will likely be plenty of vendors accepting Bitcoin for their services, in all walks of life. People who argue that Bitcoin will fail if it's not used as cash right now are morons. They don't understand basic supply/demand.

Should have just listened to your intuition and saved yourself the trouble. There is literally decades and decades of statistical research that has already proven this.

It's a dance. Just like any other TV show, there is a script that they follow. It's a way to create discussion, with the illusion of disagreement, for the sake of entertainment and "education" (to an extent).

"Gay" or not, sports are a huge part of just about every culture in the world. A lot of young people associate sports with stupid because they see a bunch of stupid jocks playing sports at a young age. Fortunately, as you mature, you'll realize that sports are big business, and there are many highly intelligent people involved in sports. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you'll realize that having this mindset of "sports are gay" will only have the result of closing off opportunities to you in the future, whether that be through business opportunities or personal relationships, or both. Grow up.

Bitcoin's disinflationary model protects people from losing purchasing power over time if they are holding it. It doesn't protect people or institutions from collateralizing bitcoin and taking/making bad loans. People and institutions will still lose money from these practices. However, if you are diligent and responsible with your money (and are just holding it), you won't be punished for it like you are today when the Fed prints money for QE, etc. This is especially important for lower income people who generally hold their money in cash because they don't have the means to invest in capital markets and/or leverage with loans etc.

You're right to not trust them. They baited people with the 10 BTC maximum, got their deposits, and then immediately changed that maximum to 5 BTC. They got their deposits and decided they didn't want to pay out on them. That's shady as fuck.

No, he's right. This is a dumb question which you, and everyone else, already know the answer to. Of course no one really knows what the future price is going to be. That's literally predicting the future, which, afaik, is impossible.

If you're looking for the lowest fees but "reputable" it's [Binance]( or Kraken.

You wasted a lot of time to type out your opinions, which are just as speculative as any opinion that BTC is going to $1 million. Just another way to massage your ego and validate yourself. Fortunately, your opinion is completely contrary to the disinflationary properties of a valuable asset, and the properties of supply/demand.

This is an easy one. Somewhere in the $80k-200k range in \~24 months.

Network effect and invested capital are two reasons why it's *highly unlikely* (obviously not impossible) that Bitcoin will be replaced. The Bitcoin protocol already achieves it's purpose perfectly as a hard digital money (decentralization, non-censorable, disinflationary, low-friction, private), so nothing can really improve on it at the moment. Since it serves its purpose exactly as it should, there is no reason/incentive for anyone to switch to a different protocol. There are too many people and too much money (CapEx) invested into the protocol already.
Edit: Also, you basically made u/inthemiks33's point yourself. Technology and infrastructure around Bitcoin will continue to improve, making access much easier, just like what happened with the internet. It's not like those things are static. Once the infrastructure improves, on-ramps will become much simpler and more prevalent. Those things are only months/years away.

This doesn't artificially increase the supply of Bitcoin. It enhances the liquidity. Anyone trying to spend Bitcoin will still have to send a Bitcoin transaction on the blockchain. People don't spend their ETF shares, they have to liquidate their shares and spend the money once the sale of the ETF settles.

You can't arbitrarily choose some short-term time period and declare that Bitcoin isn't doing what it's purported to do. Global issues play out over DECADES and CENTURIES, not over months or even years. Everything that happened in 2008, and in present day can be directly traced back to World War I and decisions that were made over 100 years ago. If you want to go even further back, many global monetary issues are still being molded by the decisions that England/Portugal/Spain made when they divided up the world in the 16th century. I suggest you read up on history before deciding that the events that have occurred during your short time on this earth are sufficient to explain what's happening in the world right now.

Thanks. You were correct. Your response encouraged me to try to recover the wallet one more time. I realized that I probably did not use a 25th seed word (instead of the one I thought I used), and it looks like now my old transactions are showing up during the initial recovery sync. Thanks for the push.

What does "unfulfilled potential" mean? Bitcoin is already realizing 100% of it's potential. It's doing exactly what it's supposed to be doing, which is to be a hard money. There is no other use case. It's the rest of the world that needs to catch up.
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:23:30
Probably because you don't really understand what an ETF is for. ETFs will provide access to a huge portion of retail investors and institutional accounts, such as your 401k/403b/457/pension. This is what people mean by "institutional money". Think about how many more people will have the option of investing in Bitcoin (and thus learning about it over time) if they can choose a Bitcoin ETF in their Fidelity 401k.

All these comments saying "it's stupid" or "it doesn't help" to ask businesses to accept Bitcoin are trying to sound intellectual or making an argument for argument's sake. It's not stupid and it might help create awareness. If one person "hears" about Bitcoin, that could lead to three more people "hearing" about Bitcoin, and then 10 more people, and so on and so forth. This is how adoption gains momentum. Stop trying to discourage OP from discussing Bitcoin with people, even if it's some "low level grunt". At least he's doing something.

Is there any way to get them to do that?? It's been like 8 months. I just posted to their gitter forum, hopefully that helps.
@_date: 2019-09-24 05:14:26
Interesting. Then I have no clue how that transaction (2 inputs going into the 3ERn76 address) could have occurred. Could that address be the address that the funds sit in for the open payment channel? Do you think its possible that Acinq hasn't force-closed the channel after nearly 12 months?

I spoke too soon. I was able to recover my old wallet on Eclair, which now shows my previous transactions. However, the wallet is still empty. I noticed that your response says "assuming  you have restored the same wallet that you had written down from the **Eclair instance** in which you had opened the channel." 
What do you mean by "Eclair instance"? Are you referring to the Eclair app version? I recall specifically that part of the reason I deleted the app was because there was a newer version of the app which was released (and I did not close the LN channel before deleting the old version and installing the new one), so in that sense I don't think I restored the wallet from the same Eclair instance that you are referring to. Is this what you meant by "instance"? 
Currently my wallet activity shows that the .0049 BTC that *was* in the open payment channel is now sitting in this address:
 [ 
I'm not sure how the funds got into this address, and they obviously haven't been moved since they were transferred there on 10/4/2018. If Eclair force-closed the open payment channel, I assume the funds wouldn't just automatically drop into a new BTC address, but that appears to be what happened? I'm super confused.

I believe an earlier comment to this thread, by u/ghost43 indicates that even with the seed phrase and recovered wallet, it's not this simple. It seems he is referring to Acinq/Eclair's use of Google Drive for backing up commitment points. Since I deleted the app without any backups locally or to Google Drive (I disabled the automatic backup feature as soon as I installed the app back in 2018 without realizing what I had done), it seems that my funds were likely lost when Acinq force-closed the channel. This article seems to describe what happened: 
 [ 
My question is, does this mean my funds are potentially "stuck" in a closed channel, as described here?:
 [ 
Still looking for an answer...
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:47:32
I'm assuming they have already deleted their past state, since I recall one of the reasons I deleted the App is due to a newer version being released by Acinq. Any other advice? I can't seem to find any information for this specific issue as I scour the internet, and I haven't gotten any help through their Gitter site.

What does "Gold has spiked" mean? In the last 5 years, gold has "spiked" from $1214/oz to $1466/oz. That's less than 21% appreciation in 5 years. Bitcoin is up from \~$360 to $8200 in that same time period. That's almost 23x.   It's not even close.

This clearly means you were not actually invested in December 2017, otherwise it would be obvious that we are somewhere between along the uptrend of depression. Disbelief begins sometime in Q2 2020 after the halvening, with Hope not too far behind.

This is because doomsday is not right around the corner, even if another great recession occurs. The US Federal reserve could print tens of trillions before we start seeing any serious problems. As of right now, the driving force behind BTC price is the supply schedule/halvenings, which is also why BTC is a great store of value. When you combine a fixed supply with a secure and decentralized network, you get a digital asset that will hold its value over time (as long as a market exists around it).

Sometimes I forget how uninformed most people are with regard to basic operations within the world of finance. And yet, most of these people parade around as "Bitcoin experts" after, like, 10 hours of Bitcoin research. Comical.

In the US by age 50 the "average" net worth is about $600k, while the average 401k balance at age 50 is about $175k; this is about 30% of net worth. Now imagine that this 30% or 175k can be invested into a Bitcoin ETF within this person's Fidelity 401k, or Vanguard 403b, or Paychex 457 plan, or CalPERs/CalSTRS/NY State Pensions.

This chart is front-running too hard. New ATHs are likely to come *after* the May 2020 halvening.
