No, I don't think he does. He's a traditional, conservative-minded old guy. I dont think he'd be into investing in something on the internet.

I didn't think of that. Good idea! I'll have to try that later... you're completely right.

What can I say, I like the work. And I didn't put that much into BTC in 2010 and 2011 as I should have... New York is an expensive place.

I've been leaning that way for months now, but I do enjoy my work at the desk. Do you know anybody I could get in touch with?

HA hire unemployed boss. Didn't think of that. Good idea!
I've been thinking about doing that, but the non-compete at my firm is pretty ironclad ... I'd have a very hard legal fight to take clients with me if I left. Yet another one of the ways that major banks clamp down on potential competition.

Yeah I've seen that bias in action lol
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:58:21
That's what my opinion is too. I was just surprised that he said it.

No, the meeting was all verbal. How would it being in writing help, could you explain that?

I do enjoy the work. I enjoy the thrill of understanding markets, and how politics and central banking affect exchange rates. I didn't put as much into bitcoin in 2010-2011 as I should have ... but I'm rectifying that mistake now. I refer to BTC as my second retirement account lol.

Like I said, I like the work. I also didn't put very much money into it at the time, a mistake I'm rectifying now. But really, I just like the work.

Sorry I missed your question.
I suspect that they would let us use the Winklevii ETF, but I don't think we would sell it on its own. We would probably include that ETF in a basket of other hedge-type ETFs, and sell it as a combined product as a way to hedge against inflation or economic downturns.
Obviously when I talk to my clients I can bring that aspect of it up, at least I hope I can without getting into trouble...
