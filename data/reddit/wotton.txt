Reckon it'll go lower with this ban news?

How will Bitcoin survive if nobody ever uses it as a currency?
You'd be mad to use it to buy anything as the price is so wild you never know what it might be.
So, what's the point of it? Is it just an asset to hold onto?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:22:31
its fantasy though - no central bank will legitimise btc - why would they? btc wants to put them out of business
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:20:19
but if it only has value because its held against a currency like the $ and has no intrinsic use, then it surely will fail at becoming a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:27:36
yes, its to leave banks, but btc is currently just an asset to make more $, far from being its own currency

Chinese banning Bitcoin I hear.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:29:00
Under $5000 in 2 months.
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:07:04
You've seen the price of bitcoin over the past six months right? It's down 50%.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:46:44
They're manipulating the price?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:53:07
It's doomed. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:39:37
How much revenue are you guys making?

Ray is a mad man. He's a genius but is equally as mad.

I do like it when sentences end in 'yo', yo.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:17:23
They've just put a 'trading cooldown' in place.

What exactly is there to say that Satoshi isn't currently rolling around in BTC that he created and then somehow managed to make them valuable out of literal thin air? 
I can't quite understand why anyone would in their right mind currently put money into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:59:25
Why? Companies have to record all their profits, revenue, losses etc.etc.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:43:48
As the price was increasing..
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:54:57
So, give us numbers, yo.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:46:13
Hope your money appears at some point bro.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:05:08
You're going to lose everything. Be prepared.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:16:57
I see your logic, but if he waits long enough and waits for the price to hit $500+ then, bazinga? 
But thanks for the information.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:06:54
Well in the UK they do - companycheck.co.uk.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:44:58
Ah, well, give it some time. Bitcoin tends to be an incredibly laggy system all over.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:38:19
I don't want to start any rumours but I doubt it would go back up - a bug in their system was triple trading which means somewhere they must've lost some money. 
Although I'm not bitcoin expert..
