I did.
@_date: 2018-09-02 23:16:24
that's a big if. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:49:50
It will happen. The rich will drive up the price to mad levels on their run from inflation of FIAT.
@_date: 2018-09-02 23:13:34
you can still get a loan even in an economy with sound money. It's just that the interest rate will likely be higher than with FIAT.
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:59:34
why not? Who's stopping them?
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:15:58
it's not just entry points from fiat\-it's trading pairs. BTC will be dominant until some other crypto has more trading pairs than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:13:58
It's a bit of a precedent in that gold is not inflationary. It's not a precedent because unlike BTC, gold can't be moved across the globe/borders without any limitations.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:13:08
Or IOTA. Litecoin might get into a similar situation in a couple of months. IOTA will always be free.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:10:35
It is mostly free if you're using IOTA. You only pay with ridiculously small amount of electricity when you do POW for a transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:38:21
I haven't. Why would it rise over time? I never heard about this and I've read lots on IOTA.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:00:01
Buy IOTA. It's revolutionary because it has zero fees.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:42:23
Thanks for the reference.


I can't pinpoint this anywhere on the page 3. Bullet point 3 only talks about PoW itself, not about how it is affected by the number of txns.
Why do you think the difficulty will need to be adjusted? I am not disagreeing. I just want to know...
@_date: 2019-10-05 09:27:47
Wait isn't Europe respecting the same sanctions? Why wouldn't Russia just use Chinese Yuan instead?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:28:34
BTC is already too scarce and fees to high that it will never be used to purchase things on daily basis.
BTC does however has unlimited potential when it comes to trading other cryptos. BTC is the dollar of the crypto world. It's the only currency you can use easily to buy any other.
This is the main strength of BTC and why any innovation happening in any other crypto will boost the value of BTC as well. BTC has a bright future. The only currency which might potentially take it down is IOTA, but even if it does it will take couple of years.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:31:25


BTC is very useful and it's usefullnes keeps increasing every minute. Every innovation in crypto space adds value to it. BTC is the dollar of the crypto world. It's the reserve currency. It's the only one you need to purchase if you want to have option to buy any other coin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:36:49


It would need much more than that. Scaling issues are too hard to crack with blockchain. It will never work as replacement for currency. BTC is a gateway from FIAT to crypto world and back. Once another currency can replace it as this gateway, BTC will implode and diminish to zero.
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:34:45
stocks might rise a bit initially, but once inflation hits high enough people won't be able to afford to consume anymore. Wages never rise as fast as the price of goods. You get lowering production and hence slashing profits. Bitcoin will be the only safe haven if we hit significant inflation.
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:50:26
sure it can. For a few years/months, but at some point wages and goods/services start diverging, people start defaulting and you've got a snowball effect. One default leads to money missing in another account and before you know it banks are defaulting.
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:16:46
Well in the real world inflationary economy prices surge much much higher than wages. So workers who are loyal and keep working the same job for the same pay long enough get screwed. In hyper inflationary scenario it gets even crazier- for example in Weimar Republic 1923 you had to go buy food immediately after your shift because next day you wouldn't even get a loaf of bread for your whole day salary from the previous day.
@_date: 2019-04-14 06:50:55
I think they are speculating that Uber could one day start accepting bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:15:21


I've never seen this narrative anywhere. Do you have any links showcasing this?
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:08:40
Oh it will be an option. When you own the printing press and largest military in the world you can always print more money. They'll print them-trillions of dollars and will repay the debt in full. Problem is the resulting inflation will kill the US/EU economy. China/Russia/Japan will switch to bitcoin as reserve currency to save their economies. And that's exactly why you should be saving your wealth in bitcoin, not FIAT in the longterm.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:42:51
yep, BTC is going much further than 20k
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:24:43
couple tweets per day by hardcore bitcoiners? Okay, I was expecting something else when you said 


Something like an article in a journal/newspaper.
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:11:35
You're right, but I was having a much higher inflation in mind than anything we've seen in the last 10 years.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:37:27
then don't confuse anyone and just use spaces
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:38:29
just omit them before the dot
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:43:38
People who trusted the bank with their money are not the ones who pay for it. Actually all the people in the country where a bank goes under pay for the bank. All countries are backing banks in case they are cashless. So bitcoin doesn't prevent bailouts, but it does protect against inflation. Doesn't matter if the cause of an inflation is a bailout or just too much money being created by real estate loans. This is great because most people don't need it to do anything else. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:58:38
there's always truth hidden all the way at the end of the replies chain
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:24:25
I totally agree with you that bitcoin is much better store of value. I only disagreed with the statement that it prevents bailouts.
BTW I am Czech-all bank accounts are backed by the state. Up to 91000 usd. Which is more than enough for most people.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:56:08
The central bank is not able to print more money only when hyperinflation makes printing unfeasible. If that happens, shit has hit the fan and We're all in deep shit.
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:02:36
exactly. It's partly the reason why we I would like to go back to the goold standard. Forcing people to have savings is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:57:31
Matching lenders and loaners? Banks will never be satisfied with just that.
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:10:41
And how exactly does bitcoin prevent bank bailouts?
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:50:06


Yeah because slow and painful death is better than a quick one. Seriously-saving big banks when they screw up is not fair when a family is made homeless when they don't meet their budget and miss mortgage payments. If the bank execs make poor decisions they should suffer. The bank's clients should be saved by the state, not the bank itself.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:45:16
in the areas where young people are. The country side-not so much. That's why the most popular political party is backwardish absolutist ANO.
@_date: 2018-12-23 03:22:27


I'd be shocked if real estate prices drop. If this happens and people start defaulting on their mortgages-banks are screwed.
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:15:53
Lol ordinary people hold so small amounts of BTC that it won't affect the price negatively. Whales will be largely untouched by the recession. On the other hand with recession you'll get lot of rich people looking for a way to escape inflation so I fully expect BTC to have a bull run if there is a recession like 2008 or greater.
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:59:52
And no one bought it. What a shame.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:08:42
No need for a timemachine. Just pick couple of new and solid cryptocurrencies and invest in them now. Wait couple of years and you should be golden. Which ones? Maybe IOTA? I don't know, but if you pick 5 from the top by market cap you can't really miss.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:13:19
all-time high is the worst time to start investing. Buy when it crashes. The harder the crash, the more you might make.
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:13:43
If it's gains you're after, you should have bought IOTA yesterday for your BTCs :D
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:20:25
not if you hold BTC. You'll get plenty of food on black market for your hard earned BTC.
