few questions for you  :
  
(from your website)  
*- Security*
*The minute you enter your API keys, they become encrypted and  stored in memory. Unlike our competitors, your API keys are never  transmitted to our servers in plain text.* 
(Different section from your website)
*Speed &amp; Accuracy*
*Timing is everything, even a one second delay could be the  difference between a profitable trade and a losing one. With Aurox, your  connection to the exchange is direct and secure. Your orders never go  through our server,* ***nor your API keys****, eliminating any delay between our  servers and the exchanges.*   
**So are the API keys transmitted to your servers or not? not in plain text can mean you send them encrypted to your server anyway.**
I don't mind paying for a service but could you let your clients download the software and let them try is for the 14 weeks you promise without asking them for creditcard information or Paypal?  
Also why not let your clients pay in crypto? And while I'm at it offer a 1 year plan with discount ;)
Don't get me wrong from the very short video I'm quite excited as I've been looking for a while for a good solution. Since coinigy is too slow and server based, tradingview is great for charting but can't connect the exchanges that I want to. And if I understand correctly I'll be able to use the same scripts I use on tradingview.
