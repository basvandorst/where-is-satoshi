The reporting about Bitcoin's supposed illegality in Saudi Arabia is disingenuous at best. According to the official government press releases, it seems to be alegal.

Wow, really? Why do you think that?

Since this attack would be coming from central banks and/or governments, we can assume that they have access to practically unlimited money and manpower. So it would be trivial for them to set up a Bitcoin network equal to the current one in scope while also being indistinguishable from nodes on the current network.
Slightly less trivial would be their shutting down existing cypherpunk nodes, but I think it would be possible to shut down a large number of them.
I don't think it would be possible for them to capture a majority of miners, since that would immediately trigger an arms race and the costs would spiral out of control.
So let's agree that 100% capture is not possible via these subversive means, but grant me the point that they could trivially place 80% of the network under their control in the current Bitcoin protocol, leaving 20% in the hands of cypherpunks. Let's also assume they have not a majority of miners, but at least enough to contribute daily to the blockchain (say 5-10%). Let's also assume that they have silenced all cypherpunk voices on all major media outlets including newspapers, magazines, TV, Twitter, Youtube, Medium, etc. and flooded these spaces with their own "experts" so the public cannot distinguish between them (this is important because if they cause a fork, the public will determine which direction the exchanges go).
Would this be enough to successfully pull off a ruleset change of Bitcoin forever?

Yeah but why 2013-2017 specifically
