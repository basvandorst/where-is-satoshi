Why buy coins though? I saw it as a way to make some extra money on the side to pay for bills etc.  Whats the advantages of buying coins and paying for stuff that way? There's nowhere that accept them in my city (Glasgow)

I'll be sticking with bitcoin just to avoid the hassle of exchanging currencies. I don't have enough BTC as of yet to purchase one of these so I checked ebay...£300+. I hate people.

I've had problems with 50btc for the past few weeks aswell. Slow transactions and my btc in the pool isn't updating (or im just not mining anything at all with my block erupter) but nothings updating for me.

How much easier are they to mine in comparison?  One of my friends literally bought me a USB erupter after hearing about my problem.  Will I be able to mine alt coins with it? Sorry, im still fairly new to all this. Thank you :)

I am incredibly jealous. I always thought the idea of having multiple USB miners attached to a hub was a much cooler idea than just buying a black box and plugging it in.l. I just wish the difficulty of the network wasn't so high so you could make a real profit from these little guys. Good luck to you :)

Is there any cheaper USB miners out there at a more reasonable price?  1BTC is far too expensive for the m/  hash they give with the current difficulty.

How do you know?

Mining is becoming less and less fun and more pointless since I only have my GPU and USB erupter. What the fuck will I do now?
