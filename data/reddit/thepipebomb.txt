I definitely care about the price. I want to get rich. I don't care how it gets there.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:08:11
Yup. I can't think of any reason to buy/sell on Coinbase. You just transfer your money to GDAX (free), make your purchase, then transfer back to Coinbase (free).

@_date: 2017-03-08 04:49:01
I bought some Ethereum after the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance news came out last week.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:50:38


Could you elaborate, via PM if necessary?
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:50:11
OK thanks. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:29:08
How are you supposed to access it in 4 days then if you are still using sms? I have to get Google authenticator between now and then?
There isn't even a message on my account explaining this. wtf
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:17:52
Can you add more than 1 CC at a time, and if so is the limit $750 per card or $750 total?
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:05:38
Coinbase is 3.75% for CC and 1.5% for bank account.
3.75% is not significant in the world of bitcoin when you are talking about possible gains of 25-300%.
@_date: 2017-01-01 13:28:32
Yes but I bought 2.5 BTC at $250. Even if I buy a few more at $900-1000 right now, if they are worth $3000 in a year or $5000 in 2 years, then it was still worth it.
Anything is possible but I'm having a hard time finding any analyst who thinks prices will crash this year due to a number of factors. Vinny Lingham was pretty much 100% correct in his predictions for 2016, and he thinks $3000 by end of 2017. Nothing is a given but I tend to heavily weigh opinions by those who have a solid track record along with research I have done on my own.
I would rather try to do something with a small amount of money rather than it sitting in a savings account getting 1%. The risk is there but the potential reward is great.

Google Voice is resistant to number port attacks. By default it's disabled.
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:48:25
Why would I do that when I can just purchase with my credit card and get 2-5% cashback, free extended warranties, and price/fraud protection?
For me bitcoin is an investment and I'll continue treating it that way until/if something changes. It doesn't make any sense to use it for purchasing when I have better, easier options.
I didn't purchase bitcoin to "stick it to the man" or make some kind of political statement. I bought it for the same reason I invested in the stock market, to hopefully make a decent return over many years.
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:38:31


The 10k saved was from working.
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:58:55
At this rate less than 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:34:03
He also recently said $2k-$3k by end of 2017.
Fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:36:51
Interesting suggestion, but it's already almost at $1000. You really think it's going to go back down to $700-800? If not then I'm just wasting time by not putting in $2000-3000 right now before it doubles.
@_date: 2017-01-01 13:55:19
I'm willing to risk almost everything for the hope of a large return over time. Why does that make me have a gambling problem? I have no kids, no one depends on my income and no responsibility to really anything. I don't really need the money, it's just sitting there doing nothing...
I've made 10k before at one summer internship. It wasn't life changing in any way so if I lost it all then whatever, but I really doubt that's going to happen at this point.
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:19:11


I can eat on $75 a month. $50 if I absolutely had to. A lot of spaghetti and cheap stuff. :)
My car is paid off and insurance is ~$200 every 6 months.
Phone bill is $0 I have RingPlus. If you've never heard of it do a google search and you will get more info than I am able to explain here.
Student loan is on IBR plan so I don't owe anything right now since my income is low/nothing. This will continue to be $0 until I have income that triggers a monthly payment, and it won't be re-evaluated for another year.
@_date: 2017-01-19 00:40:11
Sorry, but if btc has any chance of going to tens of thousands of dollars in the near future I'm not spending a dime of it. It has too much value.
Maybe for someone who has hundreds of bitcoins it's not a big deal to spend a few, but for most people who have less than 10 it's not worth it.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:37:23
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:50:32
But what if it's worth $500k in 10 years vs. $250k. That's a lot of regret over a couple grand right now that I'm not really using...
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:45:45










I don't plan on cashing out unless...
A. I am forced to due to lack of funds/no other way to pay my bills.
B. It goes so high that it is life changing and I need to take some out to minimize risk. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:45:41
I bought in at $320, $850, and $900 so I've made like $800 total in the past week.
Just debating whether to go in more within the next few days (minus emergency fund), wait for the price to drop, or keep the rest in savings.
I have like 8 BTC right now and that doesn't seem like a lot but like everyone says you can't predict the future so who knows. It might be worth $800,000 in 10 years or it might be worth $8000 or less.
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:17:25


You can say that but $1000 could also be the new floor. It could rise to $2000 in 3 months and never go back down due to all kinds of things... ETF approval, Trump spending, strong dollar. No one knows.
I understand what you are saying, but less risk, less reward obviously. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:40:40
I have a paid off car and I'm really in no position or have interest in buying a house right now. If I move out it would probably be into an apartment or at a friends house and pay rent.
But like I said, I am not going to get kicked out any time soon (years) so I'm not even worried about it right now.
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:14:11
I'm at about 55% BTC 45% cash right now.

@_date: 2017-01-02 12:03:06
It's already past that.
@_date: 2017-01-21 16:56:09
Yes but if you are using the vault they also need access to your 2nd email and nothing happens for 48 hours so you have time to kill the transaction if you notice suspicious activity.
No system is perfect but honestly I think there is less chance of my google account getting compromised than there is a number port attack. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:28:51
I can't speak for others situation, but even if I lose it all I will still have somewhere to live, and if something happens to my parents I know there is a life insurance policy worth at least $100k on both of them.
This is the main reason why I am considering doing this. No matter what happens I should be OK for at least the next 5 years.

Government pays the interest for up to 3 years. After that it's 2 point something.
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:41:40
Why? It's only 10k, not 100k. It's not making any difference to my life right now, and the upside is huge.
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:31:04
I didn't buy anything when I posted. It was more of a hypothetical question to get feedback. I just picked up 1 more BTC today during the dip. That's enough for now.
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:32:39


Any suggestions?
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:22:04
Not even close. ETH is up 2x BTC this week.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:57:54

If you bought ETH in March you'd be up 16x over Bitcoin.
It's all relative to the timeframe.

28 billion pump and dump? Mmmk. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:10:33
Ether checks those points. It's doing more daily transactions than Bitcoin and fees are cheap.

Plus state taxes. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:56:01
A solid store of value is not something that loses 90% in a short amount of time. That's not to say it's not a good long term investment however.

Well that's pretty stupid then. I can assure you I will be diluting large amounts of BTC/ETH to fiat/stocks/bonds once I'm rich and never looking back.

@_date: 2017-05-28 08:44:00
I was responding to your statement that bitcoin isn't insured. That's incorrect.
Digital Currency
All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. The policy is provided by a syndicate of insurers through Lloyd’s of London. 
Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage.
This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase and GDAX.
