This is not good at all, feel sorry for you
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:54:29
Start with circle, it's easy to use and has reliable feedback 
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:29:44
This looks so good, thanks openBazaar, best with a reason 
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:14:35
Circle is best service than coinbase for sure

Bitcoin has become a viable tool for dark ransom.

Can you tell me about Daniel Roberts, who is he and why he's valuable to bitcoin, thanks
@_date: 2016-04-13 17:42:00
Yes that's what I want the most, thank you 
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:48:53
There're chance to achieve your goal, but can tell for sure cos it depends on what exchange you will use, you location and things like that
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:19:32
I don't thinks so, can see how this is even connected
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:34:15
Wow, that's a lot of money, I'm not sure that legal counseling will solve this kind of problem.
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:26:32
Try to migrate to other wallet, coinbase maybe 
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:56:15
It's all right now, maybe it only you, connected somehow with you location or just it was a temporary problem 
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:30:00
Of course you can use it on Linux
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:15:51
Too bad to hear this, get well soon Kumamoto and please donate with coincheck 
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:27:24
So switch to another service, there's other options despite coinbase 
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:28:38
Lol, that make me laugh, true story 
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:29:17
Thanks for sharing, I'll make sure I do

"May" is a soft word, they really do more damage than good
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:24:35
I still can figured out how will this work offline,but still I'm delight to use it
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:01:59
Do you try with  ?
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:58:49
It's too bad, but how they figured out that money where converted to bitcoin and that lead to him?
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:51:31

@_date: 2016-04-16 17:57:22
How is this connected with bitcoin core, article refers to Bitcoin Price Analysis
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:09:39
Why will coinkite will be closed?
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:18:13
Form my point of view maybe it a little bit late for mining, but if someone have proper equipment, should give it a try
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:41:17
Fear is the more present part in this trinity
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:30:39
So will they transfer those money in bitcoins or something ?
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:53:29
It's not a great service. I have troubles registering my credit card, so I switched to circle and works perfect 
@_date: 2016-04-15 16:07:38
Such a great info thanks bitcoin core
@_date: 2016-04-15 18:39:28
How this work, and when it will be available in other regions?
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:40:08
I can't see your point, what you mean by this ?
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:36:39
Correct, I can not figured out what he means with this quote 
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:49:56
Why? What happened? "Apparently it's facing some pushback from the government." what this means ? Thanks 
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:15:45
Gavin is not 100% sure too, he still wants to see more proof.
