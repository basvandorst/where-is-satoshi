"When something goes parabolic like this has, it typically ends up to where that parabola began," Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, recently told CNBC. "I wouldn't be surprised if over the next year it's down to $1,000 to $3,000," he added.

just folks saying a lot of the platforms and products growing up around crypto are about as risky as such things can get as an investment play - and by and large you have no remedy recourse whatsoever even for outright fraud - that's the fact jack - so if you throw the dice and lose it's on you cause its totally buyer beware - just like if you win - your choice

I totally agree with this point - exchange trading is what has diverted Bitcoin from an alternative currency project into a commodity/securities/asset and opened the door for government reg over-reach and big player control of such markets - here are some imho interesting resources that support that contention in general:

In Seoul, after an emergency meeting on Wednesday, South Korea’s government said it will consider taxing capital gains from trading of virtual coins and will also ban minors from opening accounts on exchanges, according to a statement obtained by Reuters ahead of its official release. To be eligible, exchanges in South Korea will need to uphold investor protection rules and disclose all bid and offer quotes. The measures need parliamentary approval. Seoul will maintain a current ban on all financial institutions dealing virtual currencies. ..."

seems to me lurking problem with this wide range of spot volatility and overall drifting downward trend is a huge overhang of folks waiting for a return to say $12K to get the heck out and never return, and even more at $15K - so rest of HODL strategy market players will have to wait for all that - i.e., run up, sell out, dive down; wash, rinse, repeat - to shake out, which may take at least the rest of the year - after that I think the stabilization level range will be around $15K sometime into next year and then after that only drift up with general inflation rates, i.e., 3-5% per year - a stable investment option, but not great; would be fun if it took fire again, but I doubt it, gov't regs have now moved in big time, wild big party's over - but it's been undeniably a heck of a lot of fun for the past few years!

He currently represents California's 30th congressional district within the San Fernando Valley, in Los Angeles County 
... he was by far the most clueless - and I think that's about all his input amounts to - rest of two hour hearing stuff was actually substantive and constructive - 
Btw - to start watching the whole hearing you have to skip about 22 min into the YouTube vid to catch the actual opening  (there was some sort of delay so Committee spashscreen ran for first 22 min  ...
We had fun on the /bitcoinmarkets subreddit commenting live

all of which is not to gainsay the fundamental absolute brilliance of the BTC code structure - it's so algorithmically robust, mathematically elegant, and cryptologically sound that, imho, it will continue to reliably provide utility in appropriately related business model use cases, and thus also for markets for related financial derivatives products, that it will continue to be assigned significant intrinsic economic valuation well into the next decade midpoint

I don't view that BTC ever "crashed"- it dipped to a previous level - $6k - and then has steadily re-achieved the $10k level at stable increments ...
"Crash" is " crash &amp; burn" as in strewn about wreckage - and that hasn't happened, nor, imho, is it likely to do so in the reasonably foreseeable future ..
BTC is a young thin market susceptible to swings - but it has proven itself again and again as an emergng asset class to be remarkably robust in the face of galeforce headwinds from, to name just a few,  Asian gov'ts regulatory vagaries, entrenched establishment financial sector FUD, etc. etc. e- and yet the underlying technology marches on fantastically strong - almost 10 years and counting and still the BTC tech is surviving and thriving out in the wild completely decentralized and self-sustaining ...

What I used to luv were the live Skype corporate staff meetings and live tours of the alleged mining server farm warehouses he used to stage - to tell the truth I kinda liked following the whole thing as it emerged, attempted launch, sputtered and then crashed &amp; burned - never could quite wrap my head around that what with the live online trading market platform - which actually worked (if, of course you got out in time) - it was all just somehow a scam - his biggest mistake, other than being an inveterate scamster apparently, may have been trying the thing out onshore USA - offshore he'd probably just walked away ...
If the SEC really manages to collect the $20 million fine out of the wreckage wonder who will get that ...

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 23885 / July 25, 2017
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Homero Joshua Garza, GAW Miners, LLC, and ZenMiner, LLC, No. 15-cv-01760 (D. Conn. filed Dec. 1, 2015)
United States v. Homero Joshua Garza, No. 17-cr-158 (D. Conn. filed July 20, 2017)
Former Connecticut Resident Pleads Guilty to Criminal Charges in Connection With Digital Bitcoin Mining Fraud
On July 20, 2017, Homero Joshua Garza, a defendant in a pending SEC civil fraud action, pled guilty in federal court in Connecticut to criminal charges in connection with his scheme to defraud investors in a digital bitcoin mining fraud in 2014 and 2015. Garza is currently scheduled to be sentenced in October 2017.
The criminal charge arises largely from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's complaint filed on December 1, 2015. The SEC alleged that GAW Miners and ZenMiner, along with their principal, Garza, purported to offer shares to investors in their digital bitcoin mining operation. Mining for bitcoin or other virtual currencies means applying computer power to try to solve complex equations that verify a group of transactions in that virtual currency. The first computer or collection of computers to solve an equation is awarded new units of that virtual currency. According to the SEC's complaint, GAW Miners and ZenMiner did not own enough computing power for the mining they promised to conduct, so most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed. Returns paid to some investors came, not from successful mining activity, but from proceeds generated from sales to other investors.
On June 2, 2017, the court entered a final judgment against GAW Miners and ZenMiner, permanently enjoining each of them from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering each entity to pay, jointly and severally, approximately $10 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1 million each. Both GAW Miners and ZenMiner have ceased their former business operations.
The SEC's litigation continues against Garza.
