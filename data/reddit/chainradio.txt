Chain Radio has been offline while we reevaluate our business plan and structure. We can assure you that we are not owned by GAW Miners, GAW or Josh Garza.

Backed by but without being able to transfer to stock are different things.

Thanks very much for that! We will keep working on expanding our lineup of content!

How do we know he deleted his accounts?

Just gave this AMA a shoutout on the air but also am curious as to what BitPay is thinking regarding this question, you are bringing all of these new merchants to the table but what are your plans regarding this regulation? What is your stance?

Setup some tokens on Counterparty like OPTION1, OPTION2, OPTION3 and have them send them to an address?

Weird, that link doesn't work for me. I wouldn't have seen this one either if it wasn't for RSS. The link you shared just keeps giving me an error message from reddit.
Time to clear the ole cache I suppose.

Noticed that as well. How can anyone trust them now? Saw Brock Pierce is tweeting at them which disturbs me in that they have lied to the press outright and consumers about Mintpal.

No reason to be an asshole, they did the right thing.

I am not Mike.
Edit: When did Coin Fire turn in to a fluff blog? Last I checked it is one of the three most legitimate news sources for bitcoin news on the internet.

I didn't read it as pissy. I read the first comment as pissy though.
It is nice to have some insight as to what is going on behind the scenes.

We just pressured them to release the code as well. They were fast to fix the issue, because you are right.
They posted it at that link.

If he does have something I hope he sees this and decides to go one of those routes. I am guessing though if he does go that route it will be months of research before we hear anything again.

Refuse to click on the newsbtc link after they started pumping paycoin, and called those who question it "cryptoextremists".
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:32:45
We will be using you for our exchanges always moving forward. Nice work.

They'd destroy the ability to get confidential information?
Having met Mike *in person* and knowing who he is connected with in real life, I have zero doubt he can get these real connections.
That literally makes no sense.

Pumpers of paycoin scam, called bitcoin users who question paycoin cryptoextremists. NewsBTC is dead to me.

EPIX can be viewed online and on nearly any device. They offer a great trial period as well. They are one of the few networks you can get online without needing cable or sat. Very awesome.

I am certain they have higher priorities at the moment.
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:06:13
Going to vouch that this is in fact Mike after texting him a bit ago.
Also, great use of blockchain to verify this post.
Sad to see this happen but know things will get better.

No.
