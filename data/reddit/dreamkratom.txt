Lmao you're sooooo clueless are you a kid In high school? Or your moms basement?
You call losing 99% mild inflation? You're parading around a small 60% drop in btc. After a 142,000% increase. 
US dollar is powerful bc petrodollar , in 30's USA took the worlds gold and gave out dollars then Nixon told the world they aren't getting their gold back. It was a gold grab by the powers that be. 
Also bc oil is traded on the usd. Once that ceases usd won't be shit just like you loser. 
Us isn't number one either, it's the 3rd strongest currency. And falling behind in many categories. But again dumbfucks are dumb, like you.

George Soros ruined more people than all cryptocurrencies combined. You don't have a clue what you're talking about, you're "educating" me? Lmao you don't know shit about anything it seems like. You need to learn about George Soros and stop sucking his dick you fanboy. 
Losing 99% of the total value of something is not mild. Before central banks in America 1$ bought you the same in 1776 as it did in 1876. And America prospered bc money wasn't being taken out of circulation into the hands of very few. 
You are legit the biggest dumbass I've ever had the pleasure of speaking with. You take the cake lol. It's so funny I can't wait to show people and laugh at you with them. 
Your family is in bad shape having you for a leader. They don't even have a real chance.

Usd is down 15% recently and hasn't gained 142,000% over the past 9 years.
Actually usd has lost 99% since 1913. But you're a dumbfuck so you don't know.
