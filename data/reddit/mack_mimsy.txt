If I did more homework I wuda known the exit alts and keep the balance at Bittrex. I did go LTC to BTC which is the only reason I had a balance in the 1st place. The majority was offline. This was surprisingly predictable I just didn't give it enough thought. Ya live n learn I guess but a new toy wuda been nice
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:23:55
It depends on what ur getting for the premium ur paying. I don't pay premiums like that bc I'm not trying to, for instance, hide my btc from the gov knowing I have it or purchasing goods on the dark markets. I use exchanges that I've done KYC at bc I want the lowest price possible. Additionally, hiding ur btc from the gov is harder than most ppl think. U have to know what ur doing to be successful. So, if the premium is worth it I'd pay it but if your inexperienced I'd use an exchange like GDAX or coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:26:55
If SW2x takes majority hash power isn't this more of miners deciding the future of btc instead of the market!?!  Who's gonna use Core if the mining power dries up and blocks take forever to mine?  If SW2x is successful and becomes BTC this is a devastating blow to Bitcoin bc (imo) it proves that with enough $ anyone can come in &amp; change the btc protocol. AFAIK core has overwhelming support from users and the miners will take that away. This is not how Bitcoin is suppose to work

I speculate Bcash will make a run at user adoption and miners from the btc community. What that looks like I don't know but expect a rocky road over the coming months if they start making headway soon
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:22:16
I'm calling bullish but rocky roads thru SW activation. That game plan changes if ��coin gains traction tho. LN is gonna be a game changer too. There's a lot of exciting Shizz going on right now. I'm monitoring block counts &amp; mining capacity on both chains, ��coin will get a bump from diff threshold lowering. There's a ton more I could add but it'd take way to much time. There's a lot to consider. What events are you expecting?
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:02:59

Unfortunately, it's standard practice but only do it if it's worth it to you. See my other rely for more insight
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:56:25
That's 4.5%, better than most BTM's. If u want cheap fees send bank transfer to GDAX and buy the coin yourself on the exchange. Down side is u have to wait 5 days til $ is confirmed and who knows what price will be then. I sent when price was $1,500, 5 days later when I cud buy it was $2,200. I wud have gladly paid the 4.5% you speak of
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:30:54
It's unfortunate but the amount of speculation on these forks is amazing. How the fuck is Bcash worth so much?  If the speculators move to SW2x that's where the problem lies.

USD is backed by nothing but faith in our government, do u live under a rock!?!  Venezuela's currency was backed by their government too, and Zimbabwe, and Greece and the fucking list goes on. Bitcoin is backed by the fact it's an escape route from an our traditional bullshit, nothing but crap fiat system. That what u tell that douchebag ur dealing with 
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:01:49
I was referring to the surprising predictability of BCC being worth so much. A lot like the SEC decision was  predictable. Where I really fuct up was not knowing Bittrex would honor the coin split so I moved some coin offline. I should have seen this coming a mile away. It was a stupid mistake especially calc'ing what I could have made in a days time
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:01:22

I've calmed down a lot since then. It was after studying it for 2 years and the realization I still didn't know shit that put me in my place hahaha. There's so much to Bitcoin it's mind boggling. Now I'm part of a network of people that talk on a daily basis about everything from code to simply buying. We have a nice collection and we all bring something to the table. I mostly contribute trading knowledge. We have guys that have been in it since 2009 and some that contribute code. It's nice to have a network of btc junkies. Get the MeetUp app and look for crypto meet ups in your area. What part of the world are u in?
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:19:41
Agreed ��%!!!  I've stayed up for days on end fulfilling minimal requirements to stay alive to learn about Bitcoin... I fell down the rabbit hole &amp; haven't seen daylight since. I might need a 12 step program at some point ��
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:32:54
In all likelihood ur right ��coin will tank, I can see it being attractive to miners especially since the diff recalc'd and they have various merchant support. I expect the Ambiguously Gay duo to play their cards when the time is right to increase adoption. Remember the kill switch Jihan added to his rigs? Or it could be another spam campaign to clog the mempool. I wudn't be surprised if they pulled something just after a btc diff change.  
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:46:48
It's Magic Internet Money. Period. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:12:05
They change a %, that's how they get it. As for them running out, this wouldn't happen bc there's always a buy and seller. When the sellers outweigh the buyers it drives the price down, when the buyers outweigh the sellers that drives the price up. They never run out of btc because they aren't the ones selling/buying in most cases, it's an open market place, they're just providing the platform where people come together to trade. As for Coinbase, they take the incoming orders and buy/sell the coin for you (&amp; charge u a fee) on their exchange: GDAX. even GDAX always have buyers and sellers. Hope this clarifies it for u
Side note: I wudn't put it past some exchanges to place buy/sell orders on their own exchange to manipulate the price
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:25:27
That's all crazy speculation, McAfee said he'd eat his own dick if btc isn't $500k by 2020 which is possible but not likely. No way to tell what the price will be but imo $10k by end of year is a decent target. That's only 4x gains and when SegWit activates it'll be a massive milestone for Bitcoin. I think we'll see a proliferation of sidechain activity driving the price upward and by next year the demand for btc will outpace the supply. A lot like what happened with ETH, except I believe the code will be better in most cases and better protections in place. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:49:38
Time for a pow change??? J/k
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:40:41
When ppl HODL it lowers the overall supply and raising the value due to the raising demand.  It's useful as a currency but most won't spend it right now and the ones that do usually immediately regret it, myself included. It's not going to hurt Bitcoin if ppl don't spend it right now, it'll do just fine as a store of value. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:42:31
I still think $10k is possible this year. Dude, Reddit is timing my responses to 5 min. I have to wait between comments. Wtf

Write a Python script to extrapolate the data. Also, this information may already be available. I'd do some digging 1st to see if it's on the interwebs
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:55:55
Did you successfully login? 
What wallet has a balance in it? 
Click on the wallet with the balance? If all accounts have 0 balance check all wallets for transaction history. Where did it go? If it was transferred was it authorized? Did you ever have a balance? Check your bank history to make sure Coinbase still has your funds, it's possible they refunded you or they're in the middle of refunding you. Ask your bank to check this for you. If you're sure Coinbase still has your money and you legitimately can't find it you'll need to start the long process of contacting customer support.
Good Luck,

The real reason not to buy from them is they call it Bitcoin Core. Every noob onramp charges a premium + a fee to cover the spread. I haven't paid a fee to buy Bitcoin in years.

@_date: 2019-06-26 07:51:14
best practice is to hold your own bitcoin. Get it off the exchange. To answer your question, yes they could go out of business or get hacked or any number of reasons you could lose your coin. I'm not familiar with Robinhood, so I don't know if you bought Bitcoin or not. Looking at the site it shows bitcoin and not a derivative like you find at BitMex. Withdrawal your coin as soon as possible

What's shitty is his death penalty analogy that doesn't even relate and his misguided thought that I was suggesting moving the airbag to encourage safe driving. I appreciate intelligent and witty remarks that hold truth and cohesion to the OP.  This is one bullshit tangent after another.  My case in point is us discussing how to address one another in a fucking disagreement. I was giving my tl:dr version of the article as asked which was an appropriate response. FOR THE LOVE OF CRYPTO AND ALL THE NOOBS THAT NEED OUR HELP STICK TO THE FUCKING POINT. 
Talk about your version of the article or how you see it like everyone else has instead of filling this sub with bullshit. I'm rough around the fucking edges and I like the way I am but this sub isn't a self-help program, this is real life shit. I think our political and financial system has fucked over 99.9% of all of us and this article is one more example of it. I think it'd be great if the government went after Dimon for price manipulation as others suggested but history has taught us that a law "marketed" as consumer protection rarely produces and is usually a ploy. I know people are reading this as good news but I think anything that comes from the gov has hidden strings and consequences. I wouldn't be surprised if the laws produced from the outcome are really designed to protect JP Morgan when they release some shit fiat backed crypto in the future. Mark my words on this one, there's no way in hell the gov is going after Dimon for the bullshit he spewed. They'd more likely throw Charlie Lee in jail for his FUD twitter post then the CEO of a large corporation. If there's anything the 2008 crash taught me it's this, The new Golden Rule: The one with all the gold makes the rules. This SEC headline is designed to protect the wealthy. Did you see what I just did there, I brought if full circle dude because that was my original comment. Please stick to the post because there's to much to learn about Bitcoin to waste time with anything else. Happy Bitcoining!

More regulation coming to an exchange near you!
They're creating initiatives to protect their cherished wall st investors instead of making them pay for their mistakes. It's the same logic as adding air bags to protect shitty drivers instead of putting them up front (Ol' Skool VW Bus) so they'll drive safer. If all drivers were scared of dying in an accident we'd have a lot less accidents. I say let shitty investors lose money or do the necessary research to make an educated decision. I'm a trader with very few loses on the books, I know what the fuck I'm buying and why, I don't need the SEC to protect me because when it comes to trading I'm sitting up front and driving as carefully as possible.  
They're also beefing up divisions to monitor "fraud" &amp; "price manipulation." My guess is we'll have manipulation laws in a few short years.
