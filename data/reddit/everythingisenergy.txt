It is because bitcoin cash is run by a con artist. If you use it to make money, you take it from people that are ignorant to the fact that it is a fraud. Everyone who promotes bitcoin cash is a PAID reddit shill. Follow Andreas antonopolis on twitter for truth.

Imagine two wallets spamming each other a dollar of btc back and forth and clogging the blockchain with trivial transactions. This would raise fees, aka benefit miners. Swgwit did away with that somewhat. Swgwit is more then just a good idea in general, it cuts the possibility of gaming the network down. Support it!

Then buy more then too. BTC is here to stay and real pros are not going to sell till 100k at a minimum
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:50:48
Anyone care to explain?

They are supposed to but have never supplied the proof. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:45:03
Its way more complex
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:28:22
What do you mean?

Yes and it sold on coinbase for what 2 hours!? So the price b.cash skyrocketed and then the instant dump, and then coinbase turned off trading bcash acting innocent af, like they caught a pump and dump, but are probably just financially inside each other. So no regulations means no one can do shit. Except rodger ver is such a goddam idiot, please god let him get legally boned. 15 years prison time maybe. In the perfect world.

Ignorant little man, what is your agenda? His argument is nonsense, and it is FUD. You are what is wrong, you are just playing devils advocate and not providing any depth. You dont make money illegal because ransoms were invented. Clown
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:35:34
Bad advice. Telling people it will go on natural boom bust cycles is better advice. Thanks.

Instead lets go do something useful because blabbing about money laundering, which is done with or without crypto currency and a *perceived*  criminal mining problem, which is so benign it is a godamn joke,  is all a bunch of pointless internet conjecture. 
The point is that this is absolute drivel and it would be nice if the media stopped the FUD against crypto, and put out some more relevant and  mlre valid information.
