Great video. At least watch the crucial 'Metallica tickets' part from at 24:02 for few minutes:

That's nothing. Once I booked a flight using my card. Next day tried to withdraw cash - no luck, account balance show $0, though I knew I have some money - what the hell is going on. Went to the bank's branch, the lady printed out some secret sheet with pending transaction and I saw airlines charged me 3 times, ffs, some $1000 extra. Spent 2 hours arguing with her, apparently they can't do anything - I have to contact the merchant and ask them to reverse the transaction. No phone number on the airlines website, just some shitty web form which you fill and wait. And here I am, texting 'Please, your majesty airlines, you accidentally charged me $1000 extra, my bank account is frozen, I am not able to buy food'. Waiting, waiting... After 3-4 days, my money was back, like it never happened. Airlines get back to me in a week 
This payment system does not belong in 21st century.

- How would you use Ven?
- We have credit cards coming that would run on Visa, Mastercard rails. So basically who would hold that card would hold Ven balance on the cloud ... and that's interesting because Ven is partially backed by carbon, so basically it means it's first green environmental currency in the world and it means that everyone who's using Ven for their payments is creating environmental benefit related to the transaction.

I keep hearing: you can prove authenticity, designer goods will be stamped in the blockchain. Or diamonds. Or organic fruit and veg. Anyone care to explain how it would be done in a practical way?

@_date: 2015-07-02 11:05:51
You can get paid back in both, it doesn't matter. Ok, let's make an example. Say current price is $250. You go 10 btc short ($2500). Price goes down 50%. Your profit is $1250 or 10 btc (at current price), there's no difference, some exchanges even ask you what currency you want your profits to be paid back in. Also what fees are you talking about?

Not sure if that's what you ask, but that's what leverage is for. If you go short x10 risking 1 btc, what it essentially means is that you profit from 10 btc loosing value.
@_date: 2015-07-02 08:40:34
You hedge. Say you had 2500 euros and bought 10 bitcoins with it. Keep 9 btc securely by yourself (say paper wallet). Put 1 btc on a futures exchange and open short position with 10x leverage. Now what will happen, if bitcoin goes up your locally kept stash will gain value exactly same amount as your hedge position will loose. Or vise versa. Of course you have to take into account counter party risk, that the exchange can go bust.
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:16:16
Not so much. Official rate is 10x lower than black market, and if you exchange on black market you are basically committing a crime.

Suppose money came from a stolen card - winnings has to be withdrawn to the same card (as per aml policy). Where's the damage, who's the victim? The owner of a stolen card now would have more money.

I'm not familiar with this project. But this is how I think it could be done.
Imagine browser cache. Everyone is responsible for what's in their browser cache - stuff you've pulled from the internet lately. Now what if instead of pulling that youtube video of the internet, you could pull it from the guy sitting just next to you in the same room? Bandwidth saved, quicker, everyone's happier. That's what ipfs is trying to do, everyone should be carrying their own ipfs node (browser cache analogy). You could put an image in your cache, and share it with the internet it's how it would be distributed. But no one would be interested in your petabytes of /dev/random so it would only exist in your local node.
The OP is just sharing his node for us to have a glimpse, you can fuck it up uploading petabytes of rubbish, but no other nodes will want it and it won't get copied.

I didn't gamble for long time until this week and had a chance to try 4 different online sportsbooks. Among them one using bitcoin. The difference on cashing in/out experience is jaw dropping.
Ordinary sporstbook:
* House edge 4-5%
* KYC nonsense, upload your id. In one instance they had **maybe we can ask for proof of address. 'Maybe'??? Maybe when I need to cash out $2k?!
* Once I tried to deposit using 'Fast bank transfer'. Same bank. Normally it's instant in my country. I waited two days, and then had to send their support an email with pdf of the transaction. Horrible.
Bitcoin sportsbook:
* House edge ~2.5%
* Instant (!) deposit, start betting once you click send button on your wallet. They don't even care about confirmation.
* Almost instant withdrawal. Minutes, compared to days using old fashioned system.
Once we solve bitcoin volatility problem, I just don't see how would someone want to ride those dinosaurs anymore.

Two weeks ago I was travelling in San Jose, Costa Rica and thought it would be nice to cover some of my travel expences by selling some coins. I found a guy on localbitcoins and soon we met in a weekly farmer's market where he and his girlfriend had a stand selling silver jewelry. It was very exciting - we made the deal and talked a lot about new digital currency. Then he expressed a desire to open an online shop selling his stuff for bitcoins but lacking technical knowledge. I offered to help and then we worked for couple of days putting all the things together. And here we are, just on time for Bitcoin Black Friday!
Let us know what you think or how we could improve.

And here we meet on r/Bitcoin. Amazing!
