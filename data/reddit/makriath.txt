Ok, I think I see the point of confusion.  In my other comment, I clarified how things have changed since the whitepaper was written, so I'd suggest you read that first.
Specialized miners being separate from the average user running a node is not caused by people holding their funds on exchanges and not running nodes.
The cause of this is because of the development of increasingly specialized mining equipment and pooling causing mining to be an incredibly competitive industry, so it is no longer economical to mine from your home computer.
Even for most people (like myself) who store their own Bitcoin and run their own node, it doesn't make economic sense to mine.
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:21:01
Yeah, I tend to (quietly and internally) celebrate price crashes nowadays.
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:15:46
Yeah, if one is in it for the long haul, these short-term price swings are irrelevant.  10 years from now, Bitcoin's price will be determined by how far we have progressed in terms of scalability, fungibility, and layering a good UX on top of that.  Widespread adoption might also be affected somewhat by the timing of the next one or two financial crashes.
Short- or medium-term news can safely be ignored, from my POV.

And "they" (whoever they are) would be 100% correct, because the dollar basically *already does* reflect the wider economy already (which itself includes significant wealth inequality).
@_date: 2018-05-28 07:52:16
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:38:49
Ok, that helps.
FYI some of the terms in the whitepaper are outdated and their meanings have changed.  We don't talk about "CPU power" to describing mining power any more, since specialized hardware (ASICs) are the dominant mining computers nowadays.  The word "hashpower" is a more precise term.
It's an important distinction because CPU power is often used to describe computing resources that a full (non-mining) node needs to validate and check the blockchain.
When Satoshi wrote the whitepaper, mining pools and ASICs didn't exist, so there was no distinction between full (non-mining) nodes and miners.

Simple answer:
Decentralization refers to the operation and validation of the network.
OP appears to be conflating this with wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.
Lengthier answer:
Decentralization ensures that there is no single point of failure for the network, and no authority can censor transactions, halt the network, etc.
The uneven distribution of wealth is an entirely separate issue.  That is not to say it's not a concern, but it has nothing to do with decentralization in the sense we usually speak about here.
Also, the statistic quoted in the OP isn't as damning as it might seem at first bluff.  This is because the division of wallets aren't necessarily representative of the division of users in the network.
To begin with, there are a TON of unused wallets, that would count toward the bottom 96.81% of wallets by BTC holdings.  This will include wallets that have acquired dust and are still in use from a technical perspective, but de facto aren't.  This will further skew this metric.
Also, as has been pointed out elsewhere, a lot of users keep their funds on exchanges (even though they shouldn't) so that will appear to be a single entity holding Bitcoin, when in reality, it is hundreds or thousands of different people.
Now, it's entirely possible that the situation is even worse than the statistic indicates, if less than 3% of the users are in possession of the 3.19% of wallet owning most.  There isn't, however, any evidence to support this, and seems extremely unlikely to me.
For a last point, unequal distribution is almost certainly going to decrease over time to reflect the wider economy as time goes on.
If the OP can provide the source for the claim, we might be able to dig in deeper and infer a bit more.
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:54:39
I'm having a very hard time understanding your question.

To be clear, I'm not predicting this will happen.  I hope it doesn't, and I think it's likely that if it comes down to a core/BU split, core will retain enough hashpower/economic support to survive the first difficulty adjustment, at which point, we should be home free.
But I think it's good to be prepared for these extreme scenarios.
As for this idea:


I hope this happens, but we can't guarantee it.  Also, this assumes that the attacker doesn't have more hashpower, which might not be the case.
As I said, I don't think that these extreme situations are likely, but right now it's a lot of talk about reacting to worst-case scenarios.

@_date: 2017-03-27 03:52:53
While I do agree that big blockers tend to exaggerate the effects of full blocks, I think we ourselves should also be careful not to mischaracterize the situation.
Personally, I also haven't experienced long delays, but *that doesn't mean that it doesn't ever happen*.
For someone who uses bitcoin daily, it does seem pretty plausible that times with a huge mempool, they'll experience significant delays.  It would seem unfair and alienating to someone who's experienced that to imply that 5 cents getting into the second block later is normal.
Don't get me wrong, I'm still a proponent of core's roadmap, but let's not make the mistake of trumpeting faulty arguments.

[From our FAQ](




@_date: 2019-03-22 01:20:37
With each new UTXO in your wallet, we send you presigned timelocked transactions. If our servers ever become inaccessible (or you lose access to all your 2FA methods), you will just need to wait for the timelock to expire, and then using the presigned transactions, your mnemonic, and our garecovery tool, you will be able to reclaim your funds.
@_date: 2019-03-22 01:26:16
We've got a very quick [video tutorial up here]( and we will shortly be releasing a more detailed explanation at [our documentation page right here](
@_date: 2019-03-20 22:02:52
The biggest thing that sets us apart is our 2of2 multisignature model, which allows us to offer 2FA security, but also keeps users in full possession of their funds (it is impossible for us to steal from you, or unilaterally move your funds). It's a "best of both worlds" type deal.
If you want to know how it works in greater detail, check out the last two sections of [this page.](
On top of that, we definitely engineer our wallet to guide users toward safer usage to minimize losses - for example, we ensure that any new users have properly recorded their mnemonic before allowing them to continue.
And I'm totally biased...but I do think we have the sleekest UI out there.
I could keep going about the many other cool features that we offer, but you're probably better off reading the blog post in the OP, or the documentation I linked above if you want to know about that stuff.
Feel free to ask me if you have any more questions.
@_date: 2019-03-20 22:05:23
Ah, I see what you mean. The multisig transactions will still be larger than single-sig transactions, even with native SegWit. That's the tradeoff for 2FA security.
Now, once we can sink our teeth into taproot...different story ;)

Slight correction - we do store one of the two keys.


No, that won't affect the connectivity at all. Because of our 2FA security model, we store one of the private keys for the wallet, so you will need to be connected to our server to create a wallet or send a transaction.

Hardware wallets do not allow you to bypass 2FA. What a hardware wallet does is handle login and transaction signing. But you'll still need to confirm 2FA when sending.
[This video]( shows how hardware wallets work with Green (including the 2FA process starting at 40s in).
@_date: 2019-03-22 01:14:57


That's correct. We'll be changing the name of it to "Two factor threshold in an upcoming update so that the name is clearer.
And here's an example [I outlined on twitter]( just to make sure it's clear:






Well, it's better security than a single-signature wallet because it means that you are still safe even if someone steals your mnemonic. But it is still not optimal security. Your best best is using 2FA methods that exist on separate devices.


We strongly recommend using at least 2 different 2FA methods, just in case one goes missing. You can always get your coins back eventually, even if you lose your 2FA, but it can result in long time delays (you'll need to wait for the timelock transactions to become valid or go through our 2FA reset process, which has at least a 1 year waiting period).
Much better to have a backup 2FA method, just in case :)

The native segwit address will have a smaller weight when we add it. But the reasons you stated above (not all services being able to send to bech32 yet), we are still using wrapped p2sh to ensure compatibility with all other bitcoin services.
@_date: 2019-03-23 19:51:09
That's correct. From Green you cannot "watch" or arbitrary wallets or utxos, we only support watch-only of other Green wallets. What you can do is simply pass your watch-only username/password combination to anyone else with a Green wallet, and they can log in to your wallet's watch-only on their device.

It depends.  As I understand it, there are theoretical attacks that could cripple a coin so severely immediately following a fork that it doesn't even survive until the next difficulty period.
If/when there is a hardfork, both chains will be mining more slowly, since existing hashpower will be split between them.
Let's say there is a malicious mining pool who supports the side that already has more hash power.  What they could do is start mining empty blocks on the weaker side.  Or if they were powerful enough, they could mine several empty blocks, and delay broadcasting them, causing other "legitimate" blocks mined on that chain to be orphaned.
Either of these actions (there are probably other things they could do as well) would likely result in lower trust and usability on that chain, which might drive more users to the stronger chain.  This could create a spiral effect: poorer usability -&gt; lower price -&gt; less incentive to mine -&gt; reduced hashpower -&gt; slower blocks -&gt; poorer usability.
I believe that it is only in response to some sort of attack like this (that is, one that would cause existential risk to the chain), that a PoW change is seriously being considered atm.

I believe that the compartmentalization factor is mainly for school buses.
But how about the size and speed factors referred to?
Buses, being larger and traveling slower (not going on highway, for example), generally expose passengers to less risk.  Not none, of course, as the gif shows.
But it seems likely to me that the explanation lies in a cost/benefit analysis of how much harm is mediated vs how much it would cost to install and enforce bus passengers using seatbelts (not to mention the added loading and unloading time at stops).
That seems a lot more likely to me than the "governments are just stupid" argument.

Hi there, thanks for your interest!
1) Connecting to your own full node is just for checking your transactions to ensure that our servers aren't feeding false information. It is not used for sending/pushing transactions.
2) While we recommend that you don't use a 2FA method attached to the same device as your wallet, that will still offer more protection over other wallets. If someone steals your mnemonic from a single-signature wallet, they can move your funds. With Green they would also need to steal your 2FA. In this case, mnemonic wouldn't only cut it - they'd also need your phone.
3) You can use an existing hardware wallet that already has a key installed, or you can use a fresh one, it's up to you. In either case, when accessing your hw wallet using Green, you will being in a completely different wallet than if you just accessed the hw wallet by itself. This is because Green wallets are multisig - based one 2 private keys. One of those will be the wallet's key, and the other is on Green servers.
For example, let's say that you have a ledger with 1BTC on it. If you plug your ledger in and access it through Green, you will see a fresh wallet, with no funds. You can start using that wallet, because it's brand new. But if you exit Green and reaccess your ledger through the normal method, you will be accessing your original wallet with the 1BTC.
This simple answer is that yes, they can coexist.

If the blockchain is still being peppered with non-full blocks, then it's not permanently full.
Also, if you take a look at that block's position, and it's timing relative to the last two blocks, it seems pretty likely that it wasn't just a miner mining an empty one for the lols, it's because it was mined pretty quickly and there isn't a huge backlog to catch up with.

Earth Bitcoin Mining:  sunlight passes through atmosphere, losing some energy -&gt; harnessed as electricity -&gt; converted into bitcoin blocks
Space Bitcoin Mining: sunlight harnessed as electricity -&gt; converted into bitcoin blocks -&gt; blocks sent down to earth
I agree that Peter Todd could have worded it much more clearly, but the idea is that you don't lose any value sending blocks down to earth, but sunlight does lose energy when it passes through the atmosphere.

I toyed around with the idea of advertising (r/BitcoinDiscussion: All the debate, none of the hate!) but I decided that it was unlikely to have a huge impact on the long-term health of the community, so not worth paying for.
After all, I didn't want to direct a bunch of people toward a sub that was full of tumbleweeds, so when I was working on it, I just aimed for active moderation, and providing good content.
If we nip politics in the bud, it should be a lot easier to manage.  I think I came up with a pretty good manifesto and made the commenting rules/guidelines in a way that, if enforced, should minimize people getting into spats. I do believe that if you moderate tone rather than content, that can go a long way. And remember that r/Bitcoin has more than 500 times the number of users, so it will always be easier to manage a smaller community.
For now, I think the best thing we can do is just provide good content, and reply to as much as possible in a thoughtful way.

Hi there.  I use ledger as well.  Ledger has a backup process as well (involving a 24-word passphrase), so if your main concern is losing the physical usb, you are not completely screwed since you can store the backup process somewhere else.
If you have a significant amount of money in bitcoin, and you're not planning on using it regularly, I'd highly recommend storing it on your ledger usb.
Also, even if you don't want to move the money over yet, you can set up the ledger wallet in advance, make sure you're comfortable with it, and then move the btc over.

Yes, it's rather obvious you're basing this on your feelings.
Anyone with even a basic grasp of physics and/or traffic collisions will know that the two biggest factors in vehicle passenger safety are how fast the vehicles go (faster is more dangerous), and how big/heavy the vehicles are (smaller is more dangerous).
Let me break this down for you:
City buses are large.  They also travel slowly.  So the risks of accidents are much lower (no, not non-existent, but much lower).  So the cost of putting in seatbelts and requiring people to use them outweighs the benefits of mediated harm.
But I have a feeling that you won't be able to reconcile this with your "everything government is stupid" ideology, so you'll reject it without even basic critical thought.

I can't speak for others, but I met him in person last week at the meetup here in Seoul.  He's a friendly guy, and we got along really well, despite myself and the other members there being openly supportive of core's roadmap.
We talked for a while, and he actually did seem genuinely unopposed to segwit.  If we can get him from neutral to supportive (this doesn't seem implausible, since segwit isn't mutually exclusive to bigger blocks or unlimited, which seem to be his main focus), then I think we'd have a much greater shot at getting segwit activated.

@_date: 2016-12-27 10:14:17
Yeah, perhaps I am underestimating running costs.  You don't think that the extra customers would outweigh that, though?
IIRC correctly, there are a variety of existing companies that help merchants automatically transfer money from bitcoin into fiat, and I would imagine they would provide the expertise to set that up.
On the other hand, with a company as large as AirBnb, they might want to do it themselves.  This would definitely mean more initial setup and maintenance costs, but then they have more direct access, and over time, they might even be able to save on currency conversions for the times that the guest and host are operating in different currencies.  But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself now.  :D
I'm guessing that the initial setup is the main barrier.  Do you think there are significant ongoing maintenance costs that would come with accepting bitcoin?  I would imagine that hiring or training a few software engineers wouldn't be a huge deal for a company that large.  What do you think?

Keeping backups on something like google drive would be ill advised.  If you do this, you are exposing your bitcoins to anyone who gets access to your google account from any device.
Backups are best kept in safe places written on paper or something like that.  IIRC, the ledger wallet comes with a little pamphlet-like thing for you to record your backup on.


The answer is a bit more complicated than you might think.
You never store your own bitcoins.  All bitcoins are stored on the public ledger, which is public, and held in record by each of the several thousand full nodes around the world.
What you do is store the private key, which gives you permission to move (aka: spend) those coins.  The backup is a way to regenerate your private key.  You can store the backup and private key in as many places as you want, but if someone else gets access to your private key, they can free spend your coins.

Regular [dictionary of definition of democracy ]( is fine by me.
Votes do not determine rules in Bitcoin.  Participants run their nodes, and choose which rules to adhere to.  The communities that have compatible rulesets form economies.  You can run any set of rules you like even if they are different. If other people agree with you, then you and those people end up working in a separate economy.  This is what happened with LTC, BCH, etc.
No one votes on changes, and no one kicks other people out.  If you run a different ruleset, that's not other people kicking you out.  That's you failing to convince other people to follow the rules that you like.

The goal of decentralization is to prevent too much control falling into the hands of a concentrated group or groups.  To best way to avoid this is by spreading validating ability amongst as many, and as many varied, users as possible.
Having nodes concentrated in certain physical locations doesn't seem like as bad a thing to me, as long as the users of those nodes still can validate whenever they choose from wherever they are.
Now, I agree that having people own the hardware themselves would be ideal.  But I still think that having some users with nodes that are remotely operated is better than those users having no nodes at all.

Last I heard, the CIA have said that it is being investigated, they haven't found anything conclusive yet.
And [the FBI completely walked back their statements]( just after it had swung things in Trump's favor.  So, the FBI's definite statements were incorrect...*according to the FBI* two weeks later.
I have a hard time understanding why someone would think the FBI was being legit, but the CIA is being nefarious.  You want to take them both at their word?  Fine with me.  You view them both skeptically with internal agendas?  Also fine with me.  But your statement suggests some very clouded judgment, unless there's an angle I'm missing here.

Ok, it seems we agree on everything except this:


I do consider that negligible.  My goal (and I assume that goal of most bitcoiners) is world-wide mainstream adoption.  I really don't care if there's a massive backlog for several years, as long as in 5 years from now we have some badass 2nd layer making it absolutely superior to fiat.  And if we can do that with a 1mb block, even better, because it will keep decentralization as high as possible.
So, yeah, I think doubling of current capacity is negligible.  Fees being half of what they are today seems kind of irrelevant when we're talking about fees being a tiny fraction once second layer shit goes through.
Another way of thinking of it: I think of lightning network (or alternatives to it) bringing us to visa-level throughput as the 100% that we need.  Viewing it this way, doubling the current blocksize brings us from .1% to .2%.  Yeah, that seems negligible to me.
EDIT: To expand on that further, lets go with your assumption that around 20mb is when we start seeing serious drawbacks to blocksize increase.  That's 20x current size, so 20 x 3tps = 60 tps.  We need to be in the thousands.  That's why I think of it as negligible.  And it comes with a non-negligible effect on decentralization.

Buying $10 000 of bitcoin quickly and anonymously is indeed a tall order, especially from the prairies.

@_date: 2016-12-28 14:05:58


My current understanding is that a fix for transaction malleability is not absolutely necessary, but highly desirable, for 2nd layer solutions to be built upon.
So if segwit can roll out soon, I think we might soon see an emergence of these 2nd layers following after not too long.
I also see it as an investment at this point in time, but if was as skeptical as you seem to be of bitcoin's potential as an everyday currency, I'd be much less confident in it as an investment as well.  I think it's value has a good chance of going way up precisely *because* it may be used as a currency.

This is an argument for more total nodes, but it is not an argument for more decentralization.  They are not the same thing.  Decentralization is how many people run nodes *relative to the total number of users*.
5 million users with 1 million nodes is a 5:1 ratio.  100 million users with 10 million nodes is a 10:1 ratio.  The second scenario is *not* more decentralized, even though it has more nodes.
One could argue that it's a worthy trade-off, but it definitely is not more decentralization.

Exhanges are vulnerable to hacking, but if you just use them to trade, and quickly move your bitcoin to your own wallet or cold storage, you can seriously reduce your potential exposure to hacking.  This is what I do.  I load my account, trade, and then move my bitcoin to my mycelium wallet on my phone, or ledger wallet on a usb, all within a few days.  If you follow this behavior, your only risk is if the exhange gets hacked at the exact time you are using it.
Regarding anonymity...I think you'd be ok using exhanges.  As long as you don't have reason to believe that someone is already trying to track tou, you should be ok.  Once you got your bitcoin from an exchange, you can very easily move it off the exhange, and distribute it in different accounts you create without much trouble.

My question is about Nate Silver.
Of all the pollsters who should be mocked (wasn't there some group who gave Hillary 99%?), Nate Silver's 538 was the *least* confident.  And they didn't *do* the polls, they just took the polls, and aggregated them, trying to account for margin of error.  So I'd expect the more one-sided polls to take the heat, not Nate Silver, which is why it doesn't make sense to me.
Congrats on your $2000 win, btw.  Out of curiosity, in hindsight, do you view it as something that was bound to happen and you were sure of it?  Or was it more that you thought the odds were worth the betting ratio you were offered, though you thought it might have gone one way or another?

AirBnb competes against hotels, hostels and couchsurfing.  And if I would definitely go for Airbnb over someone else who didn't take bitcoin...all other things being equal.
I agree that staff would need to be trained/hired, but I doubt the other costs you mentioned are significant.
Support articles seem rather unnecessary, they're not responsible for teaching people how to use bitcoin.  As for refunds...that seems rather simple.  Just have someone submit their address, and the newly trained staff can handle that in a minute.  Seems like less of a pain than sending a refund via credit card.
What do you mean by edge cases?  What edge cases would incur more costs via bitcoin than through other payment systems?
@_date: 2016-12-19 08:00:28


I think this is not a valid concern.
A backed up mempool doesn't make it unusable, it just makes it less usable.  Or, to put it another way, it doesn't stop anyone from using it, it just reduces the number of cases where it is practical to use it.  And if this is what happens, then the back-up will reduce.  It will simply stabilize with fees being slightly higher.  Not ideal as a long-term solution, but not really a problem for the time being, IMO.


I really don't understand this "buys time" idea.  Do people believe that increasing the blocksize will make 2nd layer solutions come faster?  Or that having a full mempool will make 2nd layer devs work slower?
As far as I can tell, the absolutely worst case scenario for not increasing the blocksize is that fees stay higher for a few years.  The risks to decentralization from increasing the size seem much greater.
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:34:34
Couple of questions:
At what point do you think increased blocksize would be substantial enough to decrease the number of nodes?
I agree that doubling the size probably wouldn't be too taxing on the system in terms decentralization, but I think that its effect on the scalability problem would be negligible.  It seems likely to me that blocks would fill up again almost immediately, and fees would go down.  But temporarily paying slightly cheaper fees in exchange for a permanent increase in blockchain size, bandwidth requirement, etc, seems like a poor trade-off to me.  Maybe I'm missing something here, but it seems like its very short-term-gain (cheaper fees right now) for long-term-loss (larger network requirements, more centralization).  Especially when one considers alternative scalability solutions on the horizon.  What do you think?
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:40:00


Not even remotely accurate.
The wealth gap has existed since civilization began.  And for most of history, it was more pronounced than it is today.
If you look at human history throughout the bronze age, iron age, roman and chinese empires, medieval times, the renaissance, and the age of European exploration and colonialism...the wealth gap was way worse than it is today.

I believe that it could be somewhat mitigated with the right moderation.  But I think what's happened is that has gone too heavy-handed, and is way too hands-off.
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:58:02
Yeah, it happens to the best of us, :) and you had the odds stacked against you:
This was a shitty post/link, IMO.  The title of the article itself says Europe, and if you read it, they're not talking about taking anyone's property but rather limiting more strongly how much gold one can bring in from outside.  Just border controls.  Nothing about seizing people's property from within the state.
Then, someone decided to slap Hillary's face on the thumbnail (?) and imply this was police-state-worthy.  Somehow, this has more than a 1000 upvotes.  Man, this place is an echo-chamber sometimes.  We need more self-criticism...
@_date: 2016-12-16 05:49:54
It takes more than one person to start a divide.  I believe that theymos' policies were a bit too heavy-handed (and who knows what I would have done in his shoes?), but to say that the reaction was reasonable...that I find hard to agree with.
I think we need to move forward rather than point fingers.

Interesting, thanks for the breakdown.
I'm skeptical that he actually had so much support as people claim...didn't Hillary win the popular vote, but lost because of the electoral college?
I mean, up until a couple of weeks before the election, I was pretty convinced Hillary was a shoe-in.  But then I looked at one of the poll analyses (I think it actually was 538), and I realized that several months earlier, it had actually slated a Trump victory more likely.
And I realize how much this stuff kind of swings based on random current events.  I realized it really could go either way.  I think there's a pretty good chance that if the FBI had chosen different timing to disclose that stuff about Clinton, it might well have swing the other way.  Now it looks like Putin may have had a hand in affecting some results (this may well be false, though...still have to see if anything comes of it), so depending on the week...it really could have gone either way, IMO.
But yeah, I'll bet this:

As well intentioned as this post is, I think that the OP might want to take a closer look into the developmental status of most of those nations.
I imagine that it's not really plausible for the residents of, say...Nicaragua, Angola, or Bolivia to even acquire any bitcoin, much less use it as their main currency.
In a decade or two, I sure hope that changes.

It's nonsense. If you understand how lightning transactions work, you will realize it is impossible for it to function unless you have all amounts you are transacting tied up on the main chain.
It's just the most recent baseless criticism in a long series of goalpost movements.
First lightning was ridiculed that it was just vaporware. Then it launched.
Then they were saying it can never scale. Now it has launched and is growing steadily.
Now there is this fiat theory. I expect this one will stick around longest, because it can't be disproven. As years go on and the fears fail to materialize, they can always claim it's just around the corner.
Fortunately, the more reasonable sceptics are being convinced as the protocol develops and becomes more usable. In the end, you'll see a smaller and smaller group touting more and more outlandish theories.

I think this is overblown.  If there is a PR problem, it is because of the divide in the community over blocksize, not because of the fees itself.
Again, just increasing the blocksize to keep fees down is taking on long-term costs for a short-term benefit.

Canadian here, generally lean left (even by our standards), but have a lot in common with the "classically liberal" crowd as well.  Labels are tough.
Not libertarian at all.  I tend to have a hard time relating to the view that "banks suck".  I think that the incumbent banking system and fiat currency have worked pretty well in a lot of ways and provided our society a lot of functionality that didn't exist before.  But there are also some major fucking problems with it.
So, rather than thinking of it as "evil" or "that which needs to be destroyed", I tend to look at it and think "we can do better".  I think Bitcoin will be a huge improvement on the existing system.  The main reason is that it seems like a way to get the benefits of a shared world currency (increased trade, cooperation between nations, etc) without any of the major downsides (too much power for whatever authority would control it if it were centralized).  Indeed, I have a hard time imagining the emergence of a truly global currency that isn't decentralized.
There are almost certainly a lot of other good reasons to like Bitcoin, but that's the positive angle that I'm most confident about.
I don't think governments are by definition evil, and I don't think Bitcoin will bring them down.  I am rather confident that governments will be able to surviving by shifting their tax structure around, and that reliance on debt isn't a prerequisite for a modern state.  That said, I think Bitcoin will also have the benefit of protecting populations from the more predatory forms of inflation, (Venezuela and Zimbabwe being the foremost examples).
I'm not knowledgeable enough about economics to know for sure whether or not a small amount of inflation can be a good thing overall, and I find most arguments in the whole deflation vs mild inflation to be oversimplistic.  I don't think we'll truly know until we see what unfolds.
I don't think that Bitcoin's appeal is constrained by someone's political stance, so I don't think that 3) even requires an answer.  Bitcoin will go mainstream as we solve scalability and the user experience, regardless of whether or not enough people hate the banks, IMO.  (I think Fungibility is also really important for several reasons, but not quite as crucial for adoption.)
Don't have any books or articles to read on it, but if I can recommend anything to my fellow Bitcoiners, it's to be a bit more humble in your political leanings.  Most of the topics surrounding these issues are extremely complex, but a lot of people seem disproportionately confident due to extremely simple reasons.  I think we'd all be better off if we approached these topics with an air of "well, I *think* X is pretty likely to be true", instead of the usual "you're an idiot if you don't know X!"
EDIT: Also, if you're a libertarian who's reading this, and is frustrated that I'm not also a libertarian - relax!  I'm still dedicating my career to helping Bitcoin to take over, so we can still be on the same team.  No need to get wound up that I'm dirty statist if we're cooperating anyway ;)

Ah, didn't realize that...I actually didn't realize that the FBI had anything to do with that...so I gave it a quick google and got this:
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:42:16
Short answer: More miners are using more computing power to do mining.  This makes the network more secure, but also makes mining more competitive.
Long answer:
Every 2016 blocks (which is roughly every two weeks), the difficulty is adjusted.  An average block takes about 10 minutes to mine (2016 * 10m = two weeks).  If the total computing power mining increases, then blocks will be mined at a slightly faster rate.  The adjustment takes into account how quickly the blocks were mined, and if it was faster than expected, then it increases the difficulty to match the new computing power.
For users, this is in general considered to be a good thing.  It won't affect you directly as a user, but it does mean that the network is more and more secure against a hostile attack.
For miners, this means that it is becoming more and more competitive, so they need to continually increase their computing power to keep their profits level.
I hope that helps.
@_date: 2016-12-16 05:46:58
Yeah, I was thinking this.  If there is indeed outside intervention trying to divide the community into two camps, then it almost certainly is happening on both ends.

Roger Ver owns or wields considerable influence over several online discussion communities and a larger chunk of mining power.  I believe it would be pragmatic to engage him for support of segwit.

There are a few reasons someone might prefer this option to an on-chain tx:
- the sender might only be able to spend via LN
- you might want to receive directly into your LN channel so that you can directly spend it from there later on
- cheaper fees
- you don't run the risk of the tx getting stuck for hours or days if it was low-fee and traffic spikes
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:42:13
Not necessarily.  There are other factors to take into account, such as how much will be mined/created in the future, and how long the currency has been in existence.

Let's imagine a hypothetical scenario:
Assume that the government mandates that someone could now trade millidollars, meaning 1/10th of a cent, and banks support this feature.  The rate of new money printed doesn't change, and no one is handed any more money.  The only difference is that prices start to be listed to 3 decimal places instead of 2, and your debit/credit card calculates and pays down to 3 decimal places, and all points of sale accept this now.
Would you consider this to be inflation?

Anyway, I think I've found it:


*If* the network were to increase the number of satoshis in existence, then I would agree with you.
This is not, however, what the rest of us are talking about.
The proposal is *not* to create more satoshis, but rather to *make each satoshi become more divisible*.  This already exists in the lightning network, where they operate in units of millisatoshi.
I do not believe this would result in inflation, because it seems analogous to the situation I described in my comment above.

Number one rule is to keep access to your 24-word mnemonic. As long as you keep it safe and secret (that is - you know what it is, and no one else does), then you should be able to eventually recover your funds. This isn't going to be news to anyone who's used a non-custodial wallet before, but it bears repeating.
The second thing to watch out for is losing access to your 2FA method(s). Now, as long as you have corrected handled your mnemonic, a lost 2FA won't leave your funds permanently lost, but it may be a hassle and require a lot of waiting. If you lose access to all your 2FA methods, then your funds will remain unmovable until your nlocktime transactions expire so you can use our recovery tool (default waiting period is one year since your wallet's last transaction, but this is adjustable for the user), or until you can use our 2FA reset procedure, which has a minimum 1-year waiting period.
We *strongly* urge our users to create *at least* two different 2FA methods, so that in the event that one of them gets lost, the user can reset it without issue.
TLDR: Keep your mnemonic safe and secure, and use at least 2 different 2FA methods, and it will always be easy to recover your funds, even if you lose your device, forget your PIN, your computer gets wiped, etc.

It's worth highlighting that much of that information (mobile phone number, mobile PIN code) is optional, and not at all required to use the wallet and its full set of features. Create a new email address, connect over tor, don't use mobile for 2FA, etc, and you'll be able to really minimize the amount of information we can see.

I could start a fractional reserve bitcoin bank today if I wanted to.
All I have to do is let people make deposits in bitcoin, and start loaning out a percentage of those deposits.  As long as I keep my promised fraction of deposits in bitcoin, and people trust me enough to make deposits, I've got a fractional reserve bank up and running.

For less technical users, unfortunately, this option isn't available in the GUI version of the wallet.
If it's to claim airdrops or forks, we make it clear that users need to move their coins before the fork/snapshot date. Even so, there have been some tools created by users to claim some forks (such as for the BCH split).
For another use, such as generating more receiving address without needing to log in to the wallet, our permanent payment URL feature can provide this convenience. It's a URL that you can give to anyone that will provide a fresh receiving address for your wallet. Keep in mind that this is a departure from our usual trust model since it does require the user to trust that we are generating the correct addresses server-side. But it is there as an option if someone considers the convenience worth the tradeoff.
Right now to view your permanent payment URL, you'll need to log in to the greenaddress desktop version, and view it from "receive" and "show advanced options".

A bit different than paynyms. Here's an example (if you want to send me some testnet bitcoins):
As for the last part of your comment, we do intend to eventually add generic multisig support that should allow for the use-case you're describing, though that's not something will be adding in the short-term.
While it's not exactly what you're asking about, one thing you can already do is add a 2of3 subaccount. This lets you have 2 keys for yourself, and one key stored by our server. You use this account as you would with your default wallet, but the advantage here is that if you ever lose your 2FA methods, or if our servers ever become inaccessible for any reason, there is no waiting period if you want to use our garecovery tool - because you have two of the keys required, you don't need to wait for any presigned timelock transactions to be ready.

It might take a few weeks or months for this to get added. I didn't mean "soon" as in the next update, sorry if that was unclear.
One of the reasons is that there are still many services that cannot send to bech32 addresses yet, so we will be making the shift over as more and more of ecosystem becomes compatible.
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:52:01


When we warn against using an address more than once, it is about having more than one transaction sent to that address, so I believe your proposed use-case would be considered "address reuse". The reason is that having multiple transactions sending funds to the same address makes chain analysis easier. It allows companies who try to track user's bitcoin usage to more easily group transactions and estimate how much you have in your wallet. It weakens not only your own privacy, but can also be a privacy risk to the sender, and to a lesser extent, the bitcoin network as a whole.
Also, depending on how cryptography develops in the coming decades, it is possible that spending multiple times from the same address (which might happen if all of our payments to your son's piggy bank are claimed at different times) might eventually allow an attacker to gain information about our private key.
That being said, it is entirely possible to do as you plan to. Many people do reuse addresses in the ecosystem, and our wallet's addresses can fill this role as good as any other. We just recommend against it (whether it's using our wallet, or any other service's).

As pointed out, you really want to avoid reusing an address.
One thing you can do is use our permanent payment URL feature, and put it one a QR code that you stick to the side of the piggy bank.
It's a URL that you can give to anyone that will provide a fresh receiving address for your wallet. Keep in mind that this is a departure from our usual trust model since it does require the user to trust that we are generating the correct addresses server-side. But it is there as an option if someone considers the convenience worth the tradeoff.

Miners are rewarded by both newly created bitcoins (aka block subsidy) and from fees from transactions included in blocks. Presently, the vast majority of this reward is from the subsidy. Over time, total transaction fees on the network must increase (presumably by more and more people using bitcoin) in order to compensate for a declining subsidy.
It is still unclear whether or not bitcoin's mining incentive structure can remain intact from tx fees alone, but it seems we mightn't find out for several decades still.

@_date: 2016-09-24 17:49:09


Agreed.  But I believe that you're subtracting lost coins from the wrong part of that fraction.
If coins are lost gradually over time, then they are essentially coins exiting circulation.  So, that means the effective number of coins entering circulation is less because, those 'lost coins' are subtracted from the number of new coins issued via mining.
This *reduces* the effective monetary inflation rate.

Hi I think you have a slightly oversimplified understanding of how channel states are updated.
At the end of each state update (that is, each lightning transaction), each party will hold their own version of a commitment transaction that allows them to unilaterally close the channel *by broadcasting that commitment transaction* (a transaction must be broadcasted and confirmed for the channel to close).  Let's assume that A wants to close the channel without discussing with B first.
If A broadcast's her copy of the commitment transaction, B's funds will become immediately spendable by B, but A's funds will have a slightly more restrictive output: after a certain number of blocks, A can spend her funds OR B can immediately spend all of A's funds *if and only if* B knows the revocation key (known by A).
If B doesn't know the revocation key, that's OK.  A just needs to wait for a while, and then the channel is closed.
Now, if A sends some bitcoins to B, the channel state gets updated.  This will (among other things) involve A revealing the revocation key from the previous commitment transaction to B.  What this means, is that if A tries to cheat by broadcasting the previous state of the channel, then B will be able to steal all of A's funds, since B knows the revocation key of the previous transaction.
I don't know if I explained that comprehensibly or not, so let me know if I need to clarify any of it and I'll get back to you.
@_date: 2016-09-27 08:44:52
Wow, interesting read.  I'd never thought of it this way.  There must have been waayyyy more lost back when it wasn't worth as much.
I guess you're probably right, the current rate of effective monetary inflation is almost certainly much higher than calculated from the actual total.  But I suppose that's probably a good thing for bitcoin's value.  If the price manages to stay somewhat stable at higher inflation, then it stands to reason that it will have a higher chance of gaining value as the slowdown of inflation will be greater.

If you're trying to send money to a wallet, you get the receiving address, and you have the sender send the funds to that address.
Different cryptocurrencies generally use different address formats, so their protocol should reject address formats from other coins.  But sometimes software is poorly built, and a lot of these altcoins are really shoddy pieces of work.
And then you have the forks of Bitcoin, like BCH, that use the same address format.  In this case, the transaction goes through, but if your wallet is BTC-only, then it won't see the transaction, because it doesn't pay attention to the BCH network.
If you send BCH to a non-segwit address, the format will still be valid, so there is a chance of getting your coins back, if you can get the private key from your wallet, and use it with a BCH-compatible wallet.  But if you send BCH to a BTC segwit address format, you can kiss your funds goodbye.  The BCH network treats segwit addresses as "anyone-can-spend".  This means that after you send BCH to a segwit address, BCH miners see it as free money you left on the ground and can claim it for themselves.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:27:07
Last year, a fraction of the Bitcoin community, dissatisfied with the direction that Bitcoin development was taking, decided to fork the code and run their own version.  They dubbed it "Bitcoin Cash".
The more widely used version, and the one supported by most members of this r/Bitcoin uses the ticker "BTC". 
 The one that forked away last summer and is more widely supported in r/btc is "BCH".
The clearest way to distinguish the two without angering anyone is to refer to them by their respective tickers (BTC and BCH) so that's what I'll do from now on.
There has since been a kind of war of words over the brand.  Those of us who continue to use BTC just call it Bitcoin.  We feel there is no need to change the name, and it appears as though the majority of businesses, developers, and users agree.
Those who use BCH believe that their version is more true to the original vision/purpose of the coin, and believe that they lay claim to the name "Bitcoin".  While many accept that they must at least say "Bitcoin Cash" to avoid confusion, you will often see claims that "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" or "I use Bitcoin (BCH)", as an attempt to solidify their legitimacy.
Those who were opposed to the ethos surrounding BCH take issue with their claims to be "Bitcoin", and believe that they should be treated like any other altcoin.  As such, they often refer to them as "bcash".  BCH proponents strongly dislike this name.  In response, many have tried to come up with a denigrating name for BTC, and have called it Bitcoin Core, or Bcore.  There are some other more colorful names that haven't really caught on, but you get the idea.
If I had to guess, the vast majority of people just refer to them by the names Bitcoin (for BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (for BCH).  Any other names that are used tend to be signals of allegiance or support one way or another, or are at least interpreted that way.  So yeah, you'll see people making big deals out of them, like here.

So, if I'm understanding you correctly, you are thinking of lost coins more as a big number of them that have already been lost, whereas I've been thinking of them as something that will gradually be lost over time.

I have yet to heard of a non blockchain+PoW system that has been shown to achieve decentralized consensus.

I also hear a lot of support for PoS, but again, I'll believe it when I see it.
What do you have in mind?

I agree that monero is pretty cool (probably my favorite alt-coin), but my understanding is that it scales far, far worse than bitcoin does.
EDIT: The point I'm getting at is that I can't think of a single alt-coin that can scale as well as Bitcoin AND retain its level of decentralization.  There are plenty of examples that can do one or the other, but I don't know of any that is a serious competitor for doing both.

I'm not sure it makes sense to frame Ethereum and Bitcoin as either being or becoming an "improved" version of the other.
They aim to solve very different problems.  Bitcoin aims to be decentralized and inflation-proof system of value transfer.  That's it.  (There are other priorities, such as fungibility, but these are all just extensions of the goal of sound money.)
Ethereum is attempting to tackle a much different problem, that is, to be a decentralized world computer that can run processes that require Turing-completeness.
I don't believe that Bitcoin will ever attempt to match Ethereum in trying to do so.  But that means that Bitcoin can be much more secure and efficient at value transfer.
As for this:


I don't think so, nor do I think that would be desirable.  Those "innovations" have yet to produce a single proven use-case, as far as I know.  It seems pretty likely at this point that Ethereum's value is as a platform to launch ponzis through other ICOs.  If and when the ICO bubble pops, Ethereum is likely going down with it.  I think Bitcoin is better off just being the best money it can be instead of getting involved in all that.

Hello, I'm one of the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup guys.


I can agree with a lot in this statement, but I think that it's more compatible with community statements like this than you might initially think.
To be clear, this letter wasn't a vote.  This was a statement on behalf of our users, but written and published by the organizers.  We did reach out beforehand to offer our membership the opportunity to chance express support for segwit2x, but it was virtually non-existent, so we felt comfortable going ahead with our statement.  Since the statement, we have also only received supportive comments from our membership.
As for the organizers, there are 5 of us.  Three are professional software developers, and the other two have been coding as a hobby for some years now.  We also spend a considerable amount of time every week reading and discussing economics and game theory because, as you indicate, they are highly relevant to Bitcoin.  I am confident that any one of us would be able to comprehensively defend any of the positions we publicize.
Another reason why this statement (and others like it) are important is because community groups like ours are a significant path for onboarding new users.  We get many attendees who are looking to get into Bitcoin, and use us as one of their first resource.  This puts us in a position of considerable influence, and thus, considerable responsibility.  We believe that it is important for businesses (such as those in the NYA) to know where we stand on this issues, since we often direct users to or away from particular services.
In particular, I hope that Korbit changes its tone, because I've personally really enjoyed their service, and I would love to be to continue referring new users to them.  Their current support for a contentious hard-fork makes this difficult to do.

This seems to be mainly caused by variance - F2pool's share of blocks mined for the last 24 hours (16%) is double what it is for the past week (8%).  Looks like Slush also had a slightly better run.
It does appear that there are a couple of new entries not signalling NYA, those are only 2 recent blocks (coinbase text refers to Bitcoin India for one, and Bitcoin Russia for another).  But that's still pretty insignificant compared to F2pool's jump in blocks found.

I do believe that Korbit is a DCG comapny.  They were recently bought out by a gaming company called Nexen, so I'm not sure if that's still true.
I don't know much about Coinone.  Bithumb seems to have a suspiciously high trade volume, especially after the crackdown in China, if my memory serves me right.  They also seem to be willing to list almost any alt-coin under the sun.
Still I don't think any of that is good evidence that Jihan has his fingers in any pies here, and I haven't heard anything to that regard.
We're really just a few guys who run the meetup, and we're not heavily intertwined with Korean businesses, so take all this with a grain of salt.

This is not what happened.  We asked people what they thought through *several different media* **before and after** we made the statement.
We did conduct a survey via our text chatroom, and it overwhelmingly confirmed our sentiment.  Unfortunately, however, it had a rather low response rate, so it wouldn't have made sense to use it as a source.

I agree with the second half but not the first half.
I agree that it expecting more 'free' airdrops from future forks has probably helped BTC's value.
I don't think that necessarily makes BTC UTXO's less fungible, as long as it is possible to split coins.
Unless I'm misunderstanding your suggestion, it seems to be based on the assumption that there is a single UTXO that can be used twice.  I don't believe this is completely accurate.
A UTXO can be spent on one chain, but not on the other.  Because of this, I think that it makes more sense to say that there are *two different UTXOs* after a split occurs.  You would need to separately check each UTXO on each blockchain.
So, now, I don't believe that will affect fungibility.  But yes, it might be a factor in Bitcoin's current price increase.

Hi, one of the statement's authors here.  Thanks for the feedback, u/cointwerp!
I strongly agree with your sentiment, and believe me, I had a queasy feeling when I initially wrote down the word "legacy".
In the end, though, communicating our point as *clearly* as possible was the top priority, and we needed some way to identify the "chain-that-is-not-segwit2x".
We're not going to start referring to it as legacy Bitcoin in everyday conversation, but in the context, it seemed like the right move.  After all, I don't think anyone reading the letter will make the mistake of thinking we're legitimatizing the alternative fork.

Multisig is a type of smart contract that is already enabled on bitcoin.
If you are asking if this will enable Turing completeness and the smart contracts that come with that, then no, it will not enable this.
As far as I understand, what this can do is let a smart contract exist where there are several different options to redeem a script, but none are revealed, except the one that is eventually used to redeem it.  I believe the advantages here would be more privacy and more efficient implementations of smart contracts (that is, smaller TX sizes).
There are probably other functions of this that I am unaware of at present.

7 comments and only one vaguely helpful.  Come on guys, we all fuck up sometimes.  No need to be dicks about it.
Same thing happened a while back when I was moving some funds with a couple of friends.
u/shortfu, your BCH is currently owned by Bittrex, because the private key that controls the BTC address will be the same private key for controlling the BCH.  Basically, you have to ask Bittrex to give you the money back.
It's a tough situation, because they don't really have to, but it's probably in their interests to help you out.
Find the TXID, and the receiving address, and provide that in a link when you contact their support.  Explain to them what happened, and VERY POLITELY ask if there is any way you could recover the funds, or at least a portion of them.
I did the same thing with Korbit when we accidentally sent BCH there.  It took them 2 months, and they charged 10% processing fee (fair enough, it's probably a pain in the ass for them to do this), but I was eventually credited with 90% of the mistakenly sent funds.
Bittrex might tell you "fuck off, we're keeping your money because you screwed up", but I think that'd be pretty poor form from a customer satisfaction perspective.
Let us know how it goes, and good luck!

There are a couple of reasons.
Some people get paid in Bitcoin, so naturally, they're going to need to sell/spend in order to pay for basic expenses.
There's also the fact that people aren't perfectly rational or patient.  Nor is it guaranteed that Bitcoin will continually increase in value.  Even if you strongly believe that the final destination is moon, we might see a lot of dips and valleys between now and then.
On a last point, there's the fact that people can already choose not to spend their money, and make interest off of investments.  If you live in a developed country, investing in a index fund is a pretty reliable way to make steady gains from your savings.  And yet, most people do not save most of their money.
People who do invest wisely and are super frugal can actually achieve some pretty cool things.  The blog [MrMoneyMoustache]( is a pretty cool example.  The guy was really into safe/non-risky investing, and a super frugal lifestyle which allowed him to retire ridiculously early.

Technically it's still undergoing inflation at the moment as blocks are mined, but it can be argued that this can be discounted since it is at a (mostly) predictable rate, so it can be priced in.
As new bitcoin creation slows to a halt, deflation will naturally occur over time as keys are lost due to human error, are purposely burned, etc.
To be honest, I find the image in OP kind of misleading, because it's not due to inflation that bitcoin's price has increased so much, but rather because of expanding usage, but oh well.

@_date: 2017-10-12 03:40:49


There are two main centralization concerns: full nodes, and mining.
To run a node, you need:
- storage space for the blockchain
- bandwidth to receive and propagate transactions, blocks, messages and other things
- RAM to store the UTXO set
- CPU power to validate incoming transactions and blocks
By doubling blocksize, it immediately doubles the bandwidth and CPU requirements (both of which are a bottleneck at the moment).  Storage and RAM requirements are perpetually growing, and doubling the blocksize will make them grow twice as fast.
So this means that we'll see a lot less people be unable to afford the cost of running their own node.  This means that more and more people need to rely on/trust third parties to check the blockchain for them.
Now for mining centralization.  As you may or may not know, most Bitcoin mining happens in China at the moment, and a large (greater than 35%) of the mining pools are controlled by a single company.  This is a very precarious position.  Luckily, it has been improving for the past few years, but we still need to do better.
Bigger blocks make it harder for new players, and especially geographically far-flung people, to compete with mining.  The bigger your blocks are, the longer it takes to propagate them through the network.  So, if a big pool creates a blocks, and it takes 1 second(*) to reach you, then you will be wasting 1 second mining an old block, and the big pool will have a head start on the next block.
This increases centralization pressure.
(*)not a representative number, just an illustrative example


A couple things to unpack here.
Firstly, remember that "core" specifically isn't under attack.  "Core" is just a client, and sometimes a way that we refer to a very loose collection of developers who contribute to the project.
Now, for those of us who support the rules according to the bitcoin core client, and don't want to see bigger blocks forced upon us by some miners and businesses, yes, we might consider segwit2x as an attack.
I happen to believe that the segwit2x movement will fail, partly because the network is sufficiently decentralized enough at the moment.  Individuals like myself can run our own nodes, and continue to choose which network rules we support without having to rely on a business making that decision for us.
There are more reasons as well, but I don't want to write you an entire novel here.  Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything.  :-)
I think it's important to remember that despite what you may here, those of us support core always want to be able to use Bitcoin more cheaply and easily.  We just don't believe that blocksize increases are the best way to do it.  There are other options that we would prefer to pursue that don't endanger the network.

1) &amp; 2) this entirely depends on how your software implements in (if any).  So far Ledger has committed to supporting both chains, and I expect they will released detailed instructions when it happens.  If you are using other software, I suggest you contact them directly.
3) This question isn't clear.  Could you try rephrasing it in a more detailed way?
4) Using this address will create a whole bunch of useless UTXOs.  Knowing the private key will allow the UTXOs to be 'swept up' so that they don't bloat the UTXO set up so much, (though it will still waste space in the blockchain).
5) You don't need to send any amount to that address.  I believe that you can 'send' 0 to that address, and it will still succeed at replay protection.

@_date: 2017-10-12 03:23:56
Have you looked into the reasons for opposing segwit2x and other similar blocksize increases?
There are several different metrics by which it could increase centralization of both mining and full nodes.  The more centralized the network is, the more vulnerable it is to attack from outside forces, the more it can be influence by external (government) entities, etc.
So yes, increasing the blocksize would give you temporarily lower fees and faster confirmation.  It would also undermine the actual value proposition of Bitcoin, since the entire reason it is valuable is because it is decentralized.
I hope you don't mind me being blunt, but even if you want lower fees for your business, it is extremely short-sighted to call for bigger blocks without seriously considering the long-term impact on the network.

Covert ASICBOOST is not possible in blocks that include transactions that spend Segwit UTXO's.
To phrase it more simply (but less precisely): Segwit = No more covert ASICBOOST
Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, uses the same PoW algorithm, but does not use Segwit, so covert ASICBOOST is still fully usable there.

Ledger has just added that stuff in preparation, you won't be able to split it until after the fork happens.  Even then, it may take some time before Ledger's software is replay-protection ready, so after the fork happens, keep your eyes out for any statement from ledger.
Once you can split the coins, you can send your B2X to an exchange to sell (once the exchanges are receiving and trading the new coin), or yes, Shapeshift will probably allow you to convert your B2X into BTC (but again, this may take some time, don't expect it immediately).

Multisig counts as a type of smart contract in this context.  By extension, this would apply to the various scripts required to implement bi-directional channels for lightning network, such as their Hashed Time-Lock Contracts, which are rather important.
So, (unless I'm misunderstanding something, which is entirely possible) we basically get much more efficient payment channels, and improved fungibility on those channels.
Both this and Schnorr should allow for greater scaling when it comes to 2nd layers being built on top of the base blockchain.
EDIT: To give an example of how multisig benefits:
Let's say you have a 3of5 multisig for some output.  With MAST, all the blockchain needs to store for the time being is a hash, so no one outside of the creator(s) need know what the conditions are.  Once the three signatures are used to redeem the UTXO, all that's revealed is that the 3 signatures are enough to redeem it, so the outside world doesn't even know that it was a 3of5...just a 3ofN.  This saves space in transactions, and improves privacy.

What if bulletproofs are optional, but there is a strong enough incentive to use them that we don't need to worry about people choosing not to?  Segwit was soft-forked in, and it incentivizes people to use it. It seems likely that as time goes on, a greater and greater share of transactions will be Segwit, since it's cheaper.
Also...why can't we soft-fork in a mandatory change?  I'm pretty sure that disallowing a previous type of transaction is a tightening of rules, which is a soft-fork.  I'm not entirely sure it would be a desirable way to go about things...but it definitely seems possible.

The genesis block promotes (I'll stand by that word) a particular article which described a decision by a state.  I don't think it was ideal, but at least it was general criticism of the system - not a promotion of certain elements within it.
If Satoshi had directed people toward a particular politician's social media, I think thought would have been quite problematic, don't you think?




Sure.  The material got posted and upvoted, and that's fine.  I don't agree with the speech myself, but I don't have a huge issue with it being on Bitcoin's front page.  Especially since it was done through user voting, not by mod action.  And the speech itself isn't a promotion of the political party.  The guys twitter feed, OTOH...


I'm taken aback that you'd bring that up as similar.  You really think that politicians are comparable to Bitcoin developers on a Bitcoin subreddit?

Yeah, I admit my experience is totally anecdotal, and most libertarians will, as you say, claim that the frustration is directed at the subsidy, not the tech.

Segwit has a timeout for November 15 this year. If it isn't locked in by then, it expires. It can be renewed, of course, but then 148's method of activating won't work.
Because of this, the 148 chain needs to get at least ~13% of the hash rate in order to find 2 weeks worth of blocks before November 15.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:00:26
Mining, of course, will need to stay centralized on earth (if it isn't clear to someone, let me know and I'll break it down).
For on-scale transactions, you just have to decide how long you are willing to wait for confirmations.
When broadcasting a transaction, there are three factors that affect how long you will have to wait:
(1) How long it takes for your transaction to reach the  network and miners.
(2) How long it takes to be included in a block.
(3) How long it takes for you to know about the block.
On earth, (1) and (3) are negligible, so practically speaking, we really only need to worry about (2), which should be approximately 5 minutes, on average.
One we start operating on an interplanetary scale, however, (1) and (3) starting increasing really fast.
The moon wouldn't be too much of an issue, since it's only about 1.3 light-seconds away (meaning it takes 1.3 seconds for a message to be sent or received) , so you'd only be adding 2.6 seconds to the whole process.  Probably a deal-breaker for mining, but not much of an issue for regular transactions.
Mars will probably be the first place where there is a permanent human settlement outside of earth.  The distance between Mars and Earth varies between 3 and 22 light-minutes.  This means that, at best, you'd have to wait an extra 6 minutes for your first confirmation.  At other times of the year, you'd be waiting another 44 minutes, plus however long (c) is.
All of this, by the way, assumes that bandwidth isn't an issue.  And for a long time, we can probably assume it will be.
Now, keep in mind that that is all about on-chain transactions only.  When it comes to 2nd layers, that opens up a lot more doors.  As I understand it, a lightning network could operate on Mars or other inner solar system planets at nearly the same functionality as here on earth.

Do you remember the transaction ID? I'd love to use it as a reference if possible. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:51:37
Sure, but in that case, we can assume that the btc used in your example are worth a whole lot more in real-world value than they are today, right?
If that's the case, we can assume that these channels already allow people to make some pretty large transactions, which addresses the issue that raised.
Unless I'm misunderstanding something.
PS: Thanks for making this simulation, great work!
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:38:40
The percentage can be a bit of a misleading metric.
They technically need 269 of 336 blocks signalling it within certain periods in order to lock in.
If they get 269 or more, it locks in.  If not, it starts counting again from the next period.
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:50:37

I agree with the rest of your point, and I also agree that wealth inequality is a bit of a problem.  However, I don't believe this is accurate:


In the last few hundred years?  Sure!
But there were certainly times in the past when wealth was even more unequally balanced.  The first examples that come to mind are ancient Egypt, when the Pharoah and his/her family technically owned the entire country.  In the last Roman republic, you also had senators personally owning ridiculously large chunks of the Roman economy.

It is a technique that allows someone to cut a corner when calculating bitcoin's POV algorithm. Some would call it a cheat, others would call or an optimization. [Here's a technical explanation]( . 
The result is a boost in mining power by whichever companies possess the ability to use the technique. Also, certain updates to the network would make this technique less usable. So there becomes an incentive for users of asicboost to oppose updates, not based on what is good for the network, but on what is good for their own personal intetests.
Many of us are concerned about this because we consider it to be a misalignment of incentives that is harmful for bitcoin's development. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:37:38


Right.  But people will figure that out, won't they?  I mean, if LN takes off and starts become really useful, I know that I'd be willing to purposely open up a channel with a large starting amount (preferably at a time when I needed to make a rather large purchase and have the opportunity to do it via LN).  Then, if I make sure that I receive payments (say, from an exchange, or if my employer is willing to send some/all of my paycheque there), I can continually use that channel for a lot of things.

Cash is regulated.  Just because something cannot be perfectly enforced, it doesn't mean it will exist completely outside of the regulatory sphere.
Take a restaurant that wants to accept bitcoin.  They're going to want to make that visible (or, what's the point?).  That'll be kind of hard to hide if there is any kind of investigation into them.  So if there is some kind of regulation regarding bitcoin, it would likely make sense for them to go along with it (assuming it's not cripplingly onerous, of course).
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:15:28


Yes.  The coinbase string on its own actually does nothing except signal intent, though the recent uptick in blocks signalling BIP91 is more concrete sign that they will go through with it.


Slush pool was not part of the NYA.  Slush pool also allows their own users to determine what bits to signal.  I do not know if they plan to support the segwit2x software, but I imagine that they would want a bit more time to review it for safety before they make that option available to their users.  It was, after all, just released, and has had shockingly minimal testing.


In general, they do, as far as I can tell.  I believe that their  priority is to let users of their pool signal whatever support they want (as long as it is technically feasible for them to do this).
When they do voice their opinions, they do tend to be one of the most pro-core pools.  And so it makes complete sense that they would withhold support of the NYA/segwit2x.  In general, the core developers are pretty damn opposed to segwit2x, [as can be seen here](
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:51:13
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:52:14
To my knowledge, BIP91(bit 4) and btc1 blocks are indistinguishable at the moment - they just signal bit 4.
Core nodes won't reject blocks just for signalling bit 4.  But they will automatically follow the longest chain.  Once BIP91/sw2x is activated, the btc1 miners will reject non segwit blocks, but the core nodes won't, so there is a decent chance that they will disagree with which one is the longest valid chain.
If the btc1 miners are well connected, this won't be a problem, because they will have more than half of the hashpower, so theirs will consistently be considered the longest chain.  But if they are not well connected, they won't be able to build off of each others blocks, so they'll just be building a bunch of smaller chains, which will get ignored by core nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:10:34
There are several potential chain splits that might happen.  The two most imminent ones could be caused by 148 (triggered August 1st) and Bitmain's hard fork reaction to it (which would come after 148 if it happens).
If segwit2x goes smoothly for the next week, then these two scenarios should not happen.  148 will not split off because segwit signally should be 100%.  And therefore bitmain's fork should not happen because they claim it would be in response to 148.
This only means that the most likely chain split scenarios for *this summer* are unlikely to occur, but there are several other hard forks and chain split scenarios that might arise later on this year.  The most significant/likely one being segwit2x itself, which plans to implement a hard fork 3 months after segwit rolls out.  If things proceed on schedule, this would be slated for sometime in November.
I hope that helps.
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:42:17
What do you think is more likely:
(a) You are mistaken
(b) Greg, Matt, *and* all of the btc1 devs replying on that thread don't understand miner connectivity as well as you?

@_date: 2017-05-29 15:56:47
How is this any different than cash?
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:30:32
The problem is that if the btc1 miners are not directly connected to each other, they rely on the network of non-mining nodes to relay their blocks to one another.
The vast majority of non-mining nodes are *not* running segwit2x, so they cannot be relied on to relay blocks from the segwit2x miners to the other segwit2x miners (because they might not recognize them as being part of the longest chain).
And if the segwit2x miners can't see each others' blocks, they will all basically end up mining their own individual chain.

They can absolutely regulate certain aspects of it.  In particular, the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:53:32
It's possible that the renewable energy angle might also be triggering some anger. There are a lot of libertarians here, and while they're not all like this, there is a significant chunk of them who associate solar energy with subsidies, and get irked at any indication that it might be a viable and useful tech.
EDIT: On further thought, I'll admit this is unlikely to the main source.  I was just spitballing.

It's not just for exchanges, though. Users can directly send funds to each other using the liquid client (and we'll soon have support for an easy-to-use mobile wallet). And as more exchanges integrate (as Bitfinex and The Rock Trading already have), then users will be able to deposit and withdraw from those exchanges within 2 minutes.
And that's really only the beginning. There's a lot more it offers with issued assets, confidential transactions/assets, atomic swaps, etc. It's an entire platform as well.

btc.com is indeed owned by Bitmain.  They (btc.com) had a representative visit our meetup here in Seoul last month, and they confirmed as much (and on top of that, the company swag/business cards/bags all referenced Bitmain).
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:56:15
...that seems like a rather extreme reaction...did I say something insulting?
My comments are based on several things:
- Our local meetup has seen increased interest and participation in the past months.
- I have had more people in my personal life talking about it and asking me about it (though I acknowledge this is anecdotal).
- Korea ordinarily had premiums on bitcoin and other cryptos, but these have fluctuated wildly in the previous weeks, partly due to the huge spike in traffic.  This indicates increased demand.
- There has been a notable increase in media coverage recently.
- And most importantly: there has been a huge spike in traffic in trading on the local exchanges recently (they are Korbit, Coinone, and Bitthumb if you're interested).  For a period of time, Korea actually had the highest traffic worldwide for ETH trading.
Certainly not everyone is streaming into the streets, and I made no such claim.  But I can promise that about half of the locals in my age group (20's-30's) that I talk to have at least heard of it, and many are looking to trade.

Ok, so if I'm understanding you correctly, you weren't intending to just point out that they can often hardfork.  Rather you were emphasizing the fact that they have a regular schedule established to make coordination easier.  Have I got that right?
That's worth thinking about, thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:45:48
Thanks for elaborating.  But I'm not sure I quite understand you here:


I agree that, technically speaking, it's entirely possible.  But doesn't it stand to reason that with a much larger community, one is more likely to encounter disparate views and make coordination more difficult?
Maybe you're suggesting that Core should take a stronger leadership role?
This might seem appealing, but wouldn't this run counter to certain decentralization ideals that many in the community highly value?
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:14:50
If people continue finding "cheats", then yes, it would be a big problem.
I would say this is rather unlikely, though, because the current issue isn't a problem with the proof-of-work algorithm itself (it uses SHA-256) but with how the blocker header is put together before it gets fed into the algorithm.
Essentially, this was an error in how bitcoin was designed originally, and could be fixed by a future hardfork if it continues to be problematic.  In the meantime, segwit will be able to address the current issue.

There's another angle here - Bitmain may be slowly accepting the fact that segwit is going through, but are looking for a way out that saves face and allows them some degree of plausible deniability re: ASICBOOST.
This might be it.  If segwit goes through, and then the 2x part flops, they can claim that they did support segwit, they were the good guys because they compromised, and that all they really wanted was larger blocks, etc.
I have no idea what's actually happening here (Christ it's getting complicated), but that is a possible motivation for supporting a hard-fork even if they don't think it's likely to succeed.
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:14:30
Yeah, I definitely don't think it would be wise do a PoW change just to avoid the hardfork here (assuming the code isn't completely atrocious, of course).
I think our difference in opinions has to do with the integrity of miners.  I'm assuming that you trust Bitmain's statement on ASICBOOST was completely honest?
My (hopeful) thought is that it was the main reason for stalling segwit, and that Jihan has realized he can't hold it at bay forever, and this is just a way for him to allow segwit through without losing face.
I kind of doubt that 2x is really a priority for most miners.  I mean, it could be for bitmain and the other big players, since it will place centralization pressure on mining, benefiting them the most.
But in the end, I really don't know what's going to happen.  What I really hope for is segwit rolling out by the end of the summer, and that the 2x part fails to materialize.  But if the hardfork does happen smoothly, I'd still call it a good year.
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:27:17


I'm not saying you need to care.  I'm just bringing it up as a possible motivation for miners' actions over the last year or so.  And if it is the true reason for their actions, then we wouldn't need to assume that they genuinely want larger blocks.


Yes, that will likely happen.  Which means that the default will, as usual, be status quo.  This makes me skeptical that it will happen.

I'm curious what you think the fringe benefits would be, care to elaborate?
Also, I posted something vaguely related [here]( that you might be interested in reading.

The thing is, if segwit2x starts to roll out, the first thing that will happen is segwit.
This part has a decent chance of going smoothly, because most of the network is supportive, or at least prepared, for segwit.
The hardfork 3 months after is an entirely different animal...large chunks of the community are not prepared for that.

Should be 4 years.
One block every 2 weeks means 26 blocks a year.

I think you mean "open", not "locked".  Locked falsely implies that you can't use it, or it's stuck or something.
And if someone is willing to receive payments to a channel as well as make payments from it, then I don't see why it would be so crazy for a channel to say open for more than a year.

Fractional reserve banking and the printing of currency aren't necessarily intertwined.
It would be entirely possible for a national to ban fractional reserve banking, but still print as much of its own currency as it wants.
Also, fractional reserve banking is technically possible, even under a deflationary currency, such as bitcoin.

Of course nothing is for certain, but is there a particular obstacle to large-scale LN adoption that you had in mind when writing this?

Careful, it's not correct.  S/he describes the BGP in the first half of the post, and in the second just described public key cryptography, which existed before bitcoin and solves entirely different problems.

If anyone genuinely knows what will happen (which no one does), then they're going to their own trades and not telling anyone about it.
I think what we can say is that this is a high-risk high-reward period of time.  That is, we might be seeing some disastrous chain splits during the second half of this year, which would almost certainly coincide with a price drop.  At the same time, we might sail through this period smoothly, and get some scaling to boot, which would probably cause a climb in price.
If you want to know whether to buy or sell, a better question is: how strong is your stomach?

I've heard that it won't be able to work in the same way...but not function at all?

This would be a valid point if storage was the limiting factor, but unfortunately that is not the case at the moment.  RAM (for the UTXO set), and CPU (for validation) and especially bandwidth (for several different reasons) are much greater concerns.

What if they offer interest on one's deposit (which they earn by lending it to other people)?
In the future, if and when the price has stabilized, this seems entirely possible to me.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:16:17
Yes and no, depending what you're asking about.
It would involved two different transition periods.  The first part would involved a soft-fork to segwit.
The second part, 3 months later, would involve a hardfork to double the allowed blocksize (presumably by doubling segwit's new blockweight constant).
So the segwit part does *not* need a hardfork, but the further capacity increase *does*.

Ok, that seems reasonable.  Yeah, looking back it looks like I missed a bit of context originally.  Thanks for clarifying.

Anyone know if and where I can get more information about this?
If not, could you spare a moment to expand on that, please?

Soylent bottle ;) 
You see 이종석 filming his scene there? 
Nice of his crew to clear everyone out of the way for me ;)

My understanding is that those are the sizes of blocks we'd need to scale to lightning-network levels of throughput (at least by current estimates).
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:07:48


Such as?

What part are you stuck at?  If I can, I'll clarify for you.
