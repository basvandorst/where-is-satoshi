We hire Bitcoin because of the value it gives us.  Many people hire it because of cheap transactions.  I think Trace is wrong to think solely on getting people to want to pay fees to hire Bitcoin.  Part of the appeal of Bitcoin is keep the fees low.  Sure some will hire Bitcoin by paying fees and utilizing the blockchain.  Others will hire Bitcoin not by paying fees, but by buying Bitcoin and using it as payment system or store of value.  Both can help push the price of Bitcoin up.
We should be keeping fees as low as possible to attract the most people to hire Bitcoin by buying Bitcoin.  Sure its good to have such a good product that others will want to pay mining fees as well.  But its very hard with only 1MB blocks.  That is why the [Fidelity Problem]( is so important.  Fidelity investments told Jeff Garzik they want to flip the switch on their beta program but can't because it will instantly fill Bitcoin's capacity.  We have potential buyers trying to buy Bitcoin right now!  They would probably pay 100s of millions of dollars in fees to miners, and they would probably buy a lot of Bitcoin too.  Does Trace even know about the Fidelity Problem?  There is a reason people are spending $300,000 on a conference about this issue.  There is a reason this issue is front and center.  Its an important issue, and if we don't raise the blocksize soon we are at risk of being replaced by a different currency.

I usually agree with most of what he says.  But unfortunately I have to agree with your criticisms of him on this issue.  I think he should be more respectful too.
