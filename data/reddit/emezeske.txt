What do you mean by stress? Ethereum has been processing far more transactions per second than Bitcoin for a while now:

Provided that you enjoy $30 transaction fees.  :)

For the same reason that you would use Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin Cash Classic Gold -- the hash rate is higher on the main network and thus it is more secure.

I see that I have not made my argument clear.
The company Apple has a market cap of $713B, whereas Google's market cap is $579B. Therefore Apple is worth more than Google. This is a plain fact.
Would you compare one share of Apple (AAPL, $136) to one share of Google (GOOG, $828)? Do you think that the price of an Apple share should "have parity" with the price of a Google share? Or do you understand that each share represents a different fraction of ownership in the company?

One bitcoin is a completely arbitrary amount of bitcoin, and in the same way one troy ounce of gold is a completely arbitrary amount of gold. Why do you think that parity between an arbitrary amount of bitcoin and an arbitrary amount of gold is important?
Why don't we compare the price of one bitcoin to the price of one *gram* of gold? Wowee, now bitcoin looks great! One bitcoin is worth $1,181, whereas one gram of gold is only worth $40! Bitcoin wins big time. Way beyond parity!
The thing is, for every bitcoin that has currently been mined there are 364 troy ounces of gold above ground. Why do you wish to see 1:1 parity when bitcoin:gold is 1:364?

I'm so sick of the comparison between the price of 1 bitcoin versus the price of 1 ounce of gold. There's no correspondence between these two units!
1 bitcoin is one twenty-one millionth of all bitcoin that will ever be mined. 1 oz of gold is 1 six-billionth of all gold that's been mined so far (and we don't really know how much will eventually be mined) [1].
If we want to compare 1 bitcoin to something, it should be 1 / 21M (bitcoins) * 5.8B (oz gold) = 277 oz gold. That would let us compare the total fraction of all bitcoin owned versus the total fraction of all gold owned.
So to own one twenty-one millionth of all bitcoin, it costs $1,200, and to own one twenty-one millionth of all gold, it costs $348,743.

They're paying transaction fees just like anybody else. Who are you to tell them what kinds of transactions are legitimate?

If no one uses Bitcoin at all, blocks will be even smaller.

You seem to be under the incorrect impression that Tasker is a task manager app.  Despite its name, it actually is not what you think it is.  It actually is basically a GUI-configured scripting language for your phone that lets you set up rules like "when my phone is flipped over" or "when a call comes in" and have them trigger reactions like "run this app" or "send a text message."  It's extremely general and powerful, and you can do all kinds of hilariously awesome things with it.  And it is way, way outside the bounds of what Apple lets you do with their platform.  It doesn't even require root access or anything.  It's pretty awesome:

Bitcoin is not censored on Google+.  Just search for the  hashtag -- there are hundreds of posts in just the last few days.  I follow several people that talk about Bitcoin and their posts definitely show up in my stream.

Total linkbait title for this Reddit post -- nowhere does the article claim that the Obama administration is "eying" bitcoin next.  The article itself just speculates about what the LR takedown might imply for bitcoin, but offers zero factual indication that it's in the government's sights.
By the way, the article's original headline doesn't contain the counterfactual linkbait part, "IRS, Obama Admin Aim to Kill Liberty Reserve With $6B USD Suit."

Well, if you want to draw the social media analogy, then you have to acknowledge the Myspace -&gt; Facebook dominance shift.  By all accounts, Myspace had enough "network effect" to make entry into their market all but impossible, but we all know how that went.
