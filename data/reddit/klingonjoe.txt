Not a bad or untested idea.  Ecuador adopted the dollar with some success

It wouldn’t be Chavez’ take over of private industries in the name of the revolution or the rampant violence or the adoption of Marxist economic policy.  
The embargo only affects the political leadership, so the Cuba-sucks because the US is a bully argument is not valid for the Venezuelan failed-state.

He did a really good job giving back to the people.  Although you must mean mostly his daughter - who is now the wealthiest person in Venezuela - and his inner circle. 
By your definition of people (People = Chavez Daughter + inner circle) then redistribution did happen (Chavez made his Elite quite rich) and the US is waging economic war (by adding economic sanction to the Bolivarian Kleptocracy). 
But heck who cares about truth if you are either a first world country left wing intellectual / revolutionary or a government sponsored troll.  Either way you are waist of your good life pursuing a lie. 
I thin you overstates the case about How much the US cares of Venezuela’s puny 1M barrels of daily oil production.  North Dakota has easily surpassed that production with lighter / higher quality crude.

Funny enough Venezuela tried to launch its own crypto - a bit of a joke, mostly because Venezuelan government is a Cuban-backed narco kleptocracy.  
Everything they touch then turns into �� - fiat currencies being particularly vulnerable to abuse.  
I wonder if they could have launched an oil-backed cryptocurrency, i.e. proof of work coming from each barrel of oil extracted.  But then, central government would have to balance their books and money could be tracked from the ledgers.  What fun is that if you are politician in the narco + corruption business!
