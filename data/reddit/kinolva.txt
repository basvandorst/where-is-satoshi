First off: what you're doing is brilliant. Thank you. If I had been in as early as you, I hope I would be as generous.

Don't worry. Here's the full text... (For Archival purposes!) Collected from Wayback Machine ([ (snapshot from 9/11/2018): 
 I am a time-traveler from the future, here to beg you to stop what you are doing.
I am sending this message from the year 2025. Things are looking bleak here, and some of you will carry blood on your hands.
If you don't believe me, please move on, as I have no way of proving to you I'm really who I claim to be.
I don't want to waste any of your time, so I'm merely going to explain what happened.
On average, every year so far, the value of Bitcoin has increased by about a factor ten. From 0.1 dollar in 2010, to 1 dollar in 2011, to 10 dollar in 2012, to 100 dollar in 2013. From now on, there's a slight slowdown, as the value increased by a factor ten every two years, to 1,000 dollar in 2015, to 10,000 in 2017, 100,000 in 2019, and 1,000,000 in 2021. From here onwards, there's no good way of expressing its value in dollars, as the dollar is no longer used, nor is any central bank issued currency for that matter. There are two main forms of wealth in today's world. Land and cryptocurrency.
There are just over 19 million Bitcoin known to be used in the world today, as well as a few hundred thousand that were permanently lost, and we're still dealing with a population of just over 7 billion people today. On average, this means the average person owns just under 0.003 bitcoin. However, due to the unequal distribution of wealth in my world, the *mean* person owns just 0.001 bitcoin. That's right, most of you reading this today are rich. I personally live next to an annoying young man who logged into his old Reddit account two years ago and discovered that he received a tip of 0.01 Bitcoin back in 2013 for calling someone a "faggot" when he was a 16 year old boy. Upon making this discovery he bought an airline ticket, left his house without telling anyone anything and went to a Citadel.
"What is a Citadel?" you might wonder. Well, by the time Bitcoin became worth 1,000 dollar, services began to emerge for the "Bitcoin rich" to protect themselves as well as their wealth. It started with expensive safes, then began to include bodyguards, and today, "earlies" (our term for early adapters), as well as those rich whose wealth survived the "transition" live in isolated gated cities called Citadels, where most work is automated. Most such Citadels are born out of the fortification used to protect places where Bitcoin mining machines are located. The company known as ASICminer to you is known to me as a city where Mr. Friedman rules as a king.
In my world, soon to be your world, most governments no longer exist, as Bitcoin transactions are done anonymously and thus most governments can enforce no taxation on their citizens. Most of the success of Bitcoin is due to the fact that Bitcoin turned out to be an effective method to hide your wealth from the government. Whereas people entering "rogue states" like Luxemberg, Monaco and Liechtenstein were followed by unmanned drones to ensure that governments know who is hiding wealth, no such option was available to stop people from hiding their money in Bitcoin.
Governments tried to stay relevant in my society by buying Bitcoin, which just made the problem worse, by increasing the value of Bitcoin. Governments did so in secret of course, but my generation's "Snowdens" are in fact greedy government employees who transferred Bitcoin to their own private account, and escaped to anarchic places where no questions are asked as long as you can cough up some money.
The four institutions with the largest still accessible Bitcoin balance are believed to be as following:
\-ASICminer - 50,000 Bitcoin
\-The IMF's "currency stabilization fund" - 70,000 Bitcoin
\-Government of Saudi Arabia - 110,000 Bitcoin
\-The North Korean government - 180,000 Bitcoin
Economic growth today is about -2% per year. Why is this? If you own more than 0.01 Bitcoin, chances are you don't do anything with your money. There is no inflation, and thus no incentive to invest your money. Just like the medieval ages had no significant economic growth, as wealth was measured in gold, our society has no economic growth either, as people know their 0.01 Bitcoin will be enough to last them a lifetime. The fact that there are still new Bitcoin released is what prevents our world from collapse so far it seems, but people fear that the decline in inflation that will occur during the next block halving may further wreck our economy.
What happened to the Winklevoss twins? The Winklevoss twins were among the first to die. After seeing the enormous damage done to the fabric of society, terrorist movements emerged that sought to hunt down and murder anyone known to have a large balance of Bitcoin, or believed to be responsible in any way for the development of cryptocurrency. Ironically, these terrorist movements use Bitcoin to anonymously fund their operations.
Most people who own any significant amount of Bitcoin no longer speak to their families and lost their friends, because they had to change their identities. There have been also been a few suicides of people who could not handle the guilt after seeing what happened to the bag-holders, the type of skeptical people who continued to believe it would eventually collapse, even after hearing the rumors of governments buying Bitcoin. Many people were taken hostage, and thus, it is suspected that 25% percent of "Bitcoin rich" actually physically tortured someone to get him to spill his password.
Why didn't we abandon Bitcoin, and move to another system? Well, we tried of course. We tried to step over to an inflationary cryptocurrency, but nobody with an IQ above 70 was willing to step up first and volunteer. After all, why would you voluntarily invest a lot of your money into a currency where you know your wealth will continually decline? The thing that made Bitcoin so dangerous to society was also what made it so successful. Bitcoin allows us to give into our greed.
In Africa, surveys show that an estimated 70% of people believe that Bitcoin was invented by the devil himself. There's a reason for this. It's a very sensitive issue that today is generally referred to as "the tragedy". The African Union had ambitious plans to help its citizens be ready to step over to Bitcoin. Governments gave their own citizens cell phones for free, tied to their government ID, and thus government sought to integrate Bitcoin into their economy. All went well, until "the tragedy" that is. A criminal organization, believed to be located in Russia, exploited a hardware fault in the government issued cell phones. It's believed that the entire continent of Africa lost an estimated 60% of its wealth in a period of 48 hours. What followed was a period of chaos and civil war, until the Saudi Arabian and North Korean governments, two of the world's major superpowers due to their authoritarian political system's unique ability to adapt to the "Bitcoin challenge", divided most African land between themselves and were praised as heroes by the local African population for it.
You might wonder, what is our plan now? It's clear that the current situation can not be sustained, without ending in a nuclear holocaust. I am part of an underground network, who seek to launch a coordinated attack against the very infrastructure of the Internet itself. We have at our disposal about 20 nuclear submarines, which we will use to cut all underwater cables between different continents. After this has been successfully achieved, we will launch a simultaneous nuclear pulse attack on every densely population area of the world. We believe that the resulting chaos will allow the world's population to rise up in revolt, and destroy as many computers out there as possible, until we reach the point where Bitcoin loses any relevance.
Of course, this outcome will likely lead to billions of deaths. This is a price we are forced to pay, to avoid the eternal enslavement of humanity to a tiny elite.
This is also the reason we contacted you.
It doesn't have to be like this. You do not have to share our fate. I don't know how, but you must find a way to destroy this godforsaken project in its infancy. I know this is a difficult thing to ask of you. You believed you were helping the world by eliminating the central banking cartel that governs your economies.
However, I have seen where it ends.

Well done supporting the network!
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:07:58
I agree. And [hyperbitcoinization]( also. 
I think that all of the work places like Gemini Custody and Bakkt and even ICE are doing help move the social conditions toward a tipping point. IE: these are all environmental factors that make the massive gold rush you are describing more likely. All the infrastructure and regulatory framework are necessary if large management teams, family offices, pensions, and governments are going to allocate 1-10% of their holdings into BTC. But we are moving that direction. And quickly. 
The thing about tipping points is that reaching them takes a while, but then HODL ON!
This ride is going to be INSANE.

Couldn't recommend it more highly. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:59:24
Interesting. 
I have heard that "adding another zero" is possible, but what would be the reason for doing this? Presumably when it becomes too expensive (in fiat terms) to buy a whole Satoshi? 
But would this negatively effect the deflationary nature of Bitcoin? (I'm a noob when it comes to economics). 
How would "adding another zero" to the protocol be different from the Central Bank printing more dollars?
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:40:23

@_date: 2017-01-13 15:09:23
Whoa! Calm down. 
Contrary to your claim that using different denominations will


My reason for asking is that I have many friends who want to start using BTC, but can't afford $800, much less $1000+ for a whole BTC. They want to buy a portion, but telling someone "hey, you can buy .06 BTC for $50" is--again, in my experience--harder than saying "hey, you can buy 60,000 bits for $50". 
Furthermore, as (if) the relative price of BTC increases, it's less likely that people are going to be able to acquire a whole BTC, and telling people they should exchange a month's wages on .05 BTC is likely to become less compelling. 
Nevertheless, I'm not arguing for a philosophical orientation to BTC here, but rather to the importance of giving end users the option to display their holdings however they want and in whatever form they feel most comfortable using. If users are given the option, you can keep it in BTC, and I can use bits, and somebody else can use one of the other commonly accepted denominations. 
Choice is power. That's my point. Stop acting so bloody fascist.

@_date: 2017-01-13 15:35:45
Define Fascism: "an authoritarian system of social organization."
Choice and individual empowerment is the historically-proven antidote to fascism. That's why I'm saying: "give users a choice." Simply saying "you must do it this way or else..." tends toward authoritarian / totalitarian control. Thus, this approach is problematic.
To be clear: I can't WAIT for the day when I will buy a nice meal for 100 Satoshi. But as an intermediate step, I'm looking forward to the day when I can buy a nice meal with 100 bits.
And to be clear: I am **forever** grateful to Satoshi. I want to see the project succeed. That's why I'm asking this question.
@_date: 2016-11-16 04:01:03
Agreed. Historical examples abound.

Agreed: supply and demand control a great deal.
That's the point of my suggestion: if all supply is cut off except for at the price of 1 bit = 1 USD, then buyers will be forced to pay it (if they want to purchase).

You, Sir Charles, are missing my point: all people whom today possess a great deal of monetary resources can't possibly purchase a whole bitcoin. This is a fact. Bitcoin's possible future value simply adds further emphasis to what is already logically true in the present.
@_date: 2019-10-20 00:39:42
Not asking anybody for any information about their HODLings. Rather: providing this as a tool to understand where one's HODLings exist on a spectrum from 0 to 21,000,000.  Asking for feedback on the form itself. IE: Should I edit it?
IE: The original article wasn't asking for a response... It was providing a tool. That's what I'm trying to do here, but for BTC instead of Fiat.

I hope you're right. October 2019?

Furthermore: what all the "s" growth curve comparisons leave out is that Bitcoin's potential growth isn't just about current human population size, but human population FOR THE REST OF HUMAN EXISTENCE.
They can make more IPhones as more people are born.
There will never be more than 21M bitcoin, even if there are 100bn people living in the solar system in 500 years. Let that sink in.

I agree with your point. But, just a reminder: the cost of 1 BTC is currently \~$9300 USD, ostensibly pocket change for a millionaire. So they don't need to "sell all other 'stuff'" in order to buy a BTC. At least not at the beginning...

Simplest thing to do (that I've found): set a threshold below which you will absolutely not sell anything. My own personal threshold is $100k. Maybe yours is $50K. Or $500K.  
Since I first bought BTC I have tricked myself into not allowing myself to even think about selling until it reaches that threshold. This provides an emotional firewall of sorts. Daily fluctuations don't really bother me because I know I'm not selling / using BTC until it is worth $100K. That, or I'm going down with the ship. One or the other.

Thanks for engaging with my security concerns. 
What you are suggesting is that I trust what you are saying, or that I trust the moderators in various communities. This helps alleviate some of my concerns. 
But--as you know--crypto is "trustless" which I take to mean that it is a system which allows me to cryptographically verify that you are who you say you are. Is there a way you can provide a signed message (ie: signed by a private key that only Ledger would be in possession of?) to validate the authenticity of this claim?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:25:04
But you realize there would have to be substantial consensus to DEVALUE Bitcoin's smallest unit in order for this to happen, right? It would be a form of self-harm to do so, which, in my opinion, makes it very unlikely to occur....
@_date: 2019-12-10 10:32:08
PSA: IS THIS LEGITIMATE? SERIOUS PRIVACY / SECURITY CONCERNS EXIST IN REQUESTS LIKE THIS!!!
If this is legitimate, it should be easy enough for "Nicole" to prove her identity as a representative of Ledger. (easy enough to do: Sign a message with one of Ledger's private keys to prove you are who you say you are).
Otherwise: STAY AWAY!
Edit: I am NOT trying to troll this initiative. I think it is really cool. And, I own several Ledgers and LOVE them. But security and privacy are a big deal. And we all need to take that seriously.

I know u/nina_crypto is moderator of r/ledgerwallet. But how do you know that u/nina_crypto hasn't been compromised, and is now actively trying to dox crypto users? REMEMBER: Being your own bank means minimizing risk across your attack surfaces. 
Before ANYONE responds to this request, I suggest that (at MINIMUM):
a) Ledger's Chairman and Co-Founder (**u/murzika)** confirm on Reddit that this is a legitimate request. The likelihood of BOTH of these accounts being simultaneously compromised is not zero, but is lower than just ONE reddit account (u/Nina\_crypto) being compromised. 
b) Ledger post a blog entry at their website ([ announcing this opportunity. 
c) u/nina_crypto edit the above invitation with a signed message that users can use to confirm that u/nina_crypto is in possession of a private key that is known to be Ledger's. 
I would be happy to participate in this conversation. But not until I am 100% sure that I'm actually speaking with Ledger, not someone PRETENDING to be Ledger for nefarious purposes.

Good point. But, in a sense, even change address value has still been transacted (ie: transferred from one address to another). So, for my purposes, that counts as "value transacted on the Bitcoin blockchain."
For those who are interested: doing the above (ie: downloading CSV and tallying up totals) at a USD/BTC value of $10,700 equals $24,805,932,898,357.70. 
Pretty impressive. Although, there is a massive sense in which this is inaccurate, because the USD/BTC value has obviously not always been $10,700. 
If anybody wants to go to the trouble of updating each line of the CSV to the average daily USD/BTC value and then add THOSE up, please let me know!

Your post seems to suggest such a change is easily possible, accomplishable on a whim, in an arbitrary manner. If this is what you are implying, you fundamentally misunderstand what would be required to make that kind of change. IE: In order to make such a change to the total number of Bitcoin available, the economic majority of the Bitcoin community would need to believe that such a change is in their economic interest. In other words: it's very unlikely to happen.

I agree in part... However, your argument fails when applied to the development of the Internet itself, a comparison I believe Bitcoin warrants as opposed to equating it with a "pure" stock or commodity (in which scenario your argument would hold).  
What I mean is, your argument applied to the early days of the internet is nonsensical: because the network effect is what drove the development of new use cases in the development / expansion of the Internet and the underlying networks / protocols, all the speculators / hoarders / corporations that were attracted to it actually helped it mature and develop. 
I see that happening in Bitcoin today. (And, I don't think a "crash" from $4K to $800 is the same as the "dot com bubble" popping. When we're at $100K and it drops to $60K, then I'll agree to the parallel).

@_date: 2017-05-21 14:18:49


I am fully in support of SegWit, etc. But this is my question regarding UASF. The main problem we have with SegWit activation (as I understand it) is that Jihan and his mining cartel don't want it and are therefore blocking it AND ALSO that Jihan controls (an estimated) 51%+ of mining hashrate with covert ASICBoost. (Correct me if I'm wrong here). 
If having 51%+ dedicated to the UASF is a **necessary condition** for a successful roll out of UASF, could someone please explain how is is possible to achievable this given Jihan's mining cartel? 
EDIT: edited for clarity of my question
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:46:19
Thanks for the explanation. Really helpful. 
In answer to your second question: No, I cannot think of anyone wanting a Jihan only chain. Except in the instance of Jihan deploying an (as yet undiscovered) attack (a la AntBleed) on the mining hardware of the other chain, thus bricking it. 
I wouldn't put it past him. Indeed, that's precisely what AntBleed seems to be designed for. 
Posted this exact question [here]( 
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:08:24

I'll be excited when we get to $10K / BTC. Until then it's just turbulence--a rounding error on the world economy. With a $200+bn market cap, BTC will have proven itself, will be past the scaling debate, and will have major traction. That's when the serious fun begins. 
I like seeing the numbers on my spreadsheets go up, but until then, it's really just a spike-drop-yawn-repeat.

One word: Trezor. Get one. Use it. Safest way to secure / spend BTC (IMO). I could be wrong, but that's what I'm doing.

Thanks. And thanks for pointing me in a good direction. I have a computer science background, but have only a surface level understanding of cryptography. Excited to dig in more!

I like the way you think! Confirmed.

If that's the moon, I confess I'm more interested in Jupiter or the Andromeda Galaxy or whatever we want to call it... IE: $1M 2008 USD. Total Value Cap: $21 trillion USD. 
Anything less is insufficient. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:24:04
I'd even settle for a Tesla. ;-)

paging u/nullc and u/luke-jr. Thoughts on this?
Also: what does this "agreement" do to ASICBOOST?

Any alternatives you'd suggest?
@_date: 2017-07-07 04:27:51
NICE!!! I love it. How about $50K November, 2018 (see if I have any of that oracle blood...)
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:14:14
Right. India also... And oh yeah: a massive demonetization in recent memory. 
Bitcoin to the rescue!

Wait. Running an LN node generates passive income? How? Please explain. I'm VERY interested...
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:53:55
Yeah... And now people are talking about $5K. What do you think? You seem to be an oracle!
@_date: 2017-05-20 05:01:43
Imperial fuck ton indeed. 
Now if only they'd all want to own one BTC.... The run up would be a beautiful thing to behold.
Hell. I'd settle for 10% of them wanting 1 BTC... Given lost coins and HODLers, that run-up would be beautiful as well!
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:24:43
I like the sound of that!
What do you think your net worth needs to be to have a private jet? And is it better to own or to rent? (Just trying to be prepared. Moonsuit and all that!)

Okay. Good point. I should have written "IMPORTANT" or "CRITICAL". Not "URGENT". Would edit but can't change title. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:01:28
WTF? Is that a threat? Or are you just referring to how hard Governments are going to try to shut this thing down?
Edit: or something else?
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:36:57
Link to safe manufacturer? Intrigued. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:45:56
That's when I MIGHT consider cashing out... 
No not really ;)
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:04:55
BRILLIANT. Thanks for posting this. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:29:56
Amazing. I doubt you'd be interested in doing this, but if you ever create an Instructables or a DIY guide, I'd be very interested. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:55:47
That would be great news. Source?

How about $3000? We blew through $2000 weeks ago... starting to get bored over here!

This. I've been saying it for years. Bits, bits, and more bits.
