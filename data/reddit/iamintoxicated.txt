I've been on reddit since slashdot was a thing and well before the digg migration. Imagine not giving a fuck about internet points and preferring to drop accounts every few months. 
I've just looked at your reddit account.... this is a way of life for you. Good luck.

I'd rather eat my own dick than sit through that garbage, even if crypto is mentioned.

"Market Cap" in terms of crypto was born on bitcointalk forums. It's TOTAL VALUE. I've been around a long time.

I've been singing the same tune since early 2013, and it's a tune that has PAID. Maybe the ,"good god" comment will have more of an effect on your co-worker in the cubicle over. You take it easy now, boss.

The whole idea behind decentralized and open financial networks is that they kind of turn banks into Blockbuster. If banks want to create an open and decentral network for finance and contracts... so be it. They still lose their power.
Most people believe it will be Bitcoin, the second most viable crypto is Eth. I trade all top 10 crypto and gamble on some long shots.
Blockbuster is bad analogy by the way. It's more akin to cars for the masses vs horses or some shit. I'll try again later.

Credit Unions could still exist. Fractional reserve banks... not so much.

I guess you've missed the whole ICO financing mania? Look, when the net first hit... it would have been close to impossible to predict Netflix, Ebay, Amazon, Google, Facebook. In fact, early net pioneers were laughed at for even suggesting someone might share personal info online... credit card numbers...you were a nutter.
Nobody said we'd stop using currency. We don't call it cryptocurrency for nothing.

What were you implying by the, "good god" comment?
"There are a lot of idiots on the internet, including here."
Piss off now.

The price is being speculated on because the underlying technology is going to underpin web 3 and 4.0
It's incredibly difficult to value something that will be used to exchange value across the IoT and AI machines, not to mention the entire global population. This is a disruptive technology. If you're still not seeing it, well... you can comment about the "core issues" again when btc is at 100k. With that being said, it's a highly volatile and frightening ride. The winners of this thing will be valued well into the trillions and the losers will die slow deaths. I can't wait to see which crypto survive the next crash and bear market. Either way, I'll make bank.
