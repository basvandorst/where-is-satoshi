Nobody wants to talk about how Tether has been pumping the market since November.

Tether just printed 100m an hour ago, enjoy your pump today

He's doing it for the sole political purpose of gaining more Republican senators.

Seems fine.

So are every other large metropolitan areas vs rural areas in every state.

Yeah I fucking live here lmao. Dividing the state up wouldn't do anything except give Republicans 4 additional senate seats, the state is in budget surplus right now and things are fine. The only annoying thing is housing costs because local cities keep slowing down the pace of building.

Tether needs to collapse for Bitcoin to be seen by some as to be legitimate again. The whole wash trading and ties to the pump from August - January really fucks things up in the eyes of many.

When Tether collapses in the next few months, do you think we'll see BTC to 2k or 3k?

This doesn't make patreon obsolete as patreon autocharges monthly, does eat into kickstarter/indiegogo a bit though I guess.
