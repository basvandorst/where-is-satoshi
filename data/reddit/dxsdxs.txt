I dont see much demand from the community for other exchanges to show 'proof' of the reserves. How would they even go about showing proof?
Regulation is just law, which is just requirements. If the 'community' is going to regulate exchanges how do we go about it? We would have to do it with the threat of force. Who is going to arm that force and manage it all.  
Mtgox was the big boy, it has been around for years, had the best prices. Should the customer trust BTCE instead? Not even the the blockchain nerds even knew what was going on a few months ago, why is the common customer 'responsible'.
'Regulation' and 'bureacrats' have negative connotations, but essentially you are asking for requirements of exchanges (which is regulation) by each customer..   this is why the typical libertarian ideal is flawed, because it is expected that the customer is responsible for everything... so now i have to monitor my banks, my exchanges, have to be an expert in wiring for when the electrician does an install, have to be a mechanical expert so i can assess repairs to my car, have to be a medical expert to ensure the advice from my doctor is correct.. because that is better than having 'beuracrats/regulators' have laws to 'regulate'.

Well the amount of USD in existence keeps on increasing (and mainstream finance has a lot of BS in it like derivatives etc). Therefore, bitcoin, being finite should increase in USD value over time.
There is however definite speculation going on, which could lead to a crash - and BTC could even die, get hacked etc.  
If you want to get in, you can mitigate the risk by buying BTC over a long period of time instead of all at once. 
Buy anyway, keep thinking about it all - its a rabbit hole i have been going down for years now. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:57:01
you could also just interpret the move in bitcoin as a bull trap.  Ie, there has been a recent bubble, it burst, there is some stability where the bulls buy in and soon it will continue to crash back to a stable level.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:30:21
The article was a weak effort.
So from my 5 mins of investigation, it seems like the Bill will amend a law that has existed for around a decade already. This law is around money laundering, and it already mentions "e-currency". The Bill is to update the term to "digital currency" and it seems now they putting in powers for AusTrac (Australia's financial intelligence agency with regulatory responsibility for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing) to regulate "digital currency exchanges".
The Bill (referred to as the first reading speech) and the document that explains the bill (explanatory memo) can be found here:
It makes changes (amends) the existing law:
I would guess this bill will be agreed to by parliament - seems straight forward.

errr.. the reason why the Australian bank in question will be fined IS because of the regulation.   So the title is pointless, because the regulation, being the law which the bank broke, seems to have done its job.

A bubble. Everyone is on a high right now thinking the price is a 'new paradigm' - sometimes i think so too, but then i see facebook groups on bitcoin where 95% of people are morons doing pure speculation with no idea about fundamentals, see videos of 100s of gpu mining rigs where the person just went all in and are having basic problems with them. Btc has serious issues too like fee prices, miner control  
, difficulties with soft forking etc.  As i said, sometimes i think new paradigm, but probably slow bubble. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:32:59
Most people know about the [bubble graph](
And the latest rise seems to perfectly match that.
However, the last bubble peaked at $1000, so even if you bought at the peak, you would still have 4x your money after 3 years.  And people know this, so I would say a lot of people are hoping for a crash so they can cash in.
Also, bitcoin is finite and a store of wealth - if you have another 2008 you may have people wanting to put their wealth into bitcoin (or it might crash with everything else).

Basically, there are existing laws in Australia around money laundering.  Stuff like banks having to report transactions over $10,000, reporting any dodgy series of transactions etc.
Recently in the news one of the major banks in Australia has gotten in trouble for failing to report thousands of over $10,000 transactions being made using their automatic machines that allow a person to deposit cash into an account (individuals were doing heaps of these transactions, sometimes with fake accounts etc and then sending the money overseas - textbook laundering). Because they failed to report this transaction to AUSTRAC the bank is going to be fined.
This Bill is to add crypto exchanges to those existing reporting requirements (hence it is light on words, as it just adding to an existing law).  
On a side note, I would say if you had bitcoin and converted to dollars, and then had that exchange put the money in your account, if it was big money the bank receiving it would have to report it to AUSTRAC anyway.
I think years ago I sold a car for cash, and put that money into my bank account, then later got a call from the bank asking what the money was from, and I told them and they were fine with it. I guess they reported it as required.
If you care - in Australia, the country's government has two groups of people, the house of reps and the senate. A new law or change to law has to get majority vote by both of those groups before it becomes actual law.  When it is being voted on its a "bill", if is agreed on then it becomes an "act".

valid points, i guess conversely, who wants to loan to someone with such a bad credit rating - and also, countries are already inflating their currency.

@_date: 2017-04-25 01:30:06
based on steve keen's idea, the government could give each member of the population a payment of money, or many over years to smoothen it out. 
This would cause inflation and wage growth, but would deflate the currency, but gov revenue would go up to pay the debt.
Its all theory though.

Isn't china and most of the west in the same situation? (and ofcourse a lot of the developing countries).

The recent news is along the lines that Chinese exchanges are forced to close by the end of the month, and they can't accept any new accounts.
A number of people with existing chinese accounts would be selling their bitcoin, and there would be less cash coming into the exchange - hence pushing the price down on those exchanges.
Arbitrage probably is not occurring because people with say a US account, cant access the Chinese market - and also the other way around, if a Chinese person wanted to cash out it is a lot of effort to create a US bank account etc etc.
Conversely, I could ask you - why aren't you buying on Chinese exchanges.

However, there is no true intrinsic value to it (like pretty much everything in the world), and the price is currently 6x it was a year ago, and there is a lot of dumb money.   It looks like we are in the bull trap, so there will be despair ahead - when people are saying bitcoin is dead again, then buy that floor (will be a downward trend of months until that floor though).

Well the OP is a one day account with the typical "don't sell" message without any rationale behind it.
Also, I don't think my comments have been 'tricky' - if they seem complex then it might be best not to doing trading. From the peak two weeks ago, the trend has been down.  Since this rally from 600 last year, I dont think there has been 2 weeks of down trend - and this is in the context of horrible news.
I am fairly bullish long term with bitcoin (but you never know) - but short term (over the next year) I am bearish.

Conversely if BTC keeps crashing, then I could say you are hurting the newcomers that bought last week by not suggesting that the price could keep dropping and pretending it will all be ok.
No one can predict the future, but my angle is typical group/social bubble psychology and fundamentals like the china news.
This account was made at peak of the last bubble in 2013. I dealt with BTC back then, and Doge when it was brand new and bubbled up etc etc etc etc.
My comments are based on my experience.

Look at the price on Chinese exchanges, it is way lower than US.   Markets arent as simple as you are making them out to be.    The news on bitcoin has been horrible the last few days, and there are things such as bull traps.  Even if BTC goes to 1800 it is 2x it was a year ago.

Just because it is currently a bubble, doesn't make it bad.
2013 was a bubble, I would say now is a bubble too.
You have a lot of new dumb money expecting rapid gains. When that is the case and a wall comes up, due to either running out of new buyers or say bad news like the china situation. Then the price reverses a bit, and then dumb people panic and the people who bought early and are waiting for the reversal also cash in their gains to later buy at the floor.

It is basic social psychology. Look into bubble trends. We have had 6 months of euphoria without acknowledging the negatives,  we will have months of opposite now.   When people are feeling btc is over and talk about all the negatives, then you buy.
BTC went to 1200 in the last bubble, and I have screenshots of it hitting 120usd on some exchanges on the crash that followed. 10x lower.
2200, 1800, 1200, 800 is all possible in my mind.

Well, the chinese news has only happened over the last 2 days or less.   You would have to get an account at a chinese exchange and put money into it - that might not even be possible anymore, but if it is the process would take many many days and have high risks.  
There would no doubt be people with Chinese exchange accounts buying there then selling on say a US exchange - but this number is too small for it to cause prices to equalize globally.
