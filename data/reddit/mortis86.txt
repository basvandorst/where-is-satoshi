I personally believe they*should* be able to cover if not all, at least biggest amount of this loss. For the remaining one, a scenario of what poloniex did in the past would work flawlessly, even though i dont think it would be necessary. Finex is/was one of the biggest BTC exchange, and with all their pairs/coins they should be able to pull this out. End of the day, its a golden chicken. Just it got ill abit, but not in a way it cannot be cured(it willbe painful, but can be cured at least).

Cant agree more with . Stick to the plan guys. The more the trading and site is down, the higher the speculation about'inside job'/CEOs emptying bank accounts/you are all screwed scenarios will go wilder and wilder. End of the day, HOW INSECURE could it be bring the site BACK with withdrawals and trading DISABLED? we dont ask you here to provide insta-solutions, just to stick to a plan and give us something apart from inacurate information. really appreciating the hard work and stress you go through, but tell the big heads to give us smth else except missing timelines! I dont think we ask too much!

you should tie some value to the BFX coin : that way people will have reason to actually hold it and gain value. % of exchange profits/ IOUs with 1$ face value with expiry date xx/xx/xxxx, or something similar. That way, people will want to keep it and it could possibly go above the 1$ mark in value.

Not true, i asked for a withdrawal of 475 BTC 4h ago, and i got it in under 1h. I guess they fill it only to send withdrawals and they leave it on 0 on purpose..? But thats just speculation

I hope they still lean that way. Its the only viable way, combined with some sort of bfxcoin/reimbursment over time for affected users

can you at least rule out bankrupsy and be 100% that the platform will reopen, one way or another? Thats all i need to hear before i go to bed. Like pretty please.

I can confirm i had exactly the same issue when i requested a withdrawal of 15k$ 2 months ago. Same questioneere . Just answer everything normally and you will be ok :)

I can confirm too that i cannot withdraw 15 BTC from my account. Same error, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW BITCOINS AT THE MOMENT.
Sent a ticket support 6h ago still nothing. No open orders or anything like this. In matter of fact, i have 65 bitoins @ Stamp and i wanted to withdraw just the 15 of them to sell them locally
