Actually the dollar took a hit this week. That could explain it. We could probably compare btc to other currencies and see for sure. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:52:54
So what can we attribute this weeks spike too?

Giving a discount for using cash is typically against most cc companies TOS

You meant 30k bitcoins? I thought you meant dollars 
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:29:26
Bitcoin recently spiked. Will we see $700+ btc anytime soon? I know this is impossible to answer but your thoughts perhaps?
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:18:54
except if i read the article correctly, bidding starts at 200k
Edit: ok guys relax. I thought he meant 30k dollars, not bitcoins. No need to be dicks about it.

And I love it. I've made a few thousand bucks buying on the dip and selling on the spike.

Shhh. You are giving away my secret pro strategy
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:53:08
Yes but 30k won't do shit for you if bidding starts at 200k
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:52:03
Yes but he said "30k"
My point is you need to have 200k to even come to the party. Lots of us have 30k, not that many people have 200k+ lying around

I've been pretty successful on speculation this year. I try to buy when bad news comes out and sell when it recovers. Bought when gox went down. Every time china threatens to outlaw it etc.

Wow thanks. I can't believe I've been following this sub for over a year and I didn't know about this 
@_date: 2014-06-13 10:56:07
This part of the discussion is going on a huge tangent. I simply meant that if he was talking about having 30k to bid with it wouldn't do anything for him.

I am DEFINITELY not a pro. Just lucky. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:17:06
Let me know if you figure it out. I dont see how to edit anywhere

Can someone explain like I'm 5 how to download bit store. The video was actually unclear to me. It starts off with "simply download bit store" well. Where to I download bit store from. Sorry

Wut? People invest in currency all the time. Traded just like everything else. It's called the FOREX market.

100k in no time. This is a great sub reddit.
