Here's the scenario:
Someone agrees to pay $10 usd for a service. The service provider uses [insert solution] to invoice in usd - for accounting purposes only because they hold the received funds in btc rather than converting to fiat.
The customer is in a different country and using a different fiat to buy coins to pay the bill (let's say euro). So the service provider will send [insert solution] to the customer who will present this to a broker to buy coins. Customer pays the broker in euro, service provider receives $10usd equivalent in btc. 
It would be like bitpay but without settling to fiat (and without using a financial institution) or like circle pays send and request funds feature.
Is there such thing as a static qr code that represents an exact value in fiat at the time of payment?
Thanks again for working with me on this!

Thanks for this info. I should clarify that I dont want to convert the btc to fiat, only need to settle an invoice that is priced in fiat. Example: send an invoice for $100 usd, and give something to the person paying for them to present at a btc ATM or similar and then put the exact amount of any currency they use to pay the equivalent of $100 usd in btc. Ideally something simple so as not to confuse new adopters.  
What can you suggest for this?
