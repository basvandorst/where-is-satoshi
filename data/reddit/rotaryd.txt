Oops. Wrong crypto.

Owner is using the Jaguar as a form of advertising for his bitcoin 'investing' business, therefore he was able to claim the purchase cost as an expense against his 1000x gain. Maybe.

Hmm... the users of the site agreed to these terms and in return get to play with massive leverage. This is a non-event and should be expected.

Just spent 15 minutes trying to buy one of these. Can someone explain why Bitpay made it impossible to pay with crypto?

You guys over rea

... but they know you have / use crypto, so perhaps you end up a different kind of target?

Go to a local bitcoin meetup. Someone there will probably be willing to exchange a bit, or refer you to someone who might be interested in exchanging more. The point is, stop relying on the stupid financial system when there is a perfectly good one right here with crypto.

Ugh!!! Right after I stopped procrastinating and bought one full wheel!

btw, with the SSD, and the new .10 core, the blockchain only took 7 hours to sync. the electrum server installation took about 2.

Long time electrum fan/user... with the 2.0 release I can't wait for more people to get on board! I recently took my electrum obsession to the next level... I'm now running a full-node and an electrum server open to the public. If you are an electrum user feel free to use connect to my server at rotarydialer.webhop.net:50002 (SSL) If you want to run your own full node and electrum server you could try out vultr.com for an SSD VPS provider...  the referal link here will also help me keep the server running: 
Oh, there's a bitcoin donation address in the wallet console if you connect to my server in case anyone wants to donate directly :P

Hi! I'm running a full-node and an electrum server! I'd love some support to help pay for the server expenses. If you are an electrum user, feel free to use connect to my server: rotarydialer.webhop.net:50002 (SSL)

I am using the $35 one... the blockchain takes ~40gb and the electrum database (with pruning set to 100) takes about 10gb. I'm thinking that I could upgrade it to the $70/mo one when if maxes out. Fun project. you can find me on IRC if you want to discuss... freendode, nick: rotarydialer

That number looks like it comes from the San Fernando Valley... aka "The Valley" ... you know... the "gag me with a spoon" Valley. Oh... the porn production capital of the USA. hmmm...

Thank you for your service! And thank you to all the veterans who spent coins (and continue to spend coins!). 
You helped grow the economy from nothing and Bitcoin would have no value without the sacrifices like yours. Plus, you got a shirt purchased with something that the average person believed held no real value at the time.
