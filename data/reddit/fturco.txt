I would happily use Segwit, but currently my wallet (Bitcoin Core) doesn't support it well.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:39:14
I use Bitstamp since 2014. Never had any problem with them.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:28:55
I'll use Segwit addresses when Bitcoin Core will let me use them instead of legacy addresses.

The single most important thing for security is avoiding proprietary software. Don't use macOS or Windows. Use GNU/Linux.

Fossil fuels are finite. Nuclear fuel is finite. The amount of solar energy hitting the Earth is also finite. It's not FUD.

Mac is also a very bad choice for storing bitcoins because it's a proprietary operating system.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:56:13
Free as in gratis? Maybe. Free as in freedom? Definitively not. Please don't store your passwords in a proprietary application.

96% of economists say Bitcoin is a bubble (which is false).

Why so much difference between economists and scientists?

I agree, I think Bitcoin is also improving my mental health somewhat, and gives me hope for the future. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:08:56

I started using Bitcoin in early 2014, but I don't feel I'm an early adopter. I definitively wish I started earlier.

I learned about the HODL philosophy only this year. I wish I did that back in 2013.

I was referring to the solar energy output that the Earth can capture in a year. But strictly speaking even the total amount of energy the Sun can produce in its lifetime is finite, since it will disappear in about 5 billion years.

Please don't make this mistake. Don't buy useless luxury cars with bitcoins (or fiat).

I plan to keep bitcoins forever. I'm not going to sell them unless I desperately need to buy something with fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:17:18


Remember that gold is not only a store of value, but it's used in all sorts of industrial applications (i.e. electronics). So it's value will never crash to zero. But I agree that Bitcoin should defeat gold as a store of value.

1. Global warming is real and is due to human activity. There's no doubt about that among climate scientists.
2. Hydroelectric power is not 100% environmental friendly, and it often requires the (forced) relocation of thousands of people.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:25:36
In my opinion the best way to decrease global economic inequality is to heavily tax the rich (both rich persons in individual countries and rich countries). And then redistribute the money. A universal basic income comes to mind, for example. Having rich people is wasteful because their money is often wasted on luxury items or otherwise unnecessary (or harmful) things. And, most importantly, because concentrated money equals concentrated political power, which is harmful for democracy. Having poor people on the other hand is wasteful because of loss of human potential (education, health, crime, etc). But all of this doesn't really depend on using fiat money vs. cryptocurrencies. Governments should redistribute resources no matter what kind of money their citizens adopt.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:02:10

I see your point, but comparing Bitcoin (which is 100% free software) to Windows (which is one of the worst proprietary software) is not a good thing. Windows is currently mainstream but we should stop using it. Bitcoin is not mainstream yet but we should help spreading it.

You will be proven wrong. Windows and other proprietary operating systems will lose in the end. Free software will prevail as a desktop operating system too.

I really wish such kind of cars to be banned worldwide. Who needs a top speed of 250 mph? Is everybody a professional racer? Don't waste your bitcoins on luxury cars.

I'm a long time FastMail user but now I'm disappointed. We are still in the early phases of Bitcoin adoption, so of course only a small number of people pay with them. But you either encourage adoption, or hinder it. It seems FastMail is choosing the latter.

Schools should teach critical thinking, so students can go to the Internet and learn by themselves. Without critical thinking the Internet is actually dangerous because there's plenty of bullshit, fake news, etc.

Electrum is fine, but it is just a bitcoin wallet for holding your bitcoins. It won't give you any interest opportunity.

I think a certain amount of obedience is needed in order to be able to teach anything else. So teaching obedience is a prerequisite of teaching critical thinking. Obedience should not be a substitute of critical thinking or other skills.

I'm interested too, since it seems I cannot convince my parents to invest in bitcoin, no matter what I say.

Spending money and resources on luxury cars is always dumb, no matter if you pay with bitcoin or with other currencies.
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:38:21
I don't think Bitcoin is the problem. Fossil fuels are the real problem. After implementing a global tax on carbon emissions Bitcoin mining will rapidly shift to renewable energy sources and will no longer be a problem.

Windows is proprietary software with no public source code available. As such, it is always unsecure because it cannot be audited by third-parties. GNU/Linux is way better because it's free software, and source code is available.
