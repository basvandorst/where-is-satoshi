Was looking for somewhere to have a bit of lunch with the wife, and spotted this burger joint with a big Bitcoin sticker on the door. 
I thought 'why not' as I've got a tiny amount in a wallet from tips and other stuff. 
It was the first time the waitress had done it too. 
She just tapped the price into her ipad, I scanned it, job done. Easier than cash as there was no pissing about with change. Only a couple more steps than using ApplePay which is normally my go to. 
Really impressed, especially considering last year I tried to send some btc to a buddy and it took three weeks. 
EDIT: I keep getting asked the same questions. Here are the answers:
• It’s in Mile End, East London. A place called Teaze Burger Joint, just next to Stepney Green tube. 
• I use Bread Wallet on iPhone. 
• I don’t know who their processor is. 
• It wasn’t Lightning as far as I know. 
• No, they didn’t wait for confirmation, but looking at the transaction it confirmed before I got the food anyway. 4 minutes. 
• Yes, those are beans. It was an English breakfast burger. It also had mushrooms, an egg, a sausage, a hash brown, and bacon, as well as the usual burger bits. 
• It was delicious. 
• The £23 includes my wife’s food too, as well as drinks and a starter. 
• Yes, it probably will end up to be the most expensive meal I’ve ever bought. 
• No regrets. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:36:47
It's about $30, but it was for two burgers, drinks, and a starter.

Have you continued buying things with it since, or was it just this one meal?

It was a full English in a burger. Egg, mushrooms, sausage, bacon... beans.

It was a special full English breakfast burger.

Two burgers, drinks, and a starter.

It popped up on her ipad as 'sent' as soon as I scanned it, which she accepted, but it didn't confirm straight away. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 16:13:29
English breakfast... good. 
Burger... good. 
English breakfast burger... amazing. 
Tell me again who's weird.

It was a good burger.

Nope, although looking at the transaction it happened in 4 minutes anyway. 
I don't know who the processor was.
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:44:51
Lunch for two with drinks and a starter. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:05:11
Ah, right. I thought it all tallied up when a shop closed the ledger at the end of the day or whatever. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:10:32
We do, but they’re not as good as baked beans. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:35:35
I didn't ask about lightning as she didn't seem to know exactly what it all was, to be fair... neither do I, not enough to have a conversation about it. 
As soon as I scanned it, the transaction registered on her ipad immediately, but the BTC wasn't confirmed straight away. Looking at the transaction it took 4 minutes, so I'm guessing not Lightning as that would have been at the end of the day, right?
The restaurant is called [Teaze Burger Joint]( I highly recommend it. The food was great, my burger was called the Sleepy Headz, essentially a full English breakfast in a burger. The staff were smiley and happy too. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:14:45
I’ve acquired most of my bitcoin, it’s not a lot, but yes that’s something I should probably do. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:21:58
No. £23 was two burgers, drinks, and a starter. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:15:38
The actual price was £23. By the time I opened the app to pay it had dropped 2 pence. 
The waitress said they add 10% on for bitcoin, I told her not to worry as it could drop or rise by 50% at any given moment anyway. We joked that it will probably turn out to be the most expensive burger I've ever bought. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:05:55
Why should Lightning payments be less easy?

You can look at my phone as much as you like, the same as any other object I have in my possession... physically. 
The moment you try and see what's on my phone that's searching the contents of other computers *not* on my person and should be subject to a warrant. 
I don't agree to you searching my house if you search my car, why should this be any different.

Read through the thread again, bust substitute Bitcoin for 'gay marriage'. The parallels are hilarious. 
Seriously, these ignorant people are so against it that they don't want *anyone* using it. 
There are a few "If you don't want to use it, don't use it, but it would be good to have as an option." posts.  
But no, "it's a 'hacker's paradise!"
@_date: 2016-05-04 10:06:01
No, you'd double space between sentences, and tab at the beginning of a paragraph. 
It's all redundant now.

It's easily spoofed, but not worth it as most coins are claimed. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 09:41:59
I checked about ten, and most of them were already claimed.

You can charge anyone at any point with a crime. It means nothing. Then you can build a case. 
In the UK the Crown Prosecution Service will then decide whether there is enough evidence to take it to court. A role I think is done by the DA's office in America. 
Do you really think that  if there was any evidence that he was responsible for a murder that he wouldn't have been prosecuted for it? 
You know, a body or something would have been handy. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:14:21
Well shit. I never saw it. I must have been watching it on the way back up. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 11:12:26
Yeah, I gave spoofing a go to see if it worked. 
If you drop some Bitcoin, make sure you require a local question to be answered before its picked-up, else people will just spoof and take it. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:23:59
Patents don't protect ideas they protect realisations of ideas. 
Two people can have the same idea and execute them in different ways. Patents protect the way.

I was really interested in these when they were announced, until I found out the price. 
Why on earth would someone buy one of these over a BFL unit which isn't much more?!

Right, that makes sense. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 22:08:52
This is a great idea. The Joomla community is massive, there are millions of Joomla sites, I've built loads myself, and making a component that makes bitcoin easily integrated could give a massive boost to take-up.

Earlier this year I sat there waiting to buy after the bubble and said I would if it dropped to $70. It never did. It got close, but I was stubborn. 
Fuck you, past me. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:20:12


What?! That's the very foundation of the legal system. Innocent until *proven* guilty. 
Do you think that if there were enough evidence that he *wouldn't* have been prosecuted for those crimes? 
The prosecution would have been laughing with glee if they'd had any evidence of people being killed. 
You can be charged with anything, it's the evidence in court that proves or disproves your innocence. 
It's ridiculously silly to believe that he had anything to do with any killings because there clearly isn't any evidence for it. 
EDIT: derp.

Copyrights and patents are essentially the same thing. A patent protects a physical object, an engineering solution. A copyright protects an 'artistic' solution, the written word, images, etc. 
You can't copyright: "erm... flying unicorns in space get taken hostage by space thingys, erm... goblins from Pluto and have to escape and find their way home, and it can be, like, seven books. We'll make a fortune, just like Rowling!"
You can, however, copyright a well-written (or a poorly-written) story about space unicorns escaping pluto and finding their way home. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:20:34
Just the tip. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 07:48:17
Another interesting fact about 419 scams is that they're deliberately riddled with spelling errors and grammatical mistakes as that also helps identify the idiots. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:30:33
Which also means more publicity for bitcoin, no?
