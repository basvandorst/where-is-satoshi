So I'm still *very* new to the whole mining process, but doesn't this mean the end to us low-level amateur college miners just using spare GPU power while we're in class to pick up some beer money?
I mean, when these come out the mining difficulty increases drastically, lowering payout-per-megahash, making GPU mining earn so little it's no longer worth bothering with, right?
As it is I'm only making about 0.018 BTC a day with about 340 Mhash/s. Once these make it to consumers, won't it pretty much force everyone to buy one?

I'm confused as to what you mean. 0_o
Right now, mining at about 0.018 BTC/day at the last Mt.Gox price I saw (about $122) I'm earning about $2.20/day. Considering I'm not using dedicated hardware (just using my gaming GPUs) and have no electricity costs (I live in a dormitory) it's not a bad deal (sure, $14/week isn't going to make me rich but it's certainly nice for a broke college kid considering it's essentially "free" income).
Using some EXTREMELY crude numbers, let's say these new ASICs mine at 10 times the rate I do. If everyone gets them, that makes my mining worth 1/10th what it is now, right? That's $1.40/week. That's roughly the equivalent of working 10 minutes at a minimum-wage job.
So I guess what I'm saying is that it seems to me the release of affordable ASIC-based mining means the end of GPU mining, thus the end of small-time amateur miners like myself.
Are you implying that somehow the release of ASIC mining will cause BTC values to increase dramatically, thus making my small-time amateur mining operation still worth the effort? I don't really see how that's possible. Then again, I'm no economist...I'm just a student who loves dark beer but can't afford it.

Ah, I understand what you meant now. Thank you for the clarification. Certainly some interesting things for me to think about for the future.
And it is important to remember this is all speculative. One demo unit is no guarantee everyone and their mother will have one by May.
