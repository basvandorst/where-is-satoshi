Awesome!! Great to hear. Thanks for the good work.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:45:54
Yes, you are right. Now this would be possible with the hologramles cards. We have to think about it.

Hi Billistix. The system we developed and use to produce the cards is not able to save anything. It has no permanent writable storage. Greetings from Leipzig, Carsten.

Hi Gary, Currently it seems that only some Apple-Cameras having problems reading the Gen I card QR-Code. The code seem to be to small for the camera, so the camera can not focus properly. The new QR-Codes are four times larger then the old ones (144mm² vs. 484mm²) but only enlarge the QR-Code, was not a good solution. The QR code would have hidden a large part of the background image. Therefore, we decided to generate a algorithm to render the QR-Code into the image. Now we have both a visible background image and a large QR-Code.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:44:29

Yes. Please make some suggestions for "encrypted private key", "intermediate code" or "confirmation code".
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:05:24
Yes you are right. I have to create different ones, with less details.

No, there isn't. But I will provide the EPS.

No, can use the tool offline. Further options are to use the programs [provided by Casascius]( ([The source code can be found on github]( or [our own tool]( ([The source code can be found on github]( which is based on Casascius' program.

Wir hatten das bisher immer ausgeschlossen. Aber jetzt wäre das tatsächlich bei den Karten ohne Hologramm möglich. Wir werden es auf jeden Fall in unsere Liste aufnehmen.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:58:36
For this reason and for the people which don't trust us, we provide the BIP 0038 protected Wallet-Card.

No, the intermediate code contains a lot of entropy and we add another bunch with some hardware random number generators.

Yes. Custom backgrounds at Wallet-Cards or Encrypted-Cards. Another way is to design the complete card by yourself.

Why do you think its wring in princible?
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:48:57
The main reasons are:
1. customs/duty it is not allowed us to send topped up cards
2. we don't want to store any card-data (in this case Bitcoin address)
3. the German law prohibits storing money from another person without a specific license

If we leave off the hologram then it would be a one-factor-wallet-card. If a person had a picture of the wallet-card, they only needed the pass phrase to get the btc. If the hologram is intact nobody can get the btc.

Thanks for the hint. Of course, it should be SSL encrypted. So far we have not thought of it. But we will change that soon.

No. On the card you can find a confirmation code. Type the confirmation code and your pass phrase into one of the apps listed on our page (the same apps wich generate the intermediate code). The app will show you whether the the codes belong together an what is the resulting Bitcoin address.

@_date: 2013-09-21 04:52:15
You don't need the blockchain.info app. Public and private key can be imported in nearly every wallet app. If the private key is encrypted you have to decrypt it. This is possible with several sites and apps. I don't know wich wallet apps have the possibility to import encrypted private keys directly. But I will try to contact the authors of the wallet apps to ask them intigrating that.

Yes, you are right. For this reason there is a QR-Code AND a human readable version of the private key covered by the hologram. 
If we leave off the hologram then it would be a one-factor-wallet-card. If a person had a picture of the wallet-card, they only needed the pass phrase to get the btc. If the hologram is intact nobody can get the btc.

On the real cards the "verficiation link" and the bitcoin address is NOT the same. The "verficiation link" points to a website that shows the current balance, as you have believed.
@_date: 2013-09-20 16:00:11
What do you mean with "a custom public key"?
@_date: 2013-07-22 19:55:32
Sounds interesting. Please write to me when you're done. Then I can look at it.

Good point. 
@_date: 2013-09-21 20:42:17
Technically it's not possible to print something else under the hologram except the private key. The software that controls the system is not able to do that.
@_date: 2013-07-23 10:22:55
Great idea. We should do this with PGP. We could create a private PGP-Key on the offline system and share the public key to our customers. What do you think about it?

Hi, Carsten from Bit-Card.de here. I don't know if we're a serious Merchant. Anyway, we use BitPay since a while, and we're fine with that. We don't have to use the service because we don't convert the BTC in a local currency. We use it only as an simple payment processor and they doing it well.
