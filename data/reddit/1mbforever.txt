August 2010. New software version caused a hard blockchain fork with majority support. Emergency software update compatible with original chain overtook the bad software, causing the first blockchain to overcome it the next day.
Not zero. Not One. Bitcoin has had two hard forks. If there is any argument, it's that there have been three. The August 2010 event wasn't only a single hardfork, it was two. One to the new blockchain, and another back to the original.

It's cypherpunks. Signing up for a mailing list doesn't make you one, either.


As opposed to a private company funded by giant corporate VC's? Keep throwing stones in that glass house of yours...

If you were unaware, the people paying your salary aren't Catholics, LJ. 
They are into alternative religions, gathering around icons like [the Owl of Minerva.](
Catholicism is a proletariat religion, and not one for kings and queens, so this is understandable. I hear it is lonely at the top.

So the hardfork never happened because enough people switched back in an emergency after the hardfork happened? Yeah, that's insane. 
The only reason you take this position is because it makes hard forks scary, and justifies your stance on never increasing the blocksize, because increasing the blocksize requires a hard fork.

So the hard fork never happened? This is no different than the DAO fork, except the new Ethereum had ongoing support. If everyone stopped mining the new Ethereum tomorrow and went back to Ethereum classic, would we pretend the DAO fork never happened? That's completely insane. Stop gaslighting and trying to revise Bitcoin's history.

Order book depth are promises, volume is completed trades. Order book depth can be spoofed by anyone with funds on the exchange by placing limit orders at rates above/below market and pulling them before they are filled. Both can be spoofed when the exchange itself falsifies trades, or takes away all cost for others to trade.

A soft fork is backwards compatible. A hard fork is not, and will create a new blockchain either immediately, or when it violates the consensus rules of the previous protocol.
The value overflow incident software caused [53 blocks to be orphaned.](
How does a backwards compatible soft fork create a separate blockchain with 53 blocks mined on it that is later orphaned when emergency software orphans those blocks?
That's a hard fork. Two of them technically. One to the new blockchain for 53 blocks, and then another back to the original chain.
Repeating a lie doesn't make it true, and publicizing the fact that you are a core developer doesn't make you right. Stop spreading misinformation.

Maybe we should raise the max_block_size?

Exchanges don't "lock the order book" when a trade is placed. Only orders that are part of that specific trade are locked. Do you have any experience building or managing exchange systems?
