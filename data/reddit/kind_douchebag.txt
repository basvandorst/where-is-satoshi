There is so much wrong with this post.


This is incorrect as it would only work against pools that use the Pay Per Share payout method.  Since pool operators don't like risk and block witholding attacks, so they use payout methods which insulate them.  Ghash.io uses Pay Per Last N Shares with Groups.  I won't go into the details, but it essentially shifts the luck over to the miners instead of the pool simply pre-paying for shares (as with PPS).  So, if you have 1% of the pool's power, and you never submit blocks, **everyone** at the pool makes 1% less.  Also, the pool would eventually notice and ban you.


Just switch to another pool.  Also, making a client that can do a block withholding attack is trivial.  The fact that nobody has done it and publicized it is because it's a stupid fucking idea.  It's so easy, anyone with any shred of programming knowledge could do it.  Witholding code in bold.
if (greaterThanShareDiff(shareHash) **&amp;&amp; !greaterThanNetworkDiff(shareHash)**) {
    submitShare(job, nonce, timestamp);

Anyone that knows anything about chips will see this as suspect.  It doesn't matter if he has a good track record, he can still just put down the lower bound of their power usage and "forget" to include the upper bound.
Everyone seems to love sucking his dick so much they won't give a shit when he comes out saying "oh hey guys it actually consumes 3x the power I originally said it would".

More than double the difficulty?  Use 4x at the minimum.  The difficulty has been doubling every month, I don't see any reason for it to slow down.  
That puts you at 12 weeks to ROI, but have you even considered the fact that difficulty will be doubling every month while you are mining?
If you don't pay for at least half of the rig in the first month you will never break even.

True, but a smaller die width will use less power per clock granted they use the same gates and the same material.
All I'm saying is that if their 40 nm chip really uses half the power as a 28 nm one, then it basically makes KNC Miner's design team look like idiots.  I don't think they're idiots.  Therefore it is fishy.

Yes, but it only takes one big double spend for them to be found out.  They get one shot and they are toast.  Once they blow their cover, their market share will drop well below what would make them a 51% attack risk.

It helps the network by keeping block size down and avoiding transaction pollution.  Right now, there is a minimum transaction size that will even be considered for acceptance.  That minimum is not present on the Coinbase subnetwork.  There are no fees to send between Coinbase customers, and transactions are actually instant.
You do have to trust Coinbase, but that's the price one pays for those features.  I trust Coinbase more than I trust Visa, plus their fee structure is actually fair.
The only thing Coinbase doesn't help the network is boost the number of Bitcoin transactions shown on Blockchain.info.  While that number is one measure of network acceptance, it's is hardly an accurate one.

The growth won't stop until Bitcoin mining ASICs catch up with the die width used in high performance general purpose processors.  Right now 10nm is the target to hit, and the growth rate won't slow until someone can keep a 10nm ASIC in stock.
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:06:52
Not for long.  Right now the maximum block size is 1 MB which only leaves room for about 1000 - 2000 transactions per block.  
When there are more than that many transactions per block, miners will stop including transactions with no fee.  By that time, most users will use a proxy blockchain like Coinbase's.  When you send coins from a Coinbase user to another Coinbase user, it doesn't push a real transaction on the blockchain.  Coinbase just adjusts its ledger.
In the future, the Blockchain will likely only be used for big transactions or for settling between accounts.
Edit: But wait, there's more!
As more companies start to do this, they will start to interconnect so you can make instant transactions between Coinbase and other companies, not just between Coinbase customers.  
One of the major arguments against Bitcoin that actually has any merit is the lack of consumer protection.  Companies like this could offer consumer protections, like chargebacks.  This could make Bitcoin more mainstream as people who are turned off by the irreversible transactions would no longer have that reason to not like Bitcoin.  But, if you don't like chargebacks, don't use the company that does it.

No, apparently you slightly alter the OP codes without modifying the signed portion.  The tx hash includes the op codes, so the resulting tx does exactly the same thing but has a different hash.
Someone is running a bot that looks for new transactions, modifies the OP codes, and resubmits them.  Some of the modified transactions get put in the blockchain before the original transaction which causes a problem for the clients that use the tx hash to verify that a transaction has been included in the blockchain.

Fuck that guy.
To buy or sell bitcoin, you can use Coinbase.com if you're in the US, or Bitstamp.  Coinbase has a stellar reputation and $25MM in VC funding.  Bitstamp has just been around and dependable for a while.  When people stopped trusting Gox, they fell back on Bitstamp and they took it in stride.
The point that guy is clumsily trying to make is that centralized Bitcoin services are more prone to collapse than fiat services because there is less regulation and Bitcoin is moderately anonymous.
To securely store bitcoin you should look into Armory or Electrum to set up an encrypted wallet **on a non-Windows computer**.  We are still in the early adopter phase, so being secure on your own does require some tech knowledge and patience.
Coinbase also offers merchant services and a web wallet.  If you're just dealing with amounts under $2000 you can use their wallet.  You can sign up as a merchant with them and accept bitcoins at your store and have them instantly converted into USD and deposited in your bank account.  Blockchain.info also offers a lovely web wallet.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Hitting the big red mining button is what you did.  Download the bitcoin client, run it, and it automatically mined with your CPU.

Yes.  The trick that people used on Mt. Gox is that once you get the coins, say that you didn't get any because the original tx was not confirmed.  Then you manually request another payment.

Does anyone else believe their power estimates?  KNC miner used a 28 nm chip, which in general should be around twice as efficient as a 40 nm chip.  
According to mining.thegenesisblock.com, KNC Miner's Jupiter consumes 1.6 W per GH/s.  
ASIC Miner's gen 3 supposedly consumes 0.35 W per GH/s, but that's just the chip.  Let's just call it 0.7 W per GH/s to take into account all of the other shit on the board.
Taking into account the increased power usage when it's on a board, and the differences between the dies, that means ASIC Miner has a design which is more than 4 times as efficient as KNC Miner's.
If anyone has more knowledge about chips than me (not that hard), I'd appreciate it if you would step in a correct my estimates and explain to me how that's even possible.

Yeah, those aren't that great of examples.  Here are some decent retorts that people are going to throw at you:
-You're driving down the highway far away from home, and run out of gas. So you go to the gas station, and put in your card, but it keeps getting rejected. You're stranded away from home, with no access to your money.
Very few places accept bitcoin, so you probably wouldn't be able to use it anyway.  Also, bitcoin doesn't help you be more organized.  It's just as easy to run out of bitcoin as it is to run out of credit.
-A store you frequent recently had customer credit card information stolen. The number of affected people is in the 10,000's, and there are more reports every day. You look in your bank account, and notice fraudulent charges.
So report the fraud to your CC company and they will cancel the card, reverse the charges, and send you a new one.  
-You're out to eat with some friends, and decided to split the bill. When the bill comes, you check your wallet, and realize you have no cash. There's no ATM around, and you need to get your friend money to pay for food.
Ask your server to split the bill on your CC's.  
example is perfect.  To add to it, note that the transfer happens nearly instantaneously, and she can do it at 4 in the morning from her bedroom if she wants.  No need to go to the store or bank and pay a 3rd party to use their service.
Good luck!

I'm going to reply to both of your comments at once.


Yes it's difficult, but Mt. Gox's incompetence has been shown time and time again.  
They wrote and operated an exchange that could only handle 7 trades per second.  It was trivial to exploit.  You could easily dump hundreds of database modifying actions with a single action from their web interface.  You didn't even need a bot.
The transaction malleability bug was even worse.  People could withdraw BTC from their account multiple times.  They didn't even think to check to see if the original outputs had been spent before blindly sending out more BTC.
They were the biggest exchange for over 2 years and made buckets of money as a result.  They had plenty of time to get it together.  These kind of issues are the results of crappy code.


This is not quick.  We've seen Mt. Gox screw up time and time again.  It is not the inevitable result of operating in a difficult space.  It is the inevitable result of operating in a difficult space while being completely incompetent.
I agree with you about Shrem though.  He seems to be a good guy who got tied up with the wrong people.

AngryWriter sums this up nicely:




If they come out with a 110nm product, they will be late, and just as inefficient as everyone else.  The only thing they could possibly bring to the table is a greater supply.  If they really wanted to differentiate themselves and make a ton of money, they would just go ahead with 28.  
I could see going with 68nm to get some cashflow, so their product wouldn't be completely obsolete by the time it hit the market, but saying they're doing 110 is a big raging clue that they don't know what they're doing.

I do think there are some non-luck based reasons to buy a miner.  For example, if you think KNC is going to have production issues, hashfast and cointerra are going to either fail or delay a few months, it does make sense to buy some miners.
Also, ASIC manufacturers probably paid a lot less for the devices than they are selling them for, so they have a better chance of breaking even.
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:17:37
Unlike what you may think, this likely has nothing to do with how your clock was set.
A block has a valid timestamp if the time is strictly greater than the median of the timestamps of the last 11 blocks, and less than or equal to 2 hours in the future (time based on the median of the current times reported by nearby nodes).  
People can set the time in the past so they can have more timestamp to roll when mining.  
This is useful because you can make a single piece of work last for much longer than just the 2^32 hashes you get from the nonce.

Np, I enjoy discussion.
Perhaps this might work:
Make a ton of keys.  Store only public keys on the server.  The server serves out your webpage (with embedded public keys I'm assuming), and monitors transactions to see when payments are issued to any of the addresses of interest.  Your personal computer has the private keys, and also monitors transactions to see when payments are issued.  Your script runs on your personal computer, taking actions based on the transactions it sees over the network.

Depends on the logic of their pool software.  But seriously, don't do that.  Those 34 MB would be a burden that the entire Bitcoin using world must carry.  Every single computer that keeps a full log of the blockchain is going to carry around your stupid 34 MB because you wanted 1M addresses with 100 satoshis each.  Are you that selfish?
Also, what's the point?  You can't even (easily) spend from one of those addresses.  Nodes refuse to relay transactions that carry less than 5430 satoshis, so in order to spend from any of them, you have to get at least 55 of them together.    Or, if you solo mine blocks yourself you can mine a block with your stupid transaction included in it.
Edit: Tired and thought 34 MB was 34 KB.  1 MB block limit, duh.

GPU's work fine for script, but luke can't just point the firehose of hash power directly at the pool.  Pools do not provide a mining client to users, they just provide the work.

You seem to assume that all miners reach unprofitability at the same time.  This could not be further from the truth.  Different ASIC devices differ in efficiency and since electricity is their main cost, it is extremely important.  Cointerra claims to be producing a chip that can do 1 GH/s using only 0.6W, whereas ASICMiner's chips need about 12W to complete the same number of hashes.
Also, electricity prices vary throughout the country.  The average price is $.13 per kWh, but in Quincy, WA the price is $.024 per kWh.  Therefore, a miner in Quincy will run longer than anywhere else.
All this means that as the processing power increases, and the BTC price stays the same, the miners with crappy shit will turn off their equipment while the ones with efficient shit will keep running.
Edit: Wording
@_date: 2013-08-22 19:56:35

The issue is enforcement, and I think that's where we will just have to agree to disagree.  I believe a properly functioning government should strike a balance between liberty and safety.  If it does not infringe on the liberty of law abiding citizens, laws should be in place to punish wrongdoing.  
In the divorce case, the crime *is* hiding it, because without money-laundering laws, there is no possible way of catching the guy.  All you know is that money disappeared.  It's *very convenient* that this happened right before the divorce, but there is no way to prove it, so the crime of having what belongs to her does not matter.
Edit:  Also, one more thing.  From a moderate to an anarchist: If you find yourself explaining Bitcoin to a non-anarchist, do not bring up the fact that you can use it to evade taxes, buy drugs, or (possibly but probably not) hire hitmen.

Bitcoin is quantum resistant.  A quantum computer can find your private key given your public key, but your public key isn't revealed until you spend from an address.  So, if you only spend from an address once, and use a fresh change address, you're safe from quantum computing attacks.
Also, it is trivial to make a quantum computer to find private keys from public keys compared to making a quantum computer that solves blocks.  You would have to have enough qubits to store the entire merkle tree for it to be remotely useful.

You guys are idiots.  You really think someone with that much to lose did this?
Lets assume they have 100k BTC.  The value of their assets dropped from $26M to $7.5M
"But they probably just sold at the top and did it so they could buy back more!"  Fair enough, they could have done that, but it seems to me that they are Bitcoin "true believers."  $1B market cap isn't cool, $1T is.  Nobody buys 100k BTC and then shits on it, they buy 100k BTC because they expect that in 5 years 1 Bitcoin will be worth more than $1000.
"But they probably just sold at the top and did it so they could buy back more and wanted to pop the bubble before it got bigger so that it would stop getting so much stupid media attention so Bitcoiners could stop being so greedy and focus on fundamentals!"  Take off your tinfoil hat.

By that same logic, buying stock in a company that then makes it big is also a legal Ponzi scheme.
Before you pop a blood vessel in your brain, consider that new investments into Bitcoin don't necessarily increase the value of earlier investments.  If it's a bad news day, or people just start losing faith in the economy, the price can go down depreciating the value of everybody's investments, even with lots of money pouring in.
The difference is that a Ponzi scheme is a big pool of money that keeps its cover by paying out to those who request payouts with new investor money.  At some point, the operator(s) pull the plug, and gtfo.  
Bitcoin's rate of returns have been so high, not because it is a Ponzi scheme, but because it is risky and unpredictable as fuck.

I realize the guy just wanted a Paypal alternative.

Thanks for doing this.  I have a couple thoughts.
About number 5:  That is quite possible if one encrypts it with a weak or easily guessable password.
15 seems a bit unlikely, but it is a good to remember that if you are using some obscure software to store your wallet, you need both the wallet and the software.
About the things you've thought about:  All good thoughts.  I think keyloggers are the biggest threat if you are using an online service to store your coins.  Viruses or Trojans are the biggest threat if you are handling your wallet on your own computer.  
Please add:  USE 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION IF AVAILABLE!

Because explaining mining in depth is extremely complicated.  Even explaining it to another software dev is difficult.  There are much more interesting things about Bitcoin than mining protocol.

I see what you're getting at, the issue with a deflationary currency is not that people won't spend it, but that people won't invest it.  Individual spending is not what drives the economy.
But you cannot say that Bitcoin does not have utility.  It's basically gold but easier to store securely and can be sent anywhere in the world for next to nothing.
The Blockchain also acts as an indelible public ledger which can be used for proof of ownership of anything.
I agree that Bitcoin cannot replace inflationary currencies, but it excels as a store of wealth and a medium of transfer (once the markets are more stable and liquid).

There's also a chance that due to Quantum Tunneling you will teleport through a brick wall and reappear unharmed on the other side.  The chance is so low that people don't worry about it.
The same goes for Bitcoin Addresses, the chance is so small that people don't worry about it.  If you still insist that because the chance is non-zero that it is an issue, you simply cannot grasp how unbelievably large 2^80 really is.

You are right, the difficulty just means less than a target number.  However, the effects are much more pronounced when you are using decimal.

The software favors the chain with the longest length, so the chain within the country would be completely abandoned.  Also, the difficulty remains the same while they are cut off, so assuming they have 1% of the network hash rate inside the country there would be a bit less than 1 block per day.  
Basically people would be relying on 0 confirmation transactions the entire time, because once the network comes back any blocks that were mined will be orphaned.  The transactions sent could be incorporated into the main chain, but it would be really easy to attempt double spends.

I agree with your analysis on your assumed information, but none of this is correct.
Coinlab essentially operated an **80%** PPS pool which paid earnings in the your free-to-play-game currency of choice based on your BTC earnings/fiat exchange rate/ftp currency exchange rate.  They offered a client which was trivial to install (mostly), and started you mining.
Then, they operated a 95% PPS pool (Protected Pool) which offered miners "loyalty points".  Every share you submitted would get you 1 loyalty point.  Basically they set a fixed price on 1 GH/s/day of $2.50.  So, when ASICs come and destroy your GPU earnings, you can still make decent money.  This seems like a really good deal for miners, and an awful one for Coinlab.  Well, it was, but the hope was that they would be able to find non-Bitcoin computing jobs (protein folding, seismic analyzing, etc...) to make use of the GPU's once they could no longer be useful for Bitcoin mining.  They hired Con (CG Miner) to write a new client which could take an arbitrary compute client so that it could work on various types of compute jobs.
I'm not sure what happened to the alternative computing project, but I know they took the loss on loyalty points and paid them out.

It's not nuts, but it's not completely secure.
If your computer was infected before creating the wallet, it could record the unencrypted version, and send it elsewhere.  Even if you took the computer offline to do the generation, it could have saved it, and waited for a connection to send it off.
Also, deleting a file doesn't really delete it, it just removes your operating system's reference to it.  Malware could scan your hard drive, looking for something that looks like an armory wallet, and if your computer has not overwritten that portion, it is still sitting there.

That's not really how mining works.  Here's a simplified version which should answer your question.
When trying to find the next block, each miner looks at the pool of unconfirmed transactions, these are transactions that are submitted, valid, and have not been added to any block yet.  They then pick a bunch of them, and hash them all together to produce a merkel root which is essentially the signature of that group of transactions.  It is in their best interest to include as many transactions as possible, because most of them have fees attached to them, and when they solve a block, they receive those fees on top of the block reward (25 bitcoins right now).
Does this answer your question?
@_date: 2013-10-01 20:53:01
Oh Boy!  That card will get you about 110 MH/s.  This calculator shows that you will get about 4 cents per day!
But wait, there's more!
Because companies are releasing ASIC devices which are about a thousand times faster and more efficient than your graphics card, the difficulty to mine Bitcoins is increasing exponentially!  This means your earnings will be cut in half every month!
So, the solution is to use a calculator which takes into account the increasing difficulty.  This link here shows that if you leave your computer mining 24/7 for one year you will make $3.22.  TOTAL.  EVER.

The fact that the price bounced back 2 days after the fork scare means that Bitcoin is not overbought.  From your tone I don't suppose you've bought any Bitcoins on Coinbase recently, but you can only do it in the mornings due to Coinbase hitting their withdraw limit.  People just can't get their USD into Bitcoin fast enough.  
There are hundreds of thousands of dollars in the clenched fists of people swearing at their fucking computers because they can't get enough.  When Coinbase (and others) can catch up, expect the price to rise.

Most of your concerns seem to assume that there will be no more Bitcoin businesses started, and no more development on the protocol or open source 3rd party tools.
Businesses will make Bitcoin accessible to the masses.  
Businesses will have instant off-chain transactions done internally, and the main chain will only be used for withdrawals and rich paranoid anarchists.  This solves the confirmation time issue for day to day transactions, and will greatly assist with the block size issue.  Hint: Coinbase already has this service.
A business could decide to implement an off-transaction service, but also allow for chargebacks.  This would be more consumer-friendly, like credit cards, and build trust with the masses.
I don't think BTC will replace fiat either, but I think it will see a few orders of magnitude more usage than today.

The "something like that" is actually the timestamp that the miner solved the block with.  Most pools and miners set the timestamp initially to the median time of all the nodes they are connected to.  Then, miners are allowed to increment (roll) the timestamp in order to get a fresh nonce to work through thereby increasing the amount of work they can do before needing to request new work.
This probably happened because the block 19 minutes ago solved it with a timestamp rolled into the future.  The block 20 minute ago quickly solved the next block with a timestamp at the current time.
It would be nice if blockchain.info used the time they received it instead of the timestamp in the block.

Actually someone did some analysis on the extranonce values of blocks mined from inception.  
He assumes (safely in my opinion) that Satoshi was one of the biggest miners for the first few years, and noted that his client left a certain signature due to the fact that he mined the first block and his miner was consistently restarted every 100 hours (presumably to back up the wallet).
This is not guaranteed to be accurate, but it makes sense.

No problem!  There is a lot of shitty new clutter about Bitcoin so it's hard to find quality content.
Also, not saying you don't know, but just in case you don't know: the difficulty re-targeting is usually based only on number of blocks, not on time.  When someone says it happens every 2 weeks, they really mean 2016 blocks (10 min per block * 2016 blocks = 2 weeks).  When someone says 10 minutes they mean 10 minutes on average.  The only exception to this is if there is a massive drop in hash power.  Don't quote me on this, but I believe that if less than 2016 blocks are found in 8 weeks (8 actual weeks in time), the difficulty is automatically re-targeted.

Np, another thing that you can see from the graphs on  is that when the amount of processing power is increasing, the difficulty never catches up.  This means that Bitcoins are being released a bit faster than the intended 10 minutes per block.  
How much faster you say?  Well, I couldn't find a website to quickly give me exact figures, so I eyeballed the graph.  2016 blocks would take 2 weeks exactly if each block took 10 minutes on average.  The last 2016 blocks before the most recent difficulty change took ~12 days, so a lot.

Some minor issues with the article:


Dwolla does not handle Bitcoins, it handles USD.  Mt. Gox is the one who needed to register as a MSB because it transfers customer funds (USD) on behalf of its customers.


While this is mostly true, Mt. Gox is just a small part of the picture.  The one thing Mt. Gox has going for it is that it has the most liquidity of any exchange.  If Mt. Gox goes down, and the liquidity spreads out among all the other exchanges, the ecosystem will be much healthier.

You're still connecting the computer to the internet.  If you've attracted any Bitcoin-literate malware when getting that computer setup (which is possible considering you are downloading Bitcoin software), it can see the unencrypted wallet, and will send it off when you connect it to back up to cloud storage.
You also have two things you need to rely on, paper, and the password to the encrypted file on your cloud storage account.  If you're ok with remembering the password, just use a brain wallet.  If you're ok with the paper, boot from a fresh live linux usb, connect to internet, download armory (or whatever you want to make your keys), disconnect from the internet, print the wallet to your printer directly connected or over lan (with your modem disconnected).

People say the time to 6 confirmations is 1/4 the time as Bitcoins, but 6 confirmations is also 1/4 as secure as 6 Bitcoin confirmations, so it doesn't matter at all.  They changed the algorithm to try to be immune to the GPU switch, but they failed as someone has already come out with an LTC GPU miner.
You're overthinking it.

If someone did this the confidence in the market would be destroyed.  Most would sell off, and almost all transaction volume would halt for fear of double spends.  
In this case, the core devs could change the proof of work function to wipe out the ASICs, and revert everyone back to GPU mining.
If this entity had 1000x the total hashing power of the network in GPUs or FPGAs then I'm not sure what could be done.  The entire basis for issuing Bitcoin is based on proving that you have lots of computing power.  This is very unlikely though, because in order to get 166 PH/s you would need around $132 B worth of 7970's (assuming you could get them for $400 a piece)

Being more intelligent than stupid people does not make you intelligent.  Most 18 year olds are morons.  I was 18 once, and I was a moron.  I still am, but to a lesser degree.  Maybe that's why I'm still here...
Bitcoin has made a lot of people rich, but they were taking a huge risk by investing in Bitcoin when it was unknown.  Now it is known, much less risky (than it was before).  Less risk less reward.  The only people making money off of mining right now either own shares in an ASIC mining company like the aptly named ASICMiner, or are people who have tons of money and influence to dump into purchasing a miner.
Considering the fact that you are 18, your only bet is the former.  Don't expect amazing returns, the market has has lots of time to adjust.  You only make money when you exploit a difference between the market value of something and the actual value.
I don't normally do this, but since we are talking about how intelligent you are:

Absolutely not. It is very very unlikely that any consumer mining machine is going to beat out simply buying Bitcoin.  You have to take into account the fact that you don't have the rig now, and the difficulty is rapidly increasing.  Basically, your returns are getting cut in half every 25 days, and there's not much of a reason that is going to change.  Try using this calculator, it takes into account the rising difficulty and lists the posted availability dates, which you should not count on them hitting: mining.thegenesisblock.com
More analysis:
You could spend $7000 on a rig or $7000 on 10 Bitcoins.  You will not mine 10 Bitcoins on that rig by the time it comes out.
The mining market is soon to be fully saturated.  It's not all BFL anymore, the players are serious professionals, there are a lot of them, and they have tons of capital.
Even if you do manage to make back your initial investment (against BTC), you are barely going to be making any money at all by then, as your earnings are just bumping up against your electricity costs.
With your EXTREMELY HIGH electricity costs, it's not going to be too long before you're going to have to turn your shit off.
Here's a chart of the difficulty: bitcoin.sipa.be.
It's not just EXPONENTIAL, the EXPONENTIAL COEFFICIENT IS INCREASING MFER.  That means YOU WILL LOSE.

This is an issue, but there are fool proof (albeit complicated and not necessarily apocalypse proof) ways to secure coins.
In the future, securing your coins on the raw protocol will be something anyone could do, but few people will.  Storage insured against theft and loss is a valuable service and I think that businesses offering those services will start popping up soon.
Since the target market of those businesses are people who are non-technical, Bitcoin will have to go more mainstream for those people to become more interested.

There are other informative answers here, but they don't cover the fact that you sometimes see empty blocks that only contain the generation transaction (25 BTC reward to the miner).
If a block was very recently solved, and that block included every transaction available there would be no available transactions, so there weren't any transactions to include.
This is not much of an issue anymore (because of ASICS), but people who controlled botnets and used them to mine bitcoins would not include transactions because it would be a big pain to code up.  It could also be that they wanted as little interaction with the internet as possible, so it just does the bare minimum.

Well, let's just start with why 800k isn't enough.  Since this is supposed to last for the rest of your life, we can't make any risky bets with it.  
We'll invest it with some smart people, and get back a safe 5% per year.  That means $40k per year, more than enough to live on granted you are healthy, single, and you keep spending in check.
But, inflation is what gets you.  Every year that $40k is worth less than the year before.  If you're 25 like me, you've got another 50+ years (with medical advances I would not be surprised by a bonus 10-20).  Assuming 3% inflation, in 20 years, that $40k is worth about $22k in today's dollars.  In 50 years it goes about as far as $9k in today's dollars.
This is all assuming that you have no events which force you to dip into your fund.  Get cancer?  Want to have kids?  You're fucked in both cases.
Ok ok, you can reinvest your money if you keep your expenses low.  So, instead of 5%, you have to live on 2% (3% for inflation).  Have fun living on $16k a year.
It's easier if you're old, because you can live off the returns and burn your reserves knowing that you're going to die soon / have social security / kind relatives who will support you.  Also, the inflation factor is not such a big deal.
As a 25 year old, I would consider retiring if I had $4MM, but that's just because I wouldn't retire unless I could afford a fairly cushy lifestyle.

Ugh, that again?  OP wants to know what would happen if there were a major vulnerability.  You wouldn't need to cycle through 2^256 possibilities to get what you want.
Also, this point is moot, but it is important to note that you don't need to go through 2^256 possibilities to spend someone's bitcoins.  The private / public keys are 2^256, and the address is 2^160.  
To spend, you just need to prove that you have a private key whose public key hashes to the address.  This means there are many many correct private keys for every address, so you don't need to find the original private key, just one that works.
2^160 is still fucking huge, so it doesn't matter, but it's good to know how it actually works.

You can send an optional transaction fee right now.  IIRC the standard fee recommended is 0.0001, about 10 cents.  In order for your transaction to confirm, a miner has to include your transaction in their block, and find a winning hash.  Miners are more likely to include your transaction if it has a fee, but you can get away with no fees if you don't mind it taking up to a day to confirm.

The rate that Bitcoins are released sits around 10 minutes per block regardless of how much hashing power is on the network.  If the network hashrate doubles immediately after a difficulty change, that rate will change to 5 minutes per block until the difficulty change, which will happen in 1 week.  After that change, if the hashrate doesn't increase it will be 10 minutes per block.  However, with the constantly increasing hashrate, that number will be ~~closer to 7 minutes~~ just under 10 minutes per block depending on how fast people get machines on the network.
It only depends on what the miners do with the Bitcoin.  It is likely that some ASIC miners will sell some of their coins, but probably only enough to make back their investment.  This is just speculation, but I bet that if you're willing to drop a bunch of cash on an ASIC, you're going to be in it for the long game.  If those people do decide to sell off some coins, it will likely be just enough to cover your investment and electricity costs.

There's a 5-6% spread right there, and that doesn't even take into account how much they will push the market with all that cash.  If they have $1MM on Gox, and they buy up all the BTC they can, their average price is around 114-115.  Then if they want to sell that on CampBX, they'd probably kill the price to $50 because CampBX has almost no liquidity.

That's not what a split is.  A split is literally this: Hey this is a 2:1 split!!  You got 200 share now you got 400, bye!
You may be thinking of what happens when a new investment comes into a company.  When an investor buys a portion of the company, they generally dilute the existing shares, by exchanging their money for brand new shares.  
For example: if the company had 8M shares, and a new company is offering $1M in exchange for 20% of the company, the company now has 10M shares, and the investor owns 2M of them.

A very good thought.  It is quite an interesting question, what do we do with all this heat?  Because everything is so cutting edge, heat is seen as a nuisance--just get that shit out the fucking door before difficulty goes up.  
However, if Bitcoin goes mainstream for realzies, the heat can be of use.  All the asic has to do is offset the increased cost associated with using electricity for heating instead of using fossil fuels, a heat pump, or alternative energy.  Very cold places a good first target.  
Water heaters are another prime candidate.  You would have to be content not running it at full blast all the time because you don't want your water to be 70 C.
A pre-heater for the water used to generate steam in nuclear plants might be useful, but I don't know enough about them to know that for sure.
I could have sworn there were more random uses for spare heat, but I'm drawing a blank right now.

The probability of finding a block follows the poisson distribution.  Here's a calculator:
x (lower case) is the number of blocks found.  If the difficulty is an accurate representation of the network speed, we would expect to find 1 block every 10 minutes, 7 blocks in 70 minutes.  Because the network is increasing faster than the difficulty, lets just call it 8 blocks in 70 minutes.
So, the average rate of success is 8, the number of blocks we should expect to find in 70 minutes.
The result is 0.000335.  This means that there is a 0.0335% chance that for any given 70 minute period there will be 0 blocks found.  Uncommon, but it's bound to happen eventually.

Nobody has explicitly admitted to using a botnet to mine Bitcoin, but there is wide speculation that some of the blocks mined with 0 transations in them were from a botnet operator looking to skirt the technical details of repeatedly sending out new merkel roots as new transactions appeared.  
Sure, infected computers don't have good specs, but botnets can be huge.  A small botnet of 10,000 PCs with a generously small 2 MH/s still nets you 20 GH/s.  At current rates that's $80 per day with little to no upkeep after initial acquisition.

They won't be profitable to buy, but they will still be profitable to run.

Several hundred?  Let's do some math.  Cointerra promises 0.6 Watts per GH/s.  Even if we assume ASICMiner throws down a 14 nm chip at 0.2 Watts per GH/s (really pushing it), that's 20 MW per 100 PH/s.  
To put that in perspective, [the average US home uses around 800 kWh per month.](  100 PH/s would use 14,400,000 kWh per month, or 18000 homes.  Using a conservative 7 cents per kWh (cheap electricity plus priced in hosting costs / AC), that's $1M per month.
Possible, but super ballsy.

The server is an additional point of failure.  Having a server with private keys on it a terrible idea, and is only done if absolutely necessary (A mining pool automating payouts to miners, an exchange automating BTC withdrawls).  I don't see why you can't just store the private keys on an offline computer, and the public keys on the server?
Good security is not really that easy, but it is cheap.  User paper wallets, or a laptop that has never been connected to the internet.  Store your private keys there, and transfer them off for one time use only.  Send the change back to another private key on your offline computer.

So you are accepting coins to the wallet stored on the server, and immediately sending some to multiple other wallets some of which are not controlled by you?
Your pc is no safer than the server.  As long as they are connected to the internet, they are vulnerable, so don't do anything extra based on that assumption.

A quick tidbit from the Bitcoin dev mailing list.  This is my understanding, please correct me if this is incorrect in any way.  
The paper seems to make the assumption that the attacker can always publish a block and have it accepted.  It works like this:
The latest block is called 0.
The attacker finds a block based off of 0, called A1.
Instead of publishing it, the attacker holds onto it, and starts mining for block A2 based off of A1.
An honest miner finds a block based off of 0, called B1, and publishes it.
Now there are 2 chains each with the same height.  The paper assumes that the attacker can consistently publish A1 and have it accepted, orphaning B1.
This assumption would only be true under the following conditions:
1. The honest miner finding the block is very poorly connected, but still sends its block to the attacker's node first or close to first.
2. The attacker is **extremely** well connected, and is able to get its block out to all the big pools and miners before the honest miner's block gets there.
Some background on how the blockchain resolution (currently) works:  A miner always mines on the highest (longest) chain it knows about.  If it knows about two chains with the same height, it continues to mine on the one it heard about first.
This means that if a big miner finds the block (BTC Guild, GHash.io), they will always mine on their own block because there is no propagation time there.  They will ignore the attacker's block unless the attacker has two blocks on their own chain.
Big miners are themselves extremely well connected, especially to each other, in order to reduce orphan rates.
Because the attacker has such a large amount of power, they can mine on their own chain and sometimes get 2 blocks before everyone else.  In that case, they could wait until everyone else got 1 block, and orphan it.  This is annoying, but the attacker will suffer huge losses in order to achieve it.

Everyone saying it would drive the price up are correct, but it would be far cheaper to 51% attack the network.  The NSA has their own ASIC shop, and I'm sure that with their funding and expertise they could virtually eliminate all confidence in the currency.
1. Make 10x the current network hashrate of ASICs (~$10M)
2. Get latest block from the network and mine it offline (include no transations) for 1 month.
3. Turn the servers online
4. Blockchain switches over to the longest chain and the past month's transactions are reversed.
If for some insane reason that doesn't kill it, sell the Bitcoins from the block reward and make 10x what it cost.
This is why it is imperative that people get as much ASIC power online as soon as possible to make this unfeasible.
@_date: 2013-06-18 23:16:22

Waiting an hour for a confirmation can and does happen even now (on average about once per 46 days), even with the processing power constantly increasing.  Look up a Possion or exponential distribution.
Also, you don't necessarily need a confirmation for just a sandwich.  When the transaction is broadcast, it is still very difficult to do a double spend attack (less than 1 percent chance even if executed perfectly).  Even if you did manage to pull one off, it's a pretty risky move for a fucking sandwich.

You are correct on the low side though.  I didn't you were referring to that because if the hash rate is that low, Bitcoins will be worthless.
