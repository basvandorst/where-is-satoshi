I actually do this every time. And every time, I think I've hit it big.

Wow. I'm totally saving that for when I explain bitcoin to people. Way to sum it all up in one sentence!!!!

Very nice!! I remember trying to get these manufactured during my dogecoin days about 4 years ago. I wanted to sell dogecoin gift cards. I Never got round the hurdle of securing the private keys during manufacture though. Is there a way of doing this with bitcoin?

Pretty much, yeah. The odds of 2 computers producing the same address are infinitesimally small

Yeah, I had everything lined up along the same lines as you, but couldn't get around the trust issue because there was the potential risk of the private keys being written down. I did explore the option for people to send in their encrypted private keys, but the cost of a single run was prohibitive (was going to mass produce plastic cards). Thanks for the info and I hope it goes well for you. Those cards are really well made!

Someone explained it better than me on stack exchange:
If there are a million people on the bitcoin network, and they each have a million accounts each, and if you can create 30 peta-accounts per second, generate the public key, and check if that public key has money (30 petahashes is approx the current bitcoin network hashrate, and you would need to hash each key).
In 1.5x10^9 millennia, you have about a 50% chance of getting the same wallet as someone else. Before then, there will be over 27,000 extinction level events - events which will kill over 50% of the life on earth - not counting man-made ones.
