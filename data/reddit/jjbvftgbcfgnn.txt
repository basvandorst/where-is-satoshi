I don't really think the hf will be successful, but I also kindof think it's a conspiracy to demonstrate that bitcoin can't easily be hfd. But maybe it still could be if they actually we're trying rather than just putting on a show.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:49:37
They did. It turned out to be govt agents
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:11:38
Imo bitcoin will never be hfd. It will have to tread a very difficult path to maintain trust. The trust is probably still misplaced though. It's kindof like how the federal reserve was named that so the people will think it was theirs. Similarly bitcoin must be controlled in non obvious ways and really most people have to believe that nobody is in charge at all for it to work.

Fire.com is a good Irish bank. Also bunq.com in the Netherlands.

Those are all terrible domains that they would never use. Probably just defensive registration by some brand dept.

Korean exchanges are just a continuation of the fake Chinese exchanges that were closed.

Maybe you know them under a different name?

Would have cost the same to move 40000 or 4000000.. its for moving large value. Small value can still be BTC denominated, but it will need a second layer network to transfer cheaply.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:28:23
It allows more transactions to be processed. Bitcoin requires a transaction backlog to allow for tx price discovery and to ensure there are always transactions to include if two blocks are found close together (before new transactions are posted)
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:42:58
It's impossible. The only way is if everyone switches to new software and agrees to call the new software bitcoin. That will not happen so you will always have multiple bitcoins. The question is which one will become dominant, the existing one with the huge deployment base and resulting network effect or the new one which can maybe handle a few more transactions.. time will tell.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:12:22
The mining is far more concentrated than that. The Chinese govt could push through a HF on their own if they wanted too. If you want a centralised cryptocurrency the Russians have promised a crypto ruble. I expect they won't bother with mining.. but do you trust the central bank not to inflate? Would it be ok if the IMF did it instead?

No forks needed... And most of it won't be part of your wallet but a separate routing process.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:35:48
RAM is likely to be an issue.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:56:59
You can, but it isn't a good idea. If the seller rips you off when trading outside the escrow LBC can't do anything. Just withdraw to your own wallet after the trade is complete.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:48:58
Transactions don't have any weight. The work to find a block is almost the same no matter how many transactions there are.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:01:25
Use Revolut.com. doesn't avoid international payments but makes them free.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:57:01
Government doesn't care what harm they may do to the miner. They might just shut it down for money laundering, but if not the temptation to use it to push through a hardfork to award the government some free money is too strong. Governments could collude on this if necessary.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:06:58
There will still be fees and full blocks when most are using segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:22:16
Could push savings back to central bank money or the centrally mined HF with the free money for gov clause built in.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:56:33
They can't force anyone to buy them. Eventually people will get bored of them. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:29:19
Large mining outside China won't appear overnight. By the time it was built maybe noone cares anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:42:35
You can do it but when you see the price you won't want too.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:47:28
The last soft fork required was segwit which already happened.

Gdax doesn't take prepaid cards. You could get a USD bank acct in Canada.. some of them have us bank routing codes so maybe could be used with gdax.. of course gdax may not give you that option when you live in Canada.. not sure about that.. but you could link that to your USD PayPal and then use the usd visa debit card.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:48:06
After 2016 blocks yes. If no blocks are getting mined it never happens.

Centralised emoney existed before bitcoin. The companies get attacked by the government for money laundering. It's happened a few times. Digicash, egold, liberty reserve to name a few. Large centralised mining operations can't hide from government. They will order them to do what they want.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:27:04
Every episode is cringy as hell. Imo 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:15:05
Cause you have all your money in BTC and really need to buy something.

Not in the UK 
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:18:24
Maybe transaction fees will be very high.. or mining hardware gets a bit more efficient.. or mining power could decrease or maybe miners will mine at a loss (heating or built into iot stuff). Mining follows the price it doesn't lead it. I'm not sure what will happen, but the decrease of around 2% is much lower than before.. if a few whales sold out their position that year it'd be a wash as far as the supply goes.

Probably too late to do anything now. Just don't let him deposit more.

I always expected 1mb forever and I still think that's likely. Even if there is a successful HF the old chain will continue.

Upgrades (changes) are supposed to be hard. It's a feature. It's actually the main feature.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:56:46
Cause it's exactly the same transaction. Same inputs, outputs and signatures. If there are funds on the inputs on both chains (which there are in a chain split) then the same transaction will work on both chains. The issue is simply that someone sending funds to someone else may not realize they sent funds on some other chain that they might not realise existed.. and maybe the recipient can get more value than the sender intended.
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:56:30
In any harsfork situation, the original chain will continue.. the default then in that the original will retain the name. That makes s2x an altcoin. Maybe one day an altcoin can overtake bitcoin, but there would have to be a damn good reason. Increasing the block size a bit really isn't going to cut it.
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:49:39
Cash deposit on localbitoins.com. Some sellers may take prepaid cards but they will take a large fee.. and still want to see scans of your Id.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:20:20
The issue is likely that you need a ruble bank acct in your own name, and possibly one at a Russian bank (for access to local Russian payment systems). 
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:58:23
Check out bitcoin.de and kraken.com. PayPal is not useful. Use a bank acct.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:43:10
You can probably fence it yourself. Open an eur account in Europe for the bitcoin company.. then start a gold for cash company with cash deposit functionality in the UK. Take the cash from the bitcoin ATM company and use it to buy a gold coin from the gold company. Then sell the gold coin back to the gold company for a euro bank transfer to the bitcoin company's euro account. The two companies just pass the gold coin back and forth, but it isolates the gold company and it's cash deposits from any bitcoin activity.

No. The project was on sourceforge.

Maybe sha256 is starting to break down.. maybe there are fewer low value hashes than there should be.. or maybe too many.

@_date: 2017-10-26 03:06:57
If s2x fails, it may be good for bch. I dunno about huge success, but short term I would expect a price increase. The commitment to low fees means they will likely break the commitment to deflation which makes it unlikely to maintain value in the long term.
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:06:38
It's a bit better than Json RPC. Block chain will be the inter company API.

Sounds like fun, but with so many startup fintech banks already burning VC and no sign of profits I question the business case for yet another one.

Kraken.com, bitstamp.net, coinbase.com or maybe zyado.com and gatecoin.com. just use euros.

I have no doubt he's a scammer.. anyone selling for such a deep discount is almost certainly a scammer, but attempting to buy the listing with not allowed payment methods is just a waste of time and doesn't prove anything. I mean it's like going to a drug dealer you suspect of selling knock-off drugs and then attempting to pay him with bottle caps and him telling you to fuck off.. and then youre like see I told you he was a scammer! It does nothing to address the question of the quality of the drugs.

I think it mostly depends on exchanges.. as long as most of them quote in BTC then thats what we'll use. Maybe everyone will just have to get used to fractional amounts for prices..
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:53:47
Coinbase is mainly an exchange.. might make sense to hold £20 there though.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:59:58
Coinbase bills the cards from outside the us, it probably helps circulate the transaction information amongst various different intelligence agencies.
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:32:51
No. Typically more expensive.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:48:37
Currently about 33% of all BTC that existed before the bch fork have moved on the bch chain since the fork. So I say with confidence less then 2/3rds have been lost.

Use a euro exchange (kraken, bitstamp) with revolut.com or fire.com to cheaply move funds there.

Not really. If there was a certificate for core nodes then btc1 could just copy it.

I expect he was a scammer, but this video fails to demonstrate it. The guy violates the terms of the trade attempting to buy using a different payment method and the seller cancels the trade. Waste of 5min.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:08:38
He obviously won't keep it. The problem is the Japanese govt will tax his windfall and then there is less to give back.

You can't avoid receiving BTC, but the utxo model means that the received funds aren't immediately mixed with your other utxos, so if you are careful you could just never spend the unwanted payment.. just ignore it and leave it there forever.

2hr blocks will suck, but as long as it's continuing to advance the chain other miners will switch back.
