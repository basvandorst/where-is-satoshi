What you've described makes BC the perfect asset bubble,  not the perfect currency.  Every time I come here,  I get down voted by armchair economists who think their pocket full of BC are going to be worth billions,  and that BC is going to take over the world.  I shake my head.  Deflation is the *worst-possible-scenario* for a currency.  It discourages use.  Please do your research before trotting this fallacy about.   . 
@_date: 2012-01-10 05:33:40
Deflation has always been the biggest long term issue with BC.  I see no way around it.  It's a structural problem built into the whole system.  It discourages people to use it as a currency,  and encourages people to use it as a speculative vehicle .

Decreasing nominal prices for goods and services
Increasing buying power of cash money and all assets denominated in cash terms
May decrease investment and lending if cash holdings are seen as preferable (aka hoarding)
Harms debtors whose original debt remains fixed even as their income and value falls — for example, a house ends up "underwater", even as the owner's income falls too much to even keep up payments[17]
Benefits recipients of fixed incomes
Deflation was present during most economic depressions in US history[18] Deflation is generally regarded negatively, as it causes a transfer of wealth from borrowers and holders of illiquid assets, to the benefit of savers and of holders of liquid assets and currency, and because confused pricing signals[citation needed] cause malinvestment, in the form of under-investment.

@_date: 2012-01-10 17:53:00
No,  again this is a fallacy put out there by various "sources" that shall remain nameless so we don't politicize this.   A currency is nothing more than a medium of exchange that allows households to conduct transactions.  It is not a vehicle by which those households store wealth for long periods of time.
 If everyone used currency as a store of wealth,  we wouldn't invest in the real drivers of wealth,  namely productive corporations who drive innovation - the google's / mircosoft's / facebook's of the world.   Why the hell would I want to invest in any of those if I think some magical bean,  tulip,  bitcoin etc is going to go up to infinity?   The answer is I wouldn't  and that's why  a small predictable amount of **inflation** is actually good for an economy,  since it encourages investment into the rest of the economy,  and not hoarding. 
 The US government and arguably the Fed aren't shining examples of a well regulated,  well governed system,  replete with nepotism and corruption.  That doesn't mean there aren't well regulated, well governed systems out there - see my home country of Canada.   Again,  I've had this discussion a million times here,  and it's very tiresome,  some how BC will re-invent the laws of economics.  yawn..
@_date: 2012-12-06 18:56:10
I know that in Canada,  the government (CRA) doesn't care where you make a profit,  it's taxable regardless of location.  So in our case at least,  there's no such thing as a tax haven / off shore account... Theoretically at least.  And not to say that it doesn't happen.

Bitcoin by definition was designed to be a currency.   It has no other  no other intrinsic value.    It's a bunch of numbers in a box, given arbitrary value, just like every other currency.

There are technological differences.  Fundamentally, the laws of economics are no different to BC or any other currency. 


There are plenty of positive reasons for BC,  but not for the reasons I've outlined.  What is scary is the community's hardcore fanboyism attitude towards it,  and it's inability to take any criticism whatsoever.  I've laid out these same comments in and been upvoted to high heaven.  But somehow knows better. 


It is NOT debated.  Not one iota!  The so called Austrian School has about zero credibility in any serious school of economics (it is of course the Bible on Reddit) .  Without a modest amount of inflation you again,  face the problems I've described.  You need to push people out of physical currency and into investment, or else you get the deflationary spiral. Physical currency is a medium of exchange and doesn't actually produce goods and services in of its self. 


Economists didn't create the financial crisis. Nor is their job to tell you that you're stupid.  That's just a caricature of the elitist academic and why academia isn't trust worthy. 


Again stop putting words in my mouth.  I never said I "know".   I'm arguing from a historical standpoint from what has occurred  with other currencies (and BC is no different,  I don't care what anyone says).  Besides, the concern with deflation isn't so much about the literal value,  so much as it is the goods and services being devalued (relative to the currency) since there's less people spending the currency,  which forces merchants to discount,  spend less and the cycle repeats.   You probably wont see these effects right this instant,  because most merchants aren't dependant on BTC whatsoever.   Maybe the odd drug dealer.  But if BTC were to become a more forceful currency,  then these effects that I've described would absolutely become an issue.  I don't need to defend it.  It's all over wikipedia. See the great depression.

I'm sorry but I don't have time to explain a rudimentary concept like deflation to every person in here's a summary:
"In monetarist theory, deflation must be associated with either a reduction in the money supply, a reduction in the velocity of money or an increase in the number of transactions. But any of these may occur separately without deflation. It may be attributed to a dramatic contraction of the money supply, or to adherence to a gold standard or other external monetary base requirement.
However, deflation is the natural condition of hard currency economies when the supply of money is not increased as much as positive population growth and economic growth. When this happens, the available amount of hard currency per person falls, in effect making money more scarce; and consequently, the purchasing power of each unit of currency increases. Deflation occurs when improvements in production efficiency lower the overall price of goods. Competition in the marketplace often prompts those producers to apply at least some portion of these cost savings into reducing the asking price for their goods. When this happens, consumers pay less for those goods; and consequently deflation has occurred, since purchasing power has increased."
By it's very nature, BC will do this.  Specifically "supply of money is not increased as much as positive population growth and economic growth."  
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:07:48
Yeah I'm not sure how a P/E relates to bc either. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:42:44
Probably because the BC economy is so small,  so illiquid,  and so new,  there are very few merchants who can reliably see trends like that with any certainty.   With the USD,  you can see deflationary / inflationary trends with more certainty.  That being said,  the formula for BTC is written on the wall and is just a function of time.
Hoarding isn't an argument,  it's a fact.  It happens in large economies when deflation occurs -  source: 
"In more recent economic thinking, deflation is related to risk: where the risk-adjusted return on assets drops to negative, investors and buyers will hoard currency rather than invest it, even in the most solid of securities.[8] This can produce a liquidity trap"
@_date: 2013-04-29 06:35:30
I will say that one of the brilliant things that BTC will be known
for is how it was bootstrapped (ie. mining).  Using a computers 
processing power to convert electricity into BTC effectively bypassed
the financial systems up until now.  You didn't need to convert
currency whatsoever for quite some time.   That being said though,
that bootstrapping process only works for so long,  and for a select few.
The banks are a must now,  if widespread adoption is possible. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:37:27
what if there was an accepted tolerance or degree of loss
in the system?  Perhaps if this known % was low enough,
the network would be trusted enough for widespread use?
What if the network gave each user an incentive to complete
each transaction?

Evidence?  All I see is some rambling incoherent
nonsense about how your fantasy bank in Panama
would pick up the slack if banks started to turn against
BTC.   What the fuck kind of evidence is that?
Your youtube economics lessons aren't doing so well.
If BTC is relegated to one bank in fucking Panama,
BTC becomes a niche market.  One shitty bank 
in Panama means that it becomes increasingly difficult
for customers to do business in BTC, since there's
only one place to actually access funds in BTC. 
How hard is that to comprehend.   There's a reason
the world has multiple banks.  Thousands of banks 
actually!  Different banks, service different customers.
If BTC is isolated to one bank, in one country,  it will
only ever see a tiny market,  and liquidity will be 
fucking dog shit.   (Source: I have a B.Comm and I'm
working on a CFA).  So go back to your youtube videos.

lol what?  I'm implicitly trusting the laws of supply and demand.  
Banks dominate the global financial system.  Without them do you
think that there might be a **little bit of a problem** on both the supply and the demand side - since a) you can't convert your BTC out to USD easily (glut of BTC supply side),  and b) you can't move your USD into BTC (low liquidity (demand).
So there's your supply and demand break down.  Without the banks your up fuck creak - bitcoin will be relegated to a fringe movement and will never gain mainstream adoption,  regardless of how emotional you or anyone else gets about it.  Banks are the game,  and if they don't let you play,  the game is over.   period.
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:32:07
Bitcoin will die an instant death if the banks turn against it.  Liquidity will totally and utterly dry up,  and the price will implode.  
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:26:28
Yes but like I said, there are payment processors like PP et. al,
but none of them have to absorb the potential losses that BTC might
incur.   Native internet currencies or not (it makes no difference)
a Bitcoin processor is going to have to absorb a shit ton of risk
with the wild swings in price.  That risk is going to have to be passed
onto the consumer in some form,  somehow.  Just because BTC is
an internet currency doesn't absolve it of the fundamentals of economics.
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:32:24
You're putting words into my mouth.  I didn't say there would be no demand.  My point is that by their very nature BC's are injected at a slower rate over time.  As such, there is an incentive to **not** use the coins in your pocket,  since there's going to be fewer produced.  It's the exact,  same argument that people make against the USD.  The Fed prints more money and devalues the USD,  thus it's worth less.  In this case it's the reverse.  Why is this so controversial in this reddit? 
A reasonable amount of *inflation* is a good thing,  and every single credible economist on the face of the planet will tell you so.  BitCoins will not provide this.  Any sort of dancing around this fact is simple circlejerking and why most Bitcoin'ers get laughed at when they try and do the same dance in @_date: 2013-05-03 01:41:08

I'm sure Bill the marketing / accounting / mba / whatever guy at Walmart / Target / etc,  would love to be responsible for spearheading the bitcoin project.  When Walmart starts accepting Bitcoins on their 2 percent margin goods and BTC goes from 250 bucks to 50 (again), Bill will no doubt have a job the next morning.   I'm sure he'll have a great story for his CV come Monday morning.  
Meanwhile,    1 dollar US is worth roughly 1 dollar US tomorrow.  Why would any *big* merchant take a risk like that,  they aren't in the business of gambling on commodities. 
It's good for the Silk road because no one will touch that for obvious reasons. Usenet the same thing.   Reddit and OKcupid do it because it's trendy.  There hasn't been major adoption whatsoever.

You're like so many in this subreddit.  You get mad and emotional
when you're faced with facts.  You guys spew out insults when you
can't find a good enough retort.  It's like a fucking cult here.


Guess what,  if there's only one bank that will change BTC - USD - BTC
you're still fucked.  By definition that means that the market has shrunk
by an enormous amount.  If you're relying on some shit hole bank
in Panama to bring forth your BTC revolution you're in deep shit
since instead of 1000 banks world wide,  you're forcing people to move
funds to some backwards ass country with weak regulations. 
 I'm sure that will go over well with people wanting to move 100's of thousands or millions.   Having only one bank,  is just like having one
major exchange (Mt.Gox),  the entire currency would be even more
volatile since any issue,  any problem with that bank would send the
price of BTC into a tailspin, just like we've seen with Mt.Gox.  Having
problems with both the banks and the exchanges would fuck bitcoin
so go back to your libertarian friends and circlejerk yourselves to sleep and a take a few economics classes while you're at it. You're the shits at it. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 01:03:19
If BTC is continually deflationary, it's usefulness as a currency is limited for the very reason you pointed out.  People will hoard it so they can become internet rich. **What's one good reason for me to spend my 1 BTC if I know it's going to be worth 2 BTC tomorrow?**  That's a shitty currency if it encourages no one to spend it on goods and services.
