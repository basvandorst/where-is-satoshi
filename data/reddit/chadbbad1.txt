How did you discover it? Did you get a email, or were unable to log into your account?  I use 2fa, and make sure you do it for all transactions there is an option to do it for transactions over a certain amount.

I guess you would have to be doing it with $5-10,000 to negate the transaction fees

Because they are attached right? It's all xrp/btc 
Or neo/eth if the Second half of the ratio goes down then so does the first half. Look at graphs in USD, omg/usd

Some of the reports I'm hearing is that it takes hours sometimes days. Should be here by next Christmas though.

All I hear is how China is enabling North Korea, that if they would put small sanctions on them it would show them they don't support their actions and it would tone them down.  
Every year the United States and South Korea join forces in the largest wargames ever conducted. They pretend to attack North Korea every year. And there's no wonder their dictator is paranoid.

My debit card was instant, my bank is 7-10 days

What will that mean for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:04:15
Why not put it in a an unexpected place, like taped to the top of the refrigerator. What are the chances that someone did steal your safe and will even know what the hell it is, and if they did,  would they know how to use it?

24hrs coinbase to binance for me

Aren't a lot of The coins infinite? I know Ethereum is for right now, but similarly will take longer and longer to create. It also appears the threat of quantum computers are not legitimate, and the technology in secure public key crypto  will increase as well.

My credit union said the same thing, U.K. I told him it's all good I want to go through, and still can't use it. Using big banks for now.

TIL There is a finite number

How can crypto be legit with this happening. If you cant sell within an hour, should be minutes max.

I would say there are about 60 million Americans who have never made an electronic payment, never paid online, and may not even have a checking account, that’s 20%. It will be a hard job for them to switch, and that population over 40 won’t even try. Will they be able to use electronic payments, with no access to electronics?
