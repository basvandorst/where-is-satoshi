Did you just say logic and reasoning are not being assessed with our standing that bitcoins troublesome issues and community logic are favored over ethereums? Please find common ground in leading BTC.. something Bitcoin can learn from if it had some logic going forward.. we aren't in faith over logic... Eth has functioned in the highest regard of logic .. it's effecting absolutely every human interactional detail and being accepted in so many lights.. avenues of success are not just monetary gain.. but usage.. application.. community.. acceptance.. smart interaction will show it's value just like the smart phone opened us up to the world.. smart phones connected us.. smart contracts will improve us..

I've stated what's been happening and there is proof of this.. if Bitcoin community enjoys turning blind eyes to issues for many years of retarded issues that could be resolved with community coherence but is not.. what I'm saying is Bitcoin is definitely losing traction in a lot of aspects and I went into more detail why.. Ethereum is really incredible in the sense they solve implement and handle with a more forward approach as a community and as usage from commercial and user centric handles that eth has built on.. eth will hold digitized versions of most major currencies soon.. if that's not enough to move Bitcoin market share to eth I think pulling out sooner then later is of most importance to Bitcoin holders..

Nature really did collide with you... I'm not bashing Bitcoin I think it will live but it will suffer.. also you really shouldn't call eth a shit coin.. I think I described that blind eye mentality​ extremely well..

Wait for the flippening to commence.. Ethereum will take most of your market share..
