This here is the real value in bitcoin. The real reason its revolutionary. You can send money to anyone in the world instantly with no middleman and almost no fees. Yeah yeah yeah there are issues right now. There werent always issues and there are fixes being worked on. 
Imagine for instance you have family traveling abroad. Something tragic happens and they need you to wire them money. How long and how expensive to do it through a bank? With bitcoin it has the possibility to be instant and nearly free. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:19:45
Even if you spend bitcoin on a good or service it still counts as a gain and you still have to pay taxes on it.

What if you mine alt coins and exchange for bitcoin. Is it only one taxable event when I exchange the alt coin for bitcoin, or do I have two? One from receiving the alt coin when I find a block and one from trading it for BTC?

ITs more than a currency. It is a payment system that is a million times more secure than credit cards, faster and cheaper than bank transfers and its impossible to falsify transactions. The implications behind the technology are huge beyond investing and being a currency.

Heres one example. An immigrant is here in the united states working and sending money back home to his family. Cash takes a while and is risky. Wire transfers cost money and also take awhile. With bitcoin your family could ask for grocery money from halfway across the world and that immigrant worker could send it in seconds for almost no cost.

It doesnt suck. I mined a fair amount of bitcoin back in the day. I spent the bitcoin at places that accepted bitcoin. The way I look at it is that people like you and me kept the ecosystem alive to get to where it is now. If I would have have just held all of my coins what good does that do growing the bitcoin economy? I mean, currency needs to be circulated to work as a currency right?

Yeah. Same.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:04:07
No hardware requirement per say but in a pool you are paid based on proofs of work submitted and accepted by the pool. Hypothetically speaking, someone with a graphics card might submit 1 proof of work in an hour and someone with an asic chip submits 500. When the block is complete the whole pool gets paid according to how much they contributed. 
So while you can technically do it on a graphics card, you will burn out the card before you earn anything.

honey pot sales dont really do anything to stop the distribution. Sure it goes after people using the drugs. One might argue that is part of the reason for the complete failure of the war on drugs. Watching the blockchain might help you see what addresses are sending and receiving the bitcoins. Even if you track the bitcoin address to an ip address, that only might give leo a location to go.

It's variable. Nobody's mining Bitcoin with these. They mine altcoins and trade or hold or use. There are alot of altcoins. All with different values. All with different returns 
Folks mine with a number of strategies. Some use software that mines the most profitable coin at any given time. Some sell their hashing power to places like nicehash who then rent it out. Some folks just read the market hemselves.
It's complicated. I'd recommend reading up on hashing algorithms. Whattomine.com has a profitably calculator. Otherwise the best way to learn is to try, fail and keep trying until you get it right.

Have you worked with the homeless or any charities at all in your life? A lot of cities, mine included have pretty good networks for people who are homeless. You forget that mainstream americal upgrades their cellphones and computer on an average of once per year. The number of electronic devices that end up in landfills overseas is absolutely absurd. 
The lifespan of a laptop is easily 5 years if its even moderately taken care of. Same with a smartphone. There are organizations out there, like freegeek, that take in donations of equipment. People literally hand them perfectly good equipment that is 3 or 4 years old with the explanation that it is outdated.
Whats wrong with fixing that equipment up and giving it back out to homeless people? America and land of opportunity and all. People like you talk about homelessness being a problem but then when they go and try to do somethign about it, you bitch and moan because suddenly they are not fitting your stereotype of what a homeless person should be. 
Enough electronics are trashed in this country to give everybody a decent mobile device.

No. Absolutely not. You need high end gpus to mine. Even then, gpus are being replaced by highly specialized chips called fpgas and asic. These chips are made specifically for calculating hash values.

Hackers are responsible for the majority of the technology that you work with on a daily basis. Your phone, whether it is Android or an Iphone has the fingerprints of hackers all over it. 
The New York Stock Exchange uses Red Hat Linux which in turn uses the Linux Kernel which was written by a hacker named Linus Torvalds. A person who still works on the kernel to this day and attends various "Hacking" conferences. The annual Kernel Hackers Summit for example. 
 Android also utilizes the Linux Kernel btw. 
Linux is probably the best example I can think of right now. It is continually maintained by people that openly refer to themselves as hackers. And linux is in everything. And I mean everything. Networking gear, cell phones, servers, supercomputers, embedded computers, desktops etc. 
Google Arduino and Raspberry Pi to get an idea of how the hacker community is influencing the future of technology.

Yes. Litecoin are another peer to peer currency. There are probably a dozen in existence right now. There is no official exchange. There are probably a couple of hundred. The exchange that I work with the most for litecoin is  They facilitate buys and sells of a couple of different  crypto currencies. If you wanted to exchange with someone personally without going through an exchange, you certainly could. With an exchange though you transfer funds into it, complete your orders, and transfer funds back out into either your bank or your wallet. Make sense? 
  This is a pretty comprehensive link of bitcoin businesses. The exchanges are at the top. This list is outdated though. CampBx isn't on there I don't think. I know namecheap accepts bitcoin because I just reregistered all my domains with bitcoin. Click around and check it out. Cryptocurrencies are pretty fascinating.

Gpus are meant to do a number of linear calculations that are very similar. Example, rendering pixels on a screen. Mining bitcoins follows a similar pattern.

And once you pay 500 dollars for a pair of oakley sunglasses on a street corner in new york only to find out later that they are knock offs, you will remember that as well. 
My point is, as a consumer you have a partial responsibility to ensure you are purchasing from somewhere reputable. The beauty of the internet is that information is readily available. Non reputable bitcoin services, while they do exist, are usually outed pretty quickly.
The 4 or 5 online bitcoin stores I have worked with so far have all been great. In fact, I had your scenario happen to me almost exactly. I ordered a raspberry pi from bitcoinin and it showed up completely dead. Their customer service was fantastic and they had me swapped for a working unit in a matter of days. My experience has been that reputable retailers really do stand out among the non reputable ones. If a consumer takes a little effort to research a store before they purchase, the chances of them recieving an empty computer box is slim.

Mining will always be profitable on some level for the right people. Even after all the bitcoins have been mined, which will take another 130 years or so, miners will still earn bitcoins in transaction fees. If bitcoin is still around in 130 years, they could be at hundreds of thousands per bitcoin. People would be doing transactions in point 0000000000 of a bitcoin or more. 
The miners are needed to run the network. Without the miners to verify every transaction on the block chain, bitcoin wouldn't exist.

@_date: 2013-04-03 23:12:51
Yes. You can. I would get familiar with the software though

There are tons of other crypto currencies to mine. Almost all of which can be exchanged for bitcoin. I switched all my cards over to litecoin a couple months ago. Have made quite a bit already. 
@_date: 2013-02-04 06:27:48
It will take another 130 years to mine all of the bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:56:58
If the miners stopped then transactions would stop.

True dat. I'm used to getting my coins from mining.

Point number 5 which should really be point number 1. You shoudl buy a Jalapeno to support the network. The miners not only mine coins by hashing the algorithm; they verify the transactions by doing so as well. Without the miners the network simply wouldn't exist..
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:37:51
Or you could simply point out all the other technology that was put together by "Hackers." Companies like Apple that were put together by people that proudly refer to themselves as hackers. Or a 20 year old Finnish hacker named Linus Torvalds who wrote an operating system kernel that is running in the majority of computing devices. Including their android smartphone. 
It doesn't take much more than a sentance to reallign their association with the meaning. If they say, "Well I don't want to be associated with a bunch of "Hackers." Just point out that most of the world we live in was put together by hackers. You have plenty of prominent people to choose from who refer to themselves as hackers.

Bitcoin don't come from a company per say. Bitcoin is in its simplest definition, a peer to peer protocol. Very similar to bittorrent. Litecoin is just another cryptocurrency using the same protocol that bitcoin uses with an altered algorithm. You mine them completelly seperate from bitcoin. They are their own project with its own blockchain. You can trade them on certain exchanges for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:22:46
I would love to do some testing for this project. I'm not much of a programmer. Mostly do scripting in bash and python. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 12:02:27
Miners dont create coins. You dont have any understanding of how it works. The miners are not there to mine bitcoins. That is not their function. Miners verify transactions. Completing the process yields a reward. Even after every new bitcoin is creatwd the miners will still be verifying and getting paid in btc for the work.
@_date: 2013-01-30 12:57:20
Cool. Thanks 
@_date: 2013-02-25 20:48:40
Profit miners measure in terahashes. Mh will get you no return. You would just be supporting the network 
@_date: 2013-02-04 03:47:37
Please don't use the faucets like a bitcoin mine. The bitcoins that are there are donated and are for the purpose of generating interest. If you want coins mine them, sell goods or services, or buy them on an exchange. 
@_date: 2013-02-02 15:12:41
Buying bitcoin should not be a weeks long process. With bit instant you can have coins in a matter of hours

I dont understand what this has to do with my comment. After he served his jail sentence, and went off probation, he started a security company. He does pen testing. He still utilized his hacking skills. He still hacks. That was my point.

I think the future is cruptocurrencies in general. I'm fully planning on mining whatever is profitable and exchanging for whatever happens to be popular. Make no mistake about it, the block chain technology behind btc, Ltc, etc is the future. I have no idea what I'll be mining in 3 years but it's kind of cool that my earnings in btc are allowing me to put together the hardware to take advantage of this cryptocurrency revolution. 
@_date: 2013-02-06 13:28:22
No clue. If you aren't making any interest then I don't see why they would. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:30:02
Seconded on the raspberry pi. I would buy one from bitcoinstore. I've only seen them on one other site for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 12:21:37
Sure they would. I have thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin. All mined. I never convert any of it into fiat. I buy shit with it. Shit like, a new television, an ipad, a new computer, coffee, etc.

Although it wasnt invented by Al Gore, he has a very large hand in making it happen. To say he helped invent the internet isn't that far off.

Currently yes. Once they ship though, these little guys could become the backbone of the network

Mining is becoming increasingly specialized and it is extremely competative. I would really research it before doing it. You likely will not get much doing just a little mining. If you want to experiment with mining, I highly suggest checking out some of the other cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:22:12
I mine all my bitcoins. I never sell during crashes.

This has nothing to do with bitcoin. Gambling has been eating up the savings of men men for millenia. Part of why I don't gamble... With anything

The brick and morter stuff still has a ways to go. Purchasing online however is clearly superior to bitcoin. Here is why. Purchasing online with bitcoin helps protect you from identity theft. If you are like me, and are starting to do more and more purchasing online, anywhere you enter your credit card info and other personal info, you expose yourself to risk. With bitcoin you are required to turn over zero sensitive financial information such as a credit card number. 
I have found lately that it is better to think of bitcoin as a money transfering protocol rather than a straight up currency. Yeah, it has some propterties as a currency. I think the real value though is that I can make purchases without giving out my cc info, and I can transfer value to anyone at any time anywhere in the world for little cost. 
Another area where bitcoin is superior to anything we have now is micropayments. Think about it. You can literally send the value of a dollar to somebody halfway across the world. You can donate 50 cents to a charity you stumble upon simply by sending to their bitcoin address. No signing forms and paying with your credit card.

@_date: 2013-03-30 13:52:59
Let's be honest here. You didn't really seem that open to participating in the first place. I understand your skepticism but sometimes to take the plunge you need to set your skepticism aside. 
I was simply pointing out that with a half hour of research into any of the given exchanges would have answered your questions about it being a scam. 
Even your unanswered questions Could have been put here better. You never asked about any specific exchanges. You just started off with 'why should I hand my info over to a bunch of shady exchanges.' 
I really could care less if you get into bitcoin or join the community. The train will move forward without you and anyone else who feels too skeptical to participate in bitcoin. In the end it's all about your comfort level.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:51:52
Go fuck yourselves Mt gox. This shit happens far too often. Your exchange and it's fucking shitty engineering are the reason we have such massive price fluctuations like we saw yesterday. 
I will never use your service. I will tell everyone I know how much you guys suck. You deserve to go out of business. 
@_date: 2013-02-06 12:52:13

I havent used it to pay someone in person yet. I did however transfer to bitcoin to my android wallet just to see what it was like. I made a purchase on bitcoinstore and used the qr code function. THAT was pretty fucking cool. Here, let me just hold my phone up to my computer screen and BOOM! purchase completed. The only information I had to put in was where I wanted the item shipped. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:03:37
The guy is so well spoken. Really glad he's a spokesperson
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:26:11
The thing is, all those bitcoin billionaires are going to need to put their coins back into circulation. If they really never want to work again they will have to at least buy food lol. Either they sell some bitcoin for cash or they exchange some for commodities. 
Besides, not all early adopters are holding. Some of us are spending some of our coins.

Mt gox,  coin base etc are not unknown entities. Look back over the last 10 years at all the companies you give information to.  All places that handle money for you require identification. Mutual funds, banks, money exchanges etc. If you want bitcoin anonymously you need to mine or go to local bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 11:57:42
there is nothing tangible behind the dollar either.

You have no clue what you are talking about. The limit of the number of btc in creation is finite. Its built into the system. A group cant just decide to raise the limit. Please go do some research before you speak like an expert.

I cant buy a car but ive mined enough to buy a nice home theater setup or a new kitchen or something like that. I think Im still just going to aquire them. I have kind of a set number I want to aquire before I start to spend them... I dunno. 
@_date: 2013-02-06 13:21:15
Then no. The irs doesn't have the resources to proactively check everyone's accounts. The do however audit people at random. If you get audited then they start looking to see if you have any other accounts.

Not sure. I'm mining litecoins until my asic shows up.

In the case of what you are talking about, anything short of food, medicine or ammunition is going to be worthless. Paper dollars, gold, bitcoin. If all electricity shuts off everywhere you have bigger things to worry about than your finances.

You keep saying some anonymous websites. Exchanges like Mt gox are not anonymous websites. You've only been on board with this two days. Do your research instead of just shrugging off every website you have never heard of.

Around 800 mhs I think.  I never got one. Too pricey. They handled shipping however as another poster pointed out, they were just reselling already built fpgas.

Won't work. Too many people outside the United States use bitcoin. Probably half the hashing power from the network comes from overseas.

Um No. The words mean exactly what they did 30 years ago. Sure the media has bastardized the term but the true definition of the word hacker still remains and it is used in its proper sense a lot more than you probably think. Have you ever been to a HOPE conference or a CCC camp or Defcon? Some of the computer industries most influential people come to these conferences and they all refer to themselves as hackers. 
We are talking folks like Steve Wozniak and Richard Stallman. Linus Torvalds refers to himself and his colleagues as hackers. 
It sucks that the media bastardized the term but why should we stop using it? Why should we let it remain bastardized? I think we use the correct terminology and correct those who are wrong. And if it is the 90 percent computer illiterate? Who really cares. Every single one of them relies on technology that was put together by "hackers" They should realize and respect that.

Go online to a store that deals in bitcoins. Anything under 100 dollars is listed in hundredths of a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 12:06:24
No they dont. Miners verify the blockchain. The transactions are what make up the block. the miners are simply verifying it and nothing more.
@_date: 2013-05-23 04:30:43
Oh Fuck.... I had this exact same thought. I was looking around at the amount of equipment I have started amassing wondering if I could rent out computing power to anyone. I'm pretty far from being able to open my own company based around it but fuck I would love to contribute to something like this.
