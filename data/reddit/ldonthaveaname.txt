A lot of people sold and started seriously investing in alt coins when they realized how heavily pumped btc is. I'm in at 15k just holding, but I'm cutting loss at 6k.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:17
I don't understand the practical value of btc and I keep asking hoping to be reassured, but no one is telling me. I showed up bitching about high fees got called a troll like how is it trolling to post a screen shot of a 18 dollar fee just to send myself 50 dollars from coinbase. I get conceptually I can lower the fee down to like 8 dollars manually or whatever, but I'd have to move them first. So basically I'm screwed. How am I going to use this as a currency if it doesn't actually work? Is there a fix coming? Because if not, I can't hold anymore. It isn't doing its job, it's just going up in price and tbh I don't care -  I need it for transactions and payments and receiving so I can get off PayPal etc. But it's not working... Soooooo

The philosophy here seems strange to me and strange that a lot are agreeing and sharing similar. 
It's a smart investment to put money in something you beleive in and really think is a good idea or at least has a chance to be the great ponzischeme of all time. Either way, it isn't gambling it's like a calculated risk that in some ways becomes a sure thing once you see huge chess pieces moving. You know those factions will invest so much real world capital and resources that the cost of this dumb Internet meme or greatest social overhaul of money since the fall of Rome will continue to rise to a certain amount. 
I can understand being frustrated with selling too soon and losing your to - point gross gains, and having to take a momentary financial loss go reinvest, but being smart enough to buy into the future is not the same as memeing away 15k on the far far chance of winning the lottery. 
This ain't a get rich quick scheme. These days it might be, but it wasn't back then and to me never felt that way. 
Maybe I'm the lucky gambler. Maybe I should have put in more.

I wanted to send $50 to my friend and it cost $17 from coinbase. This is fact not fiction and I have no agenda, I'm just butthurt as fuck that bitcoin has no functional value to me whatsoever. I've had this account for like 5 years I think, I wanted to post publicly on this so I don't get accused of shilling. It's bullshit. What is the point of holding anymore? If 100% buisnesses in America started using BTC and even smart phones started mining, would this help? Because I don't have any cofidence that's ever going to happen when you tell a person that your 50$ purchase is lowkey gonna cost 67$. I'm not paying for 2 beers every time I want to make small purchases dude. I'm selling everything the moment coinbase stops locking me out (that's why I showed up here today, wondering why the fuck my sales is "disabled").
Edit: read in another comment the "solution" is to "send to another wallet that I can control the fee with". Uh...that would still cost me the same $17 to move it in the first place. So....
e2; idc if btc moons to 30k im out at 19k. it serves me no use ordering legal med supplies if my shipping cost is less than my btc fee
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:33:52
I don't know but I speculate you're attached to the wrong comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:08:25
It's fun to watch people who have nothing to lose say it's easy. When you've already made close to 1000% or some insane gains, it's easy to not care. The decision is real for people who invested towards the top. Only two questions:
Will it go above my original bid? 
Can I wait that long, or am I desperate to stop losses now (bad choice - don't over invest). 
So holding is easy AF for early adopters. Of course it is. Only greed is against them, they aren't losing anything but potential profit which is not the same as loss (unless you're a huge corporation cheating the tax man). 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:45:59
What point do we stop holding? Seriously, it'll never be a global currency, because fees are insane... 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:52:00
Woah! Seriously? I'm going to do this and start day trading on margins on a 15k bank loan :o

Is this sarcasm? I really have no idea. I mean I get the joke, but I can't tell if its just being cute, or if I shouldn't buy from coinbase (if not where from do you think)?
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:18:37
Why did it drop so much? I literally came here specifically (to this sub) to find out o_O
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:21:29
Is that how you would advise a newbie? I mean, I know the basics, I just finally have the funds to invest about $100. Worst case scenario I just resell them or lose $100 whatever. So you think coinbase or whatever?
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:40:59
Idk what that means 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:41:02
Why are so many people saying so many different things on If there are enough people to make  a fork, is the speculation on price really fraudulent?
Seems like  even if the consensus is amongst those investors only it's still more or less free money for us peasants? What am I missing. Is Bcc not going to take over? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:47:45
I'm holding both. Worst case scenario, I lose literally nothing. How can this plan fail? Unless both coin and alt coin crash beneath where I bought in which is very possible, but seems very unlikely....

They've not been wrong about bitcoin so far but they still random alts so if you ignore that and stick with the good discussion threads it's really pretty based. They predicted the split and the inflation. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:53:10
Other subs and 4chan don't seem so sure... 
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:02:35
So would the profit of a split actually ever somehow outweigh the mining costs and losses? People look at these huge numbers like millions in losses but that might mean exactly nothing to those actually controlling the markets and the structure of the network. Am I way off?

For reference I study propaganda and psychology. I knew it was a sure bet to invest.  I'm also a fiction author by trade and study, so I've been writing a ton of high stakes crypto scenes - like the cyberpunk bar with virtual reality pods they use to cause a market disruption by using the pods as miners and the subsequent Yakuza shoot out and gang war it causes. To me, a few hundred in my own personal fiat meme currency in emotional stakes made it way more fun to write and way more realistic and dynamic. Thing is, I am bad at math, worse at economics - minus the theory, especially when it involves humans and their hilarious human memes. Emotional risk, fear of loss, identity, ego. All these half baked intellectual ideas I can't really fire through my circuits without them melting. 
All that said, I got in and had a lot fun watching the great btc meme wars, and I'm just hoping six years from now we get a sequel and I'll be able to play as a low key vetran. I started studying this stuff in 2012, but got knowingly FOMO because I wanted to play before the stakes went down. I got wrecked n_n
Call it a doctor's thesis. It isn't, but call it that so I feel validated online. Also I wrote the story about "get tickets for the moon bus" where in chapter 2 this one schiziod character is nagging everyone at the cyberpunk hologram show bar / gamer hang out arcade basement / virtual reality pods / mining crypto place to "buy moon bus tickets". Only two others, literally the dumbest other characters that barely can use English and rant about the illuminati buy the tickets. Eventually, the crypto price towards the end of the story after a hurricane (climate change sucks) slams neotokyo and causes market disruptions and their coin goes up, which in turn causes the moon bus to get funded. It ends up being an advanced like Lockheed project that flies into orbit and hovers for 70 mins then goes back down. The flight home is 16 hours, but you actually pass the globe over twice. So anyone who got a moon bus ticket got to go to space for a half a wasted chapter. The moon bus is later shot down when a war starts. 
People who care too much reality(TM) amuse me. 
I just buy bitcoin because I'm batshit crazy. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:28:28
Literally every single person buying bitcoin is running the exact same game as me. Literally everyone who says "hold until rich" is doing the same. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:32:37
I bought 600 dollars worth at 16k. But like 800 before that? Idk I don't keep a good tally, cuz idc about money I'm what too psychotic. I think if I cash all my btc now I would break exactly even. Idk. I'd rather tell the story in 20 years that I went bankrupt like a childish fool buying in on a ponzi scheme than tell the story of "I didn't go broke but I didn't gain anything". And also I figure if it does go up then whatever. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:41:00
It's finished. People know not to buy in because unlike with smaller numbers like 1k or 200, 20k isn't and wasn't fuck around money. People bought in, got rich, scammed kids like me out of about 1k and they're not gonna pump it again. Shit is going to 2k and will stay there just from desperate bag holders wondering what happened. It's never going above 5k again. 
Honestly, I think even if "big money" tried to get a bubble that big people are going to weary. It has been proven 
A)  the network cannot support in a "crisis" or "under attack" 
And that means it has zero chance of ever "replacing currency" because it shows its worthless. 
B) big money scams - including coin base. 
How many times did they throughout the months hold the line by literally shutting down their exchange to prevent a sell off? At least 3 or 4. They literally scammed people. People are not stupid. They only let the anvil drop after they hoisted it way up to make billions 
C)  we see the so called "smart big money" is weary. They didn't actually buy in, most of the hype was generated by tether printing and fake Chinese exchanges 
D)  a new currency that this sub is at war with called bitcoin cash is basically equally as effective and equally as arbitrary. The only difference is user base as so far as I can tell both "coins" suck compared to others
E)  the markets of alt coins are dead and aren't going to come back up. Those markets alone boosted btc way WAY higher than it should have ever been valued at. 
So overall, bitcoin is still a nerdy side project for crypto nerds and has been proved to be corrupted, scamming, unstable, and fake news 
I am still hoping I'm wrong, otherwise my investments are losing me money if I sell. Tbh I think anyone who bought in over about 4k are already bag holders. And it was never worth 4k. It's worth maybe 40 a coin and I think bag holders will keep it around 4k just holding. Forever.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:54:29
It would be a good story.  It would invovle an Akria style bike race through highway city traffic - to get home fast enough to decrypt the server, to quick dump all the coins, before they can't be sold. It's a surprise attack, someone unloaded nearly 7% of all the holdings on the entire chain, and so you get the call from frantic dudes at your hide out and they're bugging out screaming that the stock is crashing. 
You're like "yo I'm at the mall watching the synthetic life turtle, we'll be there in 25 minutes" and they'll scream "the mall!? That's 45 minutes away!" , and you'll rev the engine and pull down sunglasses and say "nah son." and you'll rev it again and hit the kick stand, "we bike time" 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:31:20
It's not a small amount for me. That was basically the security deposit of my last rent. I am flat broke, but I'm also not starving to death and I have zero debt and no kids or expensive bills other than rent and food. So it's nice to still have at least 1k floating in bitcoin, which was at some point way up at 3k. If it drops (like my total net worth) under about 750 (my total overall investment) then I'm fucked and lose a security deposit. Whatever. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:02:42
nah it's going up and up dude. At worst that shit crashes to 1800 again the new floor will be 2500 soon AF. It's 2017 not 2013. I see the trend on coinbase back that far. It's literally up up up up up up slightly down up up up up slightly down up up up up. This time next year, I'm paying for college, a nose and tit job, and festival tickets yo we out 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:39:19
I'm assuming the recent Spike is a bubble. Hmm. Both me and my friend are going to dump out entire savings (lmfao 700 bucks) in. Hopefully if a panic goes down we'll have time to bail.

@_date: 2017-05-22 17:01:54
that's what i did with a 20 dollar investment haha! and i had another 120 in "cold storage" (read also: I'm a retard and I lost the thumb drive when I moved). Woulda been a billionheir probably! (actually just over 3k).
Do you/we really anticipate that this will continue to trend up? I mean I'm dubious but im gonna buy :P
I've set a hard cap. Don't buy above 2,500. i assume it will crash to a 2000 floor but I'm always wrong so...
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:40:00
So if I buy 100 bucks today, and tomorrow sell for 120 bucks...but i also want to stay invested...what's the point of selling if any? Should I just hold? I sold last night at 2100 lmfao and now its 2250 so im like well wait now i want to hold again? So should I just not sell in the future? i dont get this. But I made 170 pure profit so far + any purchases made with it so probably 500 total I guess idk. Is this what stock trading is? If yes I'm gonna a be a peasant for life. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:17:45

Right now I'm trying to hustle 5 bucks because the price tanked before I could purchase my fucking meds online lmfao I only have 3 bucks extra to transfer and that would cost me fucking 1.45 &gt;:{ I'm 2.94 short! UGH! lmfao and i have to wait for friday which means no meds until then. Unless my stupid new advertising hustle memes off! woo! THE RIDE!!
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:01:04
It will likely never get that big now. I'm lucky to even get a single bitcoin, I just wanna know how to stash that and treat it like gold. I was dumb and sold my 4 coins at 700. Not making that mistake again.

@_date: 2017-06-05 20:11:44
I guess I just don't see this ever going side scale like as before something like wallmart bucks or something absurd, you know? It's just not working like I can't send a 40 cent editing job for a digital graphic to someone using BTC for micro transactions. And markets include a lot of those, so I don't see this ever being more than a ponzy scheme I guess like it's going up because we believe we're sitting on  a moon bus. Or am I doubting when I should be buying still?

No, I'm the dumbest person in this thread - I don't understand what a run on the bank is and why the banks respond by closing their doors like that. Maybe you could explain? kek. As my fiction author mind invented, it's probably so that the **MILLIONS** of dollars in FIAT cash they'd have to give away within a matter of 15 minutes. But that sounds wrong because "they make money when you cash out".
Additional question to the expert: How liquid do you really think FIAT is? Moving bitcoins is a meme - the fee is paid in speculative bitstocks. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:50:16

@_date: 2017-06-10 04:46:29
Too late. Traded half my coins today. Can't lose. It is rising at a quicker percent. What's more like another 200 gain in bitcoin holding or a 50 dollar gain for ETH? If every share gains 50, that's x4 more profit in ETH than btc. It's common sense at this point. Just a 1/10th jump and the market is gonna start to tip. It won't ever favor ETH over bitcoin, unless a crash. Bit I'm better on the 50.
 1 BTC = 8.5 ETH 
Better gains. Now triple that to 3 coins. Still better gains.

People are panic (it's strategic tbh) WITHDRAWING back into the fiat banks. So Bittrex and Coinbase have both shut their doors to prevent a free-fall run on the bank. I'm moving to gemini after this and cashing out in between. Fuck coinbase.
