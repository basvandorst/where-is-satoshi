the website smells fishy ...

EDIT: can confirm that it works, at least pre-fork
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:40:40
Well Coinbase is exactly this i think ...

Just dumped via ShapeShift right now.

I wouldn't solo mine, you will very likely never find a block, and thus never get paid any bitcoin (not even one satoshi), but if you mine for a pool, you may get at least a fraction of your power costs back in bitcoin. Also personally for me it's not really fascinating looking at the miner and never getting any bitcoin, if you mine for a pool, at least you get something ...

I used bitcoinj "send" command to transfer all funds to my Electrum wallet on my PC. This was prior to the fork, so all my BCH were in Electrum when the fork happened. I could have just send the funds directly with the App but i wanted to set the tx fee manually instead of using the way to high fees the app suggested.

The question is still nit bad ...

Have you seen my other comment chain with djyp?

Transferring BTC is absolutely no problem, since BCH (= Bitcoin Cash) implements replay protection and transactions issued with any BTC software will be invalid on the BCH chain and vice versa. They did this by creating a 'new' algorithm for signatures based on parts of SegWit. BCH requires that transactions use this special new algorithm.
Basically, since you did hold your BTC in the wallet before the fork, the addresses of the wallet now hold the same amount in BCH. So the private keys for each of these addresses can now be used to send BTC and BCH away from these addresses separately.
Normally you should be able to do the following:
1. Dump the private keys from the wallet backup with wallet-tool from bitcoinj
2. Import all these private keys in Electrum
3. Send the BTC away to a fresh wallet or back to Coinbase, if you prefer
4. Import all the private keys in Electron Cash
5. Send the BCH away to wherever you like
You should make sure that you don't send all your BTC/BCH to a single address since that could be used to break bitcoins pseudonymity, because this transaction links all the input addresses together, and if one input can be linked to your identity, all the other addresses can be too. If you don't fully understand this, it's no big problem.
Electron Cash may copy all your Electrum wallets into its own data directory. I dont like this behaviour from a security standpoint, but I checked the code for Electron Cash myself and made sure that it doesnt steal my coins.
If you want I can do the job for you, but you would have to trust me for this.
If I have a little spare time, I'll write a step-by-step guide ...

What exactly did you want to do?

They require Basic verification for almost anything you could do, so you need to provide your personal information, address and phone number, but no ID verification.

Did it work or can I help you? Your last comment reads like you gave up, but maybe I'm just bad at understanding english ..

You can duplicate the backup file so if bitcoinj alters it you still have the duplicate. A backup of a backup basically :P

Used by TREZOR Shop and myself
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:20:06
Hardware Wallet (like TREZOR)
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:59:59
blockchain.info isn't controlled by you either. Invest in a hardware wallet, then you have control and get all the fork altcoins. I myself use TREZOR and i don't regret this investment. Usage of online wallets has often been a big problem when users got hacked.

But it's not a problem to run code to which BIP148 supporters contributed to?
@_date: 2017-07-09 08:12:00
not really
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:50:34
You are free to read the code before executing ... so not really arbitrary code
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:14:03
Can you actually store bitcoins on these? Like is there a QR code on the back or a NFC tag or something?
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:32:43
Thank you for the explaination. Not sure what I should think about the key being pregenerated by the maybe even unknown manufacturer ...
