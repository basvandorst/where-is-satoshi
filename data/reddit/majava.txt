Just curious what kind of economical advantage does deflationary currency offer to society? 
@_date: 2018-08-17 02:38:10
But generally you want people to consume and invest their money rather than hoard it. Economic growth and all that

And probably staying there

What I was asking was whether you seriously believe that Bitcoin will have as big of an impact on society that internet or manned flight had?
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:33:42
Yeah, good thing Bitcoin doesn't lose it's value at all.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:21:58
You honestly think your internet funbux is comparable to the invention of internet or manned flight?

Taxes gathered from citizens form the income for national budget. Government then decides how to spends this budget, ie how to use those tax dollars. Typically public services (police, public healthcare, public schools etc.), public infastructure (roads, government buildings, etc), national defence and many other things. When government decides to increase the funds for national defence, it simply allocates the budget differently. Instead of spending 1000 on healthcare, 1000 on education, 500 on defence, they spend 900 on heathcare, 900 on education, 700 on defence. 
inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. 1 dollar today buys you more than 1 dollar buys you a year from now. Thus you want to spend or invest that dollar. You can argue whether this is good or bad (most economists currently view low and steady inflation as being good for economy). But claiming that inflation is some sort of "steath tax" makes little sense.

I dont think you fully understand the concept of money, yet alone inflation.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:58:44
That makes no sense whatsoever
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:26:35
