What price does it have to reach for you to sell?
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:54:09
Do you still "know it'll bounce back up"?
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:11:42
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but maybe they just snnoy you because you're worried that they're right?
Don't really see why someone holding btc wouldn't be worried right now
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:28:59
How about now?
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:05:49
But you said before that you know it'll bounce back up. So you've changed your mind?
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:02:02
Would you still pay him if the price plummets?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:51:16
Why don't you sell?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:37:17
It's pretty funny that people who are actually smarter than others are never the ones to claim that they are smarter.

You mean "has been". Just cause it happened in the past doesn't mean it will always happen every single time...
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:26:50
I don't understand why you would ever want to do this.
What if you lose all of your money?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:00:58
That's quite stubborn of you though isn't it?
What makes you think it will go higher?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:52:09
Have you seen the price recently? Terrible time to invest
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:51:19
Buy the dips? Lol, that's just losing more money
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:08:49
Because you, the guy that posts in r/conspiracy, r/The_Donald and r/Bitcoin, are smarter than people like buffet, right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:53:25
How do you know that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:54:46
You had no idea what they were are you already want to buy some?
It's a gamble, don't put any money in that your aren't comfortable losing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:32:01
I always browse this sub out of curiosity
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:20:27
Let me repeat, you are saying that you are smarter than me, knowing literally nothing about me......
Hence, r/iamverysmart

I love how you're being upvoted, as it makes it seem like everybody thinks they are the 1%
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:13:30
Isn't this the exact point of OPs comment?  People saying "don't tell me what to do" and being overly optimistic? 
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:20:54
Yep, down, down, down.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:08:42
That's terrible advice. Only spend money that you won't mind losing all of.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:08:01
Please don't listen to this guy
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:35:49
Yes , they definitely are.
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:37:47
He did point out that all cryptocurrencies are like gambling than investing though.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:25:51
How is it a troll post?
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:34:48
Sorry to disappoint you, but no rich person is investing in Bitcoin. 
Its really just middle-class Americans that saw Bitcoin rise and thought they could make money without any knowledge.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:49:18
He never said or implied that...
