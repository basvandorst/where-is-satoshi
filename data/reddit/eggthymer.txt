This part has *never* been attributed to an official source hasn't it?
The official notice only says it can't be used, circulated "as a currency in the marketplace."
If you're so confident that the community has reached considerable consensus on China's position in Bitcoin. Let's hope the market wouldn't be too surprised if China ever does come out and ban merchants from accepting Bitcoin. There are about 20 such businesses right now, according to Coinmap.
P.S. Here in China, we know all too well that Bobby has been proved wrong quite too many times.
EDIT: Someone tells this guy merchants in China are not allowed to accept Bitcoin.

Can you recommend me some sources for financial news?
@_date: 2014-03-21 11:58:21
Is he PBOC?

Poor guy thinks "it’s possible we will see major Chinese retailers accept BTC for payments again. If so, this makes buying stuff way easier as a foreigner."
Someone needs to break the truth to him.

Analysis? Maybe. What about news?
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:34:28
So is it true that Bitcoin has no future in China as a means of payment, that no merchants and consumers and accept and pay in Bitcoin?

You fucking prophet?

Source for this? 
"This is nothing new - they banned businesses from accepting it months ago."

This is old news. Saw a tweet mid-March about that. It's set up a Hong Kong subsidiary and a new type of account it calls "International". 
EDIT: Found it:

"...from being used AS A CURRENCY." Does that equate to a ban of the use of Bitcoin for services and goods? Redditors think otherwise.

19:48 pm (15 minutes ago) From Sina News: 
Many Bitcoin exchanges have said they have not received related notice, and the trading system works as usual.
The PBOC declines to comment.

I second that a crash is ever less likely each day, and in some way the somewhat overblown December ban on financial and payment institutions' involvement in Bitcoin has prepared the market for the worst case scenario. I expect a small shock but quick recovery if my speculation turns out to be right.

I think it's "in short term impossible (近期)," rather than "near impossible (近乎)" to recognize the legitimacy of Bitcoin.
