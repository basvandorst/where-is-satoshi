By law, if you make a profit when converting it back to Dollars, your supposed to pay taxes.
Just like stocks, Futures, gambling, Gifts, inheritance, or anything that increases your wealth.

Why would they be wiped out?  If the company is generating positive revenue and has a stream of recurring income/customers........  Just like the fluctuations of a stock price doesn't "wipe out" a company that is generating positive revenues, because the stock isn't what funds the business after the initial sale.      Sure, they can offer new stock to raise funds to grow business, but usually only rapid growth companies or large mergers requires raising funds secondary issues of new stock.
ICOs should be the same.

And for a legitimate business, this won't be an issue.  Only the Penny Stocks of ICOs will be wiped. 
Especially if the ETH market drops temporarily,  it's only rh6e scammy businesses who would get wiped amd tossed.
Not a legitimate business, with major contracts &amp; projects in development with industrials, congolmerates, governments, car manufacturing, auditing, financing, and every modern industry, including improving  xrypto to be as easy as fiat.
ETH fluctuations will have little to no impact on these current, real world applications Solving real world problems.
You seem to believe all companies using Blockchain tech are all Penny stock scams, despite the major Corporations releasing near daily how they are implementing these beyond simple BTC payment systems &amp; Speculation markets...
You see zero difference between these two types of businesses?

Ive been using  Blockchain.info wallets auto fees, and all my transactions happen well under an hour.    Without the fee being insane.   Usually less than $1 US.

Why are you so concerned about what information people share?
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:29:05
8f it has real world application as a platform, it very well could be.
Speculation alone doesn't make for a long lasting investment.
The more a platform is adopted by the mainstream Consumers, the more value it has.  (Facebook vs Myspace).

Amd Google has made billions, so?
There will be new businesses using ICO that will offer credit card checkout options, land titles options, hell Qatar (i believe?) Is looking at using Blockchain to digitize passports &amp; other government functions.
Businesses will use ICOs that will handle inventory, accounting, and other ledger items built on Blockchains like ETH.
Sure, there will be shitty scammers (just like we have penny stocks and low grade tech stocks) but that doesn't mean there aren't legitimate Googles &amp; Amazons and Microsoft's on exchanges.

If you're not carrying a physical digital wallet, then there shouldn't be any Issues

Have you tried Coinbase?

What are your thoughts on etherium as an investment?
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:25:20
How long does process take online (im using a Paypal MasterCard prepaid debit)?
I heard there were lots of scams on localcoins?
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:37:06
What are smart contracts, and with etherium being expandable for other application use cases
do you think this makes etherium a good long-term investment?
Ive read about Apps like Kik developing a crypto currency (Kin) based off etherium for Consumer &amp; developer use in their app.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:47:23
Also, look up regular tech VC with a long history, and look where they are investing in the space, be it Buying Coins, or investing in ICO companies.  They won't ruin their reputation doing Pump &amp; Dump scams.

Thanks.  Will check out.   It's today buying thays getting my goat.... Argh
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:14:50
My interest is that its a platform, allowing others to build off the platform.
But Im still learning (im a total newb).   Like trying to understand smart contracts.
I know Kik is developing a Consumer marketplace in their app based off etherium, calling the currency "Kin".
Its that flexibility for other developers that peaked my interest.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:56:18
Total Newb Question.
How were you able to  accelerate another individuals transaction without access to his wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:11:41
Bitcoin is the new Gold Rush, currently.
Fiat replaced Gold.
A new or different crypto or Technology could replace BTC

When fees become a major pain point on the market, people will react as a market.
If people stop making transactions because of fees, that also lowers income.     
As long as the market is willing to pay the fees and wait times, then miners are going to do whats most Profitable.
Once that Profit stagnates or lowers, it will force miners to choose.
The market speaks.

That has nothing to do with the ICO as a system though.    Just like we had shitty internet companies in the 90's bubble, didn't mean the Amazons, Googles, and such weren't valid companies using the new system of internet.
Don't buy shitty ICOs, but that doesn't mean valid ICOs &amp; profitable companies won't exist using ICOs
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:37:23
Not when they have VC money coming in.   VCs like Andreeson are betting on legitimate companies in the space.
Just like we had shitty internet &amp; penny stocks.   Doesn't mean there weren't legitimate business startups like Google, and others who didn't have Revenues......yet didn't keep selling stock, because they were getting VC funding well before monetizing.
Again, why would a legitimate (Keyword: legitimate) business need to sell off when there will be VC funding, plus (sijce their a business) the ability to sell stock to raise funds.

Habe you looked at Mone.co?   The business idea sounds good, but the people dont.
The people behind it, many hail from the same company "ensogo" which does buy outs.     The parent company bought e-commerce/Groupon-like site named BeeCrazy in asia, and rapidly closed shop.  Leaving customers &amp; merchants losing money.
The Beecrazy founders became executives at Parent Australia company, and are now forming Mone.co.   Issuing ICO.
The Idea &amp; model sounds great, but research the top people (found on the Founders page) and thats what makes me worry.
Now, if another group did this (backed by legit VC funders like Andreeson, for example) the Idea of a Crypto Visa, allowing checkout at any store.....I would be all in, taking risk..
Since they would make revenue thru a 1% fee, rather than the large fees by CC companies &amp; banks.       That's game Changer for Consumers &amp; Store owners who pay excessive fees as well.
Built on etherium and smart contracts, it allows almost instant settlement just like a bank &amp; CC card for both parties, buying in store, online, or at atms.
This is were due diligence comes in

Use a Blockchain.info wallet.   Buy BTC on Coinbase, coinmama, etc and transfer to your Blockchain.info wallet.
Blockchain.info also has a great FAQ telling you how to recover your wallet if you lose your log in information.
Seriously, just open a Blockchain.info wallet before buying any BTC, then read &amp; learn.   Its not hard for the basics.
Also, etherium might be a good long-term investment, which Blockchain wallet also supports
