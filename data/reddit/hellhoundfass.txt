maybe BTC is like Cady Heron and Fiat is like Gretchen Wieners after she got pushed in front of that bus.

what if I told you it was designed to handle a traditional money market and these fluctuations are nothing new for economists.

its going to have to be a language change. Converting finances into decimal notation to eight decimal places will find itself a very comfortable place in the future. Most crypto is using this notation to better illustrate the coins worth as a fraction of a whole which will not go away any time soon in thus field.
Having people adapt to working in decimal notation will also have a spillover benefit where science and tech / finance intersect.

One thing I do hate about bitpay is that you have to transfer wallet funds directly from a bitpay controlled wallet. So far you can only transfer BTC so that's two transaction fees at famous BTC rates.

No he's right. There is a lot of untapped bcash but also bcash was designed to be a cheaper BTC. It's going to stabilize somewhere. It will take some time before bcash stabilizes and 300 isn't a terrible level to cash out at. There's plenty of moves in the market besides sitting on bcash. The sooner we have most of the market cash out on it, the sooner we can have it fluctuate on the market at a normal rate.

Adding Segwit is like having someone else restore the Mona Lisa by making it larger just so more people can see it from afar. It's not the same original painting. but whatevs. it's just art.

guys please don't say *triggered*.

We should defend against Segwit3X too. We NEED BTC as a valuable coin, even if tx fees are unfavorable.

Good on them. The payout probably cut into their profits.

blockchain is way harder to explain than bitcoin
