Great reminder! We should all take a moment to be as concerned about our data security as we are about daily charts.
Maybe pick just one day a week where, instead of going to the charts, do a safety audit on the quality of your offline storage.

Thank you! Some of the simple things I like are:
 - Verifying the effectiveness of your paper wallets: do some tiny transactions using the paper wallet keys - just to double check you've got the details correct
 - Only shift the full amount of your holdings to the paper wallet addresses once you're certain the details are right with a round trip transaction
 - Print them acid free paper with a decent printer! You don't want to come back and discover the ink has faded or the paper is degraded
 - Make 3 copies, place them in a plastic (waterproof) envelope.  Leave one at home, one in a safety deposit box and one with a trusted relative
 - Get 3 new USB sticks and keep a digital copy with the paper copies (for those coins that aren't compatible with a hardware wallet)
 - Research and choose a hardware wallet that suits your needs for the coins that are compatible!
 - If you have a trusted spouse/partner/sibling/friend share the locations
Hope that helps :-)

Thank you that's correct!  Was getting a little tired when I finished that post :-)

Totally agree! Don't worry about 2013 - think about the SMS you're sending in 2018! Make sure that the ones you send today will give you pride in 5 years from now.

Wouldn't that go against the whole premise of bitcoin?

Besides, it doesn't matter if there are lost coins - the market place will automatically adjust the price to reflect the value of the coins in circulation.  So the only effect of burning allegedly lost coins is to compromise the network and the holdings of people.
