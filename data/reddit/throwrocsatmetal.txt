before it becomes a payment network, it has to have a viable value to the general population further than 'it finds complex algorithms'  that somehow translates into currency.

what security? have you already forgot about this? 
or 
Mt Gox and the ruling in Japan for their victims?

all of those words are nice, but the community was still affected by the trust given to those words via Mt Gox. If that value was held in an FDIC insured bank, you would have had your money back. i hate to be simplistic, but dealing paypal goods/services as a buyer gives you full ability to reneg those charges if it doesn't actually happen as you'd purchased . Your fancy jargon is seemingly just saying the things that banks already do if you care to use their services they provide and that's why bitcoins hard to adopt by the masses.

and it doesnt give you the insurance that going through those clearing houses does. look at what happened when a bit coin nut held himself up in japan. He was passing those transactions through his own accounts. If you lose your bitcoin wallet, theres no insurance because theres nothing to back it. It's giving value to data issues and claiming those issues are worth more than gold except theres no vault kept where the issues you find are secured. They're just floating around under 'encrypted wallets'.

Nice explanation. Care to elaborate on how bitcoin has superior network security to FDIC insured banks or are you just going to the continue bitcoin superiority without explaining why I should care about algorithmic functions vs any standard value?
