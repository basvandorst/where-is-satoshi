This problem exists with any package management system, nothing to do with git.

I don't feel it's a "problem" worth solving. git already stores all the history of the repository, so it's not like you're going to be missing it at any given point. However, if the issue is "I have dependencies that I need to fetch" then you've already failed at some fundamental parts of the development process:
1. You are suddenly depending on a bunch of dependencies that you didn't have already.
  * To further elaborate, you are probably working on a flawed package management system that has github URLs as sources for a package. This is the fault of the maintainers of the package management repository. This is a social problem, not a technical one.
  * 99% of the time if you are using a scripting language (which is usually the source of all these dependency-hell issues), you are just fetching a package with some metadata. Git repositories are for source control, you don't put fucking packages in there.
  * Any language that has a semi-official package manager hosts their own packages. If those go down, you're screwed anyways.
1. Do you really have push/pull requests that are so important, that during development you cannot wait until github/bitbucket/sourceforge comes back up? Since you can't access the site, nobody else can, so really it's a non-issue.
1. This same problem occurs when you lose network connectivity. A storm knocks out some lines and you can't access the internet. Problems 1 and 2 still exist.

Yes, this project is silly and pointless. He's trying to solve a problem with git when it's really the package management systems and scripts that rely on github that are the problem.
What happens if your debian/rpm/pacman repos for your OS go down? The same exact thing.
