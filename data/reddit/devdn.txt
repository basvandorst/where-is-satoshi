First of all forget web-based wallets OP. Just download Electrum and you're set, all you do is open it you're ready to go, even a 5 year old would be able to set it up. Web-based wallets are untrustworthy and you don't have absolute control over your bitcoins.

Nope, I guess that covers everything thanks for your helpful information

I'll check it out then!
Just a last question, in case my machine/PC somehow crashes irrecoverably and I have to re-install windows or a hard drive fails for example, just take think of any case of disaster, would all my money be lost?

So if I want to access my BTC's from another computer all I need to do is download Electrum and input the seed code?
Sorry for being so annoying with all those questions just wanna make sure I got it down ^^

I think you're being a bit harsh telling people not to use coinbase, also what do you think of BitGo?
