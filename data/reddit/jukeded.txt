1.  $120 is fine to keep on coinbase because it isn't a whole lot
on that same page it is perfect for you to practice creating a paper wallet [using bit address](
youtube the safe way of doing it were you won't compromise your private key using ubuntu and disconnecting the internet. 
Do your research, print a couple copies of your paper wallet not just one.

bro thats the thing about reddit people think they know someone by just reading a few comments 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:43:26
it is a scam 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:00:12

@_date: 2017-12-19 18:00:35
your tired of the word but you place it in the title nice
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:30:42
you live in a bubble
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:55:02
makes me pretty mad to read about this happening because of roger ver and their team trying to copy everything about bitcoin including the name, sorry this happened to you!
Like i genuinely like the idea of BCH because of their technology but all of the shady shit they do makes me want to stay away like saying BCH is the real bitcoin causing this to happen to people in the crypto world
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:23
i have forked bch because i completely ignored their scammy operation, but since coinbase adopted it id sell it for alt coins and ethereum / bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:27:49
with bitpay its perfect , one transaction fee to bitpay and thats it
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:26:12
why would everyone stop buying? fiat value lessens each year while the bank charges you fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:42:25
a crash is not inevitable, it is just possible and by the looks of it, so is the recovery 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:46:56
with how bull volatile bitcoin is i don't think so
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:29:30
As a new person to join this sub reddit if i were to see this post , "ceo of bitcoin.com" he is hurting BITCOIN / Crypto all around. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:32:45
i got banned from btc , your point? this sub reddit is for real cyptocurrencies not pump and dump scams , they tried to destroy bitcoin without realizing that if it were possible (its not, bitcoin is too strong) for bitcoin to "crash" or "die" all faith will be lost and never restored to the crypto community in general for ever  , but somehow it blows passed their minds . All they did was make alot of people lose faith , look at all the currencies they all dropped 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:26:44
well he has his pockets in BCH now so that's why, no other particular reason than his pockets inside bch
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:35
its all good, if you want ill buy off you at 17k 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:31:17
wrong, you should see whats happening in venezuela with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:50
blatant manipulations , go and put your money with these fraudsters and be scammed 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:28
lmfao probably from roger ver and his team , and we can all be certain that the sell orders of their team will be supplied with FIRST if not right now
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:26
how? baseless statement 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:32:06
he does hold BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:43:43
To really dumb it down
there's something called a paper wallet were you are your own bank
you will hold something called a private key (really sophisticated password) with this key and only this key you can move your funds around. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:11:32
alot of people already lost alot of money for selling low and boom right back up to 17k+ . meanwhile roger ver and their team are manipulating the markets and somehow they got coinbase in on it . HODL Strong boys Bitcoin is stronger than this
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:35:34
i understand you, we have a better understanding of our own currency not .00000000448234888
even if they don't trade in CAD it should be BTC/ETH with the option to view it as BTC-&gt;CAD/ETH 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:04:42
I was only able to purchase at 16k didn't catch the 14k ride
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:39
good luck on that venture , they are manipulating those markets hard i stay away from fishy shit like that, i am really glad coinbase picked up bch i can now sell it easily (fork bch) when it opens up for some ethereum and litecoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:14
i was able to buy in bitcoin at 16k but some other lucky bastards caught the panickers and bought at 14k so lucky
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:19
'nothing can fix this' yet a fix is already underway, fud at its finest . 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:01:12
trust me i know i can't even keep my favorite song of tori kelly on there without deleting my bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:22:38
lighting network , its actually being worked on right now, just give it some time, in the meantime you can use altcoin or ethereum .  
dont fall for the bcash pump and dump scam 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:32:34
right?  WRONG
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:20:10
Yeah i know right, such a criminal fucking organization . Almost all of government is right about now. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:30:24
Well at the current transaction fees i wouldn't even bother , wait till coinbase implements segwit . 120 is not a whole lot so i wouldn't care to keep it on coinbase, anything about 1000 offline wallet / own your own private key for sure

@_date: 2017-12-18 20:19:22
relax they are absolutely not a scam, my guess is almost 80% of all people uses coinbase, this time of year at this price it will take longer than usual but you'll get your bitcoin at the exact price you bought them, for now you are welcome to consider yourself a hodler !
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:36
shows how bad their dev team is
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:46:24
no that would be a huge mistake as the big players are just getting their hands wet
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:18:59
transaction fee sure and for now, people think its the end of the world. They will fix it
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:40:45
i don't like any of it, it's accepting the term 'bubble' 
which the media uses to taint btc
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:48
regulations just open up for the rich people to get into the pockets of the regulators 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:28
 the laptop of one of the creators of silkroad was a samsung 
We should burn down the samsung building as well 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:58:54
 
i found it, but it wasn't 4 bitcoin it was 3.3 . it matches your IP and location
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:55:24
Just look at the people representing bitcoin cash and the dev team . diversify invest little bits in all cryptos you wish but even roger ver has his majority in Bitcoin and that speaks in itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:02
i really doubt people will dump infact i think they will buy lol to be fair it seems like coinbase adapting this currency will make it spike even more
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:52:53
wait.. i did turn to bitcoin to replace a worthless national currency, 30 years of inflation makes 1 dollar/.50 cents. and 1million/500k 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:05
the people behind it yes, they are attacking us and hoping we switch over to their currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:23:26
But not bcash, thats supporting fraud, theft, and confusion . 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:32
its all a game, dont be a weak hands person alot of people have already lost alot of money for panicking 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:24:19
Woah? please tell me you do not use coinbase as a wallet for big amounts.
If you do go read mt Gox wiki 
offline Paper wallet is fine 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:24:50
super mario coins
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:16
Good time to sell before they dump the pump and dump scam
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:34:15


Then the dip comes and the purchasing begins 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:32
We all need to sell our forked bch for more bitcoin or support ethereum, so the coinbase pickup is fine with me, they can take the losses
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:03:01
you should buy an entire bitcoin at this point 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:39:21
you mean bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:07:07
bitcoin has a 100% recovery rate and breaks its own ATH record 100% within a year all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:59:03
stop with the miss leading title weather you know it or not you still spread fud in this way if people don't click
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:33:47
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:02:34
Theres another option, with so many Visa cards backed by your bitcoin (bitpay) you don't have to sell you can use your profits while they still remain invested which is way better than fiat.

lmfao i literally spit out my water on that last comment
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:03:37
yep locked out for fraud
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:03:26
congrats you just potentially paid for your own hack team to try every attempt to hack you 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:25
Or you can support ethereum with an amazing development team unlike bch with an amazing scam fraudy theft team 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:22
its blatant manipulation relax 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:11:20
your out so why are you here? bitcoin has had a 100% recovery in a timely manner . good luck to you!
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:04:27
sure you send the bitcoins overseas and sell them for cash than you smuggle them in usd back into the united states and tell the irs you found it on the floor
Or renounce your us citizenship and then you cash out
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:28:43
Congrats i've tried posting a few times and it gets deleted automatically, i am trying to find out why there are only 3 companies selling hard wallets and are based in EU when will a US based company make a wallet
