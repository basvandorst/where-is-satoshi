I just checked and all of the words are on the version 2 list. What do you mean about the hash and certain value?
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:14:48
I do not even use a smartphone. Definitely Electrum. I can say that with 100% certainty.

From: 
 "It is possible to fall back to 12 words seedphrases by making the wordlist longer (about 2600 words are needed)"
@_date: 2016-08-22 22:35:15
I am pretty sure I restored in the past, but I can try. Where do I find the word list?
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:00:04
What if the other copies say the same code?
@_date: 2016-08-30 02:53:55
I got it working. Old version had a word the new version didnt have.
@_date: 2016-08-22 23:45:35
100% sure I used Electrum.
@_date: 2016-08-22 20:50:18
I added a 13th word and it didn't give me a next button anyway.
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:04:43
I copied the list from electrum three times and hid them. I used one of the hidden lists at one point to recover the wallet. Today I recovered another of the lists from a hiding place, but this one does not work. All of the words are on the list though for one word I cannot tell from my handwriting if the word is "ten" or "tell". I have tried both in my attempts.

That website said invalid mnemonic. I will have to check with my other hidden copies.
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:10:37
None worked.
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:33:44
I've recovered with this list before I believe. Is there any alternative?
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:15:25
i quite agree, and I will do more work to figure out the error. Is there anything I should do in the future to avoid this besides be more careful?
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:57:32
I used a list that this list was a copy of. I will try the older version, but what if it does not work, and I cannot find a typo?
@_date: 2016-08-25 18:20:48
right now i am busy. I am going to try again in a week. I will let you know if I have a problem. There is only about 1k in there anyway. Thank you for all your help.
@_date: 2016-08-22 21:25:27
I have done it so many times that this seems impossible.
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:45:22
idk. I ended up using the one on the blockchain website and it worked like a charm.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:12:05

ty sorry to spam.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:14:58
electrum. I will make it .5mbtc/kb
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:32:48
How long will this take?
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:23:43
blockchain.info i suspect. More words: eels, rage, ignitions, hopkinton
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:52:16
there are words on there like "grafts" that are not on the list... hmmm
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:08:24
The article wouldn't have been posted if the price were shooting up meteorically. Hell, the article probably wouldn't have even been written.

Thank you for the advice. Is there a safe wallet you would recommend that will allow me to quickly transfer the bitcoins to the wallet and then to the site?
@_date: 2015-02-19 23:56:48
Yeah I know I am a fish out of water, but I have no choice because the easiest site to make money on is bitcoin only.
@_date: 2015-02-19 23:18:03
That sounds awesome, but I am so not tech savvy that I do not even know if I am on IOS. I have an android phone and PCs. Are either of those IOS?
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:53:30
How about BTChange? 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:22:24
Coinbase has followed transactions through multiple wallets.
