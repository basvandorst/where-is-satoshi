First time I've ever seen someone of your ilk defend chattel slavery. Usually, you blame the Jews for the slave trade or argue "we should've picked our own damn cotton" but it's nice to know there are still some people stupid enough to die on this hill.

There are numerous historical instances of this happening, although mostly in West Africa and Ethiopia. But that's not the point here-- we're talking about black people living in South Africa during the time of apartheid. They weren't all living on government handouts. They contributed to the economy, worked for wages less than what was paid to whites, and only asked for fuller participation in their own government, one controlled by a tiny elite majority of foreigners. And your assertion here:


Would classify anyone who worked (contributed to the South African economy) as a citizen.


Yeah, the good old 1800's and its racial egalitarianism and leftist propaganda... what planet was this happening on? Most Europeans at the time thought black people weren't even people.


I don't want to genocide anyone but sad to say that's not everyone's sentiment, it seems.

The reason South Africa ended apartheid is that "enlightened, civilized, advanced" white European societies had been preaching self-determination and democracy for three centuries by the time the policy ended, while hypocritically denying those things to peoples within their societies. There was immense international pressure against apartheid because of this. It's just a matter of ideological consistency. If South Africa and Rhodesia had been fascist one-party states that openly didn't give a damn about their subjugated black populations then keeping apartheid and white colonization would've been fine. But the pretension of democracy allowed black Africans to get their foot in the door and actually make those countries put their money where their mouths were.
By the way, don't use "we"-- "we wanted the best for you, we wanted to teach you"-- you weren't there. You weren't a part of that "we". All white people don't think the same. You don't know what everyone's motives were. I honestly think you wouldn't have genuinely given half a shit for the life of a "glorified ape" back then if you don't now.

Your victim complex is so large the gravity from it is pulling my eyes up into my head.

Austria isn't slavic
Western European isn't a racial group or even an ethnic one.

There is no evidence for either claim but I never made the second claim while you made the first one. When did I say Africans ever made a moon landing?

I'd like to find a single credible source that recounts the history of European colonists planning the construction of ziggurats in Mesopotamia in 2900 BC

Nobody denies that the percentage of Caucasian people is going down globally in the next 50 years as a proportion of the population, but the same is true of Japanese, Korean, Iranian, Brazilian populations as well. India and China are leveling off. Africa will explode with 2 billion more people by 2050.
My issue is that you see a general trend of declining birth rate (not even declining numerical population) and term it a "genocide" when that would be under no circumstances a genocide of any kind.
