Years ago I ran a non-exit relay on the same IP I did normal Internet activities. It's true that *if* you should be treated differently for running a relay, that should only be the case where you are an exit. However, it seems many sites used something like [this]( and treated users differently if their IP was on the list. A few years ago, dan.me didn't have the "You WILL upset people".

OP isn't suggesting you run a Tor node, just that you install Tor and have bitcoin available as an onion service. 
It allows people to access your node through Tor if they feel it protects their privacy better. 
If you have Tor installed just as a client, you wont relay anybody else's traffic. If you are a Tor relay node, you will. It can eat up your bandwidth and start getting you treated differently on various websites.

By the same "not 1.0 yet" metric, Tor is still beta. However, it has had lots of papers written about it and improvements made thanks to the papers.
I don't know that I can think of a piece of software that is used to project your security/privacy/anonymity/etc. that is 1.0 or greater. I think the logic is: we'll never know if every last bad bug is out.

Maybe his home internet isn't so good and he wants/needs a better-connected node?

Software center etc.

Great. Storage on a VPS isn't as cheap. Maybe his needs don't go well with a home Internet connection?

It's a headline. In a newspaper. Not Satoshi's words.

He was 100% referring to the exact front page headline for that day. 
Me and you are referring to the same article, yes. But the quote in the block perfectly matches the headline on the _physical_ newspaper on that day. There's nothing to learn from writing style or word choice. It may be perfectly fair to claim he may be British due to the choice in newspaper. I'm not arguing about that. I'm arguing that doing word choice analysis on a newspaper headline to determine the nationality of Satoshi is not valid.

Because bitcoin could continue to be just some minor payment method that techies can use online. A perfectly valid future for it IMO. It doesn't have to be go to $0 or go to $100[...]0

There's a way to create change.
This isn't it.
ninja edit: and repeating something over and over doesn't make it more true.

On linux, I just use
`mpv 
This requires mpv (very popular video player) and youtube-dl (very popular video downloader). Works great though! My cpu goes to full load (all 4 cores) while on youtube in firefox. It only uses up 1 core with mpv.
Ads are impossible. JavaScript exploits are impossible. Tracking is impossible.

I don't think it even touches the disk, just memory.

What other payment system is instantaneous and irreversible?
Bitcoin takes a few seconds for the receiver to see the transaction.  
Bitcoin takes 10 minutes to 1 hour to become irreversible.
Credit cards take a few second for the receiver to see the transaction.  
Credit cards take a few days or more to become irreversible.

Just because this stuff is available for sale with bitcoin, does not mean a significant amount of bitcoin is being used to buy it.

As far as what happens when using HTTPS everwhere: I don't know what happens if the exit refuses an HTTPS connection when the addon really wants it. I *can* say though, with the 100s of completely trusted CAs in existence, it isn't outside the realm of possibility that one is either (1) a bad actor or (2) bad at securing itself. An attacker could use one such trusted CA and generate certs for arbitrary domains. Then HTTPS doesn't help unless you use certificate pinning.

With respect to this blog post, not Tor or certain Tor nodes. But the Tor Browser Bundle.
It has already been fixed in v6.0.5 of the bundle.

The Naval Research Lab, to be exact, for the purpose of securing naval communications. They quickly realized
- the benefit to Internet users everywhere if it was an open network
- the benefit to the Navy if their traffic was not the only traffic on the network
So the concept of onion routing eventually turned into "The Onion Router", which turned into a paper presented by Syverson (Naval Research Lab), Dingledine, and Mathewson (neither was government, and at least one went to MIT) at the 2004 USENIX. Also in 2004, NRL released the code and the EFF started funding Dingledine and Mathewson for its continued development.
Not all parts of the US government are working towards reducing online privacy.

Maybe it doesn't have to be. But I've tried running it in a VM before. It is much more stable and much faster when it has direct access to the CPU and to a file system on a physical disk. Probably mostly the filesystem as I was using KVM. 
edit: and the  IRC channel will be more helpful the closer you are to running the server "the right way." Meaning: not virtualized and with a fast local filesystem.

It's relatively simple if you have
- an up-to-date Linux machine _on physical hardware_
- an SSD
- 200GB of free space on that SSD. (100GB for bitcoin data, 40GB for electrum data, 60GB for headroom)
I'm running a bitcoin node and electrum server on an Intel NUC. GNU/Linux 4.4.26-gentoo
8GB RAM, 240GB SSD.
Blocks take about 45 seconds for electrum server to process at about 30 tx/s. The only reasonably fast way to get up to speed is with an [archive]( less than 24 hours old. It would take weeks for electrum server to process the blockchain from scratch on this NUC, and the SSD would be ripped to shreds.

1. The information to calculate them is in the wallet file. You don't need to know them. All you need to know is the 12 word seed.
2. Yes if you didn't set a password on your wallet (doing so enabled encryption)
3. Yes. Those words are all that's needed to recreate your wallet

This is not really the time or place to get into an open source/closed source debate. But I'll dip my toes in.
Are you saying that if $PROJECT wasn't open source but was still free (as in beer), it wouldn't have problems? Or are you saying if it wasn't open source and it wasn't free (as in beer), it wouldn't have problems? Or something else?
I see the argument that charging money to use $PROJECT would help fund its continued development. But I think it's important it stays open source, especially when $PROJECT handles money. Besides, there's no guarantee that closed source software is free from problems or gets them fixed quickly, but you may not have been trying to claim that to be the case.

I assume if I want to support BU, I just get the bitcoin daemon from them. Easy.
If I want to support segwit and push for a UASF on 8/1/17, do I just need to run an up-to-date bitcoin core node? Any special configuration needed? edit: the answer is at
