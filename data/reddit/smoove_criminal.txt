Professionals called bankers manage the current ledger. The history of their currency and the current state of the world should tell you all you need to know about the kind of job they're doing.  Despite what a banker tells you, I think it will be unlikely that bankers will be good at managing (or even understanding) the crypto-ledger or the (publicly reviewable) code behind the scenes that powers it all. I trust in the code because I looked at it. Program or Be Programmed.

The price is being held back by crazy network congestion. When Lightning Network gets rolled out, we are going to see the price go up 2-4x in a few weeks.  It's going to be like untying a knot in a firehose.

People who are buying Bitcoin are on the other side of this bet.  I don't trust the government+banks with storing my value.  The only thing for sure is that someone is going to be left holding the bag!

Thanks for the feedback!
Re: Ponzi - I think my answer for this question from now on is "Yes, it's a Ponzi scheme, just like the dollar!  However, Bitcoin's ponzi scheme has a fixed number of tokens and a non-human mechanism to control the circulation of currency supply.  As opposed to the dollar, which doesn't have fixed limits and humans decide when more or less is made."  
Re: Miner fees.  Overall, I feel like I failed to give a good basic explanation of how Bitcoin Exchanges work and a simple "Here's how to register, purchase, store &amp; send Bitcoin" step by step breakdown of what to expect.    Will definitely add some clarity here next time and make sure to talk about exchange fee + transaction (miner) fee.
