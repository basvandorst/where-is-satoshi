He’s an elitist, a plutocrat.

We call them dips in cryptos.  I'll sell a bunch at $8k, then rebuy the next dip, probably around $7.5k.

What a buffoon. Bitcoin is well beyond the grasp of any government. If the US banned it, it would hurt the price, for a time, but then it would just blossom elsewhere, like Singapore.
Bastards like this want to go to an all digital fiat currency in order to keep the unbanked, unbanked. Crypto gives the unbanked the ability to participate in the global economy and that scares these guys to death.
This guy is part of the old plutocracy that sees Bitcoin as a real threat to their way of living, but it’s too late, crypto has already slipped through their grasp!

You will, I just bought more and I'll thank you when you buy back in high next month!

After the fork this week, I think things will rebalance. Some money will move out of BTC and back to Alts. BTC will get a healthy and needed dip and fresh money will come back in at supports. By the end of the month, I think we’ll be looking at a more normal market again, one based more on fundamentals and less on FUD and FOMO.

P2P my friend! Meet me or anyone holding bitcoin at Starbucks, who wants to change some bitcoin for cash.
You bring the public address for a wallet you setup, a million ways to do this anon, online, desktop, mobile, paper, hardware wallets, etc.
Agree on a price with your new friend and they make the transfer. Sit, drink and chat while you get a couple of confirms, give them the cash and away you go with your very clean and anon bitcoin!

Jamie Dimon is a jackass who made $19.7 Million in 2008 while the company he was president of took a $73.1 Billion bailout from the US government.
Of course he won't support Bitcoin, it threatens his way of life.  I can't wait till the first Bitcoin millionaire shows up at his country club.

Exodus is a good software wallet.
If you want more security, go for something like Trezor and use a Cryptosteel to record and save you seed.
There's a ton of options out there, cold storage is good for the bulk of your accumulation, if you're hodling, but keeping a bit in a software, mobile or online wallet is good too, so you can spend or trade it more easily.

BTC will crash back to $1k
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:04:15
Meh, 10%, wake me at 25%, oh wait it hasn’t done that since 2017.  ;)

So there's this thing called the Internet, maybe you've heard of it, still not really regulated, still doing ok, still disrupting industries left and right. Bitcoin will be the same and we'll look at charts in a few years and call this the China speed bump.
Buy and hodl my friends!

Grow up, go to college and enjoy some regular life. You should also invest in crypto, dollar cost average buy for a while, but wait for a dip below $6k, it will come next week. Buy, then forget about it. Check on it when you’re 25 and see how it’s done.
Good luck kiddo.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:51:06
Do you have some data to back that up or is it something you read on Reddit?
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:17:55
Don’t buy today, wait for a dip.
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:00:35
If you don’t want to use a hardware wallet, just download and use Jaxx or Exodus. Whatever you do, put your coin somewhere you control the private keys. Never leave your crypto on an exchange.
If you don’t have the private keys, you don’t actually own the crypto.

Crypto is way more volatile than stocks. Your only strategy here should buy and hodl!

Unfortunately the IRS currently considers bitcoin property and wants you to pay taxes on it, even if you do nothing with it.  The IRS also reported less than 1000 people reported last year so, the laws don’t work that well. Do what you think is right.

Dollar cost average a $100 purchase once per week as you can afford, but wait for a dip, never buy at all time highs. Check the charts, BTC will dip in a few days, it always does a few days after a hard run.
Then no matter what, just hodl!

Guys, read the first word of OP’s post. This is basically a fictional, fun post. ��‍♂️

It doesn’t have to go to GDAX first. Your Nano has a public address for each of the supported cryptos. You have a wallet for each crypto you own on CB. From those wallets, just transfer your BTC, LTC, or ETH to the correct address on the nano and you’re done.

If you purchase at Coinbase, your purchase will be almost instant since it’s basically a market order, so your price will be locked in. Wait an hour for the 6 confirmations and the BTC is all yours.

Check the charts for the last month, it always eventually pulls back after a big run like this.

I was mostly joking, lol, I like bating these guys.  It's hilarious when they come on here asking where prices we'll be in a certain amount of time.  If it dropped to $1k, I would also buy my ass off!
No one has any idea where any cryptos are going.  BTC is only going up over time, the Alts, hard to say, depends on the project.
