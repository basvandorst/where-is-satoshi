That's no way to talk to volunteers who maintain a system that you use. This stuff is difficult and is pushing the envelope of what is possible in distributed computing. 
Hire someone else. Have at it.

Blockchain is fairly obvious in hindsight. It was only a matter of time and would not have taken that long to be realized. What makes it so wonderful is the anonymous and decentralized circumstance.

It's still a somewhat hostile social practice. Block space is limited so if they overpay because they are taking up space then they will cause others to have to overpay, also.

What vendor waits until a credit card transaction has fully cleared before sending product? The initiation of the transaction is enough assurance for the vast majority of applications. And confirmations happen far faster than credit card transactions clear. Hours, not days.
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:39:58
That is a pending charge.
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:50:06
Yes. It's just as good if not better than a credit card transaction, which can be reversed or canceled before reconciliation. Money does not move instantly despite appearances.
@_date: 2018-08-19 05:04:56
Lower transaction fees, mostly. 2% plus 35 cents per transaction is common. That adds up. But indeed that is a big question for crypto advocates.
@_date: 2018-08-19 03:13:42
It's definitely different and not exactly the same, but it is similar. There are pre-paid credit cards and other such gray areas. I just think that if merchants were to adopt a 0-confirmation policy their overall experience and risk profile would not be very different than it is with cards.
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:27:27
Fuck off. You asked why merchants would use it. I understand the subversive aspects. Done with you because you are being obnoxious.

You'd be giving up privacy. As far as I know there is no good solution. Ether has .eth domains, which is a hell of a lot better than a QR code for things like radio or a performer asking for tips on the mic. But their addresses have similar privacy issues.

The value of Bitcoin is that it has trust guarantees that are enforced by cold, hard math. It is provable and knowable.
Gold has trust guarantees enforced by physical properties and scarcity, but it is more cumbersome and we don’t know exactly how much gold there is.
Cash has trust guarantees by reputation alone, which is constantly jeopardized by counterfeiting, government instability, and inflation.

The awkwardness of generating one-time-use addresses from extended public keys. People I know want to just stash an address somewhere like bank account numbers and send their money to the same "place" each time.
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:19:07
Wow, I see. "Economic community" as used here, unlike the "poor" inhabitants of a neighborhood (who is to say graffiti artists are poor anyway?), is not really what is generally understood to be community. We have a fundamental difference in our perspectives on property rights and community. Not an easy gap to bridge in a short discussion such as this.

Ah yes. Maybe I will tweak it to support older node versions. It uses some recent javascript conventions. Thanks for spelling that out. You could also use a node PPA on Ubuntu to get a recent version.
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:03:01
You missed the point, which is that in a city "private" property is usually part of the public experience and vice versa. The community in a sense "owns" their culture, which is reflected in its self-expression. This is way more legitimate than advertising because people live with the graffiti they make. And yet advertising is normal and tolerated by the powers that be. Advertising is not self expression and it is not the product of the community that inhabits the spaces. Check out the documentary. It might illustrate a different way of looking at graffiti better than I can in this medium.

There are a few of these sorts of things floating around, written in various languages, but the code for them was not as modular for hacking on as I would like.
It has data source modules for Crypto Compare and Coin Market Cap.
currentsee doesn't have a ton of features at the moment, but it achieves the main goal of being lightweight and sipping battery power when I'm out working all day. PRs are welcome.

But corporations slathering ads all over on buildings and billboards is OK? Did you know that many ads are posted illegally by gorilla agencies? And the "legitimate" ad spaces are still visible from public and private property alike.
The documentary Vigilante Vigilante really illustrated this phenomenon.
In New York graffiti and mural work is increasingly used by megacorps to get their products in front of eyeballs. Graffiti is a form of expression. As long as corporations can intrude and muddy the cityscape on a massive scale, I say the real people can have their tiny tags here and there... in their own backyards.

lolz. Fine. What's one more npm package on npmjs.  Published.
The histogram is showing the relative intensity of movement up and down over the update interval. The density of the three "block" ascii characters ░▒▓ represent the "intensity" of the movement while the color represents the direction.
It's not technically a "histogram" but, whatever.

He used 20 million, not 21 million...
Did he do that for easy math or because he subtracted Satoshi's coins from circulation? Meaning he knew Satoshi never spends them.

Pretty much. Unless you count digital things distributed physically like that one Wu Tang album.

You can store the QR codes or TOTP seeds in a secure place (not where your passwords are!) and use them to re-create your 2FA on a new device.

Not exactly. You always bought just a license, even with physical media.  The media is an artifact, a license delivery mechanism.
Michael Jackson bought the actual music of the Beatles. He secured the publishing rights (the song itself). The other aspect of music as we think of it are mechanical royalty rights (the recordings). 
If you own the publishing, you get paid for performances and covers of songs in any form. If you own the masters, you can distribute the particular recording in media and grant licenses for its use. If you buy a license to a master, you are given rights to use the  master for personal enjoyment.

Oh yeah. I pay more in tax to New York City than I do to New York State every year. Huge mountains of bags everywhere with rats all up in them.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:02:48
I don't know what you mean by "what do you call..."
The word "public" is pretty dubious. From my vantage point, I don't particularly care about the things that taxes pay for. Some of them are definitely "useful" and "beneficial". What I care about is the fact that these things are paid for with money taken from people by force.

Yeah, you can never rest with your knowledge. You have to lead your sights, so to speak, and identify up-and-coming technologies that are cusping in that early adoption phase. Sometimes you pick the wrong horse and have to play catch up. If you're good, you consistently pick tech to learn that becomes indispensable in the broader industry.

There are many better examples of things that are difficult to maintain in modern infrastructure but for some reason everyone chooses potholes, which are super simple to repair. 
Cheaper or even better isn't the issue. Ethics is the issue.

Surly is carried through Quality Bike Parts, so Step 1: find a shop that takes bitcoin. Shouldn't be too hard. Step  ask if they are a QBP vendor (most likely). Step  order that bad boy.

There is nothing magical about taxes that enables society to maintain. If trash collection is important to you, I think you could find a way to pay the trashman without government taking it from you by force. Theft is unethical.
