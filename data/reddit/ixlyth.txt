He is referencing that not every 256-bit number is a valid private key, but that valid private keys range from 0x1 to the number he quoted.  Therefore, only 99.99999999999999999999999999999999999962655446549599% of the range of 256-bit numbers can be used as a valid private key. 
Rolling a 256-bit number that falls outside the valid range would be extremely unlucky!

* 1) They shouldn't base their ultimate decision on core devs alone, but upon the fact that their is a large amount of users and businesses who don't support the NYA
They didn't say that.  They said:


* Core devs certainly aren't opposed to future hard forks or future sane blocksize increases as they suggest
I'm not seeing that they implied Core dev opposition to hard forks or blocksize increases - they instead imply only that the [Core] developers didn't subscribe to the NYA agreement.  Later in the statement:


Is Bitwala pleading to Core Devs that they embrace NYA?  That seems to be one implication.

I agree with you that the part about Luke not using Bitcoin is the most trolly part of his comment and should have been omitted.  However, his comments about Luke are beside his main point.  His main point is that the cited poll lacks credibility and/or utility.
Isn't that a valid argument considering the poll has a sample size of 275?  And on the NYA questions, the sample size is less than 40? 
I don't know how this poll was promoted.  But, if it was promoted in a fashion where a disproportional number of "small blockers" saw it and were motivated to vote in it, then that would obviously skew results.  Is that the case here with this poll?  If so, isn't that a valid criticism of the poll's utility?

I don't find this statement convincing without links to the polls.  The "poll" you held in June has no value.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:39:13
No.  They were clear on this point:


They explicitly state that they will follow their customers - not Core devs.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:42:32


The linked poll has no value for at least two reasons:
1)  The poll is linked to a twitter user that is blatantly in favor of small blocks.  Correspondingly, the poll's results will likely be skewed by the higher proportion of "followers" in the sample population that are predisposed to agree with the twitter user.
2) The question is asked in an obviously biased manner.  This also skews the information in obvious ways.

Public statements like Bitwala's are worded with careful deliberation.  The language can be a very tricky to decipher.
The key word in "we will not actively fork away" is "actively."  They are expressing that they will not make any special or concerted effort to fork away.  It leaves open completely the possibility of remaining 
"passive" and still forking away (to a protocol that Bitwala admits would not be "bitcoin"). 
The rest of the statement you quote affirms Bitwala's intentions if Core devs *DO* decide to subscribe to NYA.  The portion you quoted is silent on Bitwala's intentions if Core devs *DO NOT* decide to subscribe to NYA.  
You are reading into the statement more than what Bitwala said to conclude they stated an intention to renege on NYA.

How can you be certain it will be the S2X chain the exchanges choose to not support without 2-way replace protection.  Couldn't they instead choose to not support the Core chain?

In the scenario you outlined, the miners (providers of the "sufficient hashrate") are the ones who murdered Bitcoin.  Therefore, the miners would become your dad.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:12:25
I see, but I'm still confused.  Who is the "them" that would be stealing people's bitcoins?  2x developers?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:40:48
That's outside the scope of the statement.  Bitwala isn't making a prediction, they are stating their intention.
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:08:52
Yeah, right.  How do you suppose he got up there?
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:49:45
No.  Bitwala's statement is impressively well-written and means exactly what it says and nothing more.  One cannot parse it anyway they want; not if you believe words have meaning.
However, one certainly can contort the message to match any pre-conceived notion simply by projecting their own biases onto the writer's words.

Both BCC and Segwit-only as a plan A were unable to secure 90+% miner support.

What is it exactly about his opinion that makes it trolling and lies, and how is that different from your opinions?
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:40:50
Here are my opinions:


My understanding is the same as yours, but I could also be wrong.


"No developers" isn't the same as "no current developers."  My understanding was the Jeff Garzik (were there others&gt;) agreed to aid with development.  Bitcoin developers are not static; they have always changed and will continue to change with time.


I would guess most of the signatories did not anticipate Bitcoin Cash, as that wasn't public knowledge.  Antpool's UAHF was known at the time.


I see this claim often, but no evidence that it is true.  I am open to seeing the evidence if you (or anyone) has any.  Specifically, I want to know what clause in the agreement it breaks and who broke it.  My understanding is that the HKA contained a clause that forbid concurrently supporting alt-coins or competing implementations of bitcoin; but, the NYA contained no such clause.


I see statistics thrown around like this, again, with no evidence to support it.  You have further narrowed the statistic to the "technical community at large."  Do you have any source for this 1% number?


Remember, the individual signatories are their own distinct entities making decisions for their own organizations.  There cannot be a collective answer to this question.
But, ShapeShift has made their position known.  Their priority was ONLY to get Segwit and a 2MB blocksize increase implemented.  Shapeshift has stated that they largely admire the Core developers, and that their motivation for signing NYA has nothing to do with changing dev teams.
As far as dumping the rest of the development team - there are any number of ways that this is unlikely to happen.  Some current devs may contribute to btc1.  Current devs may implement the new consensus rules into Core and take back control from btc1.  
I think it is least likely that the current dev team will vanish even if they lose this battle - because they haven't lost the war.  The war it Bitcoin vs Fiat.  In fact, it is important that the community remember that we are really all on the same side whether you support Bitcoin Core, Segwit 2x, or Bitcoin Cash.

Improved privacy and fungibility are examples of improvements Bitcoin should have been working on for the last 2+ years rather than bickering endlessly over the scaling issue.  There has been a "good enough" solution for years, but we let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:47:30
Which implementation are you talking about?  Both sides of the debate have the ability to add replay protection, and neither side has a duty to serve the other.  
My understanding is that the Segwit2x devs are adding opt-in replay protection and that the Core devs are refusing to add any replay protection.
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:35:09


The NYA itself is the product of listening to and carefully considering feedback for over 2 years.  It is a compromise "solution" that doesn't fully satisfy hardcore big blockers or hardcore small blockers.  But it is none-the-less a compromise that a substantial portion of the community decided to pursue (including, but not limited to, 93% miner support) and represents the product of long-standing discussions and feedback.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:39:42
I am disappointed to see you dodge the actual argument again.  I, of course, already agree that everybody involved should act responsibly.
I have read many of your positions and I have remained open-minded.  presented a strong argument that essentially boils down to: Segwit2x is inevitable; and, to the extent that you are denying and fighting this reality, you are actually spreading more chaos and that behavior is irresponsible.
You do not owe anyone a response to this argument.  But, it would strengthen your position if you could address it directly and effectively.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:10:40


This isn't identity politics or digital tribal warfare.  He made a well-presented argument and, right or wrong, it deserves to be addressed on its actual merits.
Can you address the argument on its merits?  You can't change hearts or minds if you handwave away your opponents stronger positions...
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:52:32
This is a terrible argument!  Not even has Bitcoin Core implemented native Segwit support in their client.
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:27:40


99.9% of statistics are made up.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:13:24


These statements are absolutely false.  Segwit2x is implementing opt-in replay protection.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:44:53


This is irrelevant to his position.  He is indicating that his priority is wanting SegWit and wanting 2MB blocks.  That doesn't necessarily indicate a preference in favor of or against a change in the dev team.  This is still the case even if the Core dev team has clearly stated their position.
Take the battered wife example (this is purely illustrative and not an implication that Core devs are abusive).  A woman in an abusive relationship may want to go dancing, but her husband has stated his clear position that he will beat her if she does so.  If the woman still decide to go dancing, this is NOT an indication that the woman is consenting to or preferring a beating.  The issues are completely separate.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:46:33
By whom and how?
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:28:45
NYA also doesn't demand that you accept it or else face retaliation.  It is a path forward that some will take and others will refuse.  And it's entirely voluntary for all involved.
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:31:23
That's a fair point.
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:37:28
That is an example of conflating no-vote and/or ambivalent positions with "no support."  That is a clearly biased interpretation of the data.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:05:59


That is a separate issue.  You are right to follow whatever chain you wish.
But the argument you are responding to makes the case that it is *you* that is acting irresponsibly.  Do you dare reread and address his actual argument?  Or should your response be taken to mean, "I have the right to be irresponsible if I want."
@_date: 2017-09-22 02:00:36


Thank you!  I am impressed by the amount you were able to perceive from just two sentences.  I take that as a huge compliment.
So, to the extent you were willing to have a sincere exchange, I would summarize your position in two parts.  Remember, I am addressing only the idea that a successful SW2X deployment is "a big deal."  First:


But there is no explanation as to how it would be the end of bitcoin as we know it (aside from the possibility that the current devs may quit).  Segwit2x is still a trustless P2P crytocurrency.  It has Segwit implemented.  It has the foundation necessary for lightning networks and atomic swaps and layer-2 solutions.
What is Segwit2x missing that substantially changes its day-to-day function such that it is "the end of bitcoin as we know it"?
Your second point is:


You may be right that it means that a small handful of CEO's determined the future of bitcoin.  But I don't see why that's "a big deal" for a number of reasons.  Firstly, the future of bitcoin is already determined by a small number of people (and even that small group has changed and will continue to change over time), so I don't see a big difference.  Second, the CEO's are deeply invested in the success of bitcoin - so they are unlikely to do anything so irresponsible that it destroys the protocol.   Thirdly, I highly suspect the Core developers can take back the protocol anytime they decide; as I mentioned above, they can implement the Segwit2x consensus rules into Core and continue forward.  None of this spells an "end to bitcoin as we know it."
Maybe I'm just too concerned with the functionality of the protocol than I am with controlling it.  It is totally possible that I am wrong, but I just don't see where is "the big deal."
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:40:53
So are you unable to address the question on its merits?  Or are you, in fact, "pretending" that it's a big deal just as suggested?
I know you can't address this objectively, because your cognitive dissonance has triggered and you have an identity stake in a viewpoint that opposes reality.  You are literally hallucinating and you helpless to see it.
Don't feel bad; we all do this.  And r/btc responds in the same way when I challenge their weak positions.
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:19:05
Segwit2x is implementing opt-in replay protection.  So it may not be as tricky as you think.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:33:01
Why would it be a big deal at all?  It's all open source software.  Core can just implement the parts necessary to conform to consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-09-22 02:03:22
Yes.  You are correct.  Based on the company's involved, I had interpreted it as company's capable of implementing a centralized model, not all supporting a separate, individual model.  Thanks for pointing that out!

Analogies are only helpful for roughly introducing a new topic to someone who knows nothing about the new topic.  Anything beyond that inevitably descends into an argument over the analogy itself.

I'm all for personal responsibility as much as anyone; however, the party that was most irresponsible here is clearly Coinbase.  Coinbase misrepresented their capabilities when they promised a date to produce the coins that they did not deliver on.  While I agree that it is smart business to research Coinbase ahead of doing business with them, and doing your best to mitigate your actions versus their reputation, what actually happened here is what amounts to fraud by Coinbase, and they should be held accountable.
