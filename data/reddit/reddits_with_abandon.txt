Yeah, at least two years. ANd now that it's here, it's implemented in a way that concentrates transactions through a single company, defeating the purpose of decentralization in teh first place. Might as well be in ETH since the dream is dead here. 
Or do you think you'll suddenly be doing coffee and lunch transactions when you have no partners in payments like dozens of other coins?

And their innovation was to miss the point and remove decentralization. 
Now bitcoin provides nothing that every other alt doesn't. all the criticisms are now valid. The fundamentals are dead.

The more I think about this, the more I realize there is literally no other way this can go. Those superfunds will never grow at the pace of future inflation constantly sapping their value. There's just no way as the elderly accumulate as a percentage of our population. 
holy shit, this might be the only answer!
