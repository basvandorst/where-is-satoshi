Can’t go by one month though. BTC has some hard times at one point, that means nothing today. Truth is no one can predict the future with any real certainty.

Howso? Pizza party? ;)
I genuinely hope this works itself out QUICK. This is messed up.

He's got a bunch already but the ad is still up so I assume he's still buying! I'll PM you the details. Hahaha

It’ll dip after, going off historical data. I’ve held off buying until that happens.

I sold my wife to an Arab prince for BTC.

Fairly new to this myself, and I want to get my BTC off of Coinbase before the split in case they end up not supporting it (and because I think it's good to have full control over my own BTC anyway). I've read the FAQ and I've seen a few posts, but I wanted to know what *your* recommendation is for where I should put my BTC? Now that the fork is upon us, I'm feeling mighty motivated.

I've been with them for four and a half years or so, and I've never had a problem. On the rare occasion I've had to reach out to their support for something, they usually got back to me within a few days and were always helpful.

Sweet! Time to buy.

Back when I signed up I only needed to upload a photo and was able to use my California driver's license as proof of ID so I'm afraid I can't help there. Definitely reach out to them! :)

I usually buy a small amount each Friday, but I'm waiting for a dip. Sometime over the weekend it'll happen (maybe).
Last Friday I forgot to, and was so bummed out that I ended up purchasing some at $4800 or something after it had been cheaper all weekend. I'm significantly less bummed out now.
I've realized that the old stock market saying is correct here--time in the market beats timing the market. Buy the dips, sure, when you're able. But don't worry about buying in and then seeing a drop after. It'll only go back up.

Red Cross? Might as well throw your money away. Look up how much "help" they gave Haiti after the quake.

Eh, as long as he makes them trust fund kiddies they'll be fine. If they get the lump sum, yeah, that'll mess em up.

All American MSM is American propaganda.
I find that RT is propaganda when discussing Russia. When discussing anything else they seem more balanced than what the "news" will give us here.

This is very helpful, thank you!

Beautiful, thank you!
