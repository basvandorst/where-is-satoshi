Heard they're malicious ads though
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:22:16
oh right
@_date: 2016-04-05 11:17:53
Hmm.. How did you get scammed?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:14:33
True, no way to keep Salah quiet
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:54:52
Baby you're a rich man 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:52:12
debit card 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:36:37
Look at all the bedwetting downvoters.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:06:31
How's that gonna happen
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:08:14
Liverpool 1-1 Everton
@_date: 2016-03-22 21:13:01
No, I originally synced it years ago, I never use it so it's syncing again..
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:46:47
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:06:18
It's only 10p
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:57:12
What's bad about online wallets? I only purchase things with Bitcoin monthly, so I just get annoyed when waiting for Core to sync, that and disc space. Other than that it's fine
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:07:33
How much cache would you recommend?
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:55:11
I've still got it on my core address though so I can just transfer it when it becomes of worth...
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:23:52
I mean what I was unable to send is only valued to 10p, which is equal to 14 cents in US currency..
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:12:37
Should I upgrade if I'm waiting on a payment?
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:50:37
Core is bad, takes ages to sync and takes up CPU space.
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:38:36
Why are you making a big deal out of this? I can't transfer 0.00034820 BTC, I'll wait until the value goes up. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:51:34
It's worthless at the moment anyway, so it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2016-03-20 22:01:44
I've decided I'll just stay with Core instead, syncing is a pain but I'll just leave it to do it overnight.
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:30:48
Yeah and they don't give a shit if you get carded
