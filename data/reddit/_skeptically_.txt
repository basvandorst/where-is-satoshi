God the slimey bitcoin "insiders" are so shady and rabidly greedy, it's pathetic. There's no doubt in my mind the people at bitcoin foundation, where mark was a board member, along with others schemed to screw over the customers to save mt.gox.

1. Start an exchange.
2. Lure suckers
3. Shutdown and claim "hackers" stole the BTC.
4. Profit.
5. Rinse repeat.

In that case....
Asking buffet about bitcoin is like asking the pope about god. 
is nothing but pumpers. It's a boiler room. Everything can be twisted into a positive for bitcoin.

Shows how terrible tinkercoin is if coinbase is outdoing them on price.

rtbtc "announce" was just bullshit concocted by the parasitic and slimy bitcoin insiders to get mt.gox off the news.

You should write all that information in a comment here. The hackers will crosscheck it with their data and let you know if your information has been compromised. 


What's the rush? One should learn to stop and smell the roses to truly enjoy life.
