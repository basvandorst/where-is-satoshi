SEC will forever reject a bitcoin ETF. I’m not betting on one. Bunch of idiots 
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:33:51
To be honest, these things are useless. What’s the point ?
@_date: 2018-09-21 02:42:45
Bull . Rule of law here in the US
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:32:10
Do you really feel save placing your money, crypto in their system? God save you! 
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:40:00
I do. HODL to 2040 
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:14:31
Not racist! Smart money won’t trust Binance 
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:37:52
Swedes are small potatoes, their ETF or ETN won’t make a serious difference. We want real players like in the US or China. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:04:13
Look. are you saying they are not physically delivering what they said they would?  NYSE is a scam then the whole system can just go to hell!
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:06:58
Good article. I’m sure overtime bitcoin will be so stable that its original intent of being a decentralized digital currency will come true. Bitcoin by then will be a world or global reserve currency dethroning the US dollar!
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:17:30
Bakkt is subject to regulatory approval via the CFTC, not the SEC. It’s destined to be approved and running this November. Buy bitcoins now or get left behind!
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:45:12
You’ll make the exchanges rich. Go ahead if that’s what you like to do. Good luck lol
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:44:43
If they do, bitcoin will thrive 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:37:07
It’s the REAL bitcoin , so they say 
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:54:16
Institutions are also being babysitted by the SEC. it’s clear that we are now living in a nanny state in most respects.
@_date: 2018-09-15 13:23:06
So confident to say it WILL rise to $8500 by year end. Really?
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:26:25
I’m thinking bitcoin to $91,000 in a few years time. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:07:17
Yes to the moon folks 
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:49:41
I lost confidence and respect for Binance due primarily to all the twitter spam posting by their promoters. Like I’ve said earlier, it makes them look bad, like a boiler room organization. It’s best to stay away from companies that promotes their services via spamming!
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:40:21
Rule  never buy bitcoins, rule  don’t forget rule  Going to zero lol
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:20:09
It’s coming folks, bitcoin passing $10k by November, all because of Bakkt. If it doesn’t, I’ll eat up my coins live on YouTube. Lol
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:07:58
The owner, founder of Binance is a Chinese man from mainland China, specifically Shanghai. Binance is therefore Chinese controlled crypto exchange. I would steer away from them including the likes of BitMex etc.
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:57:59
Spread the pumping action. Get it all the way to $250,000 and I’m out 
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:25:36
He sounds like a guy who is down big with his crypto investments. He’s trying to jumpstart another round of FOMO. This time with institutional money. Only time will tell if he’s right. I’m thinking he may well be due to Bakkt coming online this November.
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:36:09
True and yet every Tom, Dick and Harry is begging for an ETF. Bunch of fools! Bakkt is the real thing! And best of all, we don’t need the SEC’s blessing. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:25:44
Why bother doing business with a Chinese crypto exchange? You people are risking your assets there! Go to regulated Coinbase or Gemini!!!
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:32:33
It’s ass here in good olé USA bud!
@_date: 2018-09-21 16:53:36
Bitcoin investors are waiting and hoping to see the gush of institutional capital flowing into bitcoins, not from retail mom-and-pop type investors. We already have enough of the latter on platforms such as Coinbase, Binance and etc.
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:02:42
Yup that makes good sense 
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:21:04
Lol jk it’s heading to 8500, if Bakkt is a success 10,000 easily.
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:11:50
It’s all over the news !!!! Google it
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:59:37
Not for you little retail buyers. It’s geared towards institutions like banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, family offices, and high net worth individuals. They trust the system to be built by the parent company of the NYSE! 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:48:14
Show off by losing it all. Smart 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:49:06
Too soon minor

This man is turning into a John Mcafee # 2. Lol
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:04:31
Neither 
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:47:26
Based on 1% of the Internet’s population adopting bitcoin, we get $91k per BTC.
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:02:51
You can buy it through your brokerage account. No need to buy through a crypto exchange and store there. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:27:55
This is better than a bitcoin ETF!!! I’m buying more bitcoins and HODL 
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:50:37
I lost confidence and respect for Binance due primarily to all the twitter spam postings by their promoters/marketers. Like I’ve said earlier, it makes them look bad, like a boiler room organization. It’s best to stay away from companies that promotes their services via spamming!
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:56:14
Ok verify by then it’s 10k , too late lol
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:00:07
We are not getting a bitcoin ETF, if ever. One thing we are sure to have is one-day settlement bitcoin futures and custody solution via the upcoming Bakkt system to be unveiled this November, by NYSE parent company Intercontinental Exchange ICE.
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:17:00
I meant year 2040. By then, each bitcoin probably $700,000 or more. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:23:02
This is the most bullish catalyst for bitcoins to date, and yet, nobody seems to care!!! When it goes live this November, the naysayers will all feel really stupid!!! $15,000 US dollars per bitcoin year-end price target.
@_date: 2018-09-21 02:45:26
You have to pay a steep premium to own bitcoins via GBTC. Thanks, but no thanks.
@_date: 2018-09-15 13:31:51
This article is old news bro. It’s been updated to 8500 by year end.
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:41:20
Dumb ass 
@_date: 2018-09-29 13:22:20
Why bitcoins are mostly accepted from run-down businesses? 
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:20:46
You are the shit.
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:28:22
That’s what the numbers tells us, however most multi-millionaires are not believers. It takes serious time for full adoption and acceptance. Until then HODL 
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:43:20
Here we go again, delay delay delay... followed by reject reject reject. Why don’t they just come out and say we will never allow a bitcoin ETF. The SEC is run by a bunch of Obama holdovers. Lol 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:47:16
F the lambo 
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:12:36
Yes I meant those Walmart bitcoins lol
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:10:10
The purpose right now for most is to make a fortune in bitcoins then convert into fiat to spend haha
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:43:42
Please go away lol scammy 
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:15:08
Haha they are Chinese still lol
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:32:40
Warren Buffett said a year or so ago that human greed will always find ways to create more of something, and that includes bitcoin. So the idea that bitcoin is now considered scarce/limited/capped supply, don't mean jack if and when Wall Street gets to financialize it over time.
@_date: 2018-09-08 14:11:08
The gist of the author’s original post is don’t bet the farm on bitcoin. Buy a responsible amount. Invest in other assets like the S&amp;P 500. Is that so hard to understand?!
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:27:45
Please deny it. We don’t need a bitcoin ETF. We will definitely get a 1-day settlement bitcoin futures contract in November through Bakkt. That’s the one and only one we will ever need. So please stop the FUD over a bitcoin ETF!!!
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:23:58
That’s the end of the world as we know it. Won’t happen!!!
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:26:24
HODL to 2022 at minimum. Preferably buy and hold to 2030.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:00:01
What if you are a HODLER at $19,500? Yeah right 
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:12:38
Easily $250,000 by 2022... get a hold as much as you can right now ... we’ll never see these prices ever again. I’m so certain about this. I’ve full conviction in bitcoin. Not turning back , looking forward ten years!!!
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:43:52
When you buy bitcoins through robinhood, you don’t actually own the coins directly. It’s just in their name. You can’t move the crypto coin out to another wallet. It’s just for trading within robinhood. A stupid service if you ask me. Same for Square cash app too. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:34:56
If Coinbase rips me off, I’ll sue them here in the states. If Binance rips you off, where do you go? To some third world republic where the scammers can buy protection from local government officials??? I rest my case.
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:53:42
Goldman Sach is fooling you guys. Haha now we get them cheap lol
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:46:14
The US dollar is the de facto world reserve currency. I’m sure your nation’s currency is down huge this year. Good luck to all emerging markets
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:38:34
I might add one more thing, traditional crypto exchanges are not happy with the upcoming arrival of Bakkt because Bakkt is everything that the exchanges can’t do, like institutional class custodial services, and clientele through traditional finance infrastructure.
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:06:52
Wtf are you talking about? You are not making any sense. Idiot
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:46:44
Dumb ass 
@_date: 2018-09-03 22:03:03
Bitcoin is the only financial asset that you are in full control of. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:15:15
Wtf r u talking? 
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:38:59
I do. HODL to 2040 
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:37:15
Look at all the spam twitter posting from Binance and their likes, BitMex. A quality crypto exchange like Gemini or Coinbase doesn’t do that. It sure makes Binance looks like a boiler-room type operation. Bakkt will put them all out of business eventually.
@_date: 2018-09-27 22:32:52
“Funding secured” my ass! Dumb CEO 
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:01:07
$20k in bitcoins at today’s prices is a lot safer than in previous years. I would be a buyer down here, no question about that.
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:33:15
Then you shouldn’t buy bitcoins. Buy for long term hold only. If you’re into short term trading, go learn how to daytrade equities.
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:35:24
This guy is talking tripe! Banks do not shut you out based on your political beliefs. They kick you out of the system for probably writing bad checks.
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:17:15
Do you think a regulated US investment fund will place their assets in Binance? Lol of course not! They would with Bakkt! Long bitcoins long term
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:26:55
It’s ASS not Arse. Lol 
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:14:00
Oh please, get your facts straight. They are mainland Chinese company moved to HK to avoid Beijing regulations.
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:38:36
He’s mainland Chinese , there’s no doubt about that 
@_date: 2018-09-21 01:06:21
It’s insured
@_date: 2018-09-11 21:19:22
What do you expect from a fake news organization along with the failing New York Times!
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:10:22
Nope this time is for real. Don’t be such a fool. This is a trusted system, a proven one, not some startup crypto hedge fund product. More Money will flow into the ecosystem begets more wallets, stabilization of the price, followed by eventual  adoption over time. Think 10 years from now, not day by day, or month by month!! Be smart I’m buying more and holding long term.
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:45:56
The US dollar is the de facto world reserve currency. I’m sure your nation’s currency is down huge this year. Good luck to all emerging markets
@_date: 2018-08-18 04:09:13
Imo It’s safer to buy bitcoins today than in previous years. And now is a good price point to enter the space or add to your position.
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:38:48
This is bull. I don’t believe it. Another case of pumping and then the dump which always follows.
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:39:03
You bet it is! Bakkt will back bitcoins to the moon! 
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:22:51
Well if he’s right, I’m gonna be very wealthy that I can tell you!
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:20:39
At least they are in the US, a truly rule of law nation unlike china 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:46:23
Is he asking for a monetary donation? Does he accept dogecoin? Lol
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:39:10
NYSE ICE Bakkt’s involvement definitely brings in more liquidity to bitcoin, and hopefully less volatility over time. All in all, it’s strong tailwind for this new asset class for sure. I’m adding to my bitcoin position down here in the low $6ks. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:09:21
‘Rat poison squared’ and the NYSE is building a platform for the trading, storing and spending of bitcoins. One man’s view against an organization that owns the largest stock exchange in the world. Case closed!!!
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:27:13
Question? How??? Lol
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:37:13
Try Gemini, but they limit you at $500 per day for ACH transfers. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:28:16
I’m perfectly normal and have a healthy mind. Your fears of the US government confiscating your bitcoins is pure paranoia. And that goes with the OP and those who shares his/her views. Go out and get some fresh air and sunshine. The world is wonderful;-) unless you are in Syria.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:07:37
Why do we keep harping about a bitcoin ETF when Bakkt will have a better one coming out in November that does not require SEC approval?
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:56:38
Yes yes yes HODL it
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:24:02
Alex Jones Infowars here lol you guys are nuts
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:58:11
We don’t need an etf! Stop begging for it already y’all.
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:04:04
Yes , it will bring bitcoin to the mainstream. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:07:21
Buffett’s a dinosaur. I still think he’ll get to see bitcoin’s viability in a few short years before he goes six-feet under. However, I doubt his sidekick Munger will live to see it though.
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:56:44
Exactly!!! Why would they invest millions, if not billions, into the bitcoin ecosystem for? Obviously they see vast potential with bitcoins. This is the NYSE, not some unregulated player like Binance, Bitmex, or other no name foreign crypto exchange.
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:07:53
Smart homie lmao
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:22:36
This is likely to happen in Communist China! Not the good ‘ole USA! Doomsday idiots u
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:17:13
Long term you’ll be happy. When I say long term, try 5 years. Good nite y’all 
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:55:16
Yeah we know . There’s no diversification advantage in cryptos. When btc sells off, every crypto falls even more. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 23:03:49
I like to buy one but it may fall into the 5s this time, and possibly into the 4 handle right after. The dumpers maybe setting us up for a big flush down. I’m starting to feel the 6k bottom is shaky this time around.
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:57:13
Mr Obama holdovers, tear down this crypto wall at the SEC lol
@_date: 2018-08-06 04:08:02
Nobody seems to care. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:28:46
How are they ‘printing’ when the 1 day bitcoin futures requires that they deliver within a day? Don’t they have to buy at the spot and deliver ?! This effectively put bitcoin ETF out of business. We don’t need the SEC, we definitely need the CFTC to bring in the institutions.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:18:36
Still holding strong near $6ks.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:05:49
Twitter has many of these gurus scamming left and right lol
@_date: 2018-08-16 18:51:08
This is not true. That security is blocked by most US brokerages. Bogus Bitcoin ETN/ETF news!
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:56:20
Lol ask your government 
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:45:06
It’s never going to happen. If it ever happens, you will have much more things to worry about than your bitcoins. That I can tell you.
@_date: 2018-08-03 22:27:48
Ask your bank or google it
@_date: 2018-08-25 01:06:08
When it’s at a $1, that’s the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 01:36:13
Fiat currency is backed by the full faith and credit of a government. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:58:33
Pumper and dumper lol go try that with a microcap stock.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:02:04
By the time he’s 18, bitcoin passed the moonshot lol fomo him
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:30:26
If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen. This is only for guys with balls of steel! Fortune favors the bold, so true!
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:46:32
Of course it is, if you are a criminal. Are you? If you fear that you probably have something to hide.
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:58:17
Nope. Bitcoin is down along with the Lira.
@_date: 2018-08-12 03:02:53
I’m talking about Uncle Sam.
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:31:15
Only in China, not the USA!!! The rich Chinese are moving their wealth abroad and most of it are heading to the USA!!!
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:52:17
Bitmex maybe manipulating bitcoin prices 
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:35:04
Take a chill pill 
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:20:47
Paranoid idiots. A ship of fools. Now go hide in a bunker with cans of Campbell soups lol
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:12:20
The likely outcome: 0 for 9 lol  The SEC should just come right out and say that they outlaw all bitcoin ETF. Do not file ever again!
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:52:17
Bakkt 1-day bitcoin futures is better and likely to be approved by the CFTC, and its trading, storing and spending bitcoin ecosystem will be up and running by November this year. Buy BTC down here and hold till year end. A no brainer!
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:11:04
Tim Draper: $200,000 per bitcoin by 2022.
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:54:16

@_date: 2018-08-01 22:59:42
Maybe we will never see the highs ever again. I’m stuck at an average cost of about 7800. Sometimes I wonder what in the world did I get into. Yes I know long term investment, but the volatility is insane.
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:23:53
This guy is talking his book all the time. Scammer!

All these dinosaurs will soon live to see they were all so so wrong lol haha!!!
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:05:37
Yeah true
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:50:01
Stop it with the wolf of Wall Street video for inspiration. It’s the worse one you can use! Bitcoin is not a penny stock lol
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:48:06
They will eventually but not now or next year, eventually they all will at some point.
@_date: 2018-09-24 21:19:06
The FOMO mojo will get them into the game eventually. If not, they should be fired!!!
@_date: 2018-08-25 01:11:44
Don’t gamble with bitcoins. Buy for cash and only buy what you can afford to lose. 
This guy is a shill for BitMex.
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:40:49
Well said my man. I’m long and strong 25 bitcoins here’s a bitcoin 1 percenter who isn’t even sweating it. Nice weather out there 
@_date: 2018-08-23 12:55:52
It’s back down again lol old news
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:31:04
How a millionaire unless you buy at least 5 to 10 bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:43:26
Ok, it’s definitely because of ICE and the CFTC has already approved CBOE and CME bitcoin futures. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:10:08
I do that 24-hours a day.
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:55:55

@_date: 2018-08-07 13:21:13
It ain’t coming till maybe 2019. That is what some experts are predicting like CNBC’s crypto bull Brian Kelly. On the other hand, the SEC may surprise us by approving the bitcoin VanEck SolidX Cboe ETF. Hand on tight folks! Lambo time or going to zero! Lol
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:48:04
Silly. It goes to show you most bitcoin investor are pure speculators. Lambo my ass! Try a Bugatti lol
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:47:00
It won’t go that low ... NYSE ICE just announced the creation of a bitcoin trading, storing platform bakkk
@_date: 2018-08-01 00:35:02
I’m trying out their BitPay wallet on my iPhone. So far so good. It really works! And easy to use. I also ordered a BitPay Visa debit card. If and when my bitcoin holdings turns into a fortune by 2022, I’ll spend some of my gains using the card. ;-)
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:29:06

All these predictions are nothing more than wild guesses. Who really knows? Here’s mine, bitcoin to 4000 in June 2018, and then close out the year at 11000.

A lot of bullish predictions are not panning out. Going to zero seems to be back with Jamie Dimon chiming in calling bitcoin a ‘scam’.

I wasn’t trying to be funny. It’s nothing to be funny about. The US government does NOT confiscate personal property. You must be living in a third-world country, probably in South America! Now that’s funny!!!
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:23:50
Just hold as if you have already loss all of your investment. When you think that way, you take the emotions out of owning bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-08-01 22:56:24
Roughly 7800. I added aggressively when it was between $6000 to 6500. My breakeven at one point was about 9500.
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:04:04
Tell this Jordan Bellass to F off. The guy is a phony don’t know shit about bitcoins. What a fool! He needs to go back to writing books about penny stock scams. The only thing he truly knows about. Other than that, the scammer is a dumb ass who just wants another two minutes of fame. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:33:28
Yup just buy bitcoin and ethereum. Everything else is just pump n dump.
@_date: 2018-08-17 20:46:29
Unless you are an institution like a mutual/hedge fund, what’s the point of an etn or etf. Just buy direct and hold/store it at an exchange like Gemini or Coinbase.

Hopefully one day a regulated exchange run by the NYSE offers bitcoin trading. Until then, the Bitmex of the world will continue to screw retail investors.

It will never reach that high . Keep dreaming
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:17:51
Yeah me, about US$112k invested in cryptos, namely bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and some bitcoin cash. I’m not a trader, I bought them as long-term investments, with a minimum time horizon of at least 5 years. Day to day, or month to month fluctuations don’t matter to me. Think long-term!!!

You can now buy bitcoin using the Cash App from Square.
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:18:21
Simply because bitcoin is not a viable medium of exchange, in other words, it’s no currency yet. If anything, it’s just a possible good store of value, a commodity, like gold or silver. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:15:58
Setup ACH transfers into Coinbase/Gemini. From there you can buy/sell bitcoins, and or transfer out to a wallet like the app BitPay linked to a BitPay Visa debit card for everyday purchases.

No because a 3 or worse 1 handle is likely to happen as sentiment erodes with no near-term catalyst to drive it higher. The technicals is still bearish. I wouldn’t add any right here. I would be a buyer when full capitulation occurs, possibly at $1000.

This sounds like a Nigerian scam. He’s using you to launder the proceeds from a scam.

@_date: 2018-06-30 13:53:04
Isn’t that the case with fiat currency in banks. What’s your point? Put your paper money under a mattress? Let’s be real here. Custody of cryptos when fully acceptable will definitely drive crypto prices higher, no doubt about that!
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:51:28

These guys are the smart money in cryptos. Why is every Joe, the piker speculator, so bearish?!You all are doing these whales a favor, allowing them to snap up more bitcoins on the cheaps! For the record, I bought at the low $6k. Thanks! Now please send it to the next floor down; I’ll buy more at 5, 4, 3, 2,  and 1 lol

I ain’t selling my btc eth bch and ltc either! They can go another 25 to 40% lower and I won’t even consider. No point selling at these levels. Cryptos are here to stay folks. Use your head, think! A lot of smart people/companies are working, investing millions everyday to improve blockchain/cryptocurrencies technology. Just think before you unload your holdings! Don’t let them scare you into selling your digital assets!
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:46:24
Hopefully 40% so I can cash out at no loss.
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:32:31
Every time that Fundstrat fool or his boss comes on CNBC to pump cryptos, it’s usually the opposite days/week’s later. I would be careful not to buy at this time.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:36:48
Maybe low 5k is the new bottom before it rallies into the year-end. I’m a buyer in the 5000s.
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:17:05
Bro, my friends are laughing at me for getting into bitcoins. Time will tell if I’m the genius or a damn fool. With that said I want to say a few famous phrases... “Fortune favors the bold.”... or “A Fool and his money soon parted”.  Which one will it be? God knows!
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:28:01
Because you don’t know which way it’s going to go. It could moon shot to $100k, or flush down the toilet to $100 tomorrow. Buy some at 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. I already bought at 13, 12, 9, 8, 7, and 6. I’m buying to own the network and sell in 5 years time, hopefully many times over my cost. I’m not flipping for short-term gains. That’s peanut mentality. Think big or don’t think at all!
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:26:11
Nobody is shaking you out. The sentiment for cryptos is so bad now that selling begets more selling. However, I do believe this is the bottom at $6k or near that. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:25:15

How is it a currency now when it fluctuates in value wildly on a daily basis? How??? Tell me.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:39:05
Dream on. It won’t fall that low. Just think, millions if not billions are invested and continue to be invested in this space. If someone is selling at $5k, I’m sure there are more buyers at that price then sellers. That’s why it keeps on popping right back into the $6k handle. The buyers are the ones who believe in its future and are prepared to accumulate from the weak speculators. If you sell into the panic, you are doing the long-term investor like me a great favor. Please sell yours at $5k, 4K, 3k, 2k, and at $1k is stealing candy from a baby!!!

Sooner or later he will be right. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:15:27
Some do take delivery at the expiration of the contract. So eventually they have to purchase in the spot market.
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:53:51
You can call me the Oracle of Cryptos, forget that ico pumper nutcase Mcafee.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:53:12
I’m already a millionaire many times over. I’m a buyer of bitcoin at 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:42:50
At $1000, bitcoin mining is a dead industry together with the network.
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:48:49
Tom Lee of Fundstrat said the cost to mine a bitcoin is 6000. If he’s right, hopefully finally, then bitcoin will not go below this support price. Buy or add more at these levels! I’m holding btc eth bch and ltc long-term.
@_date: 2018-06-25 22:41:31
My average cost for Bitcoin is about $10,450. I own 5 and I have not added any down here. I may add if it tanks to $1000/BTC lol 
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:37:21
It’s a good place to put your hard cold cash into?!
@_date: 2018-06-07 00:12:09
Yes, first-mover Bitcoin will be the equivalent to gold as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:40:51
Btc is essentially gambling. Most people buy it hoping to sell to the next greater fool. It turns out I can buy but not sell because I’m a bagholder deep in the red, down by about -43%. Hopefully I’ll clear out my bag in 2022 for a Bugatti. ;-)
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:24:21
And next thing you know it it goes right back down. Traders takes profits and not worry about missing further gains which usually is the other way around.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:19:00
If the price of bitcoin is up when you bought your weed killer, then you are okay, if not you are definitely paying a lot more than using a stable fiat currency like King Dollar.
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:52:59
When the dumb crowd is skeptical, think the opposite. You’ll come out ahead far faster than the crowd. Think like an insider, not an outsider!
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:02:21
Trader life sucks. Just buy some over time and hold for at least 2 to 3 years. You’ll be very happy!
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:04:35
The guy who needs to fix his roof or get his kid an operation shouldn’t be invested in bitcoins in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:34:15
Another one is that joker from Fundstrat Tom Lee!
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:14:25
Drives a low end Porsche. He’s a HODL piker.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:59:08
Maybe in the not so long into the future, we’ll be able to really use bitcoins to purchase goods and services. Hopefully one day. HODL 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:38:51
Bitcoin recovery will take a lot longer than most believe. At low $5ks, I’m a buyer.
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:18:21
There’s going to be a day when it rallies up to 30% in a single day. That’s when FOMO sets in once again.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:25:33
Well sooner or later I’ll be right or wrong. If wrong it’s going to $500 which is essentially $0.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:20:05
At $1k something, I’ll buy double what I have now.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:49:30
Any supercar will do. However, a Bugatti will be the ultimate one for me! All I need is 10-15x my original investment.
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:44:39
They have been wrong lately. Hopefully they will be proven right this time around.
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:19:27
Up +40, down -20 the day after lol 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:52:23
The guy has a mental issue. This is what drugs can do to you!
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:13:29
BIS said in a report Bitcoin will crash the Internet. It’s not going to work so they say.
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:29:40
This statement doesn’t make any sense. It’s the market, stupid!
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:41:21
Yes it’s useless as a currency or medium of exchange, it’s more a store of value, like gold.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:04:16
You buy more! 
@_date: 2019-02-20 02:19:20
This is not a Chinese app lol idiot
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:50:32
It already has. Next leg down, 1000 per btc.
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:16:01
$2500 US dollar per bitcoin in few weeks time. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:31:51
This Brian Kelly guy should get a real job. He’s no different from all the other pumper and dumper.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:58:28
I’m calling out the bottom here at $5000s. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:28:51
Yes I’m buying some today. We are heading back to $6000s in a few months time. Keep an eye on ErisX and Bakkt going live in first half of 2019. By 2021, we may well see btc at $50,000 or higher. Time to load up 
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:51:58
No one knows how high we can go. All predictions are shit until it shows otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:04:49
Capitulation time for poor retail crypto investors. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:47:46
Turning bullish again. We may pass 10k for bitcoin by month’s end.
@_date: 2019-02-22 01:01:31
Convert your btc to fiat then pay your mortgage off in your local currency. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 23:08:19
The thing is most central banks will not allow btc to be their reserve currency of choice,
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:02:23
Bitcoin is destined to be worth easily $250,000 in 3 to 5 years. It’s so obvious 
@_date: 2019-02-09 14:51:54
Must be an old skank wearing those high heels to lure a fat ass John lol �� 
@_date: 2019-02-27 18:31:47
No more news ... seems very quiet nowadays even at their twitter handle.
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:14:05
Uh wtf
@_date: 2019-02-02 17:23:37
No one knows for sure otherwise we’ll all be rich with no risk. An educated guess tells me right now we’re at or near a bottom. You decide on your own. If you ask me, I’m a net buyer of btc down here.
@_date: 2019-02-26 23:22:37
Get back my initial capital, and hold the rest for the long term.
@_date: 2019-02-03 02:33:55
Yes it will get there soon. $1000 is the absolute bottom haha 
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:55:47
Coinbase charges buy/sell fees. There’s no way you can avoid the transaction fees when buying or selling through an Exchange. However, after buying your bitcoins, you can transfer to a wallet of your choice and pay just the miner’s fee.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:44:09
Don’t worry about me. It’s just 1.57% of my debt-free net worth.
As for others, buy within your risk tolerance.
I would be a buyer here!
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:25:52
All sounds great, but will they (the institutions) bite??? 
@_date: 2019-02-18 03:18:55
Paper trader lol
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:11:54
Mathematical certainty that bitcoin price will be substantially higher in the future, if the likes of Fidelity, Bakkt/NYSE, NASDAQ/ErisX etc continue to build out their custody and trading platforms with the eventual approval of a bitcoin ETF/ETN. Buy now!!!
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:18:27
By the way, bitcoin is NOT a company.
@_date: 2019-02-18 03:13:59
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:57:59
I call good shit
@_date: 2019-02-12 00:56:47
It’s not a coin. It’s an upcoming bitcoin trading and storing platform backed by The Who’s Who in finance. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:27:18
Do you have or do you not have the $10k? If not, go work and save up so you can buy some btc this year. If you have the $10k already, you should buy in layers, like 1/4 first, then another 1/4 every 2/3 months until you have bought a full btc. Good luck
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:44:20
I’m thinking I will probably lighten up on my btc holdings to get back my original capital when it hits $50000. The rest I will hold as a store of value for the long term, think 20, 25 years.
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:40:39

It’s going up now because Fundstrat is saying it will go down this time . Lol bunch of know nothing analyst!!!
@_date: 2019-02-19 19:38:11
Not your keys not your bitcoins, hence not your money �� lol
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:33:57
Market makers as I’m willing to buy and sell at any given time and price? No thanks 
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:01:00
Go work, safe your earnings, then when you have enough, go buy your rigs. Begging is out of the question here dude. Now if you like help from someone, ask your momma, but not strangers cause nobody will help you with something like this. Honest truth!
@_date: 2019-02-08 20:37:12
Regular folks don’t go around carrying $50k cash in a suitcase. Anyone who does that is probably guilty of something 
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:51:02
Horseshit prediction. Let me beat him at this $1 billion per bitcoin by 2020 �� 
@_date: 2019-02-09 18:59:15
It’s going down once again ... lol
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:54:59
Arthur Hayes and his crew messing up the bull run. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 17:26:28
When it’s obviously bullish, the big gains are mostly gone. You decide!
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:55:14
True dat ... we’re heading to the 2 handle , so says Tom Lee �� 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:34:41
You’ve got to have capital to stand ready to buy and sell a security as a market maker. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:13:25
It’s going to another low since the high set in 2017. As low as 2500, then we are off to as high as 68,000 in the next sustained bull run. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:08:33
That’s why we need regulated custody from traditional financial institutions like NYSE Bakkt, Fidelity Digital Assets and NASDAQ’s ErisX. Forget even Gemini or Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:32:48
It’s coming . It’s just a matter of time. Buy now folks 
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:59:16
You have a brokerage account don’t you? Soon you’ll be able to buy btc through it and store/custody there like you would with stocks and bonds. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:51:37
I read from an article where the author used Fibonacci technical analysis /indicators to predict future prices.
@_date: 2019-02-15 23:48:50
Is that an official one?
@_date: 2019-02-08 00:36:06
Yes it’s possible, and also possible it falls to as low at $180.
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:15:04
Small time speculators and not enough biggie whales to absorb the sell orders. It shows we are still not there yet. Maybe we are on our way to $2500.
@_date: 2019-02-09 13:47:32
Be a Uber or Lyft driver . Good job!!!
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:34:03
Buy, Add over time and hold for the long term.

Hey don’t be so defensive. You probably have something up your sleeve, no? Freeze , hands up, you’re arrested

@_date: 2019-02-27 23:16:28
I’m glad I left that rathole known as nyc a long long time ago. I’m never going back to the dumps ever again. It’s for socialist democrats.
@_date: 2019-02-02 15:07:10
I think we are at or near the bottom. Institutions are buying quietly down here according to an article on ErisX, a crypto trading platform backed by the likes of Nasdaq and TD Ameritrade. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:49:03
Yes HODL is a good strategy. I will probably add more overtime as a store of value. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 14:09:58
The FOMO is back and will get stronger as the week and months go by. $10K short-term Price Target. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:02:47
And then it goes right below that and can’t get pass it for good. Why???!!!
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:20:58
Wow looks like an AMEX Blackcard or Centurion card with unlimited spending power. Lol 
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:10:50
Reasonable suspicion? Again, most people don’t go around carrying that much cash on them.
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:04:20
Yeah CNN fake news for sure
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:25:16
Only $40million?! That’s nothing lol
@_date: 2019-02-11 19:04:35
Buy, accumulate and hold for 5 years minimum.
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:03:48
Uh? It’s at 3900 stop the bs  haha
@_date: 2019-04-12 21:40:08
Your base currency could be less by 25% in a second lol
@_date: 2019-04-27 13:41:50
I bought btc through them and they didn’t charge me any fees.
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:20:02
We need Bakkt fast to clean up this industry. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:30:02
Nope. It’s yours for good.

You are talking to a 12 year old lol 
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:59:49
If you’re not bullish now, soon you’ll regret it
@_date: 2019-04-27 17:22:37
Is this a joke or what? Bitcoin locked up your money lol
@_date: 2019-04-12 00:20:42
The feeling is short lived
@_date: 2019-04-22 13:05:20
Buy when it’s at $25,000 USD. Until then, watch it, wait, then buy at the top range to be certain that the bear market is really over. I’ll sell some to you at that price ;-) ��
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:55:19
Buy bitcoins not shitcoins
@_date: 2019-04-05 23:41:24
Scratch my balls Becky 
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:41:51
You are so smart. HODL to $0
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:51:33
I’ve got so much more BTC than you’ll ever have! Now go away!!!
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:29:58
I’m not sure what’s the fuss is all about for an  ETF. If your brokerage account can also buy and store bitcoin like a Coinbase, why would we need an etf? We don’t is the answer.
@_date: 2019-04-05 23:40:16
I have about 4% of my net worth in bitcoin. Hope it pans out!
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:42:01
He’s obviously a nobody with no money to buy even a Satoshi. So he comes here to diss bitcoin bulls just because it had a 5% pullback. Nothing goes up on a straight line ok. Pullbacks are normal and healthy for the markets long term viability. With that said, buy the fucking dip!
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:29:14
It may go to zero. Buy what you can afford to lose completely.
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:11:09
If the likes of ETrade, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity starts to allow the trading of bitcoins, a BTC ETF is a non event.
@_date: 2019-04-09 23:17:53
A Base cayenne. Piker!
@_date: 2019-04-04 19:51:07
Going back to the $3000s yay!!!

You have a problem with KYC? I never had a problem with them
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:46:23
Don’t worry about the daily movements unless you are day trading the asset. I bought more yesterday. I’m not concern about a few hundred dollars more or less. Looking 5 years out or longer. If it goes to $0, I lose 3.8% of my net worth. Life still goes on very nicely for me.
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:27:35
I was able to withdraw and sent a few Satoshis to my BitPay wallet. No problem at all.
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:44:49
It’s all about the Benjamins ��
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:15:04
Soon your 1 btc will be worth $2500 or less.
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:49:37
How much net daily? ��
@_date: 2019-04-27 13:36:52
$5000 is peanuts . In fact I bought a lot more through my other accounts.
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:06:43
Bullshit .. it’s insured you nitwit
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:10:00
Before you buy shitcoins, buy 1 BTC! ��
@_date: 2019-04-29 15:31:11
I know, so that’s why I move funds around to the linked BitPay Visa debit card to avoid the inactivity fee.
@_date: 2019-04-04 02:45:14
Low life

I’m not tech savvy enough, but will look into it. Thx
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:50:23
Can’t buy shit with your measly gain ��
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:50:19
It will crash again. That’s why
@_date: 2019-04-27 13:37:55
Yeah they suck balls. Hopefully one day I can start spending my btc for everyday expenses
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:06:41
At least $25000 in two years time. $1M is full of crock
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:31:19
Just don’t buy a shitcoin, simply buy a bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:15:11
That $100 in bitcoins will be worth $1300 US dollars in just a few short years. Time stamped!
@_date: 2019-04-15 03:18:33
Will we at least see $25,000? Hehe
@_date: 2019-04-13 17:50:38
Why send any btc to that address in the first place? �� send to mine, pm me lol I accept any amount. Thank you ��
@_date: 2019-04-27 15:49:01
Own a lot more at other crypto exchanges. Just HODL to a point where I’ll be spending it for the rest of my life.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:38:55
Busy buying more, accumulate at these levels. It’s heading to 6000s.
@_date: 2019-04-05 23:25:39
Many smart guys have predicted it will fall to zero. It will get there eventually. You didn’t miss the boat yet lol

If this shit goes to $14k he’ll become a smarty pants for once .  
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:11:36
Let it go to 1000 or less. The miners my as well shut down the entire network. I’m prepared to go all the way to zero. So be it.
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:53:07
Yes you can definitely withdraw bitcoin from CashApp
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:38:01
They said 95% of the reported exchange volume is a hoax
@_date: 2019-04-04 19:52:08
It’s falling again lol it’s a setup ... $3k again or less
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:12:36
You should have another note this time with the exact opposite lol good luck

Setting y’all up for a fall into the 4 handle. It’s bs 
@_date: 2019-04-27 13:39:06
It’s just 1 bitcoin. Please don’t tell me that is hell of a lot. If it was 50, sure

@_date: 2018-11-14 20:47:51
$1000 some are saying 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:16:49
I agree it’s only $1000 or less. 3000s is like 6000s to sucker in the bottom pickers. I’m waiting for $500.

I ain’t selling my bitcoins , not even a bucks worth . Go to hell 
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:10:21
Several months is a short term trader. An investor is looking out 5 years or longer time horizon. I’m an investor, and I still have conviction that bitcoin will be worth at least $250,000 US dollars in 4 to 5 years time. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:06:48
Small time ETP. It will not make a difference in any meaningful way. Jokers 
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:11:48
Unlike stocks, you generally can’t borrow or trade bitcoins on margin. If you want to buy it, you must have the cash to do so. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:33:55
Supply capped at just 21 million btc. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:50:20
360 days from today, bitcoin at $25000
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:03:55
Future contracts tend to trade closer to the spot prices as they reach expiration. They usually settle for cash and not the physical commodity. Futures are not good for bitcoins if you ask me!!!
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:12:13
Most are saying the fall is not over means the actual opposite is likely to come soon. Think this Friday, bitcoin passes $4500. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:00:01
That’s when you get in you fool. You don’t get in when retail is all hyped up! That’s when you get out. This guy is on the money with bitcoins now
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:03:48
Please stop being a piker with small bitcoin purchases. Buy big and hold for the grand prize, not a dollar baggy of 99 cents toys at Daiso lol
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:37:32
Never at 2500. At that price the miners will shut down for good and so goes the network.
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:32:34
At $1k I’ll buy 10 immediately. Give em to me y’all!!!
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:30:46
The so-called crypto pumpers are all saying institutions are buying off the exchanges via otc trading desks. I think it’s bs to be honest with y’all 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:46:53
Tom Lee stands by year end $25000. Now at 5400. Great opportunity lol

@_date: 2019-04-27 13:33:03
But if and when a brokerage firm like an ETrade becomes a crypto exchange, any customer at that brokerage can buy, sell and hold bitcoin. There’s no need for an ETF now. However, eventually I think we will have a diversified crypto ETF.

$1200 is what I’m hearing from a hedgie out in Ca

They meant $150.

This guy is a rekt along with that other dude, his partner at Morgan creek. Lol
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:07:58
People are skeptical of institutional interest in bitcoins. Hence, positive Bakkt news doesn’t help elevate bitcoin price, not one iota.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:08:30
I invested about the same as you did, but I have 10 more bitcoins than you which clearly means my cost is lower than yours. I’m in bitcoins with a long term time horizon. Think 10 plus years.

$15000 by year end so says bitcoin bull Tom Lee. He’s sticking to this year end price target �� �� 
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:22:52
Bitcoin maybe worth $0.00 at any moment. On the other hand, Apple has intrinsic value, hence its large cash position in the hundreds of US billions.
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:39:27
The 2017 20k high is not lambo. Lambo price is when BTC hits $250,000 USD per coin. Until then, let’s continue hoping and praying that one day it reaches this milestone.
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:12:46
$14,000 per bitcoin, US dollar, very realistic. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:44:54
Talking big. Then it goes lower to $100 and stay there for the next 50 years. Lol you’ll probably dead by then, no? Haha
@_date: 2019-01-24 19:58:51
Why fuck?. I rather fuck my lady than bitcoins lol
@_date: 2019-01-15 19:31:33
They charge $5 inactivity fee for their VISA debit cards linked to the BitPay bitcoin wallet. They are doing business like the Banksters!
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:19:30
At $50k I will sell some, no question about that. At the end of the day, we still live on fiat
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:27:24
$2500 will be the low before we go up big.
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:04:03
Make sure the btc you are sending to is to the right public key at the receiving end.

Yeah Millions coming 
@_date: 2018-11-13 22:08:22
You know I was only joking. I’m convinced bitcoin will be worth at least $100,000 US dollars by 2022.
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:12:20
How so!?
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:59:15
Spot prices are current prices, future prices are further out 1, 2 or 3 months out, and their prices are dictated by traders views.
@_date: 2019-01-17 22:31:00
I have an account there, and also at Coinbase. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:13:58
The poster is making up stories. Bs I don’t believe a scam that’s so stupid to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:13:16
It’s probably worth only $500 each
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:04:21
Yeah bitcoins are mostly for poor people, just like lottery tickets.  But hey, you never know.
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:28:41
Buy the Gemini Dollar
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:41:52
This is fake news. The Chinese will never allow its citizens to buy and transfer bitcoins. This goes against their effort to prevent capital flight out of their country.
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:49:05
I will definitely buy btc through Bakkt. Count me in as a client. In fact I’ll move all of my btc from Coinbase and Gemini to Bakkt for safe keeping. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:51:53

Buy buy buy every month of this year, and hold for 5 years minimum regardless of price up or down. Retire wealthy after that. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:16:14
The IRS views bitcoin as ‘real property’ like real estate. So yes you will owe a lot in capital gains when you sell/ or do an exchange.
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:14:03
You send money first, ok? Trust me, I’ll send you your 90 right after you send me first. Get it? Have a good day �� 
@_date: 2019-01-23 23:33:32
Probably $250,000 because by that time it’s gold 2.0 and wider adoption as a global permission-less currency

@_date: 2018-11-27 14:24:07
It’s not going any lower . This is the bottom $3500. Get it while it last
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:45:50
$5000 ain’t shit. I’m thinking at least $14,000 to $15,000 by year end as fair value.

It’s going to $5000 per btc very soon
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:12:08
Could it be the day Bakkt goes live and/or a Bitcoin ETF by VanEck gets final approval from the SEC? Who knows for sure but I’m sure one day it will be $250,000 per bitcoin, as early as 2022.
@_date: 2019-01-12 20:45:55
4600 and up ... will be 6430 in few months time. Don’t believe those who are predicting a crash into the $1000s, it’s bull$hit

I still ain’t selling my btc not even 1 
@_date: 2018-11-02 12:49:01
Better yet, it will send bitcoin down to $570 USDollar per coin. That’s pretty much zero for most, down -99% from December 2017 highs. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:01:59
Probably because he will likely shit on his pants thinking his investment is going to $0 and he won’t have much to live on after that lol buy only what you can afford to lose completely. I have and will HODL even if it’s at $500. Lol
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:02:13
Yeah I need that hopium all right 
@_date: 2019-01-29 13:50:42
And on top of that we get news that the Russian government selling US dollars and may buy up bitcoins from the sales is another bull shit story to fool retail. Ain’t working cause retail mom and pop are mostly out of the crypto market. This crypto winter will last a lot longer than most think. See you all in perhaps 2022.

@_date: 2019-01-08 00:42:42

@_date: 2019-01-21 16:42:22
That was a great article by IBD on bitcoins 
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:41:45
Funny that most bitcoin observers and investors do NOT believe this will be a major catalyst for the next bull run. If they did, bitcoins should probably be trading upwards of $8,000 to as much as $10,000... instead we are stuck here in the $3600 hell hole and possibly going lower as the shorts gets embolden to flush it down to the 2000s or less... Fishy eh?
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:12:18
It’s going back into the 3ssss no doubt about that 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:12:27
This is the time to get into bitcoins aggressively. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:15:11

Bought 1 full btc. Thanks for the Black Friday deal of a century lol
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:27:21
Nasdaq bitcoin futures is no different than the ones by the CME and CBOE launched late last year. This is not good for the industry. I think the one that hopefully takes bitcoin higher will be by Bakkt, which will go live late January 2019. Bakkt’s one-day bitcoin futures settlement for cash for a bitcoin. It’s not a derivative.
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:11:55
Institutions are going to really start buying. Get in now!!! FOMO in mid to late 2019. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:30:01
I just bought 1 btc today too. It’s nice to have one that can potentially be worth 6 figures in 5 years time or less.
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:31:24

Rekt my ass. I always make money in the stock market, rain or shine, that is, my cash income grows month after month, and year after year. I can’t say the same for you. You are probably a wage earner at McDonalds sweeping floors, cleaning bathrooms, or flipping burgers. You’re the fool!!! Go get rekt. I’m laughing to the fiat bank and hopefully bitcoin too. ��

It’s not going to work for bitcoin. It’s going to zero 
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:09:46
Go buy yourself a nicer place to live then buying a  damn freaking car. You crypto idiot!
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:51:03
 I’m also in the same boat as you. Good luck!���� 
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:38:55
Yes and the government shutdown lol
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:04:38
That’s when we should buy more
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:50:26
Is this even credible? I doubt it
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:19:51
Next we will hear bitcoin will never fall below $3ks... then it happens lol
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:24:09
Where’s the decency police on Reddit?!
@_date: 2019-01-23 03:52:43
I’ve been silenced by Reddit fuckers
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:48:33
Why even send a dime to this or any other crypto guru? Just buy direct and hold duh
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:09:05
Stop this comparison. Ltc is crap or founder said a shitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:51:41
No ETF, bitcoin settlement futures , no real custody solutions from a major financial institution yet. However, we will have one soon from the likes of Fidelity, NASDAQ and Bakkt.
@_date: 2019-01-12 03:12:13
You are a freaking dummy. You deserve it. No one fool you. Your greed obviously fooled you. Now you can sell and get whatever you can get out of it and move on with your life. Or if you like, you can also hold in the hopes that in 5 to 10 years time it’ll be far more in value. Take your poison. Be a man �� 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:43:07
It’s a scam lol you’ve been conned 
@_date: 2019-01-31 01:16:57
I think it’s heading lower but my guts tells me it won’t . Gut or head, take your pick lol
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:37:18
It’s not happening this year. Keep on trying and keep the dream alive. Maybe we may get one in 2050. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:56:54
Lol Bakkt will go live sometime this year. Do you think they would waste their hundreds of millions of dollars and make a fool of themselves? Plzzzz 
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:26:47
You Lowlife 
@_date: 2019-01-29 13:49:42
It’s bull shit imo all this talk about institutions buying otc is to get retail fired up. Not working haha 
@_date: 2019-01-07 02:56:51
Absolutely will quadruple my current holdings if it falls to $1000.
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:18:32
Through the passage of time and the halving of bitcoins, the price will naturally go higher unless interest wanes to a point that it’ll have no effect. I’m betting that would not be the case. Bitcoin will be substantially higher in due time. It’s a great time to buy more if you haven’t. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:57:50
Futures market bets on prices and mostly settles in cash as opposed to the actual commodity. Bakkt will change that for bitcoins as it will settle in bitcoins, not cash
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:47:20
Yeahhhhhh rightttt lol I doubt it
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:19:09
Ballers lol
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:02:01
He’s spot on. Question is are we near a bottom or nowhere near. Time will definitely tell. Hopefully by 2022 it’s six figures worth each. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:44:59
$50 to $2000 in value won’t make you rich. If you want to be a little bit rich, you should buy at least 5 bitcoins at today’s prices. There’s no guarantee it will ever make you rich. Invest what you can afford to lose completely.
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:38:39
Crystal baller. I think it may go up down sideways crash ... take your pick

Nope it’s dead for the 100th time
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:46:29
Get out of altcoins buy btc now and hold long term 
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:08:17
Not true. Just today CNBC’s Brian Kelly said probably the SEC will extend the ETF review period to give it more thought. They don’t want to be blame if retail investors gets burn by bitcoins later on. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:47:02
On the verge of a meltdown all the way to $500 per bitcoin because the world’s central banks will call for an all out ban on all things cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:18:32
Binance no way! Try Gemini in addition to Coinbase. Both are US based companies.
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:52:26
That’s why one bitcoin could be worth $200,000 or more. Some say as high as $1 million per coin!
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:28:11
You will care when it goes another 70% lower. If you say you don’t really care you’re just bullshitting yourself. I care!
@_date: 2018-07-30 21:55:06
Not enough of them are into it still. Hence, bitcoin has much more room for growth.
@_date: 2018-07-02 23:58:55
Oh please, be real. I’m peanuts with 10 Bitcoins. Target the WinkervossTwins! Not me 
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:31:20
Even if I’m in the green by 25% or more, I’m not selling. I’m into it long term.
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:54:19
Help help ... I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!!! $hitcoins 
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:16:52
How many bitcoins you’ll take for selling?
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:34:39
Bitcoin to 10k by the end of August. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:38:06
Bitcoin to zero lol

Smart man. I have more conviction than him, I’m at 2% of my net worth in bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:55:47
I’m out of litecoin and bitcoin cash. Staying on with the real bitcoin and ethereum. No more

@_date: 2018-07-27 03:56:40
Bought some more earlier today after the selloff. Now I’m at full size. Let it ride for years on out.
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:27:28
Don’t know but if it goes to the $5s, I’m definitely buying more again.
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:56:40
Does this guy have a website?
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:24:02
Guessing game at best.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:08:03
It may fall again and test new lows. When it happens, make sure you’ve got the balls to buy more!
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:47:02
Tell that to the billions of people around the world who do not have bank accounts, the so-called unbanked. He’s just an elite with an elitist view.

Listen up, how I turned $500 into 20 BTC in 6 months! That’s even better!

Spike higher earlier and next thing you know it took a huge dump down. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:40:53
Obviously you have never invested in your life. A trader will always be mediocre. Good luck day trading.
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:08:27
Just buy the real thing. Buy bitcoin or btc. Everything else is a shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:07:11
He was wrong early this year saying btc to $27k. If you had listened to him, you are now deep in the red in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:13:52
Full of horse manure 
@_date: 2018-07-15 21:35:39
Little people wouldn’t but institutions or large investors may.
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:12:35
Haha just buy and hold long term. If you are short term trader good for you. I’m not wasting my time making money that way. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:00:50
This Roger Ver guy is a desperate bitcoin cash pusher. When you see someone pushing so hard to get you to buy his coin, stay away! A scam
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:38:33
At least 20 bitcoins. I can do with 10, however 20 will turn into 1 cool million US dollars if bitcoin closes the year-end at $50,000 each. Dream dream dream... let me dream!
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:13:50
Doom and gloom guy. I’m tired of these guys selling fear. Life goes on for the better otherwise we will have a revolution in this country. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:03:11
I think so. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:19:45
That’s India. Always backwards. Korea, Japan and China are cool with cryptos.
@_date: 2018-07-25 23:59:19
Most probably ain’t happening.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:03:57
Why sell the future for the past? Just for a few dollars. Think longer term.
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:29:56
Brian Kelly on CNBC is doubtful of a bitcoin ETF this year. He said it repeatedly to host Melissa Lee. Hope he’s wrong.
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:22:20
When did he say this again? Or are you refreshing old news?
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:44:24
Dumb ass Nigerian scammers.
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:15:53
It’s institutional money chasing bitcoin in the spot market = $10k minimum  
@_date: 2018-07-17 13:15:27
Tell that to venture capitalist Tim Draper. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 23:06:54
Well I’ve got 10!
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:31:46

So you can buy a car? Get real people. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:20:36
Yes I have and my bitcoin position is down by only 1.5% as of today. I started buying early this year and only recently when bitcoin was in the 6k range I added aggressively, tripling my position. Hopefully I did the right thing! Time will tell.
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:02:41
Lose your door key, call the locksmith. Lose your ATM debit card, call bank for a replacement card. Lose your bitcoin private key, call Jesus!

Young people are working to help the unbanked of the world. What is he doing?
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:33:27
Because they can scam you and run away with their ill gotten gains.
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:21:11
Is this a credible report?
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:27:00
Too bad. My advice, get out of India. Too much government control there as well as in China.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:52:54
Yeah smart response. It’s going higher folks. Only fools would think it goes to $0.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:28:12
Investors wants ETFs because they believe it would usher in fresh capital into the crypto space driving prices higher. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:15:35
Yeah dollar cost averaging does work if you have the capital and patience to do it. However, what you dollar average into better be a viable asset with one or more catalyst for an eventual recovery. With that said, yes indeed, dollar cost averaging does work in the long run because a stock/commodity goes through ups and down cycles. Hopefully you’ll catch the next big wave to recover unrealized losses into a winning trade. Ummmm taste so good lol
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:26:50
Wrong, it’s going to zero lol
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:40:16
That’s the thing. I’m a piker. They better off going after the likes of Peter Thiel or Tim Draper. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:59:52
It’s in the news
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:41:46
Flushing out the weak hands into the mid to low 5s. I’m buying more at low 5s.
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:58:58
How about 0.0000006 of a bitcoin as of today’s price? Lol
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:16:55
The current rally in bitcoin is caused by wealthy Chinese loading up bitcoins in exchange for fiat Yuan, in anticipation of the yuan devaluation due to US China trade tensions.
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:34:27
Bitcoin $8000 looks very likely over the next 24 hours of trading. Many Traders and investors are front-running the upcoming VanEck Bitcoin ETF approval from the SEC, by the end of next month. If approved, bitcoin could easily surpass $10k by September.
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:12:29
Back to 8100 or lower. Futures expiration by months end may cause it to go back to the 7 handle.
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:29:12
No, December lol
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:15:32
The millennials will soon realize bitcoin is cool and will make them a fortune.
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:46:46
Ride it all the way up to $200,000, through many ups and downs, but it will be there in a few years. Don’t get shaken out along the way. It’s going to be a roller-coaster ride to the moon eventually. Better yet guys, I’ll see you all at $500,000 ;-)
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:58:43
We need serious adoption before this target is ever hit. Crypto gift and debit cards are the way for mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:03:41
Come on let’s take it down back to the 5s ;-))
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:17:24
$200,000 I’ll buy that, but at $100 million, I call that bull crap!
@_date: 2018-07-13 22:15:43
There’s still a lot more blood to spill.... 5s..... 4s.... 3s.... 
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:56:01
It was rejected long time ago. CNBC is full of malarkey. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:38:11
All I can say is buy some, set aside some investment capital to this new asset class. It’s digital gold.
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:17:44
I wouldn’t trade my btc for a car. Btc will be worth far more in 5 years than this car. It’s certain the car will be worthless in few years time, bitcoin ? Probably much higher than today’s price. Dumb idea.

Show me at least a Tesla Model S P100D. Ok.
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:15:00
I don’t know where BK get his info but from what I read from an article earlier today, sources from within the SEC and the CFTC claims that the VanEck SolidX Cboe bitcoin ETF is certain to be approved.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:28:35
Yeah it’s only a matter of time 
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:28:11
It’s Fugazy, impossible

At least he has an open mind about it and invested a small percentage of it in his family’s portfolio, unlike Warren Buffett and his boy Charlie Munger who are never coiners and bashers.
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:30:55
I accept bitcoins too. Text me and I’ll send you my public key. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:28:01
That’s why we need bitcoin. It’s peoples money, freedom money. Now go out and get more. Get out of fiat gradually.
@_date: 2018-11-01 23:18:19
Fake bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:24:08
Yeah bitcoin really doesn’t need an ETF. We can do without one, really.
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:19:09
Because nobody works for free. Duh socialist u
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:09:17
Eventually he will be proven right. The question is not if, but when. I see bitcoins worth as much as $200,000 each by 2022. Buy today and lock away!
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:04:36
Everything else is concoin 
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:14:37
Yes spread the FUD
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:37:07
Ask your employer to pay you in bitcoins. Problem solved.
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:46:46
The price has already risen from a mere $100 years back. Question is, will we ever see $20k again? The bulls say yes, in fact we will see $500,000 by 2024. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:42:27
Ok ok. Thanks for your concern. Seriously, thank you. Peace
@_date: 2018-07-23 04:30:24
Financial paper assets. It’s in there ok. You just got to believe it since it’s highly regulated and audited. If it turns out to be fake then it’s fraud, criminal. 
Why do you have to go so far to say the ETF sponsor VanEck and the Cboe Exchange will rip off investors? These organizations are not some no name penny stock boiler rooms. Stop being so paranoid. You make too many idiotic statements.
@_date: 2018-07-21 13:22:46
It is certain to be approved, but at the same time the SEC will come down with new regulations on ICOs. It may negatively impact the price of Ethereum, but not bitcoins. I would front-run by buying bitcoins over all other crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:07:13
Lol idiot bagholder until 5800. Now looking at 7400 thinking what the F did I do?! Soon 10k, year end 20k. Enough said

Coinbase vault system is quite annoying. After you initiate a transfer out of it, they send numerous emails hoping you cancel the transaction. It seems as if they don’t want you to sell. Kind of like running a boiler room operation if you ask me! lol
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:25:48
Just as retail got smoked from the parabolic moves of late last year, Institutions are now really coming in. It’s time to buy even more bitcoins. Follow the smart money, not the dumb money!
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:18:58
Why should I convince you to buy bitcoins? Waste of my time. Now go away you bum!
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:40:59
They gonna say sorry folks we can’t approve it because it’s too volatile. Come back next year when it’s less volatile lol
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:57:15
My neighbors who are daytraders in stocks, dissed bitcoins and the likes as scams, fraud, bitcon to zero etc. One day, soon, they will all realize that they were completely wrong. Duh!

How you know that’s gay unless you are actually one. Good luck
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:53:09
Question is will most people buy some? That’s all we need is a majority of investors buying some. If that occurs, moonshot is certain.
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:54:18
This time it may prove to be real. You just never really know. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:18:53
They are true believers. Holding on for dear life.
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:37:21
What’s the point of having these things?
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:18:05
Probably bought it used from Carmax for 9k lol
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:45:16
If you bought in the $6ks you are looking smart right now. Who knows this latest rally may just be another dead cat bounce. Time will tell if it can get pass $10k and stay above that into year end.
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:41:25
Now you are talking street thugs. No way they have the brains to hack or track down someone on the Internet. Lol
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:54:13
Trade short term for more losses overtime more like it. That’s the reality! Right 
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:47:02
You are looking at the future where every business around the world will accept bitcoins in favor of Visa or MasterCard.
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:16:53
Maybe you took the deposit money that wasn’t yours and spent it all? If that’s the case, you owe the bank.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:31:11
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:08:10
Are you blind? It’s $10M. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:30:31
Nice hit. We are sure to surpass 8k shortly.
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:38:57
How to ‘invest’ in bitcoin safely is a better title.
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:14:02
Yahhhh 
@_date: 2018-07-20 23:54:40
Probably end of August 
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:33:05
Zero interest folks . It’s going to zero
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:21:00
Pikers house. Only $1.75M? 
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:35:15
Right the ETF will directly buy and hold bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:10:30
He’s a gold bug. Buy gold my a$$. Bitcoins yes but don’t put all your fiat into it though because you’ll still need fiat for your livelihood. Be real people. Let’s not get carried away with all this doom and gloom bull. Life goes on with fiat!
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:53:13
That car ain’t $100k, probably $50k lol
@_date: 2018-07-20 19:10:49
If he’s so sure about a huge rally right after a large drawdown to the 5s, which may never happen, why not just buy now and add more on the way down?! Dollar-cost average. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:00:30
Nice language 
@_date: 2018-07-12 01:54:22
F this and F that. Yeah I get your point. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:51:53
Wtf are u trying to say
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:36:49
If it ever reaches $1million per bitcoin, I’ll be considered very wealthy by many in US standard.
@_date: 2018-07-01 15:29:56
6000 and up we go! Buy Litecoin for a bigger bang!
@_date: 2018-07-13 17:03:36
Well we shall see when the global markets crashes bitcoin may rise to offset the losses.
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:30:16
No, it’s investing in a unique uncorrelated asset class. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 23:54:20
Get a job lol
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:52:57
Yeah right. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 01:45:29
Yeah what an idiot
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:07:21
Yeah yeah yeah. If they believe so strongly about that, now is the time to exchange all of their dollars for bitcoins. Haha gotcha! I don’t think so.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:55:23
He had inside information. I don’t care for his lemoncoin anymore. I’m only in bitcoin and ethereum.
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:49:40
You probably wrote bad checks or ACH into negative territory. I don’t believe banks closed account of those who merely trade or buy bitcoins through known crypto exchanges. I use Bank of America and had zero problems with them while buying bitcoins through Coinbase or Gemini. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:48:16
First of all why are we so worked up over this etf thing. If people truly want to own bitcoins, it’s easy to buy and hold. Just open a Coinbase or Gemini account and buy from there. Duh!!!
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:29:56
It’s going to fall to zero 
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:04:22
Go to hell you low life poor bum
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:59:18
This is why the financial services industry is so bias against bitcoins! That includes you Mr. Buffett!!!
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:02:23
Bs news it’s all sensationalism. Getting views and clicks . Don’t believe them. Anyone sells into this news is a complete idiot.
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:58:19
I hear ya. Peace
@_date: 2018-07-16 23:00:14
Yeah I’ll buy 25% more at that price.
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:20:10
Yeah like they going to steal your bitcoins when they already have far more than most people will ever have. Give me a break!
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:49:06
Year end 10k minimum
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:50:39
Lol stop already. I’m tired of all this short term trading nonsense. Just buy and hold for the moonshot. See y’all in 2024. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:23:16
You all are NOT getting a bitcoin ETF this year. Just forget it. In 2026, bitcoin will be $400,000 each. Just buy hold and tune out all the daily market noise.
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:44:53
Funny Howard Marks dissing bitcoin causes it to begin to lose value over the last hour or so. He calls bitcoin a trade, finding someone to pay you at a higher price, a greater fool theory, nothing more. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:05:16
Uh? He’s dead wrong!
@_date: 2018-07-17 02:14:47
Because it’s going to be $200,000 per btc by 2022. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:57:26
It’s going to rally again from the low 6k.
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:55:23
Fake news y’all 
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:04:09
Lol these atm machines are like pawn shops 
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:03:00
Hope the ETF gets approved and start trading by year end instead of 1st quarter 2019.
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:29:31
Either I make money or I lose money. We will find out soon.
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:52:03
Very soon, FOMO will come right back into cryptos propelling bitcoin into the $10ks.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:00:07
They are definitely shitting in their pants, literally lol
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:22:10
They won’t do it. Just a scare tactic. If they do, the Fed will embark on a new round of quantitative easing to absorb the Chinese dumping of our Treasuries.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:24:07
Just sour grapes hoping to buy at 3000s
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:28:16
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:15:56
Remember there’s a finite number of btc and there are millions of US millionaires and also all over the globe. 250,000 is not hard to
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:05:07
Moon by 2022 $250000
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:47:41
Yup 8100
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:08:45
Stop answering me then lol
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:14:13
You lack imagination... I think $250000 is quite possible
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:16:18
Sucker them in followed by a huge dump lol
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:39:55
This time it’s not retail money but institutional money flowing into bitcoin. Don’t sell!!! HODL!!!
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:35:21
The global 1 to 5% don’t understand the 95% out there who are usually unbanked, with no bank account and no credit/debit cards. These are the people who are likely to use bitcoin or crypto. Y’all see the potential now?
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:58:56
Retard money you
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:59:35
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:14:07
Depends on what you are waiting for. Buy a shitcoin and you’ll wait to the day you are six feet under.
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:44:20
8200 more like it
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:58:36
Yes because it may have less of an effect this time around. As you should know, nothing is certain ok! I still own a fair amount of bitcoins, more than an average Joe or Jane that’s for sure. I’ll make many US$ millions, if Tim Draper’s $250000 price target prediction comes through in 2023 or whenever. That’s enough to make me one of the happiest man on earth. Now go buy and HODL according to YOUR situation. Peace ✌️
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:19:45
Nope just a cover up for his crypto exchange mess up
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:08:37
The way it’s going, it’ll take out the all-time high this year!  $25000 year end price target
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:53:40
Nobody knows for sure $8k was the top. It could have easily been $9k. Just buy and sock away for long term.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:32:43
Yeah 10% off is a good buy . Bought 1 today near the lows. Buy and hold
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:41:11
It’s going to 5700 soon. We may see it rise to as high as 9000s then a big reversal of at least 30%. You’ve been warned!
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:54:42
Yeah fishy but who cares cause I’m gonna dump on you when it hits $250000
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:53:13
What an idiot
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:17:34
Stupid is stupid does lol
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:51:54
9500 more like it
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:17:26
His crypto exchange is doom
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:29:12
Fake volume?
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:45:34
Yeah ain’t going to happen in my opinion. It’s likely going higher and higher over time . So get in now folks!!! FOMO fever
@_date: 2019-05-06 23:45:20
Only 11500... I was thinking $14000
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:33:54
If he was in fact Satoshi, he would have already crashed bitcoin price. The fact he didn’t proofs he’s not Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:48:30
Yeah who cares if I pay 20000 when I can sell at 250000. Remember December 2017? Lol
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:50:04
Don’t mean shit to me now that I’ve sold most of my bitcoins weeks ago. I still own a fair amount of bitcoin. Up down sideways whatever. I’m holding long term with what I have remaining.
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:38:29
Not just yet. Testing of the Bakkt platform to begin in the month of July.
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:14:37
What a waste of time with these guys. You may even lose your bitcoins when they get hacked
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:49:16
Looks like something out of an Indiana Jones movie. Lol
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:27:19
Ok. Using Elon’s name
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:12:23
Ok ok 80%?
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:25:55
Leave it at the exchange
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:11:04
Yes it’s capital gain/loss depending on your cost basis.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:20:27
You betcha ... it will take ten years to play out ... only for a select few who can hold through thick and thin.
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:12:05
A crypto guy who didn’t understand that btc is immutable in the first place. Questionable figure
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:06:41
Believe me a lot more than an average person will ever buy.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:20:01
We will hit $7,000 this evening!
@_date: 2019-05-29 18:26:45
Your woman shouldn’t leave you for money you’ve lost. If she does, tell her to get the hell out and never return.
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:18:28
Haha yeah a million each ! Bank on that !!!!
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:25:11
Look I own bitcoins and I’m starting to think it’s a ponzi. Who cares when I can ride up in this scam to $250000. Yeah money!!!
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:39:38
8000 price and is mostly retail money. Think when the big institutions comes in, we will take out the all time high 20000 in no time. 65000 pt by 2021, 250,000 by 2023.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:20:01
This lady is full of shit. Billionaires aren’t buying bitcoins. It’s mom and pop buying and hoping to rip off Uncle Warren lol ain’t happening
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:20:49
That is if most millionaire wants to own it. I can tell you not everyone is a believer. So hopefully just a small fraction of them is more than enough to propel btc to 250000.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:21:41
Now that’s horseshit good luck with that
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:04:14
Last weeks 60 minutes show may have given it a boost
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:30:07
And why is it under 9000 still lol
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:51:57
The hack really got to him.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:33:15
More fiat onboard to crypto is good .
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:21:42
Trade wars now escalating to Mexico. This president of ours may soon cause a stock market crash if he continues playing the tariff hard stick game. I’m starting to wonder that’s why his casinos in Atlantic City NJ went bust, bankrupted, not once but twice! All this could mean bitcoin going to $25000 year end. Good
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:50:57
Sounds like a Chinaman wrote this lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:10:43
You’ll wake up and it’s down to 7000s lol
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:44:17
Really so why is it still at under 8k... tick tock tick tick $5700...
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:20:29
My prediction, bitcoin to $250,000 by 2022. Anybody can do that 
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:26:23
And also the miners selling to pay their operating expenses
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:12:10
They are down so big that they are still in denial 
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:00:44
It’s going up slowly ... slow is healthy
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:28:27
It’s heading to 20000 into 2020...
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:56:54
Horrible music and voice
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:19:00
It’s quite possible, but I’m thinking $14000 by then.
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:56:10
He could have made some serious money with that money in rat poison Square.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:03:50
I own everything, a little of everything. Diversification baby!
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:58:08
Most of the components are made outside of the US. The Chinese will hurt themselves more if they do it. Too risky so they won’t do it.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:10:32
Gambling device ��
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:16:37
Coordinated buying by the big boys. It’s clearly manipulated in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:24:02
Yeah ok you gypsy king. I see 65000 late 2020
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:17:56
12000 year end 2019
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:52:37
Someone’s going to take a big dump
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:50:10
Traders are mostly losers
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:12:44
I added on the way down to 3000s and held on. Now looking like a smarty pants. See, I told you so!!! �� not going to zero
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:27:10
You should rename yourself “Centurion Blackcard”. Platinum is for pikers lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:48:04
Yes 25000 easily
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:36:28
Yes it will be postponed once again and as a result, bitcoin will fall below 3000s into the low 2 handle in the first quarter of 2019.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:01:03
Now that’s the dumbest thing you can do. You remind me of that dude who sold all his belongings just to buy bitcoin and have his family live in a trailer. Sad life if things don’t pan out! Very financially irresponsible. Not smart!
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:49:07
You with 3 extra dicks, not in a gazillion years . Btc to 250000 very possible . Not you though, not even for dicks. Oh by the way you being a porno actor is very easy. Anyone can these days. It’s as easy as film your ass with your iPhone  and post on pornhub. But sorry you’ll never be a billionaire cause you have no money to bet or not enough to win big. Loser
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:54:21
Talk is cheap
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:18:36
Let’s bash it to 1000 so we can stock up on more cheap coins to unload at the highs.
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:15:31
The next drop will probably be higher than your cost lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:57:06
7500 was the near term support area. Once it touched that line it bounce right back above 8k only to fall below that line for a day or two. We are now in consolation stage within 7800 to 8100 range. Once we can close above 8300 for a day, 9000 is next on the �� and we should hit it by this weekend.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:35:21
250000 lol
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:37:56
Never say never. I am sure it will surpass the all-time high, and by 2023, $250,000 per bitcoin. That’s my price target. I will continue buying 1 every month, store, and then spend my btc in 2023. Get in now y’all 
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:21:58
Bch is shitcoin .. go with the king of crypto, bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:33:41
No no no we’re going to $25000 in a straight line up
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:07:32
Yes buy on credit, sell your home, car, everything, take out loans of all types, and go all in!!!! $8k bitcoin is damn cheap!!!! Now that’s true conviction!!!
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:32:18
When it goes down 80% will you still be here? Lol
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:41:15
These are traders hoping to buy back cheaper and recycle
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:59:30
Yeah they are definitely shaking ! Long bitcoins, drop the gold!!!
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:50:41
Buy 8000 or lower lol
@_date: 2019-05-23 01:22:47
So what! ur not African lol
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:31:00
It’s becoming a clear scam. Nothing I can do but hope one day I’ll get back all my capital and keep the extras for future upside, if any.

@_date: 2019-05-28 21:02:47
They won’t know how to transact in btc. Stupid post lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:02:44
I’m buying more if it hits 7500 or lower
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:41:41
Key takeaways: “Bitcoin is much easier to transport. It is much easier to divide. It is tough to break a bar gold into its component pieces. Bitcoin has all these essential qualities that I think are superior to gold.”
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:20:30
Gold is the real tangible thing. A proven save haven since the time of Jesus Christ or God’s money �� not some string of numbers on a digitized global ledger!
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:04:56
Proof it!!! Do it �� 
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:34:08
I’m sitting tight. Not selling. Think long term!
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:23:50
$2B AUM is peanuts. That proofs the institutional money coming in is mostly bull shit news to lure mom and pop into bitcoin.

Don’t mean a thing really. It’s bogus wealth
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:57:56
7000 now ... 8000 soon lol 6000 possible
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:28:45
Heard this one before . A nothing burger 
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:36:14
Buy a little down here and add every time it’s down ten percent
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:10:55
Crystallballer good luck �� 
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:01:34
Bitcoin may one day be a million each . It can also probably be worth $100 each, if it’s not widely adopted. Take your pick
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:20:56
Don’t worry we said this when it was at 7800. Then we took that out to 8900... soon 9800 and we continue to climb up slowly to $25000 by end of year. Lol
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:49:49
If not I’m guessing they are eating 10 cents ramens.
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:47:36
I’m talking year end $25000... $250000 in 2 to 3 years time. I’ll sell at $250000.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:50:55
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:23:51
Very early on during the beginning stages of crypto winter, I realized diversification in this space doesn’t work. When btc sells off, the alt or shitcoins sells off even harder. After a while, I decided to sell all my ltc bch eth for more btc. I’m so glad I did that when looking back. Now just continue to hold for the long term, that is 3 to 5 years time horizon.
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:39:17
It’s going to consolidate here in the 7/8 range then takeout 10k after. It’s a bullish setup.
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:15:54
14000 btc soon
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:38:05
Going back to 6000 lol
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:34:09
I’ll laugh myself to the bank in 3 to 5 years time. Let’s see who comes out on top again! ��
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:02:35
Ok smarty pants lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:07:57
Will he say the same shit when it goes to $14k?! Lol
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:34:17
You need to bet at least $50000 USD
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:28:48
8000 is not the peak when we can see $55000 next year.
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:23:59
It can go up or down just like with every asset class
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:48:46
Yup probably right... $10k will come soon
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:57:54
Bad sign .. that means we’re heading to 2000s
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:12:31
I don’t know about you guys, but I’m starting to hate all those people who keep on saying and believing that bitcoin will go to zero eventually. Question: why is Fidelity, and the parent company of the NYSE, still working on building the infrastructure needed for the trading, storing and spending of this new asset class? For the fun of it?!
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:04:46
Spreading fud? Weeks, no freaking way
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:25:48
It’s likely much more, think 10,000 to 14,000 USD$.
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:39:38
Get out while it’s still good 
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:00:37
Give it 250000
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:35:41
One word, it’s ‘global’. It will be Bakkt ;-)
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:32:31
When it crashes again it will be Fuck you bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:44:51
Oh please stop begging for higher prices from the whales. You should know, the whales could easily take it down and give you a good beating! They don’t give a shit about you chicken littles.
@_date: 2019-05-23 02:56:14
Yes but first we go to 1000. Then to the moon lol
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:27:07
Will it be as effective this time?
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:10:57
My 2022 prediction, $75,000 per btc
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:23:48
I’ll sell all my whole bitcoins for $250000 US dollars each, no more no less. Text me if you like to buy, no haggling ��
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:24:27
Um ... sounds like someone couldn’t get laid or never did. ��
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:49:47
What’s stopping you from telling your loved ones how many bitcoin you own and sharing the passwords or keys with them? I told my kids and wife how many I own, and wrote down step-by-step instructions stored in a safe on how to retrieve in the even I’m no longer around.
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:00:00
Buy back higher. That’s how you make big money. Buy high and then sell low lol keep doing it till you hit 0.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:47:48
Yes of course you have to pay taxes on realized gains.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:45:49
9000s and over... ready.., set... go!!!
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:19:35
Yes it’s your right ... let me do it again... $250000 by 2023. :-)
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:50:05
Yeah probably coordinated buying across most exchanges to boost the price higher followed by a dump a few days or weeks after. Then they do it again and again to $250000.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:24:43
At 250000 I will spend my btc
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:14:02
Just 1 million new buyers will take it easily to 14000 imo. Let’s go!!!
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:11:31
Conspiracy theorists are at work with cryptos, the Alex Jones of cryptos. �� 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:55:45
Nonsense. The US Dollar is King! Bitcoin is... well you guessed it, gold 2.0? Hehe
@_date: 2018-12-22 04:25:10
10000 or 1000 take your pick
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:49:50
And what does that mean for the spot market prices? $1000 lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:59:08
The difference now is big money is involved as opposed to 2017 bull run caused by mostly retail investors.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:53:07

Yes very smart man $0.00

@_date: 2018-12-31 19:13:52
Wtf r u talking about 
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:24:01
I’ll still hear from my former neighbor it’s going to zero eventually
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:54:41
It’ll bounce back and go higher from here... higher lows higher highs
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:21:44
Duh 
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:37:36
Push it out to year 3000. Lol
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:04:15
It’s back and we will not see $3000 ever again in our lifetime. Now the new base probably $30000 in the next boom and bust cycle.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:20:57
You’re not far from making back and more . Stay in but let me dump on y’all at $250000. Lol
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:12:26
Ok let’s just say $1 million US
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:05:24
Yes safer than at an FDIC insured bank ��
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:22:05
It was 9000 for like a few minutes. It’s like I’m cummming and then she stops... damn lady what happen!?
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:30:25
Now why would you do that when the price of a bitcoin maybe $55,000 after May 2020? Another pizza moment in bitcoin history in the making!
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:57:37
Somesay by 2022, $250,000!!! Lol
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:07:30
It’s going to break the all-time high eventually. Buy, accumulate and hold
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:57:05
Well if you are young and that 23.2% is based on just a few grand, that’s ok, but when you are managing a portfolio in the US$ millions like I am, you shouldn’t do that. With that being said, a 2 to 5% allocation to bitcoin in a traditional investment portfolio is a prudent thing to do in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:03:26
It’s a good bet now to buy a bitcoin. Attractive risk/reward, asymmetrical trade
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:34:43
It goes against the Chinese idea of full control of its currency. It will never happen
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:57:11
$5 dollars? What a waste of time. Maybe $500!
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:07:01
You’re the piker lol
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:17:21
You gonna lose. If you had said in 3 years time, you’ll probably win.
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:36:03
That’s what everybody thinks will happen. It’s common knowledge and that’s where the problem lies. I would be careful here. We may get back to the 3000s.
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:09:14
2020 the price will be $200./
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:17:58
Run on the crypto exchange at Binance!!!! Run fire ��
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:34:50
I can feel it... 9000 yah!!!
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:45:23
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:11:41
Smart move! Lambo time 
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:38:42
Nope, fiat buys you groceries and help pay your rent to live on. I’m sorry, however, bitcoins fails to do that at the present form. It’s just the facts. By the way, I have about 3% of my net worth in bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:54:16
$300 is the true bottom
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:53:13
Just when you about to come you pull out to keep it loaded ;-)

@_date: 2018-12-14 21:53:32
I will never sell mine at these prices. I rather let it go to zero.

You’ll get shaken out

Trillions in fiat, money created perpetually out of thin air.
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:23:29
It’s going to break to $2k, and fall to the $1000 in 2019
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:38:16
Still bullish ! Good for them
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:17:26
What’s this got to do with bitcoin or crypto? Idiot trailer trash lowlife ��
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:17:01
Gone means we pass 20k and then it’s supercharged fomo to 250000
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:34:31
I like to buy a few at 5000.

Suck it up or try to make back in other ways.

Warrens advice for bitcoin is rat poison Square
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:53:34
There will be no significant dip or correction, the move is higher highs , higher lows .... we are heading to $20000 from here
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:04:50
He’s full of shit.
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:28:35
Everything. Just excuses .. the problem with bitcoins now is that most are not interested in buying an asset that loses value daily, monthly and possibly into many years. It’s basically a non-cash producing asset. It’s not even a store of value anymore, or Gold 2.0! What it is now is fools gold. When the next major bull rally comes, cash out!!!
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:40:22
This is child abuse .  You’re dummy
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:32:39
Sounds like a Ponzi scheme to some people
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:50:34
What’s moon? $250,000 anyone!??? I’ve got quite a few at that price if you like. Anyone? And I’ll give up the $1mm bitcoin prize for $250k ��
@_date: 2019-05-18 12:48:03
Probably a Binance inside hack job
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:24:42
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:41:53
Its fair value $65000. Still damn cheap
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:27:24
Yeah at about 7800 sold 75% of my position. I still own a fair amount of bitcoin going forward.
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:12:05
Just think when it’s at 250000
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:15:45
Yeah I’ll sell you my bitcoins all the way to $500. Keep buying to $0.00
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:48:40
Only a fool would do that. Buy what you can afford, don’t over expose no matter how great you think it is.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:27:35
Yeah and I’ll buy more n more plzzz
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:56:58
Man if I had the crystal ball I’ll buy even more!!!
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:53:52
There are just too many upcoming positive catalyst to propel bitcoin to 10000 and more . Got to be a dumb ass to be going short here.
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:51:18
You’ve been had
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:48:11
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:18:02
Big institutional investors are not going to store their private keys in a safe or safe deposit box or somewhere in the woods. They store at large custodians like Northern Trust or BNY Mellon. Only little people think like that.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:42:30
Going to the dumps ... hope not lol
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:27:28
It’s falling now  to 6800... never say never again lol
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:01:02
$15 is the ultimate basement floor price for bitcoin. Give and take, the cost of a large sized box of pizza. Confirmed lol
@_date: 2019-05-06 21:36:43
31% per month is plain insane
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:17:31
Cryptos are gambling device.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:58:11
My ass I’m getting rekt. I’m looting y’all lol
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:10:54
He sure doesn’t look Japanese ��
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:08:27
So all this talk by Tom Lee that the average fully-loaded cost to mine a bitcoin is somewhere about $7000 is full of crap. It can be $700 along with the fall of bitcoin prices. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:12:24
I’ve got a feeling that all this talk about institutional interest is bogus. If there’s any institutional interest, it’s probably from small no name investors with piker portfolios.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:02:58
It’s therefore undervalued in the spot markets. Buy long bitcoins today
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:14:35
Traditional Wall Street investors and funds aren’t buying. It’s no name startup institutional investors who are buying. So it’s kind of misleading if you ask me! Anyway, whatever it takes to $250000 �� I’ll dump all on y’all at that price. See you all in Disneyland ��
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:09:45
Then $1000, then $100. Goodbye
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:39:38
Three years later you’ll get kick out of the house and she’ll divorce you lol
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:55:22
Atta boy pay more than market! Now that’s a recipe for success yessss!!!
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:18:25
Yeah with 100x leverage at BitMex.
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:50:29
Bring ‘em on. I’m loading in oil stocks and btc!
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:52:44
8600 now. I’m now convinced crypto winter is over. Time to add on dips
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:26:36
Don’t buy through them but store with them. I’ll buy at cash app then transfer over.
@_date: 2019-05-05 14:07:24
It’s going to zero lol it’s a gambling device!!!
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:32:49
What is a few weeks? Lol
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:14:50
Dollar bills currently pays for their tacos. So it’s dollar for now
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:15:47
Yeah cold wallet offline and bury your written private key on a piece of paper somewhere in your backyard. Good advice lol
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:35:21
It sure ain’t a currency because currencies do not fall 10% in a day. If anything, it maybe considered a gold substitute and even that is questionable nowadays. I really don’t know what to make of it. It’s just an asset that you hopefully sell to someone else at a higher price than what you paid for hopefully. Call it fools gold for all I care.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:27:46
$55,000 in 18 months time. What is a couple of thousands difference?! Buy!!!
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:58:16
Must be a kid lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:19:21
Someone dump it back down to 8700.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:10:39
He’s crying for a second chance to buy at the bottom of 2018 or early 2019. It’s not going to happen, you loser. It’s too late. Now you’ll have to pay up or miss out forever!!! �� I rest my case.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:55:28
You should just put that $1000 cash under your mattress. You’re not suited for bitcoin as it is a very volatile asset with high risk of failure. If anyone tells you otherwise they are just trying to unload their load on you and cash out. I’m one of them ��
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:27:09
I concur brother
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:00:10
I don’t trust these offshore crypto exchanges. I’ll buy from Coinbase and Gemini. In the future, I’ll buy and store at Fidelity or at E*TRADE.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:20:43
Yeah I’ll dump my stash of bitcoins on her ass at $180000 each
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:00:49
My moonshot is 250000 which seems outrageous at this moment in time. I feel it will happen in 3 short years time. ��
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:36:46
Think 3000s again
@_date: 2019-05-24 12:11:19
250000 very possible in 5 years time. We just have to wait and see. I personally have about 1% of my current net worth in bitcoin. It’s about 2.7% of my current investment portfolio. At one point during crypto winter, I had an 11% allocation but pared back recently during this year’s run up to reduce exposure. No one knows for sure, so it’s prudent to have a sensible percentage according to your risk tolerance. Buy what you can afford to lose completely and HODL.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:41:48
That’s the thing , people are squabbling over a few hundreds/ or even thousands, when bitcoin bulls sees $250,000 by 2023.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:22:27
Yup I agree totally
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:26:32
Depends what you HODL... bitcoins for sure at least that’s how I still feel. 
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:25:28
He should shut close his ahole ��
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:15:11
Click bait

These guys are the pariah of cryptos 
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:21:06
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:05:59
Damn the guy is truly clueless about bitcoin. Useless? Lol old age getting into him
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:30:24
Hope he doesn’t F it up again and again and again  . Sorry ass
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:24:56
There’s an app which allows you to buy anything from Amazon and pay with bitcoin. So yes bitcoins are accepted there too, indirectly
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:10:34
Nice big dump in your pants for sure ��
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:58:17
That’s probably a shitcoin. Good luck 
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:44:31
Reasonable assessment. Strong possibility. Good outlook 
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:46:35
It’s getting dump into year end 2000
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:57:04
$300 is the bottom. Don’t buy yet. It’s going there by 2022.
