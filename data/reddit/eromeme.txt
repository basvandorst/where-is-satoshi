Eh, unless you completely screwed up you should have 4x your bitcoin now even if you still didn't switch back to it, i screwed quite a bit moving through alts and i'm still up 4x, had way more but didn't sell XLM at the top, still holding it, and it could go down to 2000 sats and i'd still be up

But that's exactly what electrum does, when you create a standard wallet it gives you a 12 word seed that will be able to recover your wallet at any point in time. And yes it works on ubuntu thats where i am using it!
Careful about using websites to generate your wallets. They could keep record of your seed and steal your money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:04:49
If you're looking to generate seeds based wallets then use  they could then use that seed on basically any wallet and restore it.
Or you could use a paper wallet  (Go to their github page or save the page from their url and run it in an offline computer)

It looked like a really bad lie to get people to donate for his "honesty" and "kindness". There was no proof, and one of those two was a new account.
Not to mention how to near impossible it is to "mistype an address" as a single invalid character will throw you an error, also if you mistyped a valid address it is near impossible that someone holds the keys for that address.

Ethereum disagrees, as well as many other alts.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:19:07
Yeah you can use the private key from mycelium as well, but you need to scan each private key from each address that had funds on it at the time of the fork.
You should sweep everything and not reuse that hd address but yes, sweeping means the funds on those private keys will be sent to your coinomi wallet, which i believe is currently the hd wallet you restored.
It would be better if it was a new wallet you were sweeping the funds to. Also you need to do that to each currency.

Download the electrum client on linux/ubuntu, create a standard wallet, select import private key and then input the private key and then you'll be able to use the funds.

Do you think technology matters to anyone nowadays? Just on this sub you can see most people got into crypto just to make money, they don't care if it does that or this awesome thing with these awesome features.
What's worse, they made ripple 2nd place when ripple goes against everything that crypto currencies were created for in the first place.
And by the way there are tons of alts with way better technology than bitcoin that are flourishing quite fast, never seen before but they are doing so right now because of the state of bitcoin, and all money is leaving bitcoin and moving towards alts.
As soon as all exchanges start implementing USD/Whatever pairs instead of bitcoin/whatever pairs bitcoin is going down. It does not work, it is 9 years old and it does not work and the fixes are taking way too long and giving a chance for others to take its place.
By the way, ripple is superior although i don't support it because of what i stated before.
-The supply is fixed. There's no inflation. 
-The current transaction cost for a standard transaction is just 0.00001 XRP.
-The transaction cost is not paid to any party: the XRP is irrevocably destroyed.
-Ripple consistently handles 1,500 transactions per second, 24x7, and can scale to handle the same throughput as Visa. 
-Ripple's share is locked in 55 batches, only one batch can be unlocked per month. It would take them 5 years to unlock them all. This makes their incentives 100% aligned with XRP holders. The company is always working on creating new partnerships and expanding XRP's marketshare. 
-Ripple doesn't use proof-of-work anywhere which requires inflation and/or outrageous fees (like Bitcoin)
-Ripple is more decentralized than Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, you have no choice but to trust whoever purchased the most hashing power (currently it's a chinese company called Bitmain). With Ripple, you can run your own validator and setup your own trusted validators list. 10s of non related reputable public and private entities around the world are currently running validators, more keep joining. 
-The software is open-source (Stellar was a fork of Ripple).

Mostly luck. Btc has been crashing all day, when it crashes it brings most alts down with it, once that happens alts instantly go up to the price they were at, then slowly go down again and stay there for a while then slowly go up again.
If you time that properly you can make 10% gains with each sudden crash, i started with 1.5btc and i go all in that's why i have made a lot, but it is really risky and i could lose half out of nowhere at any moment. High risk high reward

I mentioned earlier it took me 4 days to move my money, what if that money was an emergency to pay for a sudden medical bill that came out of nowhere or something that was life saving. It's indeed an issue. Bitcoin has been here for over 8 years now.
I agree on not doing fixes that risks bitcoin getting even more centralized than it already is. But whatever fix it is we need it soon, it's a competition with tons of other solutions that are better.
It also took 4 days and not 2 weeks because i replaced fee in the end.  First fee was 40sats/byte if i recall correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:06
I was going to sell at 20k to try and catch it lower and end up with more bitcoins, i wasn't sure it was going to actually go down again so i didn't do that in the end.

Hey, if you think most people holding bitcoin are not trying to get rich quick too you're wrong. Most people in crypto are trying to get rich-quick, a few really invest in the tech and look long term on it and don't care about loses or gains short term, specially with bitcoin having the issues it has now it is hard to invest on it for the tech, once those issues are solved that may change, there is very promising tech that is already working and proven right now. I was holding a big stack of XLM for a LONG time because i really love the project and what they have done even though the price had barely spiked, i love everything about it and i only decided to move that stack elsewhere because yes, i wanted to get rich, so i'm moving through alts right now. 
Yes alts follow bitcoin prices but that'll probably change very soon when exchanges start to implement new trading pairs and everything stops being directly tied to bitcoin, once that happens bitcoin will have even fewer effect on alts.
And yes lots of alts have perished, but most of them were scams to begin with, those with a solid whitepaper, a solid team behind it and already working products have been a success. 
Look at XLM and what they are doing and what they already have, they also have a few ATMs already around the world. Also look at ICX which is in its infancy right now, also has a promising future. As well as these two there are many more. There are also many more that are vaporware right now like cardano which has a great white paper but has nothing to show yet people speculating have brought the price up hugely.

Search for the download button should take you to their github page, download it, run it on an offline computer then do this:
1. Hit generate
2. Write down the BIP39 Mnemoric seed
3. Scroll down to derivation path, tick  BIP49
3. Scroll down to addresses, there you have your segwit addresses, as well as private and public keys for each one. Just keep the seed and it'll generate all those addresses all the time, write as many addresses as you'd like or only one, and that's it, your paper wallet should be your seed and your addresses, or if you'd like, an address/private key pair.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:39:58
Do you have a file called "wallet.dat"? What can of files do you have there?

They don't have to support a fork if they don't want to. They are not stealing anything, if you wanted your bitcoin gold you should have taken your bitcoins to your own wallet where you own the private keys.

I day trade alts in time of volatily, ripple went from 0.000055 to 0.000095 yesterday and down to 0.000065 today, and it is up to 0.000078 today. And along the way it decreased by 5% and went up again, great opportunity to increase our bitcoin stack if you know what you are doing. When you know the reason alts are pumping and you know it is legit, and you know how to watch patterns on the chart/volume etc it's not that hard to make gains. I'm up quite a bit in bitcoin today thanks to that.
That's what i meant, it is of course almost impossible to day trade bitcoin against fiat, you'll almost always lose. But with alts it is different if you know what you're doing you can gain a lot while bitcoin goes down and alts go up.

It started the revolution sure but now that there are a lot of better tech out there which has tons of more uses it either gets upgraded or left behind, you can believe it won't be replaced no matter what but just look at the past few months versus the past few years on how it has been going against the rest, more and more people will begin to see problems and more and more people will see the advantages of different alts, and as other alts start growing and bitcoin become stagnant people will jump ship, if it is not upgraded it'll die imo, it's a matter of when.
It has nothing unique besides being the first one, and the most accessible one currently as well as the one in front of the news more often, if that changes and regular people get the same access to other alts as they get to bitcoin, and they get to see what all do they'll make a pick and it'll for sure won't be bitcoin, unless bitcoin is upgraded, low fees and instant transactions is what we need and that will keep bitcoin on top even when it is technologically inferior, if that upgrade doesn't happen then the future of bitcoin is uncertain.
Just do your research on different alts, read their white papers and notice how they are superior to bitcoin, and not superior just because they changed one line of code like in the case of bch but superior because they are completely revolutionary and with very amazing technology.
Just look at ethereum versus bitcoin tech wise, even though ethereum is kinda being left behind too but they are already developing upgrades right now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:14:27
Basically the private key is what gives you access to the funds in the wallet, without it you won't be able to spend them and if you lose the private key those funds will be forever locked, that private key should be hidden because anyone who has access to it can access the funds and spend them.
The QR code is just a code used by scanners or cameras, it is the same private key encrpypted in that QR code, if your camera reads that code as the public key then it is the QR code for the public key, you should have a private key and public address, and a different QR code for each one.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:28:23
They all have different use cases, bitcoin was the first to come and the one that gave birth to all of the rest, it's evolved over the years and it's gaining more and more popularity, no other alt with similar use cases will be able to replace bitcoin, there may be or perhaps most surely will be alts that will be by the side of bitcoin even price wise in the future with their relevant use cases but bitcoin won't be replaced nor will it fall, don't buy in the food, crypto currencies have a looong way to grow..
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:51:25
Agree, with so many crypto currencies coming out that have revolutionary technology and are working, that also have tons of features as well as instant transactions and are partnering and sheered by giants it's hard to see bitcoin gaining much value anymore like it did in the past if bitcoin does not fix this issue. People are also realizing that bitcoin doesn't deserve the value it has if it can't be used as a currency, people don't talk about bitcoin only anymore, they talk about a bunch of other cryptocurrencies. 
If we don't find a way to fix the transaction and fees issue then bitcoin will probably just continue to lose it's share of the market. It may continue to gain value of course, but it won't be much.
So please fix this, i had a transaction take 3 days to confirm and i really needed the money, and it only confirmed in the end because i increased the fee through electrum, if not i bet it would still be pending now. =(
You know what's bad too? Coming here to try and vent because it is a problem and getting called names by everyone in the sub. I remember a long time ago when this sub was a great point to come to and discuss bitcoin, now it's filled with... and actual smart threads get lost in the new queue while memes and nonsense are in the front page 90% of the time.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:41:09
They are not dishonest, just this month there were 5+ bitcoin forks coming out, they have a lot of things to work on, way more important things like improving costumer support, implementing segwit and many more things, they can't keep up with their current milestones because of their huge growth, much less have time to hire hundreds of developers just to work on bitcoin forks alone.
They owe nothing. Be it that their customers know or do not know it does not really matter. 
Imagine if they stopped to work a couple of weeks implementing a fork, then during that time another 2 came that they also had to support and so they continued to work on those, and so on, they wouldn't be able to work on anything else it would just slow them down. If you want your forks, keep your coins on your wallet not on the exchange.

They are not, when generating bulk wallets there you are given receiving addresses and their private key pairs in bulk, you have to use the private key for each address to spend them
Also download the website from their github and run it from an offline computer for maximized security and safety. 
Edit: Just checked, and by "Use the original wallet file you generated in step 1 to spend them.", they mean the step where you generate privatekey/address pairs in bulk and copy/save them, the "Single wallet" tab is a completely different feature.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:27:25
Do you mean generating a wallet from a brain seed?
Okay, then use this too 
HOWEVER, use it in an offline computer! At the bottom of the page you can see a download button to download the code, then run that code on an offline computer, better yet if that computer wont run online for a long time. Then generate any address you want with any seed you would like to if thats what you are after, just try to make it extremely hard, common words brain wallets are usually watched by bots that catch any bitcoins as soon as it reaches the address, just try to generate a wallet with the seed "wallet" and check the address so you can see what i mean, incoming transactions that are taken by bots out as soon as they reach the wallet.
Tick "Custom Seed or Brain Wallet", untick "Compress", then place "wallet" in the field that appeared and hit generate, and check the address.

Perhaps noone is moving bitcoins anymore because their bitcoins are already where they wanted them to be? Exchanges, etc? I know i moved all of mine to an exchange a couple of weeks ago and it took like 4 days to get there. Anyhow, even if it was spam they are still valid transactions i keep saying that because it is true, it just uncovers the problem, what the ever the solution is LN or anything else we need it fast or we keep losing market.

It is already hitting bitcoin hard, just looks at ripple, completely opposite of what crypto currencies should be and it just hit 2nd place by marketcap, low fees and almost instant transaction times but a coin from the banks and for the banks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:50:02
Maybe because of the price you are seeing is against USDT not USD. It's the same accross all exchanges that use USDT instead of USD not only bitfinex, check poloniex, binance, etc... It is 15500 right now at gdax meanwhile it is at 14500 at Binance.

Valid points. Indeed, Roger talking shit about bitcoin on social outlets for the world to see and saying it is basically a scam while advertising his clone didn't make much sense as noone would willingly put money in either at such a uncertainly situation. 
I really believe that's why alts are flourishing, the past few weeks they have gained so much market it's insane, and it'll probably won't go back to bitcoin anymore as it used to, now are people are both invested in alts and bitcoin, it used to be that everyone invested in alts to get more bitcoins. Even with this past crash there were a lot of alts that were basically unaffected when that never happened, when bitcoin crashed it used to bring everything down with it.
I think that's a strong sign that something needs to be done asap. I'm all in on ICX right now as i really like the project and so i think it'll continue to spike for a while, but my end goal is just to increase my bitcoin stack in the end and while there are probably a lot of people like me there are also a lot of people that are no longer thinking in terms of bitcoin but in terms of whatever alt they hold now.

As long as i know sweeping implies that the funds from your paper wallet will be send to your wallet on electrum, and yes a fee will be paid.
You could also directly import the private key on electrum which means you'll be using the same key right there and you won't have to move the funds anywhere. 
Also you won't lose your funds, they'll eventually confirm when the mempool starts to clear, or if you set a fee way too low then you'll transaction will be kicked out of it and return to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:14:06
Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin addresses have the same private key, i mean, if you have the key for a bitcoin address, that key also works for the same bitcoin cash address. So yeah they can just use the private key for that bitcoin cash address on bitcoin and they'll be able to access the funds.
However Kraken as i know has a huge backlog right now so you'll be waiting for some time.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:10:46
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:22:00
Try restoring the seed into electrum, that should work! 
When setting it up select standard wallet &gt; i already have a seed &gt; then try the seed, if it says it is invalid then click 'options' in that same section and tick bip39 seed hit ok, then it should allow you to try a seed with any words on it. That will work!
Please keep us updated. Also, after restoration go on and create another electrum wallet with a new seed (dont tick bip39 this time) and send the funds to this new wallet. Or better yet install a wallet in your smartphone since thats a lot more secure than having it on your computer, specially if you run windows!
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:43:48
They have been having problems with their system so they have been focusing on updating it for a while, that and receiving tons of support request everyday for different issues.  It could probably take months for them to help you out unless you find a way to speed it up.
I made a mistake with a xmr transaction where i didn't include the proper id at another exchange, solved that in under a day through their telegram group. I doubt kraken has social media support though.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:37:53
alright, then it could also mean it was generated in a different way other than bip39, do you have the wallet file? Is it encrypted? You should be able to recover it directly from the wallet file. If it was generated in a different way then the private keys would be different than the ones you are generating now through bip39. 
A good way to confirm this would be if the wallet you just generated has any history, do you see any transaction history there? .
Edit: I see you have a key. Try using that key on electrum but instead of going through "create a new seed", click "use public or private keys"

Dude, could be spam but they are still valid transactions. It just shows that bitcoin has a huge problem.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:02:32
I hope so. We still need to let a few days go by to be sure though.

There were a bunch of posts like this one yesterday too after it "recovered", then it went even lower today. Maybe this time it is indeed the end of the crash but nobody really knows.

Why use bitcoin cash for day to day transactions when there are better alternatives out there though? That i don't understand. One widely accepted one being litecoin but there are tons more.

Probably someone running bots to vote their own reply and downvote the rest, some people suck that much. Careful @_date: 2017-12-13 04:59:52
I always tell my friends all that i know and like about bitcoin, i do however also tell them that they could lose their money because there are so many different factors involved so that they keep in mind the risks and don't blame me if it happens..

What about just replacing it with another one like what's happening right now, and not talking about bch my man, talking about tons of other alts that are raising insanely fast, ripple just took second place by marketcap.

Yeah, it has gone as high as 1.1:1, when bitcoin crashes everyone rushes to tether thus making its price go up as well since you're trading your bitcoins for someone elses tether, when things settle it goes back down to 1:1
Supply and demand. It shouldn't affect tether but it does. It has also gone lower at about 0.98:1 or something like that in the past if i recall correctly.

More like not wanting to read more from someone that uses that expression, my god i have read that in so many threads it seems like everyone are just repeating what others are saying. If you want to be taken seriously. Lay out your words properly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:15:58
Oh, my words have affected you? Tell your mommy i didn't mean to make you cry, kiddo. Treat others with respect if you expect to be treated with respect.

Bright enough to have made billions, at least bright enough to take advantage of dumb people.

That's quite different mate. Ripple made swings of 5% up and down yesterday, and it kept going up, there were great news about ripple and everyone was talking about it, then came profit takers who made the price crash due to stop limits, then the price goes back up but higher, then back down and so on.
As long as you know it's not a fake pump and dump and that the increase in price is sustained by great news and that it still holds tons of fuel it's quite easy to day trade, i do it with amounts higher than 1btc because 5% of 1 btc is 0.05, so you gain a lot with each trade. There are loses too but my gains have outweighed my loses by far so far.
Anyway ripple was yesterday, and todays, there's a different coin for different occasions, a few days ago it was litecoin with everyone fomoing in on coinbase, before that it was cardano, and before that it was iota, and so on. 
I lost a lot of money and made no gains in the beginning though, that was needed because i was learning a lot of lessons. I didn't know anything back then and that's why most people hate day trading because they have no idea how to do it and just lose money.

Good for you, i too hold bitcoin though i'm a day trader i always look to increase my bitcoin stack and not my USD =) right now i'm in another coin trying to protect myself from all the drama that's going on, once things settle i'll go back to bitcoin with even more bitcoin because this alt is performing quite well, well many are right now.

Deluded bcashies or no coiners. You expect the price to double every few days? Take a look at the past two months chart weirdo.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:52:36
Some points look pretty legit though. Others are retarded, like the security one.

I checked [one of your other comments]( where you explain what you have been doing to help your people, you're such a kind soul.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:58:15
I see, i wish i could help, could you give me your btc address so i can donate a bit? I saw that each $1 lets you serve one to two meals to the homeless.
