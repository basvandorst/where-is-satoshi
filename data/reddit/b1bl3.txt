I own  domain and websites,email me your offers guys.
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:45:42
That why is not free :)
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:09:20
from what i understand in blockchain everything,every transaction is stored,so when someone will know you address he will know everything about you.think about your id is stored on one address and maybe in future you will not be allowed to generate a lot of addresses but only 2 or 3 ... so that 2 or 3 will be your.I will know everything you do.. basedd on your addresses.
@_date: 2016-09-19 18:41:08


















So it can happen ! This is about my thread !
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:45:24
This not convinced me  ( me as many other ) come on,when there will not be governments ? Maybe not more maybe one for all but will be.The world is playing after rules for the beginning of time.
You think that banks will disappear ? 
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:05:15
come on u understand it
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:39:24


You are free for now but governments make the rules so what if in future you are not allowed to use your own address and so on..? What if you cant spend bitcoin without their rules and so on ? This governments searching for many years to know everything about people and now im thinking that this tech will make it.

@_date: 2015-04-24 01:11:43
what is shady ?
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:04:29
So,How i said in my thread : 
We work on a project to launch the biggest BTC network where we want to bring all cryptocurrencies communities in one place.
The idea was : why to open so many browsers on pc for chat,for post,for news,to trade and so on ...
Why dont have all of this in one place.
People from crypto world now are looking to spread the words about btc about crypto currencies to the world.
We all are waiting for the biggest networks to add crypto coins to use it there and so on ...
We can create a biggest network for crypto world with the features for crypto world.
So i created SyncBit as the Facebook of crypto.
Half of the project is ready you can create an account and test the SyncBit.IO
We are in connection with a big crypto exchange to add it to the syncbit by API 
They take 2% for any transaction on their website and we agreed to give us 1% on any transaction that users make on our website.
Also we want to add casino games on SyncBit.
Also we want to add tipping system on SyncBit.
Also we are thinking to create a coin and to use it only on our network for beginning.
Users will tip each other.
We will change the "like " with "tip"
Think about when people from the world will heard that they can get tips not likes ...
Think about making money by posting,by sharing ... 
In short time can be a big success.
So,once all of this are ready and we will launch the website the profit will come from casino games,tipping system,trade area and advertise.
Also we created 69BTC.COM and BTC Adult VideoChat where users can use BTC to tip girls..
Also we can get profit from the launch of the coin that we will use on our network ( this is the idea that will be talked by the members when we have all the founds ready ) so is as an additionally idea. 
We dont need millions how we read about all this big companies we will do all of this with 25BTC.
That why we are looking for investors and we sell 1% at 0.58139535 BTC
So think about this,test the websites  and  and think for the future.
This is not an investment in any ponzi scheme or anything else,is an investment in a crypto service that will value much more in the future.
Think about selling it in the future with only $100 000 and only 1% will be $1000
Think about when there are some 200 000 or 500 000 of members how much will value the website.
But how much will value when there will be 1 million members ? 
Think about selling the website in some years in 2 or 3 year with some millions,im sure that only 1% will value a lot.
You can replay us on contact
