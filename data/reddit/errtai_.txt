You're comparing what is essentially a commodity to the entire stock market, soooo yeah you're dumb.

I'm not sure that blatant corruption is something to celebrate.

So this isn't a permanent thing? Thank god.

Good thing I traded all my SoJs for Ist runes in 2008.

Hey I bought 5 at $10 each so I'm pretty happy whatever comes. Just saying huge volatility doesn't bode well for future widespread adoption which would really make it skyrocket.

This scares me. Too volatile.

I would love to but I have no idea how to do so. The transaction no longer appears in my Multibit wallet since I did the blockchain reset, and when I clicked on the transaction before I did the reset it would take me to a "transaction not found" page. Is the public address just the address I sent the coins from?

I have seed words, but since I made the wallet in 2013 I'm hoping they're for this particular wallet. I used multiple wallets to test out moving btc around before I spent any. If they aren't the correct ones do I have no way of getting my btc back?

Possibly. I also have the private keys exported though I'm not sure what I can do with those (someone else mentioned they would be useful). I downloaded electrum could I restore it there?

In the transaction details it says "click to view transaction on blockchain.info", and when I click it it takes me to a blockchain.info page that says "this transaction does not exist". I can't do that anymore though because since I did that blockchain reset thing the transaction doesn't appear in multibit either. It's also weird because if I look at all the transactions from that wallet, subtracting all the values from the original deposit adds up to ~0.15 but instead it just shows a big fat zero.
I exported the keys, though I'm not sure what to do with them.

I bought at 10 dollars and I keep thinking I should sell before remembering I have no idea how to do that.

I'm terrified I'll wake up one day and they'll be a million bucks each but I'll still have no idea how to exchange them. That may confuse you but for context I'm really really stupid.

My initial investment was $50 and I sold some to my friend when they were $1000 so I'm okay.
