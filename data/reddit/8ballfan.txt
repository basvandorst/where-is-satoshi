Why are you sure that it will happen? The bull run I mean.

Well then, put your money in a mutual fund and wait a few years. Why are you here? :D

Is there a way to cash out my bitcoins in the Netherlands and not pay taxes if I live in another country in the EU where you have to pay like 30% (I know) ?
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:38:06
There are many ways that are safe aside from hard cold cash. You can sell your BTC and get paid via Western Union for example..
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:15:38
But, he will have enough btc that will make him rich. And if the fiat suystem collapses it would be because the world has adopted the crypto system which also means he can buy lambos with his BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:04:02
Get a Tesla then, I believe you can buy a Tesla with bitcoin.

OP, update us on what will happen in your case. Thanks!

What does consolidating outputs mean? Anyone care to explain? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:21:14
Yes, thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:37:25
It can be if it's fraudulent (made by another person). It's called a "transfer recall".
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:08:00
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:36:53
Well that number is not odd either. It's not an integer.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:02:43
You mean like a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:36:31
What is the name of your bank? Let me guess, BP? ;)

Name at least 3 ways to generate new coins without giving them to miners.
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:57:14
Some countries don't have credit card cashback.
@_date: 2018-09-15 09:28:41
Then how do you want to generate new coins?
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:33:26
Probably got changed recently. In France they lowered it from 3000 to 1000 just last year..
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:35:15
No I don't think there is. They probably pay with their credit card. Checks are also used in France.
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:38:21

What's wrong with France?
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:36:56
The numbers have nothing to do with it being alpha, beta or in final version.
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:54:47
He literally said why after that sentence.
@_date: 2018-10-02 07:32:30
Get the same price in bitcoin then add 7-9% to it. This will allow you to sell the bitcoin and get the same value even if the price declines.

Can you please elaborate on the last one, an end to spam? I'd like to know more.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:16:17
What is that?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:26:12
Aren't there fees in Bitcoin too?
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:04:09
I knew something was not quite right and that the latest version is 3.3.3 (I have 3.2.3).
I quit Electrum altogether and started it again, and I could send my bitcoins. Anyone has any idea why restarting made that message disappear?
@_date: 2019-04-21 12:19:29
I beg to differ, using Localbitcoins would have been a better idea, as he wouldn't have been able to deleted the conversation and I would have had proof. I should have done that..
@_date: 2019-04-19 21:52:38
Yes, I realize that was a mistake now. His messages couldn't have been deleted if they were sent on localbitcoins and they could have assisted in getting his IP and other information..
@_date: 2019-04-20 21:15:10
How do you do that?
@_date: 2019-04-20 10:20:09
Thank you, and yeah you're right. They gave me the cash and saw which pockets it went in, then as soon I refused to give it back and showed them blockchain proof I was assaulted and they immediately went for it. My jeans pockets have been torn with a knife, I'm glad it didn't cut through my flesh.
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:54:18
No, please do not do this. He could easily take a screenshot of the wallet app, change the QR code with another one and then claim he didn't receive it in his app wallet.
@_date: 2019-04-19 21:50:57
He deleted the whole conversation, it just disappeared from Telegram. He denied deleting it.


That's what really helped my side with the police, the fact that they ran away.

Amazon is never going to accept Bitcoin. Anyone thinking otherwise is just dreaming.
@_date: 2018-11-04 18:28:47
I heard they'll keep it in a paper wallet somewhere where a goat can eat it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:20:45
Postal code? Are you kidding me?
You do know that when people use separate accounts they use different names, right?
@_date: 2018-03-08 11:35:13
They would never use Bitcoin for the simple reason that they can't link different accounts to the same person. Credit cards and bank accounts offer that functionality, which is really useful to Amazon.
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:27:10
42 is the answer to everything ;)
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:19:39
Okay, I wonder if you could have said the same thing in December.

How can I try a bunch of passwords and see if they work on the json file?
There seems to be a lot of websites where you can paste the text and try to decrypt it with the password but that seems risky as hell, doesn't it?

SCAM! Do not send your BTC to this guy. HE obviously made this shitty Belfrics Trade site to scam people.

Actual help here : There are two guys on [localbitcoins.com]( selling bitcoins through NBK or KFH (I guess those are banks in Kuwait?) and another one selling through Paypal. Contact them and I'm sure you'll find a solution.
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:38:14
I don't know what you're talking about. Banks can deny you service in France and when that happens you have to talk to La Banque de France and they will appoint some bank to open one for you, but it probably won't be the best for you.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:35:16
Seems like this is a fake email. Are you sure it came from Paypal?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:42:02
They have to sell in order to pay the electricity and their employees which I'm sure they paying in fiat ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:01:55
I don’t remember it, I tried logging in to blockchain.info but it didn’t work.
Is there a way to decrypt the wallet.aes.json file?
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:19:02
Yes, it requires ID and proof of address, which ironically is EXACTLY the two documents you need to create a bank account here in France. So much for banking the unbanked.

Define "lot of money".

I didn't mean to try all possible combinations, just a bunch of passwords that I have in mind.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:37:30
Where did you get that quote?
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:38:02
Maybe you need to deposit one last time to your 1 address for the 3 address to be generated.
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:25:27
No. Volume

I sold bitcoins to someone else who had a Revolut account. They sent me the money through that app and I sent them the bitcoins.
I showed Revolut the list of the transactions I made with that person at person and they were okay with it. But after a week or so they just blocked my account and said that my balance will be returned to the original source.
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:55:12
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:52:38
No, I sold them to someone and they sent me the money through that app.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:24:47
I really don't know. The person who bought the bitcoins said they never received anything from them.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:23:46


Sorry, I should have specified that I didn't buy with revolut, I sold it to someone on an escrow platform and they paid me using revolut.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:01:24
I should have specified that I sold crypto to someone else and they paid me through that app.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:32:50
Yeah but don't they at least make it under review until they determine if the transaction is fradulent? The first time they blocked my account I submitted screenshots of my transactions with the buyer and they were ok with it.

If the police seize your computers, phones, etc and they find a wallet that contains said crypto, that is proof that it was yours.
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:36:43
If you receive a bank transfer by mistake and you don't want to send it back (either to the bank or the original sender), they could legally sue you and win. Why isn't it the same for crypto?
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:18:09
Well said.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:04:43
And where are you?
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:00:31
That's not true. Anybody can go to localbitcoins right now and see that there are ads in Iran of people selling and buying bitcoins in Iran. What's with the FUD?
