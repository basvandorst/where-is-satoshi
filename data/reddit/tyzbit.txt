A usability overhaul.  Right now, it feels like every transaction is an IP packet I'm crafting and sending off.  It feels really neat, but at the same time, it should have less friction than sending an email.

Technically, any transaction not included in a block can be overridden with another transaction sending the same coins again, with a higher fee.  This is called a double-spend, and is why you need to wait for at least one confirmation because once a transaction is in a block, any attempt to spend the same coins will always fail*.
Most wallets don't give you the option to do this, but most wallets do let you either:
* increase the fee if you sent the transaction as RBF capable in the first place
* create a Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) transaction with a lucrative fee, which will force miners to include the low-fee transaction in order to also claim the higher-fee transaction.
It varies greatly by the wallet but I think many wallets will treat the transaction as failed after two weeks.
20sat/b is incredibly low, and at this point you're hoping for an altruistic miner to include your transaction out of the goodness of their heart, instead of higher-paying transactions.  Most miners won't do this.
*Those very familiar with Bitcoin will point out this is not technically true, because of forks, 51% attacks and so forth.  It's most correct to say that with each successive block after a specific transaction, the cost to modify the block and double-spend the transaction increases so as to eventually make it infeasible to do so.  That's why Satoshi recommended 6 blocks, which if you're sending hundreds of coins or more, I don't see why you wouldn't wait an hour just to be on the safe side.

It depends entirely on the use-case.  Paying some dude for a guitar off of eBay? Yeah, normal Bitcoin with it's 10 minute confirmation times is perfectly acceptable.  Preferred even.  But if you buy a coffee every day, or pay your electric bill monthly, or want to get paid for a job hourly or **minutely**, Lightning is where it's at.  Just like how planes and cars coexist just fine, so too does normal Bitcoin transaction usage and Lightning.
I'm not concerned about centralization because the barrier to entry to open a channel is so low, and there will be light clients (heh, get it?) as well.  Check out Eclair on the Android store.  It opens channels just like the rest of them, it just doesn't relay transactions and the experience is _so nice_ at, for example, [starblocks](  Near instant payments, trustlessly, backed by Bitcoin, with security properties like Bitcoin that incentivizes playing nice and punishes bad actors.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:26:19
From a quick search, it seems the only requirement for LN is for the node to be SegWit compatible, and SegWit is compatible with pruning nodes, so Lightning _should_ be compatible with pruning nodes.*
However, at least `lnd` already requires additional block headers to be stored so that LN light clients can do [Compact Client Side Filtering]( so it depends on implementation of the Lightning spec, I guess, and how many different types of clients you want to support.
*this is based on a very quick search; I could be wrong.

I know this isn't the right place for this, so please forgive me, but when I tried Samourai Wallet, they require access to the JSON-RPC interface for trusted nodes if you're to use one.
What in tarnation makes it require _that_?  If it didn't need that I'd probably be using it but I see no reason to allow _control_ of my node to an app that should simply be passing transactions along.

I've noticed Lightning addresses are [publickey]  Does this mean users who do not have a static IP cannot run a full lightning node?

@_date: 2018-01-28 17:18:36
Unfortunately, I'm not in my element here, so don't wait on account of me.  Do realize though that the barrier to entry to connecting any two nodes is one on-chain transaction, and nodes have an economic incentive to make the network efficient, because any inefficiencies between nodes can be exploited to act as the transit node for that pain point.

I imagine only paying $30 to securely transfer a billion dollars sounds pretty useful, right? Even transferring $10 with $30 of fees; I can get it to anyone in the world without anyone having the authority to stop me.  That has _some_ utility you just can't replicate with VISA or ACH, right?
This is just Bitcoin doing price discovery for its own services, combined with its meteoric rise in value compared to dollars.  Lets put it another way: if you had a physical $10 bill that could jump from your hands to anyone you chose within 10 minutes, while being verifiable by anyone else that it happened, and being **unstoppable** (think of how it'd have to physically tunnel through walls! lol), what would this magic $10 bill be worth? Definitely more than any other normal $10 bill. 
 What would a service that could turn any bill into a bill like this be worth? Would you pay $30 to turn any single bill into a magic uberbill? You probably wouldn't waste it in single dollars, now would you? You'd use hundred dollar bills, or bigger denominations if you could.
It would be impossible to have 1 satoshi fees for every transaction because the blockchain would spiral to unmanageable sizes so there _must_ be some fee rate above that.

This is, by far, the best way to help.  I know it's boring, but this is how you help when you run testnet _first_:
- finding bugs (they're out there!)
- learning the basics of operation on your own, with no stress about losing real money
- learning the fundamentals behind the technology
- when you decide to set up a neat shop or way of accepting funds on Lightning, you're already ready to go with testing it!
- you help the devs build a bigger network to further stress the network.  Testnet is much larger than mainnet, and has offline nodes, crazy channel capacities, nodes with tons of channels, different software versions.  It's the perfect place to really eke out bugs.
- when you're finally ready to run mainnet, it's second nature.
I spent a couple weeks running a testnet node, playing with things, backing up the data directories, restoring, sending test funds, buying fake coffees before I felt I personally was ready for mainnet.  Then _I had to code in mainnet support_.  That's how not-ready this software is.  In hindsight, I'd say I was just barely prepared enough, and I've spent literally days worth of hours on Lightning, coding, graphing, researching since I've hopped on mainnet.

As I dig, I see more and more interesting (read: shady) things.
First, none of some key text strings in [the bug report]( ([rawgbt]( [gbtTime]( [Kafka]( show up in [the codebase](  As it turns out, in the README it states:


And the code in GitHub is just for major releases.
Searching [for]( [those]( [there]( proves fruitless as well.  BTC.com appears to be running their code in [Docker]( which [pulls in the .tar.gz release]( when it's built.
So in summary, I don't see how those strings are being printed to the output using the same source code ostensibly provided as Bitcoin-ABC code, either in GitHub or Phabricator.  My guess is either they use obfuscated or encrypted source somewhere (which is a **major** red flag), they pull in additional code when the program starts (not a good idea for open-source software to "phone-home" for additional code) or they're using a different code base for releases.
**MAJOR DISCLAIMER**: I've been looking at this for like _10 minutes_.  I'm not making any claims, accusations or anything else of any kind, for any reason, to anyone, at any time, ever.  For any reason.  I have looked at 0 lines of code.  I have not pulled down any releases yet.  All I'm saying is, I don't see how that source code produced those debug messages.

So the node validates your phone's transaction? This doesn't make sense as validation of transactions happen on the normal Bitcoin port; that's a full nodes purpose: _to validate and relay transactions_.
The only thing I could _possibly_ think of why the software needs this is somehow in relation to it's [Ricochet transaction]( feature, but that appears to just be a mixing service Samourai provides where you send them Bitcoin, and they create intermediary transactions between you, them and your final destination.  It doesn't appear that Ricochet requires a Trusted Node.

Yep.  If it's 10+ hops to the "other side" of the network, you just open up a channel there and then nodes near you can use you to hop over there.

True.  I was speaking in general terms, because to laypeople a credit card and a debit card function the same.  Ostensibly, the credit card company does have to accept certain levels of fraud and preventatively deny transactions with a high risk of fraud.
The point is still the same, even money sitting in a checking account is not your money.  It is their money that you are owed.  In the case of credit cards, it's worse since **you owe them**, and **they have complete control over what you do with your card**.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:22:19
Yes, there is a simple solution.  Every node has/will have settings that dictate how it operates, and that in effect will limit how many hops from it it is willing to route, how much it charges for routing over it, etc.
So if you start getting ddos'd, as a node operator you would just raise your fee, which would go to pay increased network and CPU time.  No one will use your "hub" if it costs more than an on-chain tx.
Also, read what I wrote above: 


Without channel capacities, this visualization is pretty, but not much else.  Some nodes are useless and others are crucial, and the number of channels they have is not a perfect indicator of which is which.  I'm working on getting a view into that, but this isn't really my forte and I'm learning a lot of tools as I go along.  It's been *very* exciting though!

if you're expecting literal 5 year olds to understand any part of bitcoin except the "internet money" part, you're gonna have a bad time.
Let me rephrase a little bit: if you don't know what malleability, block validation and size, and signatures mean, you're out of your depth here.  I continue to be concerned that more and more laypeople have gotten into Bitcoin without investing in the requisite knowledge to be adequately proficient in using Bitcoin in it's current and medium-term state.  Think the BBS, dial-up, 3600 baud age of the internet, except when you dial the wrong number to get online, you lose all of your money.
I'm more than happy to let thieves steal your money, and to let you [accidentally destroy your bitcoin]( so mine is more valuable, but don't expect me to feel sorry for you because you didn't bother to learn basic concepts about how these _powerful, dangerous, **experimental**_ tools you were using worked.  A $250 **billion** experiment, but still very much experimental technology.
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:41:29
I did some calculations from the perspective of my node on the network.  Every node's situation will be different, and their routing will also be different.  But here's mine:
(DISCLAIMER: Every Lightning Network implementation at this point is, at best, _beta software_ at this point.  We don't know what the network will look like when the participants are not nearly all reckless beta testers.)
Process: 






[My node info]( (7 active channels)
All of my channels were manually chosen with some chosen because I knew the individual personally, and others chosen for opportunistic reasons.  For example, I opened a channel with Blockstream's store, bought something and left the channel open so others could route through me to them.
Total Nodes(at the time): 283
Nodes for which routing this payment was not possible: 78 (27%)
Average Channel Size on the whole network: 460,000 sats
Degree of separation (number of hops) and number of nodes with this many hops:








You can see some similar info [here]( regarding the degree of connection, but this does not try to actually route a payment, just whether or not a node is connected.  It's possible to open channels too low to actually be usable for anything other than very small amounts of satoshis, or even 0 (though I don't think the softwares will allow this once they're production ready.)
Summary: If I wanted to send about $5 directly to someone on the network _right now_, I could do so for 63% of all nodes.  I would be within 4 hops of the reachable nodes, and within 3 for a whopping 98.1% of those nodes.  I only have 3 channels funded with at least 45,000 satoshis; if my balances on my other channels were better they too could be used for routing.  I can use those channels for smaller amounts, which would raise both the degrees of success (as the other end would be capable of receiving such an amount) and lower the degrees of separation.  In addition, if myself and another node wanted to transact a larger amount (say, 1BTC), it would make sense to just pay the tx fees to open a channel, move the funds and leave the channel open for routing.  I could also just make a normal BTC transaction and leave the LN out of it.  Another important point to note is I didn't calculate the TX fees for these routes (I think it took 6+ hours for this to run), but I saw another user write:


I think our difference in experience here ("every node I can see on mainnet") is I didn't filter out nodes that were visible, but unconnected (go [here]( and scroll out to see them around the edges.  Those may make up a large percentage of the nodes for which I could not find a route).  Also, my fees right now for sending this amount would be very low.  I picked one of the furthest nodes (one of the two that are 4 hops away) and calculated the best route and fees:
    {
    "routes": [
        {
            "total_time_lock": 506649,
            "total_fees": "548",
            "total_amt": "45548",
            "hops": [
                {
                    "chan_id": "555933969840144385",
                    "chan_capacity": "500000",
                    "amt_to_forward": "45547",
                    "fee": "1",
                    "expiry": 506645
                },
                {
                    "chan_id": "555979049713467392",
                    "chan_capacity": "200000",
                    "amt_to_forward": "45546",
                    "fee": "1",
                    "expiry": 506501
                },
                {
                    "chan_id": "555985646893989888",
                    "chan_capacity": "200000",
                    "amt_to_forward": "45000",
                    "fee": "546",
                    "expiry": 506487
                },
                {
                    "chan_id": "555139022879522816",
                    "chan_capacity": "761500",
                    "amt_to_forward": "45000",
                    "fee": "0",
                    "expiry": 506487
                }
            ]
        },
My total fees for this payment would be 548 satoshis, or 6.4 cents.  Most total fees are much less than this currently, with many nodes charging 1 or 10 satoshis (though one does charge 39518209, lol).  In the far future, if sending a payment to a node proved to cost more than an on-chain tx (hundreds of hops), then I could simply open a channel near the other side of the network and drastically lower my fees.

Method: Exported a list of nodes and edges to two csv lists and imported them into Tulip, then clicked the Bubble Tree visualization.  It seems there are about 6 "hubs", two of which could be be called "hyper-hubs".
It's important to note that while every line here represents a channel, it does not represent a viable route for a given payment.  For example, while this isn't the case, if the top-right node's channels were replaced with 100 satoshi ones, the graph would look **identical**.  But any payment of 101 satoshis could not use that node.
Future plans: I plan on better visualizing this data, taking in channel capacity into account.  Tulip is not a very stable program.
Edit: I was able to coax out a [video]( of a 3D force graph of the network.  The algorithm I used was [GRIP](

It's kind of irresponsible to release software until it's been thoroughly tested _especially when there's money at stake_ but there's nothing stopping you from pulling down the repo and `go build`ing it.
The devs just don't feel comfortable releasing mainnet until it's at a bare minimum of stability, security, usability and general quality but obviously people are enabling mainnet or pulling down that branch or whatever and using it as evidenced by TorGuard using it.  There are also 3 different software at different levels of implementation of the Lightning protocol; some might be mainnet ready but if they are I'm not aware.

**yep, absolutely**! 
so long as Bitcoin doesn't have a fatal flaw it's useful as a currency and programmable money and it has arguably the most talent behind it _and_ withstood the most attacks.  Plus at $5 with the fees where they are now, that's back down to a penny per transaction.
Bitcoin is a venn diagram between a lot of things, and the investment part isn't all of it.  I'm here for that part, but I'm also here for the part where I can send money to anyone at any time according to rules I set _without anyone's permission_, plus the financial rules behind Bitcoin are favorable.
People give that one guy shit for spending 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza but they forget he paid someone _on the other side of the world_ with basically zero (or actually zero, not sure which) fees within 10 minutes. Plus Bitcoin was so prolific he could have easily replaced his spent coins (and maybe did).

Blockchain is often confused for Bitcoin.  They are not the same.  A blockchain can be created that is _worse_ than a database and offers no additional utility.  Bitcoin is built on the concept of a decentralized, permissionless, open blockchain and it's only with these properties that this implementation is worth anything.  Remove one or more and you quickly have to compensate in more and more costly ways.

To put it plainly, all channel updates on the lightning network invalidate previous channel states by publishing secret information for previous states.  If you try to broadcast a previous state to the blockchain, it's timelocked for 3 days.  In that time, the other end of the channel can see that transaction and, using the secret information you transmitted, take all of your funds in the channel.  This incentivizes all participants not to cheat.
Now I'm not sure if this is one channel or *all* channels that your node forfeits, but I believe it's one.  Please, if someone more knowledgeable knows the answer, chime in.

Full nodes definitely use a lot of bandwidth if you don't constrain them, it's basically like seeding a torrent forever. Mine uses about 200KB/s if I recall correctly. Your options here are to limit the number of connections it makes, rate limit its connection, or disallow connections entirely. Even an unreachable node is a net positive for the network: it's another copy of the blockchain and it's another individual vote as to what software is Bitcoin, plus it's a net positive for you since you can still use your node to broadcast your transactions.
Opening any port to the internet will make you less safe, and Bitcoin is no different. From a purely software perspective, Bitcoin is probably one of the most scrutinized software in existence, so with that in mind I feel comfortable opening that port up to the world; Bitcoin is expected to be attacked and abused and the software has rules to deal with all that, from DDoS attacks to sending garbled or malicious data. I would say of all the software you could expose to the internet, Bitcoin is probably the safest but there still is a chance of some attacker using some unknown exploit using that port. I'd say HTTP servers are much more likely to have an exploitable bug than Bitcoin, since they update their codebase at a much higher rate and there are so many different implementations (nginx, Apache, IIS, etc).
One final note: it's important to also consider the political implications of running full nodes, in the data center or in your home. Using Bitcoin is sort of like a vote against the current financial system, and everyone currently _using_ that financial system doesn't appreciate us voting against it. By running a full node, you are putting a sort of target on your back from a number of types of individuals:
- your ISP, who may not like the traffic Bitcoin generates or may try to interfere
- people who want to see Bitcoin to fail
- people who want to steal Bitcoin
And more. Any by running a full node, you alert these people to your political intentions.
I hope I didn't scare you off of running your own full node, and I hope I explained what running it on your own hardware really means. But remember, Bitcoin was built, basically from the beginning, to support using Tor to communicate not as an exercise for geeks but because someday, we may need it. Bitcoin will inevitably be attacked from every angle. It has before and it will in greater depth again.

Thank you for the responses already, and I sort of see where you're coming from, but in other apps and in theory, if you specify your node's IP, the app will only connect to that IP and use it for broadcasting transactions.  The only port required to broadcast transactions is 8333.
Opening up the JSON-RPC interface requires the wallet to be able to connect to it, which may mean opening up to the internet at large.  This is not advisable; while the interface is authenticated it's like opening up RDP to the internet.  In addition, giving a wallet RPC control of your node seems like overkill.
Let me rephrase my question: Why does SamouraiWallet **need control** of my node, if I am to use the Trusted Node function? What guarantee does using the JSON-RPC interface provide? I understand the feature is optional, but it seems like a very queer design decision, and one that decreases privacy overall.

Nodes are colored according to settings set by the node operators.
Lines are channels between nodes.
Nodes that fly off into the background do not have any visible channels.
Line colors are representative of the channel capacity, but is colored dynamically.
EDIT: some more info now that I've had a chance to take a break---
Mainnet is **not** ready.  The nodes shown are reckless enthusiasts who have accepted the _very likely_ possibility they will lose money due to a bug or other things.
How was this generated?
I ran this command from my machine running `lnd`:
    lncli describegraph | jq -c '\''{ "nodes": .nodes | map({ "id": .pub_key, "alias": .alias|match("[^\u0000]+")| .string, "group": 1, "color": .color }), "links": .edges | map({"source": .node1_pub, "target": .node2_pub, "capacity": .capacity|tonumber }) }'\''
I then plugged that into the Gist data, and adjusted the parameters [here]( to suit my needs.
I plan on generating a testnet graph, however my testnet node got obliterated so I'm resyncing and I won't have as full of a view into the network as possible.
EDIT 2: [Here]( is a testnet graph.

Truthfully: No.  This really doesn't tell us much.  I'm trying to get better visualizations that would be able to tell us the actual usability of the network, but without more than just raw connections to each node, we **really can't** (**and shouldn't**) draw any conclusions from this.
Every node can generate his/her view of the network though.  For now, the [Reksplorer]( is still one of the best places to get a feel for what the network looks like

I believe (someone correct me if I'm wrong) that the Great Firewall is pervasive, not just an internal -&gt; external thing.  This is not a huge effect, but I do recall some discussion within the last couple years that over 2MB would cause the Great Firewall to come into play regarding latency, and for some reason I recall it being a net negative for Chinese miners (miners in other countries don't have this small amount of increased latency, so even though the hashpower is concentrated in China, it gives miners in countries without a Great Firewall the latency advantage among themselves).
Bottom line is that I believe the tweet is accurate, and I'm sure someone has data collected from tests and real-world usage to speak to orphan rates in China vs everywhere else.

Consider a single intelligence analyst.  Smart, but not rich.  Possibly gets bored from time to time, but gets to play with some seriously hardcore exploits and hardware.  Consider this analyst gets bored and decides he'd like to make a little money on the side.  He knows how a couple of these exploits work (hell, maybe he wrote the code for some) so he just "brings his work home" with him one day and puts a tempting link in a place people with Bitcoin are known to congregate.  Someone clicks it, he lifts their Bitcoin, they come here and whine that they must've had a virus or something.
Now, multiply by the ~~thousands~~ millions of intelligence analysts _worldwide_, combined with state actors as a whole acting against each other, **combined** with the fact that some governments might be feeling left out of the crypto game while others are jumping in feet first and you get a _very_ compelling reason to use as much security as possible, defending in depth as far as you can.

Your next step should be to see if your situation would allow you to run this on your _own_ hardware :)
Nodes running in DigitalOcean still help the network, but they're not under your full control, and so **you give DigitalOcean authority over what you think Bitcoin is** (if they wanted to, they could shut you off _because_ you were running a bitcoin node, or insidiously tamper with your traffic or block you).
I know it probably sounds like a broken record, but this whole idea is based on _individuals_ having power, and you're one of dozens or hundreds of nodes on DO.  We're not at risk of losing the blockchain any time soon, but DO definitely can disrupt you trying to make a payment through your trusted node, or spy on you.

You can't partially spend Bitcoin.  A property of Bitcoin transactions is that when you unlock the coins, they all move.  If you attempt to move _some_ of them, whatever's left over won't go back to the original address, but will be **eaten up as miners fees**.  I guess you could have the change address be the original address, thus sending them back but I don't know if that could work.
Take an imaginary street with quadrillions upon quadrillions of houses.  Inside each house is basically the same number of drawers, each with a lockbox that contains a private key but virtually all of them don't have any Bitcoin sent to them.  When you generate a key, you pick a house and drawer.  (The house represents your public address, the drawer represents your key.
When people send you Bitcoin, all they need to know is which house.  When you spend Bitcoin, you reveal what drawer you used (but the key is still in a lockbox).  That means that before you spent your coins, an attacker would have to try the lockbox of each drawer in your house, which there are a seemingly uncountable number of.  **However**, once you spend your funds, an attacker no longer has to check any other drawers, but instead can focus on just the lockbox in yours.
Now, if you only want to send some (which is usual), you can:
* put the funds back into the lockbox that anyone in the world now knows contains Bitcoin
* pick a new house and drawer, which is easy, free, and would give your funds the most protection.
Now to stretch the metaphor further, every signature leaks some data, but a very small amount.  Normally, that's not a big problem, and it's good enough for most things like securing web traffic.  But if you were to spend again, and send back to the same lockbox, now the attacker knows twice the information they knew previously about your key.  How much this helps is the subject of academic study, but suffice to say if you sign enough data with the same key, it lowers the difficulty of bruteforcing that particular key.  That's why most cryptographic systems have a method of rotating keys out if they sign lots of data.
**tl;dr**: If you spend from a paper wallet, spend it all and send it to a new address.  It's the default way, it's the safest way, and it's worth whatever extra effort (reprinting wallets, or re-etching the keys into metal)
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:24:38
So a couple things.
* First: I talked about following the talent.  That throws Vertcoin right out. (:
* Second: It doesn't matter what arbitrary block time a coin has, it's up against the speed of light and coins with 1 minute block times, at some point in the future could run up against high orphan rates simply because the whole network collectively doesn't have the bandwidth to propagate the whole block in 1 minute.  This sounds ridiculous, but eventually, blocks will probably have to grow as we approach the limits of what neat math tricks can do.  I think 10 minutes is a good block time because it gives people with less processing power and slower connections a chance to participate.  I want to see more nodes in space, I want to see more nodes in remote areas of the world and with short blocktimes, you effectively reduce those node's power. High block times are directly addressed by second layer solutions such as LN and sidechains.
* Third: _wasting energy_? I've seen this come up a lot and it shows a bit of a lack of understanding on your part.  Bitcoin uses that power as the basis for its security.  The total hash rate (and by extension, the Joules poured into it) is the bar that needs to be surpassed in order to attack the network.  It serves a **vital** purpose, and every user of Bitcoin has an incentive to make that bar as high as possible.  It should be out of the reach of some countries.  It should be out of the reach of some **combinations** of countries.  I don't want Mexico to suddenly decide they want Bitcoin to fail, buy/manufacture a bunch of miners and attack the network successfully.
* Fourth: _destroying the planet_? This is a fun one. So if one things that energy is wasted, they're apt to believe that all those Joules, sometimes generated by less clean power sources, will harm our planet.  [This video]( is my response, but in short: Bitcoin mining can subsidize _clean_ energy and allow return on investments quicker.  In addition, _because_ of those block times it's possible to find the cheapest energy for mining in remote areas, which are _always renewables_ because after the infrastructure is built, you pay zero for fuel.  So like Andreas mentioned, in a way Bitcoin mining is subsidizing clean energy.
* Fifth: compare Bitcoin to other stores of value and the amount of energy and effort required to maintain them.  The USD requires "the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government" which means the military, the bureaucracy, the billions of actual bills printed on actual material distributed by actual trucks, boats and planes virtually every one of which burns petroleum as fuel.  So yeah, I'll take the one that can be solar powered in the desert, please.

I like Freedom, I like Trustless, I like Decentralized but I think the cornerstone of why Bitcoin is the future is that it's Permissionless.
Like an ant colony, there is no central authority planning the structure, just simple rules every participant follows.  From these rules, a beautiful structure emerges where individual actors use the system for their benefit while at the same time improving the system for others.
It's crucial to Bitcoin's health that anyone can be any component of the system without anyone's permission--from designing the protocol to mining blocks to just creating a Bitcoin address.
It's from the permissionless nature of Bitcoin that the decentralized, trustless, free-to-do-anything properties emerge.  Because there's no need to ask for permission, there's no need to create an authority to give it.  Because there's no central authority, it must be decentralized.  Because it's decentralized, the system must be built with the minimum amount of trust possible.  Because you verify, instead of trusting, you have the freedom to do whatever you deem safe.  Everything stems from being permissionless.

What would you prefer: a fast moving coin subject to bugs, breaking changes, and possibly decreased security **or** a resistant-to-change, "do it the right way the first time" secure store of value?
No, I'm serious: what do you want? Because if it's the first, then it's **not bitcoin**.  That's okay, though, there are plenty of fast moving, agile altcoins with very respectable development teams.  They make some _really_ fascinating technologies, and I'm excited to see what they create.
But Bitcoin is slow.  Bitcoin is as methodical as possible.  Bitcoin tries to plan ahead and build the cornerstones of this technology as solidly as possible because down the road, it might be near impossible to change.
So I don't mind that Segwit adoption has stalled.  I don't mind that it might take years for LN to be mainstream.  I don't mind that at all, because in this grand cryptocurrency experiment, **consensus is king**.  And I'm running Bitcoin, I'm using bitcoin, I moved my coins to Segwit addresses and I'm going to open LN channels myself so I can use it, so my friends can use it and so I can use bitcoin both as a immutable store of value _and_ as a day-to-day payment method.  And if exchanges and payment processors are too slow in adopting SegWit, the permissionless nature of Bitcoin means there's always room for new players.
And while I've taken your comment in good faith, do know that people make the same argument as yours with the intention of painting Bitcoin as less attractive than, say, Etherum.  But not everyone knows the story about Ethereum Classic.  A perfectly legal usage of the system was reversed simply because it was undesirable for a large number of people.  I also remember Mt. Gox.  When it seemed the world was ending for Bitcoin and it _truly felt like the bubble had burst_.  Thousands of Bitcoin stolen.  Hundreds of thousands.  But the Bitcoin devs shrugged and said "stealing someone's private keys and creating valid transactions with them is a completely allowable use case for Bitcoin".
So in long-winded conclusion, be patient.  This is a giant, trillion dollar **experiment**.  Moving fast and breaking things _is the exact opposite of what anyone should want from Bitcoin_.

No user of Bitcoin would be resistant to increasing the block size if no other technical solution was proposed. Just like adding more wheels lets trucks carry bigger loads, increasing the block size is a sensible way to scale the network. But we have to look as far ahead as possible and realize we can't just keep adding wheels. We might have to build tracks. And yes, tracks mean more rigidity and more centralization, but on these tracks we can carry even heavier loads. And none of these scaling solutions are incompatible with a block size increase. None of these scaling solutions are incompatible with each other. They will all work together to increase the value of Bitcoin as a whole. And if Lightning and SegWit can't scale, then we'll increase block size. But don't forget, SegWit brought a block size increase with it, technically. Up to 4MB of transactions can be included in a block.
Finally, Satoshi talked about upper layers built on top of Bitcoin. If your personal solution has to be one Satoshi envisioned then you should be just as excited about Lightning as I am.  But then again, Bcash was never about scaling. It was never about creating a better technology iteratively. Because if it was, it'd be a simple PR against Bitcoin Core and it'd be merged if it was worth it's salt.
No, Bcash is about centralization of control of the destiny of Bitcoin and I feel very sorry for anyone who doesn't see that.

Right, and miners only tend to act in their own self-interest, they are not forced to.  But as they act less and less selfishly, that gives other miners incentive to act more selfishly and as a result help the network by processing transactions that include reasonable fees.

I know it's frustrating, but understand this is one of the biggest attacks on Bitcoin, ever and though it sounds quixotic to say, **Bitcoin is working as intended**.  These attacks are costing people a lot of money, and those who have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin fail **are spending piles of Bitcoin to spam the network**.  The technology doesn't care if you're a small user, a big user, sending a few satoshis or thousands of bitcoin, all it is concerned with is the size of your transaction and that it follows the rules of the protocol.
You still have options during spam attacks.  You can create Child Pays for Parent transactions to move your initial transaction through, or if your initial transaction was created with it, you can increase your tx fee afterwards.  Additionally, **use SegWit!!!** It allows for up to 4x the amount of transactions included in a block, but last I checked we're still only at 15% utilization.
Finally, I think it's good to keep a little perspective.  This is still experimental technology.  Even with two days to confirm, it's on par with the ACH, and still beats it in terms of reversibility and design.  How much is the elimination of fraud from the operators of the network worth to you?

Not exactly ELI5, but hopefully good enough to get a passive reader up to speed.
Confidential Transactions (CT) is a way to obscure transaction amounts on the blockchain.  It allows for anyone to verify a particular transaction keeps the supply of bitcoin exactly the same, but only the sender and the receiver know the amounts.
One of the requirements for CT is a changed transaction verification scheme (Bulletproofs) that for "normal" one-input, one-output + change address transactions is (currently) 40x slower, but actually scales incredibly well as you add more inputs and outputs (the more signatures you add, the less storage per signature you need).  One plus side is this would fit very well with CoinJoin-type transactions (and indeed, might make it more economical to do these types of transactions, making the more private usage scenarios the cheapest).
This particular paper is describing the latest technical updates on getting CT to a place where it's actually feasible for Bitcoin.  Currently, 40x decrease in "normal" transaction verification efficiency is not acceptable.  In addition, this already poses a new set of problems which currently has no perfect solution, but two solutions diametrically opposed to each other.
With CT, you can either allow perfect mathematical privacy and accept the possibility that someone with enough quantum computational power could create Bitcoin out of thin air, **or** you can ensure the integrity of the supply of bitcoin and allow someone with enough quantum computational power to unmask CTs.  This is a serious debate to have.

I don't have it.  What I do have, however, is a long period of low activity, [followed by a burst of activity and higher-than-normal fees]( coupled with the Bcash fork, Coinbase allowing Bcash trading, the difficulty re-adjustmenb, _and the financial incentive for Bitcoin to look unappealing so Bcash looks appealing_.
Let me put it this way: if the people in charge of Bcash and/or the people who stand to profit from Bitcoin looking unappealing _aren't_ spamming the network, they're far less intelligent than I thought, and I try my best to be accurate and not generous with my appraisals of intelligence if you know what I mean.

Yes, it seems obvious what the more important outcome is for virtually all of us, however it's still a choice that every participant must make if our understanding of the limitations of CT deployment on the Bitcoin network are correct.  Consensus is not dictated, but emergent.

Exchanging cash for bitcoin is a little difficult to do at 14, you should get your parents help to sign up with an exchange such as [Coinbase]( [Gemini]( (US-based) or [Bitstamp]( (International).

Spam transactions are still valid transactions from the network's perspective, and there are currently users with **lots** of bitcoin spending **lots** of bitcoin to spam the network.  Also, _I'm_ more than willing to pay competitive rates for a permanent, immutable, pseudoanonymous store of value, but VISA and the legacy banking system still exist, feel free to keep using them.
Bitcoin won't replace all of these technologies just like television didn't replace radio.  In addition, Bitcoin is still evolving and the lightning network is very close, which will allow for much lower cost transactions and more day-to-day use cases.  Bitcoin is not perfect but lucky for us, Bitcoin is open-source.  These growing pains are just that, growing pains.  Every problem has a solution, and every solution is a balance of compromise between security, decentralization and usability.  Never forget that Bitcoin prioritizes those **in that order**.
What's the point of the network if it's not secure?  Why did we build this if it's not decentralized?  Only after those first two are prioritized should we then focus on usability.  And as evidenced by every day the whole Bitcoin network doesn't come crashing down, it's still secure.  As evidenced by the node I run in my own home, it's still decentralized.  And as evidenced by each block full of transactions that's consecutively found, it's still usable for some.
SegWit + Lightning hopes to help make it more usable for everyone, and if you want to improve the network, implore your wallet provider and your exchange to support SegWit.  The developers have already implemented technology to help alleviate these scaling issues but we're only at [15% adoption of SegWit]( and that's our own (and the spammer's) fault.

Bitcoin functions reasonably well as a store of value, but its value isn't only in it's self-bootstrapped value (in other words, its perceived value), part of its value over time is in the technological capabilities it has.  Bitcoin is currently used mostly as a "dumb" money, but with Bitcoin you can set up quite complex contracts, even artificial constructs to store, move, protect and manipulate value.  Gold can't be securely and irrevocably returned to its sender if the recipient doesn't fulfill some obligation; bitcoin can.
Bitcoin is like a programming language for money or value; right now it's like we're at the "punch-card" stage of computers where mathematicians, accountants, graphics designers were all laughing about how these computer programs posed no threat to them.  It's only going to accelerate exponentially as more radical, innovative and foundation-shaking apps are built on top of it (and other cryptos).

I don't use electrum, but it depends on the size of your transaction, which Electrum may or may not show you before you make it.  As the FAQ mentions, if your transaction doesn't confirm in a timely manner, you can increase the fee (if you originally sent a "replace by fee" TX) or create a Child-Pays-For-Parent transaction to help move it along (basically a transaction moving the resulting coins from this transaction that has a lucrative fee; this forces miners to also include the previous transaction).

This is very costly, which if you just used it to mine bitcoins instead of trying to reverse transactions you'd probably make more money anyway.
More technical info: mining is basically generating random numbers, running them through a one-way function and checking if the result is statistically unlikely (turns it into a sort of lottery, with more hashing power making it more likely you'll find a block).
* hash input: j9f3jfas
* hash output: b2c7646dde8319b025a2b6680c784b808b582029e74d58fd82481fc46263e160
(note: I used normal sha256, not the variant bitcoin uses)
Since this does not match the current requirements for a found hash (needs to have a certain number of 0s, basically), you have to try again and that input is worthless.
Now part of the input must come from the block before it, so once a new block is announced, it's everyone's chance again because no one will know what the new block's portion of the input will be until it's found.

Lightning Network is currency agnostic, provided the underlying blockchain has a few key required features.  It almost sounds like that's exactly what you're describing.
Lightning can do atomic swaps where you can trustlessly swap Bitcoin for Litecoin.  This is possible with any blockchain that has transaction malleability fixes, plus some other specific requirements I'm unable to find right now but many coins meet the criteria and many more could if they wanted to.
I think many alts have interesting value propositions, and some of them even have interesting development happening around them.  With that said, I think any alt whose value proposition is "Bitcoin but we added/fixed X" is rather pointless.  Along those same veins, I think people vastly underestimate how powerful Bitcoin really is.  Programmable money, even if it's not Turing complete, is something you can't quite improve upon until you've found its limits and we've not even scratched the surface of those limits.
So in conclusion, I think it behooves an adept crypto enthusiast to find the most secure crypto first (because what good is cool crypto if it becomes worthless due to a bug?), then the crypto that has the highest technical skill around/behind it.  Finally, a well-informed crypto enthusiast that truly understands where the power of crypto comes from should follow/use the coin with the most genuine consensus with the largest number of participants.  So far, since 2009, that's been Bitcoin, from what I see.

Do we really need *more* people in the space who watch the price every day but don't know what a private key is? Sounds like building a castle on quicksand to me.  We can still train those "Coinbase-only" users, though, to actually be Bitcoin enthusiasts and solutions already exist for layer one that are simple enough to use for most people.
Again, my point isn't that Coinbase doesn't "onramp" users, it's that those users are not

* actually using Bitcoin

With splicing, that's possible.  You can splice into a channel (top-up, in other words), or splice out (send to any on-chain address from the channel while keeping it open).
It's a planned feature.

The keys stay on the wallet, the computer just says "please sign this" and the wallet either signs it and sends the signed transaction back (which will be broadcasted anyway) or refuses to (for instance if the user presses the cancel button).  At no time does the potentially compromised computer have access to the private key.

`lnd` is written in `Golang`, while `c-lightning` is written in `C`.  Both are under active development, and both can open channels to each other just fine.  It really comes down to preference: What are you more comfortable doing: compiling, installing and running a program in Go, or compiling installing and running a program in C?
Also, `lnd` has a REST and gRPC port built-in to assist developers, while `c-lightning` requires additional software to interact with the daemon from other software.
The nodes also have different defaults (which can be changed, of course) with regards to fees, locktimes etc.

1) Exchange for fiat once received, if required.  TX fees are still negligible.
2) If the sender sends to the wrong address it's no different than getting the bank account number wrong.  If either the sender or receiver's machine is compromised, how is that a flaw with bitcoin? How does a bank wire, which involves many more machines with less cryptographic protection, offer more security in this aspect?
3) I don't understand, what recall are you referring to?
My point is with a wire transfer, bitcoin offers the following tangible advantages:
* Speed  
Wire Transfer: Days  
Bitcoin: 10m+
* Cost  
Wire Transfer: at least $10, up to $50 or more  
Bitcoin: .0001BTC or about 5 cents USD.
* Security  
Wire Transfer: Rely on the banks to maintain account balances, rely on banks to keep account numbers secret, rely on banks to transfer correct amount, rely on banks to actually approve the transfer ($10k+ triggers certain KYC regulations)  
Bitcoin: transactions are permanent, verifiable, indisputable proof of transfer of any amount of value.  
* Ubiquity  
Wire transfer: Not all people have bank accounts, not all banks will painlessly transfer funds, especially in different countries, banks will charge to convert from one currency to another  
Bitcoin: anyone can use it, there's only one currency to worry about.

Rather than debunking "Bitcoin is killing the planet", instead reframe the question as "Is Bitcoin's power consumption (and by extension, carbon footprint) justified, for the resulting service we get?"
For me, that question's answer is a resounding yes.  Every kilowatt spent honestly mining Bitcoin is a kilowatt that a bad actor would have to spend to attack it.  And what we get, of course, is a decentralized, secure, uncensorable store of value and payment network.  Also, Bitcoin can be mined globally, so long as you have Internet, so Bitcoin miners can subsidize construction of cheap and renewable power _right at the source_.

Lightning is still very immature, and under rapid development.  **This means fund loss is still possible**.  If you accept the risks, **and don't mind learning**, then continue on.  Lightning also requires that you understand the concepts of **nodes** and **channels**.  There's a lot of good info out there already, but as a techie-type, I like the [dev Lightning Community]( site.
Be aware that things can still get fragile at times, and require technical skill and the ability to troubleshoot issues.
Here's how you can try it out:
1. Install **TESTNET** [Eclair](
2. Fund it with coins from a [Testnet faucet](
3. Wait for the funds to confirm
4. Visit [Yalls.org]( on your desktop, click on any article and click Continue Reading.
5. Click the QR code button, and use the QR code on the right to open a channel in Eclair mobile.
6. Wait for channel confirmations (you'll only need to do this once for yalls, and possibly once for other merchants)
7. Once the channel is green, attempt to pay invoices and marvel at the speed with which you can make these payments.  Plus, since you have a direct channel, you pay no fees for each of these off-chain payments
8. Now, see if you can directly pay [Starblocks]( even though you don't have a channel with them.
Once you run through testnet, there's a mainnet Eclair wallet as well, and there are some merchants offering mainnet Lightning payments such as [Bitrefill](

That's a great approach to take, and I applaud your spirit.

Why does the card need to have an ID? The merchant just needs to communicate the invoice to the customer.
A better design (with the exact same UX) is have a lightweight NFC+Bluetooth card that reads the invoice from NFC and passes it off directly to the phone via Bluetooth.  No need for the merchant to read any data.
Better still, allow the app to be extended to smartwatches with NFC, which can be passed over the terminal and the payment approved then and there.

I would think:
1. Install bitcoind/bitcoin-qt
2. Fund the wallet
3. Run your script that listens for the event
4. When the event fires, the script calls the RPC to send funds to the address you need.

It's a cost vs benefit, in my opinion.
If all users are aware that aliases are like self-applied nametags, then there's not much of a cost.  The benefit? You get just a little more information about nodes.
If users are mislead into opening channels with malicious nodes via the aliases, then the costs start to outweigh the benefits.
Right now, I think aliases are harmless, but that situation could change drastically.  The key part to watch out for is **developers** making products that use/trust them.  As long as **code** ignores aliases for decision making, then the onus is completely on the user.

Samourai requires your JSON-RPC port if you use your own node, which is not good practice.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:30:54
No, not if you're looking at data from your node. Every channel, for instance, needs actual funds to be locked up, and your node checks the blockchain to ensure that's the case.
@_date: 2018-05-07 21:26:46
Channels can be funded by one side (customers would fund their own channels to you, then make payments out of them).  Lightning allows for instant settlement, so if you receive 100 satoshis you can immediately turn around and spend them somewhere else on Lightning.
Also, of course, Lightning transactions aren't limited by the base chain so you can have thousands of transactions per second or more.  Scales with more CPU or lower latency between the links, but it's just packets on the wire.
Even if those two things aren't enough to entice you, Lightning can atomically swap between compatible cryptocurrencies.  So you could swap X Bitcoin for Y Litecoin using nothing but a cooperating Lightning node.  This kind of swap is **atomic**, which means either the whole trade completes or everyone keeps their coins.  There's no way someone could do half of the trade and get away with it.

Yes, splicing implies that an on-chain event (funds getting sent to, or taken from, OR even splitting the channel into multiple channels OR even combining multiple channels into one channel) happens to a channel.

I think it is probably accurate to say within the next few decades, we'll all be using cryptocurrencies in our daily lives.  Bitcoin must be hardened and prepared for the rise of CentralBankCoins, just like it must be hardened and prepared to fight against government-issued cryptocurrency like Venezuela's.
Don't waste time mindlessly bickering, don't let FUD cloud your judgement.  Be a Bitcoin expert, teach Bitcoin concepts.  We need to be skilled and grizzled _before_ CentralBankCoin becomes a thing, so we can fight the sure-to-exist sockpuppet armies and FUD.

The fact that Satoshi himself might hold 1/21 of the entire money supply gives me pause.  Satoshi must be the truest believer there is.  Either he can't spend his Bitcoin because he lost his keys, or he puts all other HODLers to shame.  I think Bitcoin fails Satoshi himself though because if any of the addresses associated to Satoshi moves, people could think he sold his coins and the value will plummet.  Of course, no one knows for *sure* **all** of Satoshi's addresses, but still -- Bitcoin will be truly fungible when Satoshi can spend his coins and we won't know that he's done it.  And that future's not impossible, especially with recent proposed improvements to Bitcoin.

Right now, the Lightning Network is like the old bulletin board days of the internet.  You need to know the telephone number and dial-in to the bulletin board manually.  I'll try to answer each question in-line.


I think you mean common nodes, as a channel is just between node A and node B, but a **node** can have channels to lots of nodes.  To answer the question, no right now most people are opening direct channels themselves.


Not currently, but soon the payment process should give your Eclair node enough info to find a good node to open a channel to for any given payment.


The ACINQ **node** is a node operated by ACINQ intended to help ease new users of the wallet onto mainnet.  They open channels to common merchants and they get to collect (tiny, very tiny) routing fees for doing so.


It's hard to tell, but probably.  It's up to node operators to manually open channels with enough balance to cover payments right now if they want to be used to forward payments, and like I mentioned above, it's very early in the evolution of Lightning.


The Y'alls **node** is displayed when making a payment, click the QR code icon and it's the right QR code.
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:28:40
Capacities for public channels are actually advertised, but **balances** are not.  This way, anyone can build possible routes to try for payments.
For **balances**, you can figure out where the balance in a channel by trying to send payments one way or another through the channels - if the payment goes through then you know they at least had enough to cover _that_ much.  This does mean you have to spend your satoshis on routing fees, and open up channels that can use those routes.

I think of it this way: replace pseudo with semi.
Bitcoing being semi-anonymous makes sense, as on its face and in practice it requires no link to a specific identity, but if you know what addresses someone controls (or has controlled), you know their balance and transaction history.
Now consider [pseudonymity]( it necessitates the introduction of a pseudonym, like an artist who wants to see how people really view his art by releasing it under a pseudonym.  It's not anonymous on its face, it's linked to an identity, just a false one.  Bitcoin (the technology) is never linked to an identity.
@_date: 2018-05-16 00:41:40
I wrote more about what I mean [here]( but TL;DR:
* No one has a “full picture” of the Lightning Network, because of its decentralized nature
* Channels can be hidden or private between nodes, and not announced to the network at large
* Lightning can operate on multiple compatible blockchains, separately or at once.
The decentralized nature part is a big one.  It's not reasonable to expect everyone to know about everyone--all that matters is that you yourself know about the nodes you need to know about.  Some parts of the network will just be too far from you for your node to care.  My graph probably looks different from yours because who we initially bootstrapped from, and who we have channels with are different.
Contrast this with, say, the UTXO set of Bitcoin.  Anyone in the world can check this set for themselves or on any honest node and get the full, same answer - it's objective, not subjective.

There are no known exploits that completely break TOR, just known vulnerabilities such as timing (if you log on, [send a bomb threat]( then log off, investigators can correlate the time with the time the threat was sent) and exit nodes always having access to the traffic as it exits to the internet.  It is better than not using it if you use it wisely.

From my perspective, bitcoin does look anonymous but isn't.  The addresses are random characters not directly linkable to an identity. I don't think pseudonymous would apply, as it implies a pseudonym (like Mark Twain or Dr. Seuss); the whole conversation is around being anonymous, not specifically about being anonymous via a pseudonym.

An investment in BTC-E is an investment in bitcoin, and should it fall it would also undoubtedly affect bitcoin as well. We need to use the tools at our disposal to either get these exchanges up to par or get them out of business before they get to the size and position of Gox and can do damage. Posts like this as well as awareness and action on the part of its users help us accomplish that.
Just writing it off as "someone else's problem" is shortsighted and egotistical. You touched on an excellent point, greed. We need to make it uneconomical for bitcoin companies to be anything other than reputable, either by voting with our bitcoin/fiat or hurting their bottom line in other ways.

You're absolutely right, Linux is generally easy to get running and is pretty easy to use. My argument against it is that its akin to having a new set of awesome roads that you want people to ride around on, but when people tell you the best way to use the roads, they say you really only should be driving a tank on them. It's change and it will prevent mass adoption.
Again to reiterate, I'm not saying Linux isn't easy or a good solution for security, I'm saying it shouldn't be given out as the best solution for security. Unfortunately, there isn't an easy solution that I know of that is also accessible and secure, but that's where bitcoin entrepreneurs come in :)

I'd have to disagree. Bitcoin is advantageous to consumers especially because there is a much smaller opportunity for fraud; I could spent bitcoin at a shop 1,000 times and both the shop and I know that as soon as the transaction is included in a block, it's pretty much permanent and spending that bitcoin doesn't give the shop an opportunity to spend my money without permission like credit cards.

Because the whole point of bitcoin was to remove the necessity of trust in a 3rd party; why do you need a 3rd party identifying you and aggregating your data just to send some money? What if you don't trust this 3rd party, a valid complaint given bitcoin companies' track records? The best practice is to implement only what is necessary to perform the desired function, and the only thing necessary to securely send bitcoin is a public address.

It will be determined by consensus at that time, and if your transaction does not include enough it will probably not be picked up into the next block, if at all.

That's why the correct and accurate term is pseudo-anonymous - bitcoin is not truly anonymous in its current state, but if you generate a brand new key and someone pays you, there is nothing anyone can do to identify you using bitcoin or the blockchain at any time, forever, until you spend the coin.  Who owns what addresses is 100% anonymous, but transactions are not.

Here are some compelling reasons why the average consumer would prefer Bitcoin over any other payment method
1. The use of Bitcoin does not mean giving out information that would allow unauthorized payments. This is exactly what happens with credit cards. 
2. All transactions are permanent. This is a good thing for the consumer, because it means there will never not be proof of payment. The need for reversible transactions would be lessened, if there were institutions that I provided Bitcoin insurance or a Bitcoin service provider providing transaction reversal abilities, through investigating and recovering stolen bitcoin funds. 
3. Bitcoin allows for instantaneous communication of payment, and while this is not from the perspective of the consumer, PayPal having my money for the last month is a compelling reason for me to use Bitcoin only. (Sold something on eBay). 
From where I sit, many of the flaws with bitcoin are not with bitcoin itself, but with bitcoin's infrastructure, which do need to be upgraded and replaced if it is to be successful.

If you want to do it for fun AND NOT TO ACTUALLY OWN ANY IMPORTANT AMOUNTS OF BOTCOIN, look for GUIMiner. You won't make any appreciable Bitcoin. Like pennies worth. And you'll also need to join a mining pool. Again you will not make any appreciable amount of Bitcoin. You'll probably pay more in electricity costs.

The value fluctuates. Plus, it's like mining for gold, there's an initial investment required to start, often thousands of dollars of equipment. And the exchange rate so far has kept most people from making much money unless they've been mining and constantly upgrading their equipment the whole time.
To be clear though, some people have gotten rich and cashed out to dollars. Many who believe in bitcoin think that the true value of a Bitcoin is worth much more than $900, so they hold onto their coins until eventually they can get paid in bitcoin, pay their mortgage in bitcoin, and buy goods with Bitcoin.

Yes, they're called [transaction puzzles](  It's essentially like mining a single transaction.

Trying for a literal five year old here:
Lots of special computers try math problems looking for a special answer.  When one finds a special answer, it gets to broadcast it as a **block**, then the process starts over again.  Because they found a special answer, everyone agrees that they should get a payment for their work, which is 12.5 bitcoin right now.  In addition, if they add transactions to the **block**, they get to collect the fees people have paid for their transactions.  This makes their reward even bigger, so most miners include as many transactions as they can.
They try to make the problems just difficult enough that a special answer should be found every 10 minutes.

The biggest part? The address isn't fully obscured.  Knowing any part of the address can help you find the transaction.  Plus, almost as crucial or maybe moreso, the amounts are pretty unique.  
**edit**: *I couldn't search for a partial address on a web service after looking for about a minute, but I would hazard a guess to say you could issue a command to a bitcoin node to search the blockchain for transactions that had an address that matched what you can already see.*
Combine that with the fact that bitcoin's transaction volume is low enough that manually navigating the blockchain is extremely easy, and you've got a good recipe for being unmasked.
Honestly, even if it was 10 years in the future and blocks regularly included tens thousands of transactions, obscurity still isn't enough to guarantee privacy. Just knowing about when a transaction was confirmed limits your search to a single block or a very small handful.

- The dollar continues to be an inflationary currency
- Bitcoin continues to be a deflationary currency

Instead, ask them if they want to get paid in 10 minutes versus 24 hours like VISA.  Ask them if they want zero chargebacks, ever.  Ask them if they want low fees.  Ask them if they want to be in control of their own money.  Some merchants will answer no, and they're free to make that choice.

Kind of; the code can't account for everything so there are additional lists you can import for nodes that spy or have misbehaved in the past.
Most miners should run a full node if they can, I'm not sure but I think it could help with getting the newest blocks faster and announcing your own blocks faster, reducing orphans.
I'm not a miner though, so it's possible that's not true.  In any case, you still get the same benefits as a non-mining user running a full node.

Bitcoin relies on the network as a whole not misbehaving.  Most miners have to be honest (which is why the most greedy thing they can do is be honest), most users have to send transactions they actually want confirmed (which is why spamming the mempool is a dick move), and most nodes **have** to be as neutral as possible.  This means the best thing any single user can do for bitcoin, **besides accepting it for goods and services** is to run a full node that is the following things:
* as neutral as possible (blocking bad actors is fine, but all of the latest versions of the Bitcoin software do automatically).
* on as many separate networks as possible (If Amazon wanted to block Bitcoin traffic on their network, Bitcoin needs to be resistant to this).
* is not run for the purpose of spying on the users (much like TOR, Bitcoin's pseudo-anonymity can be weakened by more malicious nodes running, seeing who connects to whom and correlating transactions with IPs).
* **most importantly**: Running the code **you** want bitcoin to be.
Bitcoin is based around consensus, and that consensus stems from all of the software used to run it.  Most people think of miners when they think of the important software that keeps Bitcoin running, but it's the whole ecosystem.  With all cryptos, hash power follows value, and authentic value comes from perceived utility (unauthentic value comes from pump-and-dump, shady tactics etc).
@_date: 2015-07-26 02:50:05
They don't help distribute the network load of both new transactions and getting the whole blockchain?  They don't provide additional security by increasing the number of honest nodes to mitigate a bad actor trying to perform a 51% attack?
Like I said, I totally understand that people should run nodes at their houses/in their own data centers wherever possible, but they're truly not helping by running a node at DO?  Am I unknowingly downplaying the possible risks?
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:50:01
Okay, fact checking real quick.
Yes, the device can steal private keys through the air.  However, it relies on the device decrypting specially crafted cyphertext:


So implementations of encryption technologies that rely on reading the private key to decrypt data (PGP was mentioned, I'm guessing SSL as well) are at risk if given specially crafted encrypted data and if the attacker is near the computer at the time of decryption.
The only time bitcoin needs to read the private key is to sign transactions, and that's a one-way process (user specifies address(es) and amount(s), software uses private key to generate signed transaction and transmits it to the network.
Someone with more clarity into the process feel free to jump in here, but I don't see much implication, if any for bitcoin.  Once POS terminals become more commonplace, if this attack vector has not been mitigated, I could definitely see "poisoned" terminals using this to scrape private keys from customers, depending on the implementation, somewhat similar to [this attack against Trezor wallets](

I absolutely detest these exchanges requiring this information, but in the current climate, that is the price I have to pay; bitcoin enables near frictionless exchange of value and trusting someone like Coinbase with my information is a worthy trade, because of two reasons:
1. There are repercussions and ways of obtaining reparations though the usual channels (lawsuits) in case of data breach.  While I hope it just doesn't come to it, I don't feel completely helpless with them having my information.
2. In the future I envision, those who hold bitcoin will have more freedom than those who dont (even for someone in the U.S. now, perhaps [that future is now]( With the events unfolding in Greece it's especially prudent I start to hold as much value as I can stand in bitcoin before the next major wave of adoption hits.

If your node has no wallet, then you won't lose funds but it's by no means safe. You're allowing a wallet to control your node completely. That means **it can manipulate your nodes peers until you're no longer anonymous**. It doesn't need that ability.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:04:30
Just popping in to correct an inaccuracy in the article.


**This is entirely wrong.**
If one participant goes offline, the channel is unusable for payments or routing.  Bob can try to cheat and transmit an old state where he had more money than Alice but:
1. That assumes Alice doesn't come back online for a certain amount of time.  If she does, she can punish Bob instantly for *all of his funds*.
2. That also assumes Alice didn't contract out the work of watching her channels for cheating to a 3rd party called a Watchtower.  Then even if Alice goes offline and Bob tries to "roll-back" a channel and get it confirmed on-chain, the Watchtower is able to punish Bob as well, and could then choose to share funds with Alice if they wished.
Further, when either side tries to cheat, they wager **ALL** of their funds on being able to get _some_ of the other party's.  As an example:
Alice: 1 &lt;-&gt; Bob: 1   Total Capacity: 2
Alice pays bob .5
Alice: .5 &lt;-&gt; Bob: 1.5
Bob goes offline
Alice goes to the chain with the first channel state, which would mean she gets .5BTC back:
Alice: 1 &lt;-&gt; Bob: 1
If Alice succeeds, she makes .5BTC.  If Alice fails _she loses the rest of her initial 1BTC_ since Bob or a Watchtower _can sweep all of her funds_.  This only happens when one side tries to cheat, not go offline.

The RPC **controls the node**.  This means the wallet can:
* ban peers
* shut down the node
* adjust runtime parameters
You don't need that to simply relay transactions from a wallet, even securely and anonymously.  So either the devs are inadvertently promoting bad practices **or intentionally promoting them**.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:21:32
It's an issue.  It's something we need to improve, and discuss solutions to.  But here's the way I see it:
SHA-256 is not a fundamental property of Bitcoin.  It _can_ be changed, and quite easily in a crisis (but may consider it "the nuclear option").
So we have two possible outcomes:
1. Miners act in the users best interests and SHA-256 continues to be Bitcoin's PoW algorithm.
2. Miners act against users best interests and Bitcoin pushes the button and makes their infrastructure worthless for mining Bitcoin.
Scenario 1 is how things have historically gone, and though it's an uneasy configuration, I think it's workable.  Still, finding ways to better decentralize mining should be a priority.
Scenario 2 hopefully won't ever happen, but Bitcoin has survived a lot and I think it could survive a PoW change.

The question was probably made in good faith; I know I've seen occasional stories out of Venezuela that people are taking to mining digital currencies and goods like RuneScape gold, World of Warcraft gold, Bitcoin/altcoins and so forth simply because while they may not net much to make them worth anything in another country, they're an attractive option in Venezuela as a hedge against the massive hyperinflation.
For reference: RuneScape and World of Warcraft are online games that have digital currency (not crypto) that people farm for a living.

Every Lightning node connects to other Lightning nodes as necessary and receives "gossip" information about channel states.  You don't need to connect to all of the nodes, or even most of them to successfully gossip and get a good idea of the current state.
However, because of this design, some channels, especially ones that are "further away from you" will be unknown to you, either because they are not oft-gossiped about, they haven't had an update since you got online or their updates just don't make their way to you.
That's why I described it the way I did, because that's how it's designed.  It's a good design, because it means it stays decentralized and asynchronous, but one drawback is no one has a perfect picture of the network.

Well, the first layer would still be an incentive-based, decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin.  But forcing a micropayment system into also being a micropayment + decentralizedID system sounds like, at best, feature creep and at worst, increased surface area for attackers and unnecessary complexity.
They can coexist beside each other just fine.
Edit: actually I understood the above comment to mean MS was trying to build this into the Lightning Network, which is a bad idea. But building it on top of, like you suggest, isn't such a bad idea so long as the increased distance from the settlement layer doesn't present security risks.
I still think this being layer 2 wouldn't be that detrimental to performance, if properly architected.

Depends on the attack.  If it's FUD, Bitcoin hunkers down for the winter and waits till spring because so long as the value isn't 0, the network is useful.
If it's government bullying, devs flock to countries that aren't backward facing and continue development.  Japan, South Korea and Switzerland all seem to be welcoming to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, recognizing their value.
If it's a hostile takeover, the dev community splinters and the overall community ends up flocking back to the largest and most technically proficient community that still serves the primary interest of Bitcoin.
Only if its supplanted by a better technology do I really believe it will even truly die.  It may go underground, it may hibernate, it may be banned, censored, and attacked through every avenue but so long as two people want to transact with it, it will survive.

Just off the top of my head, if you could find a way to compile the contracts down to run on the Ethereum blockchain, or create your own that allows for the full (or limited) python functionality, and then run Lightning nodes that atomically swap your tokens for Bitcoin at a specified rate, then congratulations: You now have distributed smart contracts written in Python that are backed by Bitcoin.

I'm of the opinion sysadmin-types* should run full nodes, and normal users should run pruning nodes. Relaying valid transactions is an important  function and even if you're running a pruning node, your SPV wallet can still point to your node and help improve your own privacy.
List of people who fall under sysadmin-types:
* Every bitcoin company should run multiple full node(s), both internally and externally facing
* Everyone with a homelab
* Everyone with a media server
* Everyone with a NAS
* Everyone who's comfortable paying for and configuring a server in the cloud somewhere*
Everyone else, at the very least, could set up a pruning node on their desktop computer and open 8333 in their router.  Other options include using an old PC, a raspberry pi, an old cell phone, a PC-on-a-stick, or even running on a sufficiently-powered router (although sync times are going to *suck*)
\*There have been many discussions about the benefits of running a full node in someone else's cloud, and while it's absolutely correct to say that it's not the best situation for bitcoin, especially regarding decentralization, it's still better than not running one at all†
†Assuming the cloud platform you're using doesn't snoop on all of its customers running bitcoin nodes which, let's be honest, is a real possibility; however I still think that the more honest users running bitcoin nodes, even in "the cloud", the better.

I had been meaning to for a while so I actually dug into the code, since the secret's always in the sauce and of course, I found nothing to alarm me.  We probably never will.  That's not the point.
This design choice is like giving administrator access to Samourai.  Sure, it can probably be trusted with it, and of course we can all inspect the source.  But it's not necessary and it's dangerous, especially over time.
After combing through the source a bit (though admittedly, I am not a Java developer), I can imagine why they did it this way: because it was easy.  The JSON-RPC is easy to interface with; if the Samourai devs wanted to do it "the right way", they'd need to implement actual node communication _and stay current with it_.  That's a lot of work.  I get it.  But it's the right design choice.  It's made easier by using `bitcoinj`, like Bitcoin Wallet does.  Samourai cannot in good conscience call itself a privacy-oriented wallet with **this** level of carelessness or cluelessness about things like the difference between RPCs and Bitcoin node communication.

Every additional full, validating node is another vote for the rules of the network.  When a miner wants to, say, spend coins that they don't have the private keys to, full validating nodes are the thing stopping them.
Miners are forced to follow consensus rules because they don't dare find a block, do something against consensus rules (such as including unsigned transactions, or mining blocks bigger than the block limit most nodes set), transmit it and have it declared invalid.

[Here's a video of roasbeef talking about the future routing in Lightning](  The routing tables are built on the sending side, and the payments are onion-layered so each path in the route only knows on what channel the payment to forward was received and on which channel to forward it.
per [the RFCs]( 


Further there are multiple ways of deciding how to route packets which are compatible with the spec.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:55:48
Yes, this. 
**Imagine you're a bad actor and you want to trace Bitcoin transactions to IPs of users**
All you really need to do is spin up enough nodes to count as a certain percentage of the network (I don't know mathematically what percentage is required for reliable fingerprinting so let's just pick 10%). If you control 10% of the nodes when, say, a light client connects to a handful of nodes to broadcast a transaction, with you controlling 10% of them, there's a good chance they'll connect to more than one of yours. In this way, you can associate Bitcoin transactions with user IPs.
**What dandelion does** is create a chain (kind of like onion routing, now that I think about it) that hides the original source IP, since when you get broadcasted transactions it will kind of flood from everywhere, with honest nodes helping. You can still track transactions but not nearly as reliably, and it will raise the cost threshold of fingerprinting Bitcoin transactions.
**In summary**
*Before dandelion*: Light client users connect to a bunch of nodes to broadcast their transactions.  If someone happens to control more than one of the nodes a user connects to, that someone can associate the transaction with the light client's IP.
*After dandelion*: A light client user connects to one random node and gives it the transaction.  Then it sends the transaction directly to another node, who then does the same (without broadcasting it en masse to the network yet).  Then after a little bit of time (milliseconds), all the nodes that have the transaction broadcast it at once to the nodes they are connected to.
*Mitigation you can do right now*: Run an honest node and only broadcast transactions from that.  It's not as private as Dandelion, but from a bad actor's perspective, they'll need a much clearer picture of the whole network to guess which node was the source of a transaction (and if you're geographically separated from your node when you make your transaction, they are unaware)
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:19:23

Every "explorer" is really just a view into the network from the perspective of one node.  As you get further out from any given node, its view of the network gets "foggier".  All nodes really need to care about when routing payments is their immediate and medium-distance channels, and finding a path that works when sending a payment.
So every visualization of "the network" is really a visualization of a specific node's view of the network, which will almost definitely be incomplete.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:42:43
The analogy isn't perfect, and when considering it you should consider Bitcoin as self-contained.  But in the case of outside attack, the network, so long as it doesn't commit suicide, will band together to fend off the attack and keep their value.

There's no reason why you need to expose the RPC port to anything in order to allow the full functionality of the Bitcoin network, Samourai included.  Why does Samourai need to control your node?  I have asked the devs and never got a straight answer which means:

* they need that access for nefarious reasons.

But somehow it sits easier with me knowing it's more likely that someone who holds more than 1BTC understood the Earth shattering consequences before everyone else, and thus is sort of justified in being rich, rather than one of their ancestors had a hand in conquering the Turks at one point.

* Hang around Bitcoin watering holes and learn, and teach others.
* Make your node accessible from Tor, to help other's privacy.
* Use your node for your transactions! If you have [this wallet]( it's as easy as going to settings, and then entering your node's IP (or DNS) in "Trusted Peer".  This ensures you cannot be lied to about the state of the network and increases your own privacy!
I put so much emphasis on learning and teaching because while Bitcoin truly is revolutionary, if you don't know why, or you've never heard of it, it's like it never existed in the first place.

I think the "room full of people" might be my analogy I posted the other day on the LND Slack so lets stretch it some!
Imagine you want to pay someone on the other side.  Of course, you can talk to them but you can't move about (making channels, in Lightning terminology).  What do you do?
**You**: "Who do you see?"
**Them**: "I see Bill, Jim, Jerry, Vanessa, Lance"
**You**: "Ah, stop there, I know Lance.  I'm close enough to pass a message to Alice, who can pass it to Bob, who can reach Lance."
**Them**: "Great, then the rest of the path should be from Lance to Mark, then Craig, then me!"
You: "Awesome".
That's _one_ (**but not the only**) way of figuring out routing through the network, and the method I believe is employed now.  Every implementation can choose how they want to figure out routes, from trying to keep a whole picture of the network (unrealistic and difficult to scale) to the method I described (I believe it's called something like Beacon routing since in this case, Lance acted as a beacon for both parties to figure out a path).

If your ideas aren't well formed, if your code isn't up to snuff, if your proposals have flaws, then they'll be shown as such and I don't think a single true believer in Bitcoin is against raising the blocksize if it is the **only** scaling solution.

The accusations you throw at the Bitcoin community are precisely the activities in which you are engaging.  BCash is not a meritocracy.  There was no merit to begin with.  BCash is not decentralized--it's closed fucking source! [Errors posted in the tracker don't correspond with anything in the purported source code](
BCash is the exact opposite of everything Bitcoin stands for, disguised as an attempt at "more decentralization" and "better scaling".

The [slides]( Greg showed serve as a good TL;DW, but some interesting less obvious highlights (to me, as a semi-technical user):
In 0.15:
* **Improved fee estimator** and fee handling (looks back up to one week to estimate fees, "economical" and "conservative" modes) (LOOKING AT YOU COINBASE)
* Multiwallet support (RPC only for now)
* OpenSSL is almost completely gone from the code (still used in PRNG and HTTPS support)*
Coming Soon(tm):
* Dandelion (basically, a transaction hops from one node to another for a number of hops, then all nodes transmit the transaction at once)
\* The fact the devs even care to remove OpenSSL was initially surprising but (as Greg explains in the video), makes a **lot** of sense, because generally you don't want to rely on external libraries for consensus-related code, plus OpenSSL (while widely deployed and audited) has a large surface area (and larger than necessary for Bitcoin's purposes).
I didn't expect to watch a 95 minute long technical presentation on a software I don't develop for, but it was actually very interesting to me.

If there's a 51% attack, that makes Bitcoin _not Bitcoin_, it makes it owned by whoever controls the 51% of the hashing power.  The other 49%, **and crucially**, all of the users who don't want JihanCoin or whatever, will _simply change the Proof of Work scheme_.  They have an existential crisis, and SHA256 doesn't _define_ Bitcoin.  So there would be a pretty crazy time of things shifting around, but scrypt works fine for Proof of Work.  There are a lot of algos that work fine for that.  Hell, we could use the mainstream flavor of SHA256 rather than Bitcoin's current chosen flavor and let the (_assumed_) cracking power of the government security agencies mine if we wanted to.  A crypto mined by all of the governments of the world sounds like a crypto no government can control singlehandedly.  It still means governments can collude against the people, but they'd all have to agree to do so.  Not that this would be anyone's first choice, of course.
Point is, anyone with 51% of the hashing power has to consider the choices the users, devs, and other miners make.  If 51% of the mining power has gone rogue, the community will likely change the PoW scheme and yeah, I may mine.  I know I'm honest and committed to the future of Bitcoin.
edit: read the link posted below.  My thinking is slightly flawed along these lines, and while we don't know how the market will react in a 51% attack, but suffice to say, the scenario I describe might not "save" Bitcoin.

I think Bitcoin mining broadly mirrors some of the same game theory that prevents global nuclear annihilation.  That is, so long as no one wishes to commit suicide, the equilibrium continues.
Nuclear armed countries have a very rational decision to make: do they want to kill everyone or no one? Because every model including thermonuclear warfare usually escalates out of control, and retribution is virtually guaranteed.
Same thing with Bitcoin mining.  Miners can collude and attack the network, but the network's real-world value is built on faith of the network's real-world utility.  No decentralized participant wants to be on ChinaCoin, or USCoin.  They want Bitcoin.  Destroying Bitcoin's integrity is committing suicide.  Every miner is aware that if the value of Bitcoin is zero, the value of their gear is zero.  That doesn't mean they can't exit the market and cause commotion, but it takes the entirety of the hashpower to decide to stop mining in order for Bitcoin to truly die; if even 1% of the hashpower decides to keep mining, then I imagine the network will decide to "reset" its hashpower to get blocks flowing again and now the honest 1% is mining 100% of the blocks.  The price of Bitcoin would surely plummet but the network would remain useful and usable, and the properties of a depreciating asset are such that as time goes on, its value will _always_ increase.  So that honest 1% just has to wait long enough and no matter their investment, they will recoup it.  Granted, they may have to wait hundreds of years.
So, long and short, this is something I've been saying for a long time.  So long as the value of Bitcoin isn't 0 (that is to say, the entire network has lost all of its utility), it's price will continue to rise on a long enough timescale.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:37:30
Yep, that's correct. If a majority (or even a minority) of miners decide on going one way or another, the chain forks. And the "honest chain" takes a hit. But which chain you're on is determined by which consensus rules you follow. And the consensus rules are determined by what node you run, or if you don't run a node, what nodes you connect to.

Yes it is, thank you for responding.  There's a wide spectrum of people in the Bitcoin space, from crypto-anarchists to hedge fund managers playing around with spare cash.
As Bitcoin users, we decide the level of involvement and investment we take, and there's no wrong answer.  But I also think the more you learn about Bitcoin, the more you see it less as an investment vehicle and more as a revolutionary technology that will continue to massively change our lives.  So it's refreshing to get a perspective from someone who, no offense intended, isn't a "true believer".  You were and are still part of this new and exciting system, and it's important to always remember that your usage of Bitcoin is no less valid than mine.

I watched your presentation linked elsewhere in the thread and if possible I'd like to clarify something as a layman.
I understand the [allowed character set]( is optimized to make errors more detectable by arranging the map so visually similar characters produce easier-to-detect errors (which, up to 4(+1?) errors detected is impressive on its own) but I can't help but notice the choice of the character set seems to have a lot of similar-looking characters.
If you selected more distinct looking characters for this set, would you lose error detecting capabilities? In other words, are the lookalike characters necessary to anticipating and detecting human copy errors?
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:21:46
It would be possible but real-world use would require trust outside of bitcoin.
Say, for example, both you and VISA are known to the blockchain by public key (for example, you both are the first to "register" your twitter handles by creating bitcoin transactions that reference them, then publicly confirm the transactions via a tweet).  In this example, let's say VISA is  you are  your public key is 1You, and VISA is 1VISA.
You and VISA create a "transaction" which in essence is just a message, whether it's a transaction ID, details of the transaction, etc.  Lets say the message is
``` paid  $10```
You sign the message
``` paid  $10```[SIGNED BY 1You]
You send it to VISA and they sign it
``` paid  $10```[SIGNED BY 1You AND 1VISA]
You then include this data somehow in the bitcoin blockchain.  At this point, we have some facts about the transaction that are irrefutable, and some facts about the transaction that are implied **and require external trust**.
**Irrefutable facts that bitcoin proves:**


As you can see, this does not make it a fact that you paid VISA.  Nor does it make it a fact that  paid   Nor does it make it a fact that 1You paid 1VISA.  The only fact is that both private keys associated with 1You and 1VISA signed a message with the contents ``` paid  $10```.  Tweets can be edited, and your initial "proof of ownership" tweet could be deleted or changed.  Your key could get lost or compromised over time, which bitcoin does not care to know about, it does not make assertions about **ownership** of keys, just about whether the key is **valid** for the associated message/signature.  A compromised key still signs valid transactions and messages.
In short, bitcoin is generally not good for proof of events that happen outside of bitcoin.
However, there is one thing bitcoin _is_ good for, and that's proof of existence.  Say you have a document (lets say a short story) and you want to prove you owned the first copy.  You could checksum the document, and publish the checksum to the blockchain.  Then, at a later date, should forgeries arise, you can point to your transaction as proof that you owned the document first.  This is useful in copyright, patent, data ownership, data origination, and document integrity scenarios.  [This site]( helpfully provides a service that can write a checksum of your document to the blockchain for the purposes mentioned above.

I reviewed every line of [this commit]( specifically which is what's in master at the time of writing.
I have no major security concerns either with the script itself or the resulting installation. I do have a couple of minor nitpicks.
Minor nitpicks.
1. Using bitcoind as a backend *right now* is not the optimal configuration  (LND is designed to work best with btcd. Both backends work equally as well, but in this very early stage of development, focus is on btcd compatibility). For the record, I've used both with LND with no issue at all.
2. The script doesnt daemonize LND, which would be nice. Running it in tmux is still decently above bare minimum.
3. The script should probably disable the wallet on bitcoind via the config options. No funds would be stored there anyway, and it could prevent someone from getting confused and trying.
Overall, I'd be comfortable sharing this script with mildly technical people to help get them going.
I still *strongly implore everyone run testnet first if only so you can learn and train on it*.
Credentials: one of the first 100 mainnet nodes and I am a sysadmin with 6 years experience and 10 years experience with bash scripts. Only command I was not immediately familiar with was `logname` which is just because it's relatively old-school (I'm spoiled by `whoami` and the already existing $USER variable in bash, but you can't always count on those.)

It's important to remember that there are still **a lot** of things that can make the value 0.  If a better technology supersedes it* (along with the same size or larger dev community for continued support), if elliptic curves are broken (though this means as a whole, most cryptography is broken and we'll have _other_ problems), and a number of other things _could make this whole experiment fail_.
\*Some might say that technologies like Ethereum, Monero, et al supercede Bitcoin and thus, Bitcoin's on the way out.  One day, this may be true but the true innovation in the space continues to revolve around Bitcoin.  I mean, compare the mailing lists and you'll see what I mean; groundbreaking innovations continue to be introduced and discussed on the mailing list that altcoins can just copy.  That's not to say other altcoins aren't useful, just that as a durable store of value with a limited selection of programmatic functions, Bitcoin is *destroying* every other coin in the space.
Andreas puts it this way (paraphrasing): Bitcoin is Lego with standard pieces, not a whole lot of flexibility, not a whole lot of diversity in base pieces but you can still build [complex]( interesting, useful creations using it that are tied together using very simple rules.  Extending that, I say Ethereum, for example, is more like creating an art sculpture out of many different materials.    It can be exactly how you want it, but that doesn't mean it'll be durable, it doesn't mean it'll be inter-operable and there may be sharp edges.  Some [very sharp](  That doesn't mean Ethereum is useless, just that Bitcoin and Ethereum do not directly compete on every front, and thus one cannot shove another out of the space.

# Bad developers en masse
Many people say banks or governments, but alternate currencies and illegal activities have been occurring ever since the first currencies and the first laws.  I'm not that concerned because each impediment can be solved with proper application of decentralization and anonymization.
 However
It's the hardest thing in the world to come up with a flawed idea _and not execute on it_.  Many will propose bad ideas for Bitcoin and unless the influential majority can articulate why it's a bad idea, we'll end up with a **fundamentally flawed** cryptocurrency.
The reason I think this is so likely is it's incredibly hard, even for highly technical people, to make an informed decision on whether a proposal is inherently flawed. That problem is multiplied by every individual actor on the network. One example that comes to mind is the scaling debate; I know at one point it did occur to me "what's so bad about just increasing the blocksize anyway? Moore's law, right?".  It took reading arguments for and against from technical people, **and knowing which arguments were flawed** to land on the correct side.
We're extremely fortunate for the current technical landscape of Bitcoin - by and large the people writing the code and standard are competent, thoughtful, careful, forward-thinking experts and I'm extremely thankful for that.  But literally anyone can propose a change to Bitcoin, and it takes one of those people to stop it from becoming reality - hell it could become reality on the network anyway even if the idea was dismissed if people decide to just run that code anyway.  Things like bolting on centralized services that "complement" Bitcoin.  They could be very useful, and many people would run it because they wouldn't see the harm, but it would be a giant stumbling block in Bitcoin's true path.  One example is exchanges: they really should have been decentralized from the beginning but it was easier to just centralize them, and now we have KYC, AML, hacks etc.  Every time we take a shortcut or implement a flawed proposal, it delays the ultimately correct solution from happening.

If you plan on having more than about $100 worth of Bitcoin, I recommend a Trezor or Ledger.  That's where you should put most of your funds for safe keeping.
After that, smartphones are pretty decent, I like [Bitcoin Wallet]( as it's pretty simple and easy to use, plus if you run your own node you can point your wallet at it for maximum privacy.  Best to keep less than $100 on that in case of loss or your phone getting hacked.

It's rounded down for now, but it's not a stretch to have some way to have the daemons trustlessly decide who gets the whole satoshi.

Credit Card? Not natively, but if you're comfortable with being a custodian of someone elses funds (and thus needing to comply with KYC/AML) then sure.

Either way what I'm getting at is it's theoretically possible that a channel expands over time.
Take Alice and Bob with 1BTC each into a channel:
      1        1
    Alice &lt;-&gt; Bob
Alice can theoretically put another 1BTC _later_ into the channel if she wishes, and then the total channel capacity would increase to 3 _without closing the channel and reopening it_.  That's what I'm getting at--the initial channel capacity won't be permanent forever.
Another example would be that Alice can open a 100k sat channel to someone, pay out basically all of those 100k satoshis, then **top-up** that channel with a single on-chain transaction and then continue to use the channel to make payments.

Large payments will get there when they get there but LN excels at micropayments. For example, if you're buying something to be shipped to your house, do you care that the tx to the merchant took 10 minutes or an hour to confirm? The merchant will ship the item an hour later but the base Bitcoin chain isn't the bottleneck here.
What this _does_ enable is instant payment for digital goods. Steam could accept LN payments for games and microtransactions that settle near instantly, as an example.

It remains to be seen what the network will support.  There's nothing stopping you from opening a 1BTC channel and using it 100 times for your grocery trips.  In fact, this might be exactly what happens with some people.
But Lightning excels at micropayments, and things that require instant transfer of value.
If Bitcoin is an unstoppable, but rather slow train, Lightning is a bunch of fast drones.  You can construct a giant drone, if you want, but then you're nearing territory better suited to trains anyway.

Since you mentioned it, I agree: this isn't a great option. I might not even enable it for mainnet for a number of reasons, one if them being precisely what you mentioned.
However, I'm trying to reduce the on-ramp and foster additional innovation and WordPress and WooCommerce are inarguably dominant. Further, the architecture is such that WordPress can pretty much only request invoices and know when they're paid.
In the grand scheme of things, I think giving people experience with Lightning through stuff like this will help foster adoption and give people a test bed for learning and development.
But also, since you mentioned it, can you recommend a simple online store platform that's got a good security track record, is open source, and is extensible? I will begin work on a similar tool with what you suggest and maybe it'll turn out better.

In all seriousness, I'm of the opinion if you're gonna use Lightning, you should do testnet first, and that's what this is for.
For more tech-savvy users, hopefully this becomes an easy way to get testnet testing/learning out of the way, and maybe one day there'll be an easy-to-use, mainnet-capable package that abstracts away a lot of the "developer-y" stuff like building packages.

There's more than that, every public ~~explorer~~ visualizer is underestimating.  For instance, literally every channel opened with the mobile Eclair wallet is not counted.

I was a little snarky but I appreciate the answer.
So, to be clear, you're saying that no miners will be un-upgraded, so thus the "legacy" fork will just stop?
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:20:04
Nah, Fully validating nodes run the coin, miners produce blocks that agree with consensus.
Ex: If miners _decide_ to produce 16MB blocks, nodes who run with settings below that won't accept their blocks.  Full nodes have the power.  Miners are beholden to what the users want and what the users want is determined by what code they run and which settings.  At least that's how it is on Bitcoin.
If miners all decide they don't wanna go along with it, then the difficulty will freefall and full node operators will dust off their 2 generations old ASICs and pick the coin back up.  Remember, Bitcoin worked fine when it was just normal CPUs mining.  If miners want Bitcoin, they have to mine the chain with the most consensus.  Miners can make whatever other coins they want, and that's likely what happened with Bitcoin Cash - for miners, developed by the miners, run by the miners, forked off because miners wanted their own consensus.  And that's fine by me, MinerCoin is still relatively useful as a store of value and method of transfer, but the sphere of consensus (number of people making decisions about what the coin is) is dozens of people wide, rather than worldwide.

This is very much a work in progress, but the linked GitHub repo will allow you to quickly spin up:
- WordPress
- WooCommerce+[WooCommerce Lightning Gateway](
- LND
- [lncli-web]( for administering LND
This is testnet only, and it will require downloading the full Testnet blockchain before it works (1.2 million+ blocks) so it's not instantly usable.
It only requires [Docker]( and [Docker-Compose](
I highly recommend a solid understanding of Lightning, and a passing familiarity with `lnd`.

Yes, but if a node charges too much (like for example more than the current miner fee), it's cheaper to just open a channel to the destination and then your micropayments are free.

I actually agree, I was very hesitant to post (and still am), but I thought it worth pointing out the real story here.
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:33:44
Okay, lets decide who has the power on Bitcoin by asking a simple question:


The miners, or the fully validating nodes?
Lets take this further.


I mean no offense, but I don't respect your credentials in "blockchain development" if you don't understand where the rules are enforced on a blockchain.

The main compose file requires the whole blockchain.
I'm working on the [neutrino version]( but I can't test it at the moment.  Neutrino only works on testnet right now anyway.
For mainnet until things mature quite a bit, you really want your own copy of the blockchain to be sure you're not being lied to about the chain state, or information is being withheld.
A full node isn't a requirement to use Lightning, but things are still very early and to get the strongest guarantees you should run your own node.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:46:59
hmm, technically not true.
it's possible to top up funds in a channel by making an on-chain transaction to it.  Right now, that's not implemented in any daemon I know of, but it's definitely possible.
0 fund channels are still useless, so one side needs at least a little funds for the channel open.

The ideal HODLer wouldn't sell even as Bitcoin plummeted to zero, but the ideal HODLer doesn't exist.  We're all people with different financial situations, and some are in situations where the compelling financial reasons to sell outweigh the ideological reasons to HODL.  I can't fault anyone for wanting what's best for them and their family.
What I wrote isn't law, it's what I try to follow; *try* being the key word.  Yes, I've sold before, and I will likely do so again soon.  But my hope is a world where I am paid in Bitcoin, and I spend Bitcoin everywhere.  Not because I already have some Bitcoin, but because the technology is demonstrably superior and more fair than the system we have today.

if ~$2,000 USD is "going down with the ship", then maybe you've not sailed these seas very long.

HODL to spend, never to sell.

I think it's disingenuous to say someone is "taking Bitcoin" when someone armed with any standard Bitcoin wallet cannot transact with them.  It's also disingenuous to say that you're paying them when in fact it's Spedn that's paying them from a custodial account they have for you.
I think it would be most accurate to say "Custodial payment processor now allows you to transact with major retailers using your account denominated in Bitcoin"
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:52:47
Yeah, only keep on an exchange what you're currently trading and are willing to lose. Exchanges should only have your bitcoin while you're converting it, no matter how much they say you can trust them. Learn from MtGox.

A wallet app on your smartphone is better than Coinbase. Breadwallet or Bitcoin Wallet would be a good start. Make backups of your keys, encrypted, and not saved to cloud storage providers.

If you're talking about credit cards, that's false.  Visa/MC pay the merchant and deduct the amount from an agreed upon credit account.  You don't pay for it until you go to pay your bill.
If you're talking about debit accounts, then Visa/MC pay the merchant and the amount is deducted from your custodial checking account where you've given them your money with the promise that when you try to spend it they'll let you do so.
This is very similar to the second scenario, just the account is denominated in Bitcoin.
Maybe you can also send to Bitcoin addresses natively as well as paying merchants through their payment processor, in which case this is just a custodial wallet with strong merchant partnerships.

So long as the value of Bitcoin isn't 0 (i.e. the technology was made worthless by a bug, exploit or better tech), the value will always rise according to inflationary currencies over a long enough period of time.  This is inevitable due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin, the inflationary nature of other currencies and the fact that one dollar of Bitcoin is more useful than a dollar of any other currency.
So no matter what, it's cheap today compared to what it will be in the future.
_*(we all know that the market fluctuates, but when you zoom out, the trend will always be upward)_

That comic was apparently created [Feb 3, 2009](  The price of Bitcoin back then was [basically worthless]( but we do have the Bitcoin Pizza in 2010 to go by, so lets run with that.  The exchange on that transaction was 500 Bitcoin per dollar.  Which means that if you had spent $5 worth of Bitcoin when the comic was made, you could have purchased 2500 (or more) Bitcoin.
Putting it all together, if you had bought $5 of Bitcoin when that comic was released, you would have ...
 dollars worth of Bitcoin
So, yes, you could feasibly buy any wrench on the planet.

Bitcoin is not just a currency, but a standard and the phrase "Accepting Bitcoin" assumes you are compatible with the standard.  Also, PayPal is a **great** example to compare to because they're **not directly compatible with dollars**.  If a street vendor accepts US Dollars and you say "Here, let me PayPal you" they'll likely look at you like you're trying to pull off a scam.  PayPal is not dollar compatible.  It's denominated in dollars, but it's only compatible with PayPal (and retailers who accept it).

I wonder if he'd feel the same way if people treated his physical security like he treats other people's cybersecurity... "_you should have moved into a bunker if you didn't want us to break in!_"
That's a warped rationalization to somehow blame the victim for his crime.

Surprised to see this so far down the list.  In the last couple weeks I've bought a game for a friend in Europe and a friend in Texas with bitcoin and it was a breeze.  No need to be friends beforehand, no need to worry about exchange rates, no need to worry about region-locking.  They send me the invoice, I pay it.

The bitcoin network is always "up-to-date", so were you to sign a valid transaction (i.e. not overspend the amount in the addresses), the network would accept it and the balance in the appropriate accounts would continue to be valid on the blockchain, however bitcoin-qt would not show the correct balance until it got caught up.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the client prevented you from spending until it got caught up just to prevent you from trying to send invalid transactions.
To prevent this, you could use a [web wallet]( (which has a backend that it checks balances through that runs a full blockchain) or a lite client such as [MultiBit](  They don't keep a copy of the blockchain on your computer, they act as clients to a server running the full blockchain.
If you're absolutely bent on selling the bitcoins ASAP, I'd suggest importing your private keys into multibit to spend them.  [Here is the guide I used]( that didn't require sending the private keys to blockchain.info.
