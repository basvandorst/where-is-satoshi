Other than just buying cheap and hodling what are some other things we could be taking advantage of?

Why would i need to know enough about lightning for it to be responsible to tell you how to create a node/channels. Like I said I am trying to invest in this future I know is going to happen, I know the basics but I don't know the code obviously. I can buy bitcoin without knowing how to write a smart contract. I asked how to invest in lightning, not how to create a fucking node. 
Hey can I buy some ice cream? You are literal years away from understanding the chemistry of what goes into making ice cream *pushes up glasses*.

How do you sign power of attorney? If she just went to a bank it wouldn't work she needs this power of attorney thing? Do I have to go to a lawyer to get it done?

I would give anything in the world for the price to be 4800 in 3 weeks, is there a reason you think that?

You just blew my mind and I never though of it that way. I always just think if it goes to 100k each, and i only bought 2.5 and will regret not having 3 or something like that, just at the top the tiny difference a bit of saving and deal hunting could have been would be so much more at the end, but yes if it all goes to 0 none of it matters lol

Do you think that it is temporary and will go back down or continute to go up?

But if you flip a coin you know there is a higher chance that it will land one of the sides of the coin rather then the edge. Just because you can't literally know the future does not mean that it is totally up in the air, you can use predictions and logic and graphs to recognize patterns. For example I will bet you 10,000 dollars that bitcoin hits 7000 before it hits 0. Now I am not a fortune teller but I know you will say no, I know I would almost always win my bet and I know that it will happen. Even if I do not literally know the future you can use a bit of common sense and history to predict the future, that is the entire point of this sub :)

My plan was to reopen my old bank of america account that closed due to the monthly charge and lack of funds, do you think it would be easier or harder for her to go to bank of america and try to reopen the old closed account? Appreciate the help.

How do you invest in lightning? I googled and found lightning bitcoin (LBTC) but it doesn't seem right.
