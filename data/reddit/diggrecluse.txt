This, I lost 8 bitcoins to gambling. Still a good lesson learned, though.

You do make a sound case, although this doesn't explain everything in the article.
And if you are right, shouldn't the prosecutors be able to find evidence of these high level clients?

Because famous people's opinions matter more than us everyday sheeple. Get with the program.

Unfortunate but this is how you have to do things with bitcoin nowadays. Too many people trying to take advantage of people's generosity.

You sound exactly like me, except my dad thinks its a ponzi scheme. I was thinking about starting a Bitcoin club at university, but that sounds kinda lame.

Amazing answers to every question. And you can actually understand what he says even if you're totally clueless about technology and bitcoin. Can't believe I just watched 2 hours of people talking...
@_date: 2014-10-18 03:42:23
Agreed, I loved using their website because the UI was very nice. Even after they got hacked I still stuck with them. No idea what the point of this "upgrade" was....

Just ignore these guys and stop them giving money and attention.

Anytime I put a withdrawal address for an altcoin it doesn't save. Did you have to manually email them or something?
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:25:37
Hodl all day. I should really go move my BTC to a proper wallet, though.
@_date: 2015-11-09 23:10:06
Woohoo! Second thing I bought with bitcoin, and saved money too.
@_date: 2015-10-26 07:28:25
Feels unreal. I still remember buying in around November 2013 thinking of getting rich quick. Ended up losing a good portion of my tuition money. Still have a little bit in bitcoin but not as much as i used to - now it's all about believing in the technology. Buy low, sell never indeed.
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:32:28
Funny and true. Can't believe I fell into the altcoin hype of late 2013/ early 2014. Thankfully I didn't lose that much!
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:41:02
Bought at 450 in 2013, tried reselling high and buying low, lost all coins to gambling, bought in again at 500 in early 2014. Haven't touched the coins since then. Bitcoin has taught me patience and innovation over greed.

If you do your research there are plenty of trusted sites to get bitcoins. I believe you can get them almost instantly on btce for example. And most only take a few days. I was exactly like you until I spent a few days learning about btc.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:54:08
It's surreal how quickly attitudes are changing. First the government and the corporate world didn't give 2 shits about bitcoin. Then they started piling on the bullshit about it being dangerous and unsafe. Now with the Chinese developments and this latest Chase bank stuff they're going into full on attack mode. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:07:17
This is great, I'm just getting into bitcoins and this is my first wallet method. 
I just have a question - can I use the same computer to send bitcoins from a watch only wallet? So I will create a transaction file, disconnect the internet, load up the wallet from a usb drive, sign the file, remove the usb drive, and then turn the internet on again. Would this work?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:09:22
I spend most of my time in r/bitcoinmarkets these days. This subreddit has been having a bit too much silly content as of late, but it is still useful for news.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:56:12
This is kinda scary. I use BTC-E as well and have all my BTC on the exchange for day trading. Very glad I went with 2FA with google on my phone, I suppose it's still hackable but really difficult for a hacker to be able to get access to both my email/btc-e login AND my phone.
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:02:25
That's the super optimistic version. It can happen, but it relies on continued merchant integration and public interest.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:27:46
Nobody knows. Yes we can make logical assumptions, in this case that it will continue to rise, especially if the rumors from the US senate are true. But in the end that is all it is; assumptions, not certainties. Having said that, I would advise you to buy now instead of waiting.

Perfect example of how politicians use specific words to suit their needs. I swear to god, ever since 9/11 whenever you want to condemn something, just sprinkle some terrorism on it. And the sad part is a lot of people fall for it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:32:16
IMO it'll stay above 900 for a bit then rebound back at 1100.

Hold. Bitcoin drops and goes up all the time, and so far this month it's actually quite predictable. Major drops happen about once a week or two, more often if there is some kind of a related event. This time around it's the Chinese government announcement that is causing the current "mini-crash" to be more harsh and go on longer. But it's likely going to go back up again in the coming days as has been the trend so far. If anything you could buy more bitcoins. Of course I can't tell you the future but I've been looking at bitcoins a lot this month (I only started in October) and the trends are generally predictable.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:36:29
So far the US law enforcement representatives are talking about the dangers of cryptocurrencies due to criminals using them (with examples, most of which don't even include bitcoins but older digital currencies). 
Now the big question: are the existing US laws good enough to regulate digital currency?
so far they're saying yes, the existing laws are enough.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:57:59
The big question is good so far - the speakers don't think any additional laws are required to regulate cryptocurrency. They gave the example of being able to catch the owner of Silk Road (who used bitcoins) without any additional laws being needed.
edit: closing statements - they agree cryptocurrency does not currently pose any serious threats, but they have to "keep pace" with developments. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:03:57
I agree. The biggest barrier to BTC going mainstream right now, imo, is that it is still rather difficult/time-consuming to safely and quickly store/transfer/use your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:55:20
I use Satoshi as well and everything is very smooth and easy. There's only one potential problem. How do you withdraw cash to your bank account? The way I understand, at the moment the only way to do so is to email them.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:08:44
The real question is, is it primarily the Chinese causing this crash, or Western panic about the Chinese announcement?
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:51:32
How is this a problem? You can always use smaller pieces. IE if for some reason there was only 1 bitcoin in circulation, then people who owned 0.00000001 or something like that would have the current equivalent of one bitcoin. Similarly if bitcoin goes up in value, something like 0.005 would became as valuable as 1 bitcoin could be today.

I watched V for Vendetta 3 days ago. This is getting scary.

What the fuck LOL. This guy is such a scumbag.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:57:52
I thought he was just going to say there's going to be internet money, but the fact that he specifically said that you won't know where/who the money came from is brilliant.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:21:55
Precisely. This is why I cashed out half of my BTC to make sure I don't lose any money. Now I just sit back and watch without any worry.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:04:55
This is some great advertising. I tried it out and won 0.2 btc so far. The feeling of making essentially 180 dollars out of nothing. I can see why people become gamblers...
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:29:11
You'll be saying that about today (600$) when it costs 1000 in a week or something. It's NEVER TOO LATE
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:06:43
Is there any way to go after these people? This seems like exactly the kind of thing we may need government Security departments for.

Because he wanted to day trade bitcoins and get rich in a couple of days.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:22:40
This bullshit about criminals is so stupid. Even if bitcoins are used by criminals, this pales in comparison to the volumes of fiat money used by criminals. Not to mention the real criminals are the corporate fucks that nobody investigates because they have too much clout. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:22:35
Yeah dude. I just recently bought bitcoins for 410 per 1 and even today for 530/1. It's definitely still worth it. Just don't go too crazy and invest everything. Only invest as much as you're willing to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:16:22
It's kind of funny, I was reading threads here and other bitcoin subreddits and everyone was losing their minds and predicting a further downfall as far as $ 250. Meanwhile I thought it wouldn't dip below 900 and get back to 1100 by the end of today. Guess who was right? :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:16:28
I see what you mean and I had the same dilemma in my brain...How can so many people profit without someone losing?
 The way I see it, if Bitcoin starts to SERIOUSLY surge upwards, it will begin devaluing fiat currencies (mostly the USD). So in that sense the "losers" will be everyone (since we all use fiat currencies in our daily lives). But it wouldn't be a gigantic loss in value because it is spread over so many people, at least not until bitcoins *Possibly* become the  world currency. 
Wealth never appears out of thin air. It does however get redistributed.
