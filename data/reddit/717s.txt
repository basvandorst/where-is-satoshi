And since I shouldn’t buy stocks, what do you recommend I do if I wanted to profit off of this market.
Thanks again for taking the time to reply.

One more thing;
I should be buying BTC, not BCH, correct?

Thank you for this information.
I really appreciate it. 
I will now finally start buying bitcoin and will not worry about stocks.

The stock market is what really confused me. I thought I had to buy shares to get in on the game. 
But you’re right. I’m new here too. Thanks for the warm welcome.

I’m sure I’ll be able to understand fully on why I should stay away from bch in the future. I trust your expertise. 
Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. :)

Hahaha I’m still trying to understand how people are profiting from bitcoin.
I’m actually asking if I just buy bitcoin now, and the stocks go up... would I be able to cash out at that current price?
Let’s say hypothetically I buy 1 btc CAD and it’s 5,162.94 today. Then 3 months down the line 1btc is 20,000.
That would be my current balance also right? 
I guess I’m answering my own question but I want to be educated by some people who can give me answers.
Excuse my misunderstandings.
Thanks
