What have you done in your life that has made you think you know how to run it?

Babies don't have reddit. Anyway, yes, I don't want to change it. But I do want others who knows about economics to change it.
Btw, why do you get so offended? That's not the way to argue, no one learned you that? It is verg rude actually, do you want to be a rude person?
PS. My guess is you will reply with a offensive comment, let's see if this will be true. Or maybe you won't reply at all, you only know how to get offended and feel too proud to proof I'm right.

You avoid my question. Why did you assume I want to change it? You seem really smart and I want to know what made you think I want to change it.

Are you capable of making this same comment without using any offense against anyone? If not, stop commenting, people really don't take you serious.

Why not? The economic crisis isn't really a good thing for the well being of humans, so why stick to something that doesn't work? I'm not saying crypto will work, but it is at least a try. If we all sit behind our computers and flame on everything that is a different economic system like you do, we will never move forward.
