I think instead of laughing at people or calling them stupid to fall for this, there should be a better way to tackle this issue cause, people actually believe and send their btc to these scammers,
Seeing this address in a couple of hours, already has victims:
I feel like this affects people very new to crypto and will totally discourage them if they fall into this and will have negative feeling towards it, like someone can just scam your coins and there is nothing you can do about it.

this means someone signed up using your email address, hence they sent you an email to verify that it is actually you the owner that signed up, if you didn't then just ignore it.
