2FA enabled on Gmail and BTCe now. Live and learn I guess. I'm not usually the type to fall for these scams so I guess nobody is safe. Haha. Thanks everyone for the advice and kind words. I'll be back in the BTC community soon enough.

I think this is what I'll use! Thanks

There's really no way to tell. That's the ride that is the early stage of Bitcoin. I think more and more adoption will lead to price increase only because I don't see why adoption would lead to decrease. The *real* problem is people see Bitcoins in value of BTC/USD or other fiat. For BTC to be it's own currency it needs to be separated. But people do want to make a quick buck in the early stages. That's what got me on board, but now I see the potential other than just making money as an early investor.

Thank you! I meant to ask a better way in my post, but forgot. Haha. I didn't want to use gox so thanks for another option.

Well I'm glad to see you're making your own informed decision. Best of luck. And I agree, BTC makes a much better payment system than a currency. But I guess that all a currency is. Haha

The CEO said in the announcement article he didn't want anyone to beat him to it. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 05:17:29
I don't think it'll do much to the price. The person or persons who buy $28,000,000 worth of BTC are investing. They're Just going to end up sitting in someone's wallet just like they are now. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:15:48
Nope... fuck me.

They're using coinbase so I'd assume that's the rate. Odd they don't display it. Keep in mind it launched an hour ago.

I spent Bitcoins to shop at Target a week ago. Got a $25 Target gift card from Gyft and spent it. Today that amount of Bitcoins is more like $30 but I knew that going in. It's something we all realize. 
Talk to your boss about getting on Gyft?
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:17:45
I had them there because I was trading at the time. Think there's anything BTCe can do about it?
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:14:56
Most people already have. Coinbase for example ties BTC to you. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:28:26
Preferably face-to-face like a friend or family member. However, you can do it online if you have someone that you can trust not to take your BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:05:23
So can we agree to say BTC is as much of a pyramid as USD? Because USD is propped up by the fact that people are willing to prop it up. Same as BTC. That doesn't make it a pyramid.
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:03:17
Right, but in a pyramid you have to directly bring people into the pyramid or you gain nothing. With BTC anyone can buy a BTC and wait for the price to go up without moving a muscle.
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:51:52
Look. Bitcoin is complex but at its roots it is a means of transferring money. I still don't think it is a pyramid. If you do that's fine. Agree to disagree. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:08:04
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:56:40
I meant to edit that. Fixed now. I meant to say that the value of your BTC doesn't depend on how many people join after you have bought BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:34:23


Bitcoin is for sending money globally quickly and with few fees. It's not soley for people to profit off of. When the price of BTC stops rising is when it will stop being a means of profit and a means of trade.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:17:42
One thing I'm not sure anyone has mentioned is that the Bitcoin market is VERY volatile (and that's fine). Supply and demand is what drives value. Supply for Bitcoin is still going up *for now*. Eventually all the Bitcoins will be mined and supply will stop going up.
At this point demand will be the only variable driving Bitcoin's price.
At this point, I believe the price of a Bitcoin will skyrocket for a while then begin the slow road to market stabilization. After that point, Bitcoin will become an extremely stable market and VERY mainstream for online purchases.
Any online company unwilling to accept Bitcoin now is understandable. As much as I love Bitcoin, it is risky to accept a volatile "currency" when you're a business with bills to pay.
What makes it great is Bitcoin holders will set the price. Not a bank, not a government, but EVERY SINGLE LAST HOLDER of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:50:02
Well I guess what I meant was Bitcoin is not a pyramid because you are not gaining anything based off of other people joining *under you*. Sure if more people are trading/buying/selling BTC the price will go up, but it doesn't rely on new people coming into the market *under you*.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:04:42
&lt;----The guy in the video
Nice work! Keep it up! I'm glad you committed to 12 days already, good exposure! Try talking about Gyft next time! That opens up a whole new world of ways to spend BTC
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:25:28
Bitcoin is not a pyramid because you are not gaining anything based off of other people joining *through you* directly. In a pyramid, you are higher up than people you introduce into the pyramid. With Bitcoin, the only gain you make off of referrals is through (for example) Coinbase which offers $5 worth of BTC when you refer someone and they buy BTC. I referred my parents and got $5 free. If it were a pyramid, I would always have more BTC than my parents, which is not the case since they bought some of their own. As far as upper echelon concerns, I see none. The US gov has an assload of BTC from when they busted SilkRoad, but that's evidence and can't be touched. And yes, Bitcoin is very cyberpunk.
The misconception with BTC and pyramid schemes is the "get rich quick" mentality that a lot of overzealous users get early on. Sure getting in the game early (i.e. now) will be more profitable in the long run hopefully, but that success does not require you to recruit people to use bitcoins.

Thank you so much. I'm kind of frustrated with their customer support. You're the first solid feedback I've gotten in 3 hours. Appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:53:52
I'm not disagreeing with that. I'm saying that you don't have to have people join the market *through* you via a recruitment/referral process.
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:22:22


BTC doesn't depend soley on "new money". It makes up a lot of the market now, but once all the "new money" is gone the price will stablize, not bottom out.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:35:32
Just buy them like everyone else. If you don't like the payout rate then don't bother with those type websites.

"You don't have currency that just comes up as a fiat currency. You have to have something behind it." 
Sure, that may be true. But Bitcoin is the answer to a PROBLEM of fiat money no longer having a backing.

Don't want to give out my exact city, but population is ~215,000, located in the USA.
Would I use Bitcoins to watch a movie at the start of next year? I would have to say that depends on the market. I don't plan on using Bitcoins as a means of payment until the market is a little more stable.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:40:27
Here's a simplistic version for you, then. haha
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:18:41
Find someone you trust that has bitcoins and do the transaction manually.

In a pyramid scheme YOU have to get people into the scheme. In bitcoin, It doesnt matter who refers someone into the market, it only matters if the new person wants to buy BTC. If BTC was a pyramid you could only make a profit if you had people join the scheme through you. That's what makes it a "pyramid" because people are stacked until you get to the top where there is only one person raking in the profit. This is not the case with BTC.

Wow I never knew you could just buy a back-up assist rear view camera kit like this. After I get some Christmas cash I may grab one. Think you'll have a Christmas sale?
