The fund will charge 10% of gains for passively trying to match an index where all transaction costs will be passed onto the investors... this is a complete scam and should be illegal

Not an answer but I’d like to know too - getting annoyed with the £325 a week limit on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:27:33
Don’t get too hung up on the fact it’s dated in March. The price of the future should be exactly the same as bitcoin today (as there’s no interest rate) otherwise you could sell the future and buy bitcoin now. When it comes to March if bitcoin has gone up you will make money on the ‘physical’ bitcoin and lose money on the future, or vice versa. Futures don’t attempt to predict prices on a particular date they should just represent the cost of carrying the underlying from today until that date

Mine has been 325 since July with no option to increase it

Buy the rumour sell the fact. Also, buy the dip
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:38:53
In yield?

Not that surprising really, everyone been advised not to make any transactions until things settle down
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:30:38
No, and yes!

Sure I have some bitcoin as part of my portfolio - risk reward is excellent

If there’s no other fees, it’s not that different from what you’ll pay on Coinbase
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:08:09
Think it’s a usd amount
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:13:25
Plus I guess with NK tensions potentially putting pressure on the KRW it's a nice way to diversify

Coinbase app (for me at least) has best price £200 above market and a 4% fee for paying on debit card. You can’t really compare an atm to purchasing via bank transfer and using limit orders
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:09:41
Stop buy order - if price is at the order level or higher then buy 
Limit buy order - if price is as the order level or lower then buy
Stop sell order - if price is at the order level or lower then sell
Limit sell order - if price is at the order level or higher then sell

A suboptimal number of roads would be built because people get less private benefit than the total benefit provided by the road. Economics has done plenty work on this

Money launderers don't mind giving up 10% to have nice clean untraceable bitcoin for their ill gotten gains. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:19:21
Was looking at  - is that wrong?

Volatility likely to be higher than usual during this period. Would avoid trading either coin unless you have to or have a particularly strong view on either side 
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:07:12
But if you're short BTC on Aug 1st don't you automatically end up short BCC too? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:26:01
$ market cap of BTC + BCC after HF should be exactly the same as before so theoretically the prices should reflect this. Whether it happens in reality is another question
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:26:44
Ok thanks
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:52:22
I'm one of those greedy bastards 
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:07:22
It's not going down very much...
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:27:20
You don't have to redeem anything. You will automatically get BCC and can choose to sell on one of the exchanges that is supporting BCC if you so wish
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:52:41
Profit taking/buy the rumour sell the fact
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:55:46
Save 20%... by going back in time and buying this morning ��

'...free from volatile currency fluctuations'! Bitcoin is probably the most volatile currency in the world at the moment...
