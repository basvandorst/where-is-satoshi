I don't recommend it.  Even if you're only interested in BTC as a speculative asset, it might take off as a currency someday and you'll want to spend it.  At this point you won't be able to do that with Robinhood.  It is probably safer than keeping coins on an exchange.

You’re calculating the gain, not the profit margin. Profit is a term used more in business than investing. Sales - cost of sales = gross margin. Gross margin / sales = gross profit margin.  Profit is a percentage of sales while gain/loss is a percentage of basis.

I think you're thinking of day traders.  Those of us buying for the store of value, in hopes that the price will increase over the long term, are still speculative investors.
@_date: 2019-03-26 20:41:22
My plan is to at least hold on to 1 BTC (assuming you can get more than 1 BTC).  Decide how high you think BTC can rise at the peak of the next bull run.  I'm gonna say $100k.  When BTC hits certain milestones up to $100k I'm going to sell a certain percentage of my holdings over 1 BTC.  If it keeps rising higher, I might dip into that remaining 1 BTC a little bit at a time.
I think the important thing is to have a plan and stick to it (don't act on emotion).  I'm also not an all-in or all-out kind of guy.  Don't wait for $100k to pull everything out because it might turn back down at $99k.

My guess is that lump sum is better in a bull, and DCA is better in a bear.  BTC from inception has very much been a bull, so that's why lump sum has usually been better in the past.  I'd be interested to see the analysis if you split the chart up between bull markets and bear markets.

@_date: 2019-08-14 02:53:59
No, it’s not a technical term.  I think we are using it to mean locking in your value at a certain point. Like if your BTC is worth $100k and you sell all, then you have a stable $100k cash instead of something that’s going to swing wildly. I wouldn’t think too much about the term.
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:05:23
On first thought, it is risky to have half of your net worth in BTC.  But then you realize that if he started investing years ago, his actual investment is much less than half of his net worth.  The only reason it's half now is because BTC grew so much.

Both.  It's ordinary income when you get it--look at the price of BTC at the time you receive it.  That is your basis in the BTC.  Then if you sell later on, your capital gain or loss is the difference between your basis and what you sell it for.

Too many people looking at selling as an "all or nothing" thing.  Why not "tether up" at $100k (or a different amount), and sell the amount you have in excess of your target?  Like if it's at $100k and rises 10%, sell $10k.

I see it recommended all the time.  I don't use it because 1) I had trouble getting my account set up when I first got into crypto, and customer service never responded.  And 2) I believe they sell BTC with a spread, similar to if you buy from an ATM.  Meaning that the price you buy it for is higher than market price.
Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:38:52
BTC is the better store of value due to scarcity.  There can only ever be 21 million BTC, and I don't think ETH has a cap.  There are more millionaires in the world than BTC, so that if every millionaire wanted to own 1 BTC it couldn't happen.
I still think the Ethereum blockchain has huge potential and I still buy ETH, but I think BTC is still the best store of value out there.

I don't see why not, but as a capital asset (not subject to 1231) it would still be subject to capital loss limitation and carryover, just like if you owned it personally.
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:12:12
Report all losses, even in excess of $3k, because you can carry them forward. I recommend spending a couple of hours putting together a schedule of all of your trades and see where you stand.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:34:28
I think what's more important is to not put all of your money into crypto--put money in stocks, bonds, etc.  Putting all of your money into different coins is not diversifying IMO.  Alt coins are so reliant on the price of BTC, so you're not lowering your risk a whole lot by investing in alt coins.  
That said I do put 1/3 of my crypto investments into Ethereum just because I believe it has a bright future as well.

@_date: 2019-01-10 23:15:19
I understand the halving has raised prices in the past.  What I don't get is, if we know that this happens, wouldn't this increase be built into the price of Bitcoin today?  As a speculative asset, it seems like if you can reliably except an increase of value, that asset suddenly becomes more valuable.  Thus negating that future increase, and we're back to unpredictability.

FYI, you paid about a 100% fee on that $1 purchase.  On Coinbase you have to purchase at least $200 of BTC to get the lowest rate of around 1.5%.  But I strongly recommend using limit orders on Coinbase Pro to purchase BTC without a fee, and without a markup in price.  If you have Coinbase account, you already have a Coinbase Pro account.  I just learned how to do this yesterday and can help if you want.

It doesn't matter which one you keep the funds on; I would just transfer cash over to Pro when you want to purchase.  
Generally the first step is to Deposit cash from your bank to Coinbase.  That cash is available immediately.  The go into Coinbase Pro and on the left hand side, click Deposit, then choose USD, then Coinbase Wallet to transfer your cash from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro.
Then you are ready to buy.  Choose Limit instead of Market to get a fee free purchase.  If you want to use all of your money you transferred over, click Max under Amount.  Choose a limit price (usually something just under the current trading price).  When/if BTC hits that price, your purchase automatically takes place.  You can always cancel your order and place a new one.
Then if you want, you can transfer your BTC back to Coinbase since it has a slick interface.  Veterans recommend to get all of your money off of Coinbase an into your own wallet.  I'm not there yet since I don't have much skin in the game.

I don't know how much the house is, but I'd strongly recommend getting a mortgage and just putting down a 20% down payment or however much to get the lowest interest rate.  Interest rates are still fairly low, and you will win to inflation.  It's a bad time to sell BTC.

Depends on how long you've held the Bitcoin and how much taxable income you have.  If you held it for more than one year, most of us will pay 15% tax, but it could also be 0% or 20% depending on income levels.  If you held it for less than a year, it's taxed at ordinary rates (look up your income tax bracket).

You have to cash out or exchange it for another currency in order to realize your loss.  So you could cash it out then immediately buy back in since the wash sale rules don’t apply to crypto.

Buy now.  If it's a large sum you have, spread your investment out over several months.  Ideally you would want to invest roughly the same amount periodically.  But I would only invest after you have 6 months of expenses in cash and equivalents (not including bitcoin) and after you are investing enough in retirement accounts.
I invest once a month, but if I had more income I would invest more often.  However each time I invest, I set an alert to buy when the price drops 25%.  That's the only sort of timing I do.

Yes, I had a transfer this morning that was supposed to take a little over an hour, and it took around 5.

Good point.  There was a bill introduced last week that proposed a $600 de minimis exemption, so if passed you could buy items for under $600 free of capital gains tax.  However you would still need to track your basis for times when you do have a taxable event.
I don't know if there is any good software out there to help you track everything, but if not there's a good opportunity for developers.

Holy crap. The main reason I won’t spend Bitcoin is because I don’t want to have to refigure my basis every time I spend. This would be huge if it passes. We would actually be encouraged to use Bitcoin as currency instead of investment.

I don't know, I meant 25% from the last time I bought, so anytime within a month.

He says we'll have a sustained bear market until people start to forget about Bitcoin; then it will rise.  I'm okay with that.

Can someone remind me why an ETF would be good for Bitcoin?  I've seen people be optimistic about it.  Don't we want more people using Bitcoin, as opposed to just investing?

So a big sale at 20:00 caused BTC to drop, and a big purchase--at almost the same amount--just recently caused it to go back up?

Out of curiosity, where were there so many at the peak?  Just because Bitcoin was a hot news item at the time?

Was this chart created in 2016?

There are different types of value.  You're thinking intrinsic value, while everyone else is talking about market value.

Good, I’m hoping it stays low until after the next halving in 2020.
