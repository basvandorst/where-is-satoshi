Am I the only one who missed the word, "Pleads" and couldn't believe their eyes?
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:57:12
are there any stablecoins?

Okay I'm just a lurker in this subreddit but there's a lot of terrible answers here so I thought I'd speak up.  First the system that creates bitcoin is massively distributed.  You might also ask what happens when someone kills the one plant that makes all of our air.  As far as the code, one person cannot change it.  In fact it's very hard to change even id everyone wants to.  You have to actually copy the whole thing and make the changes on the copy.  This requires at least 51% of the users to agree.  (I believe this has happened at least once before) Bitcoin isn't a perfect system but it's lasted this long because it's pretty robust.

this looks like exactly what I was looking for, unfortunately I can't seem to use most of the site.  I hope they roll out more features to new users soon.  Thanks.

Mostly what I'm getting at is, having one person who owns all the hardware and keeps it all locally, but buys it with investors money and distributes bitcoins to the investors based on the shares that they own.
Edit: So yeah I guess it would still make sense in that scenario to mine in a pool, but it's still an alternative for the *investors* since they themselves are not part of a pool.

I've looked at GLBSE and I cannot make heads or tails of it

That is the single most epic description of BBT I've ever heard.  Next time I see my wife watching it, I'm gonna drop that one on her.

I'm having some trouble figuring out how Localtill is supposed to work.  Can I get a brief summary?

Nah, Satoshi is *clearly* John Titor.

I don't gamble anymore, but if I ever have enough money to do it again, I will likely do it at Bitzino.  I won 5 BTC over the course of several months (with 1-2 BTC stakes at any given time, sometimes as low as 0.128)  It's clearly not rigged.
Well technically it *is* rigged by virtual of being a roulette wheel (the payout is slightly less than the probability would indicate, but they aren't CHEATING)  
If OP would like to send me 10 BTC, I will gladly do the gambling for him and split the winnings.  (I've had a couple "big" loses - as high as 1.5 BTC but I've learned a lot since then)
@_date: 2013-03-10 06:43:23
that...is a much better idea, yes.  
though I do believe as the market matures, there will be institutions capable of providing all three, especially if the coins themselves are kept offline 99% of the time and notes are the typical unit of exchange.  Even then, a credit union would be the most likely type of organization for these institutions to take.  
I was using the term bank in a fairly naive way I suppose - not realizing the differences between banks and credit unions.

Interesting.  In about 2.5 weeks I'll be verified on Coinbase for instant purchases.  I'll have to look into that.

sorry if this is a dumb question but, what's TCF?
@_date: 2013-02-28 02:26:42
I see what you're saying, but it still functions as collateral to the borrowers.  Admittedly you have to be confident that the collateral will still have value by the time you get it, but that's true for any loan.  
I'm really starting to think BTCJam will become a decent place to throw some BTC around, unless there's something I'm not seeing (which is why I made this thread)
@_date: 2013-02-23 23:22:41
I know I'm really late in saying this, but this is *exactly* what I was looking for
@_date: 2013-06-01 23:49:38
I'll add to that.  I had a very good experience with them.  I even made a mistake on my order and correcting it was a breeze.  THAT'S saying something.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:26:46
Well you could always reinvest in bitcoin after making the $600 profit.  
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:36:29
Upvoted.  These legitimate businesses could make extensive use of bitcoin since banking is not an option.

Depending on how you look at it, SAT scores are not a robust metric for college success either (r=0.4 roughly) but it's the only game in town.  And yes, it can be manipulated, but only for short term bursts (which would tend to be expensive).  What I'm hoping for is to get a picture of what the market will look like when we start to approach the tps limit.  
My gut feeling is that the market will be so much larger than it is today that overcoming the tps barrier will be trivial, but I have no data to support this. (Hence the OP)
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:30:52
Isn't this subject to abuse? For instance couldn't someone create a hostile mixing service that ensured that every coin in circulation ended up on the red list?
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:00:03
So I take it you wouldn't be available to take a survey about your bitcoin transaction habits? (Not that I have said survey available right now.  But I may be putting one together over the next couple weeks)

What's the state of online purchases?

SatoshiDice looks like it has a nice dividend percentage.  
@_date: 2013-03-07 19:41:16
the existence of normal BTC use (upon which a BTC bank is *based*) will place market pressure on a BTC bank not to engage in the kinds of behaviors that corrupt modern banks do.  Ultimately a BTC bank will not be able to charge the kinds of fees modern banks charge because it will be too easy to people to switch back to BTC.  
They will provide the convenience of faster transactions, currency stability, and ease of adoption.  But they will never be too big to fail.

Forgive my ignorance, but I thought margin trading was investing borrowed money.  They actually have to own an asset before they can post it as collateral, though I suppose there's nothing stopping them from investing the borrowed money into even more of the said assets, which would be margin trading.  Or have I misunderstood the entire concept?
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:10:32
I don't see a reason to ask for *any* identifying information.  It wouldn't really add anything to the data.  I mean I guess some surveys *do* try to establish demographics, but in this case there's really nothing to be gained from that.  It's trading behavior that matters, not who's doing it.  (And I'll try to keep my questions ego-neutral while I'm at it)

I had a very good experience as well.  Hell I may be ordering again soon
@_date: 2013-03-22 10:34:36
The thing is, I'd like to get *more* bitcoins, and I have very little fiat to spare, so I was hoping to take the BTC I have and invest it to get more.  
I get that it's a gamble, but hell I've already made about half my BTC from bitzino.  Something with odds less obviously stacked against me would be nice.  (I'm especially looking for short term investments with dividends - I want to pull out in a month or two)
@_date: 2013-04-28 15:55:52
It sounds like to really do this, I need to survey of people's trading/transaction habits.  Calculating a demand index based on TPS and trade volumes could be very valuable.  I'm going to look into this.
@_date: 2013-03-22 10:40:20
It would be better if I had more BTC.  Which is why I'm looking to invest.  I *was* investing in loans at BTCJam, but I'm looking to get out of that market now.
@_date: 2013-08-19 13:26:24
I thought localbitcoins involved meeting people in a public place and either sending them bitcoins when they hand you the cash, or giving them cash for the bitcoins they send you?  If you're getting deposits from all over the world, wouldn't that involve having your own website/business?
@_date: 2013-03-22 10:41:40
Your missing the point.  I'm looking to remove the temptation to gamble on something that is obviously a losing strategy in the long run, by replacing it with a calculated risk.  
@_date: 2013-04-28 15:52:20
But the ratio of high transaction users and low transaction users should be calculable.  
Edit: Or rather, researchable
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:12:59
I'll keep you in mind, although dealing with an individual seems like it would involve a lot of negotiation of terms.  I want something with maximum ease of use.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:48:23
Seriously, everything you *can* buy with Bitcoin, you should.
