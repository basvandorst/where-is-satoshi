AFAIK, Circle does not hold dollars. When you buy bitcoins from them, they withdraw money from your bank account and give you the bitcoins when they receive the money from your bank (which takes a few days).
Later, you can sell the bitcoins back to Circle and they will deposit dollars in your bank account (which takes a few days).
Coinbase previously did they same thing but I believe that Coinbase will now hold dollars for you, too.

If the wallet is not encrypted, then anyone that accesses the wallet data or the backup can take your bitcoins.
If you use the encrypt feature in Bitcoin Core, the wallet will be encrypted. Then, if anyone gets a copy, they will not be able to read it. 
Be sure to back up your wallet after you encrypt it and destroy any old backups.
Investing in something you don't understand is generally a bad idea. If you are asking random strangers on the internet if Bitcoin is a good investment, then you shouldn't be investing in Bitcoin.

A transaction in the block chain can also be used to store a small amount of information.
A simple example is to compute the hash of a contract, title, or deed, and then store that hash in a transaction in the block chain. You can then prove that the document you have is that document and that it existed at that point in time. The stored information doesn't have to be in the form of a bitcoin address or private key.

Here is my take on your concerns:
1. Without a license, selling bitcoins as a business is illegal in many states in the U.S. There is nothing that Localbitcoins can do about that.
2. You must be careful to avoiding giving your passwords to hackers. That applies to all sites, not just Localbitcoins. Localbitcoins provides extra security features that traders can use to protect themselves.
3. There are some risks of being scammed when selling bitcoins on Localbitcoins. Sellers must be careful and expect to be scammed occasionally.
4. Coinbase will ban you if they suspect that you are selling bitcoins. There is nothing that Localbitcoins can do about that. Don't use Coinbase.
Buying bitcoins is very safe on Localbitcoins. You don't need to worry as long as you do the trade through the site.

2. I don't think banks could afford to buy up all the bitcoins. The more bitcoins they buy, the more expensive the bitcoins would get.
3. Even if they could buy up all the bitcoins, people would simply move to another coin, probably Litecoin. The banks would have spent a lot of money to accomplish nothing.

Transaction fees are optional. You don't have to pay a transaction fee if you don't want to. However, processing your transaction is also optional. The miner doesn't have to process it if they don't want to.
A miner will be motivated to process your transaction if you pay a fee. They might also do it if you don't, but then you are depending on their generosity.
In the end, you don't have to pay a fee, but you probably should.

It is not clear exactly what you are proposing, but it looks like a pyramid scheme, or at best borrowing from future transaction fees until it becomes unsustainable.
Let's say that transaction fees are 1 BTC per block, but we want to pay miners 5 BTC per block. So for every block, somebody "locks" 5 BTC which are paid to miners, and the 1 BTC of fees are split between the "investors".
After one day, 720 BTC have been paid to miners, 144 BTC have been repaid, break even occurs in 4 days.
After two days, 1440 BTC have been paid to miners, 288 BTC have been repaid, break even occurs in 8 days.
After three days, 2160 BTC have been paid to miners, 432 BTC have been repaid, break even occurs in 12 days.
See where this is going? At some point, it will take so long to recover the locked BTC that nobody will be willing to lock up their BTC.

That is confusing two unrelated mechanisms.
1. The "difficulty" of mining is used to fix the rate at which blocks are added, and also to fix the *rate* of new bitcoin creation. It is not used to limit the supply. The difficulty is determined by the total amount of mining effort expended by miners. If miners increase capacity, then mining just gets harder.
2. The limited supply is achieved by halving the subsidy every 210000 blocks (approximately every four years). Eventually, the subsidy will be halved down to 0, and no more bitcoins will be created. Miners also get paid transaction fees, so the total reward is not really cut in half.

The interesting thing about a fork is that a transaction takes place in both chains. That is, if you send bitcoins from 1abc... to 1xyz... those bitcoins are sent in both chains.
In the Ethereum fork, it was easy to prevent that from happening, so you could have separate coins on each chain, but in a Bitcoin fork it would not be possible (or at least, not easy) to prevent. The result is that you don't have separate coins.
Now, suppose there is a fork and you have 1 BTC. On one fork the 1 BTC is worth $1000 and on the other fork the 1 BTC is worth $10. Remember, if you send the BTC, you send on both forks. So, would you want to use the 1 BTC on the $1000 fork or the $10 fork? Obviously, most people will go with the fork with the higher value and the fork with the lower value will die.

For the newbies:
You sent some bitcoins before the transaction sending them to you was confirmed. That is always risky and most wallets either don't let you do that or they warn you about it.
The reason it is risky is that if the originating unconfirmed transaction is never confirmed (which is a possibility), then your transaction will never be confirmed .
In your specific case, not only is the transaction sending bitcoins to you not confirmed, but a transaction sending the bitcoins to your sender is not confirmed. In fact, there is a whole chain of transactions (8 in total) waiting for that one transaction to confirm. If that one transaction fails to confirm, then all 8 transactions will fail.

The term "replay attack" is a misnomer in this context. A replay attack involves reusing temporary credentials. (
What is being referred to here is the ability to include a transaction in both forks. Unless a Bitcoin fork is carefully formulated, there will be no way to ensure that a transaction is included in one fork but not in the other.
In my opinion, that is a good thing because it virtually guarantees that only one fork will survive. If a Fork X coin is worth $100 and a Fork Y coin is worth $1000, nobody will use Fork X because they will be sending their Fork Y coins, too.
Note that in the ETH case, it is possible to use coins one one fork and not the other. That is why there are now two Ethereum chains.

I think it is more along the lines of:
* small blockers feel that larger blocks reduce security, and layers on top of bitcoin will eventually allow increased transaction volume and micro-payments without reducing security. Preserving security while waiting for other solutions is the prudent course of action.
* large blockers feel that high transaction fees are doing serious damage to Bitcoin adoption, and developing layers on top of Bitcoin may take years. Larger blocks now instead of waiting for other solutions is imperative.

Before people freak out, let's review the math.
The are 11 million address with funds. Let's round that up to 2^24. The are 2^160 addresses. That means that there is an average of 1 used address for every 2^136 unused addresses.
They have checked 2000 trillion addresses. Let's round that to 2^51. That means that they have searched only 1/2^85 (1/32000000000000000000000000) of the average number of addresses to needed to be searched to find 1 used address.
Yet, they have found 2. 
That means that they have either achieved a level of luck that far exceeds winning any lottery, or some wallet software has a terrible bug.
Looking forward, it is extraordinarily unlikely that any more addresses will be found, unless that wallet software is still generating bad addresses. Even so, 2 out of 11 million is very small. Even 11 out of 11 million means a 1 in a million chance that your address is found.

In the long run, unreliable confirmation times and long backlogs are normal and expected. It may be too soon now, but they will be part of the future of Bitcoin. It is unavoidable, though I expect that ways to hide these problems from the public will be developed.
Here is why I believe that unreliable confirmation times and long backlogs are inevitable. It is necessary for miners to be paid for securing the network. In the future, when the subsidy is reduced to nothing, miners will have to be paid through transaction fees. Assuming that there is no limit on the block size, I expect that an optimum block size will eventually be discovered. (Otherwise, Bitcoin is doomed.) That means that not every transaction will be able to get into the next block, and that means that we will be right back here with unreliable confirmation times and long backlogs.

The labor theory of value has been discredited for a long time now. Likewise, mining cost does not affect price, but price affects mining cost.
Altcoins are cheaper, not because they cost less to mine, but because nobody wants them. As the demand for an altcoin rises, so does the cost of mining it.
**Consider trying this experiment:**
Make an altcoin that can only be mined on a CPU so that anyone can mine it. Include code that artificially raises the difficulty by a factor of 10 every 1000 blocks.
After a short period of time, the difficulty will be astronomical. If the price is affected by the cost of mining, then your coins could be worth millions of dollars!

A miner validates all the unconfirmed transactions and combines them into a block of data. The miner then sends the block to everyone on the bitcoin network and they link it into their copy of the block chain.
However, there are hundreds of miners and only one of them gets to add the next block to the block chain, so there needs to be a way to decide who gets to do it.
The way it is done is this: A miner runs a specific mathematical function (a "hash" function) on their block of data and if the result is less than a previously agreed on value (the "target"), then the block can be added. Generally, the first miner to get a successful result is the one that gets to add their block. If the result is not less than the target the miner makes an adjustment to the block and tries again. The difficulty of achieving a successful result is such that each miner will make trillions of attempts before somebody gets a result that is less than the target.
The successful miner gets to keep the block reward, which is all the transaction fees plus a subsidy of 12.5 bitcoins.
Once a block has been added, all the miners start on the next block with all of the new transactions.
If you are a member of a mining pool, then your role is only a part of the process. The mining pool does all the validation and block creation, and you just run the hash function.
Please note that this description is a very simplified version of the actual process.

My understanding is that with BTC-e (as with nearly all other exchanges), you don't have a wallet, you have an account. As such, 15sNZxi1CJxY33tgaoFwKhbMHe2gpRemz2 is a *deposit* address. Bitcoins sent to it are credited to your account and what BTC-e actually does with the bitcoins at that address has nothing to do with you.

Bitcoin is considered deflationary only because its supply is ultimately fixed, and we expect the world economy to continue growing forever.
However three scenarios could cause the value to drop significantly despite the fixed supply.
1. Fractional reserve banking. This is very likely to happen if bitcoin gains wide adoption.
2. Increased velocity of money. This is also very likely to happen if Bitcoin is as efficient as they say it is.
3. Economic catastrophe. It's not likely, but it is possible.
The likelihood of these scenarios are why I don't believe that a bitcoin will ever be worth $1,000,000 in today's dollars.

When people write that "cloud mining is a scam" they are exaggerating. There are some legitimate cloud mining sites. It would be more accurate to write that
1. *most* cloud mining sites are scams, and
2. the rest are generally not profitable as investments
Both of the these claims are backed up by a wealth of evidence.
I agree that cloud mining can possibly be a viable business, benefiting both the company and its customers, but whether or not that has been (or even can be) achieved in practice is questionable.


It is better to just buy bitcoins primarily because cloud mining is generally a poor investment. The typical result of a cloud mining contract is that the customer pays more in bitcoins than they receive from the contract. If they just buy the bitcoins directly, they would be better off.

There are two related meanings for the word inflation (and likewise, deflation).
1. Inflation is an increase in the money supply. This is typically referred to as "monetary inflation" Assuming that everything else is constant, monetary inflation would be expected to cause prices of goods to rise.
2. Inflation is an increase in prices of goods. This is typically referred to as "price inflation". One of the causes of "price inflation" is "monetary inflation", though there are other contributing factors.
Likewise, "deflation" is a drop in the money supply or a drop in the prices of goods.

Simply stated, 15sNZxi1CJxY33tgaoFwKhbMHe2gpRemz2 is not your account. It is not even an "account". It is a deposit address in the exchange's "hot wallet" that is associated with your account.
When bitcoins are sent to that address, your account is credited. Then the exchange is free to do whatever they want with those bitcoins.
When you withdraw bitcoins, they will not come from that address. They will come from some other address in their wallet. You can confirm this be looking at transactions in which you received bitcoins from your account at  BTC-e.

My guess is that there are millions of lost coins, but there is no reason to believe that one day everyone will realize that there are lost coins and the price will magically change. It doesn't work like that.
Price is determined by both supply and demand. Lost coins only affects supply so the best that can be said is that lost coins put upward pressure on the price.
Also, lost coins means that each circulating coin is more valuable, but coins that have already been lost have already affected the supply. Coins lost in the future will affect the future supply.

The economic characteristics of mining result in the tendency of the cost of mining to approach the value of the block reward. The article assumes that the value of the block reward (and thus the cost of mining) will increase to a point where Bitcoin is unsustainable.
**The truth is that the value of the block reward (and thus the cost of mining) will approach the value of the utility of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is sustainable in the long run.**
As for the comparison to Visa:
The cost of processing a Visa transaction involves much more than the cost of powering their data center.
The total cost of using Visa is equal to their revenue: $11.8 billion in 2013. The motherboard article says it processed 58.5 billion transactions, so it costs about $0.20 per transaction. Compare that to a priority bitcoin transaction -- $0.15 plus about $5.00 for the subsidy. It is very high, but it is not 5000x, and the subsidy will eventually drop to 0.

There are 58 different characters in an address, so the chances of any character followed by two more of the same are 1/58^2 (or about 0.03%). An address is typically 33 characters long, so the chances of any three characters in a row is 1 - ( 1 - 1/58^2 )^31 or about 0.9%.
Now, there is something called a "vanity address". A PC can generate millions of random addresses per second, and that makes it is feasible to generate random addresses until one is generated that meets a specific criteria (e.g. "1Leeet..."). The criteria determines how long it takes. "1Leeet" will take less than a day.
A vanity address is no less secure than a random address.

So you are claiming that Chinese exchanges are posting fake trades at inflated prices so that traders bid up the price on other exchanges? Why would traders do that if they are unable to sell at the fake price?
What do you mean by "When the volume swells in the buy side, the prices increase"?  Wouldn't an increase in the volume of bids signal expectation of lower prices? Someone placing a bid for 1 million BTC at $100 obviously believes that the price will drop to $100.

However, a legitimate cloud mining operator is the exception and not the rule.
Furthermore, even going with a legitimate cloud mining operation, the past has shown that you are unlikely to make a profit (compared to just buying the bitcoins outright).
One aspect of cloud mining that is very unclear to me is the benefit to the cloud mining company. For example, if you have a mining operation with a profit of 10 BTC per day, why would you rent that to customers for less than 10 BTC per day?

It doesn't need to be equally distributed. Let's suppose that bitcoins are equally distributed -- each person in the world has 0.003 BTC.

That is correct. If the value is higher than the cost of mining, then more people will mine, raising the difficulty and the cost. If the value is lower than the cost of mining, then people will stop mining, lowering the difficulty and the cost.

It is not clear if you are asking about the fees for those two transactions, or for a new transaction using the outputs of those two transactions.
If you are talking about a transaction using the outputs of those two transactions, then the inputs of those two transactions are irrelevant because a transaction input refers only to a transaction output. The only difference between two transaction outputs (in terms of size) is the script needed to spend them. A multisig output, for example, requires many signatures, so a transaction spending it will have a bigger script than the standard P2PKH output.
Anyway, in general ...
There is limited space in a block and there are more transactions pending than will fit in a block, so a miner trying to maximize its profit is going to choose smaller transactions paying higher fees over bigger transactions paying lower fees.
It all boils down to fee paid per byte.
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:14:03


The problem with your scenario is that an individual miner has no reason to fill a block with its own fake transactions, but there is an incentive to fill a block with real transactions. A miner doesn't collect fees on transactions that aren't in the block it mines.
On the other hand, a cartel of miners might be able to profit by setting a minimum fee for transactions they will include.

An individual miner has no reason to fill a block with its own fake transactions because it is easier and more effective to simply mine a block that is not full.
Now it should be obvious that an individual miner maximizes their revenue by including as many fee-paying transactions as possible. In most cases, any fee-paying transaction a miner does not include is lost revenue and lost profit. That is why we rarely see empty blocks.
On the other hand, there may be a percentage of hash power at which it is possible for a miner to increase profits by setting a minimum transaction fee. My guess is that there isn't one because we have yet to see any mining cartels setting minimum fees.

It's not clear why you believe that fewer new bitcoins results in higher transaction costs. Bitcoins are not consumed, so the supply continues to increase. Of course, as transaction volume increases, demand for bitcoins would rise due to the need to pay transaction fees, but it wouldn't necessarily increase the fees.

It is relatively easy for the seller to get scammed, which is why I never sold bitcoins using bank deposit.

That world cannot exist. Processing of Bitcoin transactions costs money and it has to be paid for somehow. Currently, most of the expenses are paid for by taxing bitcoin holders (12.5 BTC per block), and some of it is paid for by fees. Eventually, all of it will be paid for by fees. 


Consider this: in 2009, there were only a handful of CPUs doing the mining -- about 1/100,000,000,000 of the current hash power. Blocks still came out every 10 minutes. Bitcoin mining adapts to the current hashing power so that blocks are always produced every 10 minutes on average.

People that analyze the block chain can determine with some accuracy which addresses belong to which wallet providers. The number of bitcoins at an address does not provide as much information as the movement of those bitcoins.

@_date: 2016-09-26 01:58:34
No. Holding bitcoins long term simply takes them off the market, as if they were never mined in the first place. As the number of bitcoins is completely arbitrary, changing the number by holding long-term has no effect.
However, buying puts upward pressure on the price and supports *speculators*, which is why they want you to believe that long-term holding supports *Bitcoin*.

The primary purpose of mining is to validate transactions and miners are paid for their work by claiming the block reward. That fact is frequently forgotten. 
The 12.5 BTC created each block is called the "subsidy". Currently, transaction fees make up a very small portion of the block reward, with the subsidy being the larger portion. Eventually, the subsidy will drop to 0 and transactions will be paid for with only transaction fees.
Mining will become obsolete only if Bitcoin becomes obsolete.

I would like to provide some corrections that you might consider incorporating into your article:
1. Wallet -- A Bitcoin wallet does not actually hold coins. It holds the private keys (and their addresses) that give you access to your coins.
2. Fiat -- Fiat currencies (i.e. USD, euro, yen, etc.) are no more "physical" than a cryptocurrency. All modern currencies are digital.
3. Address -- You are confusing "wallet" and "address". A wallet is a container that holds addresses. Every wallet holds one *or more* addresses.
4. HODL -- hodl was originally a misspelling of "hold" in the title of a drunken rank on the Bitcointalk forum ( It has only recently been described as an acronym (making it a backronym). BTW, "hold on for dear life" would be HOFDL.
5. Private Key -- Again, you are confusing "wallet" and "address". A private key allows you to spend bitcoins at an address. A "password" protects your wallet, not a private key.
6. Public Key -- You are confusing "public key" and "address". They are not the same thing. If you want someone to send you bitcoins, you give them an *address*. A public key is used internally by the Bitcoin protocol. A user will rarely care about the public key.
You might also add this:
Seed -- a list of words (typically 12, 18, or 24) that a wallet uses to generate all of its private keys. The seed must be kept secret.
Keep up the good work.

Although some of his points are not as well-supported, I agree with his main points:

2. Bitcoin is extremely volatile. Short-term investment is no better than gambling.
I feel that his opinion based on these two points is appropriate for 99% of the investing public.
Also, you can't base the quality of an investment on current price or past performance. The fact that the price has gone from $1000 to $5000 doesn't make Bitcoin a better investment. In some ways, it makes it worse.

The paper wallet presumably has the private key written on it. You need to import the private key into the software that signs the message.
That sounds like a bad idea to me.
The purpose of a paper wallet is to allow only physical access to the private key, and only when you are ready to spend the bitcoins. Using the private key for other purposes is counter-productive.

Every 210,000 blocks, approximately every 4 years, the *subsidy* portion of the block reward is halved. This reduces the monetary inflation rate by half. The math works out such that the maximum number of bitcoins will be about 21 million.


Rather, it's fewer *new* bitcoin coming into circulation. The total number will grow until it reaches 21 million.


It is not deflation, since the number continues to grow. It is lower inflation, or *dis*-inflation.

I agree with you. Unless bitcoin has some utility that gives it value, it cannot be a "store of value".

You are stuck in the status quo. There are many possibilities and there far too many variables to make any accurate predictions about the value.
Let's suppose 1 BTC = $0.01.
If a block contains 2000 transactions (about 1 MB) and the average fee is 300 BTC ($3), then it will have the same value as it does today.
If a block contains 2,000,000 transactions (about 1 GB) and the average fee is 0.3 BTC ($0.003), then it will have the same value as it does today.
Both of those scenarios are plausible, though I think the second is more likely.

As more bitcoins are lost, the remaining become more valuable, and more effort will be expended to protect them.
For example, when a bitcoin was worth $0.01, people didn't care very much if they lost 100 bitcoins. But now that a bitcoin is worth $650, it is much less likely that someone will lose 100 bitcoins, though they might not care much if they lose 0.01 BTC. In the future, if a bitcoin is worth $10000, then people will be careful with even 0.01 bitcoins.

I agree with your analysis, but there is a difference between block size and *maximum* block size and you can't ignore cost.
A miner's cost determines its block size up to the maximum block size, and the optimal block will only include transactions whose fees are greater than the marginal cost.
As such, supply and demand work even with an unlimited block size.

Looking at the transaction (according to the txid you gave), you haven't lost your money (yet).
The problem is that the bitcoins that were sent to you come from a chain of unconfirmed transactions. As soon as those transactions are confirmed, you will see the bitcoins in your wallet. It is not clear why the first transaction in the chain is not confirmed.
The only danger is that if the transactions are not confirmed after some period of time (days perhaps), then they (including yours) might eventually be discarded, and you might never get your bitcoins.
The question now is where did you get your bitcoins from and why aren't their transactions being confirmed? You might avoid getting bitcoins from them in the future because they seem unreliable -- first, for having unconfirmed transactions, and second, for spending unconfirmed outputs.

Thank you for a good explanation of why the security of the network is equal to the amount of "wasted" energy.
I would also like to point out that any extra utility derived from mining (such as heating a building in the winter) only serves to increase the difficulty, and power consumption increases until its cost consumes the value of the extra utility.
For example, suppose a 1 TH/s Bitcoin miner costs $1 per day in power and produces $1 in BTC per day. It just breaks even. But suppose there is a new useful mining algorithm, and 1 TH/s now also provides $0.50 worth of information per day. Miners would increase their mining capacity because it would increase their profits. The total hash power would double and the with the new difficulty, a 1 TH/s miner makes only $0.50 per day. Including a cost of $1 per day and the $0.50 per day worth of information, the 1 TH/s miner just breaks even again -- but now the total power consumption has doubled.

You and the seller must agree on the amount in BTC. Without that agreement, there will be problems. Typically, the agreed amount is based on a published rate, or on the current rate at a particular exchange.

Today, GBP/USD  drops to 1.25, while BTC/USD remains at 600. What will happen to BTC/GPB?
If BTC/GPB is still 400, then traders will buy BTC with GBP (at 400), sell BTC for USD (at 600), and finally sell the USD for GBP (at 1.25) for a gain of £80/BTC. The buying in the BTC/GPB market will cause the price to rise to 480, at which point the arbitrage opportunity is gone.

There is no reason to do all of that when you can simply mine only transactions with a minimum fee. The question really boils down to the elasticity of demand.

Also, keep in mind that you are competing with other miners and they will pick up the fees that you exclude.

First, "traditional storage hardware" currently holds terabytes of data. The current block chain occupies less than 4% of a 1 TB drive. You can get cheap SD cards that have enough space to hold an entire block chain. There is no problem with running out of space.
Next, storing the entire block chain is optional. Once a node has received and processed a block, the block is no longer needed except for relaying to other nodes. The size of the block chain is only an issue to someone starting a new full node because they need the bandwidth to download the whole thing.

By adding dummy transactions to a block, a miner is giving up real money. Really, there is no reason to make dummy transactions when they can just include fewer transactions -- there is no requirement for a full block.
It might seem that a miner could make more money by limiting the supply of space in the block, but that overlooks the fact that they are competing with other miners. When a miner excludes a transaction, they are giving that transaction's fee to another miner, and the higher the value of excluded transactions, the more they are giving to another miner.

When you send bitcoins, the wallet will combine bitcoins from several addresses if it needs to. You don't have to specify which bitcoins to use. The wallet can figure that out.
Generally, when you receive bitcoins they all go to one address that you provide, or it could be to fifty addresses as in your first question. It doesn't matter because the wallet keeps track of all that.
You generally don't choose which bitcoins to send, but some wallets will let you choose if you want to.

The flaw in your logic is that there is no reason for the GDP to be represented by all the bitcoins. The U.S. monetary base is much less than $17 trillion, so why would bitcoin be different.
Here is a better estimate: The U.S. monetary base is $4 trillion. That is how much money is needed to power the U.S. economy. So if you divide $4 trillion by 15 million BTC currently in existence, you get $267,000 per bitcoin.
That is what a bitcoin would be worth if the U.S. switched entirely to Bitcoin.

It is extremely unlikely that two miners will "try the same solution" because their blocks will vary by at least the bitcoin address in the coinbase transaction.


Mining competition strongly motivates miners to increase capacity until the marginal profit approaches 0. Providing some external benefit does not change that. A miner that gains an external benefit from mining will increase their capacity until the total value wasted approaches the value of the external benefit plus the value of the block reward.


Miners perform a critical service (validating transactions). They get paid for it.

I don't think your method to predict the value of a bitcoin in the future is useful because there is no relationship between total wealth and the total amount of money.
A better method is to replace currencies, instead of wealth, with Bitcoin. For example, if Bitcoin completely replaced the dollar, then 21 million bitcoins would replace $8 trillion, so each bitcoin would be worth about $381,000.
I think it would be unreasonable to expect Bitcoin to completely replace the dollar (though it is possible) any time soon, but at least we know that $381,000 is the maximum value.
Now, if Bitcoin replaced 1% of the dollars, then a bitcoin would be worth $3810. If it replaced 10%, then it would be worth $38,100.
I think 1% is a good short term prediction, so my prediction for the value of a bitcoin is $3810 in 5-10 years.

There is no way to know the actual cost, but it is reasonable to assume that it is somewhere around the value of the bitcoins mined (at the time they were mined).
The reason is that if it costs more to mine bitcoins than the value of the bitcoins, then miners would stop mining until the miners that remain make profits. If it costs less, then there would be additional miners until it is no longer profitable.
On the other hand, the recent Litecoin halving showed that either litecoin mining is unusually profitable for most miners or that many litecoin miners mine at a loss. If Bitcoin is similar, then the above estimate is not accurate.

On August 1st, some people are configuring their nodes to only accept blocks that have a certain value set (the value indicates support for Segwit). This is referred to as UASF or BIP 148.
Because the main chain will include blocks that don't have this value set, this group of people will be splitting themselves off into a different chain, and thus a different coin because the chain defines the coin.
Because both chains are the same before the fork, ownership of coins before the fork remains unchanged. After the fork, the trick is to spend those coins independently on each chain.
If your bitcoins are in an account on an exchange or wallet provider, then it is up to them to decide on what to do with the two different chains. They may not do what is in your best interest. If you believe that the BIP 148 coins will have any value, you might want to move your bitcoins to your own wallet before the fork so that you can access this additional value.

Here's something that you probably didn't know: Your transaction included dust inputs that cost more to send than they are worth. At a fee of 300 s/b, the fee for an input is more than 0.0004 BTC.
To ensure that your transaction was included in the next block, you needed to pay a fee of about 0.0037 BTC, which is nearly half of your transaction. However, if you sent only 0.0071 BTC, your fee would have been only about 0.0008.

Traders on LBC generally stay away from credit/debit cards, paypal, and other services that allow chargebacks because the risk of fraud is too high. For example, a scammer could fund a prepaid debit card with a credit card, buy the bitcoins and then call up the CC company and have the money returned. The debit card would withdraw the money from the trader's account in order to return the money to the CC company. The trader cannot get the bitcoins back.

That's a misconception. The fees *will* cover the costs because the difficulty will drop and revenue will increase until enough miners leave to bring revenue in line with cost. 
The real problem is that the cost of mining may not be sufficient to protect the network from a 51% attack, and the root of that problem is a tragedy-of-the-commons.
Hopefully, in the next several years, miners will come up with a way to manage the max block size in order to maximize total fees.

Basically, it does. A UTXO is an unspent transaction output. If you are holding, then you are accumulating UTXOs.
The cost of a transaction depends (in part) on the number of UTXOs spent by the transaction. If you are accumulating bitcoins in many small amounts, your transactions will be more expensive than if you received your bitcoins in bigger amounts.

Here is how a merkle proof works.
To prove that the data is authentic, all the hashes of the other data that eventually combine with the hash of the data in question are provided. The user can easily combine those values and check that the result the same as the root hash. The proof relies on the assumption that if the data is altered, an alternate set of hashes that results in the correct root cannot be computed.
In the example in the article, the hash of the green data ("9Dog:64") is hashed together with all the yellow boxes and the result is checked against the root hash of 6c0a. The proof consists of the following hashes: hash of "1FXq:18", ec20, 8f74. The user then computes the following:
result = HASH("9Dog:64")
result = HASH(hash of "1FXq:18" | result)
result = HASH(ec20 | result)
result = HASH(result | 8f74)
if result is 6c0a, then the data is valid.

There are 2,100,000,000,000,000 "bitcoin units". If bitcoins were named, then each one would require 51 bits.
At the current value, a transaction transferring $1 would transfer about 222,000 units resulting in a transaction size of about 1.4 MB.

There is a value in a block that a miner uses to tell everyone that they can process Segwit transactions and blocks. Currently, Segwit blocks and transactions are not considered valid, but when enough blocks have this value set, then miners and nodes will start considering Segwit transactions and blocks to be valid, and wallets will create Segwit transactions and miners will mine Segwit blocks. Note that each miner and node will decide for itself when to turn on Segwit.

Supply and demand numbers involve a lot more than just the new bitcoins mined each day. They involve all bitcoins traded each day, or more accurately, all bitcoins. Mined bitcoins are only a small portion of that.
Also, in order for the price to stay the same, demand must increase at the same rate as the supply. So, if demand stays constant, then the price will fall as the supply continues to increase. I'm sure you meant to write that "if the rate of increase in demand stays constant", but even that is a bad assumption.

Currently, Bitcoin fees are very high because there is limited space for data, so that made it even worse for you.

When you write that "software doesn't work like that", you are referring to projects like Debian or Apache, where everyone contributes to the same project. In those cases, there is no need for consensus as there are organizations that deal with governance.
Bitcoin is not like that. Bitcoin is like email, http, or ftp, where there are many projects implementing a specification so that they can inter-operate. However, Bitcoin even differs from those projects in how governance works. In those cases, governance works by committee and authority, whereas in Bitcoin, basic governance is built in to the protocol and involves consensus of miners directly and users indirectly.

The author of the posts you are quoting doesn't seem to have a full understanding. There is some confusion over production and supply. The production of bitcoins is halved. The supply continues to increase toward 21 million. Also, bitcoin production is fixed regardless of the resources put into mining.
I'm not sure how you came up with your triangle, but my position is:
1. Accepted as currency: Bitcoin is not widely accepted *yet*. It may be weak in this regard now, but it is getting stronger as adoption increases.
2. Equity: Bitcoin has no measurable equity, but neither does any other currency.
3. Social Network: A crisis of confidence is always a possibility, as it is with any currency, but there is no reason why such a crisis would be associated with the block reward.

There is no formula and there is no deeper understanding. There are three prices on an exchange:

* *ask price* - the lowest price anyone is currently willing to accept for their bitcoins
* *last price* - the price at which the last trade took place

Describing a second layer as a "necessity" demonstrates a lack of perspective. It assumes that a particular opinion is an indisputable fact.
It is wrong to characterize a second layer as a "necessity" because Bitcoin currently works without a second layer. Therefore it is not a necessity.
It is correct to consider a second layer to be an addition that can solve a certain set of problems effectively.
I believe that LN may be an effective solution to the buying-a-cup-of-coffee problem, providing that it actually works as advertised. But, unlike others, I don't consider it to be the only solution and I don't believe that bigger blocks exclude additional layers.

 &gt;   Bitcoin hash rate down more than 10% since halving. Block times increasing. "Experts" were wrong so far...
Different experts were predicting different scenarios. Some were wrong and some were right (so far).


The amount of work being done is determined by the "difficulty" value. Longer average block time simply implies that the work is being done more slowly.


The price is determined by supply and demand. It is not determined by the amount of work done. The opposite is true. The amount of work done is indirectly determined by the price.

They are now ... well, at least they were. But starting in 2014, the price was dropping for two years. It didn't fully recover until the beginning of this year.
You don't know if the price is going to go up or go down, so you might as well buy some bitcoins, spend them, and then buy some more.
Anyway, the OP was asking if the price can only go up if the money supply is constant, and the answer is no.

The headline is misleading. The author is saying that the GBTC premium is outrageous and cannot be maintained. I totally agree. The only way a holder of GBTC can profit now is if Bitcoin continues its meteoric rise. At some point, the Bitcoin price will stumble and the premium will drop, and GBTC holders will lose big time.
As for shorting, there is no effective way to short GBTC. That is one of the reasons why the premium is so high.
The other reason is the lock-up period for Authorized Participants. If it weren't for the lock-up period, a person could exchange bitcoins for shares in GBTC and immediately sell them, making an instant 125% profit.

"Wasted" is ambiguous, of course. "One man's trash is another man's treasure."
In this context, "wasted" means that there is no benefit other than solving a block. Because of how the difficulty is determined, hashing that provides any additional value raises the difficulty without providing additional security (because presumably an attacker would also be able to obtain additional value from hashing).

In general, you can, but it isn't something I would recommend that a newbie attempt, unless you use a particular wallet that is designed to do that (such as blockchain.info). Unless you have rooted your phone or you install lots of sketchy stuff on it, a wallet on your phone is safe and convenient. My main wallet is on my phone.
