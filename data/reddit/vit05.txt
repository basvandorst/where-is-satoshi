The odd part is that I believe SmokeTooMuch has lost tons of Bitcoin on MTGox.

I didn't know about this series. Looks really cool, 8.1 on IMDB. I will try to watch, thanks.

And it is an Old parody.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:22:35
I have[ asked]( about that before and people just downvoted me. :(
But I am really excited when movies start to use Bitcoin in a common way and not only about criminal actives.
Some series have already used but what it would be cool is when futurists movies start to use.

I have understood something totally different. As I see, he does not think just about a currency.
He is talking that he will try to understand the motivation behind what is called cryptographic and decentralization.
And that is not only about the coin market. That means a lot more. The world is moving in a direction that would collide with the ideas behind the invention of Bitcoin.
Everything will change. And he will try to adapt before see his business be disrupted. There is an article on [Verge]( that talks about small communities, I think she missed that the point is that people want more decentralization, privacy and power.

They all talked about Bitcoin. But was only used for criminal actives. What I mean is a movie that uses Bitcoin as something that is already mainstream.

How not? 
He was the first to make the bitcoin.org more accessible, I think he was responsible for the foruns too. And I believe he introduces the term Cryptocurrency to Bitcoin.

Awesome :)
I use this [Excel spreadsheet]( to track my trades. Unfortunately, I was never able to import the function to GoogleSheet. Maybe you can import some of their functions into your spreadsheet.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:18:15
I have done one [GoogleSheet]( using coinmarket too. This is just an example, but in the one that I use and edit, I put the ATH and other graphics.
But I am still not able to find a great way to calculate the profits. So, for that, I use another Excel sheet where I can download the trade history directly from the exchanges and just update.
Edit. The transaction part of your sheet is great. I will start to use. tks

This answer shows how smart you are. It is hard to find a name that fits so well with an organization. Thanks for what you are doing. 
I do not know about any organization that teaches about making the most useful for your money when you do not have so much. It is hard to know how to save, how to spend and how to find good lending when you do not have education and money. 
It would be great if you donate to an organization that helps poor people about that.

Put someone to engrave the address on a gold plate and them, after he finished, kill him.

This is necessary. People starting doing stupid things and irrational choices. Those people could have never seen a big dip and thought it would always go up.

9 months ago I have posted this:
BTC breaks 6k. =\ 
I miss this guy. But I am glad 6k has shown to be one of the strongest lines ever.
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:52:48
Yep. I have searched and didn't found. Could someone post where he says?
@_date: 2018-10-21 04:06:27
It is possible to use the blockchain to see the path to where most of the new crated Bitcoins go? This way it will be possible to see if they are going to exchanges, to whales, OTC or being used to pay for things.

I think people should give some BTC to the guy that have "call" 6k. Because it is possible one of the strongest support ever. :)

They did not say which coin was hacked. That's strange. Was Bitcoin or another project? It could hit hard it was a small project that only lives in exchanges like Nano.

I always laugh when I read "Reply by Satoshi Nakamoto on March 7, 2014 at 1:17

But still better than nothing. The problem could be to rely 100% on these systems. And the question is that he supposedly could, but there is still no evidence he has broken.

Oh Boy!
So, how exactly you could close a channel using a restored backup?
@_date: 2018-03-12 05:09:48
Because the article was already posted. So people are just trying to get karma or followers to their accounts.

This is necessary to give liquidity to the exchanges since the Market Cap has increased a lot. If Tether stopped to be 1x1 USD, they will have no utility.

They do not say you need to hodl their token for a year. You could just sell after receiving.

I think I got to the party late, I spent most of my time reading the answers. But from the point of view of a business, when a company goes bankrupt it sells various goods, including its brand. Even with all the confusion, MtGox is still a very strong brand and is likely to be one of the 5 most known among those related to Cryptocurrency. Is there any plan to auction the brand?

Where can I find the transcription of what he talk about? I would like to translate.
