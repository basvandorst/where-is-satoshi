You are factually incorrect:
Dec 15th, 2018-May 1st2019 prices in BTC
ETH: .026  to .021  
XRP: .000089 to .000056
LTC: .0074 to .013
BCH: (newbies beware, this is a scamcoin): .027 to .029  
Note: all 4 have fallen significantly as well since May 1st.
There is no "season".  The numbers directly refute your claim.

You might be operating under a misunderstanding.  
BTC transactions post instantly....just like credit cards.  
Furthermore, YOU control how fast confirmations take....to as few as 5 minutes on average for the next block.... unlike cc's where neither you nor the merchant can speed up the process, which takes WEEKS to confirm.  
Most transactions (say, my routine purchase of lunch) doesn't need a fast confirmation, and so I pay a minimum.  If I were to purchase, say, a car or a house, THEN a premium would be justified so that the tx can be confirmed quickly.
When I purchase at a brick and mortar store, the merchant accepts the risk and permits the sale without confirmation for either BTC or CC's....  They are both equally fast.

If the IRS wants to come after me for the taxes on my weekly sub purchase, more power to them.
HINT:  They aren't going to bother except for big purchases (house, car) and when you sell back into fiat.
The IRS has better things to do than calculate whether the tax on my sub should have been 47 or 48 cents.
Hell, the value of the IRS doing all the legwork for me is worth more to me than the taxes due.

define "huge":  Put it in context with other forms of exchange:  credit cards, bank transfer, ATM fees.
Now, understand that BTC offers a new mix of benefits:  Decentralized, borderless, permissionless, pseudo-anonymous, peer to peer, massive POW security, etc.
I find what little fees I pay (about 35 cents for my last transaction) to be quite reasonable given the benefits it offers.  And that's on chain for major transactions, without even going down the LN outlets for minor transactions.

Over 4 years, not a single BTC holder has failed to ATLEAST double the value of their holdings.
If you are a beginner, plan to hold for at least 4 years. 
Every 4 years their is a reduction in the rate of Bitcoin supply.  This puts upward pressure on the price (among other factors...which are more important, but less easy to see).
Buy a tiny bit. 
Buy some more.
Learn some more.
Then, when you are ready, invest an amount that you can afford to be without for at least 4 years.
4 years later, you should be experienced enough to determine your long term plan.

There is a base amount (currently 12.5 BTC)...this is the fixed reward.  This reward is granted to the first miner who solves a difficult math problem (but easy to prove if solution is correct).
A miner could stop there.  However, as an incentive, if they include the transactions that are waiting to process they also collect the fees associated with that transaction.
Imagine a bus stop with hundreds of people waiting.  A bus pulls up, and lets people on the bus according to how much they are willing to pay.  If you are in a rush, you offer the driver a high amount.  If you have time, you wait for a later bus that won't be so crowded.
So, the miner is currently guaranteed 12.5 BTC, plus they have the option of including as many transactions (and their fees) as they want (and can fit in the bus).

Rather, understand that this tech is absolutely revolutionary, and only invest what you can afford to be without for several years.
Hint: the halving cycle of BTC is 4 years.  Not a single person who has held BTC for at least 4 years have failed to at least _double_ the value of their holdings.
@_date: 2019-07-05 17:41:42
For a new person, everything, will _seem_ like a spike or a crash, because no traditional investments come close to the swings that BTC has.
Trying to predict when BTC price has topped (and bottomed) out is a skill I have yet to grasp... and I doubt anyone else has either.  But over the long term, yeah, there's a definite trend, and that trend is still growing exponentially.
I don't recommend trying to time the market (guessing when a spike has peaked or a valley has been reached).  That is....unwise for a novice.
Spend your time learning : how to purchase safely, how to store safely, how to identify scams, why is btc different than fiat, what are the limitations of BTC, and what are the mechanics of how BTC works.

As the world sees an entire society flipping successfully using BTC, the next weakest currency will be faster to adopt.  Then the next...  and the next.
Ironically, this will have the effect of making the first regions to adopt the best positioned, and regions with strong (fiat) currencies will have to play catch-up at a disadvantage.

I love that you give advice on the proper way to invest in pyramid schemes.  :-)
Not a single person who has held for a full BTC cycle (4 years) has ever lost money on BTC.  This is due to the very real halving cycle.  If you are "investing" for a shorter time-span, you aren't investing, you are trying to time the market.  Good luck with that.

At that price point, minimizing fees will be important to you.
Fees can come from the exchange, or from transferring to your wallet within BTC.
For your initial purchase, READ what options enable you to minimize fees.  Buying with a CC is about the most expensive option there is....  look for the pro-trader, bank transfers and set a bid to keep the fees down.
Once you have the BTC on the exchange, MOVE the BTC to your wallet.  For that price point, you might be ok having it on your phone or your laptop, but that's a risk.  You won't have quite enough to justify a hardware wallet (those cost in the $80-100 range, last I checked).  But long term that's something you should think about.  I echo the calls to watch videos from Andreas Antonopoulos.  He has a knack for explaining things in a way that appeals to wide audiences.
You are new, so it's easy to conflate your exchange with BTC.  They are not the same.
Might want to start small...  say, a $10 purchase, knowing that it will get eaten up with fees, but you'll how to move it around and even if you mess up, that's something you can live with.  Then once you know the ropes, you can make your more efficient purchases for the larger amount.
Good luck and keep educating yourself...  you have an edge on everyone else who haven't taken that first step yet.

Neither does BTC.
Usually, it increases in value over the period of a few months.  Whereas fiat inevitably decreases.
I will happily purchase your BTC with fiat if you doubt the long term value of BTC.
Furthermore, if you increase your time scale to a few years, instead of a few months, you'll see that at no point has BTC ever dropped in value.

The merchant was passing along their processing charges, not the BTC fee; this will become more common in credit cards as well in the US due to some recent legal victories by merchants against the cc companies.

A common misconception.
BTC operates just like CC's do in the sense that the transaction must be posted (which happens in mere seconds)  The actual merchant payment happens much later.... after a few confirmations for BTC, after weeks for CC.
Merchants accept the doublespend (for BTC) and chargeback (for CC) risk because on the whole that happens infrequently and getting the sale is much, much more important that ensuring they get 100% of the payments.
For very large payments (like a car or home sale) the merchant would make you wait.... but for lunch at the deli?  No, doesn't happen.

Lets run some exemplary math:
He bought a year ago...that would be about $6100
He purchased his VPN yesterday.... that would be about $11200
So, out of his $120 payment, that represents: 120(1 - 6100/11200) = $54 in capital gains.
In the US, capital gains over 1 year are taxed at 0%, 15% and 20% depending on your income.
Lets assume since he has money to invest, he makes more than 40k per year (eliminating the 0% rate) but lets also assume he's not a 1%er (eliminating the 20% rate)  So his capital gains rate is 15%.
15% of $54 is $8.19
If anyone thinks the IRS has the time or inclination to fiddle over $8.19, well, I don't know what to say.
Yes, I agree the US tax treatment of crypto is messed up, but at the volumes this guy is purchasing, I'd not worry about it.
The IRS realistically is not going to go after small purchases like this.  A house? Yes.  A car? Yes.  Convert a balance to another crypto or back to fiat? Yes.  But the IRS, I can safely say, does not want the accounting headache of trying to track down a $8 capital gains.

This is absolutely true....in the short term.  Some won't survive.  Others, knowing the halving is coming, have set aside reserves to weather the storm and still be around afterwards.  As some miners drop out, the difficulty will decrease, and the survivors will return to profitability.
I suspect most will survive, preparing for the halvening and realizing that BTC has MORE THAN doubled in price every 4 years, and all trends seem to point to that continuing.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:26:33
No person in the history of BTC who has purchased and held for one full Bitcoin cycle (approximately 4 years) has failed to double the value of their holdings.  Most have increased by a factor of 10.
If you are jumping in and out of the system on timescales shorter than 4 years, not only are you exposing yourself to short term capital gains taxes, but you are also trying to "time the market".  
I am not smart enough to time the market.
I very strongly doubt anyone posting in a reddit forum is smart enough to time the market.

Thank you for the thoughtful post; 
I'm wary of UBI, but I have to agree that particular idea sounds intriguing.  I probably wouldn't be too opposed to a system like that.  If only the majority of our taxes were collected (and distributed) at the state rather than the federal level, we could run these sort of experiments to see how they turn out before converting whole-hog.
Technological unemployment is coming, I agree, but I doubt the speed at which it will happen is as drastic as some suggest.
After all, we have automated away 95% of the workforce before (farmers) and we don't have millions of unemployable farmers on the public dole.  Nor do we have lines full of switchboard operators, typists, elevator operators, or telephone installation techs.  Self driving automobiles are wonderfully exciting, but they haven't even managed to put train-drivers out of work yet...  and free-driving cars are vastly more complex than following train tracks.  Also, I firmly believe that Unions will fight automation tooth and nail--and lose--as they have for decades.  So that will slow the process.
I feel that some people who want to see UBI or whatever social change champion technological unemployment as the "reason" to institute their desired end state.  A solution seeking a problem, rather than the other way around.  Normally they say "well, automation will happen so _quickly_ we need to be prepared and institute change X now"....  and I just don't see it happening that fast.
Finally, the planet could very well do for a smaller population, so from strictly an environmental reason....  why subsidize a large population at all?  But that's so off the deep end of philosophy I'll just leave that an open-ended question.
In any case, thanks for the response.

If you plan on holding BTC for only a year you are doing it wrong.
BTC natural halving cycle is 4 years long.  Anything less than that and you are basically trying to time the market.  (And I, for one, freely admit I am not smart enough to do that)

As more and more wealth is held in BTC, they will absolutely want to get a piece of that wealth.
And the holders of the BTC will choose who to do business with.
Right now, most (99.99%) of wealth is held in dollars/fiat... but what happens when 1% of wealth is in BTC?  10%?  
Right now just over 10% of the US population speaks Spanish at home.  Many, many businesses offer services in Spanish in order to get access to that market.  Same thing with BTC.

Oh, I never tell people to accept BTC.  That tells them "I have this stuff I am willing to part with in exchange for your product" and actually devalues BTC, in my opinion.
I just seek out places and products that do already sell for BTC and give them my business if they have something I want.
I tell anyone who will listen that I accept BTC as payment for anything they might owe me for.  A much more positive message.

The merchant is passing along the processing costs to the user; this will become more common in credit cards as well in the US due to some recent legal victories by merchants against the cc companies.
Expect to see more merchants charging surcharges for cc use &gt; this is good for BTC because merchants have the ability to accept BTC without a processor if they like.
@_date: 2019-06-19 12:08:36
The merchants I use accept the public posting of the tx, they don't wait for a confirmation.  They accept the very small doublespend risk because, well, it hasn't been a problem for them.  The transaction posts publicly instantly.
As someone who is rooting for BTC, I certainly wouldn't screw over a merchant.
I suspect for very large transactions, they might wait for a confirmation.  Someone who sold a house using BTC had to have multiple confirmation in escrow before the paperwork was signed, for example.
But for a lunch?  No, they want to expedite the tx.

Sure it can; you just need to look at a slightly longer time span:  BTC's life-cycle is 4 years.  100% of people who hold BTC 4 years or longer have _at least_ doubled the value of their holdings.
Trying to get in and out of BTC in less than 4 years is foolhardy.  It is a long term store of value.

1) Congratulations for not panic selling.  I'm sure that was (is) super scary.   Losses are on paper until you realize them by converting to cash or another currency.
2)  I feel very, very confident that BTC has not hit its ATH.  Not even close.
3) I feel holding BTC on timescales shorter than 4 years (one full halving cycle) is just trying to "time the market".... and is closer to gambling than actually using the value BTC offers.
4) Not a single person who has held their BTC for 4 years has failed to at least double the value of their holdings.  Not one.  Let that sink in. 
5) I (AManInBlack2019) encourage you (DaveIsHereNow) to set your goal to hold at least 4 years from the time of your initial purchase.
6) Be sure to take your BTC and get it off the exchange.  Don't put more in a soft wallet (like your phone) than you would normally carry in cash.  A hard wallet (like a Ledger or similar) is ideal for cold storage of larger amounts.   Wallets have keys.  The key is more important than the device...  you can smash your wallet and still get your coins back if you have the key.... but not the other way around.  Don't share your private key.  Give your public key to whoever you think might pay you.
7) Once again, kudos for hanging on....  Good for you.

What struck me is how the article shoehorned his bitcoin trading in to an article that is essentially about someone claiming sovereignty
It's kindof irrelevant to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:39:32
The short answer is no.
A longer answer is there is a very short window that it might be a threat.  But when that window gets even conceivably close, the community (in their own self-interest) can switch to quantum-safe encryption relatively easily.  It isn't anywhere near close right now, but will be addressed in the future.
However, if it even approached being a threat to BTC, it would also threaten traditional banking, government encryption, everything that uses those vulnerable systems.  It will be Y2K in scale... and similarly managed.

Nope, not crazy.  The federal suit just closed in 2017.  Lots of companies probably _want_ to implement this, they just don't want to be the first.  Once enough small businesses get the consumers used to this idea, the major chains _will_ follow suit.  I suspect chains that have lots of small dollar orders will be the first... McDonalds or Starbucks is a prime example.  Fast food was one of the last markets to use credit cards, and will likely also be the first to add the surcharge.
Anyone interested in learning more I suggest googling "credit card processor merchant federal lawsuit surcharge" for lots of relevant articles.

@_date: 2019-09-04 15:03:49
Because your premises are wrong.
you said: Can't spend it anywhere
I answer:  I spend it regularly and frequently.   Since your premise is it can't be spent _anywhere_, and I could spend it _somewhere_, your premise is disproven.
you said: fees are high
I answer: compared to what?  It's certainly cheaper to send value overseas using BTC than it is using banking remittances.  And I hope you get used to the idea of paying an extra 3-4% on your purchases with credit cards...in the US more and more merchants are tacking on that fee.  True, cash has no fee...  oh, wait, ATM fees are costing people / making banks millions....
you said: confirmation times are too long
I say: BTC confirmation times (10 mins on average) are far, far faster than credit cards.  You are simply misinformed.  You probably think that your transaction is over when you swipe the card and it is approved.  That merely starts the process; the merchant won't see funds confirmed for weeks from your purchase.  Oh, and the merchant must also suffer the risk of a chargeback, so it definitely is not "confirmed".  No physical BTC merchant has _ever_ asked me to wait even the 10 min for a BTC confirmation; Can you imagine if a merchant made you wait weeks for a CC confirmation?  Lol.
You said: BTC is great as speculation
I say: I agree!
You also fail to consider some other reasons BTC is valuable:  Pseudo-anonymous; non-inflationary; peer-to-peer, borderless, permissionless, digital, etc.

I'm afraid that's beyond my expertise.
But think of it this way....  a nation state would have to build not one, but _several_ power plants dedicated to this mining takeover attempt.
Off the top of my (novice) head: if it were made public, people could just move to other crypto (with different mining requirements) that is not being targeted.  And existing miners would certainly oppose the takeover attempt of their industry, as well.
Finally, this would be very unprofitable; the nation state would have to exert national-level resources for little to no gain....  Great, you killed BTC.  But you didn't do anything about cryptocurrency X or Y, who by the way, watched your efforts and moved to protect themselves from a similar attack.

Take the current price, and draw a horizontal line across the price graph.  Count the number of days that have a (arbitrary closing time) price above that price.
I estimate BTC has a count somewhere around 130 or so.
FWIW, I think the DJIA would have a higher count than that right now. 
In a completely unrelated note, I think BTC will reach 30,000 before the DJIA does.

2017 was tumultuous; the community had a rift with the departure of not only the BCH folks, but the introduction of Segwit AND the failed fork/takeover attempt (S2X, I think, or something similar)
Truly a wild ride.
As the prices raced upwards, people were understandably giddy.  10k was the major milestone, for psychological reasons, of course.  Many of the old-timers had set that as their "Moon" and I remember one individual posting pictures of their celebration party with guests holding 10K placards amongst plenty of champagne-filled glasses.
Everyone was happy, because all the alt-coins so closely mirrored BTC.  Coin X took off by 10% yesterday?  Coin Y did it today, and everyone was a winner. 
Still, most on the forums correctly predicted that the euphoria far, far exceeded what could be sustained.  People preached caution once 10k was reached, and no one expected the ride to go on at that pace forever.  It was jumping 2k/day sometimes.
I, for one, stopped working my normal job.  I openly just watched the BTC spot price jump, realizing on paper I had earned more in a day that I would working my full-time job in a week.  My boss wasn't even mad, it was understandable.  _Everyone_ was talking Bitcoin.  Coworkers came to me and asked how to get started, and of course I warned them to only learn the process, that buying at that point was emotional, not logical.  I limited their purchases to $10 so they could see what it was like on CB, then told them the next steps to getting a cold wallet.
The turnaround was dramatic, and brought out the nay-sayers.  I simply avoided BTC news for a several months.  I never purchased more than I could afford to lose, and that kept me sane.  Most of my friends sold their amounts...  thinking they could time the bottom and get back in later.  (I'm not smart enough to do that)
So 2017 started with much animosity and spite, and all that gave way to the realization that no matter your "side" we were all going to be ok.
My only advice for anyone who has read this far:  Don't buy BTC in order to "turn a quick profit".....  Buy with the intent to hold no less than 4 years.  That will give you the time to go through a full cycle, and limit you to purchasing only what you can afford to be without for that period of time.

Merchants are tired of subsidizing the ever-increasing rewards for credit card users.  Someone is paying for all those airline miles/cash back options, and the merchants are tired of footing the bill.  
Credit cards attract customers by offering better benefits &gt; credit cards fund benefits by charging merchants more &gt; merchants get fed up and charge more for credit card use/cash discount  &gt; BTC slips in as a peer-to-peer, digital cash option.

Ah, I see your distinction.
Hmmm.... functions....
medium of exchange
store of value

standard of deferred payment
I'd definitely say store of value is the best for BTC among those right now.  However, all signs are pointing up for long term improvements in the rest of those categories as well.
I think the store of value will inexorably drag other currencies down, and with widespread use comes all the others.  Those others can't be realized without widespread adoption (a plurality of the local population, for sure).

Someone recently posted a unique metric....
For any given price, there are only X number of days that BTC was above that price....  So, in all of BTC history, there was only like 152 days that people could have purchased and have less value than they have at the time...
When BTC (inevitably) matches the ATH, that number would finally reach 0.
Anyone have a way to get that count easily?  As a very rough guess, I think that number is down to about 120 days.

Well, by your definition:
A: Utility: I have routinely used it for various purchases/transfers.  Since 1 &gt; 0 or none, I have already proven you wrong here.
B: Profitable.  Wildly so.  Moreso than anything else I have invested in.
C: Beneficial.  I know of no other way that lets me send value as inexpensively, quickly, permissionlessly, and as privately as BTC, especially across borders.
The total amount of fees you mentioned are so small that they are less than than ATM fees, Credit card fees, or god forbid the fees associated with wiring money.  I have _never_ needed to exchange my BTC back for fiat, because I find it useful (utility) as it is.  I avoided exchange fees entirely by placing an maker/taker order on the exchange, not a market order.  
By choosing the slower bank transfer method, I avoided the fees that some novices experience using credit cards to fund their exchange account.
Finally, I moved my BTC off the exchange into my own wallet, so now I'm my own bank!
As of my most recent transaction, my transaction fee was 2sat/B. (Confirmed in 20 minutes, btw)
2sat/B X 250 B tx (typical 1 input, 2 output transaction size) X 1BTC/100000000sat * $5750/BTC = about 3 cents.
Yes, I can afford 3 cents.  And mind you, that amount is independent of the amount of purchase.  (Something that is NOT true for wire transfers or credit card transactions)
My initial accumulation of BTC has increased in value so much that I have almost tripled the equivalent fiat value in my accounts as I originally purchased, AND I have been routinely making purchases using BTC along the way.  
TL/DR: BTC has function both as a utility AND as an investment for me.  
If you have a problem with BTC, I'd be happy to pay you 100% of the current market value for your holdings (you pay the wire fees, and I'd pay the BTC tx fees)
I am quite happy to accumulate more!

Mansa Musa.  Richest person who ever lived.
He went on vacation once, and spent so much money he hyper-inflated the currencies of all the countries he visited, ruining their economies as he went.  On his return trip, he bought up all the gold he had previously distributed to the poor just to fix the economies.
He took hundreds of camels, each bearing hundreds of pounds of gold.  Oh, and an entourage of 12,000 slaves, each carrying 4 pounds of his gold.  His empire had over half of the worlds known gold supply.
Wealthier than Caesar (estimated at 4 trillion).
Fun bonus fact:  If one were to take all of the world's current supply of above-ground gold and melt it into a cube, it would only be about 21meters h/w/l.

The race for 30,000 between BTC and DJIA is still on.....
and I'm still betting on BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:52:29
BTC will hit 30k before the DJIA...
@_date: 2019-05-02 15:31:22
Ah, so you think all the major countries in power now will remain so...forever?
Good luck with that.

So tired of people pushing the quantum computers narrative.
A)  So, so much more is equally "vulnerable"....SHA256 is used in all sorts of non-BTC encryption....
B) BTC can easily soft-fork over if quantum computing became remotely a realistic threat.

Firefighters--local govt
Roads--mix of federal, state, and local govt
Police--local govt
It's when people want one-size fits all Federal control of everything that the reveal themselves as socialists.  There are bonafide differences in different states, and different regions....  race/income/density/industry to name a few.  One size does not fit all, and diversity should be supported.

It's easy to mine, but it's hard to mine _profitably_.
The individual can easily set up a miner, but the cost of your electricity and hardware will likely exceed your BTC revenue because professional miners have access to lower cost electricity and economy of scale the individual may not.
However, if you have a free source of electricity, the odds move to your favor again.

True, true.
Andreas Antonopolous is my favorite YouTube speaker, but he's more geared towards explaining what BTC is to general audiences (though he's a software guy himself)
There are lots live forums that developers go to for that cutting edge stuff....  things like breaking-bitcoin.com (this year in Amsterdam)...but get ready to pay big admission fees, not really geared for the layperson.
Just put on your hip-waders, links show up here all the time on all sorts of topics.  Even if the discussion here isn't developer oriented, there are links to sites that are.

Since your premise is "all crypto use is speculative" even a single use of crypto that is non-speculative disproves your stance.
I pay my monthly VPN with crypto.
I for my lunch weekly with crypto.
I sent money to my family overseas with crypto.
I have purchased products from online retailers with crypto.
My friends settled their bar tab with me in crypto.
All of this was done peer to peer, without asking permission from anyone. 
I have effectively and repeatedly used BTC for more than speculation, therefore your premise is disproven.

If you judge a crypto by the people who are on a reddit forum....
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:55:08
still 152/2500 is a pretty small fraction.
(2500 being a dartboard guess at the # of days BTC has traded on markets)
I also believe that the DJIA has more "negative investment" days than BTC right now.....

In the last 90 days, I have:
Purchased a sub from the local deli (multiple times)
Paid my monthly VPN bill (multiple times)
Purchased some merchandise online
Sent my family money...both overseas and across the country.
Received payment from a friend as reimbursement for a shared bar tab.
But go on, push your narrative.

Hello redditor for 4 weeks!
So you are saying BTC will never go above 12k.  I see. Let's check back in 4 years, shall we?
Furthermore, BTC is more than an investment vehicle....it is a permissionless, pseudo-private, and borderless payment option.
If BTC remained stable at today's price for the next 100 years, that would be a wild success even though no one doubled their investment.
Thinking about BTC merely as an investment doesn't really show understanding about the nature of a cryptocurrency.  It's a currency whose valuation ebbs and flows (like any other currency)...but unlike any other currency, the supply is fixed.  This puts upward pressure on the valuation compared to currencies that are inherently inflating their value away.

Iran actively supports terrorist groups.  They have committed attacks against Saudi and Emirate facilities in just the past week.
This is not "possible pre crime".

Well, I'll be pedantic here: they couldn't ban it for that reason.  Circular logic fault.

No problem.  I wanted to ensure you (and other readers) didn't miss it.  I think it's important to correct when people spread misunderstandings.

Some people think BTC will reach $30,000 before the DJIA.
It's an intriguing thought...  can the cryptocurrency increase 5X in value before the Dow increases by 20%?

no, moron, it's strikes against the global oil trade, the nationality is irrelevant.
And yes, closing the oil trade through the straight will cause real humanitarian problems, and in fucking short order, too.
smh, why am I explaining geopolitics with an uninformed tool on a bitcoin reddit thread?  I am done with you.

Diversity of opinion among miners is a good thing, no?  We don't want all miners to suddenly say the reward must stop halving....

You said you can't spend Bitcoin like cash/has no utility.  I posted several examples of how I have used BTC in a way that has utility and functions as digital cash.

I think that the recent legal developments in the US allowing merchants to charge surcharges for credit card use will help people think differently about BTC.

Peer to peer
so hard to pick just one....

Only the largest of nation-states would have this sort of capacity now.  
China _might_ have that ability by hijacking all the mining currently done there.
But bitcoin mining is much, much more than even the largest single power production plants.  
It would take years.  I don't think a government could pull it off without the plot being exposed a long time in advance.
