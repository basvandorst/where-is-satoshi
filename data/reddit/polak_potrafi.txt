Yes, you are very right.
If he send 10k euro to someone by mistake.
And he asked this someone to return his money.
Than if that someone refused, than it would be an unrightfull possesion which is against law. And should be prosecuted.
If you get something by mistake and you refuse to give it back - you are a thief. This is how law works in most civilized countries.

I am sure last bull run was done by central planners - to pour printed fiat into cryptos and they almost killed it, selling it. And let it rot. Next crash might be even bigger: btc 200k usd and then crash sale it till 20usd. Let ppl go insane, let them kill each other fighting for reall btc while everything dies. Make their useless  cash be the main reason why ppl get interested in cryptos.
Watch Venezuela burn soon for trying to go toward cryptos.

Thats dumb.
If police got your stolen 10k usd car back, they give you the car back. They don't sell the car for 11k  and give you back 10k.
If yoy had 100 cars and 10 was recovered you get 10 cars back. How lame it would be for police to sell your cars and give you cash.
Change "car" to "daughter"... police comes to you and says "here is your 25k usd thats what's your 3 years old lost daughter was worth, we found her and sold her, have a good day sir"

10k satoshi for 500 byte tx and 4h waiting time to get 1 confirmation. Thats slow in my book.
Sure i could pay 4usd (100k sat) to move it faster. But paying more for btc tx than bank transfer is bad solution.
I dont know why you dont know what i am talking about. It is normal user experience from using bitcoin today. Maybe reading on reddit about btc and using btc differs.

For pension funds not to go bankrupt they should all allocate like 25% and if btc goes x10 than they will be saved, staying solvent. Or 5% and btc going up x50. 1% allocation would require btc to go up x250 times 25000%. anything less will not be enough.

If i repeat it 99 times each time with same result. I moved markets up by 400usd.  And stats will show 95000 btc sold 5000 btc bought. And market went up... just a misleading info.

Ok my conclusion about 1m btc in ln is probaly wrong. My point is that ln is a toy and btc onchain is getting SLOOOW.
Seems like btc on chain will soon be for 200+ usd tx ( because fees are going up, because tx amount is going up) while ln is for 20usd or less.
We might get gap for 20-200 usd payments.  Kinda the most used range by real life use cases.

Police,  bailiff, wife, court order, no one can take money from you. Sure they can kill or torture you, but if you won't allow, noone on this planet can steal your cash. (use only hardware wallets)
(ETH and smart contracts) You don't need to worry that your kids won't inherit your wealth after you die. You can delay payment of inheritance every year. Once you don't delay (death) your child's ETH addresses can get your wealth all at once, or maybe you can split wealth to be paid out every year - no one (no scamy judge, court, police, government) can undo your will.
You don't need bank/government permission to decide what your money can be spent on.

It says: you cant accept ln payment yet, because first you need to spend 15k sat to make room for receiving.
I did tip myself with 15k sat, and now it says I can accept only 1k satoshi. Hmmm. What now? I cant transfer more from tippin.me to my channel than there is free space inside channel.

Wallet of satoshi is still under development. Not ready to use.
Imho it will be best wallet for anyone expecting to receive more than send.
Wallet of satoshi allows to receive satoshis without spending them. Normally you need to spend 20k satoshis to receive 20k satoshis. You need empty space inside your channel to receive over LN.
Wallet of satoshis allows you receive more than you spend. No but we still have to wait for appntk be ready.
Think about your tip on reddit. Normally you cant withdraw the tip. For example you use bitcoin lightning wallet. You create channel, fund it with 100k sat. And you cant receive tip from reddit into your LN channel because your channel is full.
First you would need to spend about 14k sat + amount you want to receive.
Spending to receive isn't normally what shop would like to do.
Currently atm you cant withdraw any tip you got over reddit if you didn't spend first.
I think wallet of satoshis will allow it because it will be custodial wallet, so they owe  hash, but they also watch over your channel.
Preventing possible abuses. Normal LN abuse is A pays to B. B goes offline. A closed channel with state before A paid to B.
Since wallet of sathoshi acts as watchtower B  never goes offline makeing usage of LN  SAFE!
Actually not sure if blue wallets allows you to receive btc over ln without spending it first  - did anyone test it?

Hdd dont create transaction data send yo blockhain.
You need has to sign your transaction proving you own the coins. Trezer or ledger does it. They cteate transaction with signature created from private key.
When you use hdd than you have some app wallet on this hdd or yoh have private key writen there. But you still need to create transaction and sign it. You use computer to create and sin this transaction. If your computer is compromised it might crate fake transaction and send coins to wrong adress.
Trezor or ledger or HTC phone exodus- can create and sign transaction independent from computer which sends transaction over internet to blockchain node.
HTC exodus, has buildin trezor like device.
So no hdd wont help in anything.

BTC value is not based in USD.
BTC value depands from demand and withdrawal from exchange.
I'd you withdraw BTC from exchange you prevent rehypothecation of BTC.
Normally exchange can sell unlimited amount of btc to any user, expecting that most of those btc will not be witheawed.
In reality there is aym like 17m btc, but exchanges can sell 100m BTC - increasing supply, and effectively lowering price.
Most likely that's why cryptos were dropping down in 2018.

I am not sure if that's already possible atm, but by my understanding it should work like that.
Or you go to store pay with fiat and as change you get new LN channel connected to shops channel which you store in your phone and channel's data are saved in cloud.
After some time you end up with hundreds of channels and some app should be able to join them together or just do many ln payments if you want to buy something more expensive. Effectively closing channel after emptying it. Notifications should go up until the first channel created onchain.
Sure person creating sub channel and then trying to spend btc as if sub channel was not created should be somehow prevented by notifying event of creating sub channel to his   parent channel or in some other fancy sci-fi cryptographic way

200m people per year adoption looks really nice.
Not to mention that you might be getting phone one day personalized for you with funds already on phone, with channel already created for you. And you might join channel through centralized hubs without actually creating new channel.
Still IMHO 200m/year is more than enough.
Luckily there is LTC which can be atomic swaped with BTC.
So we get 800m/year on LTC and 200m/year on BTC.
Just 1 billion of ppl per year joining LTC/BTC LN looks awesome!

You can't call a wish to not be robbed of savings an anarchy. I think that currently we have tyranical regimes ruling pseudo democratical countries, rule of the junlge - stong one wins (banks) weak ones dies (citizens).
You can vote republicans or democrats, but bothhave same master - Banks. You think you are free, because you can choose who will steal your savings. That's a lie you are not free - you are slave. Slavery is evil!
I won't go into details that anarchy is really a rule of all, without leader - democracy of honest people should be anarchy. 
Anarchy is not the same as chaos, just no single leader.

You should be able to create channels inside LN not on chain.
LN owner can sell 10btc to 100m uses. Each pays 1 usd in some android/iOS app and each receives their own on channel.
LN inside LN sure it is not on chain and haha would need trust toward this LN provider. But maybe not everyone can afford real btc LN  channel, maybe not everyone need it.
Kinda like 100usd Amazon card works, it is not 100usd but you can buy stuff worth 100usd. Replace usd with satoshi and should be clear.
You can go further LN inside LN inside LN...
You get paid salary by getting access to channel with 10k satoshi. You are hiring maid she trusts you and she takes new channel from your channel that sits inside your company channel that got btc from governments channel.
When maid goes to shop she pays using the channel she got from you. And shop is big company and owns real channel on chain.
I mean you dont need to transfer btc off your channel you should be able to open sub channel inside your channel that would lock a bit of your btc inside this new channel.

Just create new wallet.
Legder scam looks like:
Someone buys ledger creates wallet and write down your "words" than they resell it, hoping that new wallet won't be created and they can use your "words" to restore wallet into their own ledger.
If you are suspicious just make sure you create new wallet.
By default ledger should come empty without any wallet on it. 
If there is one, just create new wallet.

Withdrawing coins you risk nothing, not withdrawing you risk losing them.
At best you are just lowering the price allowing exchanges to sell your coins and act as in  fractional reserves system.
 Do as you choose.
Not acting lowers price if your coins!
If you see delay in withdrawals you will see proof. Kinda easy.

Leaving coins on exchange you lower value of your coins. Exchange can lend your coins, your coins gets sold, buyer can leave your cryptos on  exchange. Those cryptos can be lend and sold AGAIN.
There should be mant ppl who thinks they own your crypto.  Thats why price is droping becaouse same 1 btc gets sold multiple times. 
Why can exchange sell your crypto multiple times? Because many ppl never withdraw those coins.
Not withdrawing you are hurting yourself and community. If you are really too dumb to withdraw just sell them and withdraw Fiat. 
Just check if you was robbed or not.

Well seems like kind cool idea if you dont store all your crypto on adress connected to this NFC card.
But keeping like 0.2 btc with lighting wallet for some small purchases, and authorizing phone app using NFC card might be cool.
What does it mean NFC has secured transmission? If transmission  is encoded what decodes it? Some app? What app?
 Does it only work with just some app wallet? What wallet app can be used with this card ?

You can sell fiat whenever you like. On exchanges you can't see how much your fiat is worth till the time you actually get on your public address for which you got private key. Once transaction is done you can see if the rate was real or not.

More info about LN in 1ml.com.
One that receives LN btc must be online all the time or at last once daily , payer must be online only while paying.
Generally it seems logical that ship stays online while they are selling products, and payer is online only at the moment of paying.
Capacity is like 550BTC.
Tx/s is infinite hmmm or more like depands how good you payment node is should be like 1k/s on avarage, good 12k usd server should do 20k/s.
If you use raspberry pi 3 it is 1.2 wat power consumption  per node per hour. I guess normal shop should create own node using raspberry cost is like 50usd.

It is not so obvious.
You can see price change without trades happening. Sometimes in all exchanges suddenly price goes up or down 1% on both sell and buy side without any trade happening. Who is deciding about the price change if there are no trades or hardly any trades.
If you are day trading and watching many markets you must have seen it more than once.

That's illogical. Is something is going up in value it is better to spend this thing rather than spending fiat. Let's say you got 4k euro and 1btc and you are spending euro. 1 dinner is 50 euro so you can buy 80 dinners. But if you dont keep 1k euro and you buy 1 more btc and this btc goes up to 8k you will be spending btc worth on a garage 6k euro. That way you can buy 120 dinners.
You end up with 80 dinners and 1 BTC or 120 dinners and 1 BTC.
Kind obvious it is better to buy btc and spend btc than just hold fiat and spend fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:17:37
Essential is not just HODLING but keeping your coins off the exchange, so exchange cant SELL you coins and buy lambos for theirself while plunging the price of your coins.
Get coins off exchange if you want to force exchanges to buy back the coins they sold!
If you want price to go higher just withdraw your coins from exchange.

It is not just about what if stock market crash or not. Most ppl know 2008 of Lehman Brothers aka Lehman Moment. While Lehman Brothers was just a miscalculation. 8+ banks got bailed out and one didn't because report said Lehman should be ok, it was just a mistake in raport. All top US banks should bankrupt in 2008 and on 1 week more most big banks all over the world should fail.
Question is will government bailout banks again and will taxpayers let it happen again especially if cost will be not 800b usd but 20000b usd.
I think there will be no next bailout,  than all banks will fail and all major fiat currencies will drop to 0, all stocks will be valued in btc. Oil, gas, silver,  gold all will be valued in btc. Nobody will wonder what is price of BTC in usd nor euro. Btc ltc dash and others  crypto should became the only working payment systems.
So the real question is will ppl allow next bailout. 
If in 2008 answer was no - billions would have die.
 Now we can say no and move to new financial system without billions dieing.
 Btc is the new alternative to archaic week and corrupted banking system.

Who said you need to pay someone transferring btc. You can pay creating new channel inside your channel. Sure new sub channel would have to possess proof that it was created from your channel and that your channel is legit, and that you locked x amount of coins inside this new sub channel.
It should be possible to verify that, the new channel not existing onchain was created by channel existing onchain.
I think one onchain channel could be split, off chain into billions of new channels.

I agree but it is close to impossible for usd to go to 0 in 1 day. It should last few years or months.  Definitely it is inevitable. Usd will fall.

Funny thing is you never had any btc, nor the exchange never got any btc. So how could you lose something you never had.
Weird that law thinks you had something or that you lost something.
Btc is inside blockchain you dont really own it. You just know fancy password allowing you to create signed transaction that will move  btc inside blockchain from one addresses to another.

Sure you can sue. Sometimes cases last many years.

Shop creates invoice for payment it opens automatically in electrum app with all details, I just put my wallet password, check all details for tx, click "ok" and payment is done, shop sells with 0 confirmations was super easy.
Shop is pyszne.pl www page that sells online food from like 400 restaurants.

If you get LN inside LN, than amount of users is infinite, scalability is infinite, tx/s is infinite. Well 2^200 or whatever it was.
You might think that one last step is far away or very close.
What worries me more is that you might guess someone's priv key.
There was like 5 or 10 keys broken using brute force, luckily they had less than 1btc total. Would look bad if one of them had 100k btc.
Priv  key  and public keys should be doubled in bits lengh to lower chances of brute forcing keys. Well we would get less tx/s but imho figuring out someone's priv key should be harder that it is atm.
