Hey world!
Sharing an update on [AirTM]( progress. 
Why should bitcoiners be interested in a cloud money app built on top of [Uphold]( ´s API? Well, because AirTM is as much a bitcoin app as it is an Uphold app. As we say in our most recent [blog post]( 


Back to the update. We announced AirTM [here]( five months ago and [launched in Argentina]( three months ago. Since then we’ve been receiving feedback from our clients and cashiers and improving AirTM accordingly, adding features and preparing to scale.
We’re proud to announce that AirTM is now open to the public in Argentina and Venezuela, and in invitation-only beta in the US, China, and Mexico. We expect to be open in five more territories by the end of the year (Aruba, Colombia, Panama, Brazil and Turkey).
AirTM’s growth and expansion into new territories wouldn’t be possible without our [development team] ( in Braga Portugal, Uphold’s awesome support and partner success team led by Byrne Reese, and all the investors who participated in our first round of financing (led by Cloud Money Ventures).
If anyone has any questions about building an app on top of Uphold’s [API]( our experience with raising money, or how AirTM works with bitcoin, please feel free to post questions in the comments section.
For anyone who wants to learn more about AirTM, here’s [an explainer video]( an  [article]( written by a happy AirTM client in Venezeula, and an [article]( that appeared in Cointelegraph.
Let freedom reign!
