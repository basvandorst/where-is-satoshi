The supply will shoot up for gold, that is sure....but not in our lifetime.  That's for our children's, children's, children to worry about.

Why would you be on this forum if you think BTC will fail?

By this logic, Gold has the same demand weakness. I also actually doubt BTC will be used for payments, anymore than gold is in the short to medium term.  It is a store of value first and foremost.

hahahha thanks for the laugh :) But it also is something to consider.  Thanks!

Thankyou!! I knew someone out there would be able to dissect it.
I just read it - very technical stuff.  I was hoping for something that normal people could understand :(

He's trolling, not going to engage. Best of luck with everything!

I agree but I also don't want to derail this into a BTC vs Gold debate.  Gold has an amazing track record, so does BTC albeit a shorter one.
Still curious about how the model above falls down (excluding extraneous factors like govt intervention, demand decreases, chain hacking or EMP blasts hahaha etc).

Dude thank you so much! That was pretty cool, instantly showed up in my lightning wallet.  A few too many steps, but I like that. Means we are very early adopters and can see the future where this is all seamless.  I’ve actually been in crypto for years but never really ‘used’ it.  Future is closer than we think!

The setup wasn’t an issue, but filling the lightning wallet from my bitcoin wallet took time (same as it does any BTC transaction). I don’t really want to store a lot in lightning wallet. If I did then yeah this would not be a problem. But I suspect people’s lightning wallets will only store small amounts, instead of being people’s entire crypto savings. 
Kind of like how I use Starbucks app, I only fill it $50 at a time. If that took 1-2 hours to fill, I wouldn’t use it.

Thanks jeffjefferson3000!! This is kinda addictive.  Crazy to think you could be in China/Russia/America/Africa and you just sent across 100 satoshis to me halfway across the world very very easily because of a reddit post = great use case for BTC.  I setup bluewallet as well to test around lightning - has a nice design too.
