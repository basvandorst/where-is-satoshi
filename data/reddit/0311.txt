I'll sell you some of my BTC for gold.

You probably mean "delve," because what you said doesn't make any sense.

Let me delve some information to you, buddy. I was divulging through the subreddit, and I found that none of them are ever wrong about anything. Anytime something seems to prove them wrong, it is actually incorrect and the person delving it to them is a liar.

Oh, yeah, that totally makes sense.
Who could have ever guessed that a conspiracy theorist wouldn't have a firm grasp on English? Also, I'm absolutely astounded that you replied to me correcting you by doubling-down on your bad grammar and trying to insult me. You guys are usually so ready to accept facts when they prove you wrong.

TSA: Is that a hardware wallet? I'm confiscating it.
Me: oh...ok...guess I'll order another one so it'll be at my house when I get back. You can toss this one.
Right? Or are they saying they're not going to let you into the country if you have a crypto wallet on you? I'm confused.
EDIT: Or maybe they want you to declare it the same way you would declare a large amount of hard currency? But that doesn't make any fucking sense. I don't have to tell customs how much money is in my bank account just because I'm carrying a debit card.

More plausible than the world being flat but only slightly less retarded.

If I hit $50k I'd retire to Panama.

Those people are retards.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:38:57
Pretty sure he's joking.

Sounds like great advice provided that BTC constantly increases in value forever.
I don't think anyone knows what's going to happen.

This guy doesn't know what empirical or wisdom mean.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:17:23


~~lol, no, you dumb motherfucker, I meant "mean". You don't know what wisdom means. You don't know what empirical means. You don't know what wisdom or empirical *mean*. Do you know where your brain is? Do you know where your asshole is? Do you know your brain and asshole *are* in the same place?~~
Huh. Turns out he's right. I did mean means. Still a dumb cunt.


This has got to be a troll. Make a new account and try again, retard.

Gold has intrinsic value.  BTC does not.  There is no guarantee that BTC prices will always rise when the dollar falls.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:00:29


Not really.

Sort of, but there are some big differences. No government is all of the sudden going to say, "no one can buy Apple stock anymore" but they might with crypto. Also, you can look at Apple's quarterly earnings and other news to get an idea of how it's going to perform; crypto prices are currently (mostly) driven by speculation IMO.
