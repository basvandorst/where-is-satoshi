I wonder why downvotes. It gives people false sense of security if people think it's anonymous.

I would pray if I believed there is a god out there. Now I'll just hodl.

I just want to clarify that value itself is not set by ECB, but fx markets (fx trading market is HUGE). They just control the interest rate (also called as monetary policy). Generally high interest rate makes the currency stronger and low interest rates weaker.   Their strategy is based upon an assumption that monetary stimulus will just shift Phillips curve upwards and thus rise inflation and so their only official target is to just keep the inflation rate at stable 2% using the interest rate.
Fiscal stimulus of recent years was first highly attacked idea in ECB when financial chrisis started. People just started to think that the whole system was about to collapse and so the original official target was sold out under political pressure.

Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Don't be bothered about the volatility.

In that case you should star hedging in some point with real bitcoin. You may read about delta hedging. Commonly used with equity options.

We already got more than -80%. The bounce started few months ago.

You should watch this: 
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:30:01
4500USD it at risk. If price goes up above 50k, his reward is (price-50k)*30. If bitcoin goes to 100k, he gets (100k-50k)*30=1,5m.
You can think call option like reverse insurance. Put option is like insurance: you pay premium and if price goes down, you get paid. In call you pay premium and if price goes up, you get paid. If it doesn't, you lose your premium.
I think the trader got good price considering the high volatility (gut feeling). Someone sold his &gt;50k upside for 1,875÷ annual return. Propably a miner.

Many here think fiat is worthless, but still accept their paycheck in fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:33:31
Already did.
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:02:07
1,875% for call @ 50k. Not that bad. No downside but that 1,875% and full upside if we start reaching the moon. That 4,5kUSD is absolutely peanuts though.
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:49:01
This :) Absolutely no news.
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:52:30
He never actually lost them. The wallet just were not able to see them in sub address.
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:46:36
Couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:10:46
It was not technical analysis :)

My hands are shaking as I'm buckling up since the rocket roars already. Get ready for 10G:s.
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:44:41
Check this out. They are talking a lot about store of value and offshore. They think Bitcoin @ 96k 2023. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:54:15
Been hodling since aug 2017. It has helped my balls to get used to a rough ride.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:33:21
Same. It will be all over the news when it breaks 10k again.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:02:39
10k here we come :)
@_date: 2019-05-28 09:14:54
Not at all. I can barely hear the whispers.
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:19:05
Pretty good writing.

Yes, I'm sure goldsilverbitcoin.com is in their top 3 news sources on average.
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:35:41
I think this is the most accurate answer.

Yeah, they are pretty deep. Read their other papers as well. I like the fact they also understand the scale of things like offshore. It's huge, it's 25% of the worlds wealth. If that starts moving, we are talking about tens of trillions of dollars:

Differences between individuals are huge. It depends for example: 1) if it was university of applied sciences or real university 2) master's vs. batchelor's (I didn't know jack yet @ bachelor level) 3) if their major was finance vs. something else 4) if one is interested about corporate finance or more mathematical stuff. Corporate finance people specialize in company valuation and stuff.

I think it's great to see the media coverage, since there is a lot of big money that watch these channels. These news indicate new investors incoming. That increases demand which in turn rises prices. They don't know anything but it's beneficial for Bitcoin that they are shouting it's name.

Privacy and fungibility.

We are now planting the seeds yes, but this is nothing yet. Last time when we hit 10k people just started to really talk about it in my work place and @ 20k it was on everybody's lips. Right now, its completely quiet. Nothing, absolutely nothing. The last time I've heard word "Bitcoin" here was some early 2018. And I work in finance where people are way more knowledgeable about anything that is related to money than average Joe.
Trust me, it hasn't even started yet. We need first hit 10k before press starts to really catch up, but I'm quite certain we need to start approaching 20k before it starts to trigger action. We are all biased here, because we follow these kind of headlines. Normal people are still completely in sleep.

I noticed that as well after posting this, it just felt like capitulation and took so long :)
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:23:23
@_date: 2019-05-25 06:46:10
That won't be the whole truth though. The most knowledgeable people work behind the scenes. The ones with customers are sales people.
@_date: 2019-05-28 09:38:28
I think the point these are interesting is that a whole army of huge fat whales are watching these having 0BTC yet in their portfolio. You probably haven't even seen that kind of whales. Those are eating normal whales for breakfast.
Bloomberg especially is kept in high value in finance sector.

I locked my coins because I knew how stupid I am. Saved myself probably from a big hassle.

I guess there should be another sub like bitcoininternational. I'm not from english speaking country either, but I think it would be weird to post here somehing that only small marginal will understand.
