I would say the encryption itself SHA256 is what makes bitcoin safe from forfeiture. Its a matter of P = NP. Once you encrypt anything like this, there is just not enough computing power to crack it. Somebody wrote a great article on the computing power it would take to crack SHA256 and it is said the heat generated would boil the ocean!
So as long as you own the keys and are not being waterboarded, your money is safe.

I agree. People need Bitcoin to be easier than going to a bank or using a credit card. Anton Antonopolous makes the point that it is actually more convenient to people in the developing world to use bitcoin. And then you have citizens who need bitcoin in order to protect themselves from governments and banks. US first world people are very much in the ivory tower.
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:07:09
Bitcoin could be used very effectively in this way. There very well could be a run on the banks. Trouble is people would not know what to do with their money. I think Bitcoin could play a massive role in funding legislation as well. People can come to rallies with giant QR codes ready to take donations for just about any cause. Ultimately I the current way people bank is by todays standards obsolete. To quicken the pace of adoption would be a tremendous blow to the banks and the IRS.
In my opinion a lot of this is happening naturally, but I'd be very excited to see Bitcoin start to take form as an economic tool to fight against the current structure.

It is both. I'm out until Bitcoin gets it's act together. I don't even care how they do it. All I know is that other blockchain tech are making big moves to improve their usability. I think Bitcoin might lose its position if they can't be agile. If they really want consensus, maybe they should focus on building a voting mechanism, that will instantly trigger a fork. THey need something better to facilitate consensus.

Well bubbles are not artifacts of no origin. Each one have special conditions attributed to it. I'm not scarred because I think now that the ETF is around the corner, and the idea of private blockchains have been squelched, this is perfect forming ground for a major growth in support. Think of all those wealthy people who now know blockchain technology is inferior to Bitcoin. Soon as that ETF has the green light, an insurmountable flow of money will enter the sphere from those very traditional investors.

This is a sign of adoption. This audience are the first adopters, among the masses. They are the conservative people who would call you crazy for buying Bitcoin, until Nasdaq, the Times, or Wall st Journal legitimizes it. 
i say this because, the more I watch the media, it becomes easier to see that, people are given permission to their opinions based on what is or is not condoned by the media. Bitcoin is now starting to be permitted.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:39:42
Yes but only the fiat accounts are. Bitcoin is property and not money according to the government. Maybe you can take an insurance policy out on your bitcoins. I don't know.

You can lower your regular amount and buy in to the dips. That will lower your average.

What I do is dollar cost average, buying once every two weeks automatically. Sometimes I buy more when I think the price is low. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:56:10
This is very true. Not until Bitcoin provides a better service than traditional banking, it will always be just nerd money. By and large people don't care how stuff works, when it works well. Bitcoin needs someone to develop a product that makes bitcoin more worthwhile than fiat banking. With that, the other big thing stopping mass adoption is the tax burden inherent to those who use it like a currency.

There's nothing unethical about how you manage your personal finances verses the quality of your journalism. So long as there's Paul Krugman, I wouldn't feel conflicted over writing favorably about Bitcoin. People need to understand crypto currency. It's right now uncharted territory, and if you can help people understand it better than that's a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:08:25
"Don't panic it's just the Chinese again!" Is always a perfectly acceptable answer on r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:35:06
All I'm saying is if you do log in, put your balance in the vault or even better your own cold storage. Hot wallets on the exchange are vulnerable.

I think these articles are exaggerated. Talk to any average person in India, China, Venezuela, Greece and I'm willing to bet most have not heard about bitcoin.

I say you can't change the nature of the Chinamen.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:11:45
Actually no. Once the big time investors get the ok from the regulators to use Bitcoin in their portfolios, a massive influx of capital will be flowing in and out of Bitcoin which will make the price go higher.

I don't think it needs a protocol change. Like smart phones, email, and airlines though they all improved the way people, communicate, travel, or post. My point is for your average person to change the way they bank, it needs to be remarkably better than the current mode. Here in America we don't need bitcoin as much as other places.

I think, it is wise to keep 90% of your savings (any money you don't need over basic monthly expenses) in an asset of appreciating value. Whether that's gold or whatever is up to you.

@_date: 2017-01-06 23:32:21
Whether fiat is recorded on a public blockchain or not is a good point. It still doesn't fix the inherent flaws of fiat. The dollar will still be a depreciating currency, and with a public blockchain it will be evermore controlled. That alone will force people in to the protection Bitcoin offers.

@_date: 2017-01-08 00:12:21
Yeah stuff like that has got to be remedied before anyone believes in mass adoption. Truth is, most are not responsible enough to handle their own money.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:07:40
The other thing to consider is the tax burden of going full in on Bitcoin. Say you had a Swish card to do your daily purchasing. Every time you load your card you are subject to a capital gains tax. So on top of the sales tax you are liable for that, unless Bitcoin loses value. In which case, you'd be able to declare a loss o your taxes. In the end, I think the complicated tax liability is not worth the headache for most people.

@_date: 2017-01-03 02:16:23
The vast majority of illegal activities are done in cash. That is a fact. The allegations that crypto currencies are used primarily for tax evasion and "drugs" is not true. If the powers that be cared about stopping tax evasion they would just have to read the panama papers. They won't though. Probably because they'd have to throw all our Congressmen and lobbyists in jail.
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:06:06
I am hopeful for the next wave of innovation on the internet. The internet of value. The decentralized version of the web. I think Bitcoin will mature as things like OpenBazaar a Bitcoin version of air bnb, things like that take root. I don't believe it will replace the dollar, but hopefully it can help retain value better so people are not forced to only trade in fiat. I expect this adoption to take hold within five years and the price should go up with it.

I've read that $800 mumbo jumbo before. Most people I talk to have psychological resistance about the price being too high.

Yes you should buy. Buy and hold as much as you can and figure out how to make Bitcoin your predominant savings account. What I'm saying is don't just invest. Make this currency your primary currency. Even if or especially if you have not much to lose. Game changers like this don't happen often.

If Bitcoin does turnout to be say the ultimate world bank created by the current overlords, it will be the death of anonymity and personal sovereignty of all peoples. All coins and transactions on the internet of value could be monitored by the technocrats which is precisely what the Trilateral Society wants.

If I were you, I'd make one wallet per coin, or half coin. You can always test the wallets by sending and receiving small amounts to each. In the end you can have several paper wallets with the same amount of BTC on each to store away for safe keeping and future use.

That is so arbitrary. A 14 billion dollar market cap is plenty sufficient to begin talking with Airbnb. It would be easy for them to implement bitcoin as a payment method.

I would rather not lie. If I have to pay taxes that's alright by me. I just wish the process were easier. I don't sell anyway though. I'm hoping to hold out long enough until mass adoption. Do you need to pay taxes if the property appreciates even if you don't sell?

With segwit and lightning, I don't even think we'll need exchanges. At least not for alts.

So you can sell Bitcoin, but cannot withdraw your fiat?

The computer and barrel is interresting, but why the homeless guy sauntering around?

You can always buy Eth until this all blows over.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:02:25
Should prbably jump before everyone else does and get a nice leg up in ETH.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:38:15
A wise move. Chinese exchanges begin trading Eth today.

Between taxes and network fees, you wont have much left to buy a space suit.

Yeah conformation times are bad, but the fees. I just don't think Bitcoin has done well maintaining its intended purpose. It shouldn't be so expensive.

True. Also hodlers are more likely to learn when to make really good moves ever. Like taking profit at ath and buying more a little lower one day.

I'm willing to bet most "traders" here are unsuccessful. Good traders are not squalking about TA and whatnot on ethrader.

Gnt and Icn would be me best bet for a 2x in about 1 month.

If scarcity had anything to do with value, wouldn't that be reflected in the price?
