I also obsessive personality, i think. Also can´t stop thinking about bitcoin... Going out with people that don´t care about btc and that will tell you to shut up about it, will be good for you.

About that, someone told me that you should not check the public address because you are exposing information making that address less secure. 
It doesn´t make sense to me... aren´t all the addresses that have bitcoin already easy to check by default because the blockchain is transparent?

@_date: 2014-11-17 19:25:37
You guys are nice, thank you, i´m a ignorant and scared user. :)
I already have the qt, but is configured by default. In that case i am not helping the network, right?
So, if i open port 8333, i´m taking any kind of risk, virus or something?
 I would like to do my part. Fuck the banksters and bring financial freedom for everybody.

Govts are attacking bitcoin and encryption because they want to control. All they want is power and control over the population. Terrorism is good for them.

At a certain point, the impossibility to get fiat out of India will make mining in India profitable.
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:22:31
It was a mistake of course :)
@_date: 2015-07-18 21:41:02
It´s an interesting article.
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:48:40
So, what would you do if you had a bitcoin qt version before  v0.9.5? Can you update and remove the coins to another wallet with confidence?

I just run bitcoin-0.10.2-setup.exe with the qt still there, or do i have to delete bitcoin qt? Can´t i just update bitcoin qt and remove the coins from there to another wallet like a bitcoin core in another pc or electrum?

I tried to understand 2008 and the financial system, so eventually i got to the the question: "What is money?".
When i really understood the concept, and the implications of a humans having to power to manipulate the ledger... i became a gold bug for a few months. Finally, after studying bitcoin many hours i became a bitcoiner! And i never been so excited about anything (except sex, drugs and rock and roll).

good article dude
@_date: 2016-07-23 00:12:17
Every news i see, that coinbase is involved, feels like they are the opposite of bitcoin. This one... ok, if there was a court order fine. But they do feel like any other multinacional corporation...
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:22:59
