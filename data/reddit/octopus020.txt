Almost eveything fails with kimble        if you at his history almost all his companies failliet
Megacar. Megabox/baboom.trendax.kimvestor and so on
Only megaupload worked and mabe mega but they still lose money. 
What a guy ��
@_date: 2017-01-24 12:46:05
Im curious what his investors think?  Are there here mu2/bitcache investors?
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:59:57
Is it not that megaupload was also big part succes because of bram Van Der kolk and mathias ortmann and some others ? 
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:57:21
I must say that you have a couple points �� that usa is a bit of Bully thats True   but kim was really not so succesfull till megaupload that was the key to instand succes and rich dom he earnt many many millions abouth 40 a year for couple of years but it was really on the line

@_date: 2017-01-24 21:33:06
Its not that if you cheat People and have them money that you are succesfull     you are succesfull if you earn it in a fair way

and sorry for my not so perfect English its not my native language 
@_date: 2015-02-05 10:45:56
I feel sorry for him, he seems a friendly Guy in the netherlands he would be free by now     grazy punishments in the usa
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:34:09
I don't say that he don't deserve a small push but 20 years or more is tottaly grazy in my eyes     give him a community servise of a moth and take his money   that should be enough
