Is he talking about a 51% attack?

Online wallets can have great features, but you won't be able to spend anything if the servers go down.
You also don't have control of the private key.
If the security of the site is compromised, you can lose your bitcoins.  I'm sure they have more security than the average individual, but I personally like to be responsible for my bitcoin wallet.

Apple has always butted heads with apps it didn't like.
Google Voice had the same issue for around a year until Apple finally came around.  I think legal action even had to be taken by google.
I never got Apple products mostly because of this.  They've pulled this crap from the start.
Expect bitcoin apps to exist on iOS in the future, but it will take some time.

I think they have certain locations in major cities where you can send parcels without having to give an address, anonymously.
You get some sort of code and can then pick it up.

P2pool is decentralized, so if enough people use it, it will be virtually impossible for mining pools to achieve 51%

Virtual implies it is not an actual currency somehow.   That's not what we want to promote.

Investing in a coin sorter and roller ($15) seems more convenient to me.  You also get the benefit of knowing how much change you have.

I'm getting a bad feeling from that line.  Like they're working on a middleman, PayPal like service in order to use bitcoin with them.
@_date: 2014-01-16 13:16:24


Paypal? Or am I thinking of eBay?

On a certain level, posting in one of the already created threads has lost some of it's potential impact since there are so many.  
You can't count on every subscriber to open and read all 20 threads on the subject and contribute to discussion in each.  At a certain point, users will just scroll down the page and read titles.  The way OP posted is probably the best way to get out information right now, other than if a mod stickied an official discussion post.
OP just isn't helping the problem, like you said.  Discussion is decentralized and all over the place.

Email them this.
I'm planning on buying a 120Hz monitor in the near future and feel the same way.  If they adopt bitcoin that would be enough to push me over the edge to finally get one.
An email is more likely to be seen by them.

Right, billing address.
I assume you wouldn't have to provide one when paying with bitcoin, which is what OP is saying would mean anonymous purchases.

They don't seem to be counting bitcoin donations in the top 10 donations list
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:30:30
Unfortunately, they're the only donation option for the video game speed running marathon event for charity, Awesome games done quick. 
There have been a lot of discussions on changing the payment option (a lot of them talk about bitcoin) but it comes down to the decision of the charity of the month as to how donations are made.

why does it take balls?  is his safety compromised now that he's pissed a few people on the internet off; which is exactly what he was trying to do.
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:18:14
Here's my understanding of mining, mining pools, p2pool, and 51% attacks.
P2Pool allows people to work together without sharing power.  The problem with traditional mining pools is that the admin / owner of the mining pool holds the power of everyone in it.
In order to do a 51% attack, you have to control 51% (or just over half) of the total mining power of all people mining bitcoin.  This is tough to do because you have to be ridiculously rich to own that much computing power (I'm personally assuming trillions of dollars).
And like I said, P2Pool decentralizes the mining power so no one can control it.

Have you made the code available for this project?  I'm interested in making one of these.
