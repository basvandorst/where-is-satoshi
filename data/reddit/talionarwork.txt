We launched on mainnet today. Somebody just spotted it a bit earlier than we expected and made an announcement faster that us :) BTW - we have testnet label on our logo if you will go to testnet version. Maybe we need to make it more clear.
About wallets - we have "mainnet" labels for wallets which are already launched on mainnet, so if you unable to see them then something is gone wrong. It will be really great if you can PM me about this so we will investigate!

Hey! Sad to hear that :( We definitely have liquidity issues from time to time, but we are trying to keep service uninterrupted and we will really appreciate if you will write to our support chat in that cases and describe briefly what was broken!

Yep, you are right in general. It is faster and cheaper (or equal) to just rebalance your existing channel instead of reopening. And I think if you have not so many channels and close them from time to time this can influence your node reliability rating that I believe currently used by lnd autopilot to automatically connect to nodes.  
And also you can do this with altcoins if you have any so it will be even faster and cheaper than with onchain BTC transactions ;)
