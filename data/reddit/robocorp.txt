What yes, we all remember that time the price went back in time. I think the quantum superposition prices gave even the most experienced Holders a run for their money.

Transacting != Banking. Yes, you can use Bitcoin to send money without the banks, but people don't only use banks to move money. Banks also serve as a form of insurance on the wealth you have. Many bitcoin holders don't take an issue with holding large sums in their personal cold storage, but the common person would probably want to have a bank hold that for them, as they're used to the safeties that a bank provides (mentioned earlier in this thread). Holding your life's savings in hardware wallets in safes isn't too far off from holding it in cash in safes. I'd conclude by saying that Bitcoin is like an upgraded cash. It allows you to send money anywhere. While it does directly compete with institutions like VISA to a degree, it doesn't necessarily have to compete with the idea of banking itself.

Give them a wallet that used to have something in it but no longer does.

I very seriously doubt Bitcoin will replace banks, personally. I believe that the banks would live on transacting Bitcoin instead of USD should it be adopted. Adoption doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Bitcoin if you're trying to replace banks, but it's trying to replace the dollar itself, which is a whole nother can of arguably even more difficult worms.

Drugs don't have to be valued as money to be "adopted."

While he absolutely could have, there is no proof of him having doing so. Just like there is no proof of me having doing so. The argument he is making is that eatmybit has no authority to just say that without some degree of evidence.
