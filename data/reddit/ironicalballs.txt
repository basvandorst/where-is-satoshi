The only way out is BTC. Each BTC becomes ticket out of Mt. Gox. Other exchanges are solvent and there is no added 'feature' in those BTC. 
BTC in Mt. Gox are worth gold. USD is worth 50% or less on Mt. Gox. Euros and JPY users are making a killing on arbitrage.

1. Japanese citizens take advantage of arbitrage, and withdraw in 1-7 days. They are currently buying cheap Bitcoins and selling them to USD Mt. Gox users escaping at a HUGE mark up.  There are Japanese citizens making $300 per day doing this on 2. USD users of Mt. Gox evaporates in 1-3 months to 0.01%. Only EU and JPY.
3. Price of Mt. Gox falls bellow Bitstamp/BTCe as it's only a EURO/JPY index.
It's basically, BTC China in reverse. People will be paying premium to escape Mt. Gox and in the end the price will collapse once everyone is gone. BTC China, the priced collapsed, then BTC China ran out of BTC/had loads of fiat and the few BTC remaining increased in value.

"JPM has quietly been accumulating a substantial amount of eligible physical gold (even as its registered gold inventory is the lowest it has ever been at just 87K ounces since December 13, 2013 when 147K ounces of gold was withdrawn - keep that date in mind for a few minutes)? This may have something to do with it: moments ago the daily Comex gold vault report confirmed what many expected, namely that the JPM accumulation was merely in advance anticipation of major withdrawals. How major? Well, on January 23, JPM saw 321,500 ounces of gold depart in one day. This was tied for the single biggest daily withdrawal in history!The last time JPM had an identically sized withdrawal? December 13.... 2012."

All of the above.
Bitcoin's market cap was only $4-5 Billion before things started getting out of hand. 
A Fidelity fund manager manages $1 Billion USD. . . just one guy at a station is in charge of $1 Billion. To show how small BTC currently was (and still is). 
So this volatility is mainly due to the current infancy and small cap of Bitcoin. Back when Bitcoin was $1 dollar, it would double in a single day to $2 and drop again to $1 back when BTC had a market cap measured in $ millions. 
Solution will only come with wider usage and larger market cap so whales can't affect the price as much unless a bigger whale comes along.

Head start advantage. This is a different issue entirely.
Windows OS marketed itself first in a major way and developed a wide user base early on. Bitcoin marketed itself first in a major way and developed a wide user base early on.
If you combine the competitiveness of Bitcoin with it's head start advantage, it's a good recipe for success. A JPMorganCoin has no head start advantage and it will probably not be competitive merchant wise.

Nothing is stopping you from converting your savings to BTC, and moving to Japan, HK, Korea or Singapore. 
If the United States wants to fight BTC to the bitter end, then get out of dodge. Really, that's a sign of a dying country. Defending old corrupt systems in exchange of scaring away new jobs, new tech, new services in the form of BTC related businesses.

Bitcoin needs to stop focusing with speculation, spot price of BTC and Chinese liquidity increases and focus on creating wider network externality by bringing in more merchants into the Bitcoin space. China circle jerk at Inside Bitcoins was beyond annoying because it only focused on BTC as Gold 2.0 commodity. 
There was not nearly enough focus on. 
* Making Better Coinbase/Bitpay Apps and Merchant Tools 
* Making Bitcoin wallets dumbass proof so consumers can use it at BTC accepted stores and feel secure using BTC wallets. 
Bitcoin badly needs to hitch to the Smartphone app space not only currency exchange space. So that "Joe" knows Bitcoin as that cool new thing people use on their smartphone that replaces VISA Mastercard, NOT that "volatile Internet money" which is often used to smear BTC. 
Bitcoin will be worth $10,000 per when Grandma finally figures out how to properly use a Bitcoin wallet on her Smartphone while going out to buy adult diapers at a grocery store that accepts BTC. Bitcoin will be only worth $500 by only begging more American people to invest more money into it.

Let's be honest, initially the PRC thought Bitcoin was Gold 2.0 (It is but its more than that) and a way to stick it to the USD.
However, BTC in China was basically used to launder money to the west where many Chinese expats are currently fleeing. CNBC proved that $650 Billion leaves China thru diaspora and that will double in the coming years as the health situation in China deteriorates. (8 year olds die of lung cancer).

The Chinese investor has never been a good champion of Bitcoin. 
And I never liked how China viewed BTC. Bobby Lee pretty much peddled BTC in China as Gold 2.0. Not figuratively, but literally. He told them to buy and hold BTC, while westerners love Bitcoin for its utility to be used to replace Credit cards by merchants. And are always trying to build the BTC user base and infrastructure. 
Lastly, Chinese are powerless against PBOC. The main reason why they are still poor is because they allow their PPP to remain so low so they are forced into low wage manufacturing.

When they do this, the Chinese state prevents them from taking more than $50,000 per year from their bank account at a time.
Bitcoin was speeding that up. 
* China has bigger problems than bitcoin. The rate that China's upper crust is leaving China is doubling year on year. The upper class in China either see the writing on the wall and that's China's economic miracle is coming to an end. HSBC trade and GDP numbers offen clash with that that state claims.  And/or they simply do not want to live in a country that gives them lung cancer with world record pollution and carcinogenics.
