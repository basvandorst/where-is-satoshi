You can ask a techie friend to help you set up a secure offilne computer to print your paper wallets. Do it right just that once and you never have to worry again.

Paper wallets.

But then you have an adress with 1 satoshi in it which cant be spent

Look I dont know if "scam" is the right word but I can tell you that I will never ever use Ripple for anything.

Hes just joking about the address
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:54:17
I guess roads, fire departments, health care and all that can fuck right off too, yea?

SD already adjusted to send 5430 satoshis to losers instead of their old 1 satoshi. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 05:52:43
Youcan do that on localbitcoins too

You can even send your change to a new paper wallet. Paper wallets are the shit! You only need a secure computer once, on the day you make and print your paper wallets. Print a hundred of them and you'll never have to worry again.

So noobs are gonna get RAPED on ripple. Awesome.

We don't need to alleviate shit! Inflation is bad. Deflation is good, thats why Satoshi designed it like this. Those who disagree can go back to hoarding their government currencies and see how that work out for them.

I dont think there are many universes in which it's worth 10k. Maybe 4k. Maybe.
