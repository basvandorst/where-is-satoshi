That's really weird, maybe you have to get a international debit? I don't even know if that exists but i really wish that by this time big tech companies would support a countries most popular form of payment. I mean its in their interest to make more money.

You can buy with a debit card too, which is like a credit card but instead of putting it through your monthly allowance(limit) it takes it from your bank account. Credit is big in this country.  You can be filthy rich, if you dont have credit history you pretty much have to pay everything with cash.

Holy shit, you just made me realize that all these "safety features" on everything really fucks up with human natural selection. Sure less people will die, but how many fucktards will survive?

Because of over simplification of things, lack of incentives for education, for profit corporation getting too big to the point of controlling the government, etc. Sure "safety features" could've been a factor , but not all because of it.

I'm not that into bitcoin, only have about 20$ worth, and its all on blockchain, am I doing something wrong and it can easily be stolen? I mean, for me having it on blockchain is great, it has an app on my phone and its all synched and I don't have to download 10 or more gigs of data to my pc, like with the wallet program.
