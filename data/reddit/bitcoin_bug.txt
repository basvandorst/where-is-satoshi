It Bitcoin doing that? No, bitcoin is just a tool. A tool to sent value over the internet (and more).

One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. 
Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

Bitcoin,com is just one more piece of evidence that shows that Roger Ver is more concerned with using politics to game the market than actually believing in the ideology behind the politics he pushes.

    There are three implementations: lnd (written in Go by lighting labs), Éclair (Scala, ACINQ), c-lightning (C, Blockstream). Importantly, there's a spec we've all been working on and towards. We're frozen now, and reach one is well over 90% complete.
    I expect implementations off test net this year, in alpha, maybe even beta. Then you can lose real money!
    Same as on-chain: businesses. Users pay the tx fees, and would you rather receive an inflating currency or a stable one? I know which is rather spend...
    I had stats on this, but off the top of my head we can reasonably add about 750,000 users per week. Maybe 1M with schnorr?
    I believe we'll need a gradual increase once we've squeezed all the efficiency out of bitcoin we can (and they are pretty huge right now, so there's much to do). But say with 17% per year, it's still easy to overshoot, and we need fees to pay miners in the long run. So we'll also need a soft cap (eg. based on proof of backlog).
    Fees will be a race to the bottom, I think. They'll be pretty token. Miners will be paid because they are the onramps and offramps, and cold storage isn't going away.

hey OP, i see your point but where is the SegWit adoption right now? Is coinbase already using SegWit?
You see that there is alot of improvement IF people want to improve it and use the tech which is available.

tltr: hodl and learn something about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:10:00


quicker? bcash transactions are as fast as bitcoin transactions.
and bcash transactions are cheap because noone is using bcash. you can do the same with Litecoin.
=bcash has nothing (except some criminal backers)
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:04:33
and money laundering.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:43:07
dont sell all your gold for it. these are very different assets. gold has a very low risk, bitcoin not.

of course you can. fees suck for small transactions. if you sent thousands or more it doenst really matter at the moment but small transactions make no sense.
but there are solutions to these "problems" and bitcoins future was never better in my view :)

@_date: 2017-12-14 09:32:13
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:29:43
very nice :) 
coinbase will add it in 10 years i guess (after they became irrelevant).
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:32:37
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:56:01
i guess the reason for that is, because that stuff is complicated and pumping a scam like bcash is easy, you only make some hollow statements and say "buy that, price will go up!"
for me, learning all that bitcoin stuff and looking in the future was the most enjoyable thing to do.

    is the most comprehensively tested Bitcoin scaling improvement of all that currently exist.
    enables up to 4 times more Bitcoin transactions in a single block.
    fixes Bitcoin transaction malleability problem.
    makes the Bitcoin Lightning Network upgrade much easier to integrate.
    improves security of hardware wallets.
    makes signature-hashing more efficient.
    reduces the ability of miners to use AsicBoost covertly, subsequently making mining a more equal competition between Bitcoin miners.

@_date: 2017-12-11 08:34:41
and it will, give it time (google for example "confidential transactions") or LN ransactions are never broadcasted, and leave no trace on the blockchain, offering privacy benefits. And with any luck, these privacy benefits will only continue to improve.

he is selling gold and silver. i cant believe he is that stupid, i guess he is just "defending" his business and defrauding noobs.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:33:09
he will create bcash 2
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:27:24
Bcash is Bcash and everyone knows this.
So when a coin name itselfs Bitcoin they will list 2 bitcoins because the altcoin says its the official source?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:11:30
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:16:02
i can tell you that the stock market is in a bubble and that will it will crash at some point.
i bet 1 bitcoins. you will see, iam a genius ;-)

@_date: 2017-12-26 15:07:37
One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. 
Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

Please downvote bitcoin,com spam! 
This website ist owned by the former politician Roger Ver (people call him "Bitcoin Judas"). He is expanding his influence with this and is attacking bitcoin since years. He even wants to install a Bitcoin CEO and tries to centralize the development of bitcoin. In upvoting this crap, you are helping Roger Ver with his plans to form Bitcoin in a centralized Shitcoin and hurting your own investment in a free bitcoin. Roger Ver sold most of his bitcoins and now holds large amounts of Bcash, ETH and DASH which he tries to pump.
His website buys old reddit accounts to post this spam.
Bought accounts:

Just one more piece of evidence that shows Roger Ver is more concerned with using politics to game the market than actually believing in the ideology behind the politics he pushes. He doesn't give a shit about bitcoin, freedom, privacy, individuality, or anything else besides money and power.

Someone out there just made a bet that bitcoin will surge above $50,000 next year, trading data show—about triple its current price.
Daily trading records released Wednesday by LedgerX, a startup electronic market for bitcoin derivatives, show that an unidentified trader or traders entered the bullish bets using bitcoin call options that expire next December. The trade wagering on a move to $50,000 was the first of its kind on LedgerX.
Just under $1 million was paid for the options in one or more trades that took place during the 24-hour period ending at 4 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, the records show. It is unclear from LedgerX’s data who the buyer or buyers were or whether the purchasing was done in multiple transactions or just one.
If bitcoin is below $50,000 on Dec. 28, 2018, the options will expire worthless, and the $1 million will be lost. If bitcoin rises above that level, the options will give their owners the right to buy 275 bitcoins for $50,000 apiece—a transaction that would cost about $13.8 million.
Such a trade could be lucrative if the digital currency skyrockets to $500,000 or even $1 million or more—something some of bitcoin’s most enthusiastic supporters say will happen.
The digital currency was trading at $16,280.24 late Wednesday afternoon, according to CoinDesk. It is up more than 1,500% from the beginning of this year, an extraordinary run-up that has unleashed a flood of investor interest. But skeptics such as Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz call bitcoin a bubble and say its price will inevitably crash.
LedgerX Chief Executive Paul Chou declined to identify who was behind the big call-options play, citing regulatory restrictions. But the scale of the purchasing reflects the mounting interest of hedge funds and other big financial firms in cryptocurrencies, he said.
“Without a doubt, there are institutions out there that are looking at these types of trades or have done these types of trades,” Mr. Chou said. “It’s not an individual, let’s put it that way.”
Bitcoin options have gained popularity in recent months as a way to bet on the cryptocurrency’s ups and downs. At Deribit, a Netherlands-based bitcoin derivatives exchange, an average of around 400 options contracts were trading hands daily in late November, up from 50 to 100 a few months ago, said John Jansen, the company’s chief executive. Deribit has started handling large, institutional-size trades, he added.
Traders have targeted bullish options that would pay out if bitcoin’s price spikes, Mr. Jansen said. Earlier this month, for example, one of the most popular bets at Deribit involved call options that would pay off for investors if bitcoin hits $20,000 by March.

Roger´s best friend. Just one more piece of evidence that shows Roger Ver is more concerned with using politics to game the market than actually believing in the ideology behind the politics he pushes. He doesn't give a shit about bitcoin, freedom, privacy, individuality, or anything else besides money and power.

dont use bitpay / copay, they are hostile against bitcoin these days.

OP gets it
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:53:39
One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

it is not about 2 mb blocks. make your research.

One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. 
Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

we will not see a 80% correction at this point anymore. 2013 isnt 2017.
2013 was kindergarden compared to 2017.
some days ago CME announced bitcoin futures, an ETF is on the horizon, goldman sachs wants to start btc futures/trading, we have hundreds of exchanges worldwide, next halving in 2 years.
of course there will be a correction, but not 80%.

yes, a 30% correction is possible but longterm trend is up.
some people here never heard of the halving - lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:14:44
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:30:50
75% is pretty unrealistic at this point because bitcoin has the attention of too many (rich) people (who will invest).
i would say 30-50% is possible.

The Bitcoin network has scalability problems. To increase
its transaction rate and speed, micropayment channel networks have
been proposed, however these require to lock funds into specific channels.
Moreover, the available space in the blockchain does not allow scaling to a
world wide payment system. We propose a new layer that sits in between
the blockchain and the payment channels. The new layer addresses the
scalability problem by enabling trust-less off-blockchain channel funding.
It consists of shared accounts of groups of nodes that flexibly create one-
to-one channels for the payment network. The new system allows rapid
changes of the allocation of funds to channels and reduces the cost of
opening new channels. Instead of one blockchain transaction per channel,
each user only needs one transaction to enter a group of nodes – within
the group the user can create arbitrary many channels. For a group of 20
users with 100 intra-group channels, the cost of the blockchain transac-
tions is reduced by 90% compared to 100 regular micropayment channels
opened on the blockchain. This can be increased further to 96% if Bitcoin
introduces Schnorr signatures with signature aggregation.

One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. 
Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

This website ist owned by the former politician Roger Ver (people call him "Bitcoin Judas"). He is expanding his influence with this and is attacking bitcoin since years. He even wants to install a Bitcoin CEO and tries to centralize the development of bitcoin. In upvoting this crap, you are helping Roger Ver with his plans to form Bitcoin in a centralized Shitcoin and hurting your own investment in a free bitcoin. Roger Ver sold most of his bitcoins and now holds large amounts of Bcash, ETH and DASH which he tries to pump.

we will not see a 80% correction at this point anymore. 2013 isnt 2017.
2013 was kindergarden compared to 2017.
some days ago CME announced bitcoin futures, an ETF is on the horizon, goldman sachs wants to start btc futures/trading, we have hundreds of exchanges worldwide, next halving in 2 years.
of course there will be a correction, but not 80%.
BashCo: did you sleep the last 5 years?!

"Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency polarizing governments, banks, and investors alike, has plummeted more than 25%, to around $3,580, from its early September peak of $4,950.72, according CoinDesk. The sell-off was largely driven by Chinese regulators formally shutting major Bitcoin exchanges.
It didn’t help that JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a “fraud” and “worthless” and that Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio called it “a bubble” in the days following China’s crackdown. Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Thomas Lee disagrees, saying that China’s recent moves are a short-term head wind, given that the region represents just 20% to 25% of global trading volume. Lee, in a recent note to clients, wrote that Bitcoin was “increasingly representing the gold investment” for millennials and will ultimately displace the precious metal in portfolios. He contends that Bitcoin could reach $25,000 by 2022, given that it accounts for 5% of the $7.5 trillion alternative currency market, which is growing by 6% annually. By early 2018, he sees it hitting $6,000, a whopping upside of 68%.
Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (ticker: GBTC), the only exchange-traded product that offers Bitcoin exposure, will capture much of that upside, says Lee. The problem: This is an exchange-traded note, backed by Bitcoin, and it trades at an astonishing 95% premium that has been as high as 125%. That means investors are paying twice as much, plus fees, to own Bitcoin—a premium that will disappear as the Bitcoin market matures and access becomes less of an issue.
That’s already happening. In July, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission unanimously approved LedgerX’s cryptocurrency-trading platform for clearing derivatives; it will start with Bitcoin options. CBOE Holdings and Gemini Trust, the digital currency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, announced a partnership to offer Bitcoin futures as early as this year. VanEck has filed to bring products holding Bitcoin “instruments” to market. Exchange-traded fund provider REX is planning two Bitcoin-based derivatives ETFs.
The SEC has rejected Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, citing a lack of regulation of the Bitcoin spot market; a derivatives market in Bitcoin would remedy that. It also doesn’t hurt that Dalia Blass, who hails from the law firm that represented the Winklevoss twins’ ETF, has been named director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management. "

This website ist owned by the former politician Roger Ver (people call him "Bitcoin Judas"). He is expanding his influence with this and is attacking bitcoin since years. He even wants to install a Bitcoin CEO and tries to centralize the development of bitcoin. In upvoting this crap, you are helping Roger Ver with his plans to form Bitcoin in a centralized Shitcoin and hurting your own investment in a free bitcoin. Roger Ver sold most of his bitcoins and now holds large amounts of Bcash, ETH and DASH which he tries to pump.

Roger Ver is okay as long as he can make more money with it. But for some people money is not the only goal.
Just one more piece of evidence that shows Roger Ver is more concerned with using politics to game the market than actually believing in the ideology behind the politics he pushes. He doesn't give a shit about bitcoin, freedom, privacy, individuality, or anything else besides money and power.

I oppose it because:
-because 2MB blocks are too large. 
-because the 2x software which has been released is unreliable.
-because it is an attempt to take control over the protocol
-because it is an attack

"should i put all my kids savings in bitcoin?"
OF COURSE NOT! to be more precise: it always depends on your situation but for 95% of all people, it is bad to put everything in 1 basket. so they made a conservative choice, nothing wrong with that. 
but putting at least 5-10% in bitcoin would have been clever.

    -Use BTCPay instead of Bitpay
    -Call Coinbase out in public on forums and twitter until they clearly mark the Segwit2X coin as BT2 or -B2X, and maintain BTC as the original chain's ticker.
    -Pull your coins out of Xapo and discourage people from using their service until they renounce B2X.
    -If you're running a full node, then run this script in order to ban 2X nodes.

"Wright’s mother had told me about her son’s long-standing habit of adding bits on to the truth, just to make it bigger. ‘When he was a teenager,’ she said, ‘he went into the back of a car on his bike. It threw him through the window of a parked car. That’s where his scar comes from. His sister accompanied him to the hospital and he’s telling the doctor that he’s had his nose broken twenty or so times, and the doctor is saying “You couldn’t possibly have had it broken.” And Craig says: “I sew myself up when I get injured.”’ What his mother said connected with something I’d noticed. In what he said, he often went further than he needed to; further than he ought to have done. He appeared to start with the truth, and then, slowly, he would inflate his part until the whole story suddenly looked weak. "

Just one more piece of evidence that shows Roger Ver is more concerned with using politics to game the market than actually believing in the ideology behind the politics he pushes. He doesn't give a shit about cryptocurrency, freedom, privacy, individuality, or anything else besides money and power.

From a purely body language perspective, he comes across here as anxious and vindictive / bitter. He is trying very hard to control his facial expressions and is visibly putting effort in choosing his words instead of speaking his mind. It makes him come across as insincere. Untrustworthy. Also there is a lot of sarcasm in his speech.

Order a Trezor or Ledger and buy 0.5 bitcoin. Use it, sent it back and forth. Learn more.
Invest a bit more if you are willing to lose all your money.

They are still early if they understand it within the next years i would say. I think alot of people here massively overerstimate the amount of people who heard of bitcoin. There are maybe 5-10 mio people who own crypto. The world has 7 billion people.

Let´s fire up more BIP 148 nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:24:08
Germany is a pretty poor place to buy bitcoin because you only have bitcoin.de (which is a joke). low limits and it is no real exchange.
you should use Kraken or Bitstamp instead.
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:09:46
We should ask miners for that.

that assumption brought us to the gridlock that we have at the moment. it is a poor assumption in my view. everything that is possible will be done, maybe just as a threat to achieve something.
