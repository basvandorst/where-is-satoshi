But they are regulated, so I can obliviously feed the fraud and pay no consequences.

Trees in computer science are the very same trees from graph theory, and the definition is pretty unambiguous about being an undirected graph unless you're specifically discussing a directed graph, e.g. when defining a unique root. "Computer science" is far too broad a context to assume the latter.

I don't see this working if they really lost 5% of the world's Bitcoin. The burden is just too great. But it seems like a reasonable plan if it turns out they are "only" missing e.g. 10k (and perhaps the rest were temporarily locked down by lawmen). I wouldn't be a customer, but I'm sure someone would.

I'm not sure how to respond to that...

I would have considered buying the Newsweek operation for $1.00 and taking on its $40 million in debt back in 2010, but not now. Not with this looming liability.

Err, I think he was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:52:28
Not once did he say "going forward" or "provide some color" or "strategic initiative" or "key player", which makes me trust him more than 90% of CEOs.

Well that's consumption while the excuse for inflation is investment. I.e. why would you invest in anything if your buying power is likely to grow 2% anyway? That's also bogus, obviously, or there would already be no investment in anything but the "safest" government bonds.

It's probably my misunderstanding of the bug. I thought it was causing MtGox to automatically re-send transactions when the expected IDs didn't show up in the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 12:46:01
According to the Daily Mail, this guy is the "Bitcoin boss". I don't know if that's above or below CEO, but you guys should show a bit more respect!

IBTimes is about as credible as Newsweek, Examiner, or the National Enquirer. And oh yeah, they own Newsweek, so it's not surprising they would use the relationship for damage control.

A better analogy would be going through a public locker room, randomly checking the doors to see if people hadn't secured them properly. If you remove some property from a locker *and* return it to the owner before the police are notified, then you might be in the clear and might even have prevented a real theft. But if the police show up while you still have the property, they're also going to call that theft.

Because it is presently not the future, yet.

I guess it depends. If they're stolen *but* eventually recovered, excellent. Otherwise, some thief or group of thieves will forever (if they're smart) control the fate of the currency and everyone who depends on it, which is no better than what we have now.

Without qualification, trees are usually undirected. If you have a directed graph that would be a tree if it were undirected, it's a directed tree (or just a tree if "directed" is understood in context).

I can't find fault with any of your complaints. IMHO Bitcoin got too much attention, much too fast, before all of the necessary pieces were in place. On the other hand, the attention is attracting investment and expertise that potentially brings solutions (needed: lending, decentralized trust/credit rating, insurance, trustworthy cloud backups, make it more difficult for non-technical users to mess up...). I just hope the problems can be solved algorithmically before they are "solved for us" politically and bureaucratically.

Which darknet should be more successful: the one named "Freenet" or the one named "The Onion Router"?
I like the gimmick aspect of news anchors having to say "free market", but what they'd more likely say is "the terrible scourge, called 'the free market' by its subhuman supporters who, in our unbiased opinion, should be rotting in prison ..."

Well, thanks for making the effort. It could have been an interesting thread. Even if you don't know much that the public doesn't know, every little piece helps to understand the puzzle that is MtGox.

To be fair, if you handed some money to a clerk at the biggest, most successful exchange and had your money sucked out of the clerk's hand by a huge vacuum cleaner, and it turns out that it has been sucking money with management's knowledge for so long that they have no ability to compensate you, I wouldn't blame you for failing to plan for that contingency. 
There must be some level where people can assume things are on the up-and-up, or society can't function. That doesn't mean politics and bureaucracy are the *only* or *best* way to establish order, but it's hard to move forward if everyone must constantly look over their shoulder and back-track to search every nook and shadow for bad guys.

Is there a quote of the lawyer specifically saying "stolen" or equivalent? The media get little (read: big) details like this wrong all the time. Permanently lost would be a hell of a lot better than stolen.

It would be unwise to underestimate the power/danger of statistical inference. E.g. a 60% probability that you were involved in a shady transaction is enough to cause some grief, even if you weren't involved.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:37:55
Hmm, if the coins really were drained over time through the malleability bug, I don't think the blockchain preserves a record of *which* transactions were involved, so proof may be impossible unless MtGox happened to keep unusually detailed logs.
