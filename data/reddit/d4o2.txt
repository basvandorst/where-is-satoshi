Glad to hear that more and more people can think and realise we are approaching an financial crysis, as sad as this may sound. With negative interest and stocks at an all time high and bonds already crashing it's just a matter of time.
Bitcoin will get many more adopters during this upcomming financial crisis because of its scarcity, security (in terms of algorithms) and novelty.

Basically anyone can agree that a specific individual satoshi represents $25000 or a property or a car and so on. Whoever is the owner of that agreed upon satoshi gets the benefit.
Think as altcoins but on the bitcoin blockchain, where a single satoshi is a coloured coin that can mean anything.
You still need to pay the tx fees, and the small satoshis representing the coloured coin.

@_date: 2015-06-06 20:04:28
The price was relatively stable at over 200$ during the last months. I can see it staying there or going to a minimum of 100$-130$.
That being said, now or in the very near future is the best time to get your bitcoins if you want to still hop on the last train of acceptable prices.
With so many investments and companies getting interested recently it's just a matter of time until the price will start its up trend. Remember, the price has been much stable this year than in the past. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:04:42

It's about time they updated the iOS app. Transactions showed as pending forever (despite showing as completed on PC), camera absolutely didn't pick up QR codes (other apps worked perfectly fine) and overall sense of being cheap and completely lacking in testing usability/functionality.
If you are going to go mainstream please make sure to have a working app. Bonus points for making it look good on iPhone 6 since SO MANY wallets are absolutely not ready for iPhone 6. And that change is very simple to implement (am an iOS developer myself).
EDIT: Scanning QR code still doesn't work after the update, other apps work fine and very fast.
EDIT2: For this, I am downvoting this post. I think i'm allowed to be dissapointed with a product aimed at people that couldn't care less about bitcoin's keys and just want an easy to use app such as Coinbase. I am fine with that, at least make it work.

If you want to introduce people to Bitcoin, now is the perfect time, when we have a strong support at over $200 that is like this for months after the big drop from the bubble and boom.
Chances are it will go up and your friends will not be dissapointed seeing huge losses as from the $1000 top to $200 these days.
Buy low, sell high!
And I know Bitcoin is not about its USD value, but when you put your money into it, you don't want to see that much volatility in price. Getting your friends in the game now is the best timing.
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:50:46
Because it is known beforehand and it's something expected it is assumed it is already reflected in the price.

Their customer service was very helpful when I did a mistake on my part. Because the amount was relatively small (something like $20) they offered to help me and "gifted" me the lost coins because I sent them to the wrong address.
I really recommend them, no KYC or other stuff like that. Plain and simple.

Don't worry. They just need to find the sweet spot where the things get balanced out.

I am not denying they lost some of their investment, but I don't think many Greeks bought Bitcoin as the country has tight capital controls.
The price was pumped artificially and then dumped by players with large pockets, while at the same time reflecting a worldwide hope in a new type of currency.

Check out Maidsafe. They are building a fully decentralized anonymous internet which will also have Safecoin (currently Maidsafecoin until work is finished) which will be the first cryptocurrency without a blockchain (making it fully anonymous and hard to track just as cash).

They are payment terminals that also support buying Bitcoins with local currency for a fee up to 10%.
You can then use the terminals to pay for your phone top up, electricity, gas and other stuff using Bitcoin.
The ATMs are almost everywhere (the locations are accurate) but as they support lots of stuff (not only limited to buying Bitcoins) most people don't know about the possibility of using them to buy Bitcoins.

I think we should express fees in BTC and not in USD. It is simple to do this as there is a limited numer of bitcoins in the economy and this should also take in the account that bitcoins will appreciate over time (hopefully). $10 in today's bitcoin ecosystem will not be the same tomorrow.

A very good article!

Don't worry, they were very helpful in the past and I'm sure you will get a reply here.

People find it weird when I tell them we should get paid for our time spent on the Internet. Our movements, searches and so on are so valuable for research in artificial intelligence we can't even imagine.

Because you buy such a large amount, they will get expensive. Mining will be a cheaper option to get bitcoins than actually buying them from an exchange. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:01:45
What wallet do you use? Most of them got an update where they automatically calculate the fees so it goes straight in the next block. Trezor, Breadwallet and others to name a few.

or an USB hub in which you stick your ethernet adapter along with an external hard drive

Show some respect for someone way more intelligent than you, that actually spoke to Satoshi Nakamoto.

They are "breaking" the usb cable, not the device itself. You will not know that your private keys were stolen minutes before.

Most powerful miner you say? The ATM near you. Will change your $50 in bitcoin in no time!

Thank you for the review. It look worse than I was expecting for the price, but it's great there's more competition in the market.

Kaiser, Kim. Can it bet any better than this? /s

so yeah, SN now needs donations to his new bitcoin address
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:50:35
Don't keep your bitcoins on a website. Instead, keep them in an offline storage such as a Trezor or a Paper Wallet.
If blockchain.info closes doors, you can't get your bitcoins back.
You can also use mobile apps for bitcoin wallets and rely on the security of your operating system and writing the back-up words to protect in case of theft.

A bit too pushy for my taste.
