An Australian exchange that doesn't charge 7.9% (or $10) per BTC would be sweet.
@_date: 2013-06-04 11:29:08
Australia always getting shit on by somebody in relation to bitcoin.
Forcing people onto rip-off merchants charging 5.9-10% per BTC. Not as a total, per BTC.

To buy: Use [Coinjar] ( - 2% fee
To sell: Use [Bittrade Australia] ( - 2% fee
Excellent to see that I'm not the only one mentioning Coinjar (*I'm also not affiliated with Coinjar, I too am sick of being done up the ass*)

I should update my tip: Buy Coinjar (2% fee), sell on BitradeAustralia (2% fee).

@_date: 2013-04-12 12:30:31
Yeah. It is a *fucking* joke how we're being bent over by exchanges here.
It's more often than not, double. Whoever builds an exchange without relying so heavily on international assistance in the way of BTC reserves &amp; charges a fair fee with a legitimate looking site + security: will get respect.
So many attempts at an Australian exchange have been more than pathetic. It's been embarrassing and confirmation on why the world gives us the finger in regards to accepting Australian deposits. They just don't care, we're not important enough.

"there doesn't seem to be anything here"
Yes, yes I know, Reddit :( 
@_date: 2013-06-21 04:05:10
What I would do is buy from Coinjar, transfer your bitcoins to WeExchange.co and cash out when needed.
They undervalue the price but it's your best option, so far.

Yeah Mt Gox gave me a giropost barcode $2 (Technocash) at the post office and then 2.95% taken by Mt Gox or since I'm verified 3.95% taken by Mt Gox when it comes straight from my bank account to the exchange.

Yes, but this is a screenshot of what I'm asking. Is the current data correct? :)

Coinjar.io accepts USD I believe. Could try. Worth a try.
@_date: 2013-06-08 10:50:24
How about you link it? The onus is on you to prove such an allegation :)
I've got 17,140 FTC so there's my interests there. Ok, as I said, say it is, my argument is that it was needed to establish exchanges, trade etc.
Was it such a bad thing? It's now rising from .00068 to .00093. It's weathered the storm of the first few months.

@_date: 2013-06-09 23:07:37
In Australia it is as worse.
Mt Gox is severing connections with Technocash, the only way (for under $10) that we Australians can deposit money via Technocash to Mt Gox from a post office or bank.
And now since that is gone, we have rip-off merchants here charging 10% commissions! Absurd. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 03:25:14
Ok. Go to WeExchange.co, sign up, add your bank account. You'll have to provide ID and proof of address etc. 
What that does is allow you to buy &amp; sell bitcoins, deposit and withdrawal AUD to your bank account. (Usually within 1 business day).
I would buy from Coinjar, sell from WeExchange. 
So far that's the easiest workaround I've found for Australians :P

No problems. It's been a long search for the right combination and fortunately or unfortunately it isn't from the same provider.

This is excellent. Came just in time when Mt Gox was severing their AUD deposit / withdrawal partners with Technocash.

It's quite simple actually. 
10% per BTC is charged at some exchanges, they do no charge whatever amount of BTCs you get as a whole. Mt Gox charges 0.6% per TRADE (which could contain many BTCs). 
@_date: 2013-08-18 14:34:20
I'm so glad that Coinjar.io came along for Australians at exactly the right time.

Have you seen the ridiculous price difference of WeExchange? Mt Gox: $138AUD - WeEx - $145 (And that's when the price fluctuation moves faster than WeEx). 
Selling there is $126. 
You're right about the volume which is something Aust exchanges needed to get right before even opening.

The Australian Taxation Office has said that a 'sales tax' needs to be factored into purchases where bitcoin is used - 10%
Their currency legislation basically covers any currency but they have admitted that they have been watching Bitcoin from the start. Which to me means that they are still learning the ins and outs.

It's difficult to implement an instant exchange method; retail, hospitality etc.
QR codes etc take longer and most people could care less about whipping out their phone, finding the QR / bitcoin app, entering in the amount, transferring etc.
I may be missing a development in how this exchange has evolved? A bitcoin debit card that's instantaneous?  
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:00:03
Bite the bullet and spend the remainder USD and never buy there again.
You Americans have it good (many choices) when it comes to depositing / withdrawing money into BTC exchanges ya'know :)
(I felt like one of those European pricks in movies who starts off by saying "You Americans..." *blah, blah, imperialism, fat etc* Sorry :P 
Australians are pretty lucky that **[Coinjar]( came along for us. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 00:25:16
Sorry I should clarify. 
At the unnamed BTC exchanges in Australia you are charged that percentage per BTC. 
Whereas at Mt Gox (until June 15th) you are charged 2.95-3.95% of the $AUD you deposit. 
$100 Deposit = $96.55 you get.
You are then charged 0.6% for your BTC purchase(s). 
Mt Gox charges 0.6% for each trade. Australian exchanges charge 5.9-10% per BTC, not per trade (Unless you buy one BTC :P). A trade meaning 2 or more...
@_date: 2013-10-20 11:37:04
I just want to make a living out of it, though. I missed that opportunity years ago and it's pretty hard to think of ways to do that now. Well, unless I wait 5-15+ years of course.
