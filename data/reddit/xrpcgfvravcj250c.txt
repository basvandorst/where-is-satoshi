it is more complicated - that guys name probably is English/American spelling of:
Schiller Name Meaning. German and Jewish (southern Ashkenazic): dialect variant of Schuler. German: nickname for someone with a squint, from an agent derivative of Middle High German schilhen, schiln 'to squint'. (modern German word: schielen ~= looking sideways or cross eyed)
Then there is also: 
"A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. ..."
"The origin of the term "shill" is uncertain; it may be an abbreviation of "shillaber." The word originally denoted a carnival worker who pretended to be a member of the audience in an attempt to elicit interest in an attraction."
Funny coincidence is the German verb schillern means  to twinkle or sparkle in the context of minerals such as moonstones ( Bitcoin to the moon!!!).

So more likely an internal software problem? It changed into different weirdness now. These up to 15 minute price freezes bouncing around a 1 cent spread don't look like normal exchange operation, e.g. $6559.00 &lt;-&gt; $6559.01 bouncing.

It seems like high frequency trading found its way to crypto exchanges.
