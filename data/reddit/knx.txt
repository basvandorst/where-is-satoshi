many exchanges allow you to withdraw it to fiat.
otherwise use localbitcoins.com

@_date: 2017-12-24 11:40:23
localbitcoins.com but be safe.

Don't send directly from coinbase, go to GDAX and withdraw through there. It's cheaper.
Get your money away from that exchange into a segwit wallet, set your fees as low as you can...

Cloud mining is not worth it for big coins like Bitcoin.
Nothing about being scammy, it's just paying 10 dollars to get 5 at the end.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:24:05
Yes, coinbase does this if you wish you can forward it to your grandma.
You can send btc even to an email address there.

Yes, this wallet is one of simplest ones to setup.

No experience, but if you research the founder of that coin,  I do not think you will want to get involved.

Can you also create a guide the other way around?
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:49:14
Yeah, 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:37:24
Yes, you can import your private keys into any other wallet client.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:39:48
Any client is fine, electrum included.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:13:34
You were probably mining with slush pool, try seeing if you have an account with them: 
Use those 12 words here to see if it matches a private key or import the 12 words into electrum.

There is only one way of doing it... you withdraw from kraken wallet into gdax wallet. You could try to exchange whatever you have into litecoin, making the transaction a bit cheaper.

Hardware wallets essentially help you with keeping private keys of internet, thats the main benefit.
You could also replicate this with client-only paper wallets though
