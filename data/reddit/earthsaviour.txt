Yeah. Sites like satoshitango or ripio used to have between 18 and 25. Haven’t checked those in a while though.

The problem in Argentina is that you never paid nearly as close the value of BTC. LB sellers do not have a good rate and local sites just overcharge a lot, something 10% or so. Also, not many cash trades in LB.

It is not as you can hop on a bus and pay with btc. Actually, a local crypto company (Bitex) allows people to top-up the SUBE card 
That is exactly what the article says.

Epic meme. The best one I ever seen related to Bitcoin.

Ok! So I will double check the address and give it to people. When I turn on the device the coins should be associated to the key and ready to be spend/sent.
Is it a good idea to keep my blockchain.info wallet and only use the ledger to send/receive my own transactions? It may be easy to give someone my address and keep tracking on my phone.
I do not use bitcoin on daily basis, just two shops in my city accept them.

It was more like for convenient, to actually "see" the transaction completed. But I can do the same by looking the transaction in the blockchain as an user say before. I will keep the blockchain.info with a few bucks just in case I have to send money to someone, 100 dollars tops.
If I receive a transaction to an address in Nano S, will that address keep working in the future? New address is great for privacy but an older address will do fine when I am out of home.

Really clear. Thanks!

Yeah, sure. I always push for better privacy. But sometimes I buy from friends so I feel comfortable with reutilizing the address only with them.
Thanks all for the answers, much appreciated.

Price. Then I come here for the memes.

Cool mate, great answer, thanks!
Yeah, I will keep those words safer than the marriage certificate.
