There wasn't another trade app or company that didn't feel the last two days.  I use coinbase but know that if my coins appreciate to a particular dollar figure,  ill go to a hardware wallet. 
It's hard to predict what this market will do and coinbase just didn't have the server power or people to keep up.

This guy doesn't understand HODL or the principals behind Bitcoin.

Just like in the stock market... it's going to go up and down daily. Some days.. up a lot.. some days.. down a lot. Over the next year, 5 years, 10 years.. the over all will be up.
Keep up with Bitcoin news (Currently Segwit, August 1st, Countries interested, Alt coins). If you feel something is going to be a massive blow, then you should decide what you want to do.
I would not seek monetary advice from Strangers. Educate yourself.. decide if you feel secure in losing what you invest.. and maybe.. just maybe.. you come out on top =D

A) You should reach out to Coinbase for explainations
B) I just tested 
$10 = $0.99 (9.9%)
$20 = $1.49 (7.45%)
$25 = $1.49 (5.96%)
$15 = $1.49 (9.93%)
$11 = $1.49 (13.54%)
$100 = $2.99 (2.99%)
Different investment = Different cut. The good thing is they don't subtract it from your over all.
Fees are going to be part of it. You want your account to be secure and servers to be up (Like you saw today when a mass of people tried to log on... can't do that without money). They have to pay people to supply you a service.
