not really. maybe you can do a cash advance at an ATM, then deposit it into your bank account for slightly less.

eh. ask someone else. don't mention bitcoin, just tell them the account numbers. probably just someone overthinking their job which is simply to type the numbers you give them into a form and press submit.

etoro doesn't sell bitcoins or any cryptocurrencies.. they just allow you to bet on the price.

*shrug* I don't really see the point of bitcoin visa cards.. you can withdraw to your bank account and use your normal visa card for lower fees.. maybe it's handy if it's anonymous'ish, but what are you gonna buy with a virtual visa? a netflix subscription in a fake name? you can actually just put any name on any order you make with any (ie, normal) visa card as it doesn't affect the validation anyway.. getting stuff delivered physically might be difficult with a fake billing address.

Maybe try these guys; 
Some other exchanges you could try;  (up to USD $500k/mo on the tier4 verification).. you're probably going to need some utility bills or bank statements showing your address.. maybe you could ask the guy selling the house if you can order a second phoneline to the house or switch some other utilities into your name temporarily.
also  allows unlimited EUR withdrawals on their top tier verification level.
you could also try bitstamp again and try to sort out what they don't like about your residence documentation.

Use revolut.com and/or possibly fire.com to send EUR to an EUR exchange like kraken.com or bitstamp.net - including all fx fees and exchange fees it can work out under 1%.

If they're still sitting on the btc they mined they might be able to give their investors a return without doing anything else.

right. you can withdraw gbp or whatever they allow you to withdraw at a rate their price feed dictates.

sure.. maybe.. since there's no way to withdraw you'll only be able to trade at whatever prices they have on etoro, which may not necessarily be the same as anywhere else.. you might miss price spikes on some particular venue or similar flash crashes.. also etoro might go bankrupt and you lose everything.. but it probably mostly works if that's all you care about I guess.

the exchanges will switch to a p2p model like localbitcoins.com or paxful.com etc.

The best way is to trade in EUR and get an EUR bank account.. then use other fx services to convert the EUR back to GBP. check out revolut.com and fire.com, and also bunq.com.
