There are so many scams out there that you cannot tell, I ay, hold them, hit faucets, and if you also do altcoins, trade them up into BTC.

I was not begging. I was just wondering exactly what to do shy of begging.

KUDOS for sending a link to where I can buy plane tickets for a trip to either TO, Canada or FL sometime when I do get enough bitcoins to at least get the plane. KUDOS.

I figured out that far, but I wondered what had to take place in a thread.

I didn't think hotels accepted much cash, if any for hotels and it is likely hard to do it that "old-school way" for car rentals and plane tickets. I know one of the travel sites now take Bitcoin. Another time when I collect several Bitcoin, I am going to book  me a flight to Toronto purely by Bitcoin at Orbitz or Expedia after I find out WHO accepts Bitcoin. I had foregone who it is. I have to look it up.
I can't wait to travel using Bitcoin. I think it is changing, slowly but surely.

I bought a couple domains with BTC at Namecheap. They now accept Bitcoin. I couldn't have been happier.

Good job I gave up on gambling. Only an ODD ODD scratchie a couple times a year at worst. Those 1-2 scratchies are IT for me. If I lose, I just say fuckit and forget it all.
