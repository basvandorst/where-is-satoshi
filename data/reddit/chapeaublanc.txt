Well, transaction cost is what miners get right? 
If everything is "lumped together" how it can be done on 1M blocks and will miners lose if LN is adopted?

What about miners, are they out of the picture completely?

If I'm buying coffee, do I have to wait for channel to close? What if bulk transaction never happen for some reason, does that mean that the merchant lose everything in that bulk transaction?

10% hashrate = 80 days to survive. It really is an eternity and I'm note sure most people will be patient and endure extreme fees and txs delays.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:06:00
Well I don't know what or how it will happen but in my opinion it is more probable the the B2X price increase will be driven by B1X price decrease (because of higher fees and much longer delays people can eventually start panicking and cause price to collapse). 
Maybe at first, Fiat will benefit from panic, then B2X progressively over few weeks if it is indeed more user friendly, on paper it definitely is more user friendly. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:51:28
If you read carefully, they basically said that Bitcoin should not scale and the number of transactions should remain as low as possible to allow diversity in miners. 
 
No one in their right mind would want a non scalable Bitcoin and/or not being able to use it as payment method for anything they want. The whole store of value without being able to buy everyday things with it is pile of crap IMHO. So what's next ? More and more people are flooding crypto world but BTC is already at maximum capacity thanks to brilliant engineers who designed the best non scalable system. The answer is obvious, they'll buy and use another coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:21:02
Quite the opposite in case the new one is for GPU mining. Lot of GPU hashrate out there, lot more then asicboost. 
I would also like to hear what they have to say but some amateurs already did it with BTC Gold, so it's definitely possible. I would just love to have core dev team implement it in BTC itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:58:45
My bad, I thought you were referring to less mining power outage. PoW change will not happen though, Bitcoin Gold was a great idea but very poor team and execution. We will be in difficult situation as long as current algorithm favors Asics. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:39:18
You really think the scaling problem was known one month ago or something?
Satoshi talked about it in 2010 and the solution is to increase block size, not in an aggressive way S2X attempted, but still, it should be increased.
 
So now we are in a situation where BTC is rendered unusable, and BCH is sitting there smiling and fully scalable and usable.
 
Easy to understand what majority will do, it is already happening...
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:44:34
I'm just saying that the current issue BTC have is that the Chinese hardware is more efficient. And the reason is asicboost. 
Not lot of options out there, either create an equally efficient alternative in the west or change the algorithm. 
B2X is not the problem per se IMHO. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:26:55
I talk about current state of affairs and so should everyone. What will happen in the future remain unknown. Today Bitcoin is not scalable and clogged. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:30:04
Reducing transaction fees is an upgrade, I don't understand your logic.

@_date: 2017-11-07 08:50:25
I fully understand your point of view and respect it. I just think that in digital.world, both chains are to be considered 2018 Camry as the apparence is same to the end customer. The difference exists but is hidden in internals, so the only visible difference is the speed, cost and gaz consumption. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:00:57
You'll be maybe even more hit in the ass if everyone sells in following hours and go back to alts.
A huge chunk of Bitcoin money came from alts, let's not forget.

The topic is not "mining" but manufacturing the hardware for efficient mining.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:25:25
Exactly, GPU algorithms are best for decentralization. The real question is why the Core team don't want to implement it? I see no reason not to, and multiple advantages.
 
True decentralization as literally anyone could mine it.
 
Now, who's gonna investigate and potentially find that core team is in fact linked to the whole miners gang?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:16:18
So you are not engineer, nor technically savvy person, but you are able to understand that "andreas and nick szabo have much better arguments"?
 
It seems that you are just stating your preference and hoping for the best. It would be better if you actually could listen to both sides, and then make an educated statement.
Roger Ver is being portrayed on this forum as some kind of villain, because this forum is applying censorship in a sense that you cannot say anything against BTC or core team without being downvoted or even banned. It doesn't mean he is objectively a bad person, quite the contrary in fact. 
 
At the beginning, it was kind of funny, now I think it's similar to a sect.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:10:57
The fees are high because the network is clogged. BTC is unable to scale and receive hundreds of new users willing to transact. It's just not happening, and people are looking for a scalable alternative. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:56:03
Andreas in your video is talking about IPv4 allocation without even mentioning IPv6 which solved the issue completely since 1998. Let's forget that, he is maybe just unaware or wanting to make an argument in front of non tech-savvy audience.
 
On the block increase issue, he is of course right. The off-chain solution has to be implemented, eventually. No one in their right mind is against this, event the S2X guys.
But right now, we don't have the off-chain solution, and it will probably not be ready before several years because Bitcoin core devs either didn't give a fuck or they lack competence to put it in place.
So we should increase the block size by one order of magnitude because we have no choice, Bitcoin is suffocating under pressure. Not 5, not 10, not 100 orders of magnitude. Just fucking one. And guess what, Bitcoin Cash is just that, this is the reason it is successful and eating away clogged BTC as we speak. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:28:32
Let me guess, you would like to ban anyone who dare disagree with you, right?
You should talk to a professional :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:17:54
Exactly, also I would like to propose to think out of the box : if we are unable to manufacture hardware as efficient as the one manufactured by Bitmain, we are still able to switch to another algorithm which doesn't favor asicboost. And voilà, centralization issue solved. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:46:19
I don't, why would I? This is unrelated to the scaling issue. Look at the competition, scaling problem doesn't exist with far more transactions. 
 
The core team is bunch of stubborn kids unable to understand the market requirements even though I'm sure they capable technically to find a solution.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:03:48
I would not be that optimistic. 
If after 10 days the B2X price goes up, it will be more and more profitable to mine it and maybe even render the B1X fork unattractive. Let's not forget that it will contain more txs per block at much lower fees. We must admit that it is more technologically advanced and wanted from end customer POV. 
40 days is very very long period, the B1X price will probably go down a lot because of transaction delays and higher fees. 
The time will tell us, but from miners perspective it makes sense to take an initial hit and accumulate B2X coins if they think their value will surpass the B1X one in few weeks/months. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:01:49
I'll buy more also, but  when all alt money goes back to alts.

@_date: 2017-11-08 17:52:07
Let's see if recent price increase was because increasing demand or just wanting free coins.
We shell know in few hours if alts are being pumped or not.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:46:49
I'm just using the term used by the author of the article for clarity. I agree that the Bitcoin as we know it will die with the original chain if the B2X fork is successful. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:40:26
From the end customer perspective it is an upgrade as the fees are lower due to the block increase. It all depends what is more important in your opinion. 
 
To me it's like telling a customer that a given car A is better even though it has same apparence as the car B except it is slower, use more gaz and have less autonomy. Maybe it has better internals, but does it really matter if the end product is inferior overall?
I expect this to be downvoted as people tend to get angry here when someone has different opinion. So please, suit yourself, don't be frustrated and punish me, I fully deserve it :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:13:30
"Pretty much..." wrong :)
Anyone with 2 neurons in their brain can stop and ask himself what kind of hardware is mining the BTC with Segwit right now.
But as expected, people in love this kind of propaganda articles. Hidden agendas everywhere, right.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:43:14
It's based on more then 1000 blocks before difficulty adjustment with only 20% mining power. This is what will happen, it's not sci-fi. 40 days of nightmare for the original chain. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:54:38
That, or the price will be back sub 5000 very very quickly, if in fact people just wanted free coins and are getting back to alts now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:21:08
It is because of censorship on this forum that people here think that others are bad people with bad intentions.

I'm here to discuss and share my opinion. Does that bother you?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:08:48
At least 40 days outage, this is almost eternity for BTC to survive. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:14:01
Well, B2X is an upgrade over the original, from the technical perspective as it allows blocks with increased size. 
 
The centralization is caused by ASIC friendly algorithm, the elephant in the room if you prefer. Everyone seems focused on the block size when a simple change in algorithm can quickly and permanently remove centralization. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:12:32
I don't want to capitulate to anyone, but the reason the miners are perceived as great danger is because of the current algorithm in favor of asicboost. I'm regularly downvoted for saying this, but what can I do, I'm stubborn :)
 
The only way to truly decentralize Bitcoin right now is to implement a different algorithm, maybe GPU one I don't know. PoS is currently not a viable option, but could also work in the future. 
For me, and I may be wrong, the whole movement against block increase is in fact a movement against centralization at miners level. So why not attack the problem at its roots and get rid of the current algorithm? The only answer to this is that maybe, just maybe, the core dev team are not telling us the whole story. Maybe there are hidden links between them and asicboost miners.

When you sell, someone else buys. This is the nature of the block-chain. If you want to help Bitcoin, you shouldn't initiate any transaction on S2X at all.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:33:19
I don't know if you are aware, but if you sell it means that someone is buying, thus there are transactions to mine for ASICBoosters.
By selling, you are helping S2X

Well, not surprising. The algorithm changed completely, and this is actually a good thing for Bitcoin. 
I would prefer this version over the existing one where only ASIC miners can mine efficiently.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:08:09
This is because of the algorithm we are on, not because of block size.
 Current algorithm favors ASICS boost.
"greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist" : 
 
ASICS boost = Devil
 
GPU algorithm = SSD (not BTG of course :o )
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:55:41
You should stop spreading lies. Satoshi wanted to implement block size increase, just not immediately at that time in 2010.
They discussed it openly, that's it.

You right, apologies
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:03:02
Exactly, and people tend to forget that Satoshi himself wanted the block increase.
This community is slowly becoming toxic and will eventually fade out. Everyone is talking about how big blocs = centralization, but no one is mentioning ASICS as main reason for this, disgusting.
I expect a huge surprise when S2X hit hard with their ASICS pools (not much to do with 2MB blocks and everything to do with shitty algorithm we are on).

@_date: 2017-10-26 14:58:11
I'm not talking about demand/supply, you are obviously right.  But the more important thing right now is the mining of the chain. We should not give anything to mine on S2X chain for few weeks, this is the only way to force miners back to original chain. 
The problem is people are greedy and will dump their S2X quickly. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:30:52
By learning that the real enemy of centralization is ASICBoost, not S2X per se which is just a byproduct of the aforementioned, preexisting centralization.
Bitcoin will be vulnerable, and maybe even disappear under ASICBoost friendly algorithm pressure.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:49:41
All miners take action now please :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:12:56
OK, so if you buy Bitcoin, it means you are empowering Bitcoin? Well this is fallacious because in order for you to buy it, someone has to sell it at same price.
 
The only way to help one coin is to make transactions on the related chain, don't ovethink this too much. By selling you are helping yourself, not Bitcoin, especially at the beginning where it's important not to participate in any transaction on S2X chain. Transactions = mining = fees for miners = happy chain
 
Guess what, that's exactly what will happen, resulting in S2X being mined and the BTC chain being clogged when lot of people try to buy BTC while not enough miners are present. Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:13:42

Not if you can buy more BTC with dollars instead of going through BCC selling. Most will lose money for sure. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:33:29
Well, the value of BCC is not created out of thin air, it is taken from BTC. Let say btc is 3000 at the time of fork. Once forked, BTC will keep 2500 and BCC will get 500. 
People think that the value of BCC is some kind of present but in reality they will have to sell it really quickly just to recover initial BTC value. 
Now picture all whales waiting for BCC and you can imagine the outcome: BCC will instantly drop to sub 100 while BTC will take some time to recover. People will lose money, a lot. 
Sure you will increase a little bit your btc stack but overall you'll lose money because you'll be able to buy more BTC if you keep your 3000. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:41:08
Yes but what they are not telling anyone is that future value of BCC + BTC is equal to current value of BTC alone. Lot of people think that this is some kind of present, in fact it is the opposite and lot of users will actually lose money. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:17:19
The value will be split between two coins, so no it is not a giveaway.
You risk losing a portion of the value in the process if you don't act very quickly, which most of us will not be able to.
