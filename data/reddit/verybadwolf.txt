What are the rules and regulations for selling canned preserves? I make and preserve my own sauces,salsas,peanut butters,jams,soups etc. Would I need some sort of license to sell these items? I  use all organic ingredients and many of them come from my own garden. I follow all proper sanitary measures. I have never sold my products at a market though because it requires expensive certifications, especially if you want to label anything "organic”.

I looked over the site and saw a small bit about licensing. I assume that if I wanted to sell 'certified organic' it would require a USDA label. I really do not want to support the food industry in any way, so I will not apply for certain licensing. 
I do know that if you label your product as  “Ital" (which is a Rastafarian religious code) you do not need to apply for the same regulations and are held to a different standard.
I really want to support bitcoin and I'd love to put my stuff on the market. I'd love to know more bout the requirements needed to sell food.

I have used my CC very responsibly to buy BTC and have done very well!

Is the argument that creating bitcoins is an act of fraud because its a currency that isn't being regulated and taxed? Truly curious.

How do you afford free shipping? I'm just starting out on my own business and shipping prices are outrageous &gt;_&lt;
