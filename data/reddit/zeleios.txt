How do you USAers trust an app that uses green neon for charts??
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:52:31
Coinbase card, you can withdraw fiat from banks paying with it

Got 1.5k$ stuck in "pending transfer" since yesterday...not really calling that a good job
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:06:16
They're taking ages for internal transfers too (coinbase-&gt;gdax). There's no excuse making anche unreliable service active for then not responding to support tickets. This behaviour just get them becoming more and more Shady to the public in direct connection with cryptocurrencies

You're Just getting full of the laziest italians (= cheap retired and Erasmus studente) so i don't actually now if that's considerable wealthy citizens. Still love ur country, especially Porto..not aveiro, though ^^

I think you're correct, they are full of nonsense on taxes. If you are italian and go live in Portugal your retirement money Is tax free: a lot of italian people get more retirement while living in Portugal then living in Italy

Me! Just 11k/Btc, only for you my friend
@_date: 2019-11-07 08:36:08
Because...why the hell should anyone get more retirement money getting It out of their country? �� Italy signed that and i don't understand why

This is a simple painting, not anything spectacular but it's nice. Just enjoy the b00bs...not everything has to elevate human existence to ideal nirvanic truths. B00bs are great, why not paint them? Greeks didn't ObJeCtIfY male athletic bodies

Because he's not stupid...dont act as one yourself too asking retorical questions
@_date: 2019-10-22 10:35:10
"it's not like crypto users dont want regulators, they Just want clarity" straight up naive, or stupid

Could not bear more then one "0.0029 OF Bitcoin" as a European this lack of familiarity with measure units is too painful to watch

We really should stop this "listen to this child" thing

Bitcoin hits ATH --- Bitcoin hits ATL
Pretty accurate

Coinbase is trustworthy imho...said that if u wanna use credit/debit Just instabuy in coinbase (3/4% of interests +7/8$ of commissions for those amounts), if u want to avoid fees and squeeze  a little more out of your cash go in gdax (trade platform owned by coinbase so same account) and pay in with SEPA (buy @ actual price without commission fee), buy from there and then u can get ur btc on your coinbase for free. Keep in mind that SEPA deposits on gdax could take a couple of days so be aware of price fluctuations
