I sometimes do that but am trying to diversify my investments within the top 20 cryptos because ultimately btc will not be the dominant currency in the future sadly :(. Myspace is to Facebook as Bitcoin is to... (insert altcoin here).

It took me 4 weeks to get approved over this past summer. They will get to you eventually!

Use Binance, but you have to exchange your btc or ether for xrp.

I'm into Iota, Stellar, Ripple, and Ether.

I sold 1.3 btc at $1279. Im waiting on a correction to buy back in.
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:32:45
Hmmm... interesting well Ive already sold and I will wait until March 11th to see what happens. Even if there isn't too much of a dip I will still buy back in. 
I think that the stock market is overvalued, and that when the market does go into a recession bitcoin will be a great asset to own.

Thats how the government works. They keep you waiting and know that they will deny you anyways but drag it out so you cant come back and try again.

How likely will the ETF go through? And if not would there be a price plunge not an increase?

There's plenty of resources at the bottom of the ocean that haven't been found. No one knows how much gold is out there.

I sold about a week ago. I want to buy back in but cant!
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:01:17
How much of a dip are we talking? 
That would be awesome if bitcoin got to that point! I am definitely optimistic about bitcoin in the future, but as for someone like me would it be smart to sell before and then buy back after a dip. I am really not confident that there will be an etf for bitcoin yet.

bovada.iv I've used them in the past without and issue! I bet on the election, and nfl football. Be aware to not sign up for the promotions otherwise you will have to win at least 1500 to cash out unless you are already risking &gt; that amount.

Same, I just moved everything off of coinbase for that reason. They now want my ssn and more personal information than what I gave them from before.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:45:11
Ill check it out. thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:29:46
Oh, well I moved my bitcoin off of coinbase to a private wallet for $1.12 in fees. As for buying bitcoin you either have to use coinbase, gemini or local bitcoins to buy more.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:50:38
I moved mine out today! I am so glad to be done with them. After they started asking for my ssn I really got annoyed by their policies and decided to leave.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:50:44
I ditched coinbase!
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:32:39
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:55:13

@_date: 2017-07-15 13:41:42
Okay thanks!
