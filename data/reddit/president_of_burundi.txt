I am a girl, you man-sized child. My only problem is with sad fucks like you who blame all your problems on other people instead of seeing that you are *personally* undesirable because you have vile views and most women think you're garbage because of them.
Except your girlfriend (*Hi, most-likely-imaginary girlfriend who is totally reading this, you can do way better even if you're imaginary*)  who I'm sure loves when you tell her about all the men broken by bitches and your ex-bitch and whatever else stupid fucking garbage you spew daily trying to make yourself feel better about what a waste you are.

The actual meaning of 'being able to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps'  is that someone is attempting a ludicrously far-fetched or impossible task since you actually *can't ever* pull yourself off the ground by your own boots.
I mean, it still applies to wealth distribution in the US, just not in the way you think it does.

Fair enough! I still would cite original meaning as actual meaning vs. attributed meaning, but we can agree to disagree.

Yeah. I didn't think that either/the one of you were English speakers because- *Jesus* reading this was painful. The way you two/one (jacking it furiously?) contract words and form sentences was very obviously non-English- which is fine, unless you're a sad piece of shit trying to push a stupid, pathetic agenda. Honestly, I was just hoping that no two people in a non-incel sub were this fucking awful. 
But apparently you are, though, SO congrats you're both fucking losers. Women don't like you because you are *terrible*. Maybe you can make enough money with crypto that you can just buy a person that will ignore how fucking sad you are.
PS: They'll still think about it though.

Does anyone else think this sounds like this guy is having an in depth discussion with his own alt? Maybe these pathetic fucking woe-is-me incel muppets all have exactly the same weirdly halting idiosyncratic writing style but this sounds like both of them are the same user jacking themselves off to fantasies about how devil women did them dirty.

People started misusing it during times of economic distress and the misuse stuck. You can claim that idiom is idiom and the original meaning as it was understood for a hundred years doesn't matter to you but saying it was never used that way is wrong- that is the original intended use and given the problems with the idea of simply pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps as the solution to economic hardship it's interesting to consider that people using it are citing a literal impossibility as a goal.
