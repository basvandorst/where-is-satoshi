Yes. It does. I'm actually in the UK right now. I have both a CC from Sweden and one from Barclays, they both work.
The only thing that is not working is linking the bank account, since they want a routing number (not a sort code) so I guess that's for the US only for the time being.

It hasn't come into effect yet. It will at 1st of September this year. Here: 
Based on that new fee schedule, to get to 0.19% you need to trade 350,000$
Not only that, but they are introducing a shitty concept called "credits" or "fee credits" instead of actual clean amounts.
It's explained in their email to me today:
Take a look at the new Kraken. It's as shitty as it can be, complicated without the need just because some dumbass marketing  manager figured it's something new and "smart".
FEE credits? Promotions? Redeemable codes and shit? Fuck that. I've already had it up to my ears with all the shitty club cards and store cards and point collecting from every single business out there.
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:00:25
You can. Try it. I guarantee 100% if will work with a CC from the UK. Mine does.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:55:36
I'm doing the same when I get home later tonight. I'd rather take everything out now than wait for 1st of September.

Send from your Italian bank account, via SEPA, through  into your UK bank.
I was reluctant until I tried it the 1st time. 1£ fee (no currency exchange fees and the exchange rate is insanely good).
I wanted to send someone some EUR (from the UK) so I did the math:
A UK high street bank (Halifax) would have charged me 9£ for the transfer, plus a currency exchange fee, plus an international transfer fee, although the currency exchange fee is not stated, they use their own exchange rate which is 2-3% inflated.
The whole thing would have cost me about 20£ just to send around 250£ to someone in Sweden.
I did it via TransferWise and the only loss was a 1£ fee.
The end-user received 44 more EUR compared to how much he would have received if I would have done it directly through the bank.
What TransferWise does is match you with other people, match a good exchange rate, and they don't take a high commission (their commission was 1£ so that's really low, but it's a bit more if you want to send bigger sums).
I think you should keep this in mind, whatever you do with Bitcoin, just in case you need it.
It was also fast. Took less than 24 hours.
@_date: 2014-09-04 14:08:26
That's odd. I now have linked debit and credit cards from Sweden, UK and Romania. None required any verification.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:49:26
they are burner if you make them as burner. Meaning: You have a main bank, and if you want to buy bitcoin, you "pass" the money through either one of these and then send them to the exchange.
This is intended so that your main account doesn't get closed, but instead smile or the other one does.
It's only a burner if you make it a burner.
How's smile?
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:02:50
Sure - don't use Kraken!
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:10:13
Like I said in my other thread [Kraken doubled the fees. Bad move. Very bad move.]( Kraken is turning to shit.
When I registered with them I could trade for 10,000$ per month without any sort of verification, without sending any document. It was only after 10,000$ per month that you needed to upload a scan of an ID.
Then I find out they removed that. Because apparently "law" but that's false. Most countries allow up to a certain limit without a KYC scheme, Kraken et al just do it anyway so they appease the banks, but they aren't required to.
In any case, I thought that was bad, but now I find out they want ID SELFIES?!
That's rich. I have never, ever in my entire life heard of any financial institution or government requiring a business a ridiculous thing such as: "Hei, you got to ask your customers for selfies otherwise you are illegal."
PayPal for example doesn't want selfies. It's bad enough they want a scanned ID, it's even worse they want it before breaching that limit under which you are allowed to trade, it's the worst that we now see selfies as a KYC.
Fuck that. Off I go to the ATM in Old Street Tube station. Yeah, it has a mark-up, but at least the darned thing won't ask for an autograph and a selfie.

What's that expression in English that expresses the fact that you are stating a fact to someone that already completely agrees with you?
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:08:37
You're lucky with the bank you have then. Halifax (as per my screenshot) charged me a 2.70% of the amount + another flat £1.5.
Will definitely use Circle again if they open up a GBP and/or EUR account.
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:25:36
And here is how Bitcoin will be just another instrument of the very thing it's trying to tear down: The financial establishment.
In the end, everything we fought for and dreamed of will be nothing. Our overlords know how to manipulate the shit out of everything and Bitcoin won't be that decentralised, free, awesome currency that allows people to exchange money freely without any outside intervention.
Just a couple of months ago someone was touting how Bitcoin is awesome for oh so many people that don't even have an address, etc.
And now you'll need a photo ID to use it, just like banks.
Fuck everything about this.

I don't trade alt. I'm in it for Bitcoin, this is the Bitcoin subreddit.
As for the fees, as I said, it's not only the fees that increased considerably, but also the LIMITS WHICH LOWER THOSE FEES. That's pretty important since you'll not only be trading at a much higher fee, but you'll also be trading for much longer since the limit is harder to reach in order to lower the fee.
Aaaand since there's a 30 day reset period on the fees... Well, it basically means that unless you're a millionaire turning around 100K every 10 days, you'll pretty much be trading close to the highest limit they have.
It's a double-fuckery and it's unethical. You want to raise the fees? Fine. At least leave the limits there, but no, they couldn't get enough of it, so they put their hands in both honey jars.
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:12:01
I think you can transfer it out if you first make a purchase (with a CC). It's true I didn't take ONLY the 10$ and ran. I bought 50$ extra, then took the whole 60$. Maybe that's the issue you are facing?
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:54:49
I don't think it's a first come first served kind of thing.

1) I don't really tend to believe anything I read on the Internet. That being said, do you have any proof of anything?
2) Where's your blog post that got you banned?

Cancel it. Cancel it now. Go back to dell.com and buy with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:58:34
I agree. I just deposited to Kraken TODAY and there was no such non-sense requirement. I can prove it too.

Not to sound mean but seriously, it's your fault for fucking up so badly:  
1) You don't send checks for someone's birthday, especially not your mom.  
2) You don't send checks.  
@_date: 2014-09-04 00:57:35
WHAT?! FUCK!
So wait... wait wait hold up.
If linking bank account only works from the US.  
If using a CC has a cash advance fee.  
Then the best solution is my debit card.  Right? I'm going to try that now.  
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:14:25
Look at my screenshot. Everything was done in the same day, buying, transferring, account creation too. As I mentioned above, if it would show time, you could see it actually all happened inside a 2 minute window. The BTC is in my wallet now. There was no verification, no waiting time, nothing.
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:10:43
I'm going to try that.
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:58:00
Exactly. 100% spot on about my reaction too. I actually followed through and I can't stop buying. I'm almost, almost on the verge of going into fucking debt to buy Bitcoin.
That's not good. I need to stop.
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:54:32
That's the one. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:24:54
Buuuhhh I never used Coinbase I'm from Europe and from my PoV  is much older than kraken.com - I don't see why we call it shady, because it doesn't have a sleek interface or that the people behind it don't want to be publicly known?
It's older and has done nothing wrong so far. In any case, buuhhuu I'm not going there either.
There are plenty of other ways.
Also, it's not about finding a better deal, it's about sending a message. Kraken used to be la creme in terms of exchange. Fast, sleek, prompt, low fees, easy verification process.
The last six months though... deposit problems, no customer service, increased fees, increased limits for lowering fees, selfies for KYC? Yeah.... no.
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:27:05
I hope they make it. I don't like Coinbase. Why? It's getting too much of a hold over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:48:54
What bank are you with? Did you incur a foreign purchase fee? I'm still waiting to see if Halifax charges me that darned fee.
If it doesn't, then it's safe to say I can also withdraw to that debit card, without any 9 pound fee for receiving money in another currency.
But if it does... damn.
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:11:05
I transferred it out immediately after buying. Look at my screenshot. The account creation, linking of CC, buying BTC and transferring out all went through in the same day. If it would show the time too, you could see it actually all happened within the span of 2 minutes, tops.
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:09:43
I didn't get that message at all. My CC just went straight through and the purchase was completed.
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:53:55
The problem with bitcoin debit cards that work like this is the fact that for all the hype and hopes that we had for Bitcoin, we are now ourselves fucking it up and instead of using Bitcoin, we just fuck around and integrate it into the very system we are trying to reform.
I mean, this way, you're still at the mercy of banks and processing companies and VISA itself.
You just bought a prepaid Visa card with Bitcoin. There's nothing historic or revolutionary in this. It happens every single across the world, people buy prepaid debit cards in all sorts of manners and currencies.
I think Xapo and debit cards for Bitcoin are pretty much the worst thing we could have come up with. Not only we fuck ourselves, continuing to be part of the same old same old that we were so desperately trying to change, but it also hinders direct bitcoin adoption by merchants, because now they can put the burned on the consumer, instead of them just starting to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-05 15:30:02
It's not instant. It can take up to 2 hours, sometimes more. Most of the times it is close to instant, yes - but not always. Bitcoin transactions are instant - always.
However, there's that "confirmation" thingy, so.. yeah.
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:05:13
Forget the dude that responded. He's wrong.
I received my invite on a bogus email address. I made the account with that, I also provided a bogus name for the account.
There is absolutely no verification. The only thing that needs to match is the billing address of your credit card with... well, the actual real billing address of that card, but that's out of their hands (the bank checks that).
You can also change your email later on to anything you wish, AND YOUR NAME TOO.
I did it two times (first from bogus to my real name, then as mentioned in my original post, to my fathers name). It doesn't demand any social number and you can put whatever address you want. When you add an account (or a cc) that's when you input THAT card's address, but the address in your account can be whatever.
It literally has no verification at all. I went through buying in less than 2 mins. I didn't both putting any real info the first time around specifically to check if it works.
As it stands right now: This website is a carder's wet dream - with a 500$ weekly limit though (but it increases if the card is not stolen, the transaction goes through and there's no chargeback).

@_date: 2014-09-04 01:03:17
OK so the dude from the first comment says it takes a cash advance fee for using a credit card.
I have deduced that:
If using a credit card has a cash advance fee (regardless of country) then the best way is to go with your debit card. If you have a bank account, you most certainly have a debit card too.
I have just tested this with both a debit card from Sweden and one from the UK. No fees, and transfers both ways work (as in: you actually receive money on your debit card if you withdraw. Like, really fast).
@_date: 2014-08-15 10:41:53
Well, it won't be a success unless you offer the whole thing. I mean what's the reasoning behind something like this?
"Hei let's give people only half of the product. If they like it, we'll give all of it".
It's like buying an ice-cream without the cone.
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:12:45
I think that's what happened. Because that's what I did. 10$ plus a 50$ purchase, transfered it out in the same 2 minute period. No questions asked.
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:21:52
I think you might have rushed through it:
Towards the bottom you write "the fasted" wallet. You meant "the fastest".
You also write "ain't no body..." and I believe it is "ain't nobody..." - I think.

What do you mean a felony? Why? I changed the name and everything with his information. The account is completely legit.
Yes, it was me that got the invitation, and I decided to give it to my father who could use it more than me.
