how can he be saying that for months.....if we haven't formed a triple bottom until this week? literally makes no sense. 6 months ago we were ATH?

I'm still waiting for the high

Mt.Gox isnt selling any more BTC until at least September....so yeah, that point isnt valid

Didn't really buy the high... I'm 10% down on my investment. So nothing too bad. I believe in it long term so I'm not worried.

Why not sell at 7500, and buy back in at 7000....more BTC...thats the goal?

Today in 1969, the 363-feet tall Saturn V rocket launched for Apollo 11 - our first mission to land NASA Astronauts on the Moon. That is all.

LOL, I know what shorting a stock is. The original post said it would first be in their interest to "drive stock price down"....opening a short doesn't drive the price down.... opening a short is betting the price WILL go down. In order to drive the price down, you need to own the BTC to sell off, to drive the price down. Thats exactly what happened with this bubble. Investors stocked up on bitcoin before the futures, then sold off everything to profit once they were released. This is Investing 101 stuff, golly.

 No I think 4 hour RSI needs to cool off before we test 8k. Bulls need a breather

How can you drive down the price of bitcoin when you have no BTC to sell off to drive the price down in the first place? Logic.
