I signed up quite some time ago for the beta, glad to see it's making it out there now.

FYI:: Everyone who has contacted me about miners, you will get one, I did not run out and infact you might get more than one. Sending out the first batch today to those who have provided me addresses. I will try to ensure i follow up to the rest of the pm's today to get your info so i can spread the usb asic love as much as possible.

welp, looks like im writing a script to parse the page every 30 minutes in case they try to get rid of the entry. Not a fan of Wiki watching but I am sick of letting Gox run this monopoly and continue to rip people off. If they deny edits to the page or anything shady i'll let you all know ;)

wsj can eat my dirty ass if they think im gonna pay for their half ass articles just to maintain their new york oh look at me imz a writur salaries. As for Kapeles, thankfully I didn't lose a cent like much of the community and bailed out weeks prior but I still vow to smash this lumpy looking fucktwat in the face if ever seen at a "Bitcoin Meetup". After all he can certainly afford the plastic surgery.

*TO ALL THE AWESOME NEWBIES COMMENTING ABOUT WANTING A USB MINER SENT TO THEM*As I said to to a few of the folks who have PM'd me about them, just toss me the address via pm and i'll have the wife print out a shipping label and figure out the cost while she is at work. We are NC based. It shouldn't even come close to or be over the price of priority shipping which is 5$ flat. I'm still going through responses and will be determining how many I'm sending each person, based on who responded first and how many I have left in total etc. Hope to hear from you all soon ;) TO THE MOON!

Apologies for the multi-posts. But if any newbs out there simply want to mine for fun and to learn more about Bitcoins and the process. Send me a PM, I've got more than a handful of 1.5-2.0Ghs Bitmain USB ASIC Miners and ALOT of of the original USB Block Erupter miners which I'd be happy to send out to the first newbs who contact me for free.
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:26:46
Thank god they are all mostly senile now and easy to scam.
@_date: 2014-12-02 13:08:43
lol no worries, they went out to everyone who provided or helped me  with shipping costs initially, don't really feel like sending the rest out in plain envelopes. Hoping i have enough money this weekend to cover postage for a few folks to get the rest of the requested miners out the door.

I've been mining for 3 years now, first on GPU's and Now with this lame 150ghs ASIC setup that remains from my hardware sell off.
I've played with cloud services such as cex.io(STAY AWAY), zenminer and pbmining. Zenminer WAS able to make you ROI with about 500$'s worth of investment in the first month or so primarily from Scrypt Mining and I hope their Hashcoin stuff pans out but alas, 7MigratingCoconuts has it right. If you want to mine now, treat it as a hobby and to support the bitcoin network. Making ROI on BTC and other Sha256 coins is nigh impossible these days.
&lt;3 still mining, running a full node and still loving BTC, although when looking at pool payouts from the old days makes me cry.
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:31:06
It seems none of my 800+ btc addresses caught this and i'd totally pay you back, after i pay off my gdamn ez-pass bill. &lt;3
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:24:01
Oi, thank you sir ;). My first changetip too! Also, I believe its all over this post now but I saw most of your responses, just pm me a name and address where you want one of these usb miners sent, i'll work out the shipping costs for each person(trying to get the wife to use her works machine for free *fingers crossed*) but in the event we have to cover it, no chance its going over 5$ priority flat rate for shipping. Also to the fellow in the UK, I'd be more than happy to help get one over to you as well so just contact me. I'll even tell you how to overclock them as well. :) 
Also, I just wanted to say thank you to the community as a whole. I was having a really crap week, well last 3 months to be more accurate and all of the bright eyed and bushy tailed folks sending me nice messages interesting in learning how to mine really gave me a weird sense of calm and community. I hope you all enjoy these miners and keep bitcoin going strong!!

You sound like me whining about not dropping more into mining 2 years ago. Guess what? noone gives a shit. Noone gave a shit when i got gox'd, dicked over during the 1k rise, raped by BFL or lost 3 btc to 50btc.com when they were owned.
Thankfully my wife regulates my dumb ass, only lets me buy mining equipment with money WE COULD AFFORD TO LOSE, handles all of the calculations to ensure we will make ROI and then handles my blowouts with blowjobs when I'm like "omg woman if you just let me sink all of our dough into this when they were 30$ a pop we'd be rich!! God dammit!". 
My advice? eat the green play dough.

Also, is it just me and my angry sadistic and slightly sociopathic tendencies or does that picture they keep using of him with the dead eyes and his magic player haircut make anyone else feel strongly about shanking him in the throat with a broken glass bottle?

I'd rather not have to foot the bill for his prison stay though I'm pretty sure a small amount of BTC can cover the cost of a prison hit. Hell would probably only cost a few cases of ramen.

Wow, it's pretty damn sad how much this was trolled down and that the pic of her holding her paper BTC savings wallet she got for her birthday was removed. The kid in questions is my daughter and we did finally give her a proper introduction of how bitcoin works by ordering most of the presents she wanted for her birthday this year with BTC. Utilizing BTC for most of her Birthday presents with her in tow lead to a few long discussions which was us essentially explaining to her all of the basic, how blocks are found, how bitcoins are made and where they come from and why people prefer it to paper money.
After our talk she was extremely excited and began researching bitcoin on her own, and more recently digging up any and all toy/game sellers who accept it, thankfully the linux mint machine she is limited to didn't pick up any malware when she stumbled across a huge collection of BTC faucets. Since then she has made her own software wallet with Bitcoin-QT which she is calling her "shopping" wallet and asked that we give her an allowance in bitcoin's directly to her "shopping wallet", but for "big things like christmas" to just put money on her paper wallet. I am insanely proud of my kid and wish that I had her mind and attitude towards saving for the future at her age.
I explained that she was still a little too young for an allowance but that we could give her 2 of daddies "little bitcoin miners" and explained that they will slowly make Bitcoin's for her as long as they are on. I explained that she might get as little as a few dollars every few weeks though this didn't worry her as she said she thinks it could be worth "zillions of dollars one day". I have since put a X11 session window up on a monitor in her room showing the output of her two miners so she can watch them work with a little python ticker using the api for her pool on top showing how much BTC she has earned and how much is is worth at her exchange, coinbase. 
Since us giving her a paper wallet and getting her involved in btc she has become a bit more addicted than daddy is when it comes to crypto currency and has started to ask the clerk's in each store we visit if they take bitcoin now. Honestly, i might start using her to strike up conversations about setting up bitcoin integration for some of these peoples businesses. I just find it hilarious watching an 8 year old walk up to a guy at the radioshack counter with a soldering iron and 2 hexbugs in hand, asking if they accept bitcoin and then rolling her eyes when they say no and walking away. I honestly think we've created a monster but I couldn't be more proud of her. So here is hoping her goals remain the same and she still intends to win a nobel peace price when she grows up because i swear if she does start amassing a btc fortune and tries to spend it on stupid shit when she hits her teens im locking those private keys in a safe deposit box until puberty/stupidity is over.
Also, since we're on the topic does anyone know of some good sites swith games similar to say Animal Jam or really any cutesy/rpg style games that accept BTC for payment?
And finally to all the troll's and naysayers this was not put up as a "beg" or a plz give me money so i can learn to make potato salad type post. We simply wanted to share our daughters recent bitcoin enlightenment with the rest of the community because this is something we would love to see ourselves and also posted in hopes to find more kid friendly BTC resources and spark some conversations with out crypto nerd parents.
Thank you to all the folks who have posted positive comments.

As a security analyst who has managed some of the biggest website based compromises across his customer base, I dont think I will ever stop suggesting users employ Adblock + NoScript especially considering in each of these significant attacks the source of the exploit code and or malware was served directly from the ad server. Hell even openx is still widely abused for inserting malicious ad's into sites as popular as msn.com so suck it.

Same but mine hasn't been the same since the big $1200 peak and fall, so i sleep with one eye open. I'm all in for sure and have been for quite some time, just not sure its worth continuing to run my crap mining equipment anymore (jally, antminers, bitfuries and a handful of erupters) or if i should stick with cloud mining @ cex.io. Sadly our gains gave been absolutely minimal or else i would have ordered some proper mining equipment by now. Anyone know if the jallys, furies and antiminers still sell for a decent price on ebay or anywhere else? Should I just go for Scrypt asic's and mine 42 coin? Do i kill the wife and use the insurance money to buy a 50 ths mining farm and if so equipment suggestions? THESE QUESTIONS NEED ANSWERS, HELP ME REDDIT.

same! been trying to help my friend who runs the btcguild.com pool get this botnet kiddie he banned some heavy handed justice as he has been continually ddosing the site until he lets him send his btc mining bots its way. did some detective work, enough to know he can hide his identity and location somewhat, not smart enough to utilize a mixer address though.

Indeed, moving from FailGox to CampBX. Based in the US, Ive tested a bit of their security so far and its great. Also it doesn't hurt that the referral links benefits both the referrer and the referred with 10% off Commissions / fees. CampBX ftw, 
Ya got to love how Mountain of Cox didn't put up a maintenance notification, is now denying the DDoS occurred, refuses to do anything about the droves of market manipulating bots and their micro transactions and suspends trading only a few moments ago till things cool down? Can we say too fucking late late? Fuck Gox we need transparency, Also CampBX is based in the US so if they ever pull this crap it wouldn't be a super expensive plane ticket to go dish out some whoop ass on them.

CampBX for the win, 2 factor Authentication for the win.  10% off commissions if signed up through referal links for you and the person signing up.
Mtgox, suspends trading AFTER DDoS price manipulation mayhem, 2 hours of lag? Acceptable. Getting your money back? Laughable. Their Support? Sucks a 500 lb bag of assorted dicks, mostly from the corpses of AID's patients

These bubbles + coinbase waiting period for insta buys are really killing me. I am just dreading buying coins right now and then watching a drop happen as I wait the 4-5 days to actually USE my BTC and ending up screwed yet again. Anyone know of an instant purchase option that is not localbitcoin, trustworthy and quick? I am still recovering from a big loss from some specific online transactions and have been trying to get myself back up and running again so every 0.1 btc counts. If anyone has any suggestions or is able to sell bitcoins in the Chapel Hill/ Raleigh, NC area and is not a total sketch ball, please hit me up. Looking to buy 1.65 and an additional 1.5. Much love to all of Thanks.

There already are hundreds of variants of wallet stealing trojans, plugins for the major bots that hunt for credentials specific to mtgox, trading sites and online wallets and will immediately exfiltrate them to attackers upon infection. I monitor botnets for a living and almost every botnet we see these days has either bitcoin mining capaibilities or bitcoin wallet/cred jacking features. So i would take those btc offline ASAP to a saved wallet on a usb drive and put it in a safety deposit box or safe if possible, especially that many. If you need any advice on security feel free to message me and good luck with your rents.
