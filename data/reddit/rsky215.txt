Miners also collect a fee for processing the transactions to each block (every 10 minutes or so). This means that even after the rewards run out for solving blocks (how new bitcoins are currently issued) and all 21 million bitcoins have been distributed  by around 2140 miners will still receive compensation in the form of transaction fees for processing transactions into new blocks. Thus, there will still be an incentive correlated to the size of the network, number of transactions, fees, etc.

Important point to take into account - Coinbase's prices include their hedge as well as the influence of off-blockchain activity. I assume circle does as well.  This means their prices will fluctuate specific to activity going on within their own ecosystem.  With such little liquidity there will always be a relatively significant difference in prices.

Your point is 100% correct. While it's not impossible that another "fuel" or solution to cheaply validate transactions could come about, I'm of the opinion that the currency/mining application is the most novel solution out there. They are irrevocably linked and will be forced to grow together.
I've noticed over the past month that it's become "popular" to display favor for the blockchain but not bitcoin. To do so is to completely miss the nature of the technology. In the end, bitcoin is the first successful decentralized autonomous organization. What makes it so amazing is not the value of the currency, rather the ingenious design of a protocol that provides adequate incentives for participation by the necessary parties to make it function effectively. (i.e. nodes, miners, users, peripheral organizations, innovators, etc.)

COINBASE operates off-blockchain. They charge 1% to get in or out of their system (they then buy or sell off of exchanges). But beyond this, your other activity is kept off blockchain. This is part of the reason you might find their prices slightly off from exchanges like bit stamp. Similarly it is why thwy may  be the first company to enable micro transactions (off blockchain)

There is a big difference between an address and an account. The 41 million blockchain addresses are only addresses and do not represent wallet holders. Often times a transactions generates a new "address" for one-time use. Most of addresses on the blockchain are as such, one time use like a tissue. The quote from your reference indicates this:
"As of 9 July 2014, there were almost 41 million addresses listed on the Bitcoin block chain, but only 1.6 million that contained a balance of more than 0.001 bitcoins (roughly £0.35). "
Also - coinbase only reports 1.9 million wallets on their site, nowhere near 7 million.
In reality - painlord2k statements above are most accurate, somewhere between 1 and 5 million. Of that, only about 11,000 individuals with significant holdings. Here's a good thread on wallets and holders:

I go into detail on this subject on my blog here:
As of right now the primary use-case where bitcoin could provide real savings is for amounts of $300 or less. Ultimately, the majority of people sending such small increments would be the worlds poorest workers that are living paycheck to paycheck and just getting by. In this way, in bitcoins current state it's actually still cheaper to send remittances of $300 or more via traditional money transmitters like Western Union.
Thus - for the poorest who have to send $300 or less bitcoin is a better option. For larger amounts its still more sensible to send via traditional remittance providers. 
This doesn't take into the account of convenience. Once we have 2-way ATMs with added features and more liquid markets where their are actual exchanges I'm imagining many more legitimate (and illegitimate) providers will step in to undercut the other rates.

That sounds pretty sensible.  I would agree that any platform introducing common sense discussion on bitcoin/crypto should be viewed as a positive.  The vast majority of folks in the real world are not reddit'ers.  Similarly the vast majority are also not Joe Rogan podcast listeners.  I think anything that starts to bridge the gap is great (as imperfect as some may perceive it) and Real Time would still be a hedge towards mainstream platforms (while still being far from it).  
All that said - I think what's most important is he's a hell of a speaker on the topic and should be supported by the community.

This chart and your comments miss the point as it tries to look at "fairness" rather than utility. Bitcoin is not meant to be a "redistribution" of wealth. Rather it is a new platform for storing value and transacting.
The first person to determine that gold was a good store of value, likely collected a lot and benefited from it. This doesn't make me believe gold is a poor store of value or that it is "unfair" in any way.
The currency application of bitcoin works as such that if bitcoin were to truly be adopted each added participant would gain the utility of a better form of money that is predictable and  can't be manipulated. If I were the last person on earth to adopt bitcoin I'd still get the benefits and utility of a better form of money even if missing out on potential gains in value.

So, say I released a simple little poker game application that was designed to be decentralized but operated with bitcoin.

While I believe you are right about Western Unions business, you make good points, I would tend to disagree that people lack the means or understanding to replace it with bitcoin, people are very resourceful. I believe industrious people who do have bank accounts will solve this issue once liquidity becomes available and undercut Western Union, acting as new cheaper intermediaries. If you've traveled internationally you know this is a competitive landscape. Once people realize the guy across the street will give them 10% more for their remittance than Western Union people will understand pretty quickly.

You miss the premise of my proposal, as well as the core semblance of sarcasm in its title - It is a system designed to accept the reality (desperate people will gamble when given the opportunity and states won't stop promoting such practices) and replaces it with a preferred system that actually fights itself. (lottery proceeds that benefit the alternative motive).
Your argument (though I would agree is in the right spirit - I also hate predatory loan practices) has absolutely no basis on the ideas I've proposed.
Stating that predatory loans are "evil" while predatory lottery practices are an "individual choice" is like saying a fishing lure is "unfair" but live bait is "the fishes choice".

This all boils down to liquidity. Once there are viable exchanges in developing nations the infrastructure will come in the following forms:

I would agree - in this specific case I think there are misconceptions about the present realities of the potential for bitcoin to disrupt the remittances market. Western Union has certainly been vilified (likely unfairly) for simply operating their business on the existing rails to the best of their ability. Do predatory practices exist? Probably in some cases, but the majority of their business provides a service desperately needed by those using it.
I think the conclusions of my post on my blog give this better context.

Coinbase actually allows everything you're asking for:
iOS App with balance displayed:
Mint.com Coinbase balance integration instructions:
You could also just use their non-native app Coinbasis for balance check and dollar/cost averaging:
2-Factor Authentication Preferences:
Next time you login click the "Don't ask me for the code again for 30 days when I use this computer" checkbox and you won't have to re-enter your 2FA code for 30 days.
Hope this helps. Coinbase is a leader.

All about liquidity. There are a huge number of exchanges in un-served bitcoin markets that are in the works and trying to get going and the big boys Coinbase, Circle will continue to expand. The second an exchange opens in a developing nation it will take little time for bitcoin to displace Western Union.
I guarantee there will be industrious entrepreneurs starting their own remittance businesses with nothing more than a smartphone, some cash, and a chair (i.e. sitting in front of Western Union brick and mortar locations and eating their lunch)

I used to work for the Juran Institute - our founder Dr. Joseph Juran coined the term Pareto Principle and I've seen many examples of how it plays out in nature and society. That being said, it is not a concrete principle, not everything breaks down 80/20. It is just a common observation that can be made in many systems.
I think this most applies to bitcoin in terms of ownership. Interestingly enough bitcoin is scarce (just like the amount of real estate in Italy that inspired the principle) and in that way there will always be a varied degree of distribution. Right now I imagine the scales tipped in favor of the 'richest' bitcoiners even further (Top 500 addresses alone own almost 30% of all coins:  but would imagine as adoption / dispersion occurs this will balance out more towards an 80/20 scale in the long run.
With that said, I imagine this playing out in bitcoin/crypto in a number of other ways. I could imagine:
80% of value being stored in 20% of cryptocurrencies/protocols
80% of ownership by 20% of owners
80% of lost bitcoins by 20% of the holders
80% of trading on 20% of exchanges
80% of trades by 20% of traders

Coinbase will let you control your keys via their multi-soh vault feature. Not many people recognize this - you should check it out. Maybe once everyone realizes this people will appriciate how much they're doing.
What they are really doing is making Bitcoin accessible to the everyday person, not just tech enthusiasts, while also expanding its utility (increasing liquidity in international markets - solving the remittances problem) and also indulging their blockchain savvy users (multisig vault)
@_date: 2015-02-20 01:28:21
My advice - use Coinbase, most reliable thus far. Once purchased send the bitcoin to the free Vault associated with your account.
They also offer an even more secure option of a multi-sig vault. If holding long-term learn about this option and consider putting a large portion into multi-sig so that you own your own keys.
