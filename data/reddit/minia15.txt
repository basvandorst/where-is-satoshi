This is a serious question. You are essentially saying people who paid with bitcoin are dumb. If everyone listened to you and nobody ever used bitcoin then wouldn’t it be worthless. Isn’t the value as a currency?

What issues are there with PayPal?

I thought bitcoin was a currency? If everyone is simply investing in it as opposed to using it then what is the point?

You'd just look in the mirror at your real boobs?

Why don't more people do this, seems like a quick way to make money. I mean I was looking at two sites prices 10 min ago and they were like 120$ apart.

Anybody who says they know anything about Bitcoin proves they are an idio
"I know that I know nothing" - Yay Socrates knows everything about Bitcoins

I think in some ways its does. I think many people are buying bitcoins with hopes that it will jump from its current price to 50k, and then they will sell.
But I also think a fair amount of people are invested in Bitcoins as a long-term strategy. I think people (myself included) see the potential of Bitcoins beyond the speculative bubble and are willing to hold their bitcoins rather than dump them with each jump in price. 
In my opinion it really comes down to how fast startups can implement bitcoins into everyday life, and how quickly they can become mainstream. People will only be willing to hold bitcoins for so long if they cannot buy anything with them. 
So in this sense, Bitcoin as the first mover does have the advantage because it has the advantage over others because it is being implemented into other businesses. Once they are integrated with Bitcoin they will not integrate with others.

I like the picture...not whats happening to bitcoins tho
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:10:12
873....making me sad cause i bought my first bitcoins 4 days ago and they arent even verified so I couldnt even sell if i wanted.
I just get to sit and wait for my investment to become worth less and wish id waited a week to buy them.
edit: I wonder if there is a way to cancel my transaction and rebuy them at the lower price, doubtful i guess
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:26:42
Yea makes sense. I guess I was assuming it would be a quick flip
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:51:16
I thought the chicken came first?
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:19:56
Just asked this question as to why people don't buy on one site, then sell on another. Seems odd
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:01:43
So there are actual charts of the the pricing of bitcoin yet we are making our own to suit how we wish bitcoin to be perceived? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:11:06
happened to me...eventually i got through. not sure what i did different..

If your willing to spend 10,000 on bitcoins atleast do the research to know something about them, and know how to buy them
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:55:33
I assume this offer will stand for eternity? I may take you up on it someday depending on the bitcoin price
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:05:16
Same position. waiting for my .6 to clear and wanted to buy some when it was around 850...or even right now!...but alas I have to wait another day for my transaction to clear
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:41:04
what is a good price to buy at?
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:26:00
Makes sense, and interesting little read. Thanks for the response!
I figured it couldnt be as simple as it was in my mind.
