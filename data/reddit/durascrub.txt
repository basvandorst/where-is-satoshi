Depends which Bitcoin 2 you’re talking about. I believe there is a stand-alone BTC2 and a BCH SLP token of Bitcoin called Bitcoin 2. I would hold neither, but the latter has surprisingly proven itself useful when using Sideshift.ai.

Interesting. Cash App has always been the cheaper option in my experience compared to the CB app. There is a 1.2% spread on the purchase of BTC an no other fees (no exchange fee, debit card fee, and they cover the miner's fee upon withdrawal--which is instant).

Yes. Similar ACH clearing times for your funds to be available. You need some foresight and planning to take advantage of the lower trading fees and no withdrawal fees on CB Pro. If you plan on buying once a week, you could initiate a deposit every Friday and buy with the funds from the prior week’s deposit.

It should not be this much fun to push your buttons and hear you regurgitate random virtue-signaling insults (“boomer”, “12 year old”, “no coiner”). The more you talk, the more obvious it is that you have zero real-world experience in anything.
Your statements re: debt pretty much prove this. It really has nothing to with the dollar amount of your supposed debt. Check out Dave Ramsey if you need a basic financial education. How do you have such an inflated sense of self worth from your role as a trader when you cannot even manage your personal finances?
You are someone who has way too much time on their hands and only a cursory knowledge of the subjects where you claim to have some sort of competency. Maybe it works on Reddit where most people are only glossing over people’s posts, but I imagine you have not come to terms with your own meager influence in the real world.
Here is some free advice though. Don’t be a pussy and run from your problems. You will just go from one smoldering wreck to another. Learn some self discipline, save some money, and settle your debts as advantageously as possible. Do that, then feel free to become a mountain man, Bitcoin-derivatives trader.

You copped to be a noob...no need to be downvoted for asking a question. The system does break if a competitive fee market does not exist. There is and will only ever be limited block space. At the same time the block reward for miners is cut in half every 4 years. Competition over limited block space is what will fund the miners to keep the chain secure. Users outbidding each other for faster confirmations is the name of the game. There are other approaches to how Bitcoin should scale, but DYOR and they come with their own issues.

"Wealthy" people do not typically hold their wealth in cash. It is likely kept in equities, real estate, and other things that either generate income or maintain value. Many also possess a discrete skill or degree that guarantees a reliable and generous income. If the world switched to Bitcoin tomorrow, the 1% likely wouldn't change too much.
Despite the promise of being part of the global elite by holding just one Bitcoin, most people will probably start selling long before we hit $100,000. The current 1% will be the ones holding those full Bitcoins if/when it becomes a global reserve currency.

Compared to Coinbase: The spread is a little bid wider, but there are no separate fees. You end up with more BTC/$ with Square than with Coinbase. You will also be allowed to withdrawal your BTC immediately with Square; whereas with Coinbase you will have to pay an additional fee to do that. Square is the way to go.

I’d like to put a vote in for the Cash App when it comes to buying. Functionality is limited beyond that, but you’re able to purchase BTC at similar spreads, with less fees, and at greater speeds than with CB.
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:10:29
Although I’m not smart enough to take my own advice, it’s probably worthwhile to keep some fiat in you CB account, and transfer to CB Pro when you’re ready to make a buy. You will save 1-2% when doing that over buying with the Cash App.

Since people will counter with the “dollar is backed by gold” argument (although it isn’t), I would talk to them about Gold. Gold was one of the very first metals that humans learned how to extract from the earth. What really made gold unique was that it was limited in supply in comparison to other metals. This scarcity allowed gold to serve as sound money, in addition to also being fungible, durable, divisible, etc.
Gold was obviously not valued over the ages because it was a good conductor of electricity. Industrial use of gold today only affects a small portion of gold demand. People also desire gold for jewelry and decoration, but this demand overlaps with what makes gold a form of sound money.
While gold has filled these roll very well historically, it is ultimately not “backed” by anything. It’s price, like everything else on the planet, is derived from the intersection of supply and demand (assuming no interference in the marketplace). This is no different than Bitcoin. 
Gold has been in use for thousands of years, so the people you are talking to do not question why it has value. Bitcoin is only ten years old, but it has the possibility of becoming a modern version of gold. It is scarce like gold and has all the other attributes of sound money. It may not have industrial use, but it will allow humans to transact in a way that has never been possible. Some would argue that Bitcoin is a better form of gold because it does not need to be stored in a steel vault in order to protect it and can be sent halfway around the world at a moments notice.
I think the biggest barrier for people to accept these arguments is that they cannot “hold” a physical Bitcoin like they can hold a gold eagle or a gold necklace. Some of these people will never be able to comprehend that Bitcoin is the very first digital asset that can in fact be “owned” by someone. It is not a mp3 that can be replicated endlessly. It is protected by cryptography, but it’s ownership can be actively traded. A Bitcoin that is in someone’s wallet is no different than a gold coin in that person’s pocket. Future generations will acclimate to the idea of “owning” something digital.
Hopefully that gives you some ammunition for the naysayers. 
TLDR Buy and hold Bitcoin, gold(, and silver)....��

I remember working for a company that started having “cash-flow issues”. We were one of the three largest players in our industry across a region of the US. It never really sunk in that the giant behemoth we worked for could ever just dissolve into oblivion. We were also fed a pretty steady diet of bullshit from the owners that seemed to explain away every hiccup.
One day the CEO, who had a substantial equity stake in the company too, disappeared and no one has heard from him since. That same day we were introduced to a team of consultants hired by the bank. Several months later the company was gone.
While I really do think Gemini is a healthy business run by people who care about compliance, I 100% understand how certain financial problems can trigger some alarm bells...deserved or not.

BRD wallet is scam? I'm really not sure what you are referring to. Keys are stored on your device and not on anyone's servers. BRD wallet also gives you the option to connect to your own Bitcoin node or a random network node (as opposed to a BRD node). There are no accounts. I don't think it can get much better for a mobile wallet. I have to imagine there have been scam copies of it though.
Added: the only think I don't like about it is that it only gives you two options for setting fees ("Regular" and "Economy"). I can give it a partial pass here because "Economy" seems to default to 1 Satoshi/Byte, which is what I use. The Loaf Wallet for LTC is a clone of BRD.
Another Added: Code is open source.

I think a better example would be the miner that dumped tens of millions into a mining farm and who may be comfortable running a deficit for a while to see what happens to the price of BTC. Most BTC miners are not hobbyists. This miner might also be flush with cash after the 2017 bull run and/or is able to raise private capital/borrow money to help cover the gaps. Obviously this miner’s luck could eventually run out, but that’s not the point here. We were talking about who would continue to mine for BTC when buying it outright would be a better value proposition.

General knowledge:
One pays an initial on-chain fee to fund a payment channel on the Lightning Network. On-chain BTC fees will vary depending on current demand for blockspace and the user's time preference. For most users this will be in the $0.02-$2.00 range.
Now that the channel is funded, OP can make make as many payments he wants at sub-cent fees provided he has enough money in the channel.

Those people thought they were investing geniuses for 10X their money. That's definitely a great deal, but Bitcoin is now worth $8000 and was as high as $20,000 at one point.
I don't think you should put any money into any type of investment until you can understand the risks, especially one as volatile as Bitcoin. After all, you failed to consider the possibility that an investment could go down in value. Additionally, you would have to consider trading fees, order book spread, and the responsibility of keeping this money safe from thieves and hackers.
Even if you were convinced that Bitcoin will be worth more in the future, there is a saying that goes "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." I would wager that most people have lost money investing in Bitcoin even though just buying and holding would have put them in the green. 
Are you willing to watch your investment halve in value and wait three years before you are potentially at break-even again? Are you willing to lose a few points on your money just from hitting the buy button? How do you feel about having your account hacked and the funds irretrievably stolen forever? Are you prepared to manage your private keys or risk losing your money forever?

“Showing up instantly” just means that your transaction has been distributed to nodes around the world. Mining nodes will take these unconfirmed transactions and prepare them into a block. Blocks occur on average every 10 minutes. 
Whether you see an unconfirmed transaction or not is largely dependent on the wallet or exchange you are using. Some won’t display an unconfirmed transaction and will require a certain number of confirmations before it pops up.
At this point in Bitcoin’s lifecycle, all transactions will the minimum fee will eventually be confirmed. The amount of space in each block is limited, so it is possible that a transaction will not be confirmed until the number of transactions with higher relative fees have cleared though.
I hope this answers your question.

My guess is that the business who put this sign up has issues beyond the credit card companies. They do leach a few points from the merchant, but this cost is usually passed on to the consumer and the merchants can be paid pretty quickly these days. The system is definitely antiquated though.
Hearing about “cash-flow issues” from a business sets off so many alarm bells in mind. From experience I can tell you it probably has more to do with management than it does with some third party payment processor.

Stick to your plan. Why make one in the first place if you're going to second guess it? You are obviously not a day trader or swing trader, so abandoning your sensible plan of dollar-cost averaging and trying to time the market is pretty silly.
You have probably heard the meme that "everyone who bought Bitcoin except for this X month period are in profit". The reason I call it a meme and don't take it very seriously is because nobody actually hodls on their first go round. Everyone gets bullish on the green days and bearish on the red days. This leads to some serious overtrading and another meme: "90% of traders are unsuccessful".

Please take the time to do some research and store your Bitcoin in a proper wallet, e.g. Ledger hardware wallet combined with the Electrum desktop wallet or a mobile wallet like GreenAddress, BRD. There is definitely some stuff to do beyond that, but these would be good first steps. Then you will never have to worry about a service shutting down and losing access to your money.

You read stories of early adopters people becoming Bitcoin millionaires and you feel that you have no other prospects in life to create wealth, so you decided to bet it all on black after it hit on the last spin for somebody else. 
The beauty of moonshot, once-in-a-lifetime, eye-watering exponential gain scenarios is that you don't have to go all in to benefit immensely. You just need to buy a ticket. If you feel as strongly as you do about Bitcoin, feel free to allocate a little more capital to it, butthat shouldn't come at the expense of all rational planning.

cash app cash app cash app cash app......is the fastest and cheapest way to buy BTC. There is perhaps two ways to buy BTC cheaper, but it will not be instant. I can't think of any other way that is faster. You pay a very fair 1.2-1.3% premium over the cash spot price of BTC. Withdrawals are free. There is no waiting for funds to clear. The only downside is KYC....but that is becoming the reality one must deal with.
Perhaps the ONLY better scenario would be if you knew someone who was willing to sell to you at spot price with cash.
Added: I have no experience with the sell side, but that is a lot easier to figure out when the time comes. Withdraw funds into your own wallet.

Most of them either went to school for a high-paying profession or (the really rich ones) started a business doing something incredibly mundane (but did it well). Just some food for thought.

You can do both. The only caveat is that you cannot deposit back into the wallet (so the BTC you withdraw cannot be redeposited at a later date and sold).
Cash App is IMHO the best way to buy Bitcoin for the average Joe. The best place to sell Bitcoin is another topic entirely. I wouldn’t get hung up on having everything within one app, because you’re not a trader (and therefore won’t be buying and selling frequently).
First vote for selling would be through a private sale.
Second place would belong to Coinbase Pro.
Seriously though...everyone should give Cash App a whirl for buying Bitcoin.  If not, I will leap through the goddamn internet and kick them in the teeth. Just kidding (no I’m not).

I like to compare running a node to getting vaccinated. One person getting vaccinated helps society only marginally, but that person now benefits from not having to worry about certain illnesses. When a certain percentage of the population receives vaccination though, herd immunity is achieved and the benefits of vaccination extend even to people who never received the immunization.
One additional person running a node doesn't provide a massive benefit to the network, but that person is now able to verify their own transactions without sharing their wallet info with a third-party. When enough people run a node, it becomes impossible for a malicious node operator to affect a meaningful portion of the network. Even SPV users benefit from the network reaching a critical mass of full nodes.

Spend some time on Bitcoin.org reading through their Bitcoin guides. The possibility of messing something up and losing your Bitcoin certainly exists, but it is not really not that difficult at the end of the day. It requires only some thoughtful attention and a little education.
***With that said, play around with small amounts until you are comfortable with the process.***
Some things to look out for:
1) Scam wallets. This is more of an issue if you are on PC or Android, but can be a possibility on iOS as well (stay away from “Freewallet”!!!!). Use the BRD wallet if you want a mobile wallet. 
***The best bet would be to buy a Ledger Nano S directly from Ledger’s website if you want the security of a hardware wallet.***
2) Inputting correct addresses. The concern isn’t necessarily that you will mess up one number or letter. The problem is if malware replaces a legitimate address that you copied to your clipboard and you paste, send without paying attention. The solution here is not to have to have malware and to pay attention to what your are doing. 
Another potential issue is accidentally entering a Bitcoin Cash or SV address as the receiving address. Once again, pay attention to what you are doing and you will be fine.
3) Losing your seed phrase and/or wallet password. Seed phrases and passwords should be written down and stored somewhere safe. Preferably in more than one place. Make sure they are correct, safe, and hidden. Do not use screenshots or store in a file on your pc, phone, the cloud.
4) Poor understanding of fees. This is probably the most difficult one for a beginner, but also one where the stakes are not usually as high. Possible scenarios would involve sending a fee that is too low for an urgent payment OR unnecessarily paying too much for a transaction. This is more a quality of life/usability issue than a security issue. 
That definitely ended up being longer than I though, but do not be discouraged. None of these things have ever happened to me. Spend some time reading up on these things and you will be fine. Start with trivial amounts and you will be fine. Good luck!

I'm not really sure if I experienced a bug, a disconnection from the peer, or I plain messed up. I was definitely running on emotion and not thinking things through. I am sorry this got long, but I'm hoping to learn a thing or two in the process.
This person has a decent amount of BTC locked up in 40 channels.
To the best of my recollection this is what happened. It is very possible that I am making half of this stuff up.
Autopilot linked me up with him. After 2 confirmations, the circle next to "X% on Lightning" went bright green. The channel funding transaction status was still listed as "unconfirmed" despite the 2 on-chain confirmations and the app's indications that I was otherwise good to go.
I put the phone down and came back less than an hour later. If I remember correctly that same circle was a duller shade of green. When I went to the channels screen, I noticed that the node was listed as inactive. I waited over an hour with the app open as much as possible, hoping that I would be able to reconnect. The log showed that the app was repeatedly trying to receive some kind of response from the peer node regarding the funding transaction that never came.
After a while I decided to force close the channel. 99% of the log entries after that were about creating a "NurseryReport" and every so often it would let me know that there has not yet been a response from the other node. 144+ blocks later I was able to send my money out to a different wallet.
The sequence of transactions was also a bit strange post closing. There are 6 transactions listed in the app:
1. Fund LND Wallet
2. Fund Channel
3. Close Channel
4. Send to bc1 address
5. send to bc1 address
6. Withdraw money from LND Wallet.
I'm not clear on why transactions 4 and 5 were necessary. Why would the outputs of the closing transaction not be immediately spendable? It was an extra couple dollars in fees for those txs. Transactions 3 and 6 are listed as unconfirmed in-app, even though that is not the case.
If you've made it this far, I commend you.
Edited for derp.

The article addresses why the Mavericks accept BTC for ticket purchases. I wouldn't call him a hypocrite because of that.  
Although he doesn't have an expert-level understanding of Bitcoin, that doesn't make some of his criticisms any less valid. This is a man that didn't need Bitcoin to become wealthy. I question how many of us would be as enamored with cryptocurrency if we didn't believe in some promise of future wealth.  
Articles like this shouldn't get anyone worked up. Bitcoin either fulfills its promise as a decentralized currency or it doesn't. Bitcoin has made some amazing progress in the past 10 years, but it is nowhere close to the point where it starts to prove the naysayers wrong.

I am making no predictions about Bitcoin’s future. I would not consider Bitcoin a success until the exponential price movements are a thing of the past. There are definitely some caveats to that definition, but the idea is that it has reached critical mass in terms of adoption. Adoption could mean global currency; or it could mean niche financial asset. Bitcoin could also fizzle and die.

Forget about fractional reserve for a second and think about financialization. Wall Streets biggest money makers are products that promise the same underlying asset to multiple parties.

There’s nothing stopping the banks from doing the same thing with Bitcoin and there are no laws against it.

I wouldn’t say that they learned “the hard way”. Nchain’s 32MB blocks were not created from transactions in the wider mempool. They generated their own transactions and then broadcast the block to the network. There were block propagation issues that resulted from this and caused some nodes with lower memory to crash.  Given the circumstances, I think the only thing that we learned was that Nchain is a bunch of morons who have more money than sense...but we already knew that.
Naturally created blocks started having issues after 21-22MB. This is based on the gigablock test net and the BCH stress tests from August. ABC’s roadmap is focused on addressing the limitations in the software that cause this before increasing the cap further; whereas CSW’s SV software  went straight for another block size increase to 128MB.

I don’t think it should come as a surprise to Kraken or their bank that someone involved in Bitcoin pre 2013 would now have a considerably more money than when they started.
I’m willing to bet that the overwhelming majority of customers would describe their source of funds as “investment” money. $10,000 of Bitcoin at the bottom of the last bear market would be worth over a quarter million today. I’m not even touching on the possibility that someone bought XRP or ETH at fractions of a cent and traded them during the last bull market.

As to your first point...I don’t see how what you said contradicts with what I said. My point is that that it would impractical for the average Joe to store his traditional wealth without some kind of custodial service; whereas, it is possible with Bitcoin (as you point out).
As to your second point...it really doesn’t bother me in the slightest that the majority Bitcoin holders may not use a proper wallet and cede control to traditional financial institutions...so long as I can. The protocol is designed to resist the type of censorship you are taking about. If it can’t, then Bitcoin is nothing more than a flash-in-the-pan techie fad.
The existence of prominent custodial services for Bitcoin and the “be your own bank” mindset are not mutually exclusive options. I think the former will bolster the latter significantly. 
Institutional interest in Bitcoin is a good thing. It means Satoshi created something that people value. If you want to evangelize the benefits of a running a full node, maintaining decentralized development teams, well-distributed hashing power, etc, then I am all with you; but I disagree that third-party custodial services for Bitcoin are a product of the anti-Bitcoin cabal. I think it represents progress for the protocol.

I think those stories say more about their ambition, risk appetite, and ability to leverage their profits from a speculative investment into a new venture. Bitcoin played an important role, but I would never tell someone that Bitcoin is the secret ingredient for success.
How many early Bitcoin visionaries are there that are now fabulously wealthy compared to the number of people who “mined it in 2009”, but lost their wallet?  Or sold it at $30 and bought a Civic after doubling their money? Or had to sell at a loss to pay bills? I would wager that the number of success stories in Bitcoin likely mirrors the number of success stories in more traditional industries.
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:21:50
I think people make the mistake of thinking that Bitcoin has “made it” or that it has somehow skipped 50 years of adoption and development. It is still new. It is still in early development and cannot support a large number of users. The market is global, but illiquid. Bitcoin is useful if you need to immediately move your money out of the local banking system (Cyprus, China, Argentina, etc) and there have been some correlated pumps, BUT Bitcoin is not yet a global reserve asset, a recognized safe haven, or a long-term store of value like gold (despite the crazy price appreciation).

That article was a little sensational. Of course there are rocks hurdling through space that contain gold and other elements. The problem is that mining these asteroids is still in the realm of science fiction. Even if it were technically possible, it would still have to be more cost efficient than mining here on earth. I would guess we are a century or two from that point, but I doubt it will be in our lifetimes.
Then consider the possibility of a zero-day exploit or bug in the Bitcoin code. It happened once in the very early days and others have fortunately been discovered before they can be exploited. What do you think would happen now if there was a well-publicized double spend or inflation bug?

A zero-day exploit will always pose an existential threat to Bitcoin. 
Gold's zero-day exploit is when people figure out how to make it in a lab for less than it costs to mine. Or when humans figure out how to bring it back from space for less than it costs to mine it here on earth. 
I like both, but if I had to choose one based on longevity alone, it would be gold.

1. Blockchain is not a bad wallet. Keep in mind that even though it may look like a “web wallet”, you are responsible for protecting your own keys. They cannot recover your account if you lose you keys. Protecting your keys is part of basic Bitcoin literacy. I would avoid using the Blockchain wallet because they have yet to to integrated some efficiency updates that were added to Bitcoin a couple of years ago.
Wallet Option 1: Bitcoin Core. If you are technically literate and really want to learn as much as you can about Bitcoin, then you should run a Bitcoin Full Node. You will need a decent internet connection and around 250GB of hard drive space. If you eventually want to put more than $25-50 into Bitcoin, then I would keep your full node, but upgrade to a solution that involves a hardware wallet.
Wallet Option 2: Electrum Bitcoin Wallet
Electrum may not seem like it is the most beginner-friendly option, but I think it’s important to familiarize yourself with a wallet that allows for a lot of granular control. You will be able to generate seed phrases for offline storage, have full control over fees, be able to create legacy and segwit-style wallets, and more importantly you will familiarize yourself with concept of UTXOs (aka “coins”). Bitcoin does not have an account system, but many wallets make it seem that way. Electrum will give you an idea of how the system functions. It will be worth the extra bit of research. If you decide to put more money into Bitcoin, then you can use a hardware wallet to secure your Electrum wallet and even link it to your full node.
Wallet Option 3: Blockstream Green
This is the best mobile wallet for Bitcoin in my opinion. It is open source, gives you a decent amount of control, and has some cool features like 2FA.
Wallet Option 4: Trust Wallet
Not much to say here other than it is put out by Binance, offers support for multiple currencies, supports native Segwit, and is generally easy to use.
If you are in the US, then I would recommend using the Cash App as a means of acquiring Bitcoin. It is the cheapest and fastest way of acquiring BTC. Other options are either slower or more expensive.
Good luck.

I always thought the distinction between "private" and "anonymous" was pretty obtuse. Whether we like it or not, chain analysis companies are a lot more sophisticated than what you think and law enforcement is a lot better at their jobs than what you give them credit for.

Sure, but those opportunities diminish the longer the ecosystem exists.

....it still allows YOU to be your own bank. I think it’s ridiculous to keep LARGE amounts of paper money or precious metals in one’s house. Most people do not have the option of being their own bank in that situation, but they certainly can with Bitcoin. What’s the problem with some people choosing to keep their Bitcoin in custodial wallets AND this demand adds value to the Bitcoin people hold privately?

Bitcoin was the very first digital asset that was also scarce, decentralized, and censorship-resistant. It is not just another currency or payment method for these reasons. The best description I have found is digital gold.
If you have an appreciation of gold as a store of value or as a monetary metal, then you should also be able to appreciate Bitcoin for many of the same reasons. It also has the advantage of being able to send it around the globe for a small fee, no middlemen, and payment finality within 10 minutes. 
Why does any of this matter? From an investment perspective, it has a fixed supply and price essentially increases in tandem with user adoption. Adoption right now is basically non-existent. If you think that the market for censorship-resistant digital money will grow in the future, then Bitcoin is likely the best horse to bet on. Bitcoin is also measured in fiat because that is what we are used to using as a unit of account. It is not "based" on fiat.
Gold is more of a hedge against inflation/store of value rather than an investment. Bitcoin aspires to these things, but the market cap is still too small. That potential makes Bitcoin a better "investment" than gold in some respects. Gold has a market cap in the trillions. The amount of value added to the gold market when price increases by a few percentage points is greater than the entirety of Bitcoin's current value. Gold will never 10x in a year after adjusting for inflation because of this.

Unfortunately there aren’t any great ways to do this right now. I would recommend Blue Wallet (custodial LN solution). Setting up one full BTC, LN node and then using Lightning App or Zap Mainnet would be educational, but not the most elegant solution at this point in time.

I don’t think merchant adoption is stupid and disagree with the OP, but....asking some pimply-faced kid making $9/hr about accepting Bitcoin is pointless. Businesses will accept Bitcoin when/where it provides a compelling advantage over local currency. 
Convincing a merchant to give away small amounts of Bitcoin to disinterested customers also seems like a stupid idea though. No one besides 3-4 neckbeard dweebs who already own Bitcoin will show up for the promotion. The other customers who begrudgingly accept the free Bitcoin will lose it in about a week.

I’m trying to figure this one out. Coins should never be lost in the fashion you are describing. The merchant should have the keys to whatever address they presented to you regardless of whether it timed out or if the fees were later updated. Perhaps their front end doesn’t have a UI for this, but I would hope someone in support would be able to help you? So they otherwise have a general ledger category for people whose money they straight up stole?

Consider the likelihood in our lifetime of humans mining gold in space vs a potential hack or fatal flaw in the Bitcoin network. Both are theoretically possible, but I think the latter is a more credible existential threat.

And here is where you go off the deep end...for the third time: BTC at home = practical.
Coinbase attacking consensus and adoption? Now in my mind I’m calling you an idiot, but I wouldn’t say it out loud until you say something like: “that is proven and admitted. It's not up for debate”. That is the mark of an idiot...someone who can’t sum up their argument in a few sentences.

Don’t get caught up in the hype. These are often very much “buy the rumor; sell the news” type events. Price increases in anticipation of an event, only for price to tank after it happens. The upside is often never as dramatic as people think it will be as as well.
From a technical standpoint we are also approaching a massive downtrend resistance line  created in the past few months as part of a descending triangle. Back in 2018, there were several rallies off of the ~$6000 support line. Each time people said that this rally was the one that would take us to new all-time highs. People also said that $6000 was the guaranteed bottom and Bitcoin would never be below that point again. As you know, price crashed though the $6000 mark last November and a bunch of FOMO buyers were left holding bags from $11700, $10000, $8500, and $7400. Some people probably got rekt each time.
The trend recently has been eerily similar with peaks at $14000, $13300, $12300, and now a couple in the high $10,000s. Price has bottomed around $900-9500 each time. If we broke through and closed above somewhere in the low $11000s, I would start to get bullish. Until that happens, I would be cautious.
“The trend is your friend until the end” and “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes” are two platitudes that you probably want to keep in mind. Is it possible that price explodes 5 minutes from now and it is then twice expensive to buy the same amount of BTC? Of course it’s possible, but I think it’s unlikely. 
At the end of the day you want to establish a long-term position on Bitcoin. You will not time the market correctly and you will experience ups and downs on your portfolio value. If you have the cash on hand and will have some peace of mind that your position is established and you don’t care about short-term movements, then by all means go ahead. Don’t do it because of Bakkt FOMO though. 
Note: I am not a trading expert. I am a normal guy. I am part of the 90% that lost trying to FOMO trade during 2018. At the end of the day, the very small amount of Bitcoin that I own is worth more than when I bought it because I sat through some losses until prices eventually went up.

Even though the spread is a little wider than CB, there are no additional fees tacked on. CB will add a fee for the purchase and another one for using your debit card. This usually translates into more BTC/$. YMMV. There may be a trade off between spread and fees for different dollar amounts.

Hash rate grew well into 2018 as price went the other way. It takes time to get hashing power online. Planning likely began as price was still on a parabolic uptrend. The same applies now. The next thing to consider is the fact that Bitcoin price was/is still up substantially. That means it is still profitable for a larger number of miners.
What it doesn't mean is that miner whales know something we don't and price is about to explode to $100k or that something has fundamentally changed with mining technology. We could see price drop significantly from here and still see hashrate increase.
@_date: 2019-09-02 02:07:44
Definitely agree on government-controlled currencies.
Gold has 5,000+ years of history as a store of value. Bitcoin only has 10.
I also think there is a range of possible scenarios between the status quo and zombie apocalypse. Think of Europe during WW2. I'm sure gold had no value in Moscow in 1942, but it was probably pretty useful if you needed to bribe a soldier or smuggle your wealth from France. You had to carry it on you and protect it from theft, but you also didn't have to worry about access to any special equipment or rely on operational public utilities.
It is possible to love both Bitcoin and gold.

Wrong. Crypto is still high, my friend. BTC can drop by several thousand more dollars and still be higher than where it was at the beginning of 2017. You need to check your FOMO, pay off your debt, and then consider saving for retirement in the form of index funds and bonds. FYI I am very long on BTC, and still recommend that you stay away for now.

We often talk about CSW’s antics, but I don’t think we take it serious enough. From our perspective the truth is obvious; but the truth may not be as obvious to a no-coiner judge somewhere who is listening to a legal time hired by CSW and CA. I think Peter McCormack’s decision to represent himself in court is an example of this (although a number of lawyers have offered to represent him pro bono — he should accept their offers). 
It reminds me of people who watch “know your rights videos” and think that cops are all a bunch of morons. When those people get pulled over they are often not prepared to counter the practiced intimidation that even the dumbest of officers utilize every day.
I don’t know what the practical outcome of CSW  winning a court case will be. It can range from benign bragging rights to miring a legitimate project in litigation for years to ruining someone’s life or the industry entirely. We shouldn’t dismiss potentially dangerous people with a significant amount of motivation and resources.

The chart posted on that page is "exclusive of bullion." The use of gold in industry only makes up a very small fraction of its "use". Utility here likely refers to the fact that Bitcoin can be programmed and isn't encumbered by being a hunk of metal.

This is where I think people are losing sight of the threat posed by CSW. Someone as a joke and to prove that "anyone can get a copyright" will do this only to get served by Craig's legal team. That person will see the whole thing as some stupid college prank, make a bunch of humorous tweets, and decide to represent himself in court should the damn thing ever go to trial (which they think will never happen). CSW's legal team will cherry pick someone with just enough notoriety and not enough sense to assemble any legal representation.
You know what happens next? A team of the best trial lawyers and legal minds on the planet will run a train on that poor, smug bastard's virgin asshole. I don't give a fuck who you are or how smart you pretend to be. Go to court unprepared against people with experience and you will get fucked in the ass until you're left with bleeding, prolapsed anus that looks like a deflated basketball.
You know what happens after that? CSW's claims have now been defended successfully in a court of law. That type of precedent will only snowball unless we start taking this seriously. Let's excise this cancer. This cannot be done by ignoring it or making light of it.

You would have to fund all of those channels. That means tying up non-trivial amounts of money into a network whose software is currently only in beta. You would also have be online and monitor these channels 24/7 because LN watchtowers do not yet exist. Finally, you would have to ultimately convince someone to pay you for those channels when you still hold the private keys.
Don't worry about block size. I get that it would be nice to have some extra capacity now, but not at the risk of a contentious hard fork. Contentious hard forks really really really suck. We will likely reach the point where a block size increase will be necessary and there are proposals that exists now that describe how to do it in a manner that will allow everyone enough time to upgrade.

Yes. Coinbase sources their coins from their exchange, but you will be paying Coinbase a 1.5-10% fee (depending on transaction size), an additional fee if using a debit/credit card, and the  price will be subject to a spread in CB’s favor.

I don’t know about the ETFs and/or trusts.
The open interest on the Comex gold futures is nowhere near a 1:1 basis with what they have in their vaults or with what the short traders are capable of delivering. The “price of gold” as we know it is currently based on  ~52 million ozs worth of paper gold backed by ~7.7 million ozs of real gold. 
I’m only making a positive statement about gold futures paper vs physical ounces. That ratio satisfies the current, minimal demand for physical gold deliveries. If every trader did decide one day to take possession of their gold, there would unquestionably not be enough to go around and price would increase exponentially in an attempt to satisfy the delivery requests.
