No Kim, I don't trust your self-inflated, lying, criminal ass. 
I do believe in Bitcoin as well, but you behind it does not make it any more appealing to me. Maybe even less so.

But as we learned, bubbles require bad news coverage.

I love it when people make wild predictions, because I have accepted this truth and it makes me smile everytime.
@_date: 2016-04-22 21:32:05
Same here, although I use Paypal.
Whenever I want to fill up my Steam credits and the Payal site opens up in the Steam client, which is nothing but an IE under the hood, (in my case, this varies) I always get the "this can't be a good idea" feeling.
@_date: 2016-04-26 04:42:10
Thank you for the update! Are there any plans to give insight into whether enabling Bitcoin was a success a couple months down the road?
I would love to see some numbers and I think Steam is the perfect market to get some insight into how much real world usage Bitcoin actually gets.
Edit: Nevermind, I was blindly assuming a Steam rep. Sorry for the confusion!
@_date: 2016-04-26 05:42:20
True indeed! What I had in mind was mostly the number of purchases made and the percentage a Bitcoin payment gateaway snags up in this market.
A lot of the CS:GO community already uses Bitcoin, and I assume a lot of the trading returns will flow back to Valve for keys and stuff.
It's not really important, because as you said Bitcoin will already benefit from having Valve under its belt. I'd still love to hear Bitcoin taking up a percentage of sales that bears some significance. That would be amazing.

That's exactly what Litecoin did with Segwit and everyone here shoved it into the haters faces when altcoin discussions usually get removed. As Ver said, Litecoin is more of a direct competitor than other alts, yet it was welcomed here. 
Now if Bitcoin Cash does the same thing with Lightning, this is the worst atrocity and proves Ver is the devil himself.
Charlie Lee is probably pissing himself, laughing over the hypocrisy of this gullible community.

Of course they should have done so. Why they didn't is beyond me. Maybe someone can enlighten us.

Yep. I was just trying to highlight that some people take things too serious on here.
@_date: 2018-05-28 05:30:39
Yep, this whole debacle made me walk away from Bitcoin as a whole, no matter what you call Bitcoin. It's sad it has come to that point, been here since 2011 as well. 
The spirit that I fell in love with has moved on to other projects, while everything that now matters here, is proving how superior you are to the other side. Mostly with strawman arguments and manipulation as it appears.

The steady rise in difficulty says otherwise. And even a rise of one order of magnitude, that many here expect to happen within the next year or so, is an investors dream.
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:57:14
Ohhh, okay. Thanks for the explanation. 


The usage example just startled me there. In public, shouldn't we still use the BTC we all know and love?
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:41:09
That'd be my guess as well, but I'd rather see a complete translation than a half assed one in the hopes of sounding more sensationalist.

How do you not know the font if you made this?
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:12:06
The whole unit is a really good idea. But I st ill think the name is terrible. Why overload existing words like that? It's used in IT as well as finances. Now we have BTC, which is both, and we have yet another "bits". 
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:32:37
Considering how much thought went into Bitcoin itself, and how far we've come, we should put more thought into this instead of flocking to the first thing that pops up.

That's less than $18,000/BTC. My guess is yes, easily, unless some altcoin *(or similar)* takes the cake.

Are you saying people will pay me to take their Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:27:18
The amount you can withdraw per day is individual per bank account and can be adjusted with a simple call to your bank (within the limited opening hours) in most cases.
For an account I opened a few weeks back the spending limit per day was set to 2000€, daily withdrawal to 500€, and I was even asked if that was alright.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:48:23
Plus500 has a history of updating their conditions without any notifications whatsoever.
If you still trade there, check the details every time before you buy!
They changed the leverage from 4 with no autosell up to 10 as it stabilized, then went down to 7, 4, 2 and finally 1:1 while the rally lasted, then moved the ladder back up as it fell all the way to 1:10, closed open positions unannounced (no autosell at the time) and moved to monthly autosell somewhere along the way, split their listing into two separate ones, kept changing the conditions.. etc.
All without a single mail or announcement before or after these events.

I like [TradingView](

I dunno about the technical implications why it could be faster as there are a ton of factors to consider and I never used either of these services. But with the size of both companies, I doubt it's a backend thing because both architectures are propably easily scalable and well enough optimized. It's more likely either a latency problem or MS just using a lighter-weight frontend.
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:13:19
The image is Dogecoin, "Bitcoin users potential terrorists?" in the headline, and the "article" talks about cryptocurrency in general. Great news.
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:52:58
Mostly because it happened during a fast moving downtrend. Now we've been rather stable for almost three weeks and it breaks out like that. That's quite a different scenario.

@_date: 2014-09-10 22:57:09
I checked the list against my contacts, all negative. That's also what I read here and on HN. So that's probably what happened.
@_date: 2014-12-25 02:22:09
While the idea is cool and there is general use for this, the advertised examples are the exact opposite of what crypto is aimed for.
I thought it was meant to protect our privacy, not to motivate stalkers to upload "Unflattering celebrity photos and videos" outside of anyones control.
It makes me think of 4chan and their tendency to idolize females that end up posting pictures of themselves there. 
There are mistakes that shouldn't ruin your entire life, and such a platform seems to encourage exactly that to happen as long as *someone* doesn't care about you, which is quite likely to be the case if the 5% psychopath figure is even remotely true.
What they're describing is basically vigilantism.

Even after this gained traction a lot of people won't know about it, or will not check it regularly. 
I think such a platform, an **easily accessible** way to get important information out there anonymously can have a huge positive impact on society on political and corporate scale.
What I am thinking about are the small people. Look at all these sites with "pictures of peoples ex girlfriends". Have you read what it feels like to have this happen to you? To have one of the most intimate things spread across the internet like a bushfire? Places like 4chan, karmawhores on reddit reposting it twice a week, etc. It's bad enough as it is, with no (or barely any) monetary incentive to do that, just because someone got mad at you or someone you thought of as a friend betrayed you.
It's just an example. There are likely more relevant problems this would bring up, that currently affects a fraction of society, but would probably explode if it was a profitable business.
It would definitely be interesting to watch, but I think such a platform has the potential to be the next step to remove the human traits of forgetting and forgiving, and I'm skeptical whether that's something we should want. I really hope there will be better ways to fight corruption.

Dooglus, the site owner, is a good guy. He'll probably block your account/IP if you ask him to.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:52:40
This, most importantly. If he'd rather blame BTC than his failure of an exchange, he should GTFO of the foundation of this oh so bad software.
This guy is no contribution to the community or the foundation whatsoever. The only thing that got him there was the volume of the exchange, which doesn't exist any longer.

Assuming you're using the official Bitcoin client, just get the wallet.dat from your home directory (%appdata%\Bitcoin on Windows) and copy it to the other systems Bitcoin directory.
Edit: I can't spell.. tried my best to fix it.
@_date: 2014-05-03 09:30:16
The order of magnitude is good. But as we move towards computers becoming more and more relvant for the general public, we shouldn't put multiple meanings on such fundamental words.
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:32:47
That probably would have been a marketing nightmare, but with every "future" currency in movies often just being "credits", maybe credits would have made sense.
I do like "Bitcoin", though. I wouldn't want Facebook to be "The social network" or Google being called "Search engine of your choice". 
Bitcoin is a name that is worth of being ubiquitous and a name that, at some point gets associated with "internet money" the same way Google is synonymous with searching stuff on the internet.
@_date: 2014-01-04 12:52:27

Best of luck and keep pushing the boundaries. We need more people like you. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 23:15:01
That's not what I'm implying. I'm saying that being overly pedantic is unnecessarily confusing. Not wrong. And that the terminology we have been using since the inception of Bitcoin supports being less technically correct, which I am in favor of for the sake of accessibility. 
Credit card fraud is fraud, but does not require proof of identity, nor can I take my bank account with me since it's a non-physical thing stored in a network I have no control over. Sounds familiar? Not sure what makes you think my analogy doesn't hold up. 
Also I was less specifically referring to criminal cases, but to the situation of multiple parties sharing *access*. The implications and consequences are the same as sharing keys. And people still refer to it as sharing their accounts, not access to them.
The keys are the accounts and the method of access at the same time. Nothing wrong, in my opinion, to refer to them one way or another. One being technically correct, the other being traditional and easy to wrap your head around for someone who has yet to understand the intricacies of that new model, assuming that's even necessary. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 12:51:20

In addition to what has been said already, don't delete the wallet.dat even if you don't remember the password. You might some day just wake up and remember it (the brain can be weird and this happens) or, if you're optimistic, who knows what will be possible in 10 years, and how much work people will be willing to put in a chance for 1.5btc.
Write down what you remember about your password, keep the wallet.dat.. won't hurt.

Just called my local branch. The guy on the phone, after trying to gather information about this, called me back, said he thinks it's for security reasons, but didn't seem to know anything about it.
Interestingly though, I asked about cryptocurrencies, and he brought up Bitcoin. So the topic isn't all too new at least.

Stop using the 144block figure. It's not significant.
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:46:38
Your comments hurt to read. Bitcoin is open, and that spurs competition. This is not a right or wrong scenario, let alone are you, nor anyone else, on the right side. 
It would be great if you could stop acting so entitled over something so completely baseless, and educate people with your superior knowledge instead of just spewing stupid fud like that. If you actually wanted to help Bitcoin be what it's meant to be as you keep claiming, you would have the smarts to realize it's the community, not the code, needing the most work right now. And that you're not helping with that the least bit. 
So maybe try to contribute a little to that, or just stay out of it and stop contributing to tearing the community in two. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:40:56
Which is a last resort, not what they want to be doing. The client forks including BU came to be because the core team was blocking an increase when it was most needed. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:09:03
Considering that we call the software to access our Bitcoin wallets, it's just natural that people will say they are "storing Bitcoin in a wallet". It just sounds right, and implying everyone who phrases it that way is stupid just seems.. stupid. 
I think it's safe to say that for some Bitcoiners this understanding is fundamental enough that it doesn't have to be emphasized with every sentence. While technically it seems very important, practically the difference is minor. Losing your keys is akin to losing your Bitcoin. Sharing your keys is akin to sharing your bank account, etc. etc. **The only major difference is in the transactions, which are made *using* keys, not *with* the keys, as in, they're not what's changing hands.** When it comes to safe storage, being nitpicky about this seems just out of place and bewildering to newcomers.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:31:57
Bitcoin Neo, maybe. As long as it brings something new to the table, why not? I don't get the hate against competition. That's why it's open and decentralized
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:24:44
So you want every potential Bitcoin user to know the intricacies of the protocol and technological options on how to advance the protocol? Good luck with that. 
We _need_ the community. We _need_ competent people to trust and represent, along with people, like core devs, that know the technology to a T. 
And we need opposition, like any good democracy. Instead of ridiculing them, calling them shills and accusing them of pushing some agenda, people should be working together, which is sadly a thing core has been failing at for a long time now, which is a big part of why Unlimited and consorts even exist. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:09:39
I very much hope that you are right.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:38:28
Because if they could be trusted with these matters we wouldn't be in this mess to begin with. Core was holding back a block size increase for the past two years. Of course noone is gonna trust them with this sort of thing again. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:19:03
You're not helping keeping the quality of _this_ sub up.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:59:32
Luke has been talking down to others for ages now. If that's what you think is how to protect a community, look what this got us all into. Well done. 
Also, I am not painting him as a villain. I am calling him out for being unable to express himself, and hurting the community with it. Sorry if that offends you, but I actually do care about Bitcoin and this stupid war is what is currently hurting it the most, and these accusations left and right are just fuelling the fire. 
Don't you get that this exact behaviour Luke is showing is why people move to alternatives? Core is behaving like shit and they are undermining their competence with it, which is no doubt there as you correctly say. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:57:49
Trust is a big part of how we operate and judge situations, no matter what the technological foundation is. 
And yeah, this sub including the core devs who have all this responsibility crying, insulting and stabbing at a different camp that has the same long term goal is just annoying and, yes, splitting the community in two. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 18:27:31
I assume he was talking about CAD, because we hit $1000 there during the $800 pump, hence my clarification I meant USD
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:39:05
Interesting. Yesterday I was playing around in Excel for a possible exit strategy (I know, I know), paying out X worth of dollars for every Y price increase in Bitcoin value... the one I liked most yielded a price of 485k/Btc at the time I finished paying out and thought to myself "Meh. That's never gonna happen."
Now that number is put into perspective.
@_date: 2016-06-29 03:54:25
Bought at $330 in preparation for the halving.
Already doubled in value, and it's not even here yet.

That's a really good idea! Would love to see it when it's finished :)
Thank you for the input. I've also checked out the market, and there are some really good ideas out there already.

This is amazing.
Does anyone have some ideas for what to do with this? I'd love to play around with that eventually. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:33:29
God I love the absurdity of this
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:59:12
Current price is 628 USD. I know we peaked at around 800 two weeks ago. Anything I am missing? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:07:02
Exactly what I meant, really. There's no reason to believe that the current price randomly happens to be an upper bound of some sort.
Sure, the price might drop again, so there is a *chance* there is a "better" time to buy where you can get more bang for your buck, but try timing that dip and you'll end up buying at $5000 instead of now.
To give a less fuddy answer, don't buy now, but *start* buying now. Put $100 or whatever you can afford into Bitcoin every month, no matter what the price is. That's how you invest instead of speculating.
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:36:35
Other way around today.. tried to buy at 920, but the order didn't go through because the price jumped so quickly after that. Took three attempts and got in at 945..
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:13:34
You are right of course.
When speculating, that's an important thing to keep in mind. When investing, you don't invest in the price as much as you invest in the fundamentals. The question is, which of the two OP is seeking to do.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:47:25
There is no such thing as 'too late'.

Not gonna argue on the rest, but for the record, what file a server returns on a specific URL is not absolute by any means. They could very easily serve you different files than to everyone else, same URLs and everything.
Just like your /feed/subscriptions on Youtube is individualized depending for the account logged in, any website could serve a different file on any heuristic available. Cookies, time, IP/Country of origin, using TOR / not using TOR, you name it.
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:20:30
Why the different block counts? 100/1000 vs 144/2048?
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:08:47
If that cheers you up, a lot of money was also made on shorting it
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:14:06
No. That doesn't even compare. Blocksize enables growth. Price reflects growth. Forgot I'm on the wrong sub.
@_date: 2016-12-11 16:54:43
That's why hashes are provided for downloads. If the hashes aren't made available centrally but via third party (GitHub, Pastebin, whatever) that is a surefire way to prevent this, with the exception that the downloaded file is an installer that also downloads files.
The bigger difference is that it's easier to do for an online wallet. Not saying I'm worried about this, but think: Bitcointalk gets hacked again. Last IP per account is leaked. If IP trying to access online wallet is that of a notorious whale in the forums, substitute JS delivered to client.
Unlike a fishy download, this could be happening on the fly with every access of the wallet, which is more potent.
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:39:16
That's why there's a backlog. Because there isn't
@_date: 2016-12-13 13:41:02
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:41:02
That refers to transaction costs, not to price. Technically you can still send a few cents to someone else, but economically you can't because of the transaction fees. Which would be solved if blocks weren't constantly full, with a constant backlog of transactions.
I couldn't care less about Ethereum, but holy mother of God do we need blocks with a size that is controlled by demand and supply the same way the price is. The artificial limit is pissing me off to no end.

Because of traction. Many people dislike Facebook, but stick with it because "choosing" to abandon Facebook means "choosing" to leave a lot of people behind.
Bitcoin works similarly. I don't choose to stick with a centralized solution to a problem that shouldn't even exist, but I'm still stuck with it because forking means I can no longer use any service that supports Bitcoin. It's worse for the businesses themselves, because switching to a fork would mean losing their whole userbase, with the exception of the few who join them.
You make these claims, and sure it sounds easy enough, but that's not how it works. Traction, and the network effect, are a huge issue.

Gambling is a way to entertain yourself, no more or less than any other means of entertainment you shell out money for.
If you play with money you can't afford to lose you're as much of a sob as an alcoholic, but that's really not the best measure if you're trying to fire shots at someone who is being unbiased, doesn't cry about his loss and is just generally trying to help people.
And yes, there are dodgy sites out there in an unregulated market. Surprise! Pointing those out is a good thing, allowing others to make more informed decisions.

While this is becoming more commonplace, you would be surprised how many sites that have region dependent settings aside of the language just used that to also set the language at some point.
The best example I have is gog.com. I have been using the site for years. In English, being a satisfied customer. When they started localizing, the language of the newsletter I received suddenly changed to German.
If I had wanted to get the newsletter in English again, according to the customer support, I would have had to unsubscribe, change my location to an English speaking country, subscribe to the newsletter again and then change my location back.
Not related to browser settings, but the problem is the same. Location is being misused for language detection.

Well, about 9 years ago I bought my first external hard drive. 300gb for 400 bucks. A 10tb drive is now 350 dollars. You go figure.
My guess is that 10 years from now, 10tb will be fine. Still not data center mode.
On top of that, if this sub has any respect left for the words of Satoshi, there's no problem with the average user running a light wallet.  
I sure as hell won't be running a full node on my phone whether the blockchain is 10gb or 10tb and the phone is arguably the most practical device for day to day wallets for most users, including myself. So per definition most wallets will be light nodes, and the few of us running full nodes will be able to do so 10 years from now, too.

Yes. Good luck finishing a sync on that $50 drive. You don't even have to project into the future for that. $50 hardware doesn't cut it presently, and $50 hardware won't cut it 5 years down the road, or 10. The bar stays the same, and, much like smartphones did with the world of microsensors, if crypto becomes as mainstream as people here wish and claim it will, and full nodes are a part of that, which they likely won't be, the market will follow.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:10:04
I do agree and my argument wasn't in opposition to that.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:07:43
Definitely true. I think that is more of a political problem than a technolocial one, though. Not to be underestimated of course, that just means there's no technical solution to it, either.
While this is a big problem, I am of the opinion that if you're so limited by your ISP that you can't run a full node, that is not your biggest loss of freedom caused by that situation. And if you can't pay for the bandwidth, you probably don't need a full node to secure your funds, either.
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:14:38
I have to agree. Got his book sitting on my shelf and have been subscribed to his newsletter for quite a while.
It really is sad because there is no need for him to do it. He's well set. He's sort of respected. According to the book and probably his other writing, he's on good terms with himself.
Yet, he has to try and sell people stuff or otherwise profit off of them. I don't get it.

He said let the market decide. No mention of hashrate being the market. Your argument is made from thin air.
Also, there likely won't be swings between the chains, because without replay protection there won't be two chains to swing between for too long.
The market in that case is not the hashrate, but the people deciding which chain they will be using/protecting their coins on. I don't see how that is not reasonable.

How is 300gb data center mode? A 500gb hdd is 50 bucks. Hell, a 256gb thumb drive is 80 bucks.
Edit: Also, Star Citizen is expected to be 100gb in size. Which is a game. That people play on their computers, at home. Other games are a couple 10s of gb as well. Those are for entertainment. If software with a use case is 5 to 10 times that size, it's bulky, sure, but nowhere near "data center mode"
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:22:36
*You* are missing the point. The center of this was the initial sync time, not the running cost after catching up. Which is at time X a certain size Y, for both a game, and the blockchain.
All I was saying is that if that magnitude is acceptable for a game, it's also acceptable for the blockchain. Is it optimal? No. But given the huge benefits it brings, it's absolutely justifiable. As is, under circumstances, the tradeoff between actually using a light wallet and not going through that hassle.
Everything in this sub keeps getting skewed. It's pointless to try and raise a point, or have a discussion.

It's not about the protocol. It's about its implementation. If a signed message larger than, for example, 1kb caused a buffer overflow in one of the clients and the last characters would get written into an address space that gets interpreted later on you could potentially do all kinds of nefarious things.

What you're saying is entirely true, if it wasn't Kim ~~Schmitz~~ Dotcom we're talking about.
He has sold out his users everytime it saved his ass or made him extra money. He's a leech and everything he does is usually to enrich himself, no matter if others are hurt in the process. His  to me, is no more than a publicity stunt by an egocentric business man.
Even if he does get involved, and that's the point of my original comment, he's the kind of guy I can imagine actually hurting Bitcoin in the long term. So unless his  is resistant to his own malicious personality, I can't see myself cheering for this. 
But the article is exclusively speculation based on some tweets, that doesn't really belong on to begin with, imho.

Keep putting away a little each month. Keep those coins secure.
Also keep it to a small(ish) percentage of your whole portfolio. If things turn out as well as everyone here is pretty much hoping for, that will be more than enough while you're still on the safe side with the remaining, bigger chunk of your savings. If it turns south, it might sting, but you won't be in deep trouble.
Maybe consider it more of a hedge against the remainder of your portfolio/savings, not an investment in on itself.

Well in their terms, their laverage comes closer to "whatever the fuck we feel like". They have a history of changing their instruments with no announcements whatsoever. During the last bubble I watched their BTC CFD drop from 1:10 leverage to 1:1, with at least 5 changes inbetween.
I actually wouldn't recommend anyone to use them. I just felt like throwing $100 at something with leverage to add a little intensity to the rollercoaster and p500 was the fastest way to do that, because I'm already stuck with them.

I have this funny little theory. People were saying that there won't be another bubble, because "everyone expects it" and it would be priced in, etc etc.
What I'm thinking is that the current market situation will leave people losing hope, forgetting about the whole bubble thing, and by the time the price actually breaks out, even if it takes until the next block halving, nobody will be expecting a a steep rise anymore and then history will actually repeat one more time.

It's mostly a habit, I guess, but it generally sounds quite appealing to me.
Some sites are actually pretty functional hotwallets. Keeping small amounts there and paying out of the sites internal hotwallet instead of your own wallet sounds appealing to me, especially in this context, with companies tracking payments.
I am also playing on these sites, so I usually know the owners and keep track of the site and its technical aspects more actively than I would with a mixing service.
Not that I would recommend this to anyone, but it works for me.

If address A has 10,000 stolen Bitcoins, and sends 50 BTC to address B, which then tries to deposit into an exchange, you can't tell if address B is owned by the thief who owns address A, or someone who unknowingly accepted them as payment.
You are not meant to be able to tell the difference. You are not meant to get your BTC stolen to begin with. Fighting the root of the problem is a better approach, and the way the protocol works encourages us to do just that instead of exchanges blindly blocking transactions of whatever address they see fit.

Which is still no physical thing. So yeah, they are quite the same, which was my point in the first place. If the USD can be a global currency, so can Bitcoin.
Of course the USD is backed by it's current scope of application as the fundament of anything finance-related on a global scale, leading to an enormous market cap and thus reliable stability, which again leads to the "money goes to money" thing.
The trust lies in it's reliability, but now that news pop up that show the FED is, indeed, not as reliable as it "seemed" to be, I think it's a good time for people to consider alternatives.

The website went down due to traffic, it seems. I've been there 20 minutes ago, it was slow as F* and any offer below €700 was bought out as soon as it popped up. And I'm pissed I didn't get in on the fun.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:45:30
I just checked and have a little over 100BTC in there. I'd donate some of that to Seans Outpost if it went through.

~~Be back~~ get well soon. Please.

You're missing something on that fancy page. It needs a banana for scale.

I really don't understand much of the inner workings of Bitcoin, yet, but Satoshi seems to be a bunch of steps ahead of everyone else on this planet.
Bitcoin is well engineered and prepared for so many things that are just coming into focus right now, years after it came out.
Satoshi seems to be prepared just as well and that's pretty amazing.

Can we call it the Million Dollar Fraud already or do we have to wait?
@_date: 2013-06-03 10:02:40
I'd totally steal their logo. Heh.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:10:51
Heya. I just signed up as well. The front page keeps showing the "Sign up" screen. Gonna wait for a nice job to be posted, I guess. :)
Good luck with the site!
@_date: 2013-06-21 10:36:50
Still love your site! Been somewhat idle, but I'm at over 8k spins.
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:51:33
But this time it's different!
@_date: 2013-08-28 16:11:45
Apols? Do people really use that? I haven't even read this on facebook.
@_date: 2013-10-20 15:39:32
Well if it takes until the end of the year for this exponential network growth to top out, this could be wrong. I doubt that will happen, though.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:19:11
Unlikely in my opinion. We haven't gone below the peak of a previous bubble before, so that would leave us with a minimum of $266, more likely around $400 to $500 though.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:19:29
I can only give one upvote anyways, so it doesn't really matter. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:30:10
Well if you wanna buy as fast as possible, your best bet is propably [localbitcoins](
Unless you have a special account at your bank, you most likely couldn't turn that much money into *any* other currency without telling them a day or two beforehand. So if you plan to buy, prepare, so you're ready when you decide *now* is the moment.

Are you located in the EU?
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:15:23
PM me if you decide to buy, so I can cash out first.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:41:43
Assuming this was a thing. As a site-owner, how would you prove yourself? Is there actually a way besides "Guys, I'm fo reals."
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:59:20

It currently sits at 2k profit.

Have one child, get two back 30 years later?
@_date: 2013-08-30 13:52:08
It's completely different!
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:49:43
Of course. We could just skip the currency part completely if it wasnt linked to anything.
I don't have a solution, I'm just saying there is room for improvement to some degree.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:21:59
Why would you buy them? You don't buy your Dollars either, do you?
@_date: 2013-06-16 12:18:18
Does my upvote increase the chance for this to become reality? I sure hope so.
@_date: 2013-12-29 11:16:14
Never been to a festival. I want to go there.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:54:00
For now, I wouldn't do anything. I don't know if technology could solve the problems, but I don't see a solution.
Assuming Bitcoin takes over and becomes the number one currency, I see one problem coming up, which is the limit of 21M bitcoins combined with the growing chance of coins getting lost in dead wallets.
Just look at that guy earlier who lost 3BTC because he forgot his password. I lost some 0.2BTC on blockchain because I started up a wallet and never used it again. There might be hundreds of coins lost even before Bitcoins are taking off. Imagine people getting older and eventually dying. How many of them would take their BTC to the grave?
Many, I guess.
Right now, I don't see any other solution to that but to either have a regulating force, as with normal bank accounts, that can get the money back into the system where needed, or to renew the whole currency once in a (very long) while.
EDIT: I don't think deflation is a good solution. It might be a solution, but this post is about what could be done in a better way.
Also, if a bread doesn't cost the same in the same currency, 50 years apart, we haven't improved that much.
@_date: 2013-06-22 09:30:10
how about editing it?
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:53:10
How dare you to imply that not all internet strangers have bad intentions. Doh.
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:25:56
Wouldn't that be *the* opportunity for bitcoinstore to push towards their goal?
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:29:30
I know it's a different value with bitcointip.. but I think Flip is awesome.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:19:42
Those $100 this imaginary money is worth right now must be imaginary as well.

They'll save them for the next government shutdown.

@_date: 2013-04-24 17:01:39
Not sure if I should upvote for reading my mind or downvote for supporting my lazyness. Then again, you propably earned it for both.
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:47:38
Edit: Fixed something. Hope it turned out better.
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:53:38
Your ability to take part in it's generation should not be linked to your current wealth, like it's just happening for BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:00:37
The dropdown is kinda broken for me. FFv25, Win7.
The mouseleave event seems to fire when moving from the link to the dropdown.

300 many, many users.

Are there any statements how gambling laws apply to bitcoins? It's pretty much impossible to get a license to legally provide gambling games/services in Germany.
@_date: 2013-09-14 18:24:50
Do we have any miners here that have made more from their investment into a miner than if they had bought btc at the time?
