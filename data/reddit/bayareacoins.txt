Where is it then? Because that is the address they list and I talked to the people at the Packaging Center.  California just released a consumer warning on Coinbase as well. I lost a huge sum of money being led to believe that the State of California ok'ed them and blah blah blah. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:49:44
In the process of trying to pursue Coinbase in court for their "regulated" exchange Pump and Dump... honestly I'd rather take a shot at suing OKcoin.
OKcoin is the most comfortable exchange with leverage trading and futures.  Their security feels good, their withdraws are fast and their support is 24/7 with great english.
Just because a exchange is in California doesn't mean they are trust worthy.  I happen to think people at Coinbase are the biggest pieces of shit in the game and they are just a few blocks away from me in their hidden office at One Front Street.

The security error that I found was on Blockchain's exchange "The Pit".  Not Blockchain's wallet or their blockchain explorer.  Even my website used Blockchain's explorer... we are changing that today or tomorrow (it's not a security risk).  I will let you know which option we go with.  Probably going to use Blockstreams explorer until we make our own Bitcoin one.   [

Coinbase is trash too, back in 2015 they claimed they got their regulation licenses, pumped Bitcoin maliciously while they put a rocket count down timer with a link to a 10 hour "rickrolled" video that was supposed to be reported for "porn" so that youtube staff had to watch the whole thing in their source code of the rocket timer.  When the timer hit zero, they purposely announced they were "regulated", then "they" dumped!  After a few days the California government stepped in.  [
Fuck Coinbase too.

Cheers to "military-grade" security from Blockchain's new exchange "The Pit" for Bitcoins 18 million minting:   [
@_date: 2019-10-19 09:38:12
Then I'd be putting some poor innocent user that thinks they are using "military-grade" security at risk of getting physically robbed.
Let's say the user just wants to make some trades at a coffee shop and they don't want to withdraw, so they leave their 2fa at home on purpose to prevent someone from stealing both their computer and their 2fa at once (assuming The Pit askes for 2fa on withdraws for accounts with 2fa set lol)... the user would get a rude awakening without my bug report.
This website allows $100,000 fiat withdraws and $200,000 crypto withdraws weekly with a selfy and your ID.  If you provide a little bit more than that... you can withdraw $5,000,000 of both fiat and crypto per week (see [here](  Can you IMAGINE trusting your account was protected by 2fa and having someone turn off your 2fa while you're 2fa is in your safe at home?  Bye $10,000,000 because The Pit's 2fa backup wasn't secure.

He is going to steal those Bitcoins I'm sure of it.

No.  Poloniex is getting their licenses stripped because dumb ass Tristian (previous owner of polo) claimed they were an MSB in 2015, but the company didn't start applying until 2018.

Thanks for your response.  It's super nice to get input from people that are actually in the security industry.
My major problem with all of this is that HackerOne staff told me that the feature [functioned as expected]( Blockchain fixed this issue, and then Blockchain staff told me that they actually [knew about the bug prior]( to me reporting it.  If Blockchain's "The Pit" ([military-grade security]( actually knew about this security flaw but neglected it fix it... that's even worse than thinking the feature was working as intended! Holy shit!
I was basing my definition of a "critical issue" from Blockchain's HackerOne page (img [here](  " **Critical** (compromise of important infrastructure; vulnerabilities that result in theft of cryptographic key material or user funds e.g. Wallet XSS, server Command Injection): $2,000+ "
I believe I meet their definition due to compromising important infrastructure and the bug would result in the loss of user funds.
With this error.  I could easily sit at your computer for 30 seconds without having access to your 2fa and remove your 2fa security, compromise your account, lock you out &amp; begin to steal your funds via BTC withdraw at the tune of a few hundred thousand dollars a day (or even $10,000,000 per week if the account is "[Platinum verified](
Thanks for that link, I'll read it first thing in the morning because I'm hella tired atm.  I will likely reply tomorrow as well &lt;3.

Right, Bitcoin isn't the problem that these State regulators are having with Poloniex.  Bitcoins cool. People like Bitcoin at all levels and walks of life.  The problem is Poloniex and other bad actors that use Bitcoin.  Trying to represent shitcoins as "stablecoins" or anything in between that trick or cause investors into thinking they are pegged against USD or is convertible to USD is fucking wild too or preventing people from accessing their funds.  Bitcoin doesn't do that.

The weekend after Coinbase got over $100 million dollars from their VC's and the NYSE twitted about helping Coinbase bring transparency to Bitcoin... What did they do?  Used this news to run a pump and dump off fake news that the state of California was forced to issue a warning in regards to about.  They "rick rolled" us good.  They had the Rickroll video hidden in their "lunar launch page" or as Charlie teased on Facebook "the lunar landing." (cause the market crashed... har har very funny)

Ah I understand.
I wish we could retrieve your Clamcoins by only signing a message or something simple... but we can't.  Think of it as a paper wallet and in order to sweep the funds, you need the privates.
Checking for CLAMs requires no private information.  If you use just the first part of my site it only requires the public key to see if the address does contain CLAMs.  
I think maybe you mean the Github?

You should absolutely empty and retire your address regardless of how you choose to dig your Clamcoins.
Even though I'm telling you we don't save private keys... it wouldn't be very "crypto" of you to believe me.  Please please please practice good security and only use empties.
The problem is if I was a bad character.... you give me your private key.... you send a Bitcoin to your address a year later.... I still have the keys to steal your coins.... We don't want to allow anyone to put you in that spot.  That is why we strongly urge people to practice good security and help your friends do the same.
