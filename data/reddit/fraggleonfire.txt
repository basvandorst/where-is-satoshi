No I didn’t, I mean if he wanted to get in and pay $4,000 more expensive than it is now that’s a great opportunity, greatttt buy. I felt it would go down further and get a better price based on the downward trend it has been on since the $19,800. It was just my opinion, he didn’t have to listen. So far looks like I was right....pal

I’m holding my tongue with a friend too. I went through four years of college and graduated with an economics/finance degree. He got his degree in computer tech. He’s been PRAISING crypto and jones so much about it. He can say with CERTAINTY it’ll be a buy. Told me Litecoin was an amazing buy at $306. It’s now at $198 just a few weeks later. Had to tell me how good his portfolio was doing and wouldn’t answer any of my rational questions about long term plan, risk level, or anything close to responsible investing.
Pssst a lil secret. 98% of these guys know nothing about market psychology and investment

“Most people who have heard the term think that the “blockchain” is only something to do with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, litecoin, doguecoin and others. It’s the technology that underpins digital currencies and ensures that all transactions are properly conducted and recorded. But what is stored on the blockchain need not be just a currency unit – it can be put to all manner of other interesting uses.”
NEED NOT BE JUST A CURRENCY UNIT. 
It can be used for tracking produce, toys, your moms buttplug, anything as long as the system in place to be decentralized, P2P to follow the chain of supply and distribution.

So based on your “projection” where do you think it’s going to be at in 5 months and I’d love to see your technical analysis on it lol

The problem I think is all these Bitcoin jihadists have massive egos attached to their stance that it’ll explode so they can look like investing gods and can look down on the peasants and say “I bought bitcoin before alllll of you when it was just X$, look how smart I am....PRAISEEE ME!!”

Yea anytime anyone says “I guarantee” or “I know” or “it WILL...” they have no business advising investments. There are so many unforeseen variables that could drop any financial instrument on its ass at anytime. Nothing is certain, everything is theory. Be humble fuckers

Dude, blockchain is a series of transaction stamps. A system that can be used on many different things other than bitcoin

Yea and why can’t you use that P2P system also with buyers of a good from America and sellers from another country. You can track a supply line of transactions of fruit instantly using a blockchain from you all the way back through every exchange of hand back to the source to quickly find diseases for an example.

It would just be wise to see if it can pull up in the next day or two because it’s breaking a lot of upward trend lines atm. First time this has happened since before October 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:13:06
And with bigger market and global interest/influence there is more possible variables from power plays and news scares like South Korea making it illegal. Or if big boys get into play they can easily manipulate media to pull pump n dumps

I think it will honestly, I don’t have any money in the game. I’m just an investment enthusiast. I’m enjoying the entertainment lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:32:33
Completely agree! I just listened to the Joe Rogan podcast with the FCC commissioner who voted for net neutrality and she said she’s unsure on Bitcoin.....but she thinks blockchain will be an amazing thing for the entire economy and all forms of market and goods transactions   
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:57:41
See if bulls can get back in control the next few days for momentum. The trend line up since November has been breached, RSI just below 50.00 could mean more room for selloff, price action below 50MA and 10ma just broke south of 50MA. If bit lovers don’t defend at $11,008 which is 61.8% Fibonacci retracement  then I think it could tumble to $8,300 which is long term trend line. Next few days will be key.

There are very predictive patterns within TA that can lead to a rational theory about the next possible move. Predictive theory is a probabilities game 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:40:48
Not gambling, many intraday traders make money following TA nods in conjunction with press releases to anticipate a surge in a certain direction. You don’t go in blindly. You anticipate, and once you get confirmation you bite
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:24:56
If you really understood RSI you would see that every time it breached into overbought zones that there was a subsequent dip back below 70 on the RSI, a mini correction. Every time over the last few weeks. I back checked data to see if there was a pattern and there was. Maybe you should do the same next time before assuming
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:24:24
Your best bet is to have your risk/reward ratio decided before entering. Set a predetermined stop loss and a goal of ROI. Once you hit that, start tiering profit gains a few percentage as a time and continue to move that stop loss up. Takes some of the emotion out of it when you have a system in place before hand
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:49:33
Forex day trader here.  To go with this strategy you need a solid grasp of chart and technical analysis to know when the indicators are pointing in a direction. It’s not foolproof. You have to be patient and only trade when all signs point to a rally, reversal of a moderate size move. I’ve been following BTC from a technical standpoint standpoint the past week and have only seen two trading opportunities. Last Saturday and short, trail with stop when we say the dive to 13,000$. And the second one yesterday I said it looks like a reversal is about to happen and buy. A 4000$ swing. So you could intraday, but with any confidence you may only make 2-4 trades a week. At least I would.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:20:13
For now lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:33:10
A few encouraging technical points i saw from the hourly chart just now. Really pulling away from the 50MA which usually means a correction in the opposite direction is incoming and the RSI has been grinding on the underside of 40 which is saying OVERSOLD. Just trying to add a few little marshmallows of positivity for your morning guys : ). Hang in there!
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:11:16
Think you misspelled Market psychology ; ). 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:51:30
What kind of investing, technical analysis and risk management knowledge did he have? To lose that much so quick he clearly doesn’t sound like he knew how to manage risk
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:38:01
That’s a possibility, but that pump still means the RSI was right in citing a move up was incoming. Either way you were wrong, I just went back and double checked. 4 times since the 13th RSI called overbought and an immediate dip happened. Albeit the overall trend was bullish the short term trend favors what the RSI says.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:29:03
You personally have shorted on the down swing? I know a lot of people who are just buying and holding long term instead of intra day trading 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:40:00
Is anyone playing both directions intraday? Playing swings up and down. I don’t have any money in the game but did an analysis last Saturday at 19,800 ish that I see a potential swing down and potential shorting opportunity if that high wasn’t exceeded with the next swing up. Now 30% down since and it would have been a good call. 
Just curious if anyone is playing this both ways. Looking to short and go long depending on their technical analysis. I don’t have the blood for it but I think you could make some good money if these multi thousand dollar value swings become a Rythem for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:01:27
Absolutely, it’ll bounce back up soon enough once these big guys stop shorting and spread out the wealth amongst many smaller investors who actually value it
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:59:01
I was with one Forex trading firm and for EVERY trade we had to fill out a game plan form with pricing risk ratios, our goal price to exit. Made me much more accountable and consistent 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:33:26
A lot of it also has to do with market psychology. I only trade off technical analysis, mostly in forex. I did a review of the BTC chart last Saturday and you were seeing smaller choppier moves from a base to a spike from the previous few days of long bases and steeper spikes. It’s a sign of market indecision when and the bears catching up with the bulls. 
That in conjunction with big approaching round numbers like 20,000 make people nervous, unsure if it will break that resistance. Once I saw that a previous high candle of 19,800 ish wasn’t met with a higher candle on the Next swing I felt a downturn was coming. It means the bears have over powered the bulls. 
At that point many people smarter than me and more money in it are already seeing this bear swing down and SELL OFF. It had surged so much at that point they want to gather profits. And re buy once it dips. 
You have to understand many people aren’t in this for the long term but as intra day moves. Quick money and volumes of moves based off swings up and down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:29:10
That’s why at my firm we only trade based off TA 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:14:33
Indicators shouldn’t be used as end all be all to buy/sell but more as confirmation of preexisting analysis. You want to gather as many variables as possible that point a value going in a certain direction.

It’s is mainstream, it’s been featured in many national corporate commercials with added bitcoin support along with everyone talking about it. The big boys got involved and you guys are seeing two big pump and dumps. First one from $19,800 down to $11,900. And second from $14,800 to now below $7,000.
The big financial firms now control it. The tech nerds who have been “hodling”(which is a faggy phrase imo) for years no longer are in control. 
Now with many countries banning its utility I don’t see it going above $12-$13,000 ever again.
It might spread in use and utility and continue its mainstream presence but utility expansion doesn’t mean value expansion.
