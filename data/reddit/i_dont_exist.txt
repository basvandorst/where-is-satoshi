It's called typosquatting a form of cybersquatting. It's trademark infringement and they can sue for damages.

MTGox is trademarked. 
Honestly a wallpaper website is probably operating off of ad revenue and probably isn't making enough money to really care about typosquatting - even if they are bringing in 6 figure traffic. If it was an actual product or brand they were trying to protect things would be different.

It's TM infringement if you are forwarding it to a competing website. If you were just sitting on the domains and collecting ad revenue it would be a different story, but since you are clearly causing consumer confusion it is without a doubt TM infringement. You might be a niche industry where ppl don't care or have the funds to fight it, jump in a larger industry and I can guarantee you will get a C&amp;D the second they find out.

There is a clear distinction between owning a misspelled website and linking that misspelled website to a competitors website. You better believe if ebbay.com was linked over to a competitors auction site there would have been a lawsuit in minutes.

I guess i can understand both sides of the argument. Using your logic tho any development from the original bitcoin (years ago) is a fake version. I don’t think BCash guys are purposely trying to mislead but instead they honestly believe their development is more aligned with the original.

Hmm is it a fake version tho? I thought it was just a bitcoin fork that went with larger blocks instead of lightning network?
