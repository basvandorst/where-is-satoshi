I mean, it's possible but I would think the noobs are the minority of BTC holders in China. The vast majority of BTC transactions worldwide go through China. I would expect them to know what they're doing.

How would they benefit from selling? Prices aren't exactly at an all-time high though they're getting there.

Define "normal". Do you mean pre-shutdown?

You make a good point, regardless. Maybe the noobs and the OG's will balance each other out. Doubt it, but.... I could be totally wrong. I'm just guessing here like everyone else. Hopefully, someone with plenty of knowledge on the topic comes and puts me in my place real quick ��

I didn't really think about that. That link is more directed toward the exchanges and how they should proceed with the shutdown. I honestly don't know though; do BTC exchanges hold all of the BTC that they distribute out? Does that mean they have to sell off mass amounts of BTC thus lowering BTC prices drastically? I have no idea how that works.

You have a good point. The involved investors more than likely know better than the rest of the world what's going on with the crypto regs in their country and would be ahead of the game when it comes to protecting their investments. However, idk if "ridiculous" is the right word. There are probably quite a few people (the average investors who hopped on the BTC bandwagon because it sounded like an okay way to make some side money) who are either unaware or uneducated on the BTC exchange closures in China.

So wouldn't they buy into the dip?

The Chinese are slowly waking up and the BTC prices are rising alongside them as they realize that their favorite BTC exchanges are going away. My prediction, along with many others, is that they're going to buy all they can, while it's easy to do so. Once the exchanges are gone, the simplicity is gone (though VPN is the obvious resolution). I sincerely hope they buy more than they can afford.*
**Spoken from a dude who's missed every single surge but caught this one on at the exact minute it hit $2,800 :)))
A discussion is strongly encouraged following this post. I'm sincerely curious as to why the Chinese would sell their BTC holdings as many people are convinced they will. What would be the benefit? Why wouldn't they just hold on to their fortunes and trade through VPN via any of the international exchanges?

What's the most profitable altcoin to mine right now?

Unintentionally. Tried to reply to the other dude
