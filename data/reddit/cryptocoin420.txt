There is already another one and it's been out long before Silk Road was shut down.  It was the one for the Litecoin market called ATLANTIS.  Yeah I guess with your logic all the drug dealers on the street that get locked up, nobody will follow in their steps.....right...
Edit:  guess it has been shut doe since 2013.

Too bad he didn’t inhale.  Joe should have called him on that shit!
