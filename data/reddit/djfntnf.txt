I really think if a company isn’t going to let the coins off it shouldn’t accept them. You’re right people should control their own keys. Also a US company should not set up a roach motel for crypto currency in a poor country.

Free speech means free speech for speech you don’t like. You’ve seen infowars in the media but I doubt you’ve ever listened to it. It doesn’t really promote hate it promotes Trump. I don’t support trump but I also think deplatforming political opponents based on lies is a bad precedent. You might not be a piece of shit but you’re certainly naive and ideas like yours are terrible for the country.
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:46:42
Just so you understand, free speech isn’t something we value because it’s in the constitution. It’s something that was put in the constitution because founders valued it. A country can oppose free speech like China. A company like twitter can nominally support it as a value. PayPal is violating the principle of free speech by refusing customers based on political speech very similar to how Wikileaks free speech was violated by Visa and MasterCard. It’s not a constitutional issue it’s an ethical principle issue. 
I doubt you’ve listened to infowars. It’s not anti immigrant. It’s anti big government and anti war, many bitcoiners used to be. You think anyone who isn’t a leftist is stupid and you want to create a world where half the country won’t do business with the other. Silly emotional nonsense poorly thought out on your part.
@_date: 2018-10-07 13:33:44
There you go. You want to shut down half the country. That works both ways genius. Amazing how people throw their brains out the window when it comes to politics. That applies to you pal not just the Donald.

Honestly anyone can get rid of them very easily and I assume that is known. The problem I see is bitcoin isn’t currently set up to scale for its use in every store you walk into. It needs more innovation like lightning etc. before it’s ready.

Weird thing is, I thought the retail side of their business WAS there business. This is like Google selling the internet search side of their business to focus completely on project loon.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:31:11
Pretty recently and probably currently I’d see it as a payment option for big ticket items like cars gold etc. this use case makes sense because they give you a discount due to the high credit card fees. If things scaled really well with something like lightning and you were paid in bitcoin and tax laws were clarified it might make sense for everyday purchases.

My guess would be that more people pile in during “bubbles” and some stick around and some don’t. And I would guess that more people get in steadily over time. But I think the distribution probably increased when it was running up with some people who had been in “cashing out” and so many people signing up the sites were overloaded and blocks full.  Probably not so much now.

Didn’t that horrible guy have an Instagram account too? I think I read a study that 2% of Twitter and 4% of Gab is hate speech. I’ve gone to gab and I haven’t seen much offensive content. I wouldn’t seek it either. The beautiful thing about Twitter Gab etc is you are in total control of who you follow.
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:38:44
If Twitter only banned actual nazis I wouldn’t expect Gab to succeed. But Twitter bans a lot of people that aren’t even close to being Nazis. And Twitter seems to be getting more aggressive. The more of the mainstream they ban the faster gab will take over. Ultimately, even people who commit heinous felonies and serve their time are allowed to speak. The MSM also interviews horrible people like Charles Manson etc., essentially amplifying their voice. so if Twitter gives up being the public square Gab or something like it will take over.

Are you sure you’re thinking of the right guy when you call him a nazi?

Some games are zero sum. Some are positive sum, like the stock market. You must think bitcoin will eventually go back to 0? You’re in the wrong subreddit if so.

The trustee wouldn’t zero it out I think, like the mtgox trustee he has to try to protect creditors by maximizing assets of liquidated assets, not legal advice just a thought.

What are the best historical examples of capitalism failing? The closest natural experiments were North and South Korea, East and West Germany, Hong Kong and China. In all those historical examples capitalism did better than centrally controlled economies. Importantly we have very similar starting conditions of very similar populations. Those are my examples. What are your best examples?
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:21:55
I certainly don’t agree that N Korea or the USSR had good economies but I agree that “isms” aren’t helpful if they make things less rather than more clear.
I like the index of economic freedom because it at least tries to objectively rank countries in economic freedom. It probably doesn’t match people’s expectations. Canada with universal care ranks higher than the U.S.
I consider it very problematic to consider Germany UK Canada and Venezuela the “socialist countries” and the United States, and the Roman Empire the “capitalist” countries. Besides the obvious problem of judging the economy of an empire that started around 70AD and lasted well over 1000 years, labeling some of the freest economies “socialist” allows people to misattribute what makes them desirable places to live in. While the US spends more on military than for example Germany it also spends tremendously on Medicare and Medicaid and is far more similar to Germany than either is to Venezuela.

Did you used to argue with r buttcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:09:42
Would you agree that throughout history the more control the government has over the economy the worse the result? Or do you think if you had an absolute saint with total power over the economy you would get a good result?
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:29:47
Can you explain why you think the dark ages was a capitalistic system? Based on my knowledge it was feudalistic in which 90+% of the population were farmers, effectively slave like serfs tied to the land. I’m not sure how informative that is to how ineffective or effective capitalism is.
When I referenced China and Hong Kong. They used to be separate economic systems and Hong Kong thrived with a free economy while China suffered under communism. China needed walls to keep their people from fleeing to Hong Kong. Nowadays China has adopted capitalism and therefore lifted many people out of poverty.
Can you think of any specific country where you believe capitalism has failed?

How is it certain he knew something was wrong? He’s not a medical scientist. I’d give him the benefit of the doubt that he believed her as most people did until shown otherwise. I meant He is a victim because he lost money and reputation unless he actually knew something was wrong. Can you concisely explain why you think he knew something was wrong without needing to watch a video? Because you wrote a lot there and all of it would be consistent with someone who just believed a smart well credentialed family friend in a field not his own and someone used to being an iconoclast and dealing with skepticism. Are there other examples of shady behavior from him or just this one?

Why do you assume he’s shady? If he invested in Theranos Id assume he was a victim and surely he lost money on it. You may be right but I think people are too quick to call other people shady. He invested probably was tricked and only him and accredited investors lost there right?

What you are discussing has nothing to do with what makes Germany 25 and Venezuela 179 on that ranking. It’s a big problem to say Germany is socialist... Venezuela is socialist.... what’s the difference? You need to acknowledge the very substantial differences between the two or people will be mislead into thinking ridding themselves of Maduro will solve all their problems. Germany and Venezuela are extremely different economic systems.
