I put in 1.1k right before the paypal news hit. So many people missed the original boat but I'm in it for the long-run.

What hasn't been compromised?

Ahhh, makes sense. I was about to sell some when the paypal news "stabalized" because I kind of know that people jump on and sell a day later. Overall I think this investment will be something that I check less and less over the next few months until I hear something crazy on the news.

So your "so happy" you found your dead husbands bitcoin wallet and now just want to turn it into cash to pay debt "he" left behind... It's not "our" debt, its just his? Maybe i'm just a dick, I don't know.

Could you recommend the "right way" of not over-encrypting and keeping your bitcoins secure? I was thinking of putting the files into a truecrypt file, uploading to the cloud and writing the password in a few places. That way I have it on several servers around the world and a copy on my PC also. As for the password, something like a VIN number of a car.

Yeah I meant a copy of the wallet, not the actual password. My password would be my cars VIN but half of the characters would be typed with "shift" held down or something along those lines. Even if my password was a "track 2" swipe of one of my credit cards that would work. 
A question for you, has there been any estimates of how many bitcoins have just been "lost" because of death/fire/over-encryption/etc ? If a study comes out that shows a big portion are, that could affect the price significantly I assume. For example, I know when I used to buy bitcoins at $1-5 a piece I had a few left over and some that I mined somewhere - they are just lost or leftovers because nobody was battling for cents at that time.

How did your day trading do?  I have a ton of free time during work to watch it and have an understanding about trading, trends, etc.

Do you think there will come a point where we will be able to trust a websites security enough to just leave them there? I mean when banks get hacked, my money is still there no matter how many credit card numbers are stolen.
