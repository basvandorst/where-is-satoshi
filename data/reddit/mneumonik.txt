I'll draw examples that are not "my rig" specific shortly, probably tomorrow. Basically though, if you want to have a crack at it without examples, I use powershell with a .Net object of System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient as a streamwriter to write a line of path/value/epoch to carbon. 
It shouldn't be that difficult tbh. Sometimes its better to learn without copypasta ;)

At the moment, NiceHash.  These graphs mostly come from data their API provides.

Heh you said small unit

not going to lie, i have no idea what i'm doing with mining. I just know servers and monitoring really well :)
Buy a lot of GPU's and hopefully profit some day? That's what i'm hoping for!

We have a tiered plan, for the first 500kwh  it’s 22cents/kWh and above that 40cents/kWh if I remember correctly. There’s also a time of day variable that’s cheaper past midnight to 6am.
Seems they make it really hard to calculate, probably to pay you less against generating for them :)
Yeah I’ve been all about sustainability these days, moved to CA 5 years ago and going full crunchy granola hahaha

Yeah I average 1.7MWh per month, this year just had 2 months of issues where it stopped producing randomly and also a very wet and cloudy California winter last year. 
I think I’ll end up at 16MWh this year and depending on winter closer to 20MWh next. I also used to have a hot tub I got rid of and a oven that I converted to gas so that was 2 50 amp circuits that were used fairly regularly that reduced my usage that the rigs are now using. 
Yes, it’s selling to the grid. In CA we also get paid retail rates and I still over generate and get paid on my power generation.. but next month will be telling :)

the answer is always "it depends". I happen to have a ton of older GPUs I didn't spend much on, extra MB/CPU/SSD's and solar power on my roof (43 panels!) to boot. The only thing I paid for is really the rackmount case, and my time i suppose.
Reverse of my situation, if i had to buy all the parts, 8 GPU's and didnt have solar, i probably wouldn't have bothered since the ROI is negative for years.

its an interesting problem I havent figured out yet. I use Nicehash and it switches algos all the time. The yellow line is my least powerful rig and it comes in at 800H/s as a normal rate, yet the tiny green line is my 6x R9 290 Tri-X rig and that's at 4.4-6 kHash/s which makes it look weak compared to the other. I'll probably do some math that breaks it all down to H/s, but then i have to worry about Sol/s which I have no idea about since im a noob heh.
Really all that matters is im making about $18/day on free electicity (solar ftw)

Assuming you mean the monitoring rig? I'm an IT executive that can't seem to let the technical side die. 
Here's my setup:
1x 6 GPU rackmount rig w/ 6 AMD R9 GPUs in a 42U Dell Rack (If this goes well, maybe I'll fill the rack)
1x Desktop with 2 Nvidia1080's
The monitoring rig is 1 VM running Graphite/Graphite Web/Grafana. I pull the stats down from nicehash's API and the current BTC price from coindesk's api, and do the math in powershell that runs every minute and drops the raw values into graphite, and then graph it in grafana.
My next step is to enumerate all my GPU's and pull temp's and per-card hashing speeds in with stacked graphs as well and add alerts if temps rise above normal.
Fun stuff. If you guys are really interested in this stuff i can do a deeper write-up with examples. I kinda just did this for myself at the moment.

Here’s my annual stats. Spend 30k and get 43 panels before tax credits (I’m in CA so we have a lot of sun)
