Why the emphasis on keeping btc if you are running a business?  Businesses have expenses: employees, insurance, leases, supplies and tools etc.  Unless enough of their expenses can be paid in btc the decision to hold btc is tantamount to speculating with business funds.  That seems irresponsible considering people rely on this place for a job.  Businesses holding btc is not in my opinion a route to faster adoption.
Edit bicycling instead of btc, auto mistake

A little sensitive eh, don't worry there's no racism on the internet.

Y'all and house music in the same sentence.  The world is a very different place than it was when I was a kid.

Yeah I was sure you were joking, I just wanted to have a poke at you.  Talk about connotations.  Woah.

Why use three frames for a single frame joke?  Crummy in format and thin in content.  Meh

I don't agree with blacklisting, but everyone is free to do what they please with this system.  It's possible blacklisting wouldn't work for a lack of participation or other reasons, and its possible that no matter what we say or do certain holders will insist on using black/white lists as part of their MO.  I think its likely that both of these possibilities and others my little brain cant think of will be a part of the future.  You can act how you choose to and everyone else can do the same, and I think the system is robust enough that we won't "break" it.

The article has about as much information as the title, the information is from a book called Paypal Wars by Eric M Jackson.  I wonder if they targeted things that they could donate for a write off?
Would it be a promotional expense even if they weren't donating the purchased goods?
