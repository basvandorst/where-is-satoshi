Telnet to a university. UUCP if you only wanted email and netnews. The thing about these comparisons is that we don't live in that world any more. New technologies take off in five years, not thirty - Facebook and Twitter are more up-to-date comparisons.
Or PGP, which for how widespread it is, nobody uses thirty years on. Encryption is everywhere, but personally encrypting documents and messages? Most people will never have time for it.

Yes, perhaps. :) There were also sites like the [Cleveland Freenet]( that allowed dialin access, and I have a rather wobbly idea that e.g. Compuserve also allowed it, as part of its walled garden. It was just a different world.
Bringing this back to bitcoin for a moment, the relevance seems to be not that the technology is taking its time to catch on, but that 99% of the population don't understand why it *needs* to catch on - exactly like online communications in 1986.
Twitter caught on because celebrities were pushing it; it changed how people thought about communicating online. There's nothing like that for bitcoin. There's almost no mainstream positive news to get people interested. When there *is* that news ("Man Finds Millions Hidden In Bitcoin!"), we bubble.
But otherwise bitcoin is just a freak story. And moms and pops who dabble in it tend to get burned. It makes sense that it's going to be slow.

I think the mainstream usage of the phrase is the derogatory sense that you used in your original comment ("Sure is conspiracy theory in here"). Or, as Wikipedia put it, "In recent decades the term has acquired a derogatory meaning to some, and distinction should be made between the derisive use of the term and reference to actual, proven conspiracies." Describing something as a conspiracy theory---as opposed to describing it as a conspiracy---carries the sense that the "conspiracy" *does not exist*.
Now go on, tell us how you were referring to an actual, proven conspiracy. I truly cannot wait for it.

You should never generate keys on a website, period. Bitaddress does all its coding clientside, and so if you run it from e.g. a Linux live cd with no networking, it's safe (even if the code is corrupt, it can't call home).

They have the opportunity to do so, and they can learn to do so, and if those options aren't for them they can benefit from the efforts of the wider community - any of us can check through the open bitaddress source and post holes. It's no different to any other open-source project.

Er, people audit projects all the time. Holes are found and fixed every day by exactly those efforts. And if they're not fixed at once (or if e.g. the maintainer of bitaddress turns out to be malicious), those problems are *publicised*. I doubt anyone using bitaddress is not hanging out here or on bitcointalk.
You're in for a shock, too, if you think a developer being "trustworthy" is any guarantee of anything, because massive projects (like the Linux kernel, and I think Apache) have been hacked at their distribution points in the past. The best form of software security, short of cutting your network cable and smashing all your disks, is Linus's Law. Always has been, always will be. It just works: given enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.
As for whether I'm scamming people by saying I found no backdoors in the version of bitaddress I use, you're certainly entitled to think that. I personally think the best form of security for key generators is not a single source on high, but a multitude of independently coded, open source ones, so their outputs can be compared and verified.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:12:05
I did go to that trouble. I read the code and I confirmed that the same throwaway diceware key produced the same keys on bitaddress and IIRC two other key generators. Do you think I'm the only coder in the bitcoin community?

**Text of the WSJ article:**
The virtual currency bitcoin is getting a very real boost on Monday, with the opening of the first licensed U.S. exchange.
Coinbase Inc., a startup backed by $106 million from the New York Stock Exchange, banks and venture-capital firms, said its exchange will offer greater security for individuals and institutions to trade bitcoin and monitor real-time pricing of the cryptocurrency.
The exchange could bring needed legitimacy to the currency, which isn’t backed by a central government and is traded over virtual exchanges, primarily overseas. Coinbase said it has insurance, offering traders some assurance that their money won’t disappear.
Bitcoin enthusiasts have been buffeted by the collapse of Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox last year—taking with it around half a billion dollars of investors’ money—and a security breach earlier this month at Slovenia-based exchange Bitstamp. The value of a bitcoin itself, determined by trading on existing exchanges, has fallen to about $240, from a peak in late 2013 of more than $1,200.
“To have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with bitcoin: its extreme volatility,” said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke University finance professor who has studied cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this.”
Coinbase’s founders say they have been working for five months to win licenses from state financial regulators. They have regulatory approval in half of U.S. states, including large population centers like New York and California. For now, Coinbase can do business with account holders only in states where it has approval.
Coinbase will take a small percentage—likely less than 1%—of most transactions, said Fred Ehrsam, 26 years old, a co-founder. The exchange will initially be limited to users in the U.S., but Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, 32, said he plans to expand overseas.
Mr. Armstrong said he expected to attract both individuals and businesses looking to trade bitcoin. “Our goal is to become the world’s largest exchange,” he said.
Others are looking to open U.S.-based bitcoin exchanges, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin brothers known for their early feuds with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg .
Financial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been scrutinizing bitcoin recently. Benjamin Lawsky , the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, is working on a so-called BitLicense for firms looking to offer digital-currency services in the state; Coinbase is operating under earlier regulations. Mr. Lawsky’s plan is seen as a template for legislation in other jurisdictions, and it may give outsiders more confidence in the currency.
Bitcoins are created using high-powered computers that “mine” for the currency by solving complex mathematical equations. They are exchanged digitally either for currency, or goods and services. Ownership and transactions are recorded, anonymously, in a so-called blockchain, which backers say reduces the risk of fraud.
Bitcoin grew to prominence in recent years in part because of the ease with which it can be transferred.
Coindesk, which tracks the price of bitcoins, says 82,000 businesses accept the currency, double that of a year earlier, including e-commerce site Overstock.com Inc. and Expedia Inc., as well as many small retailers. The value of all bitcoin is $3.2 billion, according to Coindesk’s price index.
The NYSE invested in Coinbase during a $75 million round of fundraising that closed this month. Other investors include USAA Bank, the venture arm of Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters Corp. CEO Tom Glocer. Venture backers include Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.
The NYSE’s investment was intended in part to “keep an eye on bitcoin as it matures as a legitimate currency,” President Tom Farley said. “Any currency relies on its acceptance.” The Coinbase exchange “is an important step for the currency to become socially acceptable.”
Coinbase counts about 2.2 million consumer wallets and nearly 40,000 merchants that use its services. The company has about 75 employees and plans to operate in 30 countries by year-end, up from 19 today.

We aren't talking about the mainstream public, though as I said all of them are at liberty to join in. Like pretty much every open source project, bitaddress.org gains its security from the fact that any of us can check it at any time. As with herd immunity and vaccination, people who aren't computer literate benefit from that process of constant review.
Because bitaddress is a very well-known, widely-used project, and a small one, I believe there are enough people who are both technologically competent and aware of their own security to quickly pick up malware in it.

"plausible" doesn't mean "likely", as your own definition states. It suggests an explanation that sounds good, but has failed on closer examination or on a particular point.
"possible" implies that it's something that might actually have happened, which I don't believe. Note that "a possible explanation" is not the same thing as a possible event.

Proof that only plays in controlled circumstances is one of the hallmarks of a deception, however he did it.

@_date: 2016-05-05 12:31:29
It's possible, but then it's also possible there's a chocolate teapot orbiting Neptune.
The reason he was attacked was *because* he did not present proof at the outset. He allegedly showed it in private. Gavin has said he expected that proof to be what was published, and that he can't explain why it wasn't.
If Craig was Satoshi and wanted to prove himself, he had several routes open to him. He could have signed with the block 1 signature he demonstrated; he could have moved coins.
If he'd done this at the outset, there would still have been questions and conspiracy theories; there always are. But the only reason for the level of scrutiny he received - and extraordinary claims merit extraordinary scrutiny - is because everything he did reeked of a scam.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:02:22
Yea. This is the only way out for him - and I don't mean suicide, I mean that if he is scamming, his only way out of the scam is to insist he can't take the *strain* and the *attacks*.
Craig, man, you *created* the attacks with your refusal to offer proof and your scammy behaviour. Don't act like "okay, show me the keys" isn't 100% the only valid response to "Hi, I'm Satoshi".

Only other thing I can think of is, if you choose to use a passphrase to generate your private key, don't create it out of your own head. You are insufficiently random. Use something like [Diceware]( to generate passwords, and mix up the words it gives you with numbers and symbols. Use at least 10 words.

Look, I'm not a cryptographer, so there may be errors in this, but I do know that the same inputs will lead to the same address and key pair. Always. That's how bitcoin works - the public address is derived from the private key. There's not some magical element in the key that Bitaddress or Armory or whoever can hack, because if they did that, the key would not then produce the same public address. This would be trivially detectable. Accessing a list of pre-generated keys (especially for bitaddress, which, despite your hating on it, is a small program designed to be run offline) would be more than trivially detectable. A child could do it.
*It is possible* for poor random-number generation - and this need not be malicious; computer RNGs often suck - to produce a predictable set of keys. This is why people are suggesting that you produce your own randomness using e.g. a set of dice. Given that all the key generators produce the same address and key for the same input which *you have produced*, you know that they are not fucking with you.
You can even write your own code from the public Bitcoin algorithms, and test it yourself. You can generate your own keys if you want. You should do that.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:03:53

Gosh, someone has a bee in their bonnet. Let me break that one down for you.
No, not all women wanted the vote. Some did not. They were okay with the status quo. *Some* women wanted the vote. They did not have it. The result was that one set of women had what they wanted. The rest did not. The women who wanted the vote won the vote for all women.
The correct thing - the just thing - was to enfranchise all women, and let them freely choose whether or not to vote. Because women are *all different*, and have different opinions, and make different choices. That is our right.
Let's move into the present day. Again, many women are not politically involved, or object to the current political system. They choose not to vote. Many other women, like me, vote. That is our choice to make. In fact, [significantly more women than men vote](
I won't even get into "feminism seeks that you treat women as men"; suffice to say that that is demonstrably untrue and shows no grasp of the subject at all.

What if the NSA are slipping deadly arsenic into your tap water? You test it and you find out. If you aren't competent to do that, you learn how, or you find someone who is competent. 
Likewise, if you aren't competent to read what is really a pretty short piece of code, you learn how. Or you take the word of e.g the people who've pointed out to you that bitaddress produces the same keys as the Linux shell. 
What you don't do is insist that since you can't work a test kit/read Javascript, it must be poisoned/compromised. Prove it, or get out. 
Edit: Bored Vashti is bored. Have some test images. I went to three sites to generate a paper wallet with the same passphrase. They all returned the same results. I wasn't able to figure out how to get blockchain.info to show the private key, but you can see that the public address (which is derived from the private key, AIUI) is identical.

You're talking about how services that store passwords salt them to make them harder to crack. But if you add a non-dictionary element to a string of dictionary words, that's still technically salting it, no matter what you call it. It's an essential step and the XKCD comic doesn't even mention it - in fact, it outright says it isn't necessary.
It's all very well to say "all that extra detail doesn't make a good comic", but I've lost count of how often I've seen people say "correct horse battery staple is a good password because xkcd", and meanwhile people are losing their BTC all the time to shitty brain wallet passphrases.

Are you backing up your USB key? Those things do like to die. Keep multiple copies.
I would say that, to open your backup wallet, you need the key that corresponds to the backup you made. However, I don't use Multibit; hopefully someone who does will chip in. It sounds as if your client is forgetting the key and reimporting it over and over (because you can't access the wallet without it) - so every time it says it's making a new key, it is actually reimporting the same key from the USB drive. But I don't know.

No, your wallet is essentially just a list of addresses and keys. Your transactions, and so the amount of money assigned to those addresses, are all stored in the blockchain.
This is how offline wallets work - the keys are stored safely offline, and the address can be funneled funds and have its balance viewed online with minimal risk. (e.g. if you have a lot of cash on it, it's possible someone will try to guess the key)
If you're planning to store a lot of bitcoins, you should make an offline wallet and not rely on one you generated on your desktop machine.
Edit: Also, you encrypted your wallet before you backed it up, right? Of course you did!
Edit of the edit: There's no reason, really, to make a secure backup like that of a wallet in use. Just encrypt it with a really good passphrase, and back it up in a few reliable places. Storage in safes is for long-term storage, and for that, again, you want to use an offline wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:07:58
What you have there is an SHA-256 hash calculator. But a Bitcoin private key is not pure SHA-256, and you need to compare like with like. Private keys are usually shown in what's called Wallet Import Format (WIF). It adds application information, moves checksums, things like that.
The algorithm is public and is available [here](

Too short and not salted. Rainbow tables to crack combination-word passwords like that already exist.

I personally would not ever generate a paper wallet on a website. If something else feeds you your private key, then, by definition, they know your private key.
Many Linux distributions supply DVD images which you can burn, then boot. Assuming that these are not compromised, they are pretty much immune to viruses. I like [Ubuntu Privacy Remix]( It doesn't have networking, so you can boot from it and know that you have a pretty secure environment with no access to the Internet. It's basically your "always not connected" computer on a DVD-ROM.
Get a USB drive, put the bitaddress html file on it. Power down your PC, plug in your USB drive, boot from your UPR DVD. The system will come up, with your USB drive visible on the desktop. Double-click on it to view the files, and then you can click on the bitaddress HTML file to launch it in a non-Internet-connected browser.
Generate your keys. Take a screenshot of them (I believe it's under Accessories -&gt; Take Screenshot). Save that screenie to your USB drive.
If you aren't up for connecting your printer to Linux (it should be very easy), then write down your address and key. BE VERY CAREFUL since obviously if you make a mistake, you're screwed.
Shut down your PC again. Unplug your USB drive. If you keep your keys on the drive, make multiple backups. If you keep them on paper, make multiple backups. Keep them safe.
Flaws in this system are as follows:
- The Linux distribution could be compromised. (unlikely. besides, since UPR has no networking, it cannot communicate to its home base even if it is. It might have a bitaddress-specific hack in it, but this again is very unlikely.)
- The system you burn your Linux DVD on and save bitaddress from could be compromised. This is on you.
- Physical access (almost) always wins. Your USB drives and/or your piece of paper with your keys are your money. Keep them safe. Keep them in multiple locations in case your house burns down. Once you have Bitcoin data on your USB drive, never connect it to a networked PC again. Ever.

This argument always makes me wince a little, as the original ARPAnet did not use TCP/IP. TCP/IP is the replacement protocol - the Noobcoin to Bitcoin, if you will.

Mmm, but really, the killer app for the Internet back in the day was widespread, anonymous access to (often illegal, depending on jurisdiction) porn. That doesn't mean there's nothing else we can use the Internet for.

Yeah. Snapcard are lovely, but for example if I buy through them I don't get my one-day Prime shipping, can't buy kindle books, and etc etc etc.

The only other thing I can think of is to hit up a trusted friend in the US as an intermediary. I have a couple of people I could ask, but that's a hell of a load to put on a friendship. :/

Maybe a bit harsh, but seriously, if he'd even hit Home to see the start of the line he'd have seen the image/png encoding, and if he'd done a 30 second search he could have seen that the only place that code is referenced is when it's pasted into the output HTML.
Yes, we need to be paranoid, yes, we need auditing, yes, there may well be other errors in the bitaddress code, but this was a really trivial check.

It's more likely than someone not cashing in a billion dollars of bitcoin, let's be honest. But what a legacy.
