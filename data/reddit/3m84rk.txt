I'm more curious than anything. I'm not out to take your house away!

Haha, I work in West Des Moines at Jordan Creek Parkway for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.
I guess I can meet you in person, but could you just scan the doc (blocking out any personal details, obviously)? You can even use your smartphone to scan docs now; fyi.

Call customer service and request to speak with Service Recovery. Explain to them you want a payoff quote and would like to make a request for payoff to the payoff services team.
If they don't know what to do, kindly request to speak with a manager on the floor.
Have fun!

It's not indicative of squat.
The underwriter saw "hey this guy has $7000 in assets", got proof from their document specialist via those screenshots, and had them imaged into the system.
It was one underwriters choice on that.

I'm either going to burn bright or be extinguished. The middle ground can do the rest and be conservative.

You'll get told no by a lot of people, but I took a much as I could from my 401k and personal savings to put in. I dont regret it. I've seen 60% plus gains in the last two months alone. I buy $5-600 a month on top of that with my extra funds.
I could have lost it, too. Don't take advice from internet people. Think your decisions through.

I got a snickers bar last year. It was branded with the company logo with a piece of tape.

Brb starting a new ICO. KTLU.
It's decentralized insanity - the price is designed to spike upon your sells and dip immediately upon purchase. The market is tailored to the individual user who creates their own miniature blockchain upon receipt of their first coin. Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wagn'nagl fhtagn.
