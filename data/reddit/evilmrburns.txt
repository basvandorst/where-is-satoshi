Also consider, that a lot of development is based off of bitcoin core. Bitcoin core GUI will be adding segwit addresses in the UI next release. Expect segwit adoption to increase dramatically after that. Right now, you need to be using a wallet that allows segwit addresses or to get a segwit address through console.

This is correct. The password used in lightning is for the bitcoin wallet. This allows bitcoin to be sent and received on the blockchain, and has nothing to do with the security of your funds inside lightning channels.

@_date: 2018-01-20 21:13:10
Because the bitcoin enthusiasts are downloading the lightning software and testing it.
Seriously. Go download it. If you are tech savy, grab lightning-app binaries and give it a go. If you are, spin up a headless unit and grab lnd and test it out.
Open a couple of channels after grabbing some faucet coins. Then unlock some comment on yalls.org and tell me how long it took for the content to open after you see the payment go across in 2 seconds, or if it is already open by the time you refresh the page.
If you play with it, you'll post about it. It's exciting.

I mean, it's a cool narrative. But, the institutional channel, can't control the nodes they are connected to from opening another channel. And, they can't see the transaction or who it is going to. 
If you want to buy weed with your lightning and are so paranoid, you'd probably just have a separate node, hooked into the nefarious side of the network, where you know, you could just fund it with an on chain transaction with regular bitcoin, and be part of whatever you don't want the KYC's to know about. 
You've imagined up quite a silly story about people being able to control the network. They can't see the transaction and who it's going to. It's encrypted, they only know an amount.

If you had the transaction, you could have saved it, and rebroadcast it. If the fee was too low then, it should have confirmed when you rebroadcast it now that the fees are low. If you didn't save it, they could potentially resend it. You would need to that that up with them, they have no proof of payment in blockchain.

Link me a transaction if you want to continue this. If all of your funds in your wallet are all in segwit addresses, your fees will be lower. However, if the input is grabbing non sw funds at the same time, it will not be lower. Without looking at a specific example, we can just talk all day.

They are likely getting their fee information from the bitcoin client, which is still telling them the higher rates. Their transactions get through in the next block for sure, but they're expensive. They could save a lot of their money (and their investors money) by switching to segwit and using batched transactions. But who cares about that, right?  Brian Armstrong wants bitcoin to fail.

Is it okay to ask a question in here about getting a channel set up?
I have the window binaries for LND. Chain is downloaded. I saw in the github some problems finding channels with your default DNS. Changed to 8.8.8.8 and started finding channels. Let it find them for about an hour, was still finding them. Do I need to find all the channels before I can create a channel?
The channel I'm trying to open is with bitrefill. I see in the logs their pubkey. I open a channel with them with 10 million satoshis, and it pops up in LND with "EOF" in the bottom right, never creating the channel.
Do I need to wait for the channels more? I am unable to open port forward to this machine currently, I did see some stuff about port forwarding. Is that required? 
The other question I have, is currently with the bitcoin on blockchain transactions, I can prove that I own an address, and that I sent a transaction to another address fairly easily.
How simple is it to do that with lightning? My very basic understanding of the lightning network, when and if I take my coins back onto the network, that it will show my new balance, but not all the transactions that have occurred. Will I still be able to prove that I made a payment through the LN to someone else? I'm not sure if this is currently easy to do, haven't quite got a channel open yet.

Well, that would be pretty stupid. If you want to expand on your stupid scenario, you could always open a channel with Bob, and fund his side. Leaving the channel open. Your side has 0 on it, his side then would have BTC he could spend on the lightning network. Since your side starts unfunded, you could not pay the network fee to close it, but Bob could use those funds in the lightning network.

@_date: 2018-01-24 14:59:37


Be informed about transaction fees, and use an appropriate fee for the appropriate time required. 


You don't have to have an on chain transaction to get more BTC into lightning. Those funds could come from another participant in the lightning network into your side of a channel. 


Large purchases greater than the balance of your channel? 


If there is a time limit to the channel, yes. But, keeping channels open for longer periods of time will likely be common. They can be used bidirectionally while the channel has capacity on both sides. The comments from people asking, how they would save money with one transaction when it requires two on block transactions to open and close the channel are trolling at this point or haven't bothered taking 30 seconds to get a background. 


No. Could channels be opened for you as a service? Sure. 


Tap feature doesn't let me pay someone not within 2 feet of me. The LN protocol already is better than that. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:14:22
Also, once lightning is commonplace, you also wouldn't need to open a channel again to top it off. 
Opening a channel is a segwit transaction, current costs to do that are a couple of bucks.

Something like this. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:37:58
Were your transactions likely segwit? 
Looking at the fees is easy. Go to any block explorer, and you can see the fees people paid to get into blocks. Most all list satoshis per byte and the size of the transaction. Where the real discount happens is when you see someone have 1 segwit input going somewhere. Tiny and super cheap.
It's hysterical hearing people say, OMG! $2! My shitcoin does it for free! No thanks. I'll stick with bitcoin and gladly pay the couple of bucks. 
If everyone had switched to segwit, the fees would be that or less for everyone. Until then... it is what it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:19:28
In b4 "10 cents! Shitcoinx does it for freeeeeeeee!!!"
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:16:08
Correct, and it depends what inputs are used. If there are a mix of non segwit inputs, the discount is only applied to the segwit inputs, the other inputs use the 4x multiplier. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:51:38
Thanks for the thorough reply. I'll check out freenode and the mailing list. Keep up the good work. 
I had another thread, where I had a question that didn't really get an answer, maybe you can address that.
Will lightning eventually be part of bitcoin core UI? Right now, it seems with LND that I can do most of the basic bitcoind functionality, would the additional lightning elements eventually be added there?
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:04:21
Fractional reserve is not part of the lightning network design. Nothing in bitcoin or LN is fractional reserve at all. Is there potential for another party to create something? Sure. But that doesn't mean you or I need to use that creation.
Mass adoption of segwit and the lightning network will be incredible for bitcoin. But, at the same time, you'll have to be patient. Lightning, being tested, is amazing. But it is young and has much maturity to do before your grandma is sending you birthday (or bail) money via lightning. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:37:08
With the low transaction fees to what they have been though, anyone wanting to move their coins into a segwit address, that hasn't because they don't need to, and it would just add a transaction... if you are concerned about blocks filling up again, now may be a good time do output those to a segwit address. 
That was a hell of a sentence with no period.

@_date: 2018-01-30 02:11:17
Thank you. I looked at the LND documentation where it requires a specific version of btcd, and it says it requires segwit specifically, not a separate malleability fix like I thought. So there you go They don't have to have it, but they'll need something to malfix, and segwit does it for btc. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:15:00
Okay, again, assuming this is in the future, with LN adoption at least t some degree, why would they have to close the channel to trade btc for fiat? 
Exchanges will have lightning channels open. They can simply send the BTC in their funded channel to the exchange. Instant, and they can trade for fiat if needed. 
There is no need to close the channel. That channel can remain open then to accept more payments.
Everyone thinks they need all these on chain transactions for each step of regular bank. This is changing the status quo. You don't need all these channel closings to move btc.

LN transaction is not similar to a 0-confirmation transaction at all. I see this over and over, and it's some FUD that's been spread. 
A LN transaction cannot be double spend (like a 0-confirmation transaction potentially could be) The funds when received are able to be spent immediately. The only thing that you can't do, is spend the coins on chain, until the channel is closed. However, you could spend them inside the lightning network immediately. 
After commonplace adoption, closing a channel would be less common. Someone forcing a channel closed on you would cost them financially as well, so there would be incentive not to be abusive. 
You need to learn more about the LN instead of saying stuff that isn't true. There are tons of people out tonight, either spreading crap, or deliberately trolling.

You see what the problem is? People say, OMG! $30 fees are killing bitcoin! Just because someone overpaid $30 for a transaction to get into the chain, doesn't mean they have to be that much. In addition, a lightning transaction to open a channel would be a segwit input and output, so roughly half the size of a normal transaction.
Segwit would save block space, and reduce fees. In at least, those two specific ways. But nah, let's just keep using coinbase and whining. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:24:04
Interesting. I like statements backed up by information. Searching what you showed me, I can't find, maybe total number of merchants? However, bitpay, a bitcoin payment processor, showed 2017 to be the biggest year yet, a billion USD of bitcoin payments through them last year, a huge increase.

Specify the full node you're talking about. You do not have to have a btcd full node to send an invoice. You do need a lightning node with a channel open to send an invoice.

@_date: 2018-01-22 13:17:41
But see, how much of this is based on information that has been spread that is wrong? Size of transactions? The current limits in place on LN are just because it's in alpha, not even beta yet. 
Another popular misconception is you need to open and close channels all the time. That the opening and closing saves no transactions. Why would anyone need to close their channel? Refill it and keep using it. As more and more adoption happens, more funds will be available in the LN to accept payments, exchange refills, whatever to top off a channel and continue to use it. 
As LN scales, the block chain will require it as well. LN in the long run, will certainly increase onchain demand if it is what leads to popular adoption of the blockchain around the world. But not because you need to open and close channels constantly. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:06:27
Guys, you're missing something he said. Profitable "today". With the LN on the mainnet being in its infancy and alpha state, there is 0 money to be made there. A few satoshis here, a few satoshis there, if you wanted to "cash out" back to the block chain, the transaction fee would likely be higher.
Unfortunately, the today part of mining is the same thing. You're going to spend a lot of money, and you won't see a profit for a while.
You want to make money from bitcoin? Or you want to support it?
If you're in it to make money, buy some and forget about it for a couple of years. You could lose it all, or it may give you an exciting return.
If you want to support it, test LN on the testnet and if you're confident open a channel on the mainnet.

@_date: 2018-01-21 20:00:20
Take the transaction id, and check it out on a block explorer. It's likely already in a block. If core is where you generated the address, dumping the private key won't lose the transaction that's on the chain. That just will let you load it somewhere else, where the chain is hot and already loaded, and find the funds, even move them if you want to. 
If you're not moving the coins, you can find the transaction, and let the wallet sync if you want to. If you're not interested in running the core wallet, dump your priv keys, and your balance can be imported into a new wallet even if you never download the chain the rest of the way. 
Don't delete anything until you confirm you have all your coins available somewhere else. In fact, I'd say back up that wallet.dat file somewhere safe just in case in addition to whatever new wallet you use.

Just start up the LND node with both --bitcoin.node=neutrino  and --neutrino.connect=faucet.lightning.community and you can replace the default node with another if you prefer. That one, of course is running on testnet like you should be for now.

Okay, I've only kept wallets on desktop. I've never felt I could control the security of my phone as well as I could a pc. But, even being able to set the fee manually seems better than pushing a wallet update out for just changing an arbitrary fee.

Just so you know, I play video games (OMG! Really!) with my kids (oh) and have a youtube channel! You wouldn't believe how many people say that I'm the 50 year old video game player. Doesn't matter how old I actually am, another more popular youtuber said it, so now all the trolls repeat it. 
It never matters the facts. Just the perception. Doesn't matter if fees are a couple of bucks, the trolls will still say that, because THAT'S THE ONLY THING PROPPING UP THEIR SHIT COIN.

This blows my mind. I'm happy to see people get involved in bitcoin. But blindly cashing in a 401k and having your broker get you all in on "this Bitcoin thing" is nuts.
If you want to buy bitcoin, buy it. But, you need to get the basics, so you can take possession of them. To understand at least the basics of how to send or receive them SECURELY. 
And just like the forum suggests, never more than you can afford to lose. 
I've said many times, I love bitcoin. But in this experiment, it's not worth ruining your life over. Bitcoin changes lives, don't make it be for the worse.

No. And in your scenario, bob cannot have a 0 BTC balance for Alice to Send to Carol. But when Bob has a balance, his balance doesn't net change acting as hop along the way. His funds can still be sent. The funds Carol receives, can be spent. 
All without making a transaction on the chain.

50k? Yeah, infinitesimally small. 
Let's consider a few things. The person has to have their address. Correct? So, who did he give his address out to? An exchange? Unlikely they fucked up that bad. 
His buddy that got him into it. Some watch videos for satoshi dust site. None of them probably have that to send. Again, would be a major fuck up.
It's a cool story. I understand him not posting a transaction id, but at the same time, posting it sure could make the doubters stop.
If he did post it, potentially the owner could be found easier. AND, before he sends anything back to a different address based on a claim of ownership, they sure as hell better sign a message with the sending address proving ownership of the sending wallet. 
But yeah, I vote bamboozle.

I think everyone else here is overlooking this, but you're right.
In his scenario, you have two channels. With you the node in the middle of it, you don't just have a pot that can accept limitless amounts of money into a pot. The channel has the $10, would be used up, and you could not lightning $10 into that channel from the $500 if it were not connected to the public channel. 
I'm not sure what risks OP is worried about with the funds being "Locked Up". As far as stolen, it's not like they could just be closed on chain instantly. And if a nefarious node were attempting to steal money, posting the latest signed transaction proving them nefarious would protect the funds. 
Now, what that time lock would end up being in real world applications, who knows, but it's not going to be where if your node goes down for a minute you've lost everything. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:01:39
Why? Because it could be a value added service. Instead of paying an on network transaction fee to send coins, paying that fee to open a channel, that will likely need refunded, and be reused, quite possibly will give the first players in a big market advantage. 
Are they required to? Of course not. That's the wonderful thing about lightning network. You can chose who you open a channel with, and you'll still be able to get payments across it.

There are few alt coins that have real innovation. Just because they can fork an existing project, and have free transactions, doesn't make it worthwhile. Any coin, with enough volume with a blockchain style size restraint, will have fees at enough volume. That's why real innovation is happening with secure contracts off chain, key type changes, and other amazing things.

I have not played with the bech32 format much, but my understanding, is that the only wallet that supports it is electrum. So, it's current use may be extremely limited. You should be able to get old electrum funds over to the new wallet, but their use for now, would be extremely narrow. 
Hopefully we'll see more support for it soon. I know other wallets have expressed integration in the future.

Sometimes, drawing it out, is what helps. Writing it, without specifying who the channel is with and what side the amounts are on, gets terribly confusing.

What questions are those? Inside LND GUI, I can open a channel. Many channels. Download the blockchain, find out about new blocks and when my channels are opened. Send payments. Receive payments. Both instantly on the lightning network.
The GUI certainly needs polishing. Developers are actively working on features and bugs. The too far down the road FUD is silly. Download it yourself and tell me that LN is vaporware. It's not. 
I'm just asking, if LN being developed will be merged into main. I was just curious without searching (having searched and not found the answer) if that was a goal. 
If anyone can point me to the resources to find it myself, that is fine too. 
I can't port forward, or I'd leave my node up for others to connect to. I'll leave the channels open though. My understanding is with my client up and the channels open, payments can still be routed through me, just others can't open a channel with me for routing.

You can ask like-jr about Segwit reducing fees. He says repeatedly that segwit alone will do nothing. It may reduce your personal transaction fee with a native input being segwit at the expense of larger blocks.
Lightning network is alpha software. The protocol is new, and testing is being done. Bugs are being discovered and fixed, and no decent GUI has been released yet for it. There are a few people running the software on the mainnet in addition to thousands running it on testnet. That's not very many yet. So timeline, there is no timeline. There will also be no ribbon cutting party. Adoption will simply increase as the software becomes more reliable and additional features such as simple guis are released allowing average people to take advantage of it.
Schnorr signatures also has no schedule. Similar to segwit, Schnorr doesn't work with old private keys, and existing funds would have to be moved to take advantage of the new features. This is exciting technology, but as far as I'm aware, we aren't even to alpha testing on this.

htlc, has lots of people playing on it, and it's slow. So even when it says failed, sometimes it still goes through but takes some time.
On starblocks, it is a product of eclair devs, and most of the payment channels into them, are all one sided, and they have no capacity. If you open a channel with them and fund your side, you won't have any problems sending to it.

It is clearly not though. With additional airplanes, comes additional costs. If you want equal fees, as more planes are added, more costs are as well. Without knowing an upper limit, that price will have to change in your scenario over time. If not, adding all the planes up front would create huge fees that no one would ever use.

Held answered you correctly, but when running the node, you'd run it as -txindex and pruning is incompatible with that. 
You would need the larger drive if you wanted to do that. Also keep in mind, raspberry pi is pretty light for syncing a full node. Can it be done? Yes, does it take a while? Yes. Check  and looking at possibly side loading the block chain. 
EDIT: Also, you don't have to run a full node to run lightning. You can use neutrino to connect to another full node and get the block information from them. That would allow you to run it without an external hard drive at all. You could run a lightning node on a rpi off just an ssd card.

I'm not arguing with those definitions. I'm saying they're likely lying about which step it's actually at.
Seriously, like gemini for instance. Do you see how much slack coinbase is getting for it being planned? WTF wouldn't they deploy it if coinbase is taking that much heat? They have it in an eternal state of ready, and they take much less heat and haven't deployed it for months now. 
Segwit is awesome, but the SIMPLE change of batch transactions could save an entire factor of space on the block chain. Places like bitstamp already do both. It's disgusting. But then again, for the American exchanges, maybe the regulators don't want it. Who knows. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:59:49
That is lnd running a full node. 0.7 is 70% of one core, yes, and that is also limiting it with cpulimit and niced to lower priority... it will chew up as much cpu as you'll throw at it and vps doesn't like that with shared resources :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:49:09
There are soft coded size limits currently implemented into the alpha software. They can be removed at any time. Fees in regard to transaction limits can be done both on chain or in lightning, but with lightning still being instant. There will certainly be pros and cons to using one or the other at various dollar points.
Keeping a channel open does not assume BTC only economy. It assumes mass adoption. There is no reason keeping channels open is dependent on BTC being the only form of currency. 
I still think even you are thinking short sited and banks are our overlords. You said


Why? If LN is greatly adopted, why do they have to close the channel? They can just LN funds to an exchange to cash out to fiat. Getting it onto the block chain is not a requirement for sending BTC to another person in well adopted LN scenario.
I see this misconception over and over and over. Even when they think, yes, it can be used many places, the first place people go is, well you need to close the channel to get your fiat for people not on LN. Still not true...
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:14:45
In addition to Korberos reply, remember not to forget, that to use the lightning network, you'll need to make an on chain transaction to open a channel. Then if you want your funds out, you'll have to make another on chain transaction to close the channel. There will still be on chain transactions. Lightning network doesn't replace the chain, it utilizes it to expand it and make it better and faster. 
Edit, the shills can't handle the truth lol.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:33:52
Yes, a lot of people don't understand that. But, they also then assume, that since it can't, you can only make payments between two parties and then just settle back on the chain, and are completely missing the fact, that the power of lightning is the next step, where the network of channels allow instant credit of balances between channels, without custodial risk, to whoever. 
It is really simple. But, you have to understand the whole thing. 
The problem people are having, is the get the first part. Then they hear some shit. It confuses them, or it changes what they had already got on part of it, making a latter part not work.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:57:56

i) Bitcoin core node can be run on a rpi3, yes. Search google, there are tons of it. In fact, a half a dozen people were asking about it on this subreddit last night.
ii) This is really kind of a silly question. Playing games on your computer that increases the heat, lowers the life span. For every x degrees c warmer, expectancy is lowered by y%. Will bitcoin do this significantly more than other intensive programs? No.
iii) Yes, if you're still on your rpi3, you can nice the bitcoind, and you can also cpulimit it. Look up their respective helps if you don't know how to use them.
iv) Pruning the node will save you space on your hard drive. You'll no longer contribute by sending old blocks to others on the network but you'll verify and rebroadcast new transactions.
bonus) I can speak only for lnd, but lnd comes with a bitcoin wallet. You'll use that one for opening channels. You do not need to keep funds in that outside of what you need to open a channel with, so the rest of the funds can be stored in core. You should be running this on testnet, so, you shouldn't be too concerned at this point.
point ii) Your question isn't clear, but I'll just point out, you do not mine bitcoin with GPU's and haven't for a long time. Check the side pannel of this subreddit.

Bulls don't want to hear it, but a stable price on bitcoin while the software and second layers continue to mature wouldn't be a bad thing. Wherever that stable price would hit.
Bitcoin very long, has, and will continue to change the world. But you can still see their start point when looking back. The road is long.

Who has the channel with Mary? Bob? 
Make the channels look like this. In our first example
Alice &lt;- 0BTC - 1BTC -&gt; Bob, because you opened a channel, funding it for bob, 1BTC on his side. Now, Bob can't send that BTC to anyone else that he has a channel open with. It won't work. Those funds are on his side of the channel and can't be moved to another channel, with him as the node in the middle. However, if YOU have the channel open with Mary that has 1BTC on both sides, let's say it looks like this.
Mary &lt;- 1BTC - 1BTC -&gt; Alice &lt;- 0BTC - 1BTC -&gt; Bob
Now, Bob can send Mary up to 1BTC through you. Let's say he sends 0.5 BTC. Now, when that is done, the two channels look like this: 
Mary &lt;- 1.5BTC - 0.5BTC -&gt; Alice &lt;- 0.5BTC - 0.5BTC -&gt; Bob
So how the channel sides re-balance?
Now, people can send Bob up to 0.5BTC through your channel with him, now that you have capacity on your side again.

You aren't supposed to do anything. If you want to move old addresses over to segwit, now may be a good time with low fees if that's something you wanted to do.
Not something you need to do. Not something you have to do. If your funds are in cold storage with no plans to use them soon, then there is no need to hurry and get your coins moved.

Dr \u\cdecker a serious question for you based on a comment you made. 


So why on the mainnet? Can you do this on the testnet for us too? Where can I go to get help about lightning and improving it? I've joined the slack, and my questions go unanswered for &gt;24 most never getting even any response.
I've opened up 12 channels, tested every send I can. Send and receive with strangers from reddit. A few hiccups, but it's working. 
So, put some stickers on the testnet. Sure, I'm more technically savvy than some, but certainly nothing crazy. Lightning questions asked on either get no answer, or they get trolled by the bcash people. 
I want to help. But, without being able to ask questions, get feedback, am I even helping with my node on testnet? 
I get random EOF errors, and simply payment cannot be routed. There is no information in the logs for me to know wtf is going on to submit anything.
I want to help. What can I do? My balls are too small to open a channel on the main network. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:10:32
Lightning isn't ready for product. It's alpha software. It would be silly to try and get businesses to adopt software that for example, if you put a negative invoice in LND, the whole wallet explodes. Not quite ready yet.
With all your experience, help test. Don't try and get adoption where it's not ready.

I mean, there is no implementation with a decent GUI. That's not a bug, but again, time. The lightning-app is awful. I mean, it does the basics, and let's people test that don't  have command line skill, but really, awful. That's certainly not a bug of the protocol though.
Implementation between the 3 companies making their apps, there are still some incompatibility issues popping up.
If you want to see bugs, check out github. One that was just found recently, was creating an invoice with a negative balance messes the client up a little bit. Not breaking, but certainly inconvenient. you could imagine a script calculating invoices, could potentially have an error where a negative invoice may be created.

Lightning is not ready for mainnet. If you would like to test, there are plenty of resources for the testnet. Lightning software is still alpha software. Not even beta. Money can be lost. Bugs are being found.
If you are technically savvy and still wish to proceed, you'll be able to figure out how to use existing software on the mainnet. No one is making compiled binaries for mainnet testing.

Well, certainly, creating their own system for fee data would be better. Even if they used their own and checked it against a historical basis compared to what the client says, and then maybe a 3rd party api to make sure their fee isn't out of whack. 
Segwit is awesome. But batching, they could reduce the size by 80% right there, which saves them could hard cash. When you are talking tens of thousands of transactions per day, potentially thousands of on chain transactions overpaying $10-$20 per transaction... you're talking maybe 100k per DAY wasted. WTF. You can't hire 10 programs to fix that shit and get it tested? Come on. It's crazy. If I were an investor in coinbase, Armstrong's head would be on the chopping block.

Not sure what you mean specifically. Having never used it, I assumed there was always some way to change the fee manually. Since those numbers were hard coded it looked like, I was just asking a question. Even for those numbers to be pulled from an API seems better than having to push an update out to change the default fees. And certainly, editing code wouldn't be required for simply making a variable able to be set in say, the settings. Right?
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:20:53
There will not be good reasons to close channels constantly. The point will be to open them and use them.
Back to our theoretical scenario, The channel you have with Bob, he can send money through your channel to others, if you have other channels open. If he has other channels up, he cannot spend the coins you sent to him, because they are all on his side of the channel.
Stop listening to the noobs on reddit, and go read the lightning network white paper and developers blogs about how it works. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:54:14
I dunno, always shared transaction fees. I've seen a few things that showed that if it wasn't the best payout over a long time it was close. Add in the up time and the way he supports bitcoin, makes it number 1 in my book, but I never got into asic's past the butterfly labs jalapeno joke. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:01:48
Your question is poorly written.
In channel 1, What are both sides of the channel funded as? 
Because, in channel 2, you are saying, that the channel is funded 100% by Bob to Carol, so Bob has 0 balance on his side and can only receive from channel 2?
If that is the case, there is no route from Alice to Carol. 
In this scenario, either, Bob needs a new channel, or funds from Carols side to route with Alice.
But, if a great lightning network scenario, if Bob were to buying BTC on an exchange, they could be send to his channel through Carol, and he wouldn't need to to settle to then have a spendable balance on his side.
In your scenario, no, it cannot route. Thinking outside of A B C, you would not have to go back to the chain to get funds available. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:56:16
The dollar amount is irrelevant. It's the size of your transaction and if your inputs are segwit inputs. But likely? $2-$4. It depends on what wallet you are using to send if it is done automatically and how much control you'll have.

My understanding basically, is no. They need a malleability fix but it doesn't have to be Segwit. 
They can have a fix without segwit, but unless they use someone elses code, where are they going to get it from? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:46:59
Currently, there is no problem keeping them there. Segwit is backwards compatible and not a problem. I would have a hard time believing that we would have a breaking hard fork change unless some terrible vulnerability were discovered. Your funds would not be at risk by being cold, but the vulnerability could put them at risk if you just left them after the changes were made.
All hypothetical of course. Nothing like that has happened since bitcoin started.

I don't use samouri, so I can't tell you much about it. I do know it is segwit compatible, so, do you know if your inputs are segwit addresses? And you're sending to another segwit address? You mention lowest setting. They may have some arbitrary amount set. But if you are not sending a segwit transaction, $10 is still more than double that. Are you getting in the first block or two still? Without giving a transaction to look at, I'd just be hypothesizing all day, and without knowing how your wallet actually sets fees, and if you can flat out specify or not, I really can't answer your question.

I'm using LND with the command line. The gui version tells you nothing like you said. LND is great, but you need to get the information yourself and not use the gui. 
The purpose of lightning isn't to open a channel with whoever you want to send payment to, but for now, some services that's what you'll have to do.

The problem with everyone understanding how lightning works, is, people have only really had the chance to play with it on the testnet, it's still young. If you haven't really dove into it yet, the answer, isn't easy to find yet. If you've played with it, you know the answer is a single funded channel.
Bcash trolls are like any other reddit trolls. One tactic is to ask you questions until you just honestly don't know the answer or don't bother responding to the troll. Then they use that as a, see, he can't answer it, I'm right. Along with all the other FUD, they're still just trolls.

Let me try and help you understand the best I can. In your scenario, I'm going to assume a few things, so if you had a different idea of how it works, hopefully I can clear it up, or feel free to ask more questions.
I'm going to assume you already have bitcoin in your trezor. I'm going to also assume you use coinbase as an exchange. 
So right now, you have bitcoin on chain. Right? 
Next, you want to open a lightning channel. So you can buy, groceries? Your VPN subscription? Tip online. Gamble? Whatever. So, to do that, you need to open a channel with a peer. That peer, could be anyone. Likely, coinbase will allow people to open channels with them. It's a logical step that exchanges will allow btc to be transferred into a lightning channel. So, you can use your trezor, to open a channel with them. It will take an on block transaction to do this. Alternatively, exchanges may allow you to withdraw from their web wallets, into a channel. 
You still with me? This on chain transaction opens a channel. It requires a few confirmations to be accepted on LN as open. Then, through this channel, you can interact with the lightning network.
Now, in this channel, let's say it has 1 btc in it. You can spend, up to 1 btc to one or many many places with very little fees. So, spending it all in one transaction, probably doesn't make the most sense. Why not just send it on the block chain? The bang for the buck goes when you're making many smaller payments. Now, 1btc, is a lot of money, I just used a number, and I'm not going to go back and change it. In the current state, that amount isn't even possible right now, but can be changed later. 
If you were done with the channel and want your money back on your trezor, you would need to close the channel. This is another on chain transaction that requires a fee. 
However, with mass adoption, closing a channel could be uneeded. The exchanges will likely maintain balances in channels, and instead of withdrawing and opening a channel, they can send additional funds to your channel and top you off. So, you could buy more btc at an exchange and they top you off. 
People selling bitcoin, could send funds into the exchange channel, and not need to wait for confirmations to sell on the market. 
You could accept money from a friend on the lightning network. Reimburse you for that hot dog stand that only takes cash? (That's so 2017) He hops onto his lightning wallet, scans your invoice, and transfers you over a couple thousand satoshis for lunch.
How is that? I'm trying to tell it like a story to help. Tell me if I helped or confused you more. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:11:38
It does not. There are some programs (authy) that have restore features based on your phone number. But google authenticator uses a seed that is generated from the provider side to create the 2fa tokens. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:35:55
You're right. However, the address you are generating probably stars with bc, correct? I don't know any exchanges that accept that. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:34:21
Bitcoin core works. You'll have to get a segwit address through command line though. 
Electrum uses bech32 segwit addresses, and they're about the only one, otherwise electrum is awesome.

If anyone sees this reply, I would urge those interested in testing, to not use mainnet, but to please test on the testnet where the majority of users are currently experimenting at. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:04:04
These big exchanges bring in millions per day in trading fees. Sure there is security, but if you're raking in the dough, you really ought to scale with demand a little better. Or more lambo's. Whatever right?
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:36:10
This one really sets of the bcashers. They have 32MB blocks over there! So what? You're average block size is 100kb and is mostly just people trading them for other shitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:39:17
xkcd really is kind of creepy sometimes. How about this one? I was just reading some early adopter fixing the problems with crypto with his new project. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:02:29
And those circulating supply numbers, can increase at the developers whim. Very scary. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:23:26
How many channels do you have open? What receiving capacity do you have on that channel? PM me an invoice and I'll send you a few satoshis under your receiving capacity. If you're connect to starblocks and yalls I should be able to hit your channel just fine. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:33:59
Call it propaganda if you want to fool yourself. Blocks are around 100kb on average. You can check for yourself. Since you're lazy, here's a link. 
that 100kb I'd hypothesize, is mostly trading the shitcoin.
Yup, propaganda.

You can change the data directory like this if on windows, change your shortcut target like:


Then move your existing files over with the client shut down so you don't redownload everything.

Thank you. I was searching all over, finally found the cap, but then couldn't find documentation on why it existed. Cheers.

I don't remember who my upline is. No wonder I'm not getting the support I need. Will someone adopt me into their line? They can have the benefits of my downline. It's small but growing. I just need the support.

Well, if by yes, you mean yes, because you can connect to a neutrino node that is a full node, then yes. Otherwise, no. You could just connect to a neutrino node, that is a full node.

Catch fire? Come on...
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:19:39
I mean, I can't even ask you to post a bitcoin address without you taking that effort. So your question, is impossible. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:49:36
But don't you still see? The exchange won't accept you. So what? You find another node. And since that exchange is connected to your uncle phil, you can send money to your uncle, even though you haven't KYC'd to the exchange.

For an incoming lightning transaction, you have to send an invoice for a specific amount. You will not get random incoming payments without having provided an invoice to the sender. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:42:36
Without the reference video, I couldn't tell you more about what wallet they were using. Using either the LND CLI, or the lightning-app for windows desktop, you have to paste in the payment request. The payment request lets you see the amount and memo, then you can send. So, the way that the payment invoices work, I doubt all they had to do was click a link. I would anticipate an app could accept that click, but will then show you the invoice amount and allow your approval. With or without a password. Again, just conjecture based on what you're telling me you saw. I have to believe that's the case because a lightning payment URL just looks like a bunch of jibberish until it's decoded.
Entering your password on LND can be done every time you open the client or you can make it so the password can be bypassed. 
In reply to your side note, I think you'd have to explain more. Are you saying I'm not being nice, by calling out your ridiculous comment? I don't think it's a waste of time. 
Like the other redditor replied to you with, how secure is your Visa having a rfid chip that can be scanned from a few inches away?
It's a wallet. It must be secured. Sure there's a narative that cryptocurrency is monopoly money, but it's not. It should be protected, just like you protect real money. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:07:26
I mean, since the transactions are essentially free, it wouldn't take much effort to send 3 payments to pay for something larger. 
I don't know enough about it to know if the 0.42 is a hard cap that can't be changed, or just a current arbitrary number assigned for now. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:56:41
Oh good, the FUD patrol is here. I was worried you guys all took Friday night off. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:25:11
And before the trolls get here, having an exchange doesn't make lightning centrally controlled. The protocol hasn't changed. They can't steal your funds if you go offline overnight. They can't freeze funds. They can't stop you from purchasing that naughty subscription. 
Exchanges are a natural place for people to connect to the lightning network. They can top up a channel with more funds without another on network transaction. In fact, the first on network transaction likely will be paid for by the exchange themselves and you'll have no fees to start sending on the lightning network.
We're a long ways away from exchanges offering this functionality, but it would be refreshing for an exchange to offer a mock exchange on the testnet this year for people to really see how this would change things for an average person. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:55:57
It's easy to have low fees if the blocks are empty. Bcash hasn't proved anything. The couple of spam tests they did to get a couple of big blocks, were just that, a couple of test blocks. Not block after block of stuffed full real user transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:20:44
Yes it does. It's a segwit transaction. Both in, and out. 1 segwit input.  So right there, the segwit transaction gets the base 1x multiplier instead of 4x. So, 4x cheaper. 1 input, not several. Cheaper. 
What part don't you get and maybe I can help you understand. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:13:38
And look at the mempool history. Interesting how so many transactions have the same 400 satoshis/byte fee. Since that is what coinbase sends on all their transactions, regardless if it is needed or not.
An average transaction fee means nothing, if the mempool is emptying, and much lower fees work just fine.
But, like I said, keep up with your narrative. At least you have a $23 number to clutch onto currently. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:34:48
Oh hell yeah. I'm on it. Wish me fake luck.

@_date: 2018-01-18 23:29:49
I know, I know, don't respond to the trolls.
How do people get their coins off an exchange? Just like the exchange sending you btc, the exchange can open a funded channel for you (same on scale effort as sending you your coins) No multiple hops, the coins are now in an active channel waiting for you to spend or to receive more funds at. 
Of course, since you're trolling, you don't care. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:05:38
The question includes, what if they have none, can they get some if they don't have any. Or would it have to be sent off chain, so they can open a channel. The other comment said they were not sure, but maybe could open a 0 channel. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:25:49
Just tar -zxvf it to a directory you want to run bitcoin from and continue the tutorial.

Thanks. Is anyone able to confirm that you could open a channel with 0 btc? Obviously no payments go go through that channel with the exception of receiving. But I'm just curious if it works like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:13:33
I literally posted this yesterday, and was down voted so hard and trolled, I deleted it...
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:24:37
Honestly, the only reason I haven't used them yet, is people are saying they've been waiting weeks to get verified. Think I'll just wait a bit and see if things calm down first. Otherwise, I'll be signing up. 
They say they are segwit ready, but not pushed out yet. Push that shit out please.

Wouldn't you love to see Satoshi dump millions of this fork coins haha
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:06:08
You missed one on your list. Anything lightning network related, there are two people. One that asks when it's coming. Another replying 18 months. Lightning network is out today, testnet, and main net. But, that doesn't mean the trolls won't stop their FUD. Poor bcash cry babies. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:02:55
Cheers. There are tons of FAQ's or wikis on it, but there is a lot about it, and I just can't find that specific question. So thanks again.

I think that's great advise. Let tracer be the asshole. Don't beat yourself up for your own decisions. I agree with tracer. GTFO quick. You'll at least have the fiat and huge gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:15
Watching that was awesome (I love pushing youtube to 2x speed haha) So yes, you can open an exhausted channel with the point of it being funded. So, you can receive on LN without funding. Perfect. So then, that person could close the channel if they wanted the coins back on the chain.
Awesome, I can't wait for it to be implemented more!
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:22:33
Look at the old bitcointalk forums and look up mrburns DoS attack on the blockchain. Satoshi pushed a couple of commits out after he had initially told me that DoS was a problem to solve later and I showed him how easy it was to do at the current time.

Next up. Getting facebook messages saying they hacked your facebook account, stole your naughty pictures from your phone, and want bitcoin or they send it to all your friends. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:07:10
So, on my website, I have a contact us form, that has a google recaptcha on it, so, they at least have to fill that out. On my site, accept bitcoin, so they don't look at the site too much I guess.
And I didn't even bother going to their site, but I assume it's some affiliate program referral, pay for hire to complete the set up, or one of the millions of the scams out there. 
Anyway, the text in that first line isn't wrong. Users just need to learn for themselves how easy it is!

So many posts like this right now. They're so funny. OMG! I lost 200 in 5 weeks, bitcoin is dead.
hahah gtfo
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:54:44
Yes, let me help you out. Go back in time, and stay away from bitcoin as your get rich quick scheme. 
It's been repeated over and over. On the sidebar, there is a link, called Don't invest recklessly. If you have to withdraw your money after 5 weeks because you have no other choice, then you invested recklessly. That's your own fault. If you don't listen to the basic advice of the community (which is not, everyone gets a lambo if you buy bitcoin and sell in 5 weeks) but, learn, invest only what you can afford and are willing to lose, and hodl these coins out of my dead hands, then no one here can help you.
Try again though. Learn more. That's the most important thing you can do right now. You apparently know nothing about bitcoin. Spend the next 5 weeks learning about it. 
Then you can go from there. Toss 20 quid into bitcoin when you can afford to lose it. Put it on a paper wallet and forget about it. 
Then you'll really be HODL'ing, see in you 5 years.

Quick question, I'm cloning the git, and when I start LND it says [INF] LTND: Version 0.3.0-alpha any way for me to pull the beta from git?
