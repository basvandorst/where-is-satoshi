Can you walk me through this? I honestly don't understand.  You are saying people sell their asset (NYSE securities? Bonds? beach house? Ferrari? what exactly?), buy bitcoin with the money to "hide the asset", then rebuy the asset in January?
What taxes are they avoiding with this strategy?

1) not paying taxes when buying/selling things.
2) you could also repatriate offshore funds - buy bitcoins with the money and then buy things with the bitcoins.
3) You can also just dump money into bitcoin throughout a year and report lower income than you actually generated (because you’ll actually have less money in your accounts)
Can you walk me through how any of these explain the January dip?  Which of 1, 2, or 3 were you referring to when you said:


You said this is obviously what's happening.  I'm not understanding the strategy you are suggesting.  Can you walk me through exactly what you see is happening? It's obvious to you, but not obvious to me.

Thanks.  I don't see the advantages to this strategy over the ordinary plan of hiding ownership of assets in trusts (the usual meaning of the phrase "hide your assets").  The disadvantage is that you have to completely liquidate to cash, then to bitcoin, then back to cash, then back to what you actually want.  That is an INSANE process if you are trying to use this capital to operate a business.  I think it's far more likely that there is no pattern and it is just random variation.  I could be wrong.
