If I owed a dispensary, I would GLADLY accept Bitcoin! I owe a lot to bitcoin, and the community. :)

People here saying they love to see this is frustrating... As a medical marijuana farmer, on the cusp of being a recreational farmer, this news BLOWS! I know so many folks that want to be able to use their money and live life with less hassle. I WANT to pay taxes. I WANT to be legit and an open book. I WANT to keep my money somewhere safe. I doubt any of you here even have a dog in this fight. I don't want to hide in secrecy any longer. What I do isn't bad  and doesn't hurt anyone. I want to help people, and contribute in a positive way to my community. Most growers I know, feel the same way. 
Proof, check my history.

I got my coins I wanna say 2 years ago?? They were 11 a piece 
@_date: 2013-06-18 05:10:54
Ummmm... Don't you make miners???? Is 1300 really THAT important?

I ask because, I'm completely out on bitcoin. I cashed out a few weeks ago and I'm currently in escrow on the new house I bought... ;) .. I'm more considering a small investment in hopes of another long shot. I was less then 1000$ invested in bitcoin, and ended up with a house. For Christ sake, I only got in to bitcoin to get some pot here and there on the silkroad!  I'm hoping that the rise in price and legitimacy with bitcoin only drives more speculators to litcoin and feather coin...

If there is one thing I've learned on reddit today, it's this... is a vagina...

Although, I'm kicking myself for cashing out... Could have had the house completely paid for, and a damn Ferrari... Hehe

Say what you want.... I'm going to be a home owner... Bla bla bla.. Basically, I'm saying nothing can bring me down, and to lick my happy puckered butthole.  ;P
Edit... This comes from so much love. :)
