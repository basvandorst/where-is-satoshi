You are right. I guess this is part of being a new currency.

You sound like people thinking to invest in bitcoin at 19K (Is very likely to be profitable). LOL

I agree with your points. But I also agree with the idea that if I am not able to use Bitcoin to go and buy groceries then you can not fucking call it a currency yet.

Well, maybe you need to check again it's definition: "Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator." :D

Instead of mining now you beat it ;)

Pictures or it didn't happen. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:46:26
Yeah. Saying stuff like "I don't care about definitions" cause you make your own rules doesn't sound teenager at all. ;)

The funny part is that when you try to find more info about this you find out that the only ones replicating this information are shady crypto webpages. Something tells me that the brand new head of China's central bank is not a liberal thinker that embraces more power to the people and less to the government. :D

LOL, so you are just following this shapeless headless "unicorn" down the rabbit hole? Hahahaha, now that's an strategy. I know you love the hype but if you really want Bitcoin to be taken seriously don't ever do comments like that again. It's really sad. :D

So you are the reason why the price tanked today. Bastard!

Daniel knows his shit man. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:31:15
Hodl man! 
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:17:06
And it is cheaper than a Bitcoin! I will get 3. :D

Doesn't Bitpay and uphold destroy the purpose of Bitcoin? They will automatically change the value of the transaction to US dollars (minus a fee). Wasn't the idea to have a self regulated currency that won't need to pay a transaction fee and that could be accepted everywhere without the need to be converted?

It is in deed. I still think that if Amex, Master or any third party start to capitalize on Bitcoin transactions and the end user starts to pay for their "service" then the purpose of Bitcoin is broken. Thanks anyway for the quick response.
