I don't believe any of this, I think you just want money.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:54:51
That's awesome!
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:35:25
Thank you very much.

"Although the online retail giant does not accept Bitcoin directly, Purse.io matches buyers with gift card holders creating an extremely powerful use-case: online shopping."

Dollar cost average. You do not know when the peak or trough is occurring until its too late.

Smart! If we believe in the long term value of Bitcoin, the downturn is simply a time to invest. I'm in a similar boat, bought when it was both high and low, and feeling great right now!

Speak for yourself. Both sides of my parents want me to help them invest, its been like that for years, as they trust me and we have a great relationship.

All the libertarians all of a sudden in favor of government regulation because its hurts them directly.... Unbelievable hypocrisy right now. (This is not directed at the person who posted this). 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:28:44
Ok, but $7,800 to $5,600 is way more than 7%.....
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:17:26
It is hypocritical to not want any government regulation, until it directly affects you. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:43:42
Oh i'm with you, I bought the dip, as i usually do, i'm a long term buy and hold (HODL), but just to be fair, it hit 7800 then went down to 5600... But I hear you.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:52:35
Yes to all this.

YUP! They sent me a standard email about how to redo the authorization thing, but i did have to email them about 3 times to ask for help and it may have taken a month or so if i recall, so be persistent! good luck.

Your assumption is that every family is like yours, that's all i was trying to correct.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:59:20
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:45:55
Fair. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:37:55
Did you sell?????? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:54:23
“Honestly, I am just shocked that anyone can’t see it for what it is.”.... Ironic, no?
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:20:42
Did your friend sell? If so, yea i feel bad that someone does not really get it. If they did not sell, he did not lose anything.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:07:21
I think so yes.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:56:17
How do people still say its not valuable when it is accepted by Expedia and microsoft and many other major companies, why would a big company use bitcoin if they did not see value in it? I just don't understand this....

ah yes, simpler than I thought ha! Thank you!

How many weeks did you wait? I'm about 2 weeks into waiting for them to reply for the same issue......
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:41:42
Thank you very much.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:54:42


This is good to know, I have to do the same, and i've waiting on their customer service to get back to me....
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:52:30
I don't know if you are accurate but i'm really curious, can you explain how you did the math?
