Lool my point proven above.

Lol they are just earning their living. Sometimes its funny when these working class fools who have invested in bitcoin think they are ruling the world in 5 years. Its just an investment...

These guys are just like bankers you guys always hate, scammers. This is what your currency relies on boys.

Read my comment again. If you do your own research and you dont fall to the ”hodl” and ”crash” memes you are going to good or at least you have better chances at doing good.

Currently 99% who own bitcoin dont give a shit about the idea, just looking to make easy cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:08:56
Lool this made me laugh
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:44:06
95%, 96%, 97%, who cares.. If you follow any news, go to any forums or have a little bit of common sense you would know.

Sir are you retarded? The current futures volume are like 0.01% of these new futures. Also you can short only small amounts of money currently but these new exchanges allow big players getting in.
You must really be looking world thru bitcoin-anarchist glasses if you think they dont have power.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:54:38
Lol avatrade allows you to short like 0.01% of money what you can short on these new exchanges. Do your research.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:44:11
Yes with its possible, its possible it goes even lower like 100$, returning to its roots
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:43:00
Lool you really fell for the memes
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:45:01
Lool and they say its not a bubble...This post clearly represents the 3rd stage of a bubble: ”when every granddad and uneducated fool puts money in without even thinking what they are doing”.
Jking but cmon man you got to really sort your things out..

This is what this sub has became to? We should start a discord or something to have an educated conversation looking things from all persoectives. Retards like this guy are just ruining the community.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:35:03
Bot go away.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:01:18
You are the cancer of this community. Yelling memes does not help anyone, you can go do that on Instagram or something.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:31:10
Spot on. Bitcoin is extremely risky invesment which ofcourse means huge possible profits but it worries me when people put over 10% of their wealth into it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:59:46
Was not speaking to you, sorry. I was speaking to the guy who said GTFO to you. You have a good question but unfortunately I cant answer it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:39:58
Maybe its coming, maybe not but the fact is 99% of people owning bitcoin dont dream about buying stuff with it. They dream about making money fast and cashing out to fiat to buy stuff, doesnt that worry you?

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:37:45
Lol bitcoin wont succeed if everyone holds...
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:29:43
Lighting network has been ”coming soon” like 5 years and 99% of people who own bitcoin treat it as a speculative investment. Stop spreading ignorance, please.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:45:52
Dont fall for the memes and do your own resereach.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:36:49
”Bitcoin will never stop rising” lol yeah right
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:28:32
Tell him that he needs to sort that bottle desig. Looking like Walmart $5 vodka currently.
