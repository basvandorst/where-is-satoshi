Buy low, sell high. (not financial advice)

This is my technical understanding, and I’m not 100 percent sure about this. So here it goes
Do you want to be able to download all of the worlds financial data or not? It’s a yes or no question. Lightning network doesn’t allow it. Bsv does. Period. Whether you have enough money to do so doesn’t matter. No one gives a flying fire truck because one day light aggregations of this data can be assembled on request so you won’t need the whole thing. (Only what you query) 
For simple validation nodes: all transaction data can be pruned to allow for your shitty raspberry pie to validate with the network.
If what I said is true: Everyone on lightning is a piece of shart for lying to everyone about this simple reality. They will pay a big price soon.

We should make a smaller version of “imo” for scammers, so they can hide even more effectively that everything they say is all just a shit opinion

If someone tells you they have a big penis. You then ask them, prove it! They tell you, no. They then say, "i will prove it to you indirectly, see that woman over there? Ask her.". But this doesn't satisfy you. You then ask yourself, it would be incredibly easy for this guy to prove he has a big penis, but he doesn't do it. That must be proof he doesn't have one! Your logic needs work.
