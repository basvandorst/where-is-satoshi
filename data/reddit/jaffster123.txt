As already stated, no single entity owns bitcoin. The only time anybody could "take xontrol" is with a 51% hack. Meaning they control 51% of the miners.
This would cost BILLIONS to do and an incredibly vast knowledge of cryptography and economics. This won't happen any time soon, trust me.

This. I've not heard this phrase in years D:

Do yourself a favour... Cash out most of your BTC but not all. 
Stick a small amount into an offline wallet and forget about it. I did this when I bailed @ $800 and I'm so glad that I did. It's still there, if BTC ever hits $100k then I'll sell that last BTC that I have.

I think the third world is going to get the most out of this technology. Just like how many people in the 3rd world didn't have landline phones, mobile phones allowed them to leapfrog that old tech. Now EVERYONE has a mobile phone,including in the 3rd world.
Given that the majority of the 3rd world don't have Access to a bank account, bitcoin will easily replace the need for a bank there. I hope it does. I sincerely hope that one of the technologies biggest impacts is on the third world and this sudden ability to send their money to anybody in the world, without any corruption worries.

You can cloud mine, plenty of providers provide it. But everything is ASIC now, mining on a computer is pointless now.

Me too, but I doubt we'll ever know the facts. With RBS group being primarily owned by the government (after the bailout, 73% of the group remained in control of the government IIRC?), I would assume that they definitely had something to do with this.

If you watch any of the mainstream media in the UK it's quite clear that this had government pressure pushing it along.
EU leaders are meeting on Thursday to talk about further sanctions against Russia for their involvement in Syria... I'm sure that this is just another piece of that very big puzzle being put into place.

Not sure which country you're in, but in the UK I only use localbitcoins. Just make sure that you're buying from one of the reputable sellers.

That's true for Bitcoin, it's a shame they don't flop their long dick out against things like burglary and car/bike theft though.

It was reasons just like this that made the UK vote for Brexit. But low and behold, it didn't take long for the conservatives to get their manifesto ready to take EVEN MORE POWERS.
The system is fucked.
