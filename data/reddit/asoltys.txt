lnd (the backend used by the lightning labs wallet) uses a custom mnemonic seed format that includes the "birthday" time of the wallet to allow the software to save time resyncing with the blockchain when importing the backup. Unfortunately it means that tools like the one you linked to can't parse it. I'm not sure if there's a way to import channel backups in the mobile app yet but if not that feature is likely coming soon and in the meantime here's some documentation on how to restore with lnd: [

HeadsUpGuys is a non-profit that helps men fight depression and prevent suicide.  According to WHO men account for 2-4 times the number of suicides.
My friend is the coordinator for the project, super nice guy who had his own problems with depression a few years back and now works to help other guys. They've created a great website resource that talks about depression in an honest and destigmatizing way specifically designed and aimed at men 18-45 years old. I know a lot of us probably fall within this range and I'm sure their resource could help serve many guys in the crypto community. 
The project was originally funded by the Movember Foundation but the starter grant they got will be running out soon. They've fundraised over $26,000 over the last year and are working to find more sustainable funding sources but basically need to double that to keep going for the rest of next year. I got him into bitcoin a couple months back and convinced him to add a btc address to their donation page. I just made the first donation and hope we can add more. The group is based out of and partnered with the University of British Columbia who provide office space and admin/finance support in kind (so donations go a lot farther and more directly to the project). For those not in a position to donate, check out the resource and let some people know about it:

You're correct that in a desert island situation where basic survival is a priority and the community is so small or desperate that trade isn't occurring or barter or some local currency is sufficient, Bitcoin won't be highly valued.  However, once your basic needs are met and you're looking for an instrument to facilitate trade in a global, hyper-connected, information-age civilization, you might start to value Bitcoin more because of its unique properties that make it a better currency for trade and commerce than, say, coconuts, or even gold.  This latter situation is the one many of us now find ourselves in.

Fair point but I did some research on this one.  The owner, Eric, has a pretty epic thread on the forums ( that you can use to get a sense of his operation and character.  He's been super transparent, helpful, and responsive so far.  But yeah I'm putting my trust in a third party which isn't always a great idea in bitcoin world but hopefully "this time it's different" (tm).  Anyways, my plan is to test it out for a few months now before I sink any more money in or recommend it to other people.

@_date: 2019-02-18 20:45:36
Not necessarily. Miners and hodlers could tighten up on the supply side too. In the process they'd *become* whales and the temptation to cash out would get stronger but if they continued to hodl steady and refuse to sell then you wouldn't need new capital coming in to see a significant price rise.
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:13:40
SHA256 is used for hashing, not encryption. It's used along with RIPEMD160 to derive addresses from public keys and in mining but the security of bitcoin wallets comes from ECDSA key pairs. Transactions need to be *signed* with a private key, not encrypted. Encryption can be used optionally to protect your private keys though in which case you might be using an algorithm like AES.

Yes it's possible.  If you enter an xpub... key it will use it to generate receiving addresses according to the BIP44 layout and you'll only see a balance in the wallet page with no withdraw mechanism.  You can also enter a BIP39 mnemonic and it'll detect that too.

Yes I generated it with vanitygen last year.  I did it offline and deleted the private key after importing it to blockchain but can't rule out that maybe a trace of it was left on the disk.  I sold that laptop to a friend of a friend a few months ago and formatted it but didn't completely zero the disk.
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:31:49
I checked the logs and didn't see any access to the account other than from my laptop half an hour before and then a couple hours after the transaction time.

No, I haven't heard back from blockchain.info or come to any sort of conclusion about how it happened yet although my phone being compromised seems to be the most likely possibility.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:56:36
Yeah unfortunately this wasn't an issue with change.  The coins were all sent to an address that I don't control.  I've run into the change issue before though when I formatted a computer with an electrum wallet on it that I had loaded a private key from blockchain.info into when blockchain.info was down one day.  The change got sent back to an address that electrum had created which I didn't have the private key for and I didn't realize it and formatted that computer that night.  Nearly lost $8000 worth of coins because of it but was able to grep the harddisk for the electrum wallet.  That was another hard lesson learned...
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:48:06
That's interesting.  1PcXspQbZWxUkS9bHcbgMUsb8HsUzP5noT isn't mine so I checked my email history to see if I could figure out who that might've been.  I think it was a young guy who found me on localbitcoins.com.  He forgot to bring an address for me to send to so I let him use my laptop to sign up for an account at blockchain.info that day.  He didn't strike me as suspicious or malicious at all -- he was an engineering student.  I'll check with him to see if his coins were stolen...

Related question:  What's the entropy/RNG source for bitaddress.org?  Is a javascript based address generator as good as the reference client?  I remember reading that rdrand() might have issues and truly paranoid folks should use the RNG that's used by FreeBSD or something like that.  Is it easy to "hand-craft" an address with your own randomn source like dice?

Yep the account was linked on my phone.  I'm thinking it must've been the weak link I'm just not sure how exactly.  I guess stores a copy of the wallet that's only encrypted with the second password so maybe someone was able to get ahold of it and brute force the second password since it was only 8 characters.  I was always a little sketched out by the android app but became complacent and started storing larger sums there after going so long without any issues.

You're quite right, dealing directly with strangers over the Internet is potentially risky business.  Systems like the bitcoin OTC web of trust database ( have been created to establish some indication of credit worthiness and trading history, but they're fallible and should be taken with a large grain of salt.  In the end, it's up to you to decide whether you're comfortable trading with someone or not.  I usually look at writing style and will sometimes ask people to add me on Facebook or link me to some website of their's that I can look at to verify the quality of their character.  And yes typically the person requesting the trade or the person with the less established credit profile would be expected to send first.  Anyways, sounds like you got your coins so I hope it was a good experience for you!  Feel free to contact me in the future if you're looking to buy more.

I just realized I was mistaken -- the transaction with him was the same day but 2 hours earlier for 4.9 BTC to 1LRm5njc43APa5AWSzcPsHfWmD1KeuZtjf.  I have no emails with anyone else that day to hint who 1PcXspQbZWxUkS9bHcbgMUsb8HsUzP5noT might belong to.  I find it interesting that there were coins moving back and forth to 1BcrUgDm96AsSYtHhXePqBhtSQRnR7FLCx and I'm trying to rack my brain to think of what that 1 BTC could have been for.  I'm starting to suspect that I must been testing out another client or something and had loaded my private key in there along with these other two addresses.  There seem to be a lot of 0.01 transactions which would make sense if I was sending test transactions and that's certainly something I've done in the past but nothing concrete is jumping to mind as to which client this might've been or what the situation was.  I'm wondering if someone got ahold of a wallet file from whatever client or service I was using and possibly brute forced it.  At the least this seems to exonerate blockchain.info and their Android app and gives me some peace of mind that I may not have any malware on my present laptop or phone.
