Well sorry, seen a lot of price related stuff here so didn't think it would hurt. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:17:22
They are moving it around. Should give some rise trouble. Although ive experienced our top price already 1200+ but it feels like all over again. 
I think is how having a baby feels like, you are happy at first but then the pain gets worse (price drop) but when its finally there you are happy again. So its just a tough pregnancy

Especially when you trade it, sold mine at 385. So +10% in my portfolio it is
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:37:22
Can't disagree with you. Although it was meant just as a funny contribution regarding dr Evil. I understand how it could be anoying and i will think twice before posting in r/bitcoin. I've been active on the smaller cryptocurrencie reddits so it kinda takes away the seriousness of a 8 billion dollar market we are trading in with bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:10:17
Yeah whats up with you guys. I feel like the sell rate has become much better lately! It was about -15€ per bitcoin less than actual rate and now its just about 1 or 2 euro. 
Great service, really. Have done 20+ transactions and no problems at all!

I probably own bitcoin longer than 80% of the people here, the joke was about it (nearly) being 1 million dollar and dr evil. As i stated already, dont comment the obvious people already sorta mentioned

Lets not open a discussion about what name we give this person or institution. Im just calling the name most people seem to have agreed on

Why does this remind me of the Bitcoin senate hearing which took bitcoin to 900$ ?
Always fun to watch

But the real question is, did you go to belltown, did you hit up already. Did he she let you know when they came home. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:10:39
I did not upvote nor downvote you. Its up to others how to handel questions and answers, i am biased. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:14:09
Your swiss franc argument is invalid. The swiss government let loose of the 1.20CHF per euro this morning letting it free and go wherever it was taken. It got worth more so the CHF was undervalued, it rose 20-25% against EVERY currency pair. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:09:29
There is never blood in the streets when bitcoin keeps getting traded and there is some significant volume. But yeah i think a marketcap of 1 billion is needed so that would mean 80 dollars?
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:16:54
If you are 19 and you have a net worth of 240000$ why buy in to bitcoin in the first place? It is not like you needed to make money

I have an additional question, im using multibit myself too on a computer i use not so often. But i want to check my balance now and then and i use it for orders. Which files should i delete so to my private key isn't on there anymore? 
Ofcourse i will overwrite the deleted files 3 times so that nobody can restore them again. 
Is it even possible to still use the program without my private key being openly on my pc? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:54:23

Well, fascinating, who made this drawing? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:24:44
But it isn't possible for someone to have the same address as you right? 
And if you have to enter a password for transfering money, does it really care someone may ever know my private key?
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:52:42
made me laugh +1
I meant i don't want to discuss the negative attention regarding china, people are still not done with the discussion if its positive or negative and enough posts have already discussed this. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:26:32
Reset the blockchain to before you transferred your bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:35:50
The most important factor would be time, but starting small building larger is how every company started, we just need a 'bitcoin only' marketplace. 
Working together with bitpay maybe? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:00:52
Since MTXNow shut down, all the users on there went to Cryptsy, the traffic was way to heavy for Cryptsy so deposit times took longer, now its getting faster but it still takes about half an hour to show up. 
A send bitcoin is never lost(unless you type in a wrong address but the chances typing a wrong existing address are small) , if it doesnt arrive it'll go back to your wallet, but seeing that you got 8 confirmations already, the bitcoin is going straight into your cryptsy account. 
Good luck trading.

Your sd card probably hasnt been wiped. Use a recover tool and let it run on your sd card. You have a huge chance you are able to recover it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:54:48
So why shouldn't we sell? Isn't this a huge dump for bitcoin, chinese financial institutions have a lot of money and we are going to miss them now. Big time
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:59:33
true, bit if i would have invested the amount i invested now in bitcoin in 2009, i would have gotten 1599 more bitcoins. 
And if i would have bought USD with Euro in 2009 i would have gotten 25% more USD 
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:53:37
Cryptsy mostly takes 7 or 8 confirmations, you'll be fine.

Why are banks still a thing? Deposits or transfers are expensive, the customer support is terrible, there have been reports of stolen money 1000s of times, the government traces you everywhere and if i want to pay my friend in australia he gets it a week or 2 later. 
I dont know, people just dont like change, they are like 'well, many people use it? It should be good?' 
I wouldn't choose Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange 
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:10:44
The chinese gov. is holding people back in their freedom, as always, yes they are allowed to buy bitcoins but they cant do anything with it. I think a protest on some scale should be held. As a bitcoiner we are united, and with growing power worldwide we could have more influence than the chinese gov. 
Worldwide bitcoiners shall unite, you should be free to pay with what you want, its your own risk the government should stay out of your choice

For the sake of good will, and 1 mBTC 
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:27:00
Ofcourse this is horrible, but you invested way more than you could in something really unstable.. 
You have till januari 15th, dont do stupid things, everythimg could happen to the bitcoin. Putting it in altcoins is an even bigger risk. I wouldn't cash now, i personally would wait a week and if it would get a bit higher, i would cash directly. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:50:05
For giving a signal that its usefull.. and because i need a tv?

Some people give 0.001 fee instead of 0.0001, you decide it for yourself. Miners take the transactions with the highest fee's first. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:12:45
Do you need the money? Yes? Dont invest
Dont you need the money atm or the next month? Invest
2000 dollars isn't that much in my opinion, but maybe you want to try the feel first, put in half for the next few days and when it feels good, put in the rest.
I'm not so fond of the thought about a new price drop.. the demand is very high... 
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:51:29
Sure it sucks that there was a price correction, but learn to hold, and if it doesn't rise again and stays at this price till the end of days, well too bad, shit happens, you'll survive. (unless you put ALL your money in it and have to sell your soul to the devil now, then you may not survive) 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:44:25

About my transfer, my btc just arrived, so i guess yours should arive too, the owners are knows openly, they cant just run with your money. Well they can but they'll get hunted down

My apologies, i'm fairly new to reddit
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:10:32
I actually think we are now around to bottom, anywhere around 700. What i clearly saw is that it when it goes down, the buy orders flow in like crazy. I think we will rise rise rise, maybe go down a 30 or 40 dollars but eventually every day a 5% rise

When you go to balances at the top, you can see any pending deposits for BTC, maybe its already there. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:24:05
I bought at 300, i went into my timemachine discovering they were only worth 30 cents! 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:26:15
It just got bought :) 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:47:23
That would be great, as for me im not looking for a real profit, sure would be nice, but i'm going to buy my new planned tv with Bitcoins.

i will transfer my 12 million BTC to there directly!

Sorry my crystal ball has his day off on thursday. 
My guess is you mean 1200 mtgox$, that'll need a day or 2
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:07:15
I hope cryptsy gives you 1 or even 5 for what you did. A negative balavce wouldn't have meant anything. You could've just created a new account.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:36:42
Say about holland what you want but our transactions regarding buying bitcoins are FAST. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:44:55
Answering to your retoric question, ofcourse!:) 
But the current situation of bitcoin is that the demand is dropping and the supply is rising, in my eyes its a positive feedback, meaning it will drop drop and drop. Unless we'll get some magically good news in the next few weeks
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:48:05
New users take up to 1.5x longer than trusted users. 
Every deposit i did to them wend through (last one being 7 hours ago) you should be fine. 
Dont forget to turn on the 2FA! 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:29:58
I had great experiences with cryptsy, 20 minutes ago i deposited 0,20 btc again. You should keep pushing the support, also contact BigVern on twitter. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:39:35
A friend of mine trades on mtgox, the trading is easy, only withdrawing is nearly impossible! But it seems that its easier with withdrawing large amounts 
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:17:28
Wow, i think its time for a new tv, i earned it! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:51:12
I hope you have a decent amount and are able to transfer it to a different bank who accept bitcoin, let them learn a lesson, they dont deserve your money
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:21:35
So did they really say it cannot and should nog be used as a payment method? Because some people got a different translation. 
I really should've taught myself some chinese at those restaurants

Does local bitcoins work for you? Or maybe you have a good friend in the western countries you can trust?(at own risk). 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:52:22
Most altcoins are just used to earn more btc, tried it for a week, made from 0.3 btc, 1.3 btc. 
Invested it in Megacoin, im expecting megacoin to rise to 10 dollars maybe 15 but it wont survive
Namecoin seems promising
