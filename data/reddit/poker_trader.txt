This is really helpful and clears up a lot for me. Any thoughts on the supposed money they raised through their Leo token?

I can relate man, it hurts to lose that much money.
In 2015 I won about 10btc playing poker on BTC poker sites over a period of about 6 months when BTC was worth around 1200$. After losing some longing BTC on the big crash down to 200$ I was pretty upset. That's when I discovered OkCoin 10 and 20x marging trading, where I proceeded to lose the rest. Losing my yearly poker profits on trading hurt so bad that I quit crypto for 2-3 years.
I'm not much of a hodler so I probably would have sold my BTC way before it mooned but I still wonder what fortunes I could have made just by being in crypto from that early on and taking the time to learn.
I'm finally back in crypto but Im much more conservative now and see even 10x margin trading as insane ��.

This is contingent on when you bought in though. Anyone who bought in last year will look like a genius. While people like me who bought in in January are getting rekt.

In Eastern Europe, China, India and Venezuela it's still possible to mine BTC profitably. Venezuela is by far the cheapest (~550$/btc), not that you'd want to set up shop there.

Actually the opposite of what you say is true. As the price drops then only the most efficient of miners remain leading to further/easier consolidation.
