@_date: 2018-01-18 15:56:19
they are in no position to enforce anything so i guess the most they can do is create a closed source bitcoin wallet connected with gov sql databases for linking identities to transactions. like modern phones that support obsolete tech like nfc for credit card payment, but a bitcoin wallet that requires nfc an id card to spend.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:20:26
with LN you won't need to open one channel for each person/entity you want to send payments. you just open ONE channel and then you can then send payment to ANYONE with a channel open without needing to open more direct channels with those people.
because *in lightning ��network�� payments ��are routed�� between�� opened channels.����*
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:53:06
they need to eat. that's why.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:40:07
we need lightning network exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:27:33
the first example yes, the second example nope. if the channel max capacity is 100 you can never have 150 in your balance for that channel. Capacity is the maximum number of coins you and your friend locked in the shared account (needed to open the channel).
If you locked 30 coins in the shared account and your friend locked 70, you and your friend will only be able to transact at most 100 coins for that channel. That means there's only 100 coins available for you and your friend to send and receive in LN via that channel. That limit also applies for any other routed payment you receive or send from anyone else in the network via that channel.
More examples. Channel cap. is 100 coins, your channel balance is 100. In sequence:






Your final balance is 0.
If you need to send or receive a payment of say 200 as I said before you (your wallet) will need to open a new channel with higher capacity. And you can have 2 , 4, 20 all the channels you want. Wallets will be able to handle multiple channels, so the total off chain wallet balance is the sum of what you've received via all your channels. But you can't share balance between channels yet.

"every time hhaappyyyy..."
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:13:31
AFAIK it does not depend in the amount but in the number of inputs  the transaction has because the nodes have to verify each signature that prove ownership of the coins. The same 5btc tx payment with 1 input is less costly to verify than a 5btc payment coming from 25 inputs.
It also depends on the input type. For example a multisingature type input will more costly because the node has to verify more signatures. But there are more types and you have to test / benchmark each case if you want more precision.
edit: transaction validation is a different cost other than mining a block, if you were thinking about that. miners have to do both.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:07:11
I read somewhere it may also be because they gain advantage if they use the time it takes to validate txs mining instead.

@_date: 2018-01-24 19:02:38
capacity determines the limit for spending or receiving within that channel overall. You could also open a new channel manually with bigger capacity and send the new higher amount to the same recipient. But hopefully the wallet will take care in the background of opening and closing channels and you will only have to order to the wallet 'Spend this amount offchain' and the wallet will act accordingly.
maybe a good characteristic for new LN wallets would be to let the user specify a % or fixed quantity of the total balance to be kept offchain.

@_date: 2018-01-24 11:01:02
that's right. just open a channel and pay anyone indirectly with an open channel. But the limit you can send or receive is the capacity of YOUR channel. that is for the first versions of LN. I believe with later  versions you could rebalance channels if you run out of money.
but what will happen is that once it's working everyone will start pouring most of the spending money into channels and keep the rest in cold storage outside of lightning in layer 1.
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:27:44
would it be a way to make tx commit to certain protocol rules? like spending exchange broadcasted utxos to an invalidating opcode that makes none of the user txs to be mined or included in mempool? in a uasf way.

if they were the only miner they would be DDoSing the network. but if they are doing it its because its profitable for them. why not require them to include some more tx to make the block valid? even if they try to spam the net and only choose their own txs they would be clearing the spam txs. and maybe they are spamming anyway, so...

first of all DO NOT SHARE the codes or words of your paper wallet with anyone offering help. I've never done it myself but I think some mobile wallets like Mycelium for Android lets swipe the paper wallets to the in app wallet. Then from your mycelium phone wallet send to yoir coinbsae account as usual.

the difficulty adjusts itself and the block size is restricted creating resource scarcity. they can also decide which tx fee to include in next block. if it's not profitable then switch off to dogecoin.

strange then


off topic but it will be very bad for bitcoin if coinbase partnered with facebook to use cheap bitcoin payments without leaving their centralized platform. Payments between cb accounts are free as they dont touch the blockchain. Millions of mainstream users will be experiencing bitcoin the wrong way via centralized entities (cb and fb) and with all the identities and txs tied together. even worst bitcoin txs are public. we really need lightning asap. coinbase is telling to us they are not interested in segwit or lightning.

everyone in the network will have to have an open channel to be part. just pay the fee for one special tx and from that point is the paradise of free fast transactions.
you can charge fees to others to allow routing through your node. and yes you could contract a specialized service that protects your money in the case your node crashes and you can't withdraw your money to the blockchain, but everything will be trustless.

@_date: 2018-01-24 10:46:52
it can be done that way op says but the first versions of Lightning Network won't allow changing the capacity of the channel, right?. That means that you will open a channel where you can only send and receive at most the price of the game you are buying, afaiu.
future development will allow channel rebalancng with more network layers or sending more funds to an existing channel but not yet i think.

the blockchain is what you call utxo snapshots and solves the double spending problem. the network is not synchronized because delays in propagation and other problems not every node knows all the relayed txs. the blockchain is exactly that, a log of what valid txs every synced node knows and it's called consensus.
without consensus you have to trust someone else to know the truth.

the vendor usually has a software interface for the hardware wallet that allows you to authorize txs wityout getting the private keys outside of the device. if you want to sell then yes, youll have to authorize a tx to send the coins to your exchange wallet.
in simple terms the wallet creates a payment request for the hardware wallet, then you'll need to click the device buttons or type a pin. Then the device sends the signed tx to the software wallet via USB and finally the tx gets broadcasted to the bitcoin network, and waits to get included in the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:54:37

awesome. i never get tired of watching lightning demos.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:55:27
I'm not the expert but I think you're confused. when a payment is routed and finished within the lightning network the funds unlock for every in-between node of the route and their funds became available again and the nodes can choose to settle the coins in layer 1 -the blockchain-  as store of value. 
if I understood correctly, one thing is **opening** a channel, which needs to lock coins between the two parties on layer 1 and other different thing is **routing** the payments of these two parties, where you don't need to lock the coins at all on layer 1 or give someone else advantage.
you can't force anyone to open a channel with you.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:47:45

oh you read it, cool! i read it some time ago now. that book really got me into this world. 
i see your point. i don't remember if pruned nodes still download and validate previous history and then discard it or just start asking from a certain point. currently i think nodes don't download the full blocks if they have already some of the txs in memory, to save bwidth, they only request the tx they are missing.
Regarding miners yes i meant 'trust that the rest of the nodes validating the chain are keeping the miners honest'.
i think there's also some spv lightning network wallets that download full blocks from certain point and only keep headers for prev. ones (most of the chain) , like Neutrino.

1/ Yes I think as with any normal tx if the tx is marked as Replace By Fee or the two parties just makes a Child Pay For Parent tx. Both are methods for increasing the confirmation priority of a tx.
2/ I think it may depend on the LN node implementation but you can read [here]( that the parties propose a fee until both agree on which is a fair one. I'm not sure if that happens for every commitment update.
3/ The maximum payment between two parties on a LN channel is the channel capacity, but a new paper that proposes Lightning Factories comes with a way of rebalancing the channels off chain by adding a new layer between lightning network and the blockchain. Under that scheme LN would be layer 3 and factories layer 2.
4/ I can't wait to have that wallet when it cames out :) but more likely that stuff will happen transparent to the user. You won't have to bother about rebalancing, the wallet will open/close/rebalance and convert btw different coins and etc. off chain automatically. Can't wait.
5/ You can read the code and the documentation for the developing implementations. Above I linked lnd but there are many, but I don't have the links handy now for tests.

bitcoins are created out of nowhere via the process of mining. the first bitcoins were mined by Satoshi I think. blocks always contain at least one transaction which pays the mining reward to the miner that found the block.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:39:36
you won't need to open a channel with anyone you want to transact with off chain. Just by having a channel open in the Lightning Network with someone, and if the other person has a channel as well you can send money. 
That's because payments are routed between opened channels. So you can have a channel opened with your boss and just that channel. You can then get paid by your boss via that channel and then go to grocery store and buy without opening another channel with them. it's magic! :)

Andreas in some of his videos said that to him LN fee collection looked like a POS system but it's not a real POS coin. LN does not allow you to extend the layer 1 blockchain just by stacking LN fees, if i understood correctly.

@_date: 2017-12-02 19:00:10
wow you can't explain the whole (dead) scaling debate in a single comment. do more research but here's a tldr for lightning network.
- blocks of txs are restricted to 1MB for security,
- blockchains don't scale because of that (can't handle Visa level throughput),
- solution 1 increase block size limit recklessly and destroy bitcoin
- solution 2 use payments outside the blockchain with same security (payment channels) known as Lightning Network. 
- LN means near zero tx fees and instant payment confirmation.
- LN still in development.

users would have to check xpubs manually, but just once. 
with addresses alone attackers have all the time they want to hack the server, whereas with xpub they do just until users verify manually.
yes I agree its a privacy disaster.
if you don't like xpubs maybe stealth addresses will serve a more private purpose? I think other privacy coins use it by default.

blame Coinbase and Blockchain.info that haven't implemented Segwit yet (available since 2015). but fees are meant to be high to reward miners. I personally don't care paying 40$ fee to make / settle 200 billion 2nd layer txs. The idea is pay once 40$ to open one channel and never ever touch the blockchain unles something went very wrong.
that means, when lightning is ready and layer 1 fees are low, open as many channels as you can!!!!1

yes all of that, its current price seems to be mostly the fruit of speculation. that doesn't mean it's not a revolution or that adoption is not increasing. to me bitcoin will always be valued something because it started from 0 from the community, that means there will always be someone that gives it value for its properties, not its price.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:44:43
Every non Segwit transaction that coinbase makes is not using the restricted block size efficiently, pushing fees higher for the rest of us. One benefit from Segwit it that even those that don't use it will as well benefit from lower fees. At least they should behave like a good player in the ecosystem, even more after their complaints about high fees during previous political arguments. 
One more thing, withdrawal fees is also another difficulty for their users in order to get their money out of Coinbase, since having your wallet there involves 3rd party risk. High fees certainly benefits them since every internal transaction inside Coinbase doesn't pay a fee, sticking users to their centralized platform. But guess what, Coinbase internals is not Bitcoin.

It's not by default. I don't know about Electrum desktop, but for Electrum Android app you need to install and start first **Orbot** app and then open Electrum wallet and go to **Network &gt; Proxy** and set:

i think that's called a pruned blockchain with a spv wallet, right?. but only with block headers you have to trust miners. that's why everyone needs to validate everything. or you have to trust that someone validated theprevious history. the question is who you'll trust?

block crypto network traffic as China does with Tor. 
ban exchanges.
collude with chip manuf. monopoly to put hardware backdoors on all computers. 
regulate chip imports.
create national mobile payment substitute (like wechat).
to kill bitcoin these things should be done everwhere which is unfeasible. bitcoin can't survive in a world with no neutrality. but it could be weakened until it is not damaging to them.

yes bitcoin use nowadays is as a very vollatile store of value. you call it a bubble but that's not necessarily negative, let's see who survives this bubble, as some internet companies did, if it actually is a bubble. Regular people invest because they believe in its long term value, they use it now is as a store of value not as a currency, I agree on that but that may change.
Of course there are lots of clones of the bitcoin protocol, but none of them have the excellent technical team Bitcoin has, if not the best engineers in the world, and they are working to give Bitcoin the properties of a currency (the upcoming Lightning Network). So when people invest long term, they are also investing in the team, community, network effect and future prospects.
And there will always be someone who gives it value because they made a philosophical investment, not a speculative one.
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:48:33


I think not. The protocol rules live outside the blockchain and are executed by the full nodes. Maybe youre confusing Script with protocol rules? Because protocol defines how the smart contract executes.

no, not requiring but taking that path to save money. I didnt mention adding any change in the bitcoin core code.
Miners could offer private ways of receiving transactions, and those who dont would see less transactions, less fees.
Finally your last point, the miner could send a protocol message to the wallet, like an electrum protocol to alert the user of confirmation status. 
Miners could keep collecting txs the traditional way, and some users can choose to support small miners by sending txs directly to them. Like crowdfunding small (local?) mining with bitcoin user transaction fees.
I dont see any rational objection against saving money that way, since bitcoin mining is centralizing anyway and theres no solution to that being actively worked on that I know about.
Also wouldnt that put more power in the hands of the users actually using bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:53:42

@_date: 2018-09-30 13:11:20
it's different with bitcoin. with reddit, google, twitter, etc govs just need to knock on 3-4 doors to get things banned. if they want to ban bitcoin from the inside they need to compete against the rest of the miners in computer power. and even if they get to have that much power bitcoin users will just update their full nodes to circumvent those bad miners. so it's a lost cause from the begining.
what they can do however is ban bitcoin internet traffic, but if your gov gets to that point you have far bigger problems other than criticizing this magic money. that would only apply to their country.

if going mainstream means convincing most people to switch their political view then bitcoin will never go mainstream.

why would companies provide canaries if that would mean losing users/money when they get busted? even more when it's about users money as in bitcoin apps. maybe they don't have the incentive? it has to be dev group committed to some ideology... which I don't like or trust. I prefer an open source, well reviewed project.
but seriously. only companies needing to do that would be exchanges. but we all know they must do KYC so a canary is pretty pointless. if you need canaries for wallets then you shouldnt' be using those wallets or you are doing bitcoin wrong.
any other app, why would you need canaries when the blockchain is public?

you don't actually need to paste a node uri. All you wrote can be resumed in: 'I got some coins, opened a channel and waited for confirmations, then scanned payment qr code and press send'. And you don't need to open a channel with everyone, just one.
with LN you make one on chain tx as usual and when confirmed you can make infinite free instant txs to whoever you want.

if your bitcoin node is on another computer the program you need is called an SSH client.
if the node is in your own computer you just use the terminal of your operating system to run bicoin commands.
**same computer:**
if unfortunately you are using windows press Windows key + R and enter 'cmd' in the box (if it keeps working that way).
on linux search for 'terminal' on the distro menu.
**another computer:**
as I said you need an ssh client.
windows. download Putty and follow this thing I've found 
for linux you don't need to install anything as it ships with a client by default. just open a terminal and enter 
    ssh &lt;replace with user&gt; with node ip&gt;
 and enter the password when asked.
if your node is in your home network assign it a static IP. if it's in a remote VPS login to your dashboard and find the 'public IP' and credentials.

lost coins only make the commodity more scarce increasing the value of remaining coins. mining subsidies will end and miners will start depending only on the fee market to get their income. fees will naturally increase but we'll have extra cheap and fast 2nd layer payments way earlier.
another good thing that's derived from that is empty blocks and spam will reduce when block rewards approaches zero.

the bitcoin game theory against a 51% attack does not depend on the hashrate the network has.
a drop in hashpower means miners stop mining. a 51% attack means miners start mining *again* and start attacking the network. 
51% means you can censor txs, you rewrite all the recent history you want and get all block rewards. the thing is it's easier to get the rewards by competing on the same **rules** everyone follows than opposing them. or else you'll create the risk of forking and loose *all* your rewards.. even if one pool gets 100% of all hashrate they will do better following the rules. and who dictates the rules? I answer myself: the full nodes.

when I said I'm a blockchain expert and influencer I was 100% joking xD. 'Blockchain influencer' equals clown to me. I'm learning some things from this thread :)
The nodes generate independently the UTXO set from the blockchain that they download from other nodes.
This UTXO set is created from all the txs from all blocks. Validating each output being spent for every input back to all coinbase transactions. assumevalid option can be used to fast validation, but I think it's used for historic data only.
When a new transaction arrives to the mempool the node verifies it before broadcasting it. They check if the inputs spends UTXOs, and other validations.
It doesn't matter how many inputs a tx have, everything tracks down to coinbase, amounts check too. If you say it does not please provide some source.

awesome. there's so many things to improve in ui on avg bitcoin wallets. all things related to payment logic internals should be hidden from the user. blocks, network, confirmations, addresses, channels, autopilot, privacy, proxy, tx id, nodes, etc all out. these concepts should be translated to what the user expects from a payment. there should not be an option for switching to lightning payment. if it brings the best experience LN should be used by default. if it is still in beta, it should not be used. more complexity should be shown only upon explicit request from the user.
the user should only see 'receive a payment' and 'send a payment' and a transaction history. and on top of that you can build nice services like balance management, phone refill, multisig, coin exchange, privacy, etc.
the most straightforward way would be to pick a banking app from the mobile stores and mimic the interface.

bitcoin addresses are hashes of public keys. when you share a bitcoin address you are not exposing neither your public key or your private key so don't worry for that. But when you spend bitcoins to someone else's address (when you scan a qr code) you are exposing the corresponding public key where your bitcoins are allocated.
Public keys are meant to be made public and currently they are believed to be secure. so with today's knowledge you can *feel* safe that your private keys will not be derived from the public ones, but we don't know if that holds for the future , for example when quantum computers begins to become available.
Also for better privacy all wallets create new addresses every time you receive a payment (creating new private/public keys).
In conclusion always regenerate keys to receive payments for security and privacy but your wallet will do it for you :) :)
with your seed backup you can regenerate a whole wallet with all private/public keys and the corresponding addresses. Even if one of your private keys leaks the rest will remain secure, but if someone gets to know the seed words i'd recommend to move your coins to another seed/wallet.

the dude provided signatures that did not verify on all wallets. and later on he transferred the original prize to another address to make it easier, he said, but the puzzle remained the same afaict (kinda weird imo).
but as someone said, there's no way to prove the puzzle is not fake even if they proved ownership of the prize (unless you solve it obv.).
they were also selling the same puzzle art at an overrated price, so they were obv. deriving a lot of value from the 'puzzle' challenge.

I was not questioning your mental abilities, I was addressing the hypothetical subject in those scenarios you describe eg:

Money is not yours just because you happen to have control over it. Same case as finding money on the street. Due to the lack of blockhain police just move it aside and report it to the online community.
In the donation case I mentioned above, my ethical education won't let me to spend any of the money in that wallet, because I wouldn't know if the money is mine (unless I have confirmation from the donor).

The users transacting on bitcoin and that validate their own transactions with their own full node decide what is bitcoin.
Imagine exchanges and big retail forked away and started advertising their fork as "the real Bitcoin". All the users using and running full nodes (where the value really is) will reject all their economic activity.
The same way, if you want to displace facebook as main social media you need to force all the users to another platform. But facebook is centralized. Imagine trying to do that with bitcoin.
because business at the end have to serve users. If the users want to use bitcoin they can check their own activity with the other party and detect fraud in a decentralized way. so it's not easy to trick them into using a fork.

all the transactions are chained. your node must verify all the output scripts, no matter they are spent or unspent, and verify all the way back to the coinbase. somewhere there must be a full node with all history serving the network. 
after you verify everything **then** you can prune. but you won't be able to serve your pruned records (obv).
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:13:49
yes nodes store all UTXO set without any limit. Some wallets use bloom filters to get only the transactions they are interested in with some sort of privacy (tho it's failed privacy). The node serving that wallet I think it has to have txindex option enabled.
Some new wallets in development like Neutrino will ask for full blocks to the nodes, so it's more private. so I assume no txindex is required.
Ask an expert for this one but AFAIK the merkle tree of transactions serves to commit the transactions to the hashpower that created that block, securing them. It's also an efficient way of verifing a tx was commited to that block.
I don't think theres a merkle tree for utxos, but I do think that bitcoin core uses some sort of cache to accelerate access to that data. so the utxo set is already proved to be commited to the hashpower with the tx merkle root.

oh here we go
selfish mining paper 
i believe the paper on fees was this  but I'm not sure.
if I understand, selfish mining is an attack on other miners revenue. big miners will maintain it's advantage (valid blocks) private in a private branch until they detect they will lose their advantage (when the public branch starts catching up). Then selfish miner releases their private chain and reorgs the public chain and collects all the rewards. 
Until the private chain is published, honest miners are wasting resources mining on invalid blocks, because they didn't know about the valid private chain.
I don't know if this was addressed by devs at some point or if it's not really a big deal after all. It's more about all miners having a fair share for their efforts than changing the bitcoin rules. no matter what chain wins it has to pass the validation of full nodes.
I don't understand the other paper.

no, if the bitcoin economy grows into LN it would be very different than if it grows into bakkt. 
with bakkt you will be locking bitcoin's economy in Microsoft cloud servers. It's the Coinbase equivalent that wants to replace LN.
some say it's good for the price because more merchants will be able to accept bitcoins, but think that if bitcoin is valuable it's because of decentralization. if you are using microsoft cloud to burn bitcoins into fiat what's the point?
it has to be the other way around, a LN wallet that burns fiat into bitcoins.

his point is not 'we should ban these people from bitcoin'. I think he means most people only cares about those institutions surrounding bitcoin for the implications on the fiat rate, and they forgot or never knew about why it is a revolution we need.

@_date: 2018-05-30 13:59:18
thing is people price goods and services in bitcoin according to the price conversion to fiat and not based on a crypto market because, if I understand correctly, most govs don't accept taxes directly in crypto. and that rate can be manipulated imo, so people can't expect to have same fiat purchasing power.
the only way would be to directly create a market for food to crypto for example, and count how much food you can buy with bitcoin, instead of how much fiat you can get with bitcoin. openbazaar may be an option imo. otherwise we are depending on institutional adoption for the price to stabilize imo.
I think when people here speak about crypto adoption they mean less dependency about the fiat rate. my understanding is very simplistic though.

I may be wrong, do your own research and try my advice at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any fund loss.
ok, make sure you have your seed backup. then reinstall electrum wallet and restore the wallet with the seed. it wont ask password.
If the wallet keeps asking you for a password it may be reading the wallet file it created before. Search what is the default folder where electrum saves wallets and delete the wallet file you forgot the password. you can delete it securely if you have the seed backup for that wallet.
check electrum docs for default wallet paths:
I'm not sure but by deleting the wallet files maybe you will loss some transaction data, like transaction descriptions that you may have added manually. But all the funds and history will be recovered.

as Jesus once said: 




coin mixing is the new garnment. bitcoin the old, not private. some privacy altcoins are doing excellent, my brothers and sisters.
the coins spent from a mixing transaction if not anonymized will render the mixing useless. if an exchange can detect and ban a mixing transaction, then again what's the point. other coins add privacy by default all the time. that's why some exchanges are running like crazy into banning privacy coins because they cant ban it partially.
also you have like a whole set of blockchain analysis data from before the mixing event, and from after the mixing event.
(I'm editing a lot, sorry) also all the privacy tech should always say to the users that by its own is not a guarantee that you will not be deanonymized. it also requires you to change all your behaviour.

as Andreas says if they own the coins they are the economic majority that can impact the future of network upgrades. the users control bitcoin because they run their own full nodes and they transact/own their coins. if you put your bitcoins in a custodian online wallet, or any wallet where you don't control your private keys, you are giving them your right as bitcoin user to decide bitcoin rules. and they use to be regulated by govs that would prefer bitcoin to disappear.
the best thing you can do is run your own full node at your home and use it.
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:09:08
ye, but you know why, at least the coins are in my pocket and I take care of them independently. that's the soul of bitcoin. financial freedom. and you can have strong security with just multisig, store each paper passphrase in different locations or memorized, much better than giving your coins to someone else and that's for sure much better security than people care today having fiat cash in their pockets.

transaction you change your public receiving address that is different.
each new address has a different new private key. when your wallet creates a transaction a new private key is generated. You only see and share the derived address.


to spend bitcoins your transaction must expose a public key that would be vulnerable to a quantum attack when that machine becomes available (a lot of years in the future). 
That public key would only be vulnerable during the time it remains in the pool of unconfirmed transactions. When the transaction confirms into the blockchain then even if a quantum pc grabs it and breaks it it does not matter because those bitcoins are already spent to a new address (the public key of which it was derived is not yet exposed). 
If some Bitcoins are sent again to that address whose pub key is already exposed, even confirmed in the blockchain, the funds would not be secured under a quantum attack. That's why wallets do not reuse addresses.

in bitcoin the private key is not the money itself but the means of claiming ownership of it, same as a password for an account.
if you brute force seeds without consent and make someone else lose money then I'd think you may face some trouble. I think the same applies as password cracking. I mean it wouldn't seem ethical to me.
Not legal advice, just my common sense.

you start learning basic information security. you'll have to know how to secure the devices you'll be transacting with. For example, you can't have security if you use Windows operating system, you have to move to something more secure. Also when you communicate with people you have to avoid services that may be compromised (most mainstream ones).
Then learn what risks you'll be facing when getting into crypto. Market value can be wiped in 24h and you have to be prepared for that. One common advice is to only put money you wont need any time soon for your survival.

ye, problem is your coins on coinbase or any other web wallet is that they control the ownership of your coins no matter the amount. Also a honeypot for hackers.
Electrum is a very functional wallet ( only runs on your pc and you control the private keys for sending coins. Don't forget to write down the seed and keep it safe! Choose a strong password for encrypting the wallet! If you mess up I'm not responsible, do your own research.
Electrum also supports Tor, for better privacy. Also supports hardware wallets.

another problem is if theres a virus in your device that changes your address to a valid one and the user doesnt check. in that case the tx wont fail, so always check. You can check first and last 6 characters of the address. First characters can be customized but not the last ones.

nodes need to verify and serve to other nodes the whole history so they can verify the chain of ownership to generate the UTXO set by themselves, since the block the coins were mined.

that is useless advice. 'Don't use airplanes if you don't understand how they work'. You can review the code, if you don't understand it know that it is open to the community of developers to review it and there's interest from businesses that depend on bitcoin to dedicate brain power from their workforce to contribute directly to bitcoin's source code. You have to trust the community review process and the fact that bitcoin was not hacked ever. Every change is well reviewed and advertised to the community.

If I understand in the future versions of lightning when lightning factories are ready users will join to create a mega transaction to open multiple channels at once. 
They will pay the fee together, like paying $50 fee between 300 participants will be cheap. And from that point they won't need to touch the blockchain to close and open more channels. 
I'm worried more for the miners income other than the fees users must pay, because no one will be using on chain tx to transact at some point, if lightning becomes very efficient.
maybe issuing new inflationary tokens that could only be spent by miners along normal capped bitcoins supply?

before I used 'crypto internet market' term but I think it has not to be that broad to begin. it may begin with fiat rate independent small local markets. but who knows. maybe it's a fool thought but at the very end bitcoin really is controlled by its users and whatever utility they believe it has.

it's a transitioning period. not only taxes but you may also need to replenish stock and your providers only accept fiat. it's the whole economy that needs to move. 
imo it starts from people's demand, leading to merchant demand, leading to providers accepting bitcoin. then govs regulating accordingly. then banks buying bitcoin reserves, then countries transacting oil and gold for bitcoins between them. but that's a crypto dream and my understanding is very simplistic.


that's what I meant. you don't need fiat per se other that for your tax obligations for example and other interactions with current system.

Bitcoin has value because it is scarce (only 21 million bitcoins will be generated) and people want it.
But it is also actually useful because Bitcoin is not only like a yellow heavy rock like gold standing there, it also is a payment network that you can use to send money to any place in the world with Internet connection near instantly, and soon 100% instantly.
Bitcoin is also useful to overthrow the current traditional financial system, and that's also valuable (or at least have an alternative).
You can watch Andreas Antonopoulos talks on youtube. He is awesome.
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:23:38
Bitcoin is not only an alternative to the convenience of the existing payment networks. it's an alternative to the trusted abusive middleman vulnerable to politics and mismanagement. It's the difference between owning your money and not.
These demos are beautiful because they are demonstrating that we can have a fair alternative that performs better than the traditional one and that is controlled collectively by its users. The system is still experimental but it keeps working.

I have no experience with your exact issue but if you have any funds in your account what I would do is wait for your account / IP to be whitelisted to do the password reset procedure.
Use a password manager (keepass) + 2FA + do incremental backups on the cloud just in case you can restore a previous backup if your database file gets corrupted because of a disk write error (I recommend mega.nz for that matter, no shilling tho, they really awesome :) + back it up as well in an external drive and keep that offline copy updated.
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:50:33

enable rbf with electrum wallet, and when the thief goes away, replace it with higer fees. IN YOUR FACE!!! 
edit: emphasis.
@_date: 2017-02-20 10:25:07
Opt-in Replace By Fee is a way to check your transactions as non-final. That lets you replace your transactions (before they are confirmed) with higher fees (and following other criteria).
With this enabled by default (you'll need a compatible wallet), for example, when the thief runs away, if you already have your phone, create another replacing transaction to another address of your own.
Electrum wallet is compatible with RBF (android app too).
Of course the thief may know that and disable rbf before sneding txs, it would be great for wallet developers to add a secure mode to prevent this (for example, according to location, encrypt wallet).
hope it helps!! to da mooon!!
@_date: 2017-02-18 10:41:10

it wouldn't be implemented mainstream that way. segwit will do that and that's their biggest fear.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:20:47
I think the better would be to go the middle way: adopt segwit along with some dynamic hardcoded blocksize, like Monero system does.

IMHO, miners are already attacking the network by mining empty blocks. That creates congestion in the network since txs are not getting included in blocks, and that increases the required fees. That means miners can create demand by DoSing transactions at will.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:56:04
haha! you're funny.
@_date: 2017-03-30 08:08:53

omg. totally busted.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:57:34
one thing is to filter tx by fee and another very different is to exclude all transactions from a block.
@_date: 2017-03-30 08:15:36
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:48:38
then core devs would adapt the pow algo, and then mr Wu ambitions would go down the toilet even if the attack is not successful.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:54:57
It's expected by design that miners sometime will start living on fees as blockreward dissapear. But there's a problem... miners can start only including their own transactions on blocks... to get again all the reward and the fees. so maybe it's not viable... :(
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:30:17
looking forward to the final release. super exciting!
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:39:50
totally. They prefer to risk with a hardfork rather than try first with a safer softfork.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:33:13
Satoshi wanted a democratic coin, not a greedy coin managed only by greedy miners. Satoshi called this a 51% attack, not democratic will. The democratic decision is not the hashrate, but the decisions of the users to use the network.
Please re-read the paper and prepare to mine a blockchain with no transactions (besides coinbase ones).
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:38:16
less fees for miners - less profit - less miners - more mining centralization

@_date: 2018-10-20 06:09:22
agree. I was wondering if current version notation is well suited to a project like bitcoin. because if they use semver, major version bumps would mean incompatible api changes. would that mean a hard fork in the case of bitcoin? I don't know. 
I wonder if they could invent some sort of 'consensus versioning' for releases. that would help a lot to categorize wallets for example.

the true spirit of bitcoin. coinbase is validating your transactions for you if you use them. you have to trust them.
running and using your own full node to validate your transactions means really controlling your own money.
@_date: 2018-10-20 06:16:09
if you paid people they would start spanning millions of AWS nodes or the cheapest VPS to get the most from the reward.
And nodes that are not being used with a wallet to validate txs are not that useful.

@_date: 2018-10-09 14:24:43
well in lightning some transactions are private. maybe something can be worked out from that. 
or maybe we can reduce bitcoin supply/block reward with a soft fork so fee incentive kicks in? anyways, 21 million was an arbitrary number right? like miners are not to regulate fee market with empty blocks. no one elected them to do that.

translated to bitcoin: the decision to be made is the order of the transactions in time. or said in another way we need to know who owns what coin up to the present to allow their fair use. bitcoin achieves that by requiring a costly computing operation. if you want to undo a transaction you need to redo the costly computations. bitcoin trusts that the valid chain with the most computer work has the correct order of records. 
the miners provide the computer power and the full nodes force miners to create valid blocks.
that design is vulnerable to a 51% attack, in which the miners starts to undo the transaction order (they can't steal other people's money unless you transacted with them), or censor transactions, while still following the rules according to full nodes. but it is highly noticeable and miners know that if they do that, bitcoin users will change the proof of work algorithm and all their machines will be rendered worthless, so they lose a lot of money. 
that's why they do not attack, because they gain more by following the rules.

Yes. you can initialize and sync the wallet. Lightning wallets will extend legacy ones, so you can expect it does the function of a normal wallet too.
But you'll need to confirm a transaction in the blockchain to open a channel. Without channels your lightning wallet does nothing.


Yes, if you have enough lightning balance. You will be able to open channels with exchanges if you want, but it's not necessary. You can send fund through lightning without having a direct channel with whom you're paying.


opening a channel is just sending a normal bitcoin transaction, so on chain fees apply here as well.

ViaBTC (owned by Bitmain) has broken the agreement by forking the network with BCash (or Bitcoin Cash) to biggest blocks before Segwit activated. Currently Segwit is pending activation approx 23 Aug 2017.
Also they created a split, which was not the intention. now they'll be 2 forks intead of one, the outlined in the agreement:

exactly, exactly the things you should NOT buy from someone at the street. you nailed it dude.
you have to sync your own full nodes by yourself, or else you are trusting someone else. you have to buy each and all hardware wallets directly from the vendor to avoid hardware manipulation. 
and for fucks sake do not buy preloaded paper wallets because the person selling them can know the private keys, and empty the paper wallet after you buy it. you should install a non custodial wallet and send bitcoins directly to it and not tell anyone your private keys.

I switched to Linux a loong time ago and I am very happy with my setup. I no longer use that three-letter agency massive surveillance backdoored slow piece of shit operating system Microsoft Windows is.
Even if it was not deleting users files you should switch as making bitcoin or any financial transactions on Windows is insecure. Why? because between many things it has a keylogger that records all your passwords and private keys from your clipboard:
So move away to a noob friendly Linux desktop like Ubuntu.
you won't need to know hacking things to switch. very graphical and easy and you will find tools already installed.
As for the other incompatible Windows tools that won't work on Linux you can set up a Windows virtual machine inside your Linux and run your programs there, isolated from your crypto transactions. That's very easy to do as well, for example with VirtualBox.

@_date: 2017-08-21 14:39:05
As someone pointed out, Bitcoin needs scaling but at the same time preserving the decentralization, and that is not achieved through simply increasing the block size, because Bitcoin still has much room to grow. The main problem is that we can't let users demand to centralize Bitcoin by just increase the block size. The best alternative is to route the payment on second layers as Lightning Network will do soon, scaling to millions of more users. That's the best we have right now without centralization risks.
The 2X part of Segwit2X aims to follow the increase big blocks arbitrarily, just by miners and some business that don't ask their users will.

this. we can't avoid it. I was thinking of a scenario where institutions start piling up peoples bicoins as with current rules, but when bitcoin goes private in a serious way like monero, and regulation changes because of that, those institutions may not be willing to return the funds or give more complications or make political pressure to devs to revert privacy and press users with their own money. scary things.
they could drive away from full nodes most of the economic activity, through political pressure derived from coin retention derived from regulation changes derived from protocol changes.

It's not just mining an altcoin but hopping between coins being one coin their own fork. This gives the hoppers advantage over the continuous miners. it's a known attack, applied chains it's called coin hopping, applied to pools, ... pool hoping...
just fork, pump, attract miners (over 40% of mining at times switched to bcash(!)) I think that way you'd have more room for a 51% attack on the original chain. they can use patented asicboost on the other chain, they control pools and devs, etc.

I didn't say you are my servant: your excuse to close the source is scammy clones, but at the official Coinomi webpage it stills says Coinomi wallet is open source. That's shady and scammy. Having an outdated open source version does not make your wallet open source.
Do not take this personally, I don't even know who you are and I don't care at all. I just know my money is hosted in your wallet and at this point I don't know if the closed source binary distributed through the app stores have the ability to steal my keys.

with bitcoin you don't need banks or id verification or paypal, or visa, masterturd, etc.
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:10:59
because there's a maximum amount of transactions that can be validated per second.
each block of the blockchain has to be filled with transactions and these blocks have a size limit, to protect bitcoin from a DOS attack.
so, if many people want their transactions included in the next block they need to compete, like an auction, for the block space, by paying miners more or less fees according to the fee market.
it is meant to be expensive because there will never be enough space if everyone makes transactions in the blockchain, because as long as you have the money for the fees you can make as much transactions as you want.
with that said, there's new protocol layers being built on top of the bitcoin blockchain that will let you make instant (no confirmation wait) decentralized and almost free transactions, with no blocksize limit, and more transaction throughput than visa, mastercard and paypal together. it's called the lightning network.
in the lightning network fees are almost symbolic since it seems unlikely someone will be able to make a living from lightning fees, unless you allow for unusual (big) transactions (lightning is meant for micropayments).
in lightning theres no blocksize limit, but the limits are your bandwidth (how many transaction data you can send) your money (max send/receive balance in your payment channels) and the network liquidity (how many available routes exist for your payment) AFAIK.

Bitcoin XT, Bitcon Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, etc... they were all attempts to overtake the original BItcoin to add bigger blocks. ALL of them failed. They are proposing the exact same thing with the 2X part of 'their' agreement, Segwit2X. It will fail like before because the community won't accept it because there's centralization concerns. We have seen that before. And a centralized currency is business as usual. use dollars instead.
What they can do is split (like they did with Bitcoin Cash) but they can't overtake the original Bitcoin chain. You will see scams like the ViaBTC ones, offering BIP148 Bitcoins, and other shit. They are just using the name' Bitcoin' but they aren't.

any part of the system can choose to change the code they run, or to wich rules to mine and split them off the original network at any time. By design.
But what they can't do is to force their new rules on anybody else, because there's no centralized authority. so you can fork away but not force your ruleson anyone. and that's cool :)

OP talks about fee price reduction not tx size alone, it depends on many things imo. Segwit doubled the block size on average,  maybe increasing tx size doesn't do much of a fee increase than it was before? assuming fees will inevitably be expensive onchain and lightning is around the corner, maybe range proofs and bulletproof optimization are something to consider for bitcoin?

DOS in this case means too big blocksizes make network nodes resources to be spent too quick to keep up with transaction validation.
nodes have a limited amount of hard disk, computing power etc.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:07:02
Empty blocks are because there's still 12.5 BTC as mining reward. When the incentives starts dependeing more on the tx fees empty blocks would start becoming rare. But right now I can't see a way of disincentivize that. If the code puts a minimum limit to block size then it'd be filled with spam txs, and miners would collect their own fees so no loss for them (there's a risk though if you don't control high % of hash rate (more to worry about oscillating hash rate...), otherwise competing miners would collect your fees, that system would work if we had more decentralized mining, in my inexpert opinion).

51% attack means the miner can decide to not include some transactions in a block. Also means the miner attacking can double spend their coins, but they cannot steal the rest of the bitcoins.
they can also reorg the chain as far as they want.
all this is solved by updating the full nodes. maybe a pow change or making fast rolling releases with checkpoints?

Lightning Network security is the same as of on-chain Bitcoin transactions. No one can steal your funds, even if they were big centralized hubs. also no one can stop you from opening a channel for unlimited payments because anyone can start a lightning hub to create another routes. You can also use Tor for opening channels and I think it will be built in by default, not sure tho.

They were cautious even with the Segwit capacity increase, but they decided the risk was worth taking. afaik they are not opposed to a hard fork, maybe to a block size increase, but they oppose doing it the wrong, fast risky way.

first: if there's a legal way of stopping the attack, better. Anyone, not only a Core member could take legal action.
second: they are fucking fighting for Bitcoin (our fucking money) by any means. At least be greateful. They don't 'own' Bitcoin as a system. Or you don't know how all of this works.
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:25:09


lol nope. you lock your funds voluntarily. opening the channel will require sending funds to a multisig address, but only after getting a commitment escape option.

without the uncertainty of forks Bitcoin could be worth more that 5K.
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:25:08
there's no way to steal funds. maybe if you run old node sofware (or worse an spv) you can be tricked temporarly.
the second address was spend in 
see the script sig is a multisig one (the last one), so no segwit address. the other address has nothing spent yet. you can also watch the block to confirm that.

asics mean more security because they can do more computation. some experts think that miners are achieving the physics limits for computing power and that from that point there will be a wider distribution of equipment that will last longer for mining operations with benefits, which will make mining more decentralized. plus new firmware is being deployed that will normalize hardware optimizations (overt asicboost) so more miners can benefit from that.
so if i understand mining is centralized right now because those companies got in first, but when they hit the physics limits, everybody will get in.

Miners can also choose which is the valid chain for them and fork off. Anyone can do that at any moment, with more or less (market) success. See Bcash.

slow down cowboy. you're gonna burn your keyboard. volume must come after security, not the other way around.
bitmain 'centralization issue' is real I concede, but we can kick them in the ass at any moment, as other coins already have done, as soon as they start to misbehave.
all those coins that say they will scale will be overridden by the lightning network and other improvements on bitcoin, because bitcoin already has security and builds on that.

they are not taking the most important thing, and that is the users. as someone said very clearly, even with 100% hash power means nothing if the users who are using the currency reject your blocks. it doesnt care if you bribe the economic business that never got their users' agreement on signing any agreement.
'Bitcoin' is just marketing. you need to dive a bit more deeply in it if you are serious.
All what they can do is split, put 'Bitcoin' in front of their altcoin name and hope someone mess up and buy Cash or 2x or whatever altcoin instead of Bitcoin. But in the long run the market decides which is the real bitcoin, just look at the price.

yea, imo trusted identity but with perfect verifiable vote count is a great improvement, like registering paper ballots in a secure blockchain. Make the voting process interactive, so there's proof of having voted, and for what, and verifiable count.
but isn't a concern that the trusted identity manager could start generating fake IDs?

The best way of protecting nodes/users is :
* **Using decentralized economic services:** like Bitsquare so miners can't bribe those actors (for example, remember Intel paying providers for not selling AMD processors even if they were free, only verbal agreements, nothing on paper). I think those would came with lightning, but who knows.
* **Have a pow change nuclear option:** I don't think bip148 is a nuclear option, just users playing their role. A nuclear option would be an ASIC resistant POW change. An that exists today and it's called Cuckoo cycles. That would disenfranchise miners for-ever. Bye.
* As OP says **reject contentious forks with user activated ones**: don't care if they fork again.
* and many other im not aware of.

you have to make sure people in the system can only vote once. you have to attach votes to people, how do you do that? how do you ensure that at the other end there is a person or a robot? or a dog? multiple people?
I think bitcoin can improve verifiable vote count, but the identity part that maps flesh and bone people to votes can't be done yet in a zero trust way. You can restrict the number of interactions in the system but not who was allowed in that poll or made what number of votes without a central registry and trusted institutions. It would be great if someone solved this.
even with biometrics you're trusting the reading device and that someone is not manufacturing high end replicas of eyes and fingerprints or custom made dna.
there was a project on github that went through all of this but I can't find now.

you can install dual boot linux and use as default os (and to isntall node software here) and then run a windows virtual machine for the software that is not yet available for linux.
if you need games you could boot to windows for performance, but if you need office style software or mini games a windows virtual machine will suffice imo.
but if you want serious security you must stop using windows.

don't use coinbase or any of these crypto web services as your main wallet because they are holding all the private keys of the users wallets.
so in reality they own your bitcoins and they can chose to do whatever they want with them. Or their servers could get hacked because it's a centralized service, a honeypot for hackers.
If you want to own your bitcoins learn how to set up and backup a wallet in your pc securely.

the financial problem Bitcoin is solving right now are high fees and censorhip xD
With the upcoming Bitcoin Lightning Network you'll have both the security of Bitcoin and the fastest and cheapest payment network that will make visa, mastercard and other middleman be thrown in the trash of history. 
Also many privacy focused companies and civil rights movements suffered of censorship from centralized and political influenced payment processors. and if some of them haven't yet, they are vulnerable by using them.

bitcoins or satoshis, that's my choice. I'd like very much a wallet that had two modes, one hyper technical with all the features of a lightning node replicated in the interface, and another that is just two buttons for sending and receiving, balance and tx list.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:33:08
why devs keep saying lightning is not ready yet? it is working in mainnet right now. All their statements afaik are wait for the network to become stronger, but what does that means specifically? And please don't point me to the github issues section. What could go wrong if users started using lightning massively right now? Bitcoin is still experimental as well.

@_date: 2017-11-15 12:09:03
To send bitcoins you need to pay a fee no matter what wallet or service you're using. The fee amount depends on the fee market that depends on the network activity and congestion. But some bitcoin banks (aka Coinbase, Xapo, BitPay) may charge you additional fees for their services. Fees have been rising a lot lately because of spam transactions and adoption. Still, always check that your wallet is not overpaying on fees.
The upcoming Lightning Network wallets will be able to send instant (no wait for confirmations!) bitcoin transactions with very low / no fees at all. Eclair, Zap are examples of those upcoming wallets but only work on Bitcoin test network right now so no for real money. You can test it and provide feedback to the dev team.

Segwit separates the signatures from the rest of tx data to fix tx malleability attacks. without tx malleability lightning would be much more difficult to do. all full nodes still transmit and validate the signaures, and after validation, they can prune them if they want to save more disk space. hope im right, or ask some expert.

This reasoning is even more stupid than believing that hash power defines what Bitcoin is. Nor hashing power nor market cap defines what bitcoin is. But being a stupid theory doesn't mean is not what is actually happening, because these people still don't understand bitcoin at all.
If you want to control a currency by manipulating the price go to some proof of stake coins and stake to the sky.

the 12 words are your 'recovery seed' so you can recover your coins and is the only thing you need to write down and secure. all the private keys to spend your coins for that wallet are derived by the software from that 12 word seed.
if someone learns your words he got access to all your money. make multiple copies of the seed and protect them from moisture and fire.
and if given the option always secure your seeds with a passphrase.

Bitcoin already increased the block size up to 4MB in theory (in practice about 1.7 - 2.2MB) when Segwit activated. 1.6MB blocks have already been mined in mainnet.

I read in some article that futures will enable price stabilization so major retailers (amazon) could start accepting bitcoin with less risk. and that futures will lead to the approval of an etf. unlike futures contracts it seems that for an etf contract they will need to hodl actual bitcoins so price goes up. but ask an expert (im not).

scnorr will combine all the signatures into one only, so less signatures means more space in the block for more transactions which means more txs will fit in the same space. seriously, one thing is not knowing how bitcoin or crypto works but your reasoning lacks the most basic logic.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:48:44
I have some understanding on how block weight works. afaik the only thing that makes blocks bigger is the inclusion of segwit data as it has a discount per current block weight rule.
the only thing I know about Schnorr is that is will combine signatures into one :) I don't know in detail how it will play with Segwit. I suppose the Segwit discount will apply to the only signature in the tx. IMHO I think that's very optimal for onchain scaling.
sorry if I was being an arsehole :].

@_date: 2017-04-20 10:24:09
segwit increases the blocksize to more than 2MB.
segwit disables covert asicboost
segwit has other important improvements
miners just don't want to enable LN, they don't want blocksize protection, they don't care about network centralization.
nation state bribes are of greater incentive than mining rewards.

Bitcoin is more broken than Vertcoin if we compare mining centralization for example. vtc has already changed ther pow more than once, and some core devs have suggested doing the same for btc. and it seems their dev team is doin very well. of course they didn't have political issues yet.

1. you can earn bitcoins by working for someone who wants to pay you in that currency.
2. there's also some websites called faucets that pay you some very few satoshis for watching ads, but very ridiculous amounts. The fastest way would be with a faucet rotator.
I recommend the first option, go freelancing.
@_date: 2017-04-18 09:44:11
if miners stop mining no tx get confirmed, the network will stop. but there are strong economical incentives to mine, and lot of investment at stake, so the real problem is miner centralization, just the opposite.

you're right, the final decision is in the hands of the users
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:53:20
it dosn't look like a network, so you can't compare with LN if you don't have routing. also channels are non bi-directional. also the semi-decentralized thing...
I prefer segwit, which has more advantages, it does not only enable LN, but a bunch of other improvements.
but it's nice to see people trying to provide scaling solutions, Bitcoin is pemissionless!
@_date: 2017-04-25 08:55:43
Bitcoin fees are calculated by tx size, so maybe coinbase charge you according  to the size of your total inputs/outputs and then they separate and recombine several inputs outputs from several users into a giant tx to save money. Maybe this way they are able to charge users less fees to remain competitive.
Wallets only know about your unspent outputs, that's why you only see your personal balance/charged fees.
edit: to clarify more, your fees are discounted from your personal output, but the big fee you are seeing is the discount of all the outputs in that tx.
@_date: 2017-04-21 18:22:22
You need to trust that the electrum server you are connecting to is not recording your addresses. The other way with bloom filters you have plausible deniability, so no one can ensure 100% that a bunch of addresses are linked to the same identity.
Also some non electrum wallets offer Tor-anonymizing features in a friendly way. No tor for android electrum wallet, afaict.
So maybe its more efficient , but can be less private

I'm not an expert but as far as I know:
* 1- The keys are generated from a shared secret. This shared secret is generated from the public keys of the intermediates nodes and the recipient node of the transaction. [ At least for lnd implementation, but since they are compatible I guess all follow the same rule.
* 2- Can't answer. But I can't see why it would be harmful.
* 3- An active LN node will be routing millions of payments and all the private key will be stored in the lightning application on that LN node. Hardware wallets are for secure storing not being transmiting money in real time. I don't know how integrated secure chips would work with it.
* 4- Can't answer.

yes multisig too, but with multisig alone you'll be putting at risk whoever owns the other keys. For that reason I think it's a mistake for privacy that addresses have different encoding for normal and multisig. is just letting others *know* you're using multisig. the owner knows, just present the script if it's multisig!

They are free, but they can't do whatever they want if they want to maintain business, they need to follow their users. Forks per se don't dilute network effects, users have to choose to move to the next fork or they need to be tricked to do so. If business change the currency without changing the denomination without informing their users they are commiting fraud, imo.
Bcash is the coin of the miners, so they can profit from asicboost and exploit the difficulty adjustment. And it seems like 2x will be the coin of the businesses.

just send your main hodlings to a smart contract that allows withdrawal in two ways:
- to some key you own at any time
- to some key owned by someone else you trust from your family, etc after certain date
then it's just a matter of rotaing the smart contract lock time and move the funds each time. if for some reason you are not able to update the lock, your family will have access to the funds.
It may be a hassle but you don't require any TTP. very succesful app imo. 10/10 would like to see an app that automates the process.
edit: each time you spend from the smart contract locked funds you'll need to send the change to the same or an updated contract.
edit 2: you could also specify multisig for the second withdrawal option, so you could specify more than one relative. expensive contract tho.

one thing I don't understand: all seems to back up to the Hong Kong agreement. Miners say Core didn't wanted to make a blocksize increase but Core brought up Segwit which is a blocksize increase from 1.7MB to 4MB. So the scaling debate is not about block size.

because for Bob to benefit from a most profitable previous state (transaction commitment) he will need:
- Alice's signature: which she won't provide unles both cooperate,
- waiting some period of time (for example 1000 blocks), 
if Bob goes the latter way Alice can use the valid Bob's secret for the previous commitment and spend *ALL* the money for herself, bob's money and her money. 1000 blocks are like ~~100 days~~ 1 week to generate, so Alice has all that time to connect to the network and monitor the channel and see if something's wrong. 
If she doesn't connect when the timelock runs out Bob could get his money. But then Alice would just have paid some other node on the network to monitor her channels so that they could store and emit her pre-signed commitments and spending txs if some party gets rogue.

I don't think a robber would have access to blockchain analysis data unless they were targeting you for a long time (never share your balances online). If it's a common robbery they just want pick money and run away quick IMO (and even in that case you could set up a vault (upcoming) to recover your stolen funds with another key). So just set up a trezor account with some little coins to avoid that risk.
And use coinjoin or smilar to avoid chainalysis. trezor wont help if the adversary have traced all your damn KYCered coins and have the time and means of obtaining info from someone by violent means!

... 2, 1, 0. I'm not getting paid, I tested It and was awesome. They precharge your wallet with 10USD and It lets upload your content automatically to other hosts like mega, drive, etc, and ALSO p2p networks like rarbg.
but **the most interesting part** is that pirated flagged material will not be removed, but just charged an appropriate fee in btc. So, even if you upload a pirated movie, you and the original producer will benefit from fees in btc. So it's a win win for everyone. watch and pay for the content you want to watch without doing anything illegal? that'd great. and a great push for btc price.
The downsides would be that they hold their proprietary file type, so even if the file is uploaded to a p2p net it'd only be accessible through them, but I think thats a requirement for their business model.

Again. We already have potentially a 2MB (1.7MB conservative) chain with Segwit alone. We don't need 2MB blocks, we dont need a 2MB hard fork that will ruin the experience of users with replay attacks. Because we already have increased capacity with Segwit because Sewit is a block size increase.
Read how Segwit works. Segwit can increase the block size to 2MB and beyond.
Segwit was a soft fork (secure) that increased the block size. We don't need to increase the blck size again with another 2MB hardfork with Segwit2X.

**Segwit alone ** increased the block size between 1.7MB (conservative) and max of 4MB *without* requiring a hardfork. Segwit alone is active right now and Bitfury miners already created a +1MB valid block. 
****Bcash is just the MinerCoin for miners to game the rules and profit from the brainwashed minds of r/btc sub.
The upcoming ****Segwit2X hard fork, if happens , will create CorporateCoin! increase clearing capacity and f*ck decentralization! only agreed by miners and corporations, the most vulnerable players to gov coercion and corruption :)

Let me remember you that Bitcoin does not rely on those actors alone and that is a decentralized system at its core. Those actors are basically centralized (**miners** geograpically in China and in power like Bitmain monopoly, and **corporations** have to submit to government regulation, coercion and hacks).
Also remember that none of the corporations that are pushing 2X forward did not ask their users for their opinion and now will be risking their funds without replay rpotection.

At 1:23 he literally says that if blocks are full and you try to close a lightning channel someone could steal your funds and that's totally untrue. This guy does not know how lightning network *works* and should not be giving tech talks.
On the very contrary if one rogue party tries to close a previous commitment tx and their tx is not included in a block then the other party has even more time than the timelock to acknowledge that bad behaviour (the locktime plus the time the tx is stuck in the mempool, so better!).
And if both parties close the channel cooperatively the tx will eventually get included as any normal tx by paying the correct fee.

that thing youre charging is a hardware wallet. it only stores your keys to spend your bitcoins... to get bitcoins you need to get mining equipment (very expensive). the other way to get bitcoins is to buy them at an exchange or accept them in exchange for goods and services, aka work.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:59:22
No it's more confusing calling Bitcoin to Bitcoin Core. Because Bitcoin Core is not a cryptocurrency, is the name of a software implementation that node operators run to validate Bitcoin.

sure, but the important thing is *where* you deploy it. you can deploy ery easly 1K nodes on the same aws account, thay can all be compromised by the same hack.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:23:36
nope. it's all the other way. Nodes define consensus rules. one of those consensus rules is the miner reward. if miners don't follow the rules of a network of nodes (notice I'm not calling it 'Bitcoin') nodes will reject their mined blocks and thus miners won't get their block rewards. they can fork away, yes, no one is stopping them. miners can span 40K nodes on AWS and mine their own altcoin, but if they want a reward they must follow even their own rules. What they can't do is force anyone else to run different software. Bitcoin currently is the network of nodes with the most network effect and more market cap. That is what defines 'the Bitcoin' for me. just store of value, open system, network effect and market choice. the rest of alts are following Nakamoto consensus anyway.

I read your full comment. I pasted the citation partially because I just wanted to point to that, not that I was dismissing it. I'm sorry if you misinterpreted that.
The best way to find bugs is to have real money committed to the code. A honeypot as people say. Bitcoin itself is still branded as experimental currency and people should know where they are putting their money. I'd think of those that put money in experimental lightning as donators to the cause or fools, or both. I understand the concerns of LN devs and I never opposed to that. Bugs can still be found in the so called 'final release' of the code though, so it's good to work in backwards compatibility from now. It's my opinion as a user.

the question about what is a full node all the answers asume the full node must be a wallet which is not the case. for example you cans tart Bitcoin Core with the wallet disabled.
also the question about the change the answer is very generic because it assumes only one type of transaction I think. if users start making batching txs they may receive and spend in the same batch without being the originator of the funds.
I love these tests.

decentralized consensus, you can't measure it, it just happens when enough people come together on the same consensus rules. miners start mining if they're economically incentivized. no one is in charge, is just a bunch of participants. it's awesome and it works so far.
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:43:43
you don't need internet today to transact with bitcoin. with blockstream satellite you just need a plate and a mobile network to receive and send txs.

nodes can reject miners blocks if they don't follow the rules. the most difficulty 'valid' chain is decided by nodes not miners.
if nodes reject blocks the miners would lose their time and energy.
mining is only used to prevent double spending (aka confirming transactions) but htey don't get to decide the consensus rules.

well if you buy a hardware wallet you'll also need to save the seed backup and take the same physical precautions with it as with a paper wallet. hw wallet additionally permits you to transact securely without the hassle to swipe paper wallets and recreate them. you can use a hw even on a compromised computer securely. if you plan to hodl 10x the cost of a hw, then go for it. but paper wallet are 100% the most secure way out there (if generated securely).

that's not in the whitepaper as I said. and guess what Satoshi is not God. *he was terribly wrong there* imo and I don't know what the fuck he was thinking when bringing up the specialized server farms (how is that compatible with peer to peer system?). he also thought trustless SPV wallet was possible, which hasn't been achieved yet (unless you run the full node).
pretty sure after that he rectified somewhere in some forum but I won't bring any quote about him because he is no more an active part of bitcoin development and discussion and he probably missed all what happened since.
all the effort since was to make bitcoin more decentralized. bitcoin today is not exactly what Satoshi had in mind back then.
god bless the people that came after him and reviewed all that stuff.
also that site links to other websites claiming an altcoin is the 'real' bitcoin. lot of misinformation. another more reputable source:

The *rate* at which channels could be created is the same as the tx througtput of the base layer, once channel is open just route via 2nd layer, you don't need anymore on chain txs unless problems.

in bitcoin there is no popular voting process. some code is written. you run it or not. you can run different code. that's how you vote. not an online poll that can be manipulated.
btw, my node will stay in current consensus with current pow unless devs bring up a better pow algo and explain and demonstrate how it'd be better. I don't see how just chainging pow will solve current miner dominance. how to avoid new pow to inherit current centralization because of current dominant position.
I personally  will never support a pow hard fork that is just kicking the can down the road if there is no current attack derived from centralized pow going on. but I agree having a valid option just in case

by running a full node and *using* it *(obviously...)* you validate your transactions by yourself, instead of trusting someone else to tell you that they are valid.
also full nodes contribute to the network's health because you also validate everyone else's transactions. Collectively all the full nodes maintain the miners in check, so they don't break the rules.

Of course all the constituencies of consensus he likes to talk about have very diffused limits, a miner is a user when he buys coffee and he certainly have to run a node to keep up with the consensus rules of the rest of the network. But what he is talking is about who dictates the rules alone, imho. 
No one has a saying, no one is voting or forcing rules. There's just people that trust and run bitcoin software.
Miners can either
- follow the chain (with the rules of the currency they choose to mine) 
- or they attack those rules. They can't do anything else.
Anything else that miners do to change the rules nodes run should be called an **attack**. Why should you choose to coerce anyone to run different software to run your implementation with a fork without replay protection? Why not just fork securely and leave the other network behind?
Miners should only mine the most profitable currency. miners should only follow these rules to operate:
1- How many % of the network this implementation represents?
2- Is it more or less profitable for me to mine it?
Miners should only care about short term profits to pay their electricity bills, and nodes only about long term profits because they hold. 
Because of that I strongly disagree about giving miners a 'vote' on the system. They just need to care about profit, they need to follow naturally the economy as they did with UASF BIP 148.

You can't measure consensus reading reddit. even node count. but what you can read for sure is someone trying to force someone into running another piece of code. it was meant to be a corporate takeover to centralize the sytem into a confirmations-as-a-service one controlled by big entities and easy to regulate.

@_date: 2018-07-26 13:04:14
yea but what if you put a nearly 100% efficient second layer on top of a very inefficient and constrained blockchain?
not only that, but doing so in a period of very low adoption? only empty blocks would be mined, and when block reward cant sustain mining farms wouldnt miners revolt to change bitcoin supply and make it inflationary? am I wrong? any future tellers here? is bitcoin limited block reward compatible with second layer?
maybe we could use something like this  as inflationary asset for mining, and for the users keep the normal bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:53:03
less nodes and mining more centralized. because nodes need to broadcast block data to the rest of the net and that represent bandwith cost. also the blockchain will grow larger and thats hard disk cost.

modern wallets generate multiple private keys because they create new addresses for each payment. So it would not be convenient for you to write all of them down.
With a seed you can derive all the private keys and you only have to write down 12 or 24 words, depending on your wallet.
You have to keep your seed offline and protected against damage, otherwise you may not be able to restore your money. the thing is, generally a private key alone can unlock the funds to a single bitcoin address, whereas a seed would unlock all the private keys for all addresses of a wallet.
you can restore a seed generated by one wallet on a different wallet but you'll need to check compatibility.

@_date: 2017-10-07 15:17:22
Two points: 
1- Increasing block size will decrease node count in the network, diminishing decentralization and thus destroying real value/utility of Bitcoin. There's a study by Bitfury that shows that increasing the block size to 8MB decreases node count by 95%. (Segwit2X will increase block size by 8MB).
2- The way Segwit2X (B2X) is trying to upgrade the protocol only with corporate and mining support is a dangerous way to go because they are the players that are more prone to gov regulation / coercion. They did not ask their users. 
Now regarding Lightning Network :)
The main scaling limit with Lightning is that users will need to settle the channel on the base layer (blockchain) from time to time when your channel becomes unbalanced (I think that would become rare the more channels become open because the same user can have a payment channel(s) with an exchange(s) and then just route the payments if one becomes unbalanced. Proposals like Revive for rebalancing channels without touching base alyer may only be needed if your current channel is the most cheap and you want to maintain it (but that would be part of the routing I think, not ux).
and then there's some other proposals like Plasma that creates a child blockchain and you only need to settle to lower blockchain levels without touching the base blockchain (which enforces consensus all the time) unless rare problems. Plasma is the same concept as lightning but not only for 2 parties. Anyone know the state of the second layer and that's different from lightning where only the two parties involved in the channel know the commitment history.
Also I believe Plasma can enable to run different economic policies to beat vollatility on second layer once everyone know the whole state but that's just my inexpert opinon ;)
I believe lightning and further dev can serve whole humanity and beyond for Bitcoin txs. :) we just need to keep base layer restricted and decentralized so we don't loose nodes. big blocks wmake more restrictive to run one. People that say 'oh satoshi's vision' doesnt realize that (decentralized)Bitcoin does not scale. we need 2n layer or it's the best way we know right now. just use base layer when a payment goes very very wrong as dispute resolution.

the users who will pay the streamers would need just a mobile wallet that doesn't consume much resources, like any current bitcoin wallet.
A mobile lightning wallet is a lightning node that doesn't connect to a local full node and doesn't route lightning payments.
whereas twitch would need to run a full node and routing LN node. 
the streamer would only have to provide twitch with a bitcoin address or the LN wallet node id.

just to play devils advocate, the fact that you know they allegedly did money laundering is good and would speak in favor of their system, but bitcoin is less regulated in that matter. I think bitcoin would need AML and KYC for mainstream adoption. but that's not a task for the protocol devs, it's a task for the apps, like wallets and centralized id systems.

@_date: 2017-10-02 09:54:55
There's 2 risks:
RISK 1!
Centralized Bitcoin services like exchanges and wallets start calling the new forked coin as 'Bitcoin' instead f what it is (Segwit 2X coin) to mislead you. You need to contact all the Bitcoin services you use and trust and ask them to clarify their position. Look after your money or someone else will. Specially if you store your Bitcoin in a centralized wallet service like Coinbase or Xapo.
RISK 2!
After the fork it's expected that the newly created forked coin will be less valuable than the current, original Bitcoin. Without replay protection when you send ForkCoin to another address you will be sending the same amount of original legacy Bitcoin to that same address! And because original Bitcoin will be valued let's say $5000, and the ForkCoin (2X) $500, you'll be loosing a lot of money in the form of legacy Bitcoin when you transact (but you'll loose more if you transact with ForkCoin).
So if you plan to create transactions after the fork you'll need to split your Bitcoin and your ForkCoins funds to different addresses. If you don't plan to transact then just hold and no more action is required. Just check the Bitcoin you buy is **actually** original Bitcoin.

present payments in fiat rather than btc or sats is brilliant. in that way people are presented a price they can relate to but underneath the wallet pays with bitcoins via lightning. brilliant.
omg imagine people kinda forget they are paying in bitcoin and just refuel channels via lightning fiat exchanges instantly. It will be a non stop buying bitcoins and trashing fiat! each lightning wallet will be a fiat burning machine. omg. I cant express how much I feel this is bullish.
but at the other side merchants will be converting to fiat to escape btc volatility. I wonder where the balance will break between both ends in favor of bitcoin.

where there is a market there is consensus. that's the beauty of this system. merchants are at the bottom of this pyramid. if they don't satisfy users they're out. if miners don't satisfy node rules, they are out. but miners can coerce with hashrate the merchants/businesses. but they can't coerce users/nodes.
the point is. you don't need to measure consensus. it just happens. users that find this useful will use it.
because mining can't coerce users/nodes but it can coerce exchanges mining is being used against exchanges (the on ramps) to misdirect the market into buying shitcoin by mislabelling shitcoins as 'Bitcoin'. that is the attack. that's why you can't measure hashrate alone to decide 'what the market wants'.

if you had your seed written in your phone, even if you think your phone security is not compromised best practice is to create a new wallet, write down the seed on paper or metal, this time do *not* write it in an electronic device, and transfer everything to the new wallet.

if theres a bitcoin fork all you need to do to get your 'airdrop' is make sure your coins before the fork dont move from your addresses during the fork. that is make sure you funds are confirmed in the chain before the fork.
once the fork is done the same address will hold both bitcoins and forkcoins. use a wallet with replay protection to spend securely. be careful about your privacy. never send your private keys to any service to 'claim fork coins'.

a pow algo change does not make a distinction btw pool or solo mining, it'd affect every miner.
If you think miners will start censoring transactions you can start thinking under which basis they will discriminate transactions.
They can say, well only tainted coins or only identified transactions will get mined. I think in that case the most conservative approach is to add privacy by default to bitcoin, to break their ability to discriminate txs. If they still censor private transactions users will bust the pow algo. I don't know how to detect if a tx is being censored.
this is not a game they wanted to get in voluntarily because of the incentives. but they can start being pressed by some gov, if most hashrate happens to be centralized geographically.
some Core dev was advocating 'no privacy without a pow change', and I think he's right because both are linked.

all lightning nodes must be hot wallets because they need to continuously access private keys to route other people's payments. and there's no use for cold storage if your wallet is gonna be 24/7 online.

it depends on the type of the upgrade, if the updates affect or not the consensus rules:
the update:
* does affects consensus rules (fork)
 * by making the current rules stricter (soft fork)
 * by relaxing the current rules (hard fork)
* does not affect consensus rules
and watch some Andreas videos to dig further into this because it's a complicated thing.
but in any case it's the users that choose to upgrade or not.
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:13:15
Satoshi did not foresee mining centralization it seems. in the original design in the bitcoin whitepaper he assumed all nodes will also be miners. I don't know how to detect if a transaction is being censored.
I think the incentive not to harm bitcoin rn is to avoid a pow algo change that will put them out of business, but we need a long term solution.
@_date: 2018-07-11 12:56:55

@_date: 2018-07-21 21:30:28
correct me if I'm wrong but the new fork chain will inherit all the outputs that open channels, but it won't inherit the equivalent channel balances (the intermediate commitments) in fork coins. So if the new fork ends up implementing lightning, you'll start with lightning channels with the equivalent negotiated channel balances in the original chain in the new fork coins.
But if the coin does not have lightning and you want to close the new channels in the new fork and get your funds back on chain you'll have to coordinate with the other party you opened a channel with in the original chain, because the channel opening transaction is a 2-of-2 multisig address with no time locks.
So from now on it's like the new forks will have to equip a LN node for their forks to remain competitive? that makes it harder to hard fork.
maybe you can think of lightning off chain state as a form of replay protection?

each 10 minutes on average, when a miner produces a block, the Bitcoin system gives them a reward of 12.5 bitcoins per block for the work done. this reward gets cut in half each 4 years, called halving. the next halving event will cut the reward to 6.25 bitcoins per block.
the reward is also a way of creating and put new bitcoin currency in circulation. miners will have to sell those rewards for fiat to pay for the mining equipment and expenses. the less bitcoins gets put in circulation, and with same or rising demand the price will be expected to go up. some say it will make the price to go up as it has historically done, but others say it won't be that much because most of the speculation today is done with non newly mined coins. im not sure about the last thing.

I would think adding extra protection like a little faraday box, water resistant, a dust protector for the usb connection, etc. other wise i wouldn't help witht he crowdfund. also more materials like silicone so it bounces if it falls..
also the design, please partner with some bitcoin artists to add more design options, not just plain colors, jeez.

lightning is totally optional. bitcoin has two payment networks, the onchain  (blockchain) and the offchain (LN) payment networks. you can choose which one to use for your payments.
you can't directly send a payment from one payment network to the other, but services will be developed that allow that. for example paying to an address to fulfill a LN invoice or viceversa.
lightning was conceived for micropayments, but it is possible to send big payments.

you already have to do kyc for buying bitcoins. but using a kyc wallet won't take away the freedom bitcoin gives because you always keep the choice of using another wallet, and bitcoin is about having a choice. I really want to live in a world where the choice is not between fiat and bitcoin, but one between a bitcoin kyc wallet and a bitcoin non kyc wallet. i think if we want mainstream adoption we have to conform in some way, and in the process maybe doing something better than the current system.
this would not be advocating for protocol changes with a specific implementation, just embedding kyc in a bitcoin wallet. and it would not be incompatible with a future more private bitcoin. other alts let you have private transactions by default and at the same time let you disclose your activities selectively to other parties. cant mention coin names because of this sub rules.

transactions in lightning are not asynchronous. async means you have an address and can send money without cooperation from the owner of the address. in ln both need to sign a new channel state, both need to be online.

imho there is two fundamental distinctions, if the blockchain is open or not. If it is open it doesnt matter if there is a foundation or group 'managing' it because anyone can fork the coin, the users still have the power to fork it and get rid of the foundations and inherit the previous code. and then if the code is open source it can flow btw both projects.
of course we can't comment specific coins here because rules, but you cant compare centralized private coin with another open source one.
so if your coin is like Bitcoin as it is now you're good :)
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:36:20

bitcoin has to evolve to something more private to become better money. when you pay with a dollar bill you are not exposing the transaction history of that dollar bill. with bitcoin as it is today you are exposing the history of everyone that used that money, and some coins may be linked to illicit activities. 
that will make some coins more *desirable* than others because no one will like to accept dirty coins that may put them into trouble. if some coins are more desirable than other it means some of them have more value than others and that is not sustainable because you expect that, no matter what coin you are paid for your job, you expect to be able to spend it as with each other coin. the property of good money that makes each unit worth the same compared to the rest is called fungibility, or ask some expert for a better definition.
bitcoin has poor fungibility because the chain of transactions is public. so we need a way to evolve bitcoin with software upgrades to hide the transaction history of all coins by default.
there's altcoins that accomplish this but we can't give names because we may get banned.

it'd great for legacy wallets to interoperate with lightning ones.


a bit off topic but I think It'd be better before doing the fallback to let the user choose a different lightning payment route if the current one fails. Show like two buttons on routing error: 
    [Error description]
    1. 'Retry' (wallet will try different ln route)
    2. 'Legacy payment' (onchain fallback).

any software developer would agree that if theres a bug in your program you should fix it asap. bitcoin mining is not playing as it should because its hardcore centralization and that can be perceived as a bug.
however bitcoin is not only a software project, theres a game of public perception, because bitcoin aim is to become more widely used as possible. how people perceive it is improtant for its future development.
from that point of view imo, a 51% mining attack on bitcoin would be as damaging as a disruptive pow algo change with no cause, from the perspective of an immutable and reliable payment network.
I support the less disruption as possible in the system. unless theres an incentive to cause disruption, as a mining attack, I personally wont support a disruptive change, but ill recognize bitcoin as the coin with the same core principles of openness and decentralization.

I think they knew they will be going their way no matter what. I think sponsorships are better than ads, but I don't like it getting a predominant position. I think the sponsor ad should get limited within a visual defined square and with a more noticeable 'Sponsorship' title and the whole size should be smaller.
also the other buying options should come right after it, not after many line breaks below. rn users have to scroll like twice to get to see other buying options.
but I don't expect a change because the actual design is not motivated by good guidelines of accessibility, but just for profit.

To use lightning you need to open a payment channel with another party. A payment channel is just a contract that your wallet signs with the other party (all secured by crypto magic).
when your wallet opens the channel it 'locks' your coins in a multisignature address that requires both parties to cooperate to move the funds. 
But before your wallet locks the coins it requires from the other party a signed transaction that guarantees that if the other party does not cooperate you can still recover your funds.
Miners only mine blocks in the blockchain so they dont play any role in LN. Coins don't need to be mined in the lightning network. 
There's no blockchain, proof of work or miners in LN. But it's still secure by cryptography magic (and it requires the blockchain to work).
The transactions that open and close lightning payment channels need to be confirmed in the blockchain. So your wallet, along with the other party, agree on a fee to pay.
When the opening transaction confirms, from that point, miners are not involved anymore and the transactions are recorded offchain, which makes transactions faster and cheaper.
the way coins move in LN is by mutual cooperation of both parties. You're still in control of your money. You wallet must remain online to detect fraud, or pay someone to be your *vigilante*, that's one caveat.

*(first of all where it says 'mainnet' in the questions it should say 'on chain' or 'Bitcoin blockchain' imo)*.
**What is Lightning Network?**
A payment network on top of Bitcoin that enables instant and cheap payments.
**How does one get/send bitcoin from the mainnet to LN?**
By opening payment channels with a LN node. Your wallet will provide an easy and visual way of doing it.
[There are services]( in development that will allow you to get back LN capacity by doing an onchain payment.
**How does one get/send bitcoin from LN to the mainnet?**
By closing a payment channel your final balance for that channel will be sent back to you in the blockchain.
[Some services]( provide you a way of setting up a centralized LN payment gateway to accept LN transactions, and send periodic on chain transactions to you when a limit is reached.
**Can you send Bitcion from LN to normal Bitcoin addresses and vice versa?**
AFAIK funds inside LN can only pay to LN invoices, which specify node destination IP, and other metadata. If you wanted to send to an onchain address you'll need to get your funds back to the blockchain, or use a service that will make an onchain payment upon payment of a LN invoice.
**What online/website wallets support Lightning?**
*  for testnet only. Do not use online websites to store your mainnet private keys.
**What desktop wallets support Lightning?**
* [Zap Wallet](
* [Lightning Desktop App](

People are used to use at most two decimals for their fiat currencies. I think if you start messing with multiple sub denominations between Bitcoin and all the possibilities all the way down to satoshis you're going to get new users confused.
And I think is more democratic because there's no standardization body in Bitcoin because it is supposed to be decentralized, so I think developers should not decide what is the default denomination and use what the protocol understands and works with and that unit is satoshis. People will always understand that more satoshis means more wealth.
Another think to avoid confusion would be to add a selector for a denomination in the Send tab of the wallet application, so it allows to do: 'Send 10 \[sat, bits, bitcoins, etc\] to 1xxxx' so people don't have to worry to convert between denominations,and then display how much would it be in the user's denomination of choice. Right now I think wallets only allow to chose a unique denomination for all the wallet functions.
Crypto has not achieved mass adoption yet so I would not worry about confusing existing users now, I would worry about confusing new ones. But at the end you can't control what developers do and education is the only way to get people to agree.
That's why I think default should be satoshis \(I agree not typing them as SAT or it would appear as a price ticker for another currency, more like Sat. or sat.\) and then let in the hands of the users to choose other denomination if they want to.
I'm no UI/UX expert, I'm just talking from the perspective of a user.

you can hold the keys in a wallet where you control the private keys and wait for wallets to release tools which allow you to split your free coins without giving up your private keys (or giving kyc data...).
I'm *starting* (huge /s here...) to think that these fucking spinoff forks are meant to centralize more and more private keys because people run the easy way to get free coins and instead of hodl themselves the keys they give them up to exchanges!

nodes don't put tx into blocks, that's the miners' task. the users' wallets broadcast the txs to the nodes, the miners who are also running nodes pick the txs and put them into blocks and run heavy computation on them to validate. when the miners are done they broadcast the new block with the tx to the rest of the nodes. when it reaches  Alice's node her wallet will alert her of confirmations

First of all when we talk about bitcoin being trustless means that the payments in bitcoin can be made without the need of intermediaries.
But your concerns are perfectly valid and Bitcoin is not yet mature enough to address them. Any honest bitcoiner would tell you that. They need to be developed not custodial models and backup services and KYC wallets that makes it easy to have the same level of accountability as the traditional financial system. (yes KYC as well f*kers because I dont wanna live in a Westworld dystopia).
The security of your coins right now depends solely on your decisions about which wallet to use, the devices you will use to store or transact, and all the protocol you came up with.
That makes bitcoin not grandma/kids friendly. Right now you'll read that since Bitcoin is experimental tech and in the early stages, some developers focus on the development of protocol level things, not very much related on user interface or user experience.
Bitcoin is not yet ready for mainstream use. We have to wait until payment channel technology (lightning network) is mature enough. But when the time comes I'm sure all the necessary tools will be available, when mainstream demands for it. We are getting there.

I think it's not a trademark thing. I'm no expert but I don't think you can solve it by attaching a trademark to a software repo because the coins are not defined in the code files, the coins appear when the system goes live. I think it's more like gold. gold is not a trademark, no one owns the word 'gold', but gold has physical properties that can be demonstrated. I think if we can achieve a framework like that but for bitcoin it would be great.

I don't want to say harsh things, but maybe you need to re-think all the business process. I don't see any way to protect the users funds in a trustless way (the Bitcoin way), the so called escrows. And that's the minimum set up for that kind of website for accepting irreversible funds.
Otherwise you are saying, 'send me your coins, I know how to manage them, with no guarantees.' when most people don't even know who you are. It's nothing personal, but Bitcoin is a *trustless system*.

open source *software* it's different than just knowing the cpu hardware architecture because in the software side you can check the code and verify and compile it. While in the hardware side you need a whole industry to make that equivalent process for you. there are known fabrication time attacks. I'm not saying that some hw are not an excellent option, just that no one can sell 100% security.
You can generate a bitcoin paper wallet in a 1km underground offline, air gapped, Faraday caged computer system with independently verified and compiled software. you can't have anything better than that.

you trust your hardware wallet doesn't have a wireles emitter for when you enter the pin. and you don't control the cpu fabrication process. even though it seems to be the best option. but nothing beats a paper wallet and an offline system, though most hw maybe approximates to 99.98%.

Maybe for asicboost miners. fees have grown to 40% of mining rewards for users. litecoin will enable instant free txs now that they have activated segwit. He last chance for bitcoin to achieve the same is uasf. Its coming.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:23:01
you are right. for instant *secure* tx you need LN, which segwit enables. iirc ln is still being developed.

Yes but the altcoin of that chain is very likely to be less valuable. To maintain profit miners will need to switch to the economic majority chain.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:25:20
serious miners are only Bitmain for you? mining decentralization is also an issue, so lowering the requisites is good for diversity.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:14:59
I agree there's room for politics... what about this definition: if the new chain starts from a new genesis block, then it would be called an altcoin, if not it's a fork (independently of the definition of 'valid' chain). In both cases a new currency is created.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:30:03
this coin deserved more attention, and now they'll get it.
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:08:59
BU has stated support for Lightning, but who knows if they are serious or if it's more of political manipulation. They want Lightning but with bigger blocks, it's really about centralize 1st layer with monster blocks.
I didn't see any miner studies about how Ln will affect miner fees in a serious way and how to balance block size with that in a cientific way to preserve Bitcoin properties of decentralization, we have only seen politics, and that's sad. some devs have done a lot to clarify technical things to the community but that's not enough I think.

@_date: 2017-07-24 15:09:27
jgrarzink does not understand segwit at all or he is playing dumb. just read this bs:


so segwit is not giving users a choice?? wtf?? users run the code they want to run! not only he does not understand segwit, he maybe  does not understand what a fork is. or what a user is.
but avowing ignorance may be another of their secrecy dev policies, as jihan does on twitter. Maybe they want to scare devs away to not review their bs implementation on github.
edit: this can not happen. they are using miners to waste Core brain resources to review their bs code. they are acting like leeches. and the best of all, signailng does not mean enforcing. haha. whiskey please.
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:39:12
it's good to have civil war and experience attacks from inside and outside to test the strength of the system. if bitcoin can't resist that then what's the purpose?

Bitcoin Crash Wright (?)
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:05:29
always was, but as long as miners play rationally the system is secure. the incentives are aligned to keep the system running as it is, or nodes may change pow and destroy big mining business. That's why they try other ways of disruption, more like getting more control and influence over the protocol changes, for example, instead of directly attacking with 51% hash power. 
the key is, miners needs resources to attack, but by playing fair they can benefit.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:36:41
afaik the cve just explains the tech stuff? it does not explain the network effects?

nah. there's no 'proof' ...
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:59:10
then its a flaw derived from resource management. but its still a flaw. blocks weren't intended to be empty. remember that the same rules apply for everyone so a protocol update would not be harmful for the ecosystem. pow are a mean to validate txs, nothing else.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:17:33
Actually small blocks make higher fees, it seems right to me having a high fee on chain txs and low fee microtx network (lightning). looks cool. I read with a 2mb increase the blocks will actually be 8mb. nodes are not voting for those requirements increases and thats unfair &gt;:).
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:18:58
i wonder if it's like a pepr wallet? I don't see a qr code as I suggested in another comment?
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:18:49
thanks! :) same to you!
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:49:22
totally agree. that's why I expect some sort of new agreemnt in between. the same way bip148 served users to get segwit miners may use the 2mb split to negotiate a rational 2mb increase (maybe by adding node incentives, who knows).
as side note, 'rational' is a relative term referring to the incentives of bitcoin itself. you can't define 'rational' just in relation the the whitepaper. if some nation state gives miners more incentives than the bitcoin system to perform an attack, they'd still being acting rationally to its own interests by attacking (hashrate mostly concentrated in China).

@_date: 2017-07-25 16:27:31
why they don't just fork the code and start building their own independent chain from scratch like ltc but with big blocks? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:35:54
thats why you need to use a trusted guard node. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:45:14
it's not about who or the hashrate. it's about setting the precedent of the economic majority overcoming miner blockades against protocol improvements. the nodes have already made the decision now they are putting that decision into effect.
@_date: 2017-07-14 09:29:27
I also read in the document:


they are talking about authentication in the protocol itself? that would differ from bitcoin's model, where there's only authorization, by psudonymous identities. Also verification? maybe there'll be a trusted key pair owned by exchanges or miners that will mark txs as 'valid'? whatever, they need to read the bitcoin whitepaper anyway...
there will be also coordinator nodes:




also there will be distinction btw verified and non verified issued coins:


@_date: 2018-04-27 13:37:22
no need to own anything. between bitcoin users they just need to agree on which nodes to use, they can call the units whatever they like. problem is if you are served a fraudulent wallet, a fraudulent exchange and block explorer. that's why i think exchanges nd wallets not only need to advertise the price ticker and coin name but also the software version of the nodes they are running for each coin.
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:02:10
which one? there's two.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:01:05
afaik there's no wallet capable of that. you may need to do that programmatically by pregenerating a new address for each utxo from the actual hd wallet and then mapping each utxo to spend on a new address to create a tx that spend the full amount (minus fees). You can also use the new addresses for change. 
good luck I don't have time for that, but certainly will pay a small fee for that service ;)

agree with belchers answer, but miners are not tied to any software to perform validations as long as the rest of the network accepts their blocks. even if there was an issue they could create a software that stops validating/receiving txs until they found a block with the txs they have or notice a new one. miners also have their own network to rely blocks faster. I would be more concerned about big txs with lots of inputs that take minutes to validate (something segwit solves).

Having little hashing power from a centralized cartel of miners is good for a decentralized coin. That's why it may be changed to begin with, my friend.
it's my right to choose which client I run as user, which rules my node will validate, if I want a pow chage I'll *run* it. Miners task is only to validate those rules, that's it. if they don't cooperate, fired.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:10:39
reading here  that most segwit txs types are bigger than the current ones, so they will inherently be more costly to confirm. But yea, assuming demand will not increase bigger blocks will mean less fees for the users. And with lightning even less.

No one forced anyone imo, if you just play your role as user then it should be fine. miners also played their role. and uasf is a tool for users to enforce their power.

people are hodling more because of the upcoming chain split. that's because some low fees are confirming too.
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:53:37
i thought there were two different bits to signal, 1 for bip141 an 4 for bip91??
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:11:14
some miners do! they don't know how bitcoin works.
edit: added 'some'
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:10:52
problem is you are seeing the fastest fee. 21.co is categorizing the fees by time. I don't know how much time would take with btc.com fees to confirm my txs.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:06:19
I would advise Bitcoin Core team to create their own Litecoin implementation. We don't know to which extent miners can influence the existing Litecoin Core dev team. 
IMO if UASF approach fails Litecoin will take over Bitcoin. ASICBOOST has corrupted Bitcoin mining incentives.
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:38:28
lol, the only coins that are vulnerable to that are the casascius ones.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:16:51
I thought the fee price was set by the fee market of users competing to get their txs included in the next block :P
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:24:52
UASF to enforce the best scaling solution the best engineering team has built: Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:28:03
it should be regarded as taking rid of a vulnerability (centralized mining coercion), so the value should go up in the long term. With a pow change the previous miners will not be able to attack the chain anymore with their well established mining monopoly.
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:54:04
The title is also misspelled but I would like a source and an internet archive backup.
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:27:53
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:20:16
some say, though it's risky, to invest in the bip 148 chan bitcoins as they will surpass by far the legacy bitcoin (with no segwit). 
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:14:59

It's value is derived from the network of users. Also miners burn energy to build the blockchain. It has limited supply, so do not worry about inflation.
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:06:42
obviously. I'm not comparing, but it's still an issue.
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:24:08
It's a lot different. Written agreements do not change the software protocol. The users who run the code and the economic majority are those who decide how they want the procol to develop.
And there's always the option to change the POW.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:36:04
read OP tweet. he pays people.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:17:06
you can't disrupt a decentralized disruption.
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:00:46
The blocks would be filled in months again, and BUers rethoric would change to something like 'lets 4MB hf now!'. Before incrementing the blocksize we need to take into account the propagation times because mining is centralized in China and chinese gov can manipulate the block propagation with their Great Firewall to favour miners inside their country. Mining is already centralized in Chinese jurisdiction. Their equipment can be confiscated at any time to perform an attack.
So it would be smarter to address these concerns before increasing the blocksize. Maybe with weak blocks and IBLT. But it needs to be discussed. It's not just 'oh let's just increase the blocksize'. The block space can be optimized to fit more txs, and that's wat Segwit and Schnorr sigs can do. Segwit unintentionally fixes asicboost (a bug that corrupts mining incentives) as well.
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:50:17
is the title a reference to BDSM fetishism?
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:08:04
The number of nodes doesn't count for UASF activation.
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:51:06
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:56:08
If I understood correctly, Bitmain will be using asicboost and selfish mining attacks to mine privately a hard fork that changes block size rules?!
They say they'll only do so if bip148 becomes a threat to them, but who knows. They are indeed assuming they can do it.
wtf. If that's the case Core should act immediately.

@_date: 2017-06-23 16:20:46
interesting to notice that Andreas posted a new video talking about that same thing, centralized ethereums.

I would cut off Keiser and Ver from the video. Don't mix Bitcoin with conspiracy and politics, plz. Bitcoin is just removing centralization risks.
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:41:45
most likely. read this section
that is because profit conscious miners tend towards the more profitable chain, I wonder if some gov gives some of them more incentives than the btc protocol though (besides asicboost).

no. what is a feature is the uncensored flow of value through the Internet. the info / value transfer itself is not the problem.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:18:53
yeah but think that people would oppose that. but if you give them the two pills (sweet segwit and toxic big blocks) in the same recipe you can create dependency on the users because any other chain will be attacked with majority hashrate. 
Right now they can only block the activation and they can't hard fork. They want to influence the other constituencies of consensus, right now they only influence the hashrate. they not only want segwit with big blocks but only their implementation by their own dev team. maybe they want ignorant satisfaction and acceptance from users who don't see the whole picture.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:43:21
but it's still FUD.
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:50:53
we can also say Bitcoin is backed greatly by miner greed.

ok, then devs would start contributing anonymously in an open source manner with community vote for merging.
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:45:30
Dr Back speculated about a dynamic block size based on demand: 
I read Monero economically disincentivices miners who mine big blocks:  
There's also BIP103 proposed by Pieter Wuille that adapts the size to tech growth:  
But as Andreas said it's all about scaling while preserving trust, not only the block size.
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:02:25
Miners are not guardians of the development, those are the users who try which implementation they run. Miners follow the most profitable currency and enforce the validation rules and secure the chain against double spending.
There are no single guardian in Bitcoin, as Andreas said there are other participants in the ecosystem and we need a common agreement.
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:23:01

I disagree. MongoDB would be better.

source please. any poll source? or your main source is reddit? just saying.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:18:04
With smart contracts you can say "before D date it's required 2 of 3 keys to redeem the funds from this address, but after D date has passed only this other key K is needed." you would need to redo the contract and move the funds when D has passed if you want to maintain the contract conditions, so it would be  a little costly to maintain with current fees.
It would be great if some hw had this sort of function. like when entering a specific password triggers a tx to update a specific contract being up to the owner to remind himself to input the password.

agree. even more, the connections to these hubs will be made via tor network, and anyone can run a hub. it's an open competitive system. and the author seems not to understand what LN aims to, like when he/she says:


it misses the point that in between the opening and closing txs you can make billions of payments without touching the blockchain.
and I don't understand this, help please? 


is he referring to the hubs' perspective or the users one?

you may be the biggest hodler of all of us.
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:29:46
I don't understand the blocksize limit then. Wasn't it aimed to reduce storage and badwith? if nodes are already grabbing most of the txs from the mempool through compact blocks then why the blocksize limit? The blockchain would grow at a faster rate with bigger blocks, but that's just going to happen anyway in the future, even with off chain layers. Does it mean all blockchain would sometime become centralized?
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:11:48
Not if nodes don't follow up. right now core is the most used implementation and it will reject 1MB+ blocks, but not the Segwit ones.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:55:18
it will not be secure to transact around Aug 1st. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:25:26
Most web wallets do not charge fees for moving funds between their accounts. They are using the 'scaling solution' term just for marketing purposes. The best decentralized solution in Lightning Network. Web wallet solutions are not an option to me.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:21:31
They want to uncover all the non-privacy conscious users and save their info to a database. Maybe in the future not being in the titanium databases would give you some problems. Remember, they'll fight us and then they'll lose. Bitcoin would remain censorship resistant.
@_date: 2017-06-26 08:54:21
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:25:18
yea my point is your second if.
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:42:04
does it mean giving up against mining centralization and give them their own gigantic centralized blockchain while keeping the same limits for the rest of the nodes in a parallel blockchain?

With Segwit you won't need to open a channel for such a log time. It would allow opening short lived channels and extend them to eternity as long as you trust the nodes of the route. Also bad nodes would eventually reach a ban score  and start being rejected as part of routes.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:07:45
run a bip 148 updated client to activate Segwit to make Lightning Network possible.
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:20:13
the fees are based on the transaction size not it's 'complexity'.
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:07:19


@_date: 2017-06-01 10:20:39
I mean the economic majority chain will be more valuable that any other chain, independently of the hashrate. And if the majority hashrate starts attacking the economic majority chain with less hashrate then we just need to change the pow algorithm for protection. Vertcoin has survived lots of attacks like that and changed their pow at least 2 times afaik.
the altcoin definition is a very relative term.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:52:40
I'm only a retarded
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:40:45
well if 'valid' means validating all signatures then yes. But 'valid' within the bitcoin protocol may not mean that.
I think the point is that if most nodes agree on a chain then they agree on all the signatures as well so the consensus is maintained. I wouldn't consider that 'bad'.
edit: also all the signatures are still required for bootstrapping a node right?

I've read that before my post but i think it's a bit different. they have their own system so they don't depend on any underlying blockchain. I was inspired by another post of Charlie Lee if I remember correctly that said that LN would enable decentralized exchanges and on that feature I think we can build a protocol stacks.

Bitcoin Core is a well known and respected team of developers. They do an excellent job and I'm very happy with them. any implementation would give genetic diversity to the ecosystem and thats good imo (though litecoin is like a btc clone :/).

If you've exchanged first the new signed commitments then there is no problem, even if the other party witholds its secret. You just publish the present updated commitment and get your funds. Knowing the previous secret is no requirement for creating new commitment txs.
There's no such scenario when you hand a secret for a previous state *before* getting a new valid commitment tx from the other party. The other party requires knowing your secret and your signed *output* to steal your funds (not only the signed *input*). and you won't sign and publish the current commitment output unless the other party refuses to sign and give you a new commitment tx.
