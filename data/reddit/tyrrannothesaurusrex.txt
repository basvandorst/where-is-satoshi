Cool to hear what the real Satoshi thought about it.

Let's hope it doesn't take that long

A store of value needs to have stable value. We're not there yet.
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:22:09
It's funny how people always say "but Bitcoin isn't *backed* by anything", not realizing that's exactly the case with the fiat they use every day of their lives. Governments do not guarantee the value of the currency. What they actually do is rob the population by increasing the supply and diluting the value right out from under their noses.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:08:05
Hopefully Bitcoin doesn't go the way of other technologies associated with the sex industry like digital video or the internet, or money. Oh wait...

Bitcoin needs to grow beyond the .1% of the population of cryptoanarchists and overweight engineers with unwashed ponytails if it's going to be a substantial currency. That means more mainstream adoption. It's a good thing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:40:50
Does anyone else think traders attempting to short bitcoin are going to get badly burned? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 19:56:47
Give me a break, could this be more hyperbolic? Nobody really knows the true future impact of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:21:06
This is actually the one scenario in which bitcoin goes to $0.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:41:29
Newcoiners, just remember that the price will always drop after you buy, and rise after you sell. Then it will wallow for months while trolls rage at each other and spar with competing predictions, memes, and bad advice. The news cycle will kill bitcoin every day, and every day it will be reborn. And in the end, you will either be a hodler or hodler-not.
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:22:48
Some large companies like Dell and Overstock now accept bitcoin, and you can expect the number to increase either way. It doesn't have to be an overnight revolution, just a gradual displacement of old slow tech with new fast tech. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:13:41
No you would just be forced to scale them back to the level of basic survival.
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:18:55
This might sound dumb, but what does "supply" refer to?

I don't see how funding public works = redistributing money to the few.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:37:08
So how do you get the public key from your random private key?
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:29:45
Once you generate a public address in your local wallet app (the destination for Coinbase funds), you can just lock down your local wallet and you never even need to open it again (except to spend/send btc). I put mine in a [truecrypt]( archive and back it up in multiple places and just forget about it. You can continue sending funds to that same public address and they will always go to your locked, private wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:56:22
Even better is the fact that you don't need to protest. The better tech will win.

Turn off all government services and infrastructure on 300 Million Americans and see how that goes.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:53:21
Right, it's unfeasible for a small community to take on such a large project, therefore they would be forced to go without it. It would be a bit like rewinding the clock to feudal times.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:39:10
Yeah that seems pretty reasonable. You'd still have to solve the issue of much larger scale infrastructure though.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:12:12
Yes, in many countries.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:57:00

I don't really see what's so terrible - they just got the wrong guy. What is so vilifying about being associated with bitcoin? If people thought I was Steve Jobs  I'd just say "sorry wrong dude" and get on with life.

Well if you live in one of those countries that already has failed and cannot maintain basic services then I guess I agree with you. My country (USA) is ranked top 20 for most quality of life indexes, so for us that would be a terrible choice.
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:19:20
This just sounds like a process of degrading quality and efficiency. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:47:56
Why not, considering it has in the past, even without mainstream adoption?
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:05:05
I don't agree that it's a police state or a gutter. I think you are deep in hyperbole. There is plenty of political corruption and inefficiency, but the quality of life for most people here is very good. If you consider a middle-class American lifestyle to be dogshit then you're either an out-of-touch billionaire just a glass-half-empty kind of person.
@_date: 2014-08-18 03:28:00
The fact that different currencies have different benefits and niches by itself is reason to think that they will coexist. We have dollars, but we still have casino chips, we have virtual in-game money, we have shares of things, we have point systems that quantify value. I see no reason that many coins can't coexist in a highly fluid exchange system.

Personal experience is valuable, but limited to your situation.  You can't simply extrapolate an isolated arrangement to apply to a country with 300+ Million people who have completely different backgrounds and cultures.


Yes people posting engineering schemes in internet videos sounds like a great approach to infrastructure. People chip in? Good luck with your $3 Billion kickstarter to build a bridge that only benefits 2 cities.
You are high if you think a major bridge costs 300k$. materials alone are orders of magnitude higher than that.
Basically, I agree with you that your model works at a certain limited scale, but is undemonstrated and not thought out at large scale, and a lot of your points are unrealistic or just silly.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:01:58
I think a true, transparent and more granular democracy, combined with a true free market solves these issues. Dividing countries is interesting, but it would suck to be born into a shitty one.
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:48:14
The idea is that if the whole country pitches in, huge projects are affordable. The alternative in this example is that every city funds their own smaller, less efficient project.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:37:12
If you got rid of government you would need an alternative vast, organized system to replace it, or else face rapid decay of the whole infrastructure and society.
Not to say major changes wouldn't be good, but total anarchy is a joke.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:12:46
fuck roads, right?
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:58:35
Or strong people will just do what they want, systems collapse, and everyone else is screwed as seen in failed governments all over the globe.
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:39:13
I think it is overly idealistic and unreliable to expect people to just pay for everything voluntarily. It needs to be either incentivized or required.
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:17:19
Do major roads and bridges generally break even via tolls, without government support up front or throughout? How many toll roads would you need to service the entire road system?
You will always have more capacity to do things with tax revenue from the entire country, vs placing the burden on local communities. It seems to me that it would limit local infrastructure significantly if there was no national support.
@_date: 2014-07-24 22:54:07
I think that's basically a good idea, although if you're ever played Risk that isn't always the best strategy.
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:07:12
You could make better governments in theory, but if they don't have tax revenue, they can't physically do anything.

No way, itunes was a way to herd consumers into an ecosystem (apple) where their content and purchases would be locked to that one company which has total control.
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:18:32
Yeah definitely. I think we just need better transparency and control in spending.
@_date: 2014-07-24 23:05:13
Ok, so you can choose to be unemployed and have no money, excellent.
@_date: 2017-02-04 03:19:18
I recommend averaging out the risk by buying in small regular increments, for example $100 USD with each paycheck.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:10:34
I can see this working for a limited amount of time, in small communities. But who is going to build a $3 Billion bridge and regulate the quality of the engineering? Donations? What will keep greedy companies from paying desperate workers $2/hour, which is what is happening right now in countries with less regulation.
Multiply these problems, especially large scale infrastructure problems across millions of people with different economic, cultural, and language backgrounds.
Yes, I think society could exist without central government, but it would basically be a stagnant feudal system of thugs (like your mobster guys) protecting/controlling subsistence peasants.

I'm a bit dismayed at the lack of information just to get coins out of my own wallet, and using a popular app. Bitcoin has a long road ahead to gain mainstream adoption if enthusiasts like myself can't even figure out how to access their own money.

Tip: if you are interested in gold as a store of value go for 1oz American Gold eagles at the lowest price over spot. They are standardized and will always be accepted by any business that buys gold.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:49:03
It has qualities that make it useful as money. Portable, divisible, scarce, universal, fungible, recognizable, etc. Intrinsic value is not always what matters (as with bitcoin, dollars).
@_date: 2019-04-22 23:09:47
Gold does have practical value as a mineral but not nearly the value based on it's use as money and store of value.
