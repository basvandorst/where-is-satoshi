Ya know, you have an excellent point of view.
I just still think there is one main entity that controls Bitcoin, I don't know why. But being as greedy as I once use to be, I can see why someone would want to control the supply.
Thanks for the genuine discussion and sorry for being a twat to you.
@_date: 2019-02-18 04:46:41
I'm all for the bullish narrative but I'm beginning to understand why so many people are bears- there's noone buying.
@_date: 2019-02-23 09:31:07
Institutions have been accumulating for years. 
If you think any differently than you are naive. They can manipulate this market for generations to come with the supply they probably have by now. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 19:08:33
Although the chances are small for one million within a year, it's still possible.
@_date: 2019-02-05 19:08:59
What else is obvious to people with brains? Social media manipulation such as this.
@_date: 2019-02-24 05:39:43
I quite literally stated in my reply who is running the show.
Exactly, $60 billion. In theory, one entity could quite easily hoard the majority of the supply of Bitcoin. Slowly via manipulation, entirely controlling the price to the point where they own literally almost all of it.
It's very hard to wreck someones short who has enough coins to ensure resistance isn't broken.
With futures it's pretty fucking easy dude. Buy $1M BTC on spot, while longing $1M on futures.
You spent $1M on spot but your futures trade just generated 300% or $1M due to leverage. 
Really not that hard to figure out.
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:08:17
Psychology tells me there will be one very very deep bear trap prior to lifting off for real. I think you're right. I don't think we have seen final bottom either.
@_date: 2019-02-23 22:35:25
Were you born this stupid? Serious question
@_date: 2019-02-23 22:31:43
If you're too stupid to figure it out for yourself then you deserve to lose money.
I put thousands of hours behind my research do you really think I'm just gonna always use facts for you lazy bastards? Fuck no.
@_date: 2019-02-05 19:11:27
This is honestly incredibly on-point.
Because of Bitcoin I have invested literally every waking moment I have where I'm not lifing, to the charts.
I am learning information that in my opinion will be so valuable later on in life.
Losing my ass in Bitcoin was hands down the best thing that has ever happened to me. I 'paid for my tuition' on the higher side, but I'm still learning every single day. This guy knows.
@_date: 2019-02-18 04:48:16
Not if you have stops.
Sure you'll get stopped out here and there but the thing is if you keep getting stopped out then your entries are bad and you just suck at trading anyway. Like me. Haha
@_date: 2019-02-05 19:09:18
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:08:49
Lol you never do grow a brain do you?
@_date: 2019-02-24 05:09:53
1. That's why we have futures.
2. There is one entity who has ultimate control over this space. If what a smaller whale does is not in their plan, that whale gets eaten for breakfast. All other smaller whales in comparison to the team that runs Bitcoin just do intraday movements, and they never take it too far, so they don't get eaten alive.
If you truly believe there isn't a single entity running the show in this space, you're deluded or unable to grasp the concept on just how greedy people truly are.
Whomever it is that created Bitcoin is the one running the show. I'd bet my life on that.
@_date: 2019-02-21 04:58:38
Posts like this piss me off.
First of all, they're protecting themselves against fraud.
Secondly, they are attempting to also protect you by verifying the transaction.
If you don't want security measures in place while sending money fine, but don't fault a business because they do it. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:06:51
Not quite yet, but yes, it's most definitely coming. Probably not until 5 or 6k tho
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:52:31

I highly, highly doubt Bitcoin has bottomed. When Bitmex began futures trading the prices tanked.
Now we have Fidelity and Nasdaq entering the scene and they're gonna want a piece of the pie. More than likely Bitcoin is going to be shorted into the ground until buying power becomes too immense. Either way though, to me, practically any price Bitcoin is at right now is a good buy. 
Study Elliott Wave theory, that will help you out quite a bit. 
We are starting wave 3 after this correction which should in THEORY result in the highest rises Bitcoin has seen yet. 
All depends on where Bitcoin catches support. I feel like $1k will NOT break. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 11:47:46
It could just as easily pump screwing over that many more people
@_date: 2019-01-20 23:21:37
Problem is they'll do this far easier without the ETF imo.
They are, and have been..
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:13:30
Essentially, yeah.
@_date: 2019-01-27 13:13:39
Not OP but can tell you this much-
You deposit BTC, you withdraw BTC.
What you trade back and forth are basically a 'paper' form of Bitcoin.

Until there's a decentralized network we can use instead ;)
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:15:52
I honestly don't know. I am still very new to Crypto but learning at an exponential rate. I've noticed before, that my withdrawal addresses given to me by the nano, change too. I have read online that the Nano does that? IDK. I didn't even realize you could have multiple wallets on the app. The interface I see only gives me an option to send, receieve, settings, account, and thats it.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:27:58
I am an amateur, so do not take my advice.
Go to this chart, and scroll alllllllllll the way down to towards the bottom of the most recent updates. It will explain everything.

Holy lord thank you so much. I was getting ready to send Satoshi a donation, which is very important to me. :)

@_date: 2018-12-01 08:32:37
HODLers don't matter. Nor do the new holders. What matters is the amount of money involved. Wall Street and banksters are gonna short this thing into the ground so that they can ride the next wave to ATH.
I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest to see a &lt;$1k BTC. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:07:30
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:55:33
Check the charts.
2011 saw a 93% drop. Ironically, it was in a wave 2. Guess where we are right now? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:37:55
Wave 2 long term.
This is why.
@_date: 2019-05-26 01:59:45
Holy shit this comment
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:10:52
Big shorty you mean?
Yep. Institutions are just gonna come buy everything lmao
@_date: 2019-05-31 06:25:47
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:54:18
Why would a bank run make it easier to short?
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:23:22
There will never be institutional money? Tell that to the charts where the DJI is going down while Bitcoin is getting close to oversold.
You're delusional if you don't think institutions aren't already in this market.
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:12:29
I keep trying to tell people. This isn't the end, thus is the beginning.
We have a laughably small market cap that is now roughly 8 times lower than its all time high and even THAT is a drop in the bucket.
The long term chart for Bitcoin shows the real growth of bitcoin hasn't even begun yet.
Right now institutions are fighting over who can hold the majority share, it's gonna go down, obviously.
But man, when it starts to actually show a sign of life again..
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:14:47
The chart alone shows McAfee is being somewhat conservative aiming for a 1M bitcoin by 2021.
Technically, the real FOMO hasn't even begun yet.
A lot can happen in a year but unless something catastrophic happens to Crypto or bitcoin, the CHART at least shows the most powerful wave right around the corner. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:10:01
Wave 3
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:33:34
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:08:09
To be fair, we were in a massive range that institutional money defended. If we didn't have people manipulating this market for their own gain we would of fell a LONG time ago.
$6k was defended all year by some entities with extremely deep pockets. If that money wasn't there, we likely would be climbing out of the bear market already. This is just my opinion though..
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:06:40
Bruh, we just dropped 50% without any substantial retrace. Anger and depression shows 6k happening again but at a much lower level. Then a final blow.
I don't know what you've been paying attention to but on reddit in my opinion especially people are barely even nervous yet. It's still memes and when moon. You'll know the bottom is in because people will eventually start saying when dump
@_date: 2018-12-03 06:39:49
Shit I would be too.
I think Bitcoin is going to end up almost always having 80-90% corrections at this point.
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:28:08
Good God did I need to see this again.
Thank you stranger. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:29:45
This is what I believe too. 
Wall Street can and has been shorting this fucker. We will know when the true bottom hits because the volumes and volatility when it happens will dwarf anything we have ever seen in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:05:12
Just curious. Are there any perks to doing this?
@_date: 2018-12-27 00:25:38
I want to open a node just so I can be one of the good guys. 8D
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:55:16
God I hope you're right. I also pray you're wrong.
If the drop happens THAT fast the bounce will be epic as fuck lmao.
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:18:33
I've always been a gambler, but losing the majority of my money in Bitcoin got me into learning how markets work and how to trade.
I self taught myself quite a bit, I'm by no means a professional, but I'm actually incredibly glad everything has worked out the way it has..
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:01:38
When everyone believes something and is greedy about it, that's what happens.
Bitcoin is in my opinion a giant social experiment.
Anyone who believes Bitcoin will go parabolic again wants to buy more for as cheap as possible.
Bulls know it. Bears know it.so, we have this drop.
If Bitcoin drops to $1k like I also think it will, that means yes it did face a 95% correction. 
But you also have to think about the fact that in 10 years bitcoin went from 0 to 20k and STILL held above where it started. People aren't paying attention to the fact that technically even after a 95% correction, early adopters still made a fucking killing.
YOU can be the next early adopter. The second wave of millionaires. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:55:03
Prediction of $421,232 by EOY checking in, I haven't gone anywhere and certainly don't intend to any time soon.
My opinion was obviously quite delusional, but this entire year has substantially opened my eyes to this entire market.
I'm no longer part of it, but only temporarily. Waiting on a confirmed trend before I make any more moves.
Still bullish long term and I doubt even a $500 BTC could change my opinion on that. We get close to $100 and maybe I'll change my mind..
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:07:13
Down. 
Lots of reasons why
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:16:59
The price is below $4k because institutions are shorting it into the ground while accumulating. The price isn't this low because people have decided it's not worth it. Prices this low won't be around anymore in just a few years, mark my words on that. 
@_date: 2019-05-31 06:25:08
No, you're not. 
There is a very high chance this does not end well for the majority.
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:58:15
LOL $20k will be a blip on the radar.
We start wave 3 long term on the next rise.
In theory we should outright destroy our old ATH by many magnitudes
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:36:36
Once that happens I'm all-in.
If it begins to tumble lower I'll just look away for a few years.
If I had a dollar for every person that has said pretty much the same thing about $1k I'd have a lot of dollars.
I feel pretty fucking confident 1k won't be breached and if so it won't last long.
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:06:20
According to the chart we should technically see an all time high that eclipses the first one...
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:03:38
Hahahaha the Bart pattern is a newcomer to the futures market.
Funny, that is almost exactly what I suspected it was a while ago.
Some trader making purposefully MASSIVE temporary buys. Ironic to know it's usually a new guy holy shit that makes so much sense 
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:55:58
Problem is, those "too many" people can't outweigh the power of wall street or bankers. Wherever THEY want Bitcoin to go, it will go..
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:36:09
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:12:41
You think daily futures are going to help reduce the volatility? Lolwut
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:08:44
Imagine the correction bitcoin would experience coming down from a million dollar ATH. Holy moly
