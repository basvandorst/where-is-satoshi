Wow never really thought about that, but it makes perfect sense. An example of this is calling people uneducated and stupid when using the word bcash. even though the only existing proof of the bcash coin is it’s github and medium article. It’s github was created on November 30, almost 4 months after the hard fork. There’s another coin called Brian cash they were claiming was bcash at one point that’s been in development for awhile but I can’t find it’s github now. Anyway, that sub is literally the conspiracy subreddit for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:43:21
Right. The GitHub was created on November 30, and its inactive twitter started posting in December. And, you guessed it, the lead bcash dev is a fan of bitcoin cash. Either ver/whoever is just not trying very hard, or someone else is doing these things so poorly to delegitimize Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:19:15
Right I agree with everything you said. I'm just saying the same can be applied to blockexplorer. Are they really doing this based on their beliefs, or are they being influenced by a major bcash player? 
We'll never know and I hate speculating about this shit because there's so little facts involved. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:03:44
I wouldn't be surprised since the bull run in ETH lagged behind the BTC run. There could be a stagnant/declining period like what happened with BTC, but this price correction changes everything imo. 
Edit word
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:36:37
I agree we shouldn't be exclusive and toxic, and in general with regular people I don't think we are. 
But when it comes to people like Jamie dimon, ceos of the banks which had a primary role in the financial crisis of 2008, the ridicule and exemption is deserved. Chase has been directly involved in Enron and Worldcom. There were over 10,000 suicide deaths associated with the 2008 financial crisis, yet fines and a few jailed for mostly blatant fraud, not misconduct. 
If I believed he sincerely changed his mind about bitcoin, sure. But he's probably just changing his stance now that chase is in a position that its beneficial to them.

@_date: 2018-01-10 14:29:38
I agree. From what I've experienced in this sub, I believe the general view is that ver et al. are the attackers, and both bitcoin and bcash users are the victims, with bcash users either being too dumb/ignorant to understand or against the grain to accept bitcoin becoming mainstream. Just what I think the general view is on this sub, not my beliefs. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:45:03

I think now they generally understand segwit is a soft block increase, or they changed their narrative which is now that segwit is evil code which increases the knowledge barrier for developers.

Diversify or trade crypto then. If you don't have time (I definitely don't) then just buy a few core ones like btc eth and maybe another of your choosing and hold. This might be the beginning of another dormant period for crypto, but if you're converting your btc gains to other cryptos then you're not really eating the cost of buying at near ath's. E: grammer

I'm not saying they're right, in fact I think they're wrong for the reasons you stated. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:48:55
I agree with you completely, it makes me worried since I don't hold anything but BTC. If the drop we are seeing is from investors dropping out, Bitcoin better work out its problems before those investors jump back into crypto. 
E: I guess the question we should be asking is if another cryptocurrency surpasses Bitcoin, will there be a use for bitcoin anymore? If you can use another crypto for quick and easy small and large transactions, then what's the point of using Bitcoin? Because it was the first? Just look at Netscape and Internet Explorer. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:08:48
Lightning is a reason bcash supporters hate core, because in their eyes the smart contracts don't ensure you own the money, and are more vulnerable to attacks. I guess it's slightly true in a way, but without smart contracts we're left with a strictly peer to peer system where trust is needed to ensure someone will give you what you're paying for. E: changed bitcoin to core

And the lightning network is p2p as well, just off chain. All I was saying is that bcash supporters don't see it that way. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:18:46
Those are centralized entities which are getting hacked. I don't think I've ever heard of an individual getting hacked when there wasn't an exchange/pool miner involved. The point of decentralization is to make it incredibly hard to hack and corrupt the ledger, and trusting an unregulated asset with a centralized entity is risky. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:24:53
I can see what you're saying, but this is a good problem to have. Bitcoin has historically been extremely useful for transacting money safely and relatively privately, with no restrictions bar the cost. If I want to send a million dollars to someone in another continent or to an unstable or corrupt country, bitcoin could be a safe way to do that. You might lose money in the process from price fluctuation, but so does any company or person using multiple currencies in their ordinary course of business. 
Bitcoin is still a great tool to use in situations such as these. If one is worried about transacting when price is so volatile, then stop accepting it like Steam did. International wire transfers are around $50, but the bank has your money and a record of who you send it to. Right now we are trying to make it usable again for small transactions, which I think is a great problem to have rather than dealing with a giant hack or scandal.

My understanding is limited and probably outdated, I thought an attack on lightning would require less work than an on chain attack. The following problems you outline are interesting, all I am saying is that  bcash supporters have claimed that lightning isn't truly p2p or as secure.

I was told this at around 3500 when bitcoin dropped from 5k to 3k, by somebody who shorted bitcoin. A crash will certainly not be fueled by early investors, and I'd be devastated if it was. 
Any early investors who have held this entire time have probably cashed out enough to be set for life, and understand the technology and fundamentals well enough to know its merit. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:41:23
I did my math wrong and only spent around $70 in fees, but it's still like 5% fees. I'd buy some on coinbase and once you're comfortable maybe move to Gdax and just do market buys on there. Once youre comfortable with market buys you could try limits and stops but it's up to you. Gdax isn't that difficult to learn and there's low purchase fees and no transfer fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:36:58
Something like this would need a third trustworthy party to be involved in a multisig transaction, which that centralized trust is what bitcoin is trying to get away from. 
Still a good point, but in order for there to be a true guarantee of a charge back, an independent third party has to be involved.

I would agree with you if Alts were rising while bitcoin was falling, but everything is going down right now. The news that bitcoin is now slow and expensive is causing all cryptos to slide. For example, in 1982, cyanide was put into Tylenol bottles in Chicago and 5 people died. Johnson and Johnson stock went down 33%, and other pharmaceutical stocks dropped by double digits as well. 
A relatively small and insignificant event for most companies which was highly publicized caused a bloodbath in that industry. Same thing here. I just hope bitcoin fixes its issues before people want to buy back into crypto again.

I agree completely, most of my wealth is in my 401k. The guy above me though has a terrible misunderstanding of what holding means, so I was trying to draw a comparison between holding crypto and your 401k. It’d be advisable that most people hold their crypto/stocks through dips, corrections, and recessions. With crypto I suggest taking profit occasionally because it is so volatile, but according to the guy I was replying to that means panic sell.. 
Haven’t been on this sub in a while, of course I forgot that you have to stay away from conversing with normies and shills because they don’t want to have a discussion or understand how any of this works. They’re just here for reddit karma. Not talking about you, but the week old account I tried explaining basic themes of this sub to.

Edit: All I was trying to say is that it’s advisable that most don’t touch their crypto/401k during price swings. However, if you have the balls to act on those price swings to make more money then why not. I know I wont be unless we see another extremely overvalued market like in late 2017. Was just trying to emphasize smart investing does not equal panic selling like your comment suggests

To be fair most newcomers came for the money due to main stream media coverage, not the beliefs or underlying technology. OG sounds idiotic but OG maximalist means something different altogether.

They hate on it and then don't give a clear suggestion of an alternative. Gdax has been very reliable until yesterday, and coinbase is perfect for new people. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:35:10
Oops yeah they are the same company, I worded that weird. 
Not sure if this is what you meant by what's the difference, but I'll add it anyways: Coinbase is much more user friendly with high fees whereas GDAX has very low fees in exchange for being more complicated and requiring identification. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:55:42
You probably won't get a logical answer on this sub. Just research the technology and you'll convince yourself. To put into perspective how big a deal bitcoin is in regards to cryptocurrency in general, its dominance over others is at 61%. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:02:37
No problem, back when I started I didn't know GDAX existed and spent about $200 in fees on coinbase until I found out. 
GDAX is really not that complicated if you use the market option, and its a lot cheaper. Just be careful with limits and stops. If you want more info just let me know. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:10:54
I was talking about yesterday when the websites crashed and nobody was able to buy/sell at the prices they wanted, and that's what spurred the recent increase in coinbase criticism. I guess liquidity isn't the most appropriate word for that

People have always hated coinbase, while disregarding the fact coinbase is part of the reason for the uptick in new bitcoin investors. The recent outrage is because people were upset they didn't have liquidity, which should be an acceptable risk for anyone holding bitcoin at the moment.

For those that remember the real reason this sub exists. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:17:27
They might be able to prevent/ban businesses from accepting bitcoin as payment, but the current government sentiment towards crypto is to let it continue to develop rather than kill it in its growth stage (in the US at least, I can’t say for Canada). 
It would also be impossible for them to increase the amount of the bitcoin supply, since a majority of nodes must agree to increase supply. If the supply was doubled, that would mean the value per bitcoin would halve. Any increase to the supply would cause a decrease in price, and a majority of nodes would probably not support a supply increase for this reason. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:15:13
That’s a system that is controlled by the government, a centralized body with significant control and influence. Bitcoin is decentralized and is collectively controlled by the nodes supporting the network. In order to do what you’re suggesting,  the “government” must first obtain enough computing power to perform a 51% attack, an action which would meet significant resistance and be nearly impossible to do anyways. You’re comparing apples to oranges here. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:22:24
Haha never saw that one before. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:13:23
The message still stands. Anyone who got into crypto/bitcoin before September is still in the green. You simply cannot claim the “ship has sailed” for those who entered the space before serious MSM coverage.
This drop will separate those who researched blockchain technology and invested in a belief, and those who are simply trying to make money or are fearful of missing out. 
All of this is easy for me to say, I cannot truly speak for those who believe in the tech and bought in higher than the current price. But if they experienced what I did when researching the blockchain, it’s like taking the red pill. There is no turning back.

I think a better way to describe this would be that the intrinsic value of btc lies with the trust of a distributed, decentralized system. That’s because it can’t be attacked best at one point unless you’re talking about exchanges or other large crypto companies. There is also no central body controlling it or that can be manipulated/hacked, opposite to how most corporations and governments are today. Saying the intrinsic value lies with the individual person makes you sound crazy to someone uninformed about crypto. 
E: granted, the guy you are arguing with is either a troll/fudster/idiot, but in the future explaining it better wont feed idiots like dr. dingleberry as much. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:16:59
A full node broadcasts transactions on the network and supports the entire blockchain ledger, basically enforcing a cryptocurrency's  rules and what not.  This is at the cost of power and storage space on your computer since the ledger is always growing. 
You can use it as a wallet (account) to hold your bitcoin. Wallets that don't do these things are just called nodes. If you own bitcoin, you should read satoshi nakamotos white paper. It's only 8 pages and you don't need to fully understand it, but I would highly encourage a read through. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:00:37
