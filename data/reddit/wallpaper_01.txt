I had such a hassle getting my money out of Australia back to the UK. If it was just bitcoin there are no boundaries. 
It's a ways off yet as no where really accepts bitcoin. But I'd love to go travelling and not have to worry about currency exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:45:17
Pretty sure woz doesn't need the money...
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:55:29
Yeah unfortunately it does seem like they are trying to disrupt bitcoin. You need to get your coins off that site, they get hacked and you're screwed.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:07:27
I got that, but I don't think I've ever heard that being mentioned...
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:26:07
Maybe they don't find anything?
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:45:27
It's odd it has this worth. But it does make sense considering the amount of coins available. I wish it could be used as currency soon. We really need some stability. I can't buy a sandwich without worrying in 2 weeks I've paid twice the price... I can't use this as currency yet, which pisses me off!
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:32:44
Cheap? Is it? Cheap would be £200 again.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:33:38
I've had 2 exchanges go offline, mtgox and cryptsy with my funds on (very little luckly). I'd rather be in control of mine. But that does have its downfalls you are correct. 
I bought a nano ledger s. It just sits in my draw and is locked with a pin. Then that is backed up with a 24 word phrase on paper. If the house burns down it's gone, that's true. But is that more likely than an exchange going offline? Not sure.
It's all risk, I just feel I'm in more control this way.
Also the 2 step protects your login details, but if the exchange itself gets hacked or they go dark then you lose the coins.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:50:20
Ok, but does the person I'm paying need to be running a lightning node? Could I connect to a node now and send bitcoin using lightning to a non lightning user?
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:41:37
Is it possible for me to start mining and solve a block?
What are the chances of this happening?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:44:28
It's only been 30min since you invested! Try hodling for 4 years!
You get desensited to it all.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:20:41
Who ever said that?
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:51:24
How would a decentralised exchange work?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:01:54
Who knows!
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:02:48
For god's sake... I don't like the guy but are things like this really necessary? It all seems quite petty here at the moment. 
The funny thing is, I'd not heard of Roger Ver since using this sub, it's all I hear about now!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:38:35
Wtf was it 10?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:32:43
Well I mean a week ago it was 16k, so really it's not that bad is it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:34:10
Hodl for a few more years yet, whatever the price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:06
Exactly, some of the comments here are ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:33
I think there will be less and less people holding 1 BTC in the future. Times like this people sell it off.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:35:07
You could move to bitcoin cash, but Roger ver is still a dick.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:54:07
I've used it twice, very cool
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:12:41
This is not the fault of core though. Coinbase not upgrading to segwit is an issue.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:06:59
Percentage gains were probably higher for bch
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:57:20
How do the rewards work? I have one but cant seem to find info?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:21:15
No euros support?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:46:01
Yeah every thousand comes quite quick now. Every hundred before was celebrated now that's stopped. Next it will be every 10k!
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:46
Apparently it already is
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:06:58
Do gemini have an app?
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:35:58
I do get it, I've been here a while and participated in the whole thing since Bitcoin was $10. I just don't share the same beliefs any more as most do here.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:13:02
Segwit increased the blocksize, but it won't have much effect if bitcoin becomes widely used. There were not an enormous amount of transactions. That would barely register for Visa. There was a large amount for what Bitcoin was used to.
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:49:27
Not before segwit but potentially before lightning. But this is not proven yet anyway and there is lots of work to be done here. Will lightning hold up with Visa like numbers? We are told yes but we don't know until it gets use.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:46:32
I understand the concept. I've supported it for a long time, very long. Lightning network gives hope. But at the moment Bitcoin has been proven it's broken. So people should not get their hopes up that Bitcoin is going to magically rise to 100,00k. People are more savvy now. Hence what we are seeing. The Blockchain technology is interesting. I just don't believe bitcoin will be what people use as a worldwide currency. It's basically a gamble at this point to keep money in, which I'm not willing to risk anymore. 
In the beginning it looked very promising but we have moved on, there will be something that comes along which improves on th technology. I think most people here have a lot invested, so have a bias without knowing anything really about how it works. Seems more like blind faith at times. Most of the top posts here are memes, and quotes by rich people saying bitcoin will rise to 10 million dollars by 2021, very few interesting articles about the technology. People don't want to hear it but it's true.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:18:22
Been saying this for years. However, Bitcoin in its current state doesnt work anyway.
@_date: 2014-05-19 15:21:02
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:31:59
I'm sort of thinking the same thing, the media attention is growing, plus the fact that you can buy online without anyone knowing your name is pretty inviting to most people. 
I have 0.24 at the moment, but I will increase this, provided it stays pretty level for a while, then who knows... 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:16:34
I don't know why people think it won't drop to virtually nothing? There is no use for it. Large investors are manipulating people into thinking a price rise is happening, when actually it's happend so much, people are sick of having their money stolen. People are losing interest now the promise of a virtual currency doesn't seem to be happening. I'm not sure it will even recover much once it does get low.
@_date: 2014-05-21 09:59:34
Good news! 
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:11:34
Oh common... You are really nitpicking here. All those things are amazing, and would make it easier to buy things (Not that it is that hard now), and I find it really interesting how it works, even considering writing a paper for my Masters dissertation, but at the end of the day, if I put some money in now and it drops, I won't give a crap. Its not enough to be worried about.
But if it rises? Will I be happy? Of course I fucking will. I'm on this earth for the short amount of time to enjoy myself, a little extra money will not hurt me at all. I can tell people I was around at the near beginning and my transactions could have helped. I'm mining Doge, in the future this might not be possible. I am contributing. Get off your high horse.
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:41:10
This is pretty bad, could have happened to anyone to be fair, although I only use bitcoin-qt for my coin, I don't trust anyone else.
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:37:56
I agree, I see it being more used as well as, not instead of visa etc. 
I think the way to go seems to be whats happening, smaller retail outfits accepting it then maybe one day the big players will take notice, which means more adoption. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:49:57
Another classic comment in this subreddit. I love it here, so friendly. 
I forgot the 'ticker' on my browser was doge/btc not doge/usd. So sue me...  
@_date: 2014-06-24 15:52:26
Transactions per day is clearly up on last year for starters. Look at the rise, this was when there was hype and everyone was buying/selling so its obviously going to be down from that. But overall its higher than 2013. Also there is a lot more subscribers than last year, it doesnt really matter about the rate. You can't join r/Bitcoin twice... But even so, looking at your graph, the average of users joining is, again, higher than this time last year.
There is no point in comparing the stats to a time when hype was high because obviously its going to look low, but overall, what you have showed me has solidified the fact that there has been growth since 2013. Bubbles mean nothing. 
For me, Bitcoin is a long term project which I do see mass adoption, but its going to take a very long time. The signs are there that its happening though.
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:09:18
Who keeps voting down comments? I know this is a Bitcoin reddit but the mere mention of another coin is allowed surely? The topic is still bitcoin. Childish.
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:09:01
Nice one, how long does it usually take? This will be very interesting to see if it actually will work. May the floodgates open!
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:40:22
Thanks both, that clears it up pretty good!
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:31:03
NEY! Moon is a bitcoin idea! Shibes are just taking the Michael.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:35:38
So when its syncing its downloading every transactions since the beginning of bitcoin? I wondered if with updates the history would be preinstalled on each version.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:24:32
Hmm no I wouldn't. I really regret not getting in at $10, I said to my house mate I was gonna buy 10 and he laughed, I knew barely anything about it then. Now I know much more and believe it will go higher than $1k. Im waiting it out because buying in now would be stupid, as soon as it starts to rise again I'm going in with a set amount of money i've set aside.
Not missing out again.
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:26:50
Maybe, I watching the price very close, if it starts to jump up again. I'll probably go in. No point now though, looks to be dropping a fair bit.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:33:19
Right well I clearly said I don't want to mine bitcoin but convert to bitcoin so its irrelevant. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:37:18
Or not...
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:26:51
Im not getting into this. I'm also well off. Clearly anything I say is going to get twisted. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 11:32:33
It was helpful to me, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 08:54:16
Yes it does, its been a while since ive done anything with crypto forgot how it works! thanks
@_date: 2014-04-03 11:40:01
Horse shit. Whats going to happen is its going to drop to $50 or less. Then bounce back up to $1000 when everyone buys in again, then everyone will sell and it will drop to $50 again. Rinse repeat...
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:29:18
Because its too much effort to be useful. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 10:59:44
I will defo look into this. Thanks. Probably won't go all in, but might go in yeah. I like the sound of cutting out cryptsy. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 09:59:53
Oh god I would love it if BTC went to $10 again. Missed out last time not missing out again!
@_date: 2014-04-16 10:06:26
I thought so too because of double spend but I got told by quite a lot of people the other day that it doesn't matter.
My argument was how can it be used if we have to stand there waiting for 10 minutes before we get our goods?
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:14:07
Forcing people to sell?
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:45:22
Yeah haha, they have not said anywhere they accept Bitcoin or allow the apps. But its pretty funny people going crazy and it seems to be raising the value anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:35:19
Yeah, this will happen for a long time until vendors can spend the btc on something 'they' need. Once wider adoption takes place, hopefully it won't matter about converting into fiat. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 08:40:50
I will watch this, currently at work at the moment so can't right now but thanks.
I'm not 'for' banks I just know that they are taking the stress away of managing my money. I'm worried about myself managing my own money, not getting hacked etc so for the technophobes this could be a nightmare.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:20:29
baah went in at the wrong time, at least im in! Drops to $10 and im going it with a lot!
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:45:03
keep playing it down, its fine but the fact is, its rising, just like you have said. More large companies are integrating into their shopping carts, its going to get easier for users. It won't happen overnight but it is happening.
Also, you can't really measure the 1000+ per day thing, every now and then there is massive hype. More people have Bitcoins this year than they did last year.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:23:09
Yeah ive seen sites like hasco.ws focus on the most profitable
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:06:49
Thats awesome!
@_date: 2014-10-14 09:28:37
This would be hilarious if its true. And it could well be...
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:38:46
People are mining though, why if its not profitable?
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:18:43
Yeah might do, I posted the other day and got a frosty reception...
@_date: 2014-04-16 08:28:38
I had this discussion the other day. I thought they were not but apparently they are. The confirmation thing doesnt matter and its the retailers that need to be informed on this.
I bought some food with Doge and had to wait for 3 confirmations till I got my food. Was kind of a buzz kill honestly.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:44:00
I'm not sure, but the point I go in I will not regret it. I'm waiting right now anyway. I still feel like its going to go down a bit. If it gains traction again I will go in.
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:48:52
I do understand this. I'm a network engineer and really love the concept and everything. I do believe this will take over normal currency. The other day I was having a conversation with my girlfriend about how we never carry cash anymore, we are moving towards it without even knowing. It will come.
At the same time, why should I not want to profit off it? At the end of the day thats why we are all here. To use it as a currency to buy stuff. People want to get as much value from a product as possible. Bitcoin has been around a few years and I thought I could ask here at the best time to get in, to get as much value for my money as possible.
If I buy in, and in the future it rises so high and gets used by so many places I wont need to make money, it will be money...
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:46:28
It was useless as a payment system once more than a, let's face it, quite small amount of people started using it. Transaction costs were high and very very slow.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:30:42
No, but the dollar is pretty well established, surely bitcoin needs to be spent to be recognised as a currency? Plus people don't save dollars in the hope the price rises then sell their dollars??? They save them to SPEND them.
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:41:06
This is probably the the most hostile/unhelpful subreddit ive come across. No wonder the coin is going down... 
Thanks, to all that gave me serious helpful responses. The rest...
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:08:24
I do like this but IMO Facebook would need to integrate this for everyone for it to catch on and it not be third party.
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:00:43
Thanks, im trying to mine scrypt as llong as possible before the asics come in, then going to throw some money in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:38:44
I feel for those people now...
@_date: 2014-02-02 16:02:48
Quality video, so excited now!
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:08:46
Yeah not that much, take it you can only mine bitcoin with that then?
@_date: 2014-06-24 09:53:43
I understand your point and you are correct. But at the same time incorrect as it could quite easily go up in value. As more people adopt, the more rare it will be for users to have 1 BTC, driving up the price. Its pretty simple. 
It just depends on adoption, and right now it seems to be going up.
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:46:44
Thats a good idea ha, going to do this I think.
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:42:31
Thanks for the help, will give it all a look. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:20:36
That would be idea yeah. I love bitcoin and there is a lot of information out there on it, almost too much. Do you think adoption rate would increase if there was a simple public information source? 
If I was your average shop owner I wouldn't have a clue about bitcoin. Im a techy and im still not 100% on all of it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:56:54
Would he not just deny it also if he is as clever as the developer said? Would he hell say no longer involved...
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:39:13
ahh, no its fine! People started voting on it before I could change it so thought screw it and left it.
@_date: 2014-04-12 11:19:05
I have more bitcoin than dogecoin. Am i not allowed both? What's with the attitude? 
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:11:22
Thats not true. A ton are.
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:53:57
Excellent man! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:58:48
hmmm someone has to be! Using his real name could be legit because he maybe never foresaw it growing like it did.
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:18:03
Im mining doge cos its easy, but was going to sell up my rig once asics come and buy bitcoin. Honestly its all a gamble.
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:10:58
Maybe so, but in 28 years my bank has never 'lost' my money, which I could. And I have a feeling if my bank did have problems they would be covered by insurance. Not certain on that though. But yes I do have a lack of info.
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:09:38
Correct, I just posted the article and they claimed they were first. Maybe they mean UK? Anyway, good this is starting to happen.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:51:34
Shit, my ssd wont take that! Suppose it doesnt matter until I need it. More sites i'm using are starting to accept btc so in a few years it should be pretty exciting
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:40:26
WHAT?! Did he invent it? Or has he bought the Bitcoin company?
@_date: 2014-04-04 09:33:16
Well im not. It just seems this is what probably going to happen. People only seem to be interested in investing and not using it so this will happen. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 09:23:29
I aware of banking issues, to me im not really affected or not aware that im affected. If I looked into it im sure I would be annoyed but to be honest a lot of people simply dont care. 
This is what im saying, I think Bitcoin needs something that the average person will be taken to, at the moment I cant see why the average joe would switch or even use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:23:45
I don't know who this guy is, but from a Google search he is a Bitcoin investor and seems to know a lot about it. Probably more than me.
Which begs the question, how did he get hacked? My little 13 year old brother knows to keep the Bitcoins in cold storage. The best hacker in the world could not gain access to this.
Honestly, I can't feel sorry for people like this. Things like this just show the world is not ready for Bitcoin. As much as reddit Bitcoin complain against banks, it takes the responsibility away from people looking after their money. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 16:03:09
Yeah true, I will invest just what I waste each month is probably the idea
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:36:33
Great post! I was treated like shit when I came here asking questions. I'm going to treat others how i'd like to be treated.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:43:45
Every time I make a post there is some dickhead smart arse comment, so I stopped doing it, this sub reddit is the worst I've come across for it.
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:50:39
Haha yeah true, hopefully it will go up then!
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:34:06
You pro! Wish I could get that much...
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:26:11
Goodness. I suppose if you cash out now and it goes lower you can rebuy and get some money back if it goes back up.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:06:17
There is nothing wrong with extra interest. Bitcoin is not an exclusive club, I can ask these questions if I like, the more interest the better id say.
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:55:46
Thanks, so its really the merchants that need educating and not the buyers. As a buyer I dont care I just dont want to stand there for ages.
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:02:18
Would be interesting if it dropped to nothing. There would be a buy frenzy and it would start all over again!
@_date: 2014-04-16 10:59:23
Yeah I'm aware of this, which is why im asking what the positives are. Im not trying to be difficult. I just want to know what its offering me over the current system. For people who want to buy shoes from Iran, or hemp seeds, or pay $10 to a cousin that lives abroad, bitcoin sounds great. But how many people do this on a regular basis throughout their day? 
If this is what bitcoin offers over the current system I cant see it being widely adopted. It needs to be on a lower level on this. Remember you NEED to think of the average person, not people with specific needs. Bitcoin already provides a way for people to deal with those issues above but yet its still not widely adopted.
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:25:16
Its peaked for me. I used it for a while but for the individual, there is no reason to use it. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:43:31
Honestly, I think people are just getting bored of Bitcoin. When it was cheap it was fun. Then it got serious, so much so that most people couldn't afford 1 coin. Then there was so much moon talk people got fed up. 
Most people can't afford to buy Bitcoin, we need to concentrate on real life. Why change your money to Bitcoin, to then buy something you could have bought already with fiat? Its an extra step.
Honestly I got bored, I can't be the only one. Other reasons will affect it, but that's my take on it...
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:45:14
Shit unlucky man. Well I got 1btc and spent it, was debating to buy 100! But a few people I know said it was stupid and too risky. It was risky but in life you probably should take risks sometimes. Even if I had lost it all and bitcoin vanished at that time I had $1000 and just spent it on a crappy holiday. Totally regret it but im hoping in the future I can look back on this and think yes!
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:47:06
I wouldn't worry about Yahoo readers. EVERY article, doesn't matter what its about has about 90% idiot/racist/sexist comments. I read Football news on there and the comment section is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 08:35:24
Who said they don't want it? The more options the better surely?
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:36:04
Thanks, good plan. I will try for 0.1 each month, provided it stays similar price. I just waste the money on other crap anyway. 
My mum actually gave me £53 to buy her 0.1 haha! My girlfriend thinks its a load of rubbish and wont invest... I told her my finger was on the button to buy 10btc 12 months ago and look at it now, but no... Suppose thats the majority of peoples reactions to what they dont understand...
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:59:49
Yeah saw that, but once the asics come in they are going to clean up. Then 5 billion a year can only be mined per year, seems like loads but depends on hashrates and difficulty, might not be.
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:26:48
Even my cat knows you use Bitcoin to buy things and Facebook is a social media platform...
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:02:41
Thats it keep dropping! Go back to $1 please so I can get on the train this time!
@_date: 2014-02-03 13:12:52
Haha true, my instinct last time was sort of based on an educated guess, I know more about tech than the people who told me not to do it, so probably should have gone with it...
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:41:12
Ah ok not sure, take it after its installed its a massive file?
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:01:27
lol yeah going down. Glad I didnt get sucked into this fad...
@_date: 2014-06-13 08:52:02

I have a lack of knowledge on this, but could they just not use simple limits? Like limit the power or users signing up?
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:27:29
Im not talking about altcoins. Im talking about bitcoin, which is what i ultimately want
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:52:38
Exactly! I find it really fascinating, but there is literally no point at this moment in time using it. Obviously people will say if we keep using it and driving it forward, it will become more user friendly in the future. But I think there needs to be more incentive now. I work in networking and to be honest I found it a bit confusing in the beginning, god knows what my friends and family would think?
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:53:28
What makes you think I'm a newcomer? I'm not insulting people on this thread, they have been really helpful. But every post I make on here there are some rotten eggs. More so than any subreddit ive seen. I don't know why this is? Everyone starts at the bottom, you learn from others. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:33:48
Sorry typo...
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:24:41
Exactly, considering he looks like he knows about it all. How could this possibly happen?!
@_date: 2014-04-11 10:52:29
Thanks, im not disputing anything. Basically im paying for some food at a shop it takes 10 seconds I have my food. Will this happen with bitcoin? Because I bought some food with doge in london and had to wait 3 confirmations before I got my food. Was about 4 minutes but still... 
Something needs to change doesnt it? The merchants need to or the pay system, something?
edit* Also whether it takes 3 days behind the scenes for my creditcard to clear does not concern the consumer. At point of sale it takes seconds.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:00:53
I will give that a look thanks. Are we likely to see the same trend this year? What triggered it?
@_date: 2014-04-08 07:44:21
Im pretty new to all of this and have been recommended numerous wallets from people. But my gut instinct is to use bitcoin-qt, encrypted. I feel like in 4 years I could come back and my bitcoins would be safe using this wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-11 08:34:35
But doge didnt drop the last few days though?
@_date: 2014-05-19 12:51:56
They are idiots, how is Bitcoin and Facebook related?
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:39:54
Well I'm just saying, when I get my wage I spend it. If I get bitcoins I save it incase it goes up then sell it. Sounds more like stocks than currency doesn't it?
To be clear, I'm not against holding to get rich, honestly I have some and hoping the price goes up too. I'm just saying, it doesnt feel like a currency at the moment. 
I wonder the first people who had dollars or pounds felt the same way in the beginning? Maybe. 
My hope is amazon or ebay start accepting it, the price sky rockets, then I can spend it like I would my $. I just wonder if it will get to this stage or how we can get to that stage? One of these companies taking a chance I guess. Will they want to set up accepting bitcoin if people are too afraid to spend it? This is why I said doge is perfect at the moment. People are not scared to spend. Places are likely to accept doge because people will spend it.
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:33:36
Thanks thats the clearest I've seen it laid out.
As for Dogecoin. Its got the same amount of chance as any other coin does it not? I'm not saying it will go higher but it seems to be used as a currency more and more. In my opinion people need to spend it for it to be adopted and it doesn't look like the bitcoin community want to do that with the fear that it might rise once again...
How can it be a currency if people don't buy things with it? At first this is what was happening, as with doge.
@_date: 2014-04-16 08:44:47
Yes maybe. I know bitcoin is a virtual currency but to me it feels like fiat is becoming virtual more and more anyway. I rarely carry coins or notes around now. So I think bitcoin needs to advertise the advantages and maybe provide more consumer friendly methods of storing/spending etc.
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:04:28
Yeah i did think that, feel like its gonna take off. Im mining that currently.
@_date: 2014-04-04 09:32:08
If they have it maybe they should have a policy to stop users being screwed over too.
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:36:46
Can I ask about this. I have just been storing my wallet on a pen drive. Why would I need to do anything with PK? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:51:30
Shit, my ssd wont take that! Suppose it doesnt matter until I need it. More sites i'm using are starting to accept btc so in a few years it should be pretty exciting
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:31:56
This is interesting thanks. This Finney attack sounds worrying, some people could double spend.
@_date: 2014-06-23 10:00:26
You have it bang on, something that the mass market wants that can only be bought with Bitcoin needs to happen. We need someone like 50 cent to step up. I think PayPal could be the first step towards this. The guy who owns eBay has Bitcoins and hinted PayPal using it. This will get your average person at least interested I think and the UI could be easier for people to get.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:18:06
Really? Used a calculator and it seems more profit mining. But would like someone to comment who does it first.
@_date: 2014-06-24 09:50:34
I hope this happens, I'm too lazy and scared to convert back to £, I'd rather just spend BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-04 10:55:01
You getting much?
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:37:06
I just don't understand telling people to hold? How would that help anything? Surely if everyone did that the value would be 0? 
Why doesn't the infrastructure support widespread adoption? Genuine question by the way, I'm just looking at all this from a consumer point of view.
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:10:20
True that. Why is it going down so much?
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:13:50
Yeah its an unknown, just want the best value for my money obviously. Its pretty exciting being around at the beginning, looking back in 10 years will be amazing.
@_date: 2014-04-11 08:18:30
Its dropping. I bought a couple of days ago and its gone down loads, think it will drop further so im transferring my coins to doge then going back in when it settles.
@_date: 2014-04-07 18:50:51
Thanks friend!
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:57:15
I was going to buy at $10 last time but failed to see its potential and knew little about it except I needed one coin to get access to a site.
If it went to $10 I would watch my ticker and buy after it rose a significant amount say from $10 to $17. But yeah obviously I'd wait to see if it hit $1. Why not!?
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:02:31
Essentially, it hopefully will be a currency thats widely used. If I mined I would use a pool, I am interested in it but I wondered if I would get a return on the hardware. I gave it a go in a pool with my cpu and was getting something but clearly not much.
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:16:10
I'm no genius or anything but isn't the problem that no one is spending their coins and everyone is holding? 
People seem to use this coin only to get rich, it doesn't seem like a currency to me. More like people holding onto an important football jersey or something hoping that in a few years it will be worth something.
The people in dogecoin seem to have a more promising future, seems to be used more as a currency.
Amazon will not implement it into their shopping cart if people are too scared to spend it, in case they 'could' get rich...
I'm probably wrong, but thats the way I see it.

Just thinking ahead a few years, will electrum be still functioning? I like the sound of a paper wallet, that way if the system changed it would be fine.

Yeah true true, may do that, was looking to experiment anyway and my pc is getting old, could do with a gaming rig! Cheers for the info.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:25:15
Yeah you say that, but you cant compare bitcoin to xbox which is already established and extremely successful. 
Bitcoin I'm almost sure that 90% of people in my town have no clue what it is and the other 10% probably hardily have a clue how to use it. I think the end user deserves a voice as ultimately they are going to shape how its used and if its successful. YES people are making it better and making the code safer but its the mass market that will blend it into something usable not the programmers and elitists. 
Im asking what can be done to bring it to mass market and what are the advantages, without discussion you will not get resolution. 
I've seen far too many comments from people in this subreddit that are up their own arses and think they know better than the new guys. Well wake up because its the public that know nothing about bitcoin which will determine its success.
@_date: 2014-04-04 10:47:45
Why? Pretty much every coin ive gone in from the start has started well and tanked. Ultimately isn't bitcoin probably the safest bet?
Its not always the best tech that wins, betamax/hd-dvd etc...
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:01:22
Oh yeah thanks for that! But surely people asking these questions helps to think of ways to make this happen? 
The Internet was just the same but without people looking to find ways to make it easier to use and more consumer friendly it would be nothing today. So I think its important we ask these questions.
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:20:11
Thanks :)
Yeah I totally agree, I'm only going in with what my computer is worth so not a life changing amount. If I lose it so what, but obviously I want my best value for money. Its looking like nows the time.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:25:19

@_date: 2014-04-16 08:56:59
I like this list, thanks :) 
Now I just think it all needs to be made more consumer friendly.
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:11:50
Its irritated me recently, I've posted the last 3 or 4 times and 99% are nice and helpful but there always seems to be a few people who seem to talk down to you. I've not encountered this on any other subreddit.
@_date: 2014-04-16 09:01:28
I have received hate on here mentioning alt coins such as doge. But here is a story.
I tried to get my friend into Bitcoin last year, they were not having it, too complicated blah blah, hackers... Anyway a few months ago I explained Dogecoin and they thought it was really funny and were willing to set up a wallet. I sent some doge and they loved it. Anyway turns out he now owns more bitcoin than me! So I think maybe both can use each other hopefully.
I do think the altcoin thing is a bit annoying now though, I mean on Crypsy there is so much. I think there is room for 10 or 20 but its taking the piss a bit with slothcoin etc... I think confusion could set in again if there are too many.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:05:52
How much is one coin now?
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:56:09
I'm at 0.7, I just want 1! 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:20:08
Say if i mined doge, it looks like a lot of profit
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:51:22
Thanks, a lot of hostile comments, was quite surprised. Been playing with a few cryptos but not spent any real money really. Im now going to, so wanted advice on the best time to go in to get the best value for my money. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:09:18
Yeah true. I think I will stick to around £50, not a big loss that way.
Its so strange, there must be loads of kids that are millionaires right now or have thousands. Wish id gotten involved last year or sooner when I actually found out about it. 
Learned a good lesson, that is to not listen to everyone else and just go with your instinct.

@_date: 2014-08-18 16:18:15
That's a good point! I hope this happens, I'm not saying I dislike Bitcoin or anything, I just have no use for it at the moment. Maybe in the future it will be easier and more efficient to use Bitcoin. I remember using PayPal for the first time, I hated it and couldn't understand. I imagine services like that will probably exist to make it easier.
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:54:17
Why is it revolutionary? Explain. Anonymity? Speed? None of these I need, everything is just fine for me at the moment. I don't need to be anonymous and I don't need my transactions to go faster. So what does it offer me and the rest of the world? 
I genuinely want to know.

I would cash out personally. Owning a house with no mortgage is like winning life. Even if Bitcoin skyrockets, you can only buy material things. I can tell you, even a fancy car gets boring after a month. He can remove stress from his life. But like some others have said, probably cash out half or even 3 quarters. Keep some coins just in case. That's what I'd do anyway. Everyone is different.

@_date: 2017-01-05 14:02:25
Yeah it's hilarious. The truth is, no one knows. There is demand for Bitcoin, so it won't drop to nothing again, but all these wild estimates of $2000 - $3000. It could happen, but it's just hope. There is literally no reason for this fast price increase so it's clearly a bubble. People saying it's different... It's not. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:46:50
I think a lot of people with that amount will sell up soon enough. More people will get into Bitcoin but have a lot less.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:32:35
That Mt gox thing was insane. I feel for people who got caught exchanging at the time, but people who used it as a wallet... Even before that, I kept everything on my own machine, backed up.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:59:12
Happening now!
@_date: 2017-01-04 08:25:56
Yeah won't be that long. Sooner than 2030. Once the price goes up towards 2000 people will sell up. Then it's hard to buy back in.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:52:15
What if Bitcoin never gets used as money to buy things and just has a value based on how rare it is and people wanting to keep it?
I see less posts here now about websites accepting bitcoin than I did 3 years ago. 
It does worry me a bit, where is it going and what's the point of it? It's got potential to be a currency anyway. The last few months have been a step in the right direction.
I believe from what people have been saying, that lighting network should enable fast transactions. That's definitely a step towards currency. I do like how you can send money across the globe, very cheaply and it still be the same currency at the other end. 
How the average person will deal with bitcoin, I don't know. I can see a lot of bad press if this goes viral. People will lose their wallets, left right and center. The general public are stupid. Once the network is strong and ready. We need some serious UI enhancements and simple backup methods.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:44:01
I don't see anything wrong with this. Some reason finally when there is so much bullshit flying around.
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:27:55
I wonder if the price shoots up. How many people will have hodl? Can't be many Bitcoin millionaires now from when it just started out.
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:50:59
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:55:06
I'm quite sceptical about Bitcoin to be honest. But a couple of decades, based on how quickly its grown to this point seems a bit long? Especially at the rate technology advances. If its going to work, I'd say 5 years.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:03:08
Do people use bitcoin to actually buy anything now?
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:57:44
It's going to drop again. I'll buy, then sell again when it goes up. Repeat.
@_date: 2016-12-23 10:11:23
Yeah I can see this happening.
@_date: 2016-12-05 11:38:48
Can't see bitcoin working. I believe we would have seen it take off already. I believe in a few years, someone like Apple, Amazon or Google will create their own currency. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:23:26
That's not really the point. I don't think suddlenly everyone is going to jump from VISA to Bitcoin. It could be positive as in, no central point of failure. Which is a Bitcoin advantage for sure.
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:18:55
£4 to go...
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:58:03
It was thoughtful. Reason being I've been up to $1000 and back down again the last time this happened. I just didn't happen to write my thoughts here. The percentage gains and losses were much greater than now, so I don't see this as the bottom.
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:50:14
I'm not selling until everyone uses bitcoin. But at that point you won't need to sell you just use it. It didn't take long for android pay and apple pay to get widely used. I know its not the same but its payment technology. Bitcoin just needs to be quicker and more user friendly. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:23:52
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:15:24
You may have cashed out on the rise to $100 though. I'm pretty sure I would have, if I'd bought hundreds of bitcoin for nothing. I bought 1 bitcoin for $10 and remember thinking, should I buy 10? Anyway I got back in at $300. If you get in now, chances are in 5 years your bitcoin will be worth much more at this rate.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:37:23
If you have your coins in bitcoin core wallet, then am I out of luck?
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:57:51
Not here we are, there is still a long way to drop. We could see it go below $1000 again. I'd say that's a good time to buy.
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:52:47
Can you use a mobile/cell phone number or is it limited to local with area codes?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:49:17
I don't think it will reach that. My prediction is $30k. I wouldn't be upset with that!
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:05:30
Ahh so buying another is pointless?

@_date: 2017-11-02 10:50:42
I had 10, now gone, and was about to buy 100, but couldn't justify £500. Anyway, I mined a load which are gone now. 
I do think about it, but really, how could I have known it would do this? I'm sure in 5 years it could be £100,000 or more. 
There is more to life than money, that's all I'll say. When I was younger I wanted to be rich. Now I just want to have no debt, and a little money to spend at weekends. I don't think having millions is all its cracked up to be. I know some rich people and I would not say they are any happier.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:07:21
Fantastic! I know a few rich people and they are not the happiest of people. I think its best in life to have no worries about money, rather than be rich. That's the goal for me anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:40:57
Id love to see an anonymous chart of this subs bitcoin holdings. Im going to guess about 70% don't have 1 bitcoin now.
That's probably what's pushing the value up so much. People trying to hit 1.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:03:14
Go in now. Even if it does go down, it will come back up. I bought in at £200, it went up to £800, then crashed back to £200. Resisted selling and its sky high now. No mass adoption yet. Get in now.

I've messed about with ALT coins and made virtually nothing. The only one I regret is ETH as I thought that would go the same way too so pulled out. 
You need quite a lot of money spare and do a lot of research, you can then make money on them. Otherwise I'm sticking to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:33
A month ago it broke 5k went up quickly then dropped right down. Won't be long before it's back up

Yeah I don't think many will hodl to that point though. I know I won't.
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:39:22
I think it will survive. But maybe with people unwilling to let it go. Something better will come along soon.

You can get debit cards now to spend the BTC. Not sure how it works. Think you deposit BTC to the card, then it gets converted from USD to BTC at point of sale. Allows you to buy anything.

@_date: 2018-02-03 11:49:28
Yeah it keeps spiking back up. Next week will be a new low. Wouldn't be surprised if it bottomed out at $2000.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:33:32
Was really hoping the price would stay the same until coinbase upgraded to segwit. Now the media hype begins and loads of new users come in to clog up the mempool again. 
Then they complain about transaction times and high fees etc... 
Price spike and drop once again. Come on coinbase, get your shit together! 
I mention coinbase because that will be how most new adopters get in.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:46:06
It's not so easy though. Many times have I got out, only for it to start rising again. The stories of people who got rich in bitcoin are mainly people who stayed in and forgot about it. In 3 years time it could be over $30k. It could be $300... If he actually stays in, which I doubt, he may end up with a lot of money one day. Most people here who react to the market, buy and sell, never really make too much.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:05:59
I was using TenX but VISA blocked it, not sure what's going on now.

Do they?
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:35:24
This would be much better. The bitcoin network can't cope with a massive influx at this time. We need more segwit adoption and lightning to support all the new users.

@_date: 2017-10-31 14:20:57
Ah ok, yeah noticed some selling a lot of coins at a lower price, then the overall price drops. Once those have been bought, the price returns.

Waterproofing isn't a gimmick. I work outside in England. It's quite useful actually and is pretty much rained here every day the last 2 months. Iris scanner I can agree with though.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:51:50
Even if you sell, someone is there waiting to buy it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:40:42
Is it high though? In a month do you think it could be 7k? Could easily be.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:38:58
Yeah but he doesn't know if he has bitcoin on there. So spending 2500 isn't exactly an option is it?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:41:24
Maybe don't buy a house with them, and use them for shopping or buying things? Don't think that would get flagged up.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:40:44
Lightning network will likely make it the best coin. Most other coins will vanish I suspect.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:26:21
Not really, he can spend the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:49:33
Nice cheers
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:58:19
This is because people stopped putting money into it and trading . Nothing to do with segwit.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:33:41
Yeah I'd quite like to know this. The update from tenx was bizarre. Wasn't clear at all.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:18:51
It worries me that you need to update them, how can you trust the updates are legit? With a usb stick, you don't need to update them. I didn't realise you could spend from a trezor actually. Thought they were for holding. Would you have a second means , like a backup to a trezor?
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:55:23
I'd say, from now its going to be hard for someone to own 1 BTC. I bet most people on this sub own 1 or more though. Would be good to have an anonymous survey.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:47:49
Why dont you just use coinbase? Pretty sure I had money sent to my uk account from them.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:43:23
Exactly, what a stupid post.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:20:55
Yeah, I've still got BTC in the wallet, but might get it out now.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:35:20
Technically he didn't lose anything, he has the same amount of bitcoin now that he did a few weeks ago. He only loses if he cashes out.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:24:08
I know, my recieve address has not changed yet so assumed they have not started.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:09:05
It's deleted so I can't read what it said!
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:42:55
People buying in I think. Think its at an ATH this second.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:47:54
Where you looking at that from?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:30:25
Isn't that what lightning network is for though? I don't think it's an investment, BUT if it becomes widely used as a currency, there are only 21 million coins. So their value will increase.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:36:11
5 years is a long time. If scaling works, lightning is successful, then it's not that unrealistic if it takes off. 
The only issue, how can it ever be used as a form of currency with the ridiculous price increase? More like stocks and shares really.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:53:50
So a bid is someone buying into bitcoin for USD and an ASK is selling bitcoin for USD, Which drives the price down?
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:01:27
I've noticed the Red in the asks column get eaten up. So if someone is selling 50BTC, it starts to drop as the buys come in. Once it clears the 50, the price seems to rise. Pretty interesting!
So right now there is about 50BTC to get bought before it goes much higher. A lot of BTC selling. But also a lot of small amounts of buying. Its blowing through the 50!
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:36:57
Downvotes but here we are at a new low... No one wants to hear it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:56:14
Will that really make a difference?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:09:27
Oh really? When I looked I didn't think you could. Easy enough?
@_date: 2018-07-22 08:59:13
Maybe that will be low in the future. Everything feels quite positive lately.
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:59:13
Feel like 36m is quite low. Bet tons of people own at least 1m in property.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:01:59
What a load of shit. Bitcoin is a payment system in its early days. Maybe try not talking about the value and more about what it's actually used for. The price is irrelevant. The fluctuations in price are unfortunate for its actual use.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:50:41
Is a trezor better than owning a usb stick? Feel like there is more to go wrong with a trezor and it costs loads more. I was thinking of buying 2 USB sticks with the wallet.dat and private keys on.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:12:18
Even if it was true, gold is something we place value on because it's pretty and shiny. It has just as much practical use as my sock. Actually my sock is more useful.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:34:25
Congrats buddy, the ledger nano S is a great purchase. I've held Bitcoin a while but only just invested in this. Feel so much better having done so. Having Bitcoin even on my computer scared me.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:00:39
Yeah, I had a miner going for a few weeks back in the day. Thing is, I have no idea if I mined a number of bitcoin because it was pretty much worthless. I do remember specifically buying 10 though for around £100, used 9.9 and left 0.1 in my wallet. Came back 2 years later and that 0.1 was worth £50. I remember thinking wtf, this can't be right?! Then see the price and yeah I felt a bit sick... 
I don't have much now, but it looks like the price could go up and up, so could have got back in at the right time. People will sell or lose them now too, so in 3 or more years we might be looking back on this moment.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:58:08
I'm always increasing my coin amount, regardless of its value.
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:51:32
Any time is really. I would just invest the same amount of $ each time regardless of the BTC price. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:25:03
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:04:30
Based on what? It could drop lower.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:40:58
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:39:34
No one will say how much they have. But I'm planning on holding until the value is higher then buy something I want. Probably won't convert it back to fiat now, no point.
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:28:46
He bases it on... He obviously has invested in bitcoin, so therefore it will rise to a number he is happy with. Nothing more. What a crock of shit.
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:59:22
I'd get them off coinbase anyway. If coinbase dissapears, you lose your coins.
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:31:18
Nah this is pretty much impossible to decrypt
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:56:16
This is a disgrace. I really hope segwit goes through.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:13:20
Don't be. I remember, and only bought 10 then sold them minutes later...
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:04:32
I don't think it is some how.
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:00:26
Which ones? There are hundreds. Even so, I buy in to them now, they fade to nothing like the rest. This is exactly what happened last time. Also, Bitcoin is actually useful.
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:28:16
I own 1BTC, from back when it was about $600. Just leaving it like you for years to see what happens. Its money I've forgot about now anyway. Would be nice to get to a point where I could start spending it and not have to convert it to dollars. Just like all those guys from the beginning who had thousands of bitcoins on their hard drives but forgot, they are now millionaires! 
@_date: 2016-05-29 19:53:41
Agree about the exchanges, if it reaches that amount I'll probably just buy things I need from quality retailers accepting bitcoin's rather than cash out. Actually, if other people are thinking like me, I guess the value will soar, so I'd probably hold even longer!
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:19:00
I'm excited, I can buy more in the dip now. Hope it drops very low :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:26:35
Nah I can see it dropping right down below $800.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:19:27
Hmmm, but what happens if it drops down to $300 again? Future doesn't look as positive if that's just repeated.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:24:15
Fix what though? What's wrong with the current system that needs fixing?
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:24:50
The rate it's dropping, when I wake up tomorrow it's at $1000
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:54:31
I hope this works out mate. Very risky as the price has gone so high so fast. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:01:37
I feel like this should happen now, divide 1 bitcoin into 100 bitcoin and let that be the standard. It's just going to scare people off.
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:10:10
Really? All the alts I bought in the past went to shit.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:21:35
Guess again!
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:35:00
I can't keep up. How will we have bitcoin cash, and how do we find it? I thought the original idea was to just hodl until it's all over?
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:43:37
No, no one knows what will happen. Could half.
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:02:52
Can someone explain why we are celebrating? Has Bitcoin improved?
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:22:16
I used to read all about them, some claimed great tech advantages over Bitcoin but faded away. Funnily enough, disregarding Bitcoin, the coin I've made the most from is Dogecoin. Its a popularity thing really and which gets marketed the best.
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:14:22
I think a massive reason also is usability. Let's face it, bitcoin is not at all user friendly. We need designers to contribute and not just tech guys. Bitcoin ATMs seem to be the wrong idea, ATMs will die off soon anyway, we need to be more innovative.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:12:15
If they make you a lot of money I bet they come out of cold storage!
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:06:11
Realistically, Bitcoin will fall first then gradually rise again. But I agree that it could be a shit show and not able to buy back in so easily.
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:17:10
Or, imagine being only able to buy a pizza again if the price drops... Literally food for thought! 
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:44:53
All those guys probably loaded now...
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:06:42
Yeah I agree, it's definitely sensible to hodl some.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:32:41
To be honest, I think it's going to get to a point where you won't cash out, and just spend the bitcoin on things you want.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:04:05
It's quite annoying. People direct you to pages that supposedly explain it all, but it's still confusing. I've not heard one clear explanation to be honest and there are so many conflicting opinions.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:11:56
I was thinking this. Might be best just to spend and buy things in bitcoin. Cash out small amounts each month so its fine. Although, if Bitcoin goes to shit, you would wish you had cashed out!
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:59:55
This, done this on another trading platform. You definitely don't hold Bitcoin. As this is the case, will this affect the price of Bitcoin or not?
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:25:34
I think it depends. Being rich won't make you happy. If you use BTC to pay of debt or buy a house. I think that's great even if the price sky rockets. Being financially comfortable would be amazing.
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:30:58
So is there a chance that it could happen before august 1st?
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:43:27
I was thinking this. Bet the majority of people don't even know about it.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:47:42
Yeah that's really not unrealistic, providing August 1st goes smooth...
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:46:34
Seems sensible. Seems unlikely the price will shoot up instantly on august 1st.
