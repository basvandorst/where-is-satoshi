Taxing a miner for the market value of a bitcoin when it is mined versus when it is converted to USD is pretty much retard-mode, and shows that the IRS has no idea how this system actually functions.
They may as well tax the thoughts in your head because in theory you could do the math for a near 0 difficulty cryptocurrency in your head and develop a private key in your mind without ever touching a computer or miner.

Nope, there wouldn't be any censoring to remove MtGox from a site that charts EXCHANGES.
MtGox is no longer technically a 'Bitcoin' exchange, as it is no longer possible to fluidly move Bitcoin through their system.
This was the same argument I used that got Bitcoinwisdom to remove btcchina.
If you're charting Bitcoin exchanges, and something stops being a fluid Bitcoin exchange, you have no obligation to chart it.

That's a pretty wicked valuation suggestion. I did the numbers on total world currency circulation, value stores, and the amount of active Bitcoin in circulation. Even with the best estimates, it would be hard to imagine Bitcoin taking over such a large percentage of international trade that it has a multi-trillion market cap.
I still believe there's a fine line between mass adoption and Bitcoin valuation, if Bitcoin's value relative to the USD inflates too quickly it will actually spur potential adopters away.
I wouldn't get on a blimp if I saw it was rapidly expanding, I'd probably keep my distance, thinking it was going to explode.
Businesses eyeballing Bitcoin as a payment option will tend to do the same.
If Bitcoin value drops, we have a pack of hyenas waiting to buy, newcomers that will get interested when they realize they can actually afford a decent piece of pie, and businesses that will believe people who shop in their price band will actually be using this currency.
There are a few things that will aid this.
**Positive publicity**
That's a good one.
**Mass adoption of the milli-bit as the keystone measuring stick for value, rather than whole Bitcoins**
Let's be honest, the $600 pricetag on a single coin is keeping a lot of people from hopping on board. If more of the Bitcoin market moved to the milli-bit standard, it may actually spur interest from people in these lower price bands.

Or this is just one of Bitcoin's numerous blow-off phases.
As someone who's been in since 2011...
I've seen it after stabilization that follows every bubble and precedes the next.
Pretty much all of 2012 was a blow-off phase for Bitcoin as a followup to the Summer 2011 boom.
What we're in right now is the followup to the November boom.
The time scales on the bubbles and blow-offs has not been consistent so I can't tell you the next time Bitcoin will move in one direction versus  another, but what I can tell you is I applied some basic math to about 2.5 years of Bitcoin's life and the only major trend is that it follows difficulty within an 80%+ correlation with outliers factored in.
Remove outliers and it exceeds 90%
Many argue that price drives difficulty, but I found a rubberbanding effect.
If the price is not following a difficulty rise for a period of about 1-2 months, there will be a forced rubberbanding of price to correlate shortly thereafter. No bubbles involved.
I theorize it happens due to miners not putting their new coin into the market immediately because of ROI concerns.

You have a great point.
If miners leave, then the hashrate declines and difficulty declines...
If the reward is negligible enough, miners won't be turning on hash power in an attempt to garner the reward, they'll be turning on higher hash power strictly in an attempt to gain 50% of the hash power and launch double spend attacks.
Given that the reward for competing miners to counter weight the person turning on 50% hash power is so low, other miners will no longer step in to stop this person, and the security of Bitcoin is compromised.
I will call this, the 'Grounding Point'
The Grounding Point is thus
The point at which hash reward is negligible, miners are leaving so difficulty is decreasing, and the reward for owning 51% of the mining power is greater than the reward to maintain the network and collect the block reward and/or transaction fees, and the effort to overthrow a miner attempting to own 51% is not worth exerting for the meager fees.
The Grounding Point is a real threat to Bitcoin.

Identity theft is getting easier and easier to track.
Let's say the thief made up a completely fake identity. They would have to have been very skilled with falsifying photographed documents, falsifying documents, or hire someone who could.
Now, they're intelligent enough to rip-off 300+ Million, so that's a seriously possibility.
Let's say they make a mistake though. Let's say they used a stolen identity. Stolen identities are becoming easier and easier to track and pin-point. If they got arrested on charges in this realm, but unrelated to Bitcoin, but MtGox says Person X,Y,Z was involved. Well someone claiming to be Person X,Y,Z looks very suspicious.
Let's say they took their verification photos with a camera, instead of a scanner.
If they didn't remove the exif data, that could very well reveal enough information to track them down.
Let's say they slip up post facto.
Someone traces something back to them, or they get loose lipped and decide to talk about their exploit.
There are many ways this person could slip. Very few paths lead to exodus for them at this point. With all the world's eyes looking at you, behind one of those eyes is someone more clever than yourself.

The data is always available in the MtGox API feed. Bitcoinwisdom won't 'miss' anything.
Bitcoinwisdom isn't "streaming" their API data, they're raw reading it.
That's why you can see historical data from before Bitcoinwisdom existed.
By this type of logic, I could start an "exchange" get a few thousand users, end up on Bitcoinwisdom, then disallow external transfers and game my own market to manipulate my pricing, thus manipulating Bitcoinwisdom's charts, and all of this is completely kosher and my manipulated numbers should stay reporting on Bitcoinwisdom.
In a nutshell, that's what MtGox has done, mind you whether it's malicious or not is irrelevant, the fact that the data has been manipulated whether it's malevolence or incompetence invalidates it.
