I am so glad I don't visit this sub anymore.

Not at all.
The one I'm looking for is much more technical, but just as useful. :)
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:39:08
nope.

As for this question, if you are referring to our service; we have a more elaborate system which involves analyzing your online/offline and onchain/offchain activity to determine if you're here or not. 
But the very basics of our system is, in fact, a sort of button^1 you have to press every x^2 time.
1. this is a metaphoric button, actually just a blockchain address 0 cost transaction    
2. This is of course, configurable, and pause-able (in case of vacation for example)

Hey homad, first of all, thanks for the feedback.


This is one of the main reasons we want this product as crypto users.
Before Legacy, I had a very complex system in place where I forced some of my relatives to memorize a long password that would open a encrypted database which I shared with them with a cloud service that itself contained some private keys.
If I ever modified these addreses, I had to push the file on the cloud and if I ever changed the password to that file, I had to tell them all (which was basically impossible). 
This has several problems; all people have access to everything, hard to modify, hard to remove someone from a list of trustees, etc...
I'm sure there are smarter people out there that did this in a better way, but we believe a smart contract is the best way to handle this situation.
What do you think?

I don't agree. IF that were the case, the current traditional businesses that do what we propose wouldn't exist. But hey, you're the first to react like that and so, thanks for the input.

As always, Felipe here with the team as well. If you have questions, just ask.

Even saying what you said is risky.

It's even worse. Faith is supposed to be blind.

Didn't he already address those concerns  in his previous comment?

Personal trust is not the same as third party industrial/corporate trust. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:23:09
I agree. Personal trust is not the same as third party industrial/corporate trust.

I'm building a service that does exactly this. We're launching in q1 2018.
