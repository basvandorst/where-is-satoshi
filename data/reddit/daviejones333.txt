Eh. Not so much a conspiracy as the could be "guardian angel" old timer keeping the market afloat. I've heard talk of long time bitcoiners that buy/sell in necessary btc numbers to keep the market as stable as can be.
@_date: 2013-03-07 13:46:47
You got out as in, sold everything you had? Does the condition of the market scare you that bad?
FYI, I'm not trying to sound sarcastic or find an opening to drop insult bombs. I'm asking sincerely. I want any and all perspective I can have.
@_date: 2013-03-09 09:07:21
That is so painfully true, I believe it is the sole reason I would never expect it. The world we've grown accustomed to is one of greed and paranoia. Guilt and regret. All because our dollars don't last(mostly anyway).
It would be amazing to watch btc banish that shit. It would be even more amazing still to help it achieve that goal.

If I buy, I intend to do just as you said. Get em, stash em, check the market later. I don't think the anxiety I feel is centered around putting money into btc, so much as it's centered on missing out on a potential life changing development.
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:06:55
This defeats the purpose of investing IMHO. Perhaps this would be a viable option for me once I get a decent amount of holdings, but to buy what I can then sell myself out seems a bit overeager.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:00:15
Correction: was thinking of another comment made on btc today. My second paragraph is my opinion, regardless of your personal feelings on it. Suck it up and share the damn info yourself if it concerns you that much. You think me a fool for having faith in something rife with uncertainty. I think you the greater fool for crying foul-play at the fact I voiced my outlook.
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:32:52
That's pretty much what I've been thinking. For all we know, we could buy in the short lull we may get, only to watch the bottom fall out. Or we could hold off and watch the price fly through the roof before we can buy.
I'm starting to think patience is the best policy at the moment.

I have not seen the video. Link?
I believe the market will hold true and the price will rise once these damn ASIC's show their face. I'm not holding my breath for that, but I'd rather be a step ahead as far as having some btc in my pocket when the jump hits than trying to scramble for whatever meager amount of btc I can find.
just my ฿0.0004727
@_date: 2013-03-08 05:46:34
I believe more people need to realize the importance of keeping the market moving. For example, my plan is to get a fair number of btc in holding, then keep a few for strictly buying and selling(a.k.a. playing the game). I think the economy as a whole would benefit from this because it would free up a good number of stagnant coinage, while continuing this burst of buying we've seen.
In the end, it would be a win win. Those that are holding keep gaining, and those that are wanting to buy in can actually buy(hopefully at a decent price).
EDIT: If we are truly working towards making this currency stick, we *cannot* hold our shares in white knuckled fear. This is what will cause the demise. We need to get this currency out and about. This cannot be done if everyone buys as many as possible and won't let go til the first person breaks formation.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:41:53
That's what boggles my mind. People were essentially screaming that it was a bubble when the price hit 60, then 70, then 80. When it hit 100, there was no doubt for those folks.
Now at ~250 and rising, I don't even know. I am almost sick with anticipation. It feels like a dream, but checking my files tells me otherwise.
What were we talking about again?

@_date: 2013-04-10 12:58:26
Sorry for the delayed response. Reality has been holding my attention pretty well lately.
I believe the people of the Earth are realizing that we do not need a government playing the role of an exasperated parent with us. This generation of twenty-somethings(which I am part of) and early thirty-somesuchs is shifting. Mentally, we have cut all but the most influental programs of our upbringing. We now see heavy resistance in nations across our world. We see policy change as well because this generation will not abide by the ways of old.
Some folks realize that we, as a human race, can do this. We can fix ourselves! We can cast off the burden of entrapment, trickery, fear, and hopelessness. We can, and I firmly believe we will, bring the self-serving hypocrites that claim to be of the people to their knees. How long must I watch my fellow man toil himself to death just to scrape by? How long must we be so lost in a selfish, paper money fueled shit storm, that we neglect the fact that we are missing our own lives...
Sometimes I think we will never outgrow it. But maybe, just maybe, I think too much...
@_date: 2013-08-21 17:14:23
I'm very inclined to believe this guy's article. Given the way our world governments have handled things, social and economic hardships of historic proportions doesn't seem all that far fetched. 
My advice? Start a garden. Learn to become self-sufficient in as many ways as possible. Batten down the hatches and hold tight. It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
@_date: 2013-03-05 03:57:57
Aside from strengthening the bitcoin economy as a whole, are they any gains for people that run full nodes(i.e. do we get a fraction of transactions/transactions fees)?
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:57:54
At the end of the day tho, it's all part of the game. Up or down, it matters not. The social contributions of bitcoin will outweigh any fiscal value thereof. I think we're in for a bumpy ride, if people are realizing what I believe they are.

Did anyone else see the ~1700 some odd btc transaction that stalled the plummet?
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:07:18
You mistake my full meaning of that statement. Do not assume to know my thoughts or plans. Simply because I am impressed by the ever growing numbers I own does not mean I fail to see the reality of the situation.
Your response tells me one of two things. You have sold the btc you once had, thinking the crash would happen long ago and now regret it, and/or, you believed btc was a joke from the get go and never bought any so now you can't help but be a salty dildo to those around you that had better sense. Sound about right? Yeaaaaah. I think I see your cheeks burnin...
@_date: 2013-03-12 00:10:55
Thus is the nature of bitcoin. You don't like the way someone does things? Do it better on your own. There is always another way and for that, we thank Satoshi. Or should we thank science and technology?
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:32:41
You have it right my friend. After printing out a paper wallet from bitaddress and loading a coin to it, your friend will need a wallet like the one you have(the one you sent the coin from). 
Since you have been using blockchain.info and have a fair understanding of how it works, perhaps you can direct your friend to [create an account]( 
Once that is done, you just need to select "Import/Export" and be sure to read the warning that pops up so you fully understand the gravity of your actions. Then proceed to type in the private key. The coins will be instantly transferred to the newly created(and hopefully secured) wallet that now belongs to your friend. The transfer will be confirmed after ~10 minutes. It is best to let any incoming coin achieve 6 confirmations(10 minutes for each) as this will ensure a proper, valid movement of coins.
[Here]( is a link to my preferred method of BTC storage. It has not failed me yet.

You assume I am the type that's more comfortable buying those badass sunglasses, or coughing up the same $ amount on dinner that I just spent at the grocery store. I'm not. I get the points you're trying to make, which are very good(and all too common now-a-days).
Based on the amount of money I throw away(this applies to anybody, really) on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, putting $100 into some sort of investment would be a big gain. Perhaps you think I'm looking for immediate gratification, or that I think I'll be rich enough to retire in a week. I assure you I do not dwell upon either of those thought loops. As mentioned in a prior comment(which thread it was in, I do not recall), I have sought an investment option and do believe I've found it.
It'd be silly not to take a chance and dump a bit o cash into this. After all, young men of generations past did the same thing with other "schemes", as I'm sure their peers loved to call them. Look at them now. The ones that aren't dead have more money than they know what to do with. The family of the ones that have passed probably never have to work again.
As always, I appreciate your input. Take care.

I can only assume they have something worked out since they're based in Japan. Given the way the Japanese culture fluidly adapts to/implements technology, I would be surprised if banks did not accept BTC, or at least that of a company like Mt.Gox. Heck, they may even have their own government providing a way...
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:57:17
My second paragraph never once mentioned btc. Methinks you're reading a bit too far between the lines. Are we reading the same comment at this point?
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:02:51
What happens if blockchain ever goes down? If every BTC to your name is stored in that system and you didn't print a wallet, what then? Given the value of a single coin plus the speed with which they're being bought, I would not leave it to chance.
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:44:45
Based on the rebound my charts are showing, market value is just fine, albeit it's back to Saturdays prices. The point remains. The panic selling seems to be rapidly balanced by those that are waiting for a chance to buy in at the lowest possible price. For all we know, this little dip in price just convinced people that were on the fence due to price to jump in. There is also most assuredly those that have sworn off bitcoin for good having seen such a disastrous looking event.
Bitcoin will survive as long as the community remains just that. A community. Working together to further the potential we all know bitcoin has. If we let a bit of a network hiccup tear down the cornerstone we've all contributed to, why bother putting any more effort into it?
My coins did not move an inch. Had my digital accounts not been dry of USD, I would have bought as many as I could afford. I believe and I am going to stand by bitcoin.
Your opinion is fine with me and I do not fault you for it. Just give me a heads up next time you're looking to sell ;)

As previously stated, the fluctuation in price alone isn't what shook me. I've watched btc climb since last year when I first caught wind of it. I have never seen prices drop $10 in literally seconds. It's a bit unnerving from a first timer buyers perspective.

I don't understand it either, honestly. I mean, yeah fine, miners get a pretty sizable reward for finding it, but it's essentially undercutting the market they're contributing to.

I was reading that thread as the plummet began, ironically. The thing is, I've got some money to play with, and have been looking at options for investing(mostly into the stock market simply for lack of a better longterm investing option). The wiggle room I have won't make or break me if it's lost(doesn't mean I won't feel it), but any gains it nets me will be a great success.

So long as those with true knowledge and trust in bitcoin stay at the helm, the corporatism u/shupack mentioned will never become so. Bitcoin will free us from the overmind. It will not simply till the ravaged soil of the old regime in hopes of a new plague arriving.
Keep the faith and realize the value bitcoin holds, for this will cause the shift we all want and need. Heed not the empty words of those in fear of losing control, for if you do, there is no turning back.

@_date: 2013-03-29 01:46:23
From my experience, the importance of an up-to-date backup far outweighs the short, minor inconvenience of replacing the old backup. If you value your coin, I strongly suggest keeping the most recent backup safe and secure.
If that doesn't quite work for you, perhaps a paper wallet would serve you better?
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:50:10

I've heard rumors that they're simply not trying to sell as many as they were in efforts to cut some of their loses(maybe they're waiting on market price to jump?). Either way, it's not good business and it's obviously shaking peoples faith in them.

I placed an order with Bitspend on March 14th, 2013 and the first half of my order arrived today! I am ecstatic about today's arrival because the earliest I was expecting my raspberry pi was the 20th!
I must commend Bitspend on their business ethic. After submitting the order via their site(would've linked, but they're down), I got a response email within ~10 minutes to confirm product and pricing. I sent the payment and got receipts no more than 5 minutes later. These guys are great and were there with an answer in minutes, every step of the way.
If you have doubts about buying online through a "third-party" purchaser, or just haven't had enough persuasion to get off the fence, I highly recommend you give it a shot with Bitspend. They will not disappoint.
IMHO, the more grass-roots companies we have supporting bitcoin, the better off we'll all be. Maybe this way we can all receive some real customer service and value.
Thanks again Bitspend!!

I was so close to depositing funds via Bitinstant today that I nearly threw a child like tantrum when I didn't. The thing that held me back was reading the warning at the bottom of the page stating that btc to email and cash deposits were being delayed til Monday, the 11th.
I'm sorry to hear you're stuck in limbo with no way of knowing what the outcome will be. I hope things work out satisfactorily for you. On the bright side, at least you know to stay away from them next time.

@_date: 2013-03-09 17:45:36
I agree. Again though, that's simply speculation. I personally haven't done enough research into the number of unfulfilled transactions Bitinstant has had recently, so my theory is only dust in the wind. However, if they have even a third of the bad transactions I would imagine they do, they're effectively ruining their name for a good long while.

It very well could have been, though Bitinstant claims the opposite. They posted on their blog on the 4th( stating they lost $12k+ in assets. I find it odd they haven't been in contact with you in some form to at least keep you updated on the situation.

By this logic, plus the info found [here]( in the past two days, Mt.Gx has made $243k +/- depending on exact fees users incurred($243k was figured with the assumption all fees were a steady 0.8%).

Check out the [Bitcoin wiki]( page on confirmations for your answer.
You are not silly for having faith in blockchain. There is nothing wrong with using it for storage, but you must always remember that you are leaving your coins stored on the internet. That means they are vulnerable. No matter how well something is protected, or encrypted, or hidden, there is a way to get to it. This is why I store my coins in a physical, digitally disconnected manner. Physically taking the slip of paper from my person is the only way someone could access my coins.
EDIT: There is no stupidity in ones lack of knowledge. If you are serious about bitcoin, read up on it. Imitate the actions of those that are successful. Most importantly, ask questions if you do not understand. As u/scientastics commented near the top of this thread: 


@_date: 2013-03-09 09:01:43
People! People! Get a hold of yourselves!! Don't you see this is marring the very core of what bitcoin is? Why are we condoning the involvement of centralized financial institutes, the very same institutes that profit from our oppression, in the most viable free market tool to date?
We are working towards an epiphany! Let us not fall back to the comforts of sweet nothings, whispered to us in the form of fine print. Bitcoin is not the prodigal son of the treacherous institutes it works to free us from. It is much more than that, but only if we stand by it.
Again, I ask you. Why are we condoning the joining of centralized systems we vie to break free from, in the greatest financial tool we so badly need?
Stay thy hand. Touch not thine plastic. For with thine faith btc shall prevail.

To be honest, the fluctuations I've seen over the past few nights of checking value have not shocked me like the drop I just saw. Maybe I just haven't been watching adamantly enough to have witnessed such a drop before, but that sheer cliff it hit(and quickly recovered from) put me on edge.
You speak the truth though. Long term puts the risk at a nominal level versus short term "OMG! I just lost X amount of dollars and... oh, okay. The price is going up again..."
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:00:37
Per the blockchain.info [wallet API page]( "To improve wallet performance addresses which have not been used recently should be moved to an archived state. They will still be held in the wallet but will no longer be included in the "list" or "list-transactions" calls."
What this tells me is that, if you are actively using an address, there is no need to archive it. If you are looking for secure storage of an undetermined time-frame, I would recommend using a paper wallet, but that's just what I'm comfortable with.
I would advise against using the paper wallet function found on blockchain.info simply for security purposes. I honestly don't know what would happen in the (unlikely) event your identifier and passphrase were compromised and your bitcoins were stolen. I would imagine the paper wallet you have locked away would be no good because in the eyes of the chain, you would be attempting to reclaim "spent" funds and, as we all know, a double spend is a big no no.
I personally use [bitaddress]( for my paper wallet needs. It is small enough to install/run from a USB(preferably on a cold computer, aka one that's never been connected to the internet) and I've never had an issue redeeming the private keys on blockchain. Yes, you will pay a miners fee whenever you deposit funds to a bitaddress generated wallet, but I personally chalk that up to my payment for security I can trust.
Hope this helps!
