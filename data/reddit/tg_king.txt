Bitcoin's fees don't exist just for fun. They are crucial for the security of the chain. They are expensive right now due to huge demand. Scalability is being worked on, but the bitcoin developers have chosen to not sacrifice security for the sake of quick and easy scalability. Hence all of the debates

She said someone on the news said that Bitcoin fell below 6k because governments won’t allow it and it’s too easy to hide money in it. Also that blockchain has value, but bitcoin doesn’t. 
She wouldn’t have told me about it unless she was concerned about my holdings.

How can you say that this crash was the scariest? Nothing happened in this time period that threatened the success of the network at all. It was only a drop in price caused by over exuberance and subsequent panic. 
There have been other drops in price that coincided with events that led educated people to believe that there was a decent chance Bitcoin would fail entirely. That was not the case this time.
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:50:51
Most of those 1500 coins have basically zero value and are not at all secure. None are as secure as bitcoin.
In a few years only coins with a clear use case will have any significant market cap. Bitcoin is almost guaranteed to be one of these coins. Sure people can choose to put their money in one of the others, but your original comment stated that anyone can make a coin that would contribute to the devaluation of bitcoin. This is just not true.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:54:16
Right... I edited that part out 
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:18:53
Anyone who says this is just exposing their ignorance... blockchain technology only functions when certain incentives are in place. If I make a coin right now that no one sees as valuable there is no chance that it will be decentralized or secure due to the fact that no one will be devoting resources to mine it. A coin like this does not dilute the value of bitcoin. That’s like saying Monopoly money dilutes the value of USD.
Bitcoin has been functioning in a secure and decentralized manner for 9 years. The insane amount of hash power behind it makes it impossible to attack. Its ability to fork is a feature to block efforts to hijack the coin. Those forks create a new chain. They are not bitcoin and they do not dilute the value of bitcoin due to the fact that they no longer enjoy the security and decentralization of the bitcoin blockchain.
This is the same reason it’s hilarious when people say that they’re not huge fans of bitcoin, but they’re really excited about blockchain technology.

BTC is absolutely more valuable than some coin that someone named after their favorite movie and that random coin does not decrease the scarcity of BTC directly or indirectly

People need to stop comparing beanie babies bitcoin... did anyone ever think beanie babies would make any sort of difference in the world? People only bought them because of their scarcity or because they just thought they were cute. Most of them weren’t even scarce at all. Horrible comparison

This is sort of how democracy works in that politicians want to get re-elected, so they have to listen to what the people want to a certain extent. This has flaws as well and I would argue that it is not nearly as elegant as what I'm talking about with bitcoin.
Most other governance systems put a lot of trust into a small group of people to do what is best for the people. Frequently this doesn't end well...

Whatever analogy you want to use I disagree at this point in time. People are going crazy over projects that are nowhere near proving themselves in actual application

That’s entirely irrelevant to the scarcity of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:18:56
Divisibility does not change the scarcity of bitcoin. If everyone in the world wanted 300,000 satoshis they still would have to buy them from someone. If we changed the btc denomination to satoshis today it would still be just as scarce.

So you don’t believe the most secure network the world has ever seen has any value? How about humanity’s first trustless currency with no central authority? I don’t need to convince you of anything. The value of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole will be proven over time and eventually people who shared sentiments such as your own will be laughed at just like the people who doubted the internet get laughed at today.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:50:24
Because they are a blank canvas for speculators to draw their own idea of what the future of each coin is going to be. Take Tron for an extreme example. It currently does literally nothing, but the creator tells everyone that once it does something it will be the new internet. Since it is so new and so far from completion there is nothing to prove that it won’t be the new internet, so people throw their money in and hope to get rich.
I am invested in alt coins as well, but I stay away from the brand new ones that are currently far away from reaching their intended function.

The math that mining computers do is basically just guessing a random number through brute computing strength. They are not solving difficult problems equivalent to finding cures for diseases.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:59:13
Blockchain does not work in a secure decentralized way without proper incentives in place. Bitcoin has achieved these incentives and they are not easily duplicated. People have to agree that the blockchain has value otherwise they would not waste the resources to process the transactions.
Blockchain without incentives can only work if it is centralized. We have had centralized ledgers for a very long time, so that would not be very exciting.

I wouldn't expect the price to go up much until the Chinese exchanges close. I think people are hoping for another dip and are holding off buying right now.
Then again I'm very new to this and the way people act is super unpredictable, so who knows haha.

A scissor would have intrinsic value due to its usefulness... Its ability to cut things is what gives it natural value which is why people are willing to trade money for it.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:56:40
It's hilarious how the same people who get pissed off when anyone calls BTC a scam will turn around and do the same to other blockchains that are trying to accomplish entirely different objectives. 
Some coins have proven to be scams, but the most reputable ones are legitimately trying to bring blockchain technology to the masses. I think we should all support that whether we're personally invested or not.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:42:12
Increasing the block size is a temporary fix that would just lead to bigger and bigger blocks which would eventually lead to sacrifices in security and decentralization. You are misinformed when it comes to lightning network, so I would recommend further research. Your points 5 and 6 honestly don’t make much sense.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:21:11
Bitcoin has way more hashing power than any altcoin based on it and it has 9 years worth of confirmed transactions, so it is indeed much more secure.
I’m not basing value on it being first. I’m basing value on it being the best option currently and the most likely to be adopted. There are many reasons to believe this, some of which are stated in my post.
Most alt coins are actually not as scarce as bitcoin. This is kind of aside from the point I was trying to make though. I didn’t really intend for this to be a bitcoin vs alt coins post.
As stated in the OP there are no other relevant blockchains solving scalability issues without sacrificing security and centralization. A lot of the most popular alt coins right now don’t even have a functioning mainnet, so I would be surprised if any of them solve blockchain’s scalability issues any time soon. I believe in ETH as well, but they are making some security sacrifices with POS

@_date: 2017-10-16 19:49:01
Ah man that's just not true. Things that naturally have value have intrinsic value. That would include food, materials, precious metals etc. BTC is only useful once there is a value assigned to it thus it does not have intrinsic value. This is not an argument against BTC as I mentioned in my first comment.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:46:47
Hmm I've gotta disagree with you there I think. Its encryption has given people the confidence to assign a high value to BTC, but that doesn't mean it has intrinsic value IMO. I'll definitely give that some more thought though.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:43:47
Luckily this guy has Chainlink in his portfolio which is a decentralized trust less oracle with the objective of bringing outside data onto the blockchain and then he has ARK to share that data between blockchains efficiently using smart bridges.... you guys need to stop blindly calling everything besides BTC a "shit coin" and wake up to the fact that blockchain is going to have massive implications everywhere, not just in currencies.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:33:33
We're probably going to have to agree to disagree otherwise we'll go in circles, but BTC's current usefulness is as a store of value. Those things give people confidence in assigning a value to it, but they don't give it natural usefulness.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:23:17
You might argue that, but you would be wrong
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:03:37
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:10:34
Does no one in this sub see any value to blockchain other than its use as a currency? ETH is not intended to be a store of value the way BTC is. It will be used as gas for decentralized applications. Its current price is speculative and will increase drastically once good Dapps actually start launching assuming it doesn't fall apart before then for whatever reason. BTC is great, but I don't get why you guys are so opposed to other use cases for blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:06:05
Totally! I'm sure the majority of people here are supportive in general. I've just seen enough people who clearly haven't done their research that I felt like this needed to be said.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:28:28
The work required to create a bitcoin today is much more taxing than the process of creating a US dollar. A bitcoin has no intrinsic value, but neither do any of the paper currencies and neither do the numbers in your bank account. By your measure bitcoin is less of a scam than any other currency you may use currently.
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:27:52
The only reason I own bitcoin is because I believe it will be useful in the future. I have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours reading/watching/listening about this space and I firmly believe that bitcoin, and probably a good amount of other cryptocurrencies, have a bright future. If Bitcoin is used by many people the price will go up due to the simple economics of supply and demand. There are many other people just like me.
People aren’t buying Bitcoin to change the world, they’re buying Bitcoin because there’s a decent chance that it will change the world. If Bitcoin has any amount of major adoption the price will soar. Guaranteed. For people like me the risk vs reward is worth it. 
Beanie Baby collectors who expected a return were simply hoping that one day their collection would be worth a lot of money despite the fact that there were tons of them being manufactured and they aren’t useful for anything. Most people bought them just because they liked them and enjoyed collecting them for fun. There is no comparison to be made here.

You yourself mining is not enough to make the network function, so you should probably be a little bit more grateful for the incentives that make bitcoin decentralized and secure
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:22:25
It is. What’s your point? It’s great that you mine out of charity, but most people do it for profit. Bitcoin would not be where it is right now were it not for mining profitability.
