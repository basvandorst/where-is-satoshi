Tell them to fuck the fuck off and don't worry about you

Contact them via email. I tried to shapeshift BTC to eth many times a day and about 90% of the time they said "the address expired that's why you didn't get the eth" which can't be the case because it was no way over 10 minutes... Not the point
Contact them via email with your tx id and explain the situation, you will get refunded. Specify a return address

Trezor is secure and user friendly as someone said already. If it breaks your bitcoins are still safe as long as you've written your seed down / backed it up somewhere. It's also safe from theft assuming they will my guess the custom pin you set. You can also "hide" wallets with multiple passwords 
I also have two.

I have a few questions / would like some advice. I own a Trezor but never got around to using it. Currently most of my coins are stored on a blockchain.info wallet. I'd like to also use a paper wallet, say 10 on my paper wallet and 5 on my Trezor. Would it be smart to keep them split up like that?
Also, with paper wallets. When I want to sweep my funds I must send ALL coins to a destination address? What are the scenarios that I would LOSE my coins using a paper wallet? Minus exposing my recovery phrase / losing it. Should I also make multiple paper wallets rather than send a full amount to one? (10 10 10 10 10 rather than 50 in 1)
Are there any other steps / recommendations than what's on bitcoinpaperwallet.com?
I feel like I should be holding the bulk of my coins in paper wallets, so what would be the most secure way to go about it?

Some people, myself included.. Don't wish to buy gift cards from a third party to use on Amazon. I would spend a lotttt of money on Amazon if they were to accept BTC/ltc just because they do.

This seems like it'd be a network / device based kind of error. I'd be weary of someone at your work maybe trying to gain access?
