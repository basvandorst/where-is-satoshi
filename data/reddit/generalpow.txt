my city just set up a bitcoin ATM, does anyone know of a tutorial on how to use one? I'll mostly be taking cash out but I'd like to know all there is to know about it, thanks

Wow, an editorial cartoon that's actually tolerable and insightful.

Simply how to use one would be appreciated but the logistics of how it works would be interesting to me as well.

Does anyone know how cashing out the bitcoins from a pre-existing wallet works with the ATM's?

I'm going to lobby the federal reserve/congress in relation to all the terrorists and criminals who launder using actual, physical fiat currency and see how effective that argument is

I agree but what do you expect? The media can be gutless vultures at times, I wish the best to your brother and thank him for the great service he's done to the world

Great info, thanks
 How about cashing out bitcoins though, how does that work?
