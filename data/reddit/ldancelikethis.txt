is the collection of problems that have been solved up to this point. Nano solves some of those problems but not the set that bitcoin does.

I don't know much, this are my probably wrong ideas. But first, I like Nano - just clearing that up.
Where it differs from BTC 
Costlier than lightning
Liquidity for now
Privacy - That's where btc better hurry up and Nano as well.

Some of these bot guys look at the market depth with a bit more 'depth' than you and I. They're calculating the curve, micro-bid/ask and buys in a myriad ways to try to outsmart the other botsys.
Just like some are hunting for your stop losses by purposely buy selling at market with big orders, some are hunting for other bots reactions by manipulating the depth walls.
As many say here, ignore the noise and don't give to the temptation of trying to outsmart them. The way to outsmart them is to zoom out and trade on the 4hr candle or larger time periods. Better yet, place your btc under your keys and move out of any place that allows shorting.

I told my son to buy some instead of Steam games and he laughed. I bought 5 for him to have some money when he (if ever) goes to college. He's now in highscool and still buys steam shit and doesn't care how much his 5 have lost in fake fiat money. The age gap goes both ways.

actually the halving will be too late. It is now that the pre-halving bull starts. Draw halving verticals on a long term btc and you'll see for yourself.
