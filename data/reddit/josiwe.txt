Hi, I'm trying to understand the graph.
Please correct my interpretation:
The candle in question represents one minute of trading around 7:30pm. The price opened around 681, closed around 683, and had a low of 633 caused by the exceptional trade.
When you say 3000 BTC into the order book, that means that roughly 3000 BTC in trades with downward price pressure should have executed before this particular trade was executed.
So there were a bunch of people who had put in orders to buy BTC at a higher price than 633 but somehow bitstamp executed this other trade or pair of trades for 12.37 BTC before them?
Wouldn't someone have to be selling that low in order for the trade to execute? Or is it a case that someone wanted to sell their 12.4 BTC fast and offered it cheap, and the trading engine found the lowest bid and matched it?
Sorry if these questions are too newbish, I'm trying to learn more about trading.

Very few people believe 100% without exception. They might believe 99%, but there's that 1% that recognizes nothing is certain except death, and it might be wise to hedge against the possibility that despite their beliefs they might be wrong. This is the same reason the crazy end-times people don't give away all their money and possessions every time some prophet claims the world will end on 5/15/15 because they found proof in the bible.

They don't generate the private key. You generate the private key in your browser. You then encrypt it and send them the encrypted information.
Think of it this way - your browser goes "Hmm, what's a really, really big random number? Ok, I have that number X. Now, I'll run all this javascript code locally to turn that totally random number into a keypair (Y,Z). Now I'll encrypt that keypair with the user's password: encrypt((Y,Z) + p = gobbledygook / cyphertext. Ok, now I'll send the cyphertext to Blockchain. Whenever the user wants, I can get the cyphertext from Blockchain, then locally decrypt it using the super secret p that Blockchain doesn't know but my user does - then I'll have the private key (Y,Z) again and I can do transactions."

Personally, I got burned because I thought understanding bitcoin was all the research I needed to do. I'm not a trader or investor, I just had a bunch of money that had been sitting in my checking account for years because I didn't trust the stock market. (First clue that I didn't understand investing/finance.) Anyway, I got interested in bitcoin, followed it, researched what it was and how it worked, security, etc. And then I worked myself up to buy in. Once I made the mental commitment to buy, I figured my risk was in my understanding of bitcoin, not my understanding of banking / exchanges / solvency. The only exchange I really knew about was Gox, because that was the site everyone referenced the price from. I had seen there were some issues with fiat withdrawals, but I figured I just want to buy some BTC and then sit on it so who cares? So I got verified, sent them my fiat, and a month later they halted btc withdrawals. I had been waiting for another price drop and my limit order bought in before I fully understood what was happening. Now it's basically all gone. 
It was a very expensive lesson, but I learned it. Need to research the actors as well as the investment. Also start small, put in 1% and gradually build up your holdings, don't send a huge lump sum to anyone. I'll be buying a small amount on a reputable exchange and immediately moving my coins to my paper wallet over the coming months because I still believe in bitcoin and I won't repeat my mistakes with gox.
It's hard reading all the comments about how I'm an idiot and I got what I deserved, but hey, it's the internet, it's full of assholes. Besides, I still have my job and emergency funds, a family who loves me, and hopefully many years to earn more money. Some people have lost their homes or committed suicide. Being angry or depressed about it is just a waste of time. I do hope Karpeles either makes me whole or goes to jail, but there's not much I can do about it so I'll just wait and see what happens.
tl;dr: first time investor believed in bitcoin, didn't understand enough about investing to even know the right questions to ask about where to do business. picked the oldest biggest exchange thinking it was safe.

Is it possible Bitstamp bought the BTC itself and then turned around and sold it on their own exchange? They have all the orders, so they can see arbitrage opportunities like this and interrupt the order queue to snap up cheap coins. Although it wouldn't make much sense to display it on the chart if they were doing this.

Actually I'm having trouble understanding quite a bit about the system.
WP says a wallet contains lots of keypairs. So I make the public key from one keypair into a bitcoin address (vague on what this means/is) and then lots of people 'send' coins to that address.
I think this means that they announce a transaction into the network, assigning coins to my public address and signing the change in ownership with their private key. So now the coins consider themselves to belong to my address.
So, 10 years later, I finally use my private key to transfer all my coins in one fell swoop to some bank or exchange. Why do I even need a wallet? Don't I just need a keypair?

Is this like the usb security devices they sell for online games? So I'd need my password and the physical usb to decrypt? But then I'm stuck with the same problem - what do I do if the usb stick dies?
Seems from reading that my best bet is to solidly encrypt a wallet and then just store it online - presumably if I encrypt it correctly and keep the password to myself I could post the encrypted file on facebook and nobody would have the time or resources to crack it and steal my bitcoins.

This seems pretty resistant to decay so long as you use good quality acid free paper and stick it in an airtight container. It does seem like a pretty big hassle though.

As I said in my original post, this is speculation, not investment. I appreciate the risk. Thanks for the warning, though.

This is essentially the macro version of the bitbills mentioned elsewhere, correct?

Yes, I did read up on those. Seems like the redemption process is kind of a bitch, but I guess I could always just sell the physical bills for cash. Certainly sticking them in a deposit box would be secure. I think the largest denomination they make is 20btc though, so I'd need a stack of cards to get up in the hundreds.
