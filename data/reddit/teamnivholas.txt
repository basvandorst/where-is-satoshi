I picked up some ETH at ~$88 and felt pretty good about it. But who is this person? And can some dissect their tweet a little better for me?/:

That our economy could go north or deeply south depending on how many bridges this idiot in office burns to the ground and how well he devalues the hell out of our dollar.
I know very few Americans that think this country is going to be an amazing place to be living in the next 3-5 years. What a coincidence... I read everywhere the next 3-5 years is the next realistic HUGE jump in innovation, regulation and implementation of blockchain in our world.
That’s not to say we won’t see a random bull market for this years end, perhaps next years beginning. But great things do take time. After a few years in the space it’s obvious we’re only truly gaining traction now from the big players that have no choice but to embrace blockchain..

I agree! This market is STILL (IMO) in it’s infancy and the money starting to enter now isn’t some insider trading money or “bulltrap” money. This has to be institutional/semi-new-to-crypto buyers and bots playing the “holy shit, this stuff really is undervalued” move. I could be horribly wrong. I won’t be mad if I am...(accumulation!!!!!!)
Btw I only commented on your comment because HAPPY CAKE DAY!
Hope your birthday next year is accompanied by some impressive gains!

How much would that pull ETH, LTC AND/OR XRP to? 
I understand binance US is opening in a ~few weeks. Perhaps that could be a good start for the bullrun to the level you’re claiming..?

125k BTC.... then $50k BTC... small error there in your key..

The rainforest has needed all of us for a long time. But percent being burnt is down 15% from “normal” amount of fires.
The rainforest “epidemic” has been going on for quite some time. Although, it’s made a decent distraction for many people this year. Who knows why..?

Before I even checked the comments I saw the word “bitcoin” pop up on the right towards the end.
Then noticed many people don’t lie you wasting their time with your post. If this is indeed in San Jose this is awesome.
Everyone taking note; please share the random finds like these. That “billboard” screen that is obviously set for some sort of advertising just randomly playing a loop of futuristic art that just so happens to say bitcoin at the end is truly awesome. Someone engineered this loop to say that. May be a graphic designer trying to be more public about his adoption views. Possibilities are ultimately endless without knowing who or what company paid to have that loop playin the airport... BUT imo, this is good(:

Or what most criminals do... DO IT ANYWAYS!
I’d take either/both options haha

I’m extremely new to the crypto space but why wouldn’t the person that wants to invest that much just set buy order for slightly lower than market cost and wait for dips to eat his order limit... of course with this much fiat; over many exchanges with multiple order would this be advantageous?
Just a thought! Keep the talk going(:

If we hold our own assets; we’re the criminal.
But the banks can hold it all, loan it all, or just ask for more.
With the promise of plan Z to be bailed out if they do it wrong(: WOW!
