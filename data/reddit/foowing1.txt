I recently just bought Bitcoin and have used it several times now to buy things.  
First thing I bought with Bitcoin was a new Drip feed system.  
The second thing I bought was some domain names.  
And the last thing I bought was my shopping from Tesco after I got myself the Coinbase Visa Card.  
Now I am free to spend my bitcoin any where they accept Visa.

Bitcoin, or new digital crypto currency is a new currency. One which is not controlled by banks or governments. It's value is transparent and is not manipulated by inflation and deflation. When you buy bitcoin you are simply saving your money as a digital currency which only you can touch. No one can take it away from you like what the banks and governments can do.  
You can use bitcoin to pay for anything you need with a Bitcoin Visa card.  
It allow you to take full control over your own finances and prevents middle men from taking a cut of your money while you are saving it.  
Bitcoin is a true value of the money you own compared to the rest of the world. And you can use it anywhere in the world without needing to convert it and pay more middle men.

My thought is that you should always create a repayment plan when borrowing any money. And stick too it!
Then any spare cash you can invest.  
And if you want to buy something instead of borrowing use your investment money.
Pay off your debts first. That way no one is milking you for interest on your debt. No point investing if your profit is going to pay for interest on debts and you never pay off your debts.
