I guess you don't know how to read.
He never said anything bad about bitcoin, it's the people in bitcoin that make bitcoin so foul. Kind of like how you were so quick to throw shit at him, actually no, perfect example of the disgusting nature of bitcoiners.

Yeh, the only thing I ever sold on ebay was an ARdrone. I sold it for 200+15 shipping, they took fees from the 200, then took fees from the shipping. Somehow they thought it was ok to charge me $25 in fees. After that I was like F*** this s***!
No idea how all those ebayers stay afloat.

If you wonder why it takes so long to load and reload the page of some exchanges. I think you just understood why.
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:02:11
I've done that, but it's like: add card to paypal as long as the card wasn't bought with paypal, paypal to virworx, buy lindens with paypal, convert lindens to bitcoins; with fees every step of the way.

only way to really do this is to build a modified bitcoin core and tell everyone to start using it instead, as there is literally no way you are going to get the mining pools to change anything unless you put a huge strain on them.
The bad thing about this? They will figure out a way of getting past not being able to use the network to relay TX.

The word terrorist is in the realm of the purely psychological, it just means "someone who induces fear into a population." 
You don't actually have to do much other than make viable threats to be an actual terrorist.

Neckbeards are traditionally basement dwellers, existing primarily underground where they spend most of their free time when not working their part-time pizza job. They have poor eyesight thus a common unkept appearance, and usually stink of fast-food and many weeks unwashed grease caked on their skin.
If you happen upon a neckbeard in the wild, it is best to ignore or avoid them. Or, be prepared to pedantically argue over the most unimportant details of the most unimportant topic you could have ever fathom existed. A neckbeard will always refer to wikipedia, and demand sources of any claims no matter how obvious the subject may seem. Example: gravity, without a wikipedia link to an article about gravity, a classic neckbeard will assume a contrary position and work toward falsifying your claim on the basis you did not provide previous evidence that gravity in fact even existed. A neckbeard will also identify and argue over the validity of your concerns.
A neckbeard will never answer a question outright, because then he would have been useful.
Their have also been confirmations of females being neckbeards, they traditionally inhabit S&amp;M forums and chat rooms, commonly write tabboo erotic stories about furries, and are never less than 250 lbs overweight. -yes they do have facial hair, although patchy.
P.S. I hid an error in this message, a neckbeard will have found instantly.
P.S.S. the origin is Richard Stallman.

I think you have what we call a "fundamental misunderstanding of bitcoin".
If I break into your house, install a keylogger on everything you own, wait a couple weeks and then break in while you sleep and take everything you own.
When you wake up I'm pretty sure you'd understand the physicality.

All US prepaid debit cards like the Vanilla Visa since 2013, cannot be processed outside USA. (Thanks terrorgov) Therefore you must find someone who sells, that uses a processor inside USA, which AFAIK we don't have.

some people spend a lot of time going after these assholes, but we can't actually do anything about them unless we go black, and in that case if you go black why not scam instead? It gets hard AF keeping up with all the shit they pull. this special fucker owes me 13BTC.
Ya know the fucked up thing about it. the way this whole community is setup, it makes it super hard to warn people about these scammers. The promoters bring in fresh meat every single day, just ripe for the picking. It's set up in a way that makes it increasingly easier for them to pull their scams too, because they do indeed target the new people who don't know how devious they are yet.
I too wish I could bring myself to con people, i could make metric ton of coin. I fucking love the heist film genre. It just makes me feel bad thinking about taking people's money that way tho. I mean on a poker table, everything on it is mine, because that's the game, and everyone knows it. But, knowingly tricking regular people out of their money with confidence games is so fucking low brow and scummy.

Both of my parents growing up in different parts of the planet were subject to US military chemical weapons testing during their youth. Both have debilitating illnesses linked to these chemical weapons testing. I myself am also mentally affected.
If the fact I know I'll never be a productive member of society has anything to say about it, then I don't know what terrorism is.

I'm kind of surprised you spelled that correctly.
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:14:49
they didn't thank you, did they...
Why is it none of these scammers ever say thank you.
I mean geez, common courtesy goes a long way. I know if I just stole a bunch of money from someone knowing I can't get in trouble for it. I'd at least tell them thanks. But I guess that's why think bitcoiners like the scumbag that started this branch needs to be shoved in a gas chamber.
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:07:19
this would only work if the US government actually counted your votes. It's very naive to believe they do. they only count what you are registered as. This is how bush vs gore happened, paid people went through phone books registering everyone republican. some of them got caught afterwards.

Serious? they finally have a US processor now? Do you know this first hand or did someone tell you this? I spent like 3 months waiting on them to get one, until I finally gave up in april and haven't returned since.
