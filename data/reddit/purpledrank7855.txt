Looks like a good time to snatch up some delicious BTC.

When wider adoption starts, but for now my life still requires SOME fiat. Landlord don't fuck with Bitcoin.

Play the looooong game. Just don't panic and seek if it goes to 3k

What's a good way to learn about basic TA? I'm shit at day analysis. There are a million YouTube videos about it but how to know who's a kook and who's legit?

What alts are you liking for 2020? I was lucky enough to get into VET and KMD a few months ago from a tip a friend gave. 
Here's hoping altseason is back on the horizon.

That's true it depends on how fast it pumps. When we see those big time runs it always pulls back like 20/30%. I've done well playing with a small percentage of my BTC and when these happen, to try and I prove my position.

Not possible to do both? I mean if you're not hoping to make yourself comfortable with the freedom it doesn't make sense.

Pretty sure that's exactly what I said. "Just don't panic and sell at 3k."

Sure I keep 80% in BTC, but the right investment in an alt has the potential to make serious profit. The last bull run ltc changed my life when it went from 50$ to 330$ almost overnight.

What exchanges/platforms offer call options?
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:15:32
Well done sir.
@_date: 2019-08-24 19:37:13
I'd love to have one myself

Yeah it's bullshit they keep money in "unsettled funds" so they can make money on your float.
@_date: 2019-10-01 04:08:13
I sold a grand in stocks when BTC dropped to 7.8k. It still is sitting in unsettled funds and BTC is poppin again.

I decided to do this. I have steady income and no attachments. each month I stack more Satoshi, and I put my savings I'm BTC, because the banks charge me to hold my own fiat. 
I've been broke before, and if it happens again there are always jobs you can grind that money back. 
I believe that this is the best price you will ever get BTC at again, so I'd prefer it went south and I lost it all, then I missed the boat.

In a few years it will be this way for auto/real estate leases.

Can I get on this text list?
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:57:54
It's the airport. There's about 4000 wierdos all over the place. What's one more dude on his phone. Catching a lot of heat from this post damn.
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:49:38
You get it, my dude. Enjoy the BAT.

There's also a visual of IOT connections and they have recent chains attached.
@_date: 2019-09-07 06:28:34
At least someone made the connection.
