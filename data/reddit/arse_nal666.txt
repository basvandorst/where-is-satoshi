You need to make a last minute, absolute emergency purchase, would you rather:
* have the card go through normally but incur on a fee if the money isn't put back before midnight
* have the card rejected

What in THE FUCK is going on?  who's buying so much?? Like.. I like it, my btc is worth a lot now.. but it's like fake.. I feel like I'm being lead on, this is unsustainable, this is unnatural.. it's bound to fail.. ugh.. who the fuck keeps buying so much and driving the price up?? should I even buy more before it reaches goddamn 25k, or wait for a dip?? god this is a bizarre, confusing ass time...

not everyone bought at $900 a year ago, a lot of unfortunate folk bought at 20k

The growth is fake and unnatural, and i'm not selling shit, I'm holding for the long-run, I'm just worried about the current destabilization of bitcoin by outside powerful forces, idiot.

"Dad, remember a year ago when you said I wouldnt be able to afford a watch? Well I worked my ass off for months, invested all my minimum wage onto it and spent it all on a... watch"

It'll go up beyond 11k eventually.. might take a week or two or a month but it definitely will at some point

2018: remember when the internet wasn't censored and you could actually access any website?

Once you invest in something, you'll defend it like it's your wife.. it's like those poor mofos who were saying BitPetite was coming back and they were just rebuilding their site after that shit closed.

I have a pc with an i7 and one 1070, how much could I mine with nicehash? Are we talking pennies or actual money?

Why would it suddenly go down 5k when it hasn't gone done more than 1k at a time and always recovered for like a whole year? the curve is a steady upward trend when you look at it from the yearly view, these little dips don't mean anything in the long-run.. I doubt it will EVER go back to 5k..

Freaking download a wallet and install it on your PC, takes two minutes tops.. Exodus is a good one.

Honestly I was waiting to get paid on the 1st to buy some and now the shit went up to like almost 6500, at the same time, the little bit I had is growing which is cool. I seriously envy those who've been holding a decent amount for a while, it must feel so fucking good.
