You have a lot of interesting things to say.
It's a good thing I only cash out fiat for my burger and beer (after 10% tax here in Bulgaria) and the rest is Bitcoin only which is hedged on futures exchange offshore; i.e. I never go to fiat to protect my stash from price fall. Oh, and no wealth tax here either. Capitalism is pretty sweet!
It's also a good thing I'm not stuck in the US or some other western (read: communist/socialist) hellhole; are you even "allowed" (lol!) to go short using margin in the US now? What about on futures? I prefer futures anyway. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:05:14
This looks bad. We better get the govt in on this shit so they can start printing more Bitcoin in order to "stimulate" the economy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:32:01
I wish them good luck with that -- and I hope they have enough money (from taxes?) to fund this work.

Govt "regulation" is pretty sweet, huh? This is why everyone trades on unregulated (read: legit) exchanges these days.

No, a 4yo child would rant for hours about things they know nothing about; just like you. I've blocked you. Ciao.

This relates to a different set of laws, dipshit.

No, I usually block people then get back to what I should be doing.

Capitalism will win. You have no idea what you're doing and dealing with. I'm so glad Satoshi designed Bitcoin the way he did.

This is already the case with 1mb blocks too, but for different reasons than bandwidth.

Good. This is *exactly* what Bitcoin was created to deal with. Wikileaks won big time on this
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:24:37
It is extremely important to learn about plausible deniability in this context. Everyone *must* have:
* *Several* password protected wallets in various forms
* A phone that you have already "lost" or can easily "lose". In some cases (and in some countries) in order to "prove" that you've lost your phone you must show that you've told the police that your phone was stolen.
  &lt;-- encryption is almost worthless without this!

Encryption, "privacy" and so on is worthless without this.

No it won't. Why? Because you said so yourself; it is *necessary* production.

@_date: 2018-11-14 18:31:10
Well, yeah, then nothing matters anyway and there is nothing to discuss really.
The point here is that in other cases where they'd actually need to come up with *some* sort of "reasonable" reason to destroy you -- Bitcoin (with some care) is able to protect one here. Or you might end up dead anyway, but it won't be because of Bitcoin -- which says something about Bitcoin.

The Electrum website is using TLS (HTTPS).

It didn't last and it wouldn't have lasted even if the cards today where still called "GPU". You don't get it; it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:03:17
Nice. Perhaps now we can create and/or actually start using a decentralized solution. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 09:56:18
Mmmh, bulk GPUs are *not* a decentralized thing. Only a few people can buy in bulk.
You people don't get it; it's about resources (money) and willingness to take risk no matter what.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:28:53


You people are completely clueless; I'm sure you think you're super smart though.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:11:03


You could run a I2P node too? It's a great and important project and more interesting in some ways than Tor: 
..you could also setup joinmarket ("yield generator"; this I would only do via Tor) in order to ensure that Bitcoin stays fungible and good money -- though this might be a better idea once joinmarket has segwit support.
Idle CPU and bandwidth can be used for many good things. I would not use a laptop for folding and similar though; it will die for sure.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:49:49
Yes, can tell you no real Satoshi would ever be into or spend time studying theology. WTF?
@_date: 2017-07-08 15:29:17


Bitcoins supply is controlled in that it is predictable. No one wants the "basic economics" shit you speak of; it is a lie. Who has been "educating" you? What are you even doing here?
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:59:24


Yes, but the same cannot be done with Bitcoin because it is so much easier to withdraw (real) Bitcoin compared to withdrawing physical gold or silver.
This basically means that the exchanges must remain solvent (i.e. hold real Bitcoin) or they face losing customer trust very, very quickly.
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:40:45
I think this woman has lost her mind. The way she drones on and on about the same shit every time she speaks (even here) is not helping. She's had several small strokes already (live on TV) few months ago....   sheesh.

This does not change my point. Everyone thought they where "informed" and "educated" based on these results. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 16:30:15
1 million per day will be spent on bulks of GPUs then. It makes no difference.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:18:04


He addresses this point and dilemma of course – but I'm guessing you didn't catch that and still call yourself "educated".


This is horseshit. You're insane. I'm glad we (I) have Bitcoin; exactly because of people like you.
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:47:11


It's almost as if switching to a decentralized currency that everyone can verify would be simpler and make sense.

This "education" b.s. is rather old.
Sugar was thought to be healthy compared to fat based on research during the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. Turns out all these "educated" people where wrong; sugar is terrible, terrible stuff based on more recent research and some pretty clear evidence (empirical).
Intellectuals have caused some of the biggest disasters in human history:

Good luck. I'm not doing that (2014-2015 was enough) and have been covering my ass with a short and partially in fiat on spot. This can go to 1850, 1800 or 1300(!) now and I won't care.

Something must be motivating you in order to want this. I think you know that the fed is making everyone, including you, poorer – while they enrich themselves and their immediate "friends".
