It's really sad to me to think about what Roger Ver is doing. From what I can tell, he was just a regular guy who struck gold big time on Bitcoin. He made millions and millions of dollars and he's set for life and then some. Cool! Now he wants more money? For what, to hoard it away so no one else can have it? 
It seems almost everyone who manages to get rich just wants more and more, having no problem with becoming parasitic to the well-being of the human race. It's really depressing if this is just human nature.
Roger, don't be a shitter, dude. Bitcoin made you more money than you could have imagined, and now you're attacking it just to get more money that you can't possibly need.

My coworkers are also starting to talk about Bitcoin. They had a big discussion of it yesterday. An older lady said stuff like "I don't know, it doesn't seem solid enough for me to make an actual investment. Could be a bubble, it's not even real etc." And people fired back with how USD is no better due to the federal reserve being able to create new dollars etc. They even said they think cash will be obsolete soon. I was the only hodler there but I didn't even have to say anything.

Newbie questions:
1. Why is the BTC price so high there right now?
2. Why are people willingly buying at that price?
3. It looks like the tokens (USDET?) were created to partially reimburse previous users of BTC-E who had money/coins on this exchange before it was shut down. And these tokens have their own market now. But why would people want to buy more of these tokens? Is there any reason their value would ever increase?

Interesting! Looks like it took Bitfinex 8 months to recover all that and reimburse the tokens. So we should probably expect a similar time frame for this, eh?
