Yep, I just bought $800 worth a few hours ago.

Exactly. I just converted some BTC to XMR and I had no experience with it. I did a test of around $20 and made sure it all worked out before I did the rest of around $500. Always best to be safe if unsure.

Tbh, I'm just betting that it will be a big darknet currency. It's all about privacy of transactions.

It was either a really smart or dumb move. I also transferred around $500 worth to Monero coins just before the crash a few days ago as I wanted to buy some and my current marked didn't support buying them directly. Now i just replaced the bitcoins I converted and bought a few more at a way lower price. See how it goes I guess.

My verification was done at mtgox in November 2013 and it only took a week or so. Today I just transferred all of my bitcoins to coinjar.io as they are easier to withdraw from to Australian bank accounts. Had no issues at all and the transfer was near instant. I expected there to be a wait from mtgox for verification (Who wouldn't after all the threads about them) so I did it months before I wanted to move the bitcoins so it would be a smooth process.

I disagree, if your bank/credit union is stopping you spending your own money then that is an issue!
@_date: 2014-08-07 03:51:28
+1 for coinjar if you are Australian.
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:42:48
Yeah, I was hoping for an easier method I could just use online. I already use coinjar.io with bank deposits but I kind of just wanted an easier way than going to the ATM, withdrawing cash, depositing in the bank just so I can purchase bitcoins.

How is this any different to coinjar.io which is an Australian based bitcoin wallet/trading site? Just wondering if I am missing something?

A quick google search brought up this which might help:

Cheers! I appreciate it :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 01:09:51
Thanks for the update even though it didn't go exactly as you had planned. You still have the bitcoins so that's the important part!

Of course SV has more startups (A lot of startups are now actually in San Francisco rather than SV). What i'm saying is that the startup scene is not dead here and there are lots of successful startups currently in Australia. Sure, if you want a huge amount of venture capital it will come from the US but there are still investors in AU for smaller amounts. It could be a hell of a lot better but it's hardly dead.

Yes Please!

I only have 3 BTC and I pulled them out Early Jan 14 as it was obvious that something would happen with mtgox. I honestly don't understand how anyone in their right mind with a significant amount of BTC would still have them in there.
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:21:46
I disagree on Australia having a dead startup culture. It's not ideal but it's hardly dead.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:04:28
Wow! I'm going to find somewhere else to sell and cash out when I need to as 4 months is insane!
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:27:03
I'm also interested in this. Everyone keeps saying this but I don't see anything on their site about not doing wire transfers?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:33:22
I was under the impression that a Japanese bank also does the international wire transfers. I'm in Australia so it would be good to know if anyone has experience with this?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:29:36
They would have the money but of course a lot of it would be invested etc... and not all in the same back account. Moving it around could take a few days for it to be available.
