It's all the robots you hear of, but you never hear how they work. I strongly believe this is how they work. Lets take GDAX for example, you have everything linked to USD and BTC. Let's say someone buys enough BTC for USD on the market to move the price up slightly, and let's freeze time at that split second. In our frozen time, the price of LTC/BTC, LTC/USD, ETH/BTC, and ETH/USD have not changed. So here come the computers, they have an algorithm to calculate whether or not they can make a bunch of simultaneous transactions on GDAX, for an overall net gain. For example, if they can spend $1,000 USD for X BTC, sell X BTC for Z LTC, sell Z LTC for more than $1,000 USD they execute the 3 trades simultaneously. 
I just took a snapshot of GDAX  at 9:31am EST for a more real example. BTC/USD = $10,800, BTC/LTC = 0.01665, and LTC/USD = $180.50. So to calculate it out, $1,000 USD could buy 0.09259259 BTC, which could buy 5.56111667 LTC, which can be sold for $1,003.78. Overall a net gain. As the market moves faster, higher percentages of money can be made. 
So this is why I believe they all follow each other. People are printing money risk free to even them out.

this is an extremely bad idea. You should all make 3 separate accounts.

To everyone saying buy with GDAX, you have to wait a week to transfer FIAT to coinbase to GDAX. Could end up spending more than the fees if the prices goes up in that week once the FIAT is available on GDAX

If you want more action, try trading alts. It's a traders paradise. Just don't use the margin for that
