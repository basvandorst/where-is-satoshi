So in what situation would Bitcoin be able to upgrade through a hard fork?
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:41:06
When do the fee costs end? After the first 20$ tx? Or after a hundred 20$ tx?
If you do 1 BTC tx a day, that would cost you 30x20=600$/month.
What kind of node are you running that costs you more than 600$/month?
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:32:57
So what percentage of the community has to agree before you would do a hard fork? And how do you measure that percentage of agreement?
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:50:25
Monero hard-forks every 6 months and they never had any problem

Wait, so are we allowed to talk about Bitcoin Cash or not?
@_date: 2017-02-03 07:25:46
Thanks, that makes sense. Although I'm still not comfortable with companies funding these developers. These companies are likely to have an agenda which requires bitcoin to function in a certain way. I would rather just have volunteers working on bitcoin and doing what they think is best for the system as a whole.

Thanks, so why are the Winklevoss twins having such a hard time making this happen?
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:10:05
But these were hundreds of guys, and anyone could join. Seemed to work out just fine to me for the first 7 years. Anyways I guess this is as close as people can get to "owning" bitcoin. Start a company, get tons of investment and manipulate the development.
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:18:24
I agree. An attempt at a hard fork is something that everybody should be free to do whenever they please. We should always try to avoid bugs though.
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:25:51
I'm wondering how this is possible. Are new businesses accepting bitcoin supposed to run a full node or can they just as well use an SPV client?
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:39:30
Thanks, that was very informative. You definitely make a good point about how everybody should be allowed to hire developers as they please, and the Peter Todd example is a good one. I just think we have to keep a close eye on how far these companies push their agendas on bitcoins future.
@_date: 2017-02-16 03:19:15
I agree. Just because a node can be shut down first of all doesn't mean that it's likely to shut down, and secondly doesn't mean that it disappears after being shut down. Nodes are not simply connections. It's people with certain believes and incentives that are running these connections and these believes and incentives should be regarded as water flowing downstream: you can build a dam in the middle of a stream but the water is just gonna flow around it.
It's pretty much the same with regards to miner centralisation in my opinion: Sure a big mining pool can be shut down, or implement certain policies on bitcoin. But the mining pools simply function as a proxy to the miners. Miners have certain believes and incentives of their own (profit probably being one of their key incentives) and can easily switch to a pool operator that better recognises the importance of decentralisation or censorship resistant transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-10 07:12:24
I think he is referring to some prominent Core developers working for blockstream, a company that will benefit from off-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:18:14
Would you mind elaborating as to which part of my statement you disagree with? 
More TX throughput causing more people to adopt bitcoin as a currency
More people adopting bitcoin as a currency will increase bitcoin's value?
Also, just calling somebody's views simplistic and naive without any arguments and then trying to generalise these traits to "big blockers" is not really helping the debate.
@_date: 2017-02-10 08:31:59
You are simply assuming I did not factor in these effects, but actually I did consider them.


I think you forgot to "factor in" the fact that with today's hardware and internet costs, a doubling of the blocksize would not cause any trouble in the average first world country's home PC. The "nodes-running-from-datacenters" argument would only apply to much much bigger blocks and somewhere in the future we should definitely take in to consideration that this causes centralisation. Right now however, raising the blocksize would attract much more usage and that would have a positive impact on the amount of nodes. That positive impact greatly outcompetes the amount of nodes that would fall of the network because they can't handle for example 2MB blocks.


This is a tough estimate to make. The amount of panic that a hard fork would cause in the price probably depends on the amount of consensus there is at the amount of forking. But to say that this panic-drop will always have a far more negative outcome than the throughput bonus (long-term) is a bit of a bold statement in my opinion.


Segwit has some cool features which I totally agree with should be implemented. However, implementing it through a softfork is a bit of a sneaky and dangerous idea and it also causes a great amount of technical debt:


Please provide some evidence to this claim. If you are talking about Lightning Network I would agree that this is an interesting piece of technology. Although we have yet to find out weather this could actually properly scale to the equivalent of worldwide trustless digital cash. And even if it could, bitcoins TX throughput right now (even with Segwit activated) would not be sufficient as a settlement layer once LN is widely adopted.


Please understand that the other side of this discussion feels exactly the same way, using words like that is only going to stall the debate and make you sound childish.

Bitcoin.com's mining pool software had a bug that caused it to mine a block &gt;1MB. They fixed the bug asap and lost the blockreward. It was in no way an attempt to fork the network to BU.
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:57:42
How does Segwit improve TX throughput 4x? I thought the latest estimates where a maximum of 2.3x and that was only if every node/wallet upgraded to the Soft Fork. 
Also, what do you think is Bitcoins bottleneck?

Obviously I don't get it, but: what's the difference between buying bitcoin as ETF as compared to just buying it on Poloniex for example? I don't see why this would be a big deal.
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:15:56


I disagree. Both parties would benefit the most (by a increase of the BTC price) if the TX throughput would allow more people to adopt bitcoin as a currency. The quickest way to obtain this is by raising the trivially set blocksize limit of 1MB. 
You are implying that the so called "Big Blockers" are mainly miners that are after peoples TX fees. First of all, these transaction fees currently only make up a small part of the current block reward, insignificant if you take bitcoins volatility in consideration. Secondly, an increase in blocksize does not mean a higher block reward. Yes the amount of TX will increase per block, but at the same time that means fee pressure will shrink and it's hard to predict what this will do to the block reward. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 02:52:18
These data are worth their bytes in satoshis
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:56:42
I can not comprehend this BIP. Sure, we have to make trade-offs between decentralisation and scalability but I don't see how that brings you at a 0.3M blocksize.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:31:12
Actually, both are true: price influences hashrate, and hashrate influences price. 
Also, both hashrate and price will follow utility. If BU forks at 75% it will take the Core chain 2 weeks to readjust their mining difficulty level which raises their block time to 40 minutes. That could cause more people to go to join the longest chain.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:00:30
I think you got that wrong. If you're lying you're always wrong, when you're wrong you're not necessarily lying. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 02:43:18
It's nice to see somebody consider the fact that Bitcoin can suffer from competition. Even if today's fees are not pushing people out to altcoins (which they are), in the future the trade off for fees/security will only become worse.
@_date: 2017-02-10 07:00:53
Please don't use "Segwit's TX throughput increase" and "Larger Blocksize" as synonyms. Understanding Segwit and the blocksize debate is hard enough as it is. If you start throwing these semantics around newcomers will think Segwit actually raised the 1MB cap.
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:58:43

No it did not react to market demands. But if we could make chemical compositions to our likings then gold better start reacting to market demands, if you catch my drift.
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:18:10
But if we keep the 1MB blocksize under the assumption that it's enough because of LN, then if LN turns out to become very centralised in practice, wouldn't that harm Bitcoin's decentralised nature?
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:00:06
Soft-forks are only significantly safer if the hard-fork is controversial. 
Also you seem to be worried about technical debt. Would a Segwit hard-fork not cause minimum amounts of technical debt compared to its soft-fork implementation?
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:07:17
On your second point:


E.g. Segwit requires more trust in miners.
@_date: 2017-02-04 12:39:16

@_date: 2017-02-14 16:04:17
The point I think he is trying to make is that fee prices will never go that high because everybody will have left bitcoin by that time.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:33:31
No it didn't, that's why he says the attack seems to have failed. The nodes just crashed, they restarted them and mined more blocks. Why would anyone be signalling BU if they don't believe it's a working client?
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:06:04
Do you think the decisions of what chain the miner's decide to mine on has any influence on where the hodlers will hodl?
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:07:45
The fees only make up like 20% of the block-reward. I think miners are much more worried the price of a bitcoin (affecting the other 80% of their blockrewards). 
Besides, every time their mining rewards go up Bitcoin is showing it's lack of utility as a currency which would risk their business model. 
I don't know why they are not accepting Segwit but I don't it's because of Lightning doing away with their fees.
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:55:50
Oh right, thanks for pointing that out
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:15:27
I'm not sure what a lapel is but you're comment doesn't seem very helpful either way. 
I'm genuinely concerned about some parts of the LN, if that makes you think I'm biased then I think you just don't like skepticism.
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:26:15


You're missing the point. He is trying to explain that 4mb blocks are a waste if you can only use 40% of them for actual transaction throughput whilst having to prepare for 4MB blocks in the case of an attack (i.e. on-chain scaling would be crippled)


Could you explain a little more about these or link me to some text?


But it still needs to be validated. If the validation of these "attack-blocks" takes too long it could become a threat to the network.


Thanks. I'm doing that as we speak actually.

@_date: 2017-03-29 04:39:49


Thanks for replying I guess, nice contradiction there.
Anyways, repeating your statement does not change the fact that hashrate is a more objective tool of measurement. You could argue that miners have different incentives but I'm not buying in to that. They want to make money and the best way to do that is by making bitcoins worth more. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 07:39:19
There are no duties in Bitcoin, only incentives. If miners don't think running a certain piece of software is going to make them more money the will refuse to run it. 
If you as a user think that the software should be run anyway you can try to fire the miners. The thing is however that users are dependent on miners just as miners are dependent on users. UASF is kind of like hard-forking off a big part of the miners, whereas BU activation with only miner support would hard-fork of a lot of the users. Both seem like terrible ideas to me.
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:35:09
I think the Core supporters are giving BU no choice. They either delay the public merging or they risk getting their bugs exploited.
This subreddit has upvoted BU's prior bug while censoring the fix. You really think it's fair to yell at them for delaying the public version of their next fix? It's one thing to disagree with opposing views and debate to the best of your abilities. It's another thing to promote the exploit of a bug, censor the hot-fix and then call them out as a closed source project for defending themselves.
For the love of Satoshi, let's keep this debate civil, even if we suspect the other side to be breaking that rule.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:52:51
By that logic shouldn't we also ban discussion about UASF? That seems to be deployed without consensus from the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-31 03:07:02
Thanks for all this helpful info, really nice to see such an honest and open conversation amidst all the hatred.

Unless we stop spreading so much FUD about hard-forks and just evolve like a decent coin.
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:45:47
How can you be so sure it won't affect Bitcoin? If BU forks off with 75% of the hash rate, whatever your definition of "Bitcoin" is, it will affect it. 
I'm assuming in that case you will not regard the longest chain (BU) as Bitcoin. But even then it will still diminish the security of the Core chain by 75% for at least some time. Furthermore the Core chain will have to wait 4x longer for it's blocks to get mined for at least one difficulty adjustment period, reducing utility. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:57:32
I disagree. I think a lot of software is developed by extremely potent people in their free time. Arguably, paying people to do things produces less optimal outcomes.
@_date: 2017-03-29 07:04:57
I agree that that is the case. But at the same time it's also the case that nodes want a secure network, so they follow miners. How this balance of two forces play out in practice is something we can discuss. But so many people seem to forget that it's not just the miners following the nodes. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:57:00
You think the two are exclusive? I come from a psychology background and "even" I catch myself groupthinking every now and then.
Also I believe the censorship on this subreddit and the treatment of Gavin Andreessen are evidence of groupthink in crypto.

Nodes are way cheaper to fake than hashing power. Also "economic majority" consensus is much easier to fake than hashing power.

I don't understand why it is such a big deal for a person to change his mind over the course of 7 years about the outcome of an unprecedented experiment like Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-08 14:20:58
Some alternatives that are nearly free are Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, Bitcoin cash etc. 
Network effects and 'brand' recognition for Bitcoin have been eroding heavily over the past months because people like you fail to see the power of markets.
Users don't care that much about 100% decentralisation (if you can even argue that BTC is more decentralised than any of these), they care about cheap, fast and reliable TX.
@_date: 2017-01-15 07:29:55

No, the way the market works is that it seeks for cheaper alternatives at all times. Markets are willing to do trade-offs between security and costs, especially when this increases user experience. 
This graph is not representing very well the drop of Bitcoin's market dominance from 90% to 45% of the last year.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:32:30

Crippling the on chain transaction layer of Bitcoin to a ridiculously low and arbitrary 1MB block size every 10 minutes is actually much more detrimental to the currency if you take in to account the enormous amount of competition there is amongst cryptocurrencies. 
I believe Bitcoin will be a dinosaur amongst decentralised digital currencies in a matter of years if it doesn't get over its hard-fork-o-phobia.
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:06:43
By subsidy you mean blockreward right? If I'm understanding that correctly then by increasing the subsidy they would immediately undermine the 21mil cap, which is what gives Bitcoin its scarcity and is a huge pillar for what drives the Bitcoin price up. Undermining this will probably result in more than half of the people selling their Bitcoins immediately.

From a physics perspective it is definitely nothing like cash I agree. But I think we ought to look at the two from an economic perspective. The economic freedom that the two ways of transacting give are definitely overlapping for a big part. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:52:32
Satoshi was definitely not a God. He was also allegedly not a very good programmer.
However, the way Satoshi described the future of Bitcoin in the white paper was global scaling with full nodes run in data-centres. This is what a lot of the old Bitcoiners signed up for, and which is now being changed to crippling full nodes to a degree where they can be run on raspberry pi's and using second layer scaling solutions.
Although second layer scaling solutions are definitely interesting, other cryptocurrencies are actually scaling in the proven old fashioned way through on-chain scaling while experimenting with second layer solutions on the side. This is likely why we are seeing so much of Bitcoin's market dominance diminishing.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:12:04

Great, so I will just disregard your earlier point. Now let's move on to your next point:


Because he is willing to support the software development of a wallet? If that means pumping a coin than Blockstream is a pumping company.


So what? His main fight is still for Bitcoin to be the leading cryptocurrency. He believes Bitcoin Cash is a better solution to the scaling problem, but if you take network effects and first mover advantage in to consideration Bitcoin Cash still should be approached with a healthy amount of skepticism.  
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:34:17


This is exactly what is happening right now in Bitcoin Cash. A lot of the time miners simply mine on whats best. But if the very coin that their industry is running on is damaged by the protocol they might invest money so that in the longer term they won't be sitting on a warehouse full of useless miners.


Because if 1 miner has control of the protocol, one of the main fundamental properties of the coin, censorship resistance, is endangered. This would hurt their business.

My bad, Satoshi mentioned this in the [mailing]( list.
I agree that merchants benefit enough from running a full node in order for it to make sense though.


I never talked about volume. But if you want to talk volume, please have a look at this [chart]( comparing volume between ETH (which you mentioned) &amp; BTC.
And here is another [chart]( where you can compare their respective TX fees.
Regardless, most of the competing cryptocurrencies have solved the scaling issues through better governance models, or simply less extreme views within the community with regards to decentralisation. And they did this *before* their blocks got full.


Of course, this is no surprise. The bigger the cryptocurrency the more data needs to be stored and verified by full nodes. I don't think we need &gt;1000 full nodes once we reach worldwide adoption rates, as long as they are well distributed globally. There is no way any one government is able to shut all of those down, and I'm sure as soon as they start attempting to, people all around the globe will start investing in specialised hardware to run a node, for the sake of their beloved cryptocurrency.

I agree that it used to be mainly a fear of centralisation. But I think a lot of people now realise that 2MB blocks are not going to harm the network. 
But since Segwit has already been developed by now it would be a lot of time wasted on that insanely complex product if we could just safely hard fork up to 2MB to solve the congestion problem.
I think that's part of the reason the narrative of this sub has moved from fear of centralisation to fear of "contentious" hard forks. 
Either way, centralisation is not really a problem if you believe that not every user on the network should be running its own node. There has never been any risk involved with SPV clients checking full nodes. You only really need to run a full node when you are running an exchange or a bitcoin accepting business, or when you are a miner. If we increase the block size and let every possible user transact on-chain we would likely have a tremendous influx of new nodes like these on the network, actually increasing decentralisation.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:25:44
Let's say we doubled the blocksize to 2MB. Wouldn't that substantially increase throughput of transactions and make room for a lot of more people using bitcoin? I'd argue that that would increase the total amount of nodes and thus security
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:45:40
And Monero hard-forks every 6 months without every causing a chain split.
Boy, it's amazing what a cryptocurrency can achieve once you leave behind you the people that don't understand basic economics and are only focused on every single user being able to run a full node on a raspberry pie, pricing out the poorer half of the world population from financial inclusion.

I feel like both holding and spending bitcoins will result in a price increase in bitcoin. The first action will do so by increasing scarcity, the second action will increase price by utility and network effect. However, the scarcity is a fake one, because eventually all holders can potentially sell and this can occur like a snowball effect (e.g. the bubble popping). So holding and spending both add to a bitcoin price raise, but I think only the latter is a rational price raise.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:14:32
Theres a bit of semantics going in here. By "bigger blocks", the big blockists mean "blocks that are seen by nodes as &gt;1MB". Segwit is a different way of scaling than an increase of the 1MB cap.

I think in order to retain uncensored and decentralized digital cash we do need it to be on-chain, at least for now. Off-chain scaling seems very interesting though. We need scaling this instance though, we are "losing customers" as we speak due to full blocks. We have scaled by increasing the block size many times in the past. The only difference now is that it would be through a hard fork, which brings extra risk.

The same logic applies here, and the same strawman argument is coming from you again. No, I don't think we should raise that limit to 100TB right now. But how about we just double it so we can keep the adoption rate going at the speed it was going before we hit the network capacity limit. That will give us some more time to implement all kinds of cool other features. This has been said many times before: we need to scale both on-chain and off-chain. But either way scaling is extremely urgent right now because we're losing some of Bitcoin's most important use cases (fast and cheap), so let's use our tested on-chain scaling method right now and follow up with off-chain solutions later.

Can you name one hard-fork that caused trouble, except for Ethereum's DAO hard-fork?
Monero gets hard-forked every 6 months without any problems, even Ethereum hard-forked successfully a couple of times. Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment time makes it much harder to maintain two chains at the same time compared to Ethereum, and is therefore safer to hard-fork.

63% are opposed.
Thanks for the answer. These seem like very exact numbers. Are these the result of some measurement?


This is not clear to me. Short term profits would be trying to raise fees. Currently 95% of the miners are supporting an increase in blocksize, immediately alleviating congestion, lowering fees.
I agree we have to be careful with people grabbing too much power in this ecosystem, but miners seem to be way more interested in making the coin valuable (usable) than in reeking in short term fees (look at what happened with Ghash in 2014). 
There is also one person in control of the keys for the Core github. That could also be seen as an extreme power grab over Bitcoin. I think however that that person should be seen as a proxy for many other Core devs. Just as miners could be seen as a proxy for what users/businesses want.
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:31:45

This is an absolute statement that would mean that I as an individual can forever stop Bitcoin from hard-forking. 
I'm sure that's not what you are trying to say, and that's why I formulated the question this way. I know it can be a tricky answer, but I was hoping to get a better response from you.
Also: do you value mining power *at all* as a proxy of community support?
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:46:55

@_date: 2017-10-10 16:22:56


I agree with this. My follow up question would be what your best guestimate would be of the numbers here -- what % of the community do you feel like is supporting S2X for example, and what % is needed for the community to successfully block the hard fork?


I disagree with this part. The incentives have always been that miners should act greedy, and the greediest way for them to act is to raise the value of the coin, big part of which is acting based on community will (building trust, scaling, not getting &gt;50% hashrate share). 
If we don't trust the greed of the miners I think this system is doomed to fail. It will probably never reach enough consensus to upgrade, especially since we don't have any sybil proof way of measuring this.

Don't forget that we have been welding body sections onto the bus as soon as it got full, ever since the bus first started moving passengers in 2009. This has worked every single time. 
This time when the bus got full, people refused to make it bigger and came up with a completely different solution that not a lot of people understand. But if all the passengers buy a special kind of ticket and every bus in the company uses this new form of transporting passengers, we might just be able to move twice as many passengers in a couple of months. And more importantly: "all the garages love it!". 
Which is strange because if all the garages love it why wouldn't the factories build these busses? 
Everyone can start a garage or even rent a couple of them. But to build a whole bus factory takes much more investment so the factories are likely to have a more deep understanding of how to solve this problem. 
Meanwhile there have been so many passengers left behind that even if the luggage-to-rooftop solution were to be used now, the busses would still not be able to move all the passengers. That's why most passengers are now calling other busstations which have prepared themselves more adequately for busy days like these.

I went to that website to check your claims. You're right about the last two months showing stable fees. If you zoom out a little though, you will see a different story.
I set the dates on the chart from January 1st this year until now. Here's what I got:
- 2017-01-01: 74 satoshi/byte
- 2017-05-05: 184 satoshi/byte
That is a 2.5x increase, I wouldn't call that a stable fee market even though considering the last two months have been stable.

I think that's a bit misleading. Yes in theory a $5000 bitcoin price would mean a 3.5x increase of the value of 1 satoshi. But in practice those higher fees would cause users to make less transactions and that would cause less fee competition resulting in lower fees.

I specifically said "MAX_BLOCKSIZE", referring to the parameter in the code causing the network congestion and poor UX right now. I know Segwit might increase the blocksize to 1.7MB-2.3MB if we're lucky, but I think we will reach that bottleneck again pretty quick. Even with RSK since it still requires on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:44:47
Some people think it needs to become a currency for it to be a safe store of value. 
I think Bitcoin wouldn't have to be a currency if it wasn't for other cryptocurrencies, because it would always have a lot more going for it than plain ol' fiat. But now that it has competing blockchains which are actually better prepared to handle scaling, I think Bitcoin as purely a store of value is no longer viable.
Also I don't think people should say stuff like "BTC aims to.."
Just state your opinion as your opinion but don't be that guy that knows what Bitcoin is aiming to be.

Is this your first week in crypto's? Bitcoin has been losing its market dominance to alts tremendously for the last 6 months. It went down from 85% to 40%.

More importantly though, let's talk now and -- looking at that chart, consider the possibility that Bitcoin is losing it's edge because of its current deadlock in the scaling debate. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:06:26
That's only if the Bitcoin price stays more or less the same. If we manage scale properly over the next 10 to 15 years (high throughput and low fees) the price of a bitcoin can easily double every 4 years, keeping block rewards just as profitable if not more profitable.
On top of that if the throughput of the network rises, the fees that miners get on top of the block reward can become higher than it is now, with cheaper transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:09:17

This was true for a very long time, and still is true to some extend. At what point (in % of BTC market dominance) do you think this is no longer the case though?
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:17:50
Most people that think a blocksize increase is a good idea are not opposed to the idea of layers on top of bitcoin, at all. We just don't think we have the time to discuss + develop + test + implement these technologies because of competition. Especially since we don't really now how user-friendly and secure these second layer solutions will be. It would be much safer to experiment with those technologies when the network is not congested.
Also, do you think a 1MB non-witness blocksize is big enough for all on chain transactions + opening/closing channels for the layers on top?
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:08:11
There will always be only 1 Ethereum. But if you want a fork you're free to gather support and fork the chain sure.

I doubt that. Miners are heavily incentivised to keep the network healthy since their revenue depends for 80% on the price of BTC. That's how Bitcoin was intended to work and I still believe that's how it's working today.
I think Bitcoin was experiencing a huge wave of newcomers which bloated the network, effectively pushing people to cheaper alternatives, causing the gigantic rise of altcoin prices.
Regardless of what really happened though, the fact is that Bitcoin can handle roughly 3TX/s with it's current 1MB cap. If we want mass adoption we are going to need waaay bigger blocks and 2nd layer scaling solutions such as LN. 
However, it seems that because of a combination of decentralisation fetishism and lack of governance, this will likely not happen without a fork in the network.

@_date: 2017-07-07 14:50:46
That only proofs that TX can't be free. It doesn't proof that TX should be expensive. 
If we reach an era where we have to rely solely on TX fees as revenue for the miners, I see two scenario's:
1. We are still sticking with the 1MB blocks because we never got our act together and upgraded the network in fear of a hard fork. The small amount of TX fitting in these 1MB blocks have to pay for the entire security of the Bitcoin network, resulting in huuuge fees which nobody is going to pay when there are way cheaper alternatives. 
2. We upgraded our network (oh boy, luke-jr had to shut down his raspberri pi, but at least people in Africa can afford participating Bitcoin). Blocksizes are now adjusted accordingly by miners to adapt to the growing amount of users. The huge amounts of fees collected by the miners every block is now spread out over many more users resulting in a healthy fee market.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:42:15
Many of the Core developers have openly stated that the high network fees in the recent months are not a problem and even necessary for Bitcoin.
That's "unwilling to scale Bitcoin" enough for me.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:00:49
We don't know exactly how much Segwit will allow Bitcoin to scale. If everything goes according to plan we could reach blocksizes of around 2MB, in like half a year. That's a horrible chain to be on, especially because this chain will likely never hardfork to a bigger blocksize. To me it seems very unlikely that the UASF will get a significant amount of hashing power.
Meanwhile, the legacy chain will be much more supportive of the 8 year old and tested scaling solution (on-chain scaling), after the UASF supporters fork themselves off the chain.
In the end everybody will get the chain that they want so this I consider a good thing for Bitcoin.
Also, there's no evidence of Bitmain using covert asicboost AFAIK. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

You are making an awful lot of absolute statements.


Nobody has 100% authority of the Bitcoin blockchain, but there's definitely groups of people with more power than others. For example Wladimir van der Laan holds the keys to the Github repository. He alone can veto any update that happens there.
Sure, the entire community could move over to another Github project to sidestep him, but that doesn't take away the fact that his decision influences the ease at which the code is implemented in the project.
A better example would be some of the more prominent Core developers such as Gregory Maxwell and Luke-jr. They are definitely influential because they have been writing code for the project for such a long time and people respect their views. 
Another way to control Bitcoin is to control the flow of information and discussion around certain topics, by censorship.


The fact that Segwit was relying on 95% miner signaling proofs that they actually do have this veto power, we can even see that veto power effectively blocking Segwit for the last 6 months. You could argue that in the end the users will activate it, but until now they definitely have showed to have a lot of influence in the system.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:59:45

@_date: 2017-05-18 03:31:37
Nice generalisation there. What do you even mean by "other camp"? Do you mean the people that don't agree with implementing Segwit the exact same way as you want it to be implemented? 
There's plenty of people, including me, that see the benefits of Segwit. We just don't think it's a solution to the problem that we have RIGHT NOW. 
In our opinion the problem could be elegantly and immediately solved by increasing the blocksize with a hard-fork to 2MB + Segwit. 
If we just implement Segwit through Softfork, in my opinion we will not even be able to reach enough capacity for the upcoming demand, and more importantly it will take too long to reach it's full potential anyway. We don't have enough time, people are going to use alternatives if we don't solve the problem now.
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:50:39


The first big spikes in the mempool size started happening at the start of this year:
Since the start of this year the Bitcoin price has gone x2.5
Fees went up, meanwhile people moved to altcoins which all skyrocketed, partly also because people saw this as a second chance of not missing the boat I think. 
But regardless of these statistics it also makes a lot of economical sense: the more expensive a transaction is, the less people will want to use it. And utility is an important factor in cryptocurrencies. 
Of course Bitcoin still beats altcoins in some aspects. For example it has been running steadily for 8 years and has a very strong first mover advantage. But both of those traits erode over time.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:15:52
Well there's no need to scream. 
Maybe we can at least all agree that there are multiple forces at work here. 
Bigger blocks would require more expensive hardware and internet connections, putting downward pressure on node count.
Bigger blocks would also allow for more adoption and therefore more exchanges/companies/hobbyists wanting to validate their own transactions, causing a rise in node count.
Personally I believe that we don't need that many nodes around the world. With just 100 nodes from big companies that have their reputation at stake, we will probably not see any censoring of transactions, nor can any government easily shut all 100 of them down if they are located throughout multiple countries.
Not saying we should aim for a tradeoff where we end up with 100 nodes. Just saying that it's important to keep in mind that with fiat we only had 1 node (the bank). Proper decentralisation doesn't require every grandma being able to run a fully validating node on their raspberry pi.
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:49:30
Ethereum is constantly scaling through a form of emergent consensus amongst miners raising their gas limits. 
Bitcoin, after 2 years of toxic infighting, just managed to agree on a 1.7x increase of TX throughput through some weird soft fork hack, by promising a x2 increase of the blocksize which is probably going lead to a chainsplit now that people are going to try to back out of the agreement.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:49:05
First of all that sounds like a lot of speculation, would love to see some evidence for these claims before I believe them.
Secondly, even if that is true, wouldn't that mean that Bitmain has an even bigger incentive to keep the Bitcoin network healthy? He probably thinks high fees are scaring people away to altcoins (see what happened to Bitcoin's market dominance when the blocks got full?) and is voting, with his hashpower, the way Bitcoin was intended to work, for bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:20:40
Organically? I would argue an organic fee market would rise from a market-based demand &amp; supply. In the current case of Bitcoin the supply is artificially kept at 1MB for fear of hard forks and centralisation.
Anyways, the fact that some of Core's most prominent Bitcoin developers see 5$ fees and their reaction is that it bodes well for the future, while the Bitcoin market dominance falls from 85% to 40% within 2 months, me and many others see that as economical ignorance.
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:23:51


The fact that BU exists completely disproves this point. Unless ofcourse, if you define experts as "people that share my opinion".


I wasn't aware of that statistic, that's a fair point. However, it's not a sybil proof metric. Also, there's only 87 companies on that list. 
That was actually the first thing I read when I heard about Segwit. I was initially in favour of the concept. I mean, how can you oppose all those upgrades? 
Ironically, after doing some homework I discovered that Bitcoin doesn't need any of those upgrades right now. It needs to scale immediately, and the best way to do that is by increasing the blocksize like we have been doing for the last 8 years which always worked like a charm.

That doesn't answer the question, unless your answer is "there is no point". In which case I disagree with you. 
I'm pretty sure if Bitcoin goes to 5% of the market share it will not be the crypto market space "brand". Similar to how Myspace is not the social media market space "brand" anymore.
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:23:03
If it was Bitcoin they're after, wouldn't that decrease the price of XRP and increase the price of BTC? We see the opposite happening right now.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:45:22
At what level of network congestion do you think should we make a call? How high do the fees have to get before we stop debating about it and actually do something?
I agree optimising is important, I'm simply arguing that the decentralisation of the network is being taken way too far.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:43:10
Please go ahead and make my day
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:55:47
I don't think so. People refused to pay those absurd fees and either stopped using Bitcoin or moved to altcoins. That's what the empirical evidence suggests at least.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:30:16
You mean people that wrote messy smart contracts and stored millions in there are losing money? Better blame Ethereum for giving them the freedom to do so.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:22:17
That would definitely be a nice discussion. I would also like to hear from the community what the minimum costs to run a node should be. I think those two metrics are sometimes the crux of the discussion.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:50:58
I don't think too many of them sold all of their bitcoins, but a lot of them definitely started diversifying. 
I also think many newcomers to the space are less maximalist on Bitcoin and might not even see it as that special of a cryptocurrency anymore, and dive straight in to altcoins. Partly this is due to the fact that they "missed the boat" on Bitcoin, but it's also because some altcoins are just superior to Bitcoin in certain aspects.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:31:21
I'm not trolling. Care to explain why you think that's false?
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:30:08
Yeah this interview was almost impossible to sit through, I can only imagine how it must have been to actually have to sit there for what is probably not his first annoying interview that week.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:57:58
Wow, I really respect Jimmy Song and I think he's a pretty cool guy, but these arguments are not convincing to me at all.


Why don't we lower the blocksize more? The Bitcoin restaurant will be even more successful! 


The fact that BTC/USD is going up only tells us that fiat money is shitty, which we already acknowledged a couple of years ago. This is no reason to believe that it will remain a relevant cryptocurrency.


Fair enough, not a lot of the investors in Ethereum for example are buying Ether to use smart contracts. But hey it's cheaper and faster and in the future we might find a lot of usecases for these contracts.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:51:05
I think an even more important factor in play is the free market of cryptocurrencies, that Bitcoin makes part of. If we really want a bitcoin to have value it has to have a better balance between decentralisation and utility than its competitors.
Currently the path that the Core developers are taking is one of very low utility (hoping this will be cured in the future by Segwit + Lightning Network) and very high decentralisation. 
By choosing such an extreme position Bitcoin risks losing marketshare to other cryptocurrencies that seem to have a more interesting balance. Empirically, this is exactly what seems to have happened if you look at Bitcoin's [market-dominance]( (the blocks became full around the end of 2016).
This is all assuming that if blocks get over 1MB (which is an incredibly small and arbitrary number) it will negatively hurt decentralisation. Many people believe that an increase in Bitcoin's utility will lead to an increase in usage and therefore more merchants/exchanges/fanatics will run nodes and have their own miners.
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:00:56
Please show me some evidence. Also I think you should be careful in assuming that you know peoples ideologies. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:59:04
If it fails and the majority of the miners agree upon hard forking to avoid failure I sure hope they do so.
@_date: 2017-07-10 13:23:43
Thanks. By "fully owned" do you mean that all of that pool's hashing power is under control by Bitmain? If I were to buy an S9 I could not point my hashrate towards that pool since it's closed?
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:39:26


You probably didn't mean this literally, but this is of course way off. If selling an S9 provides enough revenue to manufacture two more S9's there would only be one mining pool by now.
Although I would like to see more competition in the chip manufacturer business, I don't think buying S9's is harming decentralisation. It would only harm decentralisation if for every S9 sold, Bitmain would be able to manufacture (and run) at least one S9 themselves, from the revenue. 
If their revenue per sold S9 doesn't meet the cost of manufacturing and running their own S9 (which it doesn't even come close to), every S9 bought from Bitmain would actually benefit mining decentralisation. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:04:48
Wow I didn't know that idea actually came originally from Satoshi, what a clever man/woman/bunch.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:44:49
Are you saying you don't think exchanges are a good way of measuring the value of cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:21:35


So much this.
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:08:21
Fees are necessary =! high fees are necessary
The fact that Core wants to use Segwit and LN as scaling solutions implies that they are not as worried as they should be about scaling Bitcoin. Both these solutions are already way too late, haven't been implemented yet and even if fully implemented will run in to the same congestion problems again very soon.
We are going to have to hard fork to bigger blocks eventually, and it's much better to do it sooner than later.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:55:27
That's why I was hoping for a way to approximate these metrics ourself. "Effective influence" is too vague of a metric.
I still believe in the original governance mechanism for bitcoin, in which the miners vote on the software with their hashing power. This could be undermined if &gt;50% of the mining power was under the control of one company, or worse, one individual. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:31:24
A bigger block-size, so you can do cheap, on-chain, peer-to-peer transactions on a bigger scale immediately.
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:34:48
I just gave you 3 examples of why they would perform better on this scale compared to Bitcoin. 
Segwit and LN don't seem to be implemented any time soon.
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:07:57
Understanding the concept, yes. He has said many times that he isn't against layer two scaling. He just thinks that the market should decide on what layer to use. If you force people on to off-chain layers it could push people on to competing cryptocurrencies that aren't crippled on the first layer.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:28:23
How the hell did you find that evidence in this video?
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:43:02
If altcoins give a higher return on investment doesn't that make them better investments?
What makes you think the altcoins are going to crash harder than Bitcoin? Some altcoins are much more interesting with regards to scalability/governance/smart contracts. Bitcoin is still the most battle-hardened, longest running and most valuable system. But it's also kind of a dinosaur amongst its competitors.
Taking a maximalist approach on these analysis seems a bit closed minded, even if you believe that this is a zero-sum, winner-takes-all scenario, in the long run.
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:46:40
You don't need a smart contract to make payments on Ethereum
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:08:24


Yet he talks about Bitcoin never being intended to be just a settlement-layer.
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:28:07
Yes I do. I'm not sure what you mean by a vested interest. Sure mining has become more centralised in to industrial mining operations. But it's still decentralised and secure, and more important: sybil proof. Unless you believe Bitmain is in control of all of their globally shipped S9's.
This was actually how Bitcoin was intended to function. Here's a quote from the whitepaper:


Now I'm not saying this is holy scripture, but it is the vision that a lot of people signed up for. So calling it a bizarre idea seems like a bit of a stretch.
@_date: 2017-06-10 09:07:56
You seem to think that inability to change and not following merchant needs are good things, that's probably the crux of our disagreement. 
The truth is that it's hard to change Bitcoin right now. We will probably either see a fork between the "store of value" and "digital cash", or an even longer stalemate resulting in "digital cash" people moving to altcoins. 
Either way the market will resolve these issues and everybody will get what they want (a Lamborghini) 
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:10:17
What exactly is the value proposition of bitcoin? I think there are a couple, one of them being "hard to tamper with". 
The point that I'm making however is that this value proposition is being taken to such lengths that it's significantly lowering other value propositions such as "cheap" and "fast". 
Even "security" is arguably lower because the bigger the transaction backlog the easier it becomes to double-spend.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:18:43
I agree with you that the mere existence of fees forces people to come up with creative ways of lowering transaction bloat. However, those pressures are way too high right now, and the off-chain scaling solutions are not implemented yet. So now what we are seeing is that altcoins are being used as our off-chain solution.
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:20:10
What do you mean by "under Jihans control"?
Mining pools are merely proxies for miners to send their hashpower to if they agree with the pool's terms and conditions with regards to signaling and mining rewards.
Jihan doesn't hold any "control" over these miners. If he does something they don't like they will just point their S9's to a different pool.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:14:13


So if a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin is deemed more valuable by the market that means the market doesn't trust it? That sounds like Bitcoin maximalism to me.
@_date: 2017-06-10 09:16:51
Can you provide any evidence for this claim?
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:29:58
Nope, blockchains are pretty inefficient I'll give you that, but saying the fees are always going to be high is like saying we will never be able to send pictures over the internet. It's just a matter of trade-off (for now)
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:42:04
Because with hashing power you actually proof that you are invested in the system (hardware, electricity, rent, maintenance). Making bad decisions will directly ruin your investments.
On the other hand, anybody can spin up a bunch of nodes in a data center for much less money and call it a "grass roots user movement", whilst actually not risking a significant amount of money. 
I'm not trying to be a dick but did anybody in here actually read the whitepaper? This is Bitcoin 101.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:23:10
Read it again and try to see if you might have missed the point.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:55:19
I think this chart shows that it's already happening in a significant way. And it makes sense, consumers will favour $0,05 fees over $3.
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:31:38
So you're saying that miners have to take into consideration what users want? I agree, a chain with a lot of hashing power but no users isn't very valuable.
On the other hand I think that users also have to take into consideration what miners want. A chain with many users but no security is also worthless. 
Do you agree that this works at least both ways?
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:37:00


You can agree or disagree with miner voting, but it was exactly what the inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, had in mind:


Users, wallets, exchanges and developers should also have a say in the development ofcourse. But miner votes are at least sybil proof, meaning real money is lost if they make bad decisions. Something like a UASF movement is not sybil proof and can be faked much easier.
If I was a malicious actor trying to destroy Bitcoin I would know which approach I'd try first.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:47:46
Well that's just the way competition works, no reason to fear that. Just invest accordingly
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:39:47


These were not just a bunch of individuals, but rather the representatives of some of the biggest companies from the five constituencies of the consensus mechanism underlying Bitcoin.
These companies have huge incentives to keep the Bitcoin network healthy (that means low fees, and decentralised). I think compromising all of these companies and then using them to burn down Bitcoin to the ground is a lot harder than you might think. 
Especially with the mining pools. Remember that these pools are not "in control" of all the hashing power they represent. If they would for example support a silly hardfork that would remove the 21mil cap, most of their miners would probably switch to a mining pool that isn't destroying one of Bitcoin's most valuable traits. It's better to see mining pools as proxies for miners.
I admire your skepticism though.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:10:07


Do you think that is their only purpose in Bitcoin? Do you think that hashing power should not be used to vote on software implementations or rules?
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:52:44


But those are all traits that other cryptocurrencies share. You could argue they're not on the same level yet because Bitcoin has been running for a longer time and has a higher hashrate, but those gaps are becoming smaller. New cryptocurrencies also have an advantage over Bitcoin, namely that they can learn from it's shortcomings. I'm hinting at governance and block-time/block-size here. 


I agree that centralisation tends to be faster and cheaper. But I think we can have both really fast and really cheap cryptocurrency payments that are still very secure. I think decentralisation is sometimes being taken too far in Bitcoin (raspberry pi nodes) which make it very heavy to reach these levels of visa though.


Then why were so many merchants accepting zero-conf transactions as valid? I guess it was good enough for them, but it isn't anymore, eroding an important utility of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:20:07
If PoS turns out to work just as good or better than PoW, then probably yes.
Until then, this is likely more less energy consuming than all banks combined on the globe.
