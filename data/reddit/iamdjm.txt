This isn't massively different than taking than taking a loan from a traditional bank today, investing in secondary market (high risk) and expecting higher returns than the interest you pay. Except that SALT doesn't care about your credit history or rating as long as you have the crypto assets.
What's interesting is, both you and SALT are betting on the same thing i.e. the Crypto assets (collateral) to go up because if those assets crash and you don't pay back, they are screwed too.

the big dogs get to bet on or against bitcoins without actually buying or selling bitcoins.. i.e. futures market is open.

A futures contract is a financial contract giving the buyer an obligation to purchase an asset (and the seller an obligation to sell an asset) at a set price at a future point in time.
The assets often underlying futures contracts include commodities, stocks, and bonds. Grain, precious metals, electricity, oil, beef, orange juice,and natural gas are traditional examples of commodities, but foreign currencies, emissions credits, bandwidth and certain financial instruments are also part of today's commodity markets.
There are two kinds of participants in futures markets: hedgers and speculators. Hedgers do not usually seek a profit by trading commodities futures but rather seek to stabilize the revenues or costs of their business operations. Speculators are usually not interested in taking possession of the underlying assets. They essentially place bets on the future prices of certain commodities. Speculators are often blamed for big price swings in the futures markets, but they also provide a lot of liquidity to the futures markets.

If you bought it more than 10 days ago (like me), sell half BTC at 15k and HODL rest, buy back in again once it dips below 10k. 
Use the profit you make to invest in other cryptos. 
BTC is certainly revolutionary, no denying that, but i am not entirely convinced it is for the masses and has practical applications (yet). Sure Wilkenvoss wants the world to believe it’s the gold and it will go into millions - btc made them billionaires, i would believe that too if I were them. There are other promising cryptos who can change we do business and buy coffee.
BTC price is a tug of war between FOMO and FUD. And exchanges are the ones who will make money out of it, while rest of us HODL. 
P.s: this is not a financial advice. I do hold BTC and other cryptos.

there is still time, sell 50% now and buy back at 10k..HODL the rest.

So players in the Futures market don't buy/sell BTC but bet on it's direction. So in theory the price of BTC go up and down depending on what the BTC community thinks and not the people who are not even buying BTCs. 
I have never traded futures so pardon my ignorance. Maybe someone can dumb it down for me. 
P.S: i sold BTC at ATH and waiting for correction to get back in at &lt;7k.

when enough of us start selling 50% ;)
Imagine, the guys who own billion $ worth will short bitcoins on the futures and then sell it, so they make profit both ways and who's screwed?

Here's a likely scenario. People like the Winklevoss' will short the BTC on the exchange, and at the same time, sell their BTC worth millions -  hence creating panic leading to a drop, they take the profit from sell and the short and then buy it back in as the price drops, earning millions more. This is way more lucrative for them then sitting on a billion dollar stash of BTCs.
