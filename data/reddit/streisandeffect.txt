When I started using Copay, GreenAddress only supported 2of3 addresses with hardware wallets and more m of n options were still in development. I haven't circled back to see what GreenAddress' options are these days as I had never had an issue with my Copay setup until now.

Will do, still emailing back and forth with Copay devs diagnosing. They've been very helpful. I'll post the solution here when resolved for anyone else who may stumble upon the same issue.

Copay is an open source bitcoin wallet ( available for pretty much any device you can think of. It has been my wallet of choice for over 2 years.       
       
Multisignature wallets (a feature of not only Copay, but other Bitcoin wallets as well) allow for multiple parties to control a Bitcoin wallet. For example, in a 3 of 5 multisig wallet, 5 people (or could just be 5 different devices you own) have keys to the wallet. Any 3 of those keys need to sign a transaction. If you lose one or two, or they're stolen/broken, etc. there is no loss or security risk as long as you still have 3 of them.

The bug has been fixed. The issue ended up being difficult to diagnose, but an easy fix. The bug only presented itself when importing a HW wallet from the device, in a multsig wallet, with an account number greater than 1. The updated version 3.5.1 has now fixed this issue. Funds no longer frozen! The devs were a huge help.

Thank you for your assistance. I'm aware you have many other issues, and I know this is not a paid service but rather an open source project. That said, after 2 weeks without access to the funds in this wallet, I wanted to at least warn others who may have a similar wallet setup and be at risk for whatever caused this issue. I didn't consider the possibility that if I needed my funds in a timely manor, I probably need to have my own bitcore wallet service running to be sure. This information might be helpful to others who see this post later. Again, thank you, and hopefully the solution ends up being rather simple. Is there a donation address for copay development?
