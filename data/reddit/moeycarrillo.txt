He is struggling for $50 right now.. it’s not feasible at this point to make a huge investment for OP. He could in turn every week put $100 in and have more “purchase power” per whichever crypto he decides to invest in assuming it goes up, but he just doesn’t have the capital right now. I’m giving him the baby steps procedure to hopefully help his livelihood in the next few years.

It’s all good buddy, just buy a little more next time! :)

No. I'm all in on BTC. It's the biggest coin out there, Sure, other coins out there have different uses and even better technology surrounding them.. but Bitcoin has 5x the market cap of ethereum. It's CLOSEST competitor. And yeah they serve different purposes but I think Bitcoin is getting to the point where it's too big to just die off entirely. I think we have a bigger safety net than most people think. This all speculation of course but I feel pretty comfortable about it. We may have significant crashes along the way, but that's part of growing something monumental in my opinion. Bitcoin is yet to even scratch the surface of what it can become. Lightning network will render most alt coins and a lot of fiat obsolete.

Same could be said about people that are born into wealthy families. I tend to try to make the best out of my own situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:04:13
as long as SOME are still in circulation which there would be.. your asking the impossible they would only go up more. Besides Satoshi has at least a million he can dump back in for us ;) lol. Interesting thought i had was that if die hard fans that don't want anyone knowing or having their keys DIE after awhile that'd be a lot of coins lost!
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:56:27
Storm being massive crash, or skyrocket prices?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:08:23
Just wait for Lightning network.. Look at coinbase/GDAX a fully developed exchange! They get congested all the time when there are mad volume spikes and transactions going on. Bitcoin is fundamentally the same and the developers are trying to fix this, on a GLOBAL scale. It has to be tested thoroughly otherwise people could lose their coins. Give it time.. and once it's 100% successful you'll see MANY alt coins rendered obsolete.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:31
I honestly have no idea what is going on at this point? You guys think it manipulated growth or organic? 
Also where can I see what countries are buying up the most BTC right now?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:20:21
I bought at $7400.. $2K worth... it hurt a bit, but I had faith. This is just a waiting game. It’s gonna take a lot to bring BTC down at this point IMHO. Even at a BAD correction I only see it going down to maybe $3-4K. If it does crash it’s gonna suck big time, but I’m at the point now where I want to join the 21 Million Club and from there it’s either $200k or bust. No in between at this point.

lol poor souls.. I tell everyone all the time- "use your phone for more than just piddling on social apps, you can learn practically anything you want on the damn thing in an instant!"
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:44
I don't like saying exact numbers, but I'm pretty close to a whole BTC. A little anxious cus I'm WAY up right now. I don't want a significant correction to get me back at break even. Debating selling and shorting but obviously thats not always the best idea.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:05:51
Completely understand brother. I'm fortunate enough to have literally put my entire savings in around the 6-10k mark. So I'm very close but with these increases it just absurd and I can't keep up :( I know it wasn't the wisest thing in the world but I'll tell you what.. I can make Sub $10k back. It may take time but is feasible.. But if bitcoin goes even $100k+.. that's not so easy working a 9-5 so I'm risking it. Will start saving probably 60/40 in fiat/crypto entering 2018 though.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:07:27
That was my main concern. A very well coordinated attempt to dismantle bitcoin. Not sure how it could happen, I’ve had a few scenarios play out in my head but getting everyone on board to do that just doesn’t seem very plausible. If I understand correctly, everyone shorting bitcoin in a future has someone betting equally against them but on the long side correct? 
If that’s true, that means many people would also balance the chance for a turn for the worst. Bitcoin is a very strong force, I don’t think it’ll be easy for the opposers. But I do know that it’s in the fetal stages of threatening the economic systems in place. And I know they don’t want to give up the throne that easily either.

I would suggest learning some sort of trade, and/or working another part time at night for a minimum of 6months where you can make at least $100 a week after tax. Save that all. You should have roughly $2600 by the end. Sacrifice now, for a better outcome tomorrow. With those $2600 i would go all in on a crypto asset that you beileve in. Possibly Litecoin, ripple, Monero, or something. Be prepared to wait 3 years and pretend you’ve already lost your money. Take a break. Now in these 3 years of waiting do the same again. Work 6 months out of the year part time on top of your full time where you can make $100-200 extra a week and save it ALL. Live very simply. Now in these 3 years of work you’ve acquired roughly $7500-10,000 dollars AND your initial investment could be worth $10k easily. Only a 4x which in crypto isn’t very much. Possibly $20K. Then you could get entirely of debt besides maybe your living arrangement, and go to school to learn a trade and possibly double your income now. Be patient. That is key. Life is very long and even 50 years old is young. Think of Ray Kroc where he built McDonald’s at age 50+. Nothing great is built overnight. I wish you the best, you just have to be willing to sacrifice NOW, for tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:11:38
around $2k and i made about 3 of those on top with other little bits here and there 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:07:42
Takes time and patience brother. Just keep your head up and keep trying! You’ll get there!
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:14:54
I read this one earlier today. Kind of funny how they are increasing the FUD, but at the very bottom they disclose that CME is an investor in Digital Currency Group, a subsidiary of CoinDesk. Just a tad suspicious.. probably to push weak hands to sell. But what do I know. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:34:15
I have thousands invested and to be honest if people panic that much they either:
1) Bought more than they should have. 
2) Don’t believe in the tech enough. 
Just be patient. Pretends it’s your favorite sports team playing. They’re down a little, but there’s still a whole quarter left. If you cash out now sure you lost, but your team can ALWAYS come back. I’m no fortune teller, but you aren’t winning or losing until you cash out. And only you can determine if you’ll take the loss, or wait long enough to see if your team wins. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:11:46
Well that’s why I said Litecoin, ripple, monero, or something else for him to invest in. I feel anything less than .5 BTC won’t make enormous gains in the long run. Good gains but not monstrous like we all want lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:31:25
You sir, are genius. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:53:03
Why would you want to cry over another man's wealth? Work, create your own, and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Never worry about what another person has, it only takes away from what you could be achieving. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:46:28
We may see a considerable dip brother.. hang tight and lets see what happens. For now, I'm HODLING.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:02:27
took me about 8-12 hours to transfer from coinbase to Ledger. As long as the address is good you're fine!
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:11:48
It's not a high horse, it's the truth.. This doesn't even apply to Bitcoin, but the entire world as we know it. Example: I see people on twitter/facebook all the time asking publicly the most "basic" questions. For example- how to cut a mango. By the time you tweeted that, waited for a response if you get one at all, you could have watched a 50 second youtube video and learned. My thing is we have an unlimited and incredible resource at our disposal and MANY don't use it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:08:33
$5750, $6400, $7400, $9400, and $10,800
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:50:22
Why would you only buy 1 measly dollar? The transfer fee alone is probably 4x the dollar value. The minimum I would dollar cost average is $20 to your own personal increments of time. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:49
I love seeing my gains, but in my journey to collect as much BTC as I can seeing this dramatic of an increase is a little disheartening. I want to join the 21 million club but damn does this spike make it hard to do.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:12:48
Risk you have to take currently. It sucks and I don’t like it either but bitcoin is just a store of value right now. YOU CAN purchase with it, but why would you when you can just see it grow? Buy stuff with Litecoin instead via overstock.com. But bitcoin is gold right now. A safe place to store value, and I’d argue to say that in the future will be FAR better than cash in a bank. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:54:09
Big facts. I'm 22 and getting closer and closer! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:01:19
Thanks for the input, and you make a very solid point about it. Darwin’s theory at its finest in crypto. I’m eager to see where it all goes, only time will tell! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:29:28
It’s about 80% jokingly lol. Are you upset?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:35
I’m SPECULATING a pump and dump and they’re gonna short futures contracts to START OFF raking in a good amount right off gate in profits. Then trade all the way up to whatever the ceiling is and do normal trades along with possible coordinated pumps again here and there. I’m just on the fence to sell or not and jump back in.. I’d hate to see it somehow just skyrocket past $20k and this is truly just the hyper bitcoinization of society and we’re truly just seeing adoption from the masses!! These next few months will be interesting to see to say the very least. I just don’t wanna be a weak hand, and miss out on this. HODLING has proven very successful thus far
