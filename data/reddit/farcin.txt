Was built from scratch, no templates.

Would definitely appreciate it if you guys looked around and gave any suggestions. Since payments are accepted in Bitcoin, I threw in a discount for all buyers.

Thanks, I took a look at this earlier. Unfortunately, as of now there doesn't seem to be anyway I can make a product display itself as sold out nor is there any quantity options once a customer purchases it.
I also can't seem to customize the iFrame nor include a terms and agreement text field or any additional input fields. It's close however.

You shouldn't have sold at a loss. That honestly makes no sense.

People shouldn’t be buying BTC with credit and that’s a fact.
Use your debit card and bank and you’ll be fine.

It's almost like they tried and are still trying, don't forget:
Don't fall for the FUD.

Nice, I think that's the one I was looking for earlier. Is it production ready?

They rejected me with no explanation. Weird.

Link isn't working, any alternatives?

You can just use the app Blockfolio in the app store, much easier.

After ditching Bitpay, we finally found a solution to get rid of the middlemen!

So how would you have a customer order? Have a bitcoin address and then have the customer email customer support?
Not sure that there is a platform that allows that to streamline in an e-commerce with ease.
