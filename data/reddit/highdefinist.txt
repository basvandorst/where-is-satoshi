This is good news - overall. Sure, it could have been better, but given the circumstances, this is about the best thing which could have happened.
It still remains to be seen what will happen to MT balances, and if it will be possible to withdraw BCC. But I guess they will figure out the former, and the latter would just be a nice bonus on top.
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:52:43
On the other hand, BTC-e customers might see their money before MtGox customers, and also likely a greater percentage of it.

In Germany, you would not have to pay any taxes - assuming you held onto these Bitcoins for at least one year. Considering how much money you have, you might consider changing your citizenship.

I am indeed starting to believe that it is a disadvantage to be born with American citizenship... because, as a foreigner, I can go visit the United States with no problem, yet I do not have to deal with any taxation problems either.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:54:38
That's not quite correct. Germany has a relatively high capital gains tax (25% + Solidaritätszuschlag = ~28%), **but** Bitcoin does not count as "capital", therefore you don't have to pay any taxes on its gain (if you held onto it for at least a year).
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:26:30
I believe the time between each transaction has to be at least one year.

There will never ever be a "Bitcoin hard fork". 
Bcash is just the beginning - from now on there will be many hard forks to create various new variants of Bitcoin - basically the Altcoin 2.0 age. This will confuse people for a while, because they will not know what the "real Bitcoin" is, until there will be a consensus that the real Bitcoin is the non-hardforked one. And this also means that any hardforks, unless done by overwhelming consensus, will not be accepted as Bitcoin. This means that the Segwit2X fork will not be "Bitcoin" but instead "Bitcoin2X" or something, but that even any hard forks done by Bitcoin Core in the future will be much harder to push through.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:44:21
True. For long-term Bitcoin hodlers (basically, the economic majority), a two-month long Bitcoin crash with excessive fees (somewhat mitigated by Segwit, however), is not a showstopper, but just a temporary inconvenience.
Miners, on the other hand, cannot survive without income for two months. So after a few days, I expect the hash rate to quickly return to at least 50% of what it was before.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:15:58
Don't forget to add an "Exodus-block", where you are transferring 1k BCUABC or 1M or whatever to a wallet of your choice, before you release the code for everyone to mine on.

Even so... what does it really matter if they know who owns how many Bitcoins? Even in their claim against BTC-e they stated they are not against Bitcoin in general.

However, a few of the really large whales may have something to hide, so in terms of volume, who knows... this might also help speed up the buyback of the BTE tokens - if everything really does play out like it (hopefully) will.

On the other hand, they probably spent a significant amount of money on designing, developing and testing Bitcoin miners which are now no more efficient than other miners, or potentially less efficient or even useless. 
Maybe it is still a net positive for them, but as long as that patch is implemented and enforced relatively soon, I would not count on it.
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:05:51
You are missing the point.
This particular "optimization" is incompatible with Segwit. That is the problem.
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:38:50
Does Asicboost require all mined blocks to be empty, or do only some of the mined blocks end up empty?
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:15:35
Look, just... read up more about this stuff, before your entire argument is essentially based on your misunderstanding of what "attacking a hash function" means.
You can start here, for example: 
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:27:42
Which concerns are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:19:05
It is not very likely that Bitmains new miners support Segwit-compatible hashing at all. Removing that logic from their silicon dies is likely responsible for the efficiency gain in the first place.
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:47:54
Bitmain uses Asicboost, but other miners do not use Asicboost.
With Segwit, Asicboost will no longer work. Therefore, Bitmain has a strong incentive to block Segwit (they will lose hashrate), but other miners have a strong incentive to push Segwit (their hashrate will become more valuable, when Bitmain can no longer use Asicboost, and the block difficulty goes down).
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:59:29
But can this reuse be done in software? To me it sounds like it is such a low-level part of the algorithm that it must be a part of the silicon die in order to run efficiently. And then, this hashing hardware solution is only able to accept blocks which fulfill those restrictions (as in: No segwit).
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:17:13
I am not really convinced... isn't supporting UASF essentially supporting the lesser evil - the greater evil being stalled progress due do miners who want to have more power?
I believe that UASF also helps in clearing up the misunderstanding that the signaling methodology used in the original Segwit activation proposal is "voting on a proposal", when it is really just there to guarantee a smooth transition.
Yes, UASF would not be smooth. But I believe we are in a situation where there is simply no smooth way forwards, at all...
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:33:00
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:03:12
A year from now, with no Segwit transition, maybe yes. But, it seems that existing mining hardware cannot simply be upgraded to Asicboost. So, right now the majority of miners would support Segwit based on economic incentives.
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:49:43
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:16:04
Why wouldn't they? Pools are withholding Bitcoin-Segwit for purely political reasons - not because they actually think that Segwit is bad.
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:10:40
1. True, but in terms of "how much hash rate do I get per money spent on mining hardware", cheaper and faster are the same thing.
2. That is not very likely. For example, GPUs with double precision support are significantly more expensive to produce than GPUs without double precision support (when comparing two GPUs with the same single precision performance), as the cost of a GPU is (roughly) proportional to their die area, and leaving out double precision circuits saves some die area. Assuming that Bitmain plans to maximize their profit, their Asicboost miners might not even have the hardware to do Segwit-compatible hashing, as simply fitting more hash computers on the same silicon die area improves both their hash rate and reduces the electricity consumption, per production cost.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:50:01


In what way? Is there any reason not to implement a UASF as soon as possible?
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:52:31
Well, yes, any statement about the Segwit-hashrate of Bitmains Asicboost miners is an assumption, so there is no evidence either way. I believe it is almost certain the hashrate will be significantly lower, and relatively likely that it will zero - because it would allow them to maximize their non-Segwit profit.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:51:53
It is incompatible with Segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:14:10
You are welcome!
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:15:41
In order to fit more hash rate on the same silicon die area, their new miners may not even have the necessary logic to do Segwit-compatible hashing.
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:33:52
"Attack on Bitcoin"? What are you talking about?
Gregory Maxwell talks about an "attack on Bitcoins hash function". 
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:28:37
Indeed. It is not even clear whether Bitmains Asicboost miners support a non-Asicboost mode, because the electricity savings are likely due to "taking shortcuts on the silicon", as their solution is likely completely in hardware (to maximize efficiency), and not in software.
Even if their mining hardware supports a non-Asicboost mode, they will likely have to disable some hash-rate in order to avoid thermal or power supply problems.
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:09:32
"Attack on a hash function" = "Solving a hash function with fewer computations than intended"
That's just how the English language works. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:44:55
As far as I understood him, he is not arguing for delaying UASF to a later date, but to somehow "soften" it, for example by allowing non-Segwit blocks post activation. But can this really work? What about LA unspent transactions? What about incentivizing Segwit-averse miners to upgrade?
Basically, as long as there is no better alternative to UASF (in the sense that it is ready to be deployed), we should continue to push it.
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:34:19
2 MB blocks would double the operating cost for node operators. Why should they support that?

And noone is claiming that "optimizations" are bad *in general*. That is your strawman right here. It is bad *in this specific instance*, because this particular "optimization" is incompatible with Segwit.

I would rather have Bitcoin Core put their undivided attention to the technology behind Bitcoin. I see no problem in leaving the job of communication to other people, such as Samson Mow.

Seriously, most of the answers in this thread are just plain stupid and missing the point in adressing OPs flawed comparison...
Look: SharpMud is using a logical fallacy called "a strawman" to confuse you. Asicboost being more efficient is not the problem - Asicboost not being compatible with Segwit is the problem! It gives users of Asicboost - like Bitmain - a perverse incentive to block Bitcoin progress, which hurts all of our investments.
So, Asicboost is bad because it blocks progress and costs us money - nothing more, nothing less.
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:47:07
I think this is, essentially, the best possible solution.
No matter how much we may personally dislike Jihan Wu et al., the stability of the Bitcoin system is more important than getting new features out as quickly as possible. July 2018 seems far away, but I would rather wait a while, and have Segwit activate safely, than risk any chain splits, hard forks, or other issues. In the mean time, Litecoin (and others) will  prove to anyone not trusting Bitcoin Core that Segwit is safe and ready for deployment.
Since Segwit is also effectively a block size increase, without the downside of requiring a hard fork, there is really no reason at all for big blockers to block Segwit. Yes, it only increases the effective block size to around 2 MB, rather than the 8 MB or more which many big blockers want, but it does so without any of the risks associated with hard forks. Only if Segwit turns out to be insufficient to solve congestion, a block size increase hard-fork should be seriously considered.

I somehow managed to sell 10% of my Bitcoin at the absolute low point of this year (~ 730$). I rebought them soon afterwards, so the loss is minimal, but the same pattern repeated itself a few more times... still, these strange impulsive actions somehow gave me some clarity every time I did them. 
Still, I believe it is sometimes justified to deviate from the rules one has set for themselves, as long as the degree of this deviation is proportional to the strength of the justification. For me, going 25% into Litecoin believing they might activate Segwit was a good decision.

Every minute, that miners spend not mining Bitcoin means that they lose an amount of money equivalent to 1.25 Bitcoins... so I do not believe they would keep this up for very long, because it would be extremely expensive for them.

Yeah, this implies a very high probability that my Bitcoins on BTC-e are gone... it sucks, but then again, I knowingly took the risk.
I guess it's still possible that the person being arrested is related to BitMixer.io (which, conincidentally, also stopped working just a few days ago), but it is much more likely, that this is one of the BTC-e owners.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:18:30
No need for profanity. I understand that this is a very emotional topic, but frankly, your choice of words is just childish.
Also, it has not "been coming for years"! Hardly any nodes are compatible with the Segwit2X hard fork. Introducing it at such a short notice is dangerous and will lead to a chain split.
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:02:30
Well, obviously the miners perceived it as a serious threat - otherwise there would not have been the NYA.
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:53:38
If you want to use cash, use Litecoin, or any of the other Altcoins today. Most of them have sub-cent transactions costs - none of the Bitcoin hardfork proposals can compete with that.
But Bitcoin still has almost 50% market cap because it has one thing no Altcoin has: Trust and stability. If you make a hard fork which splits the chain, you lose that, and Bitcoins only remaining unique selling point.
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:00:06
But he also said:


Basically, it means two things:
- There should be a block size increase at some point
- It **must not** be rushed, but planned way ahead of time. Three months (as is the case for Segwit2X), is too soon.
Also, things have changed dramatically since then. In terms of volume, Bitcoin has primarily become a store of value, not a way of transacting value. Considering that gold has a market cap of $7 trillion, while Visa is worth just $250 billion, it clearly makes more sense to compete with gold rather than with Visa (or Paypal), in terms of features. And this means: Prioritize stability, above all else - even if that means high transaction costs.
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:42:48
No, it does not have to. People can just switch back to Bitcoin Core after Segwit is activated.

@_date: 2017-07-18 23:02:24
To give them at least some credit: The Segwit 95% is very high, probably too high. This makes BIP91 or BIP148 almost mandatory to activate Segwit in time.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:16:11
Almost all of the existing nodes are running Bitcoin Core. They are incompatible with the Segwit2X-hard fork. Therefore, Segwit2X is a danger to the Bitcoin network, because it will lead to a chain split.
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:30:51
Your comparison is false, because Core never agreed to Segwit2X.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:04:36
Nonsense. If that really was a serious option for them, then why didn't they do that?
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:47:48
Well, has anyone really checked the BCC client source code? And checked whether the binary matches the source code? There could be backdoors. Sure, it's extremely unlikely, but still... it might not be worth the risk, if you are convinced that BCC will be worth almost nothing anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:08:47
Well, as far as I understand the Lightning network, people do one Segwit transaction to connect their wallet to a payment processor, and then handle multiple transactions through that payment processor. They need to trust their payment processor only with those coins which they choose to send to or receive from the payment processor after connecting themselves to it, and they can terminate this connection at any time. So it seems that it is a way to combine multiple transactions of one person to one (or two) transactions on the blockchain.
But maybe what you describe is also possible (combining similar transactions of different people). Basically, there will be various ways of balancing the security of a transaction, and its transaction cost, some which may have yet to be discovered.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:34:40
Wow. Once again, the incompetence of the miners and their development team is astonishing. 
It seems like they did not run any simulations at all, because surely something like this would quickly show up.
Still, it seems like everything will be ok, because of this relay network.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:13:15
But then what is the "compromise"? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:18:22
Perhaps the greatest weakness of the Bitcoin network is that there is no inherent benefit to running a node, quite unlike mining and its block rewards. Node owners act out of pure altruism for the Bitcoin community.
But this also means that if running a node becomes more expensive, there will be fewer nodes, putting even more strain on the remaining nodes, until eventually relatively few central nodes are left. This also means that if a government outlaws Bitcoin, it will become very hard (or impossible) for people in that country to still use Bitcoin, because it will become more difficult to hide the necessary hardware and internet traffic to run a node. At that point, Bitcoin will lose much of its Gold 2.0 abilities.
Of course, high transaction fees are also a serious problem - but yes, therefore, I believe that turning the blockchain into a settlement layer, and putting "regular" transactions off the blockchain, is the best solution, overall.
That does not mean that the block size must never ever be increased - but I believe most people strongly underestimate the problems that this will cause, while strongly underestimating the potential of Segwit, and whatever Softfork comes after Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:52:40
Considering his income is based on producing Bitcoin mining hardware, this would seriously harm him...
So basically, your scenario is possible, but very unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:49:26
Sure, but it still means that there is very little to gain from a hard fork, and very much to lose. So, Segwit without block size increase is the ideal compromise: You improve Bitcoins cash abilities, without risking any of the gold abilities.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:47:16
Calling me a snowflake when you are the one getting emotional? Oh well... not my problem.
But just to be clear: Of course I support Segwit - but I am against reckless hard forks, and therefore oppose the "2X"-part of "Segwit2X".
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:31:35
Sure, but what does it matter if Bitcoin has 95% of the cryptocurrency space, if the cryptocurrency space itself is tiny compared to all the other markets out there?
It makes more sense to compete with gold than with Paypal or Litecoin, because the market cap of gold is much higher. And becoming gold 2.0 requires two things above all else: Trust and stability. If Bitcoin can manage that, a market cap of $2 trillion 10-15 years from now is realistic, considering that gold has $7 trillion, yet significant practical disadvantages compared to Bitcoin.
But I do not believe it is realistic to aim even higher than that (governments will make sure that Bitcoin will not be able to seriously interfere with central banks), so if you compromise too much to become Paypal 2.0, another Altcoin will eventually become Paypal 3.0, and then it's over for Bitcoin.
But yes, it seems we have different views. I am not interested in any particular vision, but simply think about what must be done to maximize the value (montary and in terms of usability) of Bitcoin. Therefore, Segwit is great, to get more people to use Bitcoin in general, but blocksize increases must be handled extremely conservatively.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:45:24


They **seem** to have moved to BTC-e coldwallets. Who knows, maybe BTC-e has some kind of special, manual procedures laid out when such huge amounts of Bitcoins are incoming? Considering this is really the only "evidence" linking BTC-e to Gox directly, this is not really convincing.


And I have sympathy for you, and your desire to find those who are guilty of what happened, but there is simply not enough evidence to implicate BTC-e. The real criminals are those who hacked MtGox - but not those who chose to not check the origins of the Bitcoins which they received.
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:13:52
Of course, I fully agree that stability must come first - far ahead of Segwit.
However, I do believe that the Bitcoin developers should have been able to predict, that this 95% rule might be misunderstood as voting.
Also, 95% means that there are quite a few pools with veto power, or near-veto power, so all it takes is a very small minority to prevent Segwit, for whatever more or less valid reason.
At the same time, if most of the hash rate is fake signaling, as in pools which allow blocks with invalid Segwit transactions because they cannot check if a Segwit transaction is valid, it could still lead to a chain split. (At least that is how I understand it - please correct me if I am wrong) 
To me, it would make the most sense to use BIP91 as an activation mechanism, plus much more time (so nodes are upgraded), plus a way to make fake signaling impractical (e.g. signaling blocks must contain certain hash codes, which are computed in such a way that it requires the functionality of being able to distinguish between valid and invalid Segwit transactions. Then, fake-signaling would essentially be just as complex as upgrading the client, so noone would do it anymore. Not sure if that really makes sense, but it's an idea I just had).
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:25:08
No, transactions can only be done if both parties agree to it. Otherwise it would be no different from sending someone your private key, which would be obviously a bad idea...
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:39:44
Probably not, as there are enough UASF nodes to make sure that UASF miners can see each other.
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:28:34
To be realistic, there is about a 95% chance that those of us who had Bitcoins on BTC-e will never see them again.
Nevertheless, about those 5%: If they hosted their server in the U.S., then their "data center issue" tweet is actually accurate - and they could theoretically be back 5-10 days from now, after moving their backups to a new server. Also, their server probably did not contain the private keys to their cold storage, because that would be too risky in any case. So, they probably still have their cryptocurrencies, or the vast majority of them.
Also, if I was them, I would rather pay the $110M fine than run and risk getting sentenced for life like the other guy... Considering they made about $1M/day in transaction fees, they actually might have that much available, and even if they don't, they could do a haircut like Bitfinex, and survive and continue.
Of course, there are many many "ifs" involved, so I give them only 5%, but it is not impossible.
@_date: 2017-07-18 11:35:21
But what would they gain from BitcoinABC? I don't think they are so stupid to not realize that they need, at the very least, support from the other Chinese miners, if they want BitcoinABC to have any chance of succeeding.
Btw.: They just mined a sw2x block, so I guess that settles it.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:41:27
No this is incorrect!
The problem will reappear everytime a new non-BIP91 block is mined.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:29:32
They probably own too many Bitcoins to effectively short the market.
Also, any disruption caused by them will also have a subtle longterm effect on the value of Bitcoin, as people will generally trust Bitcoin less, further harming them.
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:03:53
They have little to gain from not signaling, and much to lose. Also, in case of Litecoin, ViaBTC was also late, for whatever reason, but followed through on their Segwit-signaling regardless.

What is so bad about it being a settlement layer anyway? I never understood that point.

The NYA is non-binding backdoor deal, without the input or consent of Bitcoin Core. It was created for the sole purpose of saving the miners face, after they stalled Bitcoin progress for **8 months**, and caused huge amounts of money to move to Etherium, Litecoin, and other Altcoins.
I do not believe these miners are malicious - but they are supremely incompetent, as they could not even get BIP91 to work reliably without the help of Bitcoin Core (
Does anyone really believe they could successfully pull off a hard fork - and in three months no less? These people are a joke. Let's just be happy they finally got around and made Bitcoin scaling possible, and hope, that they learned their lesson and will not try to interfere with Bitcoin in the future again.

- Running nodes becomes more expensive due to more traffic cost. This leads to centralization which makes it easier for governments to control Bitcoin
- Increasing the block size requires a hard fork, which is relatively risky and takes a lot of preparation
- In terms of volume, Bitcoin is mostly used as a store of value, so high transaction fees are much less of a problem than one would intuitively think. Gold is much more valuable than Paypal, so Bitcoin should try to become Gold 2.0, rather than Paypal 2.0.
- There are options to "increase the block size without actually increasing it", such as Segwit: It allows more transactions, but without a hard fork, and is fully backwards compatible. There may be more options beyond Segwit in the future.

As far as I understand it: Smaller blocks, so that the load on nodes remains the same.

That sounds like they are only referring to hotwallets.

I hope not. But they are also partially responsible for this mess by allowing the "voting by hash power"-narrative to gain so much momentum.
In July/August, when Segwit (hopefully) activates, anyone who just uses Bitcoin Core is safe (aside from a temporary higher than usual orphan rate). However, the 2 MB hard fork a few months later is much more dangerous. If the miners really withdraw 80% of the total hash power for their hard fork, it would stall the entire Bitcoin network, and if they use some of their hash power to attack the Bitcoin network, it would render it unusable. This kind of attack would also be extremely expensive for them, but even if they just keep it up for a few days, it could cause irreparable harm to the trust in Bitcoin. Of course, if the Bitcoin value crashes, it harms them more than anyone else, but judging by their previous decisions, they probably really are too stupid to understand that...
Core really has to prepare for that - whether that means preparing an emergency patch with a partial PoW change, faster difficulty adaptation, or something else, I do not know. But they **have** to figure something out!

The problem is that Bitcoin should not be about "finding a compromise", but "finding the best solution". This is achieved through peer review, open discussion, and technical arguments. Segwit2x is none of these things: It was agreed upon in a closed door meeting, without any of the core developers.
It really does not do anything useful on to top of what BIP 141 by Core was supposed to do. It exists simply for the miners to save face, and gain ~~control~~ respect.
That being said, it will hopefully get Segwit activated, without any hard fork, while also being compatible with BIP148, therefore preventing a chain split. Even more importantly, it is compatible with people running core nodes. They will temporarily observe a higher-than-usual orphan rate, but I believe this is a relatively minor problem.

Well, their ideas are the only reasonable ones...
