he is no man of honor, and has more debts to pay,
he is a scammer, see for yourself
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:37:04

more than I like Charlie ?
@_date: 2016-03-31 18:34:36
I like how he is caring and generous, he might even give me my money back...
@_date: 2015-01-27 11:49:13
I paid for the privilege of making such post for you :)

basically, he admires a bigger crook than himself
and later advises to make sure not to screw anyone over, when you do busyness, 
what a joke...
guy scammed me for 36 btc
@_date: 2016-03-31 18:32:01
yeah, 
he pioneered me all right
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:35:14
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:37:27
he is probably not trolling, nor am I
 
since you are refunding everyone, maybe it is my turn also ?
@_date: 2016-11-29 23:14:57
How about returning me my 36 btc, Charlie ?
@_date: 2016-09-22 14:54:24
please ask him about this
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:58:54
well, just to chime in, 
he is not working on it with me...
actually, he is "working me" over
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:11:55
what do you think ?
check this address :
still 36 btc short, not to mention his self imposed interest on delayed payment
All I can say to him is : HANG in there, Charlie
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:11:15
thanx Slayer706,  you summed it up pretty much to the letter, I will add that I called him out early that he will try to do just this, 
defuse the situation and hope it just gets forgotten
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:49:05
he counts on me not going there , I doubt I can do something about it in my country
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:15:23
he owes me money too...
@_date: 2016-07-20 21:15:26
he still owes me some coins...
@_date: 2016-07-20 21:14:33
how about my money, Charlie ?
nice to see you out, but before enjoying small things, maybe take care of bigger things ?
