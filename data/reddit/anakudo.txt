Is it just a matter of copying and pasting their HTML code into my website editor? 
Also, do any of these charge me for using their service if I get no sales?

I'm calling right now.
EDIT: Holy shit. He's legit.

Tell him to use COINBASE. It instantly takes his bitcoins and turns it into money in his bank for free, he doesn't need to hold them. It's like taking euros and instantly converting them to USD for free

Sure, buddy.

start looking. How much more does a crepe cost than a lemonade in that store?

You do realize Bitcoin has transaction fees too, right?

So you don't believe the article, but when it's to your convenience - you do.

If you do the transaction properly, there's no reason it wouldn't confirm.

I can't believe we're proud with $700. What a sad community this has become. Actually, it was always a sad circle-jerky community. Nevermind.

Fucking finally. 
I've been looking for places to spend my Bitcoins and my girlfriend has known about Bitcoin for quite some time now and never saw a use for it because there was no way to buy food with it since in Los Angeles' Coin Map, all there is accepting BTC is rental studios, photography, etc.
I know where I'm taking my girlfriend next week.
Wow. Wut. I live like a block away from this place. How do you pay with Bitcoin there? Like, say I'm using the Blockchain app. Do I gotta scan something then input manually the amount of BTC I want to send them?
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:30:05
Checked the address, and there is no transaction that was 1BTC

How does his username prove it? I don't get it

I would like to create a small community for my show, perhaps maybe just one person will be interested enough. That will make my day, and if you are that person I will be happy to work with you in terms of suggestions from now on.

My dad is an angel investor, perhaps he could help you. Pm me.

Yeah...that's a scam
