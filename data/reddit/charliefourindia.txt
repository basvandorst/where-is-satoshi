OK, since I see the link stating the best that could happen is .02 for 24hrs, what other alt coins would offer the best return on the victim's investment given the server environment of AWS?
Full Disclosure, I write for [InfoSec News]( and I'm trying to understand what the economic motivations are for scanning GitHub and starting instances to mine coins on AWS infrastructure for future stories.
Thanks!

TOR only provides you with pseudonymity, if you're doing something sketchy expecting anonymity by using TOR, then plan for a visit from the 4chan Party Van sometime in the future.

Great advice from 2014 
The tl;dr, TOR doesn't provide anonymity. 
P.S. Use Google images to find out what the 4Chan Party Van is.

There's always money to be made by people that don't believe the sky has a chance to fall.
Take a read of this from Marketwatch [Auto sales at risk as defaults of subprime loans rise]( and then read The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's 
[PDF of the Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit (August 2016)]
* Auto loan balances reached $1.1 trillion, a $32 billion increase. Auto loan delinquency rates were flat, with 3.5% of auto loan
balances 90 or more days delinquent.
Its brewing, but way too many people have their eyes glued to this charlie foxtrot of an election, and Kim Kardashian's ass.

I'd love to see where the subprime auto loan bubble is right about now as that's brewing to pop really really bad.
