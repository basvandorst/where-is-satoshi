Cash is harder to move yes but is more anonymous. All bitcoin transactions are visible on the blockchain. If terrorists would use bitcoin it would be easier to follow the money and catch the big guys.

What wallet are you using to scan the QR Code? It says opening Zap? Is that your lightning wallet?

Can we join? We could help with a fiat ramp. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:55:52
No because if bitcoin was used it would be easier to determine the money stream and catch the guys who financed the attack. Terrorist would be stupid to use bitcoin. Cash is better for them.

Great. Thanks a lot guys. Will try those out. Is there a way to start with testnet first?
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:23:00
Good luck. You must understand better than any of us what you think the Greeks will vote in the referendum. Looks like here  most are thinking it will be a no vote. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:21:48
How will  bet on the referendum pan out?  You can see what people think here: 
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:15:15
It's too late for the Greeks. The rally might be people buying that don't want to end up in the same situation as the Greeks.

It is not a good idea to have large amounts of data (which you need for event descriptions) on a blockchain. 
You guys should design this as follows. Have a centralised database for the event data that is owned by a DAO (digital autonomous organisation). Access to the database is controlled via API'S that get issued via the blockchain. To post in the database requires a fee. The fees go to the DAO which pays its hosting from it.

What makes you think this will grow the economy? If the pound drops and therefore we sell more.  We still receive the same or less in actual buying power.

Who will win the German Grand Prix of 2014? Lewis Hamilton must face Nico Rosberg's vociferous German support at Hockenheim this weekend. Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa will be confident of challenging for a podium place after Bottas finished third in Austria and second at Silverstone.

I think this is a great idea and I would be glad to help. Just a quick question. How would I as a user be sure that the owner of the hotspot doesn't steal my passwords,  etc.
@_date: 2014-10-07 06:05:06
Can't belive there were even people still selling below the bearwhale....

This is great. I am gonna check them all out
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:58:27
I had wiring issues with them as well but luckily they were resolved. Bought on btce for 280, selling on bitstamp for 300, nice

You mean as in how quickly Heart bleed got discovered? 
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:54:30
I agree with this but saying it has to happen will not make it happen. Let's select an idea and work on it together. I am happy to help. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:12:11
Is really great to see people contributing something rather than complaining that the price doesn't go up. The only way the price will go up is if people make a contribution to the eco system. Thanks for this! 
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:03:29
I think indeed the problem is the other way around. People are frustrated they can't get money into stamp or other exchanges fast enough as price is rising. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 15:44:39
Better to short on Bitcoin than to hedge with gold or silver. Faster and with lower fees. That is why bitcoin will succeed. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:21:56
basi8cally they become 2 different coins. Most people assume one of the coins will disappear because it will not have enough miners supporting it. However some core developers are already worried about too much miner centralization and considering to change the PoW. Candidate code is already written:  Coins that you buy before the fork will be valid on both chains. This will only work when both forks survive but the probability of that is not zero anymore
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:33:24
You are correct and it doesnt double your coins. If Bitcoin forks it splits in two coins e.g. BitcoinCore and let me call it ClassicCoin as it is debatable which coin you could calll Bitcoin. The fork will only happen if 75% of the miners say they will support ClassicCoin. Now most people think that if this fork is successful the remaining 25% of the miners will also support ClassicCoin and BitcoinCore will have not much hashpower protecting the network and therefore die. However there is a possibility that the 25% of miners supporting BitcoinCore dont switch and that both chains can continue. 25% of the hashpower is still much more than most other altcoins. See overview here:  However it might be theoretically possible i believe its a highly unlikely and also undesirable scenario. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 03:05:24
Could you elaborate on this? How can I use a different token for the transactions? We have a use case where we need something like USDT over lightning.  
@_date: 2019-03-23 07:18:23
Ok. Thanks for helping me try this out.  I have downloaded the wallet and opened a channel with LNBig. Those two steps were very simple.
I had to wait for about 1 hour to be able to create an invoice.  I then send the invoice to the tipbot by sending !withdraw followed by my invoice.  However then nothing happened.  
I must be doing something wrong.  Any idea? I will update when I have figured it out.  
But this looks rather easy indeed. Thanks for promoting this. 
Update: I received a message from the bot. It says unable to find a path to destination. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 03:27:33
If I have funds somewhere else why do I need to send BTC to receive them? Does this wallet work on testnet?  I prefer to use my testnet bitcoins to try things out. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 03:38:09
Great idea. I might have access to a billboard in a football stadium. So you can send during the match. Would love to help.

Sounds great. Can i try this using testnet first?
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:52:28
No it's the same as buying 1 kilogram of gold vs 1000 gram. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:59:33
Fantastic. Will try it and let you know how it went for me. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:32:47
This is great. Many thanks for sharing this. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:52:41
Blocks have two rewards: coinbase rewards that will disappear after we reach the 21m cap and transaction fee rewards. The transaction fees are collected from all transactions in the block.  The idea is that both transactions×fees in the block will rise and this will offset the disappearing coinbase rewards. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:44:22
It was going up tooo fast so we had to put some breaks on. This is the way to do it. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:30:26
Well that is a good hedge. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 03:43:47
Very nice happy thought. Indeed don't convert to other Currencies anymore. Stay in BTC.

Great job guys. Fantastic to give us a look behind the scene.

but store of value can be an utility as well. Thats why people have been investing in gold, art, etc. Esp in high inflation countries.

Does it work on testnet? Like to try these on testnet first. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:26:53
Ok. That's great. Will do that. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:31:28
No it doesn't because they will not become worth less if you break them down further.

This is great. I am trying to do this. Managed to get multichain working but how do i get 2 nodes talking to each other on the same machine? 
@_date: 2015-11-05 09:23:11
Of course my advice is getting downvoted as this sub is full of traders. Traders make money from volatility. Traders make money when the price goes up and traders make money when it goes down. Expect a lot of bad news in this sub for a while. They want to enforce the downward trend a bit more. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 03:00:36
What a lot of people don't seem to get is that we are in the inflationary phase of bitcoin. Everyday approx 3600 new bitcoins are being created. That means that at current prices the system needs to grow everyday by approx $1m (either through new users coming in or existing users increasing their holdings). If the supply of bitcoins now reduces by 50% and the same $1m keeps flowing into the system the price will have to double.  
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:39:03
Please let me know if you found a solution. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:41:40
Ok thanks. Will try as well 
@_date: 2015-10-17 05:08:18
I am not saying that the supply is only from mining. The price remains the same because supply is equal to demand. E.g. the amount of new users coming into the system + supply from miners is equal to the amount of users leaving the system. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:00:53
Agreed. And the point he makes in the post what I like is that every time it doubles you can get your full investment back. (if you wanted too. I am not selling lol, hodl)
@_date: 2015-11-05 10:01:32
Ok fair enough. Let me add some more advice then. Don't invest more in bitcoin than you can afford to lose and if you invest only because you see the price go up have some nerves. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 18:04:47
Yeah but I am always a bit worried about btce. Have you done big amounts? 
@_date: 2015-10-17 03:33:24
Sure I agree with you. The price has been fairly stable between 200-300 so likely if nothing else changes it should go to 400-600. The market might be anticipating that and the uptrend towards it already happening.

Good one. I have a friend who works in aviation and know indeed for a fact that airline parts are used for money laundering and corrupt governments.

why did you use a separate chain? why not generate a hash of the document and store it in the bitcoin blockchain?
