The most of people holding bitcoin don't care fee, speed, and never learn how to use lightening newton. They only want skyrocketing digital gold.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:50:12
You are right. I am eager to lock my 100 BTC to LN channels to buy a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:58:34
They are sapmmer.

It's a bad news. Bigger blocks cause centralization. Devil miners must die.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:00:42
The centralization caused by Lightening/Core can solved the centralization problems caused by evil miners. Doesn't it? It's very logical.
Beautiful spike hubs
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:44:22
Nice Lightning coin. It's the future.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:00:50
Dcoin is a scam coin.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:39:52
LN will make ETH and other shitcoin irrelevant apparently. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:04:31
Spammer ran out of money to spam Bitcoin network. Let's celebrate. yay.

Don't spread FUD. We are the most intelligent people. UFO will land on the Core of this circle. Bring us to the Moon.
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:38:08
Sure, we are in a circle. There is no hub, no Core.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:57:19
Every transactions are spams. Only opening and closing lightening channels are not spams. That's what Core taught us. It's Satoshi's vision. Cheers~.
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:04:37
FUD, fee market is needed for healthy lightning network. Go lightening.

Lol. Bitcoin™ is the trademark of Blockstream. Not Satoshi Nakamoto.

Excellent~~  
3000 bits
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:50:05
1000 bits @_date: 2014-08-06 15:52:18
From Taiwan.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:00:47
There are 3000 convenience stores in Taiwan also selling Bitcoin at kiosks. Bitoex.com cooperated with FamiPort's kiosk to sell bitcoin. There are over one hundred thousand Filipino people working in Taiwan. Now, they have an easy way to send money back to Philippine.
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:06:58
I received SMS and bitcoin. Thank you for your give away.
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:30:11
Are you Taiwanese? Follow below instruction:  If you can not read Chinese. I will translate it to English. If your phone number is not located in Taiwan. Please add country code.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:31:31
Yes, the overall process is registration-free. Only needed one is your cellphone number.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:37:32
Thanks a lot. Up vote!!!
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:24:12
It caused by pushing the confirm button two times. So, there is duplicated attempts detected.
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:38:27
Good idea. But bitcoin address is longer than your cellphone number. I think it is a tedious process to typing your bitcoin address, and there is no camera at FamiPort to scan your QRcode address.

I am still translating this manga to the English. The other pages can be found in following links:

Thank you very much
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:59:38
No, but you can use following map.
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:04:35
I already did it as video did. But the kiosk only support buying bitcoin, not selling.
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:18:06
There are hundred thousands foreign workers in Taiwan. And, seven million tourists travel to Taiwan per year. There are huge potential in international remittance in Taiwan. Filipino, indonesian, Vietnamese and more foreign workers. They have cellphones but hard to access bank account. It is need to bring this information to them. Use your cellphone (not limited to Taiwan cellphone number) to send money to your home country. Via Bitcoin.
It's only charging a 1% fee (crazy!) and there's the standard NT$25 fee from the kiosk owners (about US 75 cents) At that moment, Everyone can stopped the entire meetup and ran to the nearest location in Taiwan to buy some coins!

Celebrating incoming 300Kb blocksize limit.

Custodial bank accounts are not wallets, such as "Bluewallet", "Wallet of Satoshi" and "Bitpie".

1. Sustainable  fee market.
2. Long backlog of unconfirmed transactions supporting miners for security.
3. "Proof of proof" to protect all shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-04-28 09:21:42
That's right. Higher fee means higher security. Cheap fee means no security, Like IOTA needs COO. Bcash needs hashwar. BTC only needs champagne.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:44:01
Give up. Bitcoin need to be upgraded to be Lightning Coin. It's the future.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:49:50
It's not an alt-coin. it's an upgrade. For example. if Internet is congested, we don't need to upgrade wider bandwidth. We need Lightning Internet as an upper layer. Bandwidth can not be upgrade forever. It's a simple logic. Do you understand?
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:31:37
They need to run a Lightning node. Otherwise, I can't pay them via Lightning Network. All my BTC are locked in the channel. Delete other shitcoin QRcode. Only Lightning needed.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:14:07
Internet is extremely conjested. We need lightning Internet as upper layer.
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:30:12
I am so hyped.
