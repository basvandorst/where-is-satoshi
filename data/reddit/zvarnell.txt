You may be able to only accept Paypal from people with confirmed addresses or something like that. I bought something off eBay once and had to jump through a couple hoops with Paypal first to get the seller to ship it to me.

I actually just added an 'm' to the end of the file name. On imgur it makes it medium. It also works with 's' for small 'l' for large and 'h' for huge.

I like "green address." I don't care for "marker address."

You do get 100% in gift cards. My wife cashed in some change a while back for xbox points and Amazon gift cards. Those are things we were going to spend money on anyway and it was easier than going to the bank to convert change.
