No problem, except now you're adding the overhead of buying Starbucks to all of your transactions. Fine for funsies but a shit business model.

Yep, google auth is a great idea for precisely this reason.
I set up the same thing for my Linux server--pretty slick.

I think that was the hint.

Jesus. It is your money, so do what you like, but stick to speculating on the price or businesses that you understand the value of.
A good check is: does something like this exist for cash/stocks/existing financial products. That may sound boring, but probably the reason some of the things you invested in don't exist in cash is that they would be illegal. And they are illegal because they are too likely to be scams.
Now, the point of bitcoin is that there aren't as many regulations. So probably some of the awesome things BTC can do wouldn't work in cash. And I'm not saying you have to avoid all of them. Just THINK about it before you invest.
And with regard to banks, think about the business principals at work here. For someone to deposit money in a bank and for that to make money, the bank has to loan someone else out that money, and get paid with interest. What interest rate could POSSIBLY compete with the rise in bitcoin value? Anyone who pays that amount in interest is an idiot. Ergo, there is no bitcoin lending. Ergo it makes no sense to deposit somewhere to "make money on your bitcoin balances" because you already ARE making money on your bitcoin balances.
Don't fall for get rich scams that you can rule out on principals.
