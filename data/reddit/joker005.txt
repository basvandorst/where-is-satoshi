If you are in control of the websote or a forum moderator, it is extremely effective.

And I bought shortly after the all time high (a small dip after the high). If I just waited two more weeks I would have gotten so many more coins...lol...
Oh well. I'm not concerned. Cryptocurrency is our certaint future &amp; I didn't invest any more than what I could afford to lose anyway (if those specific coins are not the future &amp; some other coin is).
I just wish I had waited until right before Aug 1st to buy in. My goodness, I'd have 2x-4x as many coins for the same price on some of these altcoins.

Double posting = even creepier.
You need help. For your own sake.
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:29:22
You are so skeptical, it makes you stupid. Or you were already stupid &amp; coincidentally are skeptical too.

OP called it. He profits, but told us morons will come in to say he is lying. It happened.
Idiot...you just fulfilled OP's prophecy.

This. People dont understand that most of the web is already HEAVILY censored.
Anytime there are moderators with the authority to delete, ban, etc. You will have censorship.
I have **never** met a moderator who didnt abuse their power through bias. And I have met &amp; observed hundreds, probably thousands of mods. Most openly do so. Many will admit to joyfully targetting community members they dislike. Mods very often join in on community trolling. I am not talking reddit; I am talking EVERYWHERE.

Why do you think the name of someone matters at all? It doesnt.
If someone said the Sky is Blue, but they were named ShitFaceHitlerFucker, would the sky suddenly turn red?
Im not saying OP is right. I just think basing it on name, rather than argument, is nonsense.

What the fuck is wrong with you? If my daughter ever ended up with a guy like you, I would fucking kill myself. What the hell went wrong in your life to become such an entitled fuck?

LOL WUT?

Proof tends to make intelligent people feel better.
I have also seen people trace bots in politics to out companies payed to perform misinformation / smear campaigns. I am taking THOUSANDS of accounts caught. So it is certainly not impossible to prove.

Getting fired from Reddit? Hmm... sorry, but that gives a big positive. Makes him look good. Reddit is that one website known for its admins befriending child rapists &amp; all that dark troll crap. No love for owners of reddit, even if the bad ones are long gone &amp; those problems long since fixed? I dont believe it. People dont change &amp; Power corrupts.
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:33:40
Yea sure...*but were you prepared for all the idiots &amp; scum in this sub?*
Although not surprising bc...reddit...bc...humans...but surprisingly still always surprising when they speak. It is almost as if redditors cannot stop lowering my faith in humanity. Their failure in logic/reason &amp; the magnitude of entitlement/assholery knows no end.

Once the solar panels are paid for, mining is pure profit from then on out. Cost of 0 makes profit at 1 cent.
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:39:57


Holy shit...are you serious?
How fucking worthless &amp; insecure are you redditors? The adding of emotion to toneless text is typical on the internet, but the horrors resulting from people's projection is insane.
Psychiatry is the future apparently because most redditors seem to have a hella fucked up ego.
Normal people dont see anything wrong. In fact, most would agree with OP "tone" because they understand how fuckin stupid &amp; insecure redditors are.

Easier said than done when mods or admins can easily see through your disguise.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:50:41
You are as creepy as you are troll-like.
Idk what it is aboit you, but the way you act has "extreme creep" written all over it. Entitled, nasty, stalking history for petty juvenile comebacks, insecure, etc. Freaky.

Logic Fail. Governments cant simply decide "Nah, that coin is gone." Governments having that much control kindof defeats the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. One of cryptos biggest strengths is its resistance/immunity to government influence.

This is a very naive &amp; honestly dumb perspective. Incorrect.
If most people live in a community, and then you censor that community, but only those censored leave, then you still have most people in that censored community.

Troll Fail.
@_date: 2017-07-09 03:30:48
Lmao... Gotta love it when someone like calls you an idiot but doesn't even know the difference between your &amp; you're. Gold!

Thanks! :)
