A device that's primary utility is typically the operation of a single lock which provides access to an asset. Keys are often metal, and are distinguishable by their blade. The unique cut of a key's blade is what allows it to fit into the lock it is designed for. I believe that shevrin2 is suggesting an a-typical use of a key, in such a way that the soft edged 'bow' of the key is used to scratch in lieu of a coin.
EDIT: I have included a picture of a key for further clarity. I hope this helps.

Bitcoin has always been heavily tied to politics, largely due to cypherpunks. Increasingly libertarians are using Bitcoin as a vehicle to promote their anti-government agenda. I find r/Bitcoin has a strong sentiment of "Remember kids, the government exists to kill us for not paying taxes." It's very difficult to discuss Bitcoin without the narrative of 'freedom' or more specifically 'freedom from government' coming up.

Alt coins are not meant to replace Bitcoin, they're meant to coexist with it. Visa and Mastercard manage to coexist, so why can't Bitcoin and &lt;x&gt; coin? The core difference between Bitcoin and altcoins is merchant support, and once you accept one Crypto it's not that hard to accept more. I could easily imagine an API that can take any form of crypto and convert it to USD using a service like Bitpay.

I have said this many times before, and I will say it again here.
Bitcoin has a chance to be truly revolutionary for the videogames industry. I have heard of indie devs going bankrupt because of chargeback fees. And as far as micro transaction fees, holy damn. Guess what the developer sees out of every $1 worth of microtransactions they handle. Cents on the dollar. That's why they try to sell those $25 gift cards at every damn petrol station.
Though OP, I think one of the best things you could do as far as allowing devs to take Bitcoin -- make a service that lets you buy Steam Wallet credit with Bitcoin. Doing this lets me buy thousands of games for Bitcoin. I think this may already exist, but there's always room for more than one kid on the block.
Also, don't be evil. I've seen numerous people trying to sell games bought through the Humble Bundle. If you do that I will cry irl.

I am not discouraging intelligent discourse, I am just suggesting that you do not need to create a new thread for every opinion you have on the matter. It would be beneficial to have a megathread rather than having upwards of 20 threads running concurrently.
EDIT: I personally don't see the need for 1,000 threads but it seems like the community does. It's more beneficial to the community to direct them to relevant content than it is to whinge about the number of threads they are creating, so I am re-purposing my post from a whinge fest into a directory.

Bitcoin was created by cypherpunks to serve a libertarian agenda. Unfortunately, libertarian voices tend to be very loud in our community, which makes us look very unattractive from an outsider perspective. Many people invested in Bitcoin are also anti Altcoin.

I would not buy Bitcoin from an organisation as large as the FBI and assume that the private keys have not been compromised. I would want those coins transferred to a wallet of my own, and so it couldn't be 'off the blockchain'. As soon as coins start leaving the FBI's wallet, which I imagine a number of people watch religiously, there will be a market reaction.

The cool thing about being a conspiracy theorist is that they place the burden of proof on everyone else. The whole thing is completely built around logical fallacy.
You can make as many outlandish claims as you want. Fuckin' pyramids? Those shits are just crashed alien satellites. Russians? Those guys are actually aliens. Banks? Literally all of them are run by descendants of the Hitler youth. Satoshi Nakamoto? Actually a pair of conjoined twins, one with an economics major and the other with a cryptography major. 
Then they get something right, and suddenly you're meant to take them a little more seriously when they tell you that 9/11 was an inside job that was necessitated because the twin towers were destroyed in WW3 in an alternate timeline, and keeping the towers in tact would ultimately lead to WW4.

When MtGox was identified as a point of failure for Bitcoin after rolling DDoS attacks in April 2013, many people moved their Bitcoin to other exchanges.

In a case like this, what are the wallets being stored on? If you're storing them on a USB, there's plenty of back doors in common USBs. You'll need to eventually enable Internet to spend the coins. With hardware there's also the point of failure involved in theft/fire/malfunction/all the regular hazard stuff. If you're printing a paper wallet, there are apparently printers that store saved jobs in memory as well as theft/fire/etc again.
The nasty thing about risk mitigation is that you're trying to prevent hazards both known and unknown.

And literally every single one of his political platforms is completely lacking in foresight. He only cares about the stats he'll see in his term so that he can get reelected.

Mining for Bitcoin or Litecoin is vastly different in terms of hardware requirements. I recommend that you check out both currencies and decide which one you like the sound of. I strongly advise against trying to mine Bitcoin unless you can ensure that you are going to get access to a new, fast miner on the first shipment.
Ultimately, I think the days of making profit from mining are nearing an end. Between all the hardware scams, it's hard to stay a step ahead of the curve.

Totally impossible. The core innovation of Bitcoin is something called 'the blockchain' which is a fancy way of making agents who should not trust each other, trust each other. As you would have mined no valid blocks in the blockchain, you'd have no coins.

The risks associated with handling Bitcoin are completely mitigated by payment processors like Bitpay. Riot would never need to touch Bitcoin if they didn't want to. All it would require on their end, would be setting up an additional payment option. Given the plethora of payment options that they support, this would not be a difficult or costly obstacle for a multinational development team.
Now, why would they go through the effort of doing that? Firstly, the majority of Bitcoin users are people who are technologically savvy, and there is likely a statistically significant overlap between League of Legends players and Bitcoin enthusiasts. They would be allowing the people who do want to pay with Bitcoin an option that competitors like Dota 2 have not offered, thereby gaining customer loyalty and increasing their competitive advantage.
Further, Riot's business model with League of Legends is based on microtransactions. A core issue with microtransactions in their present form is that a large piece of the pie is taken by the payment processors in the form of fees. While Bitpay has fees associated with it, those fees are much lower than other payment options. Videogame developers like Zynga have taken to Bitcoin because they use a microtransaction model. It stands to reason that it would benefit Riot as well. Given that other developers are starting to act on this, if any of Riot's competitors were to implement Bitcoin payment options before they do, they may be forced to surrender market share to their competitors.
But ultimately, and this is the icing on the cake, the real benefit is chargeback fees. The average gamer doesn't realise that chargeback fees are a serious threat to videogame publishers, and developers who chose to publish their own games. Every time someone issues a chargeback against you, that money is indefinitely held until the banks involved determine whether they should release the funds to the merchant. Even in the instance where the merchant does receive the funds, they are paying fees for chargebacks. In the case of microtransactions, those fees can be ten times the value of the transaction in the first place. Chargebacks are stupid. Bitcoin gives merchants protection from chargeback fraud.

Ignorance breeds contempt. Since many people here have a financial stake in Bitcoin's success, the people are often willfully ignorant about other novel uses of the blockchain.

My issue was more of a philosophical one. I should have been more implicit. If 'people should save as much as possible', then it stands to reason that *everyone* should save as much as possible. If *everyone* should save as much as possible, then *no one* should spend Bitcoin. In this scenario, *no one* would spend Bitcoin, which would result in wealth with no utility. If wealth has no utility, how is there wealth?
Though it's also probably not fair to say that Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. There are in fact very finite divisibility restrictions on Bitcoin in its present form.

I feel super safe! Zero mass shootings in Australia since we introduced gun legislation in 1996. Hugely reduced suicide rates, rates of gun violence have plummeted, number of victims of homicide in decline since 1996. Pretty awesome. I'm hardly not free just because I don't have a gun, but I *am* free from the threat of gun violence.

Perceived as expensive to outsiders? What outsiders? Do you have any statistical data, or do you just have anecdotal evidence? I'm sure I've seen instances of people saying Bitcoin is too expensive, but the value of Bitcoin is not going to change simply by changing the colloquial unit measurement. This means that a change is *not logical*.
I've noticed that in this thread, a lot of people are stating concepts as fact, yet there's no mention of number anchoring, unitosity or numerosity. There are a lot of cognitive biases when dealing with numbers, and several of them directly contradict each other. 
If anyone is trying to make a suggestion for *why* a change is necessary to a multibillion dollar market cap asset, at least back it up with an empirical construct. Granted in some instances you can deduce priori knowledge without science, (e.g. "Bachelors are not married," but you cannot deduce what currency unit should be used; there are simply too many variables.

I once voiced the (in my mind, completely reasonable) belief that drugs used in date rape should be illegal on (a blood relative of mine was drugged, raped and murdered).

This is a fairly cool thing to do, but only if there's a bar or something around. Make it a learning experience for them, and guide them through the process.
For example, if you live in a city that offers Bitcoin for booze, you could give them a wallet with enough money to buy a beer. Tell them that you've bought them a beer, they just have to figure out how to use it. Make it a fun and playful learning experience. 
For something as small as 5mBTC, you don't want them to save that Bitcoin, you want them to spend it.

I don't think the units are the problem. I think it's more likely a combination of lack of experience and lack of price stability. If $1 was equivalent to 1mBTC, then there's a strong case for mBTC. The issue is that when it starts moving away from dollar parity, people will begin getting just as confused. 
If a price is denoted in BTC but not your local currency, there's math to be done. I don't trust my brainbox to work out the math, so I've got to do a quick calculation which often involves checking for the average exchange rate price. I guess I could install a Chrome extension, but news recently has lead me to not trust Chrome extensions. I mean, I've got a whole lifetime of compounding experience knowing what $25 can buy me. What the hell can 0.345 BTC/345mBTC buy me?

Anecdotal evidence does not make their point less true.
In fact, 99% is a massive highball. With 7,000,000,000 people alive, Bitcoin would need to be supported by 70,000,000 people (three times the population of Australia) for it to be used by even 1% of the world.

Have you seen how many Overstock articles have been published since they accepted Bitcoin? Merchant support legitimatises the currency, and legitimacy increases adoption rates. It also spreads public awareness in general, which also increases adoption rates. This then triggers a domino effect, where more and more organisations are forced to accept Bitcoin, or face that they are surrendering their market share to their competitors. As more and more merchants accept Bitcoin, so too will more and more suppliers. This will eventually lead to more businesses retaining Bitcoin to pay their suppliers.
Further, many of the people who spend their Bitcoin to make a purchase will then replenish their Bitcoin with their fiat. People don't like fiat, but they don't like holding all their capital in Bitcoin either. 
tl;dr: You are simplifying a dynamic equation to one step. That is not how reality works.
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:01:09
But while you're here: As long as you consider mining 'fair use', then the warranty should cover you.
Also, you will probably lose money (cost of power) if you try to mine Bitcoin with a GPU. The network difficulty is simply far too high for a GPU to make a return on investment, much less a return on power.
If you are very keen to mine with your GPU, you may be able to mine Litecoin at a profit. If (like many in this community) you for some reason see alt coins as 'copy coins', you could still use this as an avenue for converting the Litecoin that you mine into Bitcoin using an exchange.

In general the advice around these parts is quite bad, so here's my (hopefully less bad) advice:
1: Current (high) estimates are that about 1,000,000 people own Bitcoin. 1% of the world's population is 70,000,000. If you are interested in a long position, I think this should inform you that there is a lot of room for further growth. If you are more interested in a short position, the point below will help you to mitigate that risk. Ultimately Bitcoin rose by several thousands of percent last year, and while past performance is not indicative of future results, I would expect that figure to slow down gradually rather than coming to a sudden halt. I think it is generally pretty irrelevant if you buy in January or in August, so take your time and research before you buy.
2: Base amount is irrelevant. What is more relevant is your investment strategy. Many people here are novice investors, and almost no one sticks to basic principles like [dollar cost averaging](
Ultimately the best thing that you should do when confronted with a question like "should I buy", is to research Bitcoin. Until you understand some concepts like block rewards, block reward halving, confirmations, wallets, paper wallets, security, I think that there is more to do. Definitely make sure you have read all of the Getting Started, FAQ and Common Myths section in the sidebar before you make a financial decision.
@_date: 2014-01-15 11:48:19
Ultimately how nuts you want to go with your Bitcoin security should depend on how much capital you have in Bitcoin. Both of these options seem reasonably safe, though the blockchain.info option has an obvious point of failure. I am not sure I have ever heard of taking a photo of a paper wallet and encrypting it. Seems a little redundant to me. There are many better ways to back up a paper wallet.

@_date: 2014-01-23 11:59:55
You seem uninformed.
The number of confirms required is at the discretion of the merchant. In the case of exchanges, they tend to want between four and six confirms, because they're dealing with large volumes of money.
The vast majority of all transactions are completely valid with zero confirms. So much so that agents like Bitpay will happily process something with zero confirms for merchants.
It currently takes me over a day to send money to my girlfriend's account, because we have different banks. I'm pretty sure that 60 minutes for 6 confirms is a much better option.
Also, there would be a major disadvantage to having 1 minute block times. It would reduce the entire efficiency of the mining network, and generate far more orphaned blocks.

The reason that investment professionals are 'a bit cagey here' is because investment professionals do not want to willfully relinquish their competitive advantage. Why would you willfully disclose information to your competitors?

The ASICs that work for Bitcoin will not work for Litecoin, similarly the GPU farms that work for Litecoin may not work for another coin that implements a different key-derivation function.

It could be untraceable in the sense that they do not know the origins of the Bitcoin. There are services called 'tumblers' that, in essence, take lots and lots of coins, mix them together, and then output 'clean' coins to a brand spankin' new wallet. 
However, it would be incredibly difficult to move $1m worth of Bitcoin into dollars and keep it 'untraceable' through any medium except cash, and not draw the eye of authorities. And even if you did move it to cash, the majority of fraud in taxation systems is detected when quality of life/assumed assets do not meet the reported assets.

Assuming that a government is spending taxpayer money on a highly speculative asset that has a market cap of 1/10th the value of the amount of USD printed each month, why is that a concern? What is their motive?
Worst case scenario, they're still increasing the market cap, legitimising the currency, and (despite increasing their Bitcoin position), they would be pushing an agenda that removes their monopoly on money.

The problem here is that in the days following the Ghash debacle, everyone decided that "they didn't even care about ghash" and that "they knew it would solve itself".

Many of the websites that sell Steam games are very much part of a gray market. I spent a while buying a lot of my games through a certain distributor, and later found out that many of its cd keys were acquired by a combination of fraudulently placing credit card purchases and issuing chargebacks, and using regional pricing to acquire lots of keys cheaply, and then effectively selling you a Russian version of your game with 25% markup).

I personally advocate against the use of fiatleak, as it does not draw an accurate picture of Bitcoin's transactions. If I understand the system correctly, it seems to take any fiat for Bitcoin transaction, and record that transaction as a 'fiat leak'. If this is the case, all that it's showing is a blown up number. 
With MtGox's API being so transparent, many of the trades that occur on MtGox are bot scalps. Bots are constantly trading Bitcoin for fiat and back to Bitcoin. The result is that fiatleak.com does not show how Bitcoin is moving, and paints a very unrealistic picture of Bitcoin's demand.
Until fiatleak accounts for Bitcoin to fiat transactions, it's nothing more than pro-Bitcoin propaganda.

I don't like giving financial advice to people online, but you seem to just be struggling with some really basic math.
Call the price $1,000 just for the sake of simplicity. If you buy 1 BTC at $1,000 you have roughly 0.998 BTC after exchange fees. If you wait for that 0.998 BTC to appreciate 30%, you still have 0.998 BTC, but that 0.98 BTC is now trading at $1,300 each.
Now sell that BTC. $1,300 * 0.998 = $1297.40. Then subtract the exchange's 0.2% cut. $1294~.
Now imagine that you go to rebuy Bitcoin at the current price of $1,300. $1294/$1300 nets you 0.995 BTC before the exchange takes its 0.2% cut.
Assuming that the exchange fees were 0%, you wouldn't be making or losing any money. However, since exchanges do charge a very negligible fee, all that you'd achieve by doing this is donating money to the exchange.
EDIT: 
You may want to take a basic math course before you consider investing. A lot of this math is really simple multiplcation and division stuff.
This might help as a rough guide:
100 * 1 = 100. (The '1' here is basically substituted for 100%).
100 * 0.1 = 10 (The '0.1' here is 10%)
100 * 0.01 = 1 
100 * 0.001 = 0.1
Hopefully this helps you out.

There would be no reason to assassinate Satoshi, as he relinquished the role of lead developer of Bitcoin, and had already made his mark on the world.
I find it more plausible that Satoshi is just using a different pseudonym. The figureheads of online communities are endlessly barraged, and it's incredibly taxing on your mental wellbeing. The lamest option is generally the reality.
EDIT: But if you're looking for drama... Maybe Satoshi was a government organisation? Maybe Satoshi is living it up on an island paradise? The level of elegance in Bitcoin suggests at least one person with a Ph.D. in cryptography. Since sources suggest that Bitcoin is Japanese, that gives you a pretty good lead to uncovering their real identity of Satoshi... Also, what makes you think that Satoshi is a guy? Maybe *she* was assassinated.

0.0001BTC transaction fees nominally receive one confirmation per block. As far as confirms for micro-transactions, in most cases it would not be worth waiting for a confirm. I think a lot of companies like Bitpay will release payment with zero confirms. 
For a long time, Bitcoin QT's default transaction fee was, I believe, 0.005 or 0.0005 BTC, which is obviously unacceptable at the current exchange rate.

From what I can tell, primarily dishonest people issue chargebacks. It's not the done thing. I know a videogames company went bankrupt because for every 10 legitimate sales, 1 person would issue a chargeback, and the fees associated with the chargeback caused them to go into debt.

The best way to get them to accept Bitcoin is to explain to them that it protects them against chargebacks, and that the fees are quite low. Also explain that they never need to touch Bitcoins -- they can use an intermediary service like Bitpay or (I think) Coinbase.
However you'll need to come up with a case by case argument (based on organisational needs) for how they will deal with implementing Bitcoin payments into their POS, how they will train staff to use that new POS, etc.
Even then though, they'll rightly assume that only a very small fraction of their customers will be wanting to pay with Bitcoin. I've yet to come up with a reliably persuasive argument for that one. Most everyone who accepts Bitcoin tends to 'believe' in Bitcoin.

You can't just tell a person they're wrong without providing any evidence. By saying I am wrong, and not providing any evidence, you're providing me with the burden of proof. At least have the decency to tell me why you think I'm wrong.
In any case, I have plenty of proof for my rationale. Language exists. Language is a human construct. Motivation exists. Motivation is a human construct. See where I am going with this? Value exists. Value is a human construct.
As for intrinsic value -- some things are more valuable than others because they have unique utility. Silver has utility which gives it intrinsic value as far as its conductivity, and also because it is can easily be polished into a reflective state.
Though there's probably no point in arguing my case. You're probably yet another arrogant libertarian that's entire being is founded on irrational beliefs that contradict the norm in a desperate attempt to feel wise.

You're describing a process known as 'arbitrage'. You may want to look into it.
There are certainly people making money from arbitrage and Bitcoin, but they are mostly people who have a very solid understanding of the pros and cons of each exchange.
At the moment MtGox clearly trades at a higher price than all other exchanges, but getting money out of MtGox is very difficult. I would not personally risk trying to sell my Bitcoin at MtGox so that I could move that money and rebuy at a lower price. With Bitcoin rising by &gt;5000% last year, it would be a big risk to lock your money up for the 3 months it would take for MtGox to get it to you.

I think there are shitloads of reasons why Bitcoin is advantageous to consumers, but I've listed them all before, so I'm going to play devil's advocate instead. 
1) This isn't really an advantage against having a credit card or a paypal account. If anything, Bitcoin is probably less user friendly than other methods of payment.
2) With a credit card, if someone tries to scam me, I can reverse the transaction by issuing a chargeback with my bank. I don't have that insurance with Bitcoin. If you get scammed out of Bitcoin, you'll never see that money again.
3) It is not an appreciating asset, it is a deflationary asset. The two are interlinked, but not intrinsically. The price of Bitcoin is solely correlated with what people are willing to pay for it. 
4) It's definitely capable of moving borders more easily, but for remittance from USD to AUD for example, requires a USD -&gt; Bitcoin transaction (costs money in exchange fees), then Bitcoin -&gt; AUD (costs money in exchange fees) plus taxes and fees on each side of the transfer as well. You may also get into a nightmare as far as capital gains taxes.

I think you might be looking into this a little much. Bitcoin simply makes sense, at least to Zynga's business model. The bulk of each microtransaction is lost in fees. Ultimately, Bitcoin is just incredibly relevant to the games industry.
I anticipate that a lot of indie game studios are going to start using Bitcoin, especially because of its irreversibility. There were a few studios that were going bust when they were trying to sell their games, because of people even worse than pirates who were issuing chargebacks to get a free 'legit' game.

This is a really terrible algorithm -- many of these should not be nested. Also, you never define BITCOIN_SUCCESS or BITCOIN_FAILURE as either true or false.
I feel that many of these could also be more easily summarised with an or condition... For example:
if (outlawed OR !convenient OR !safe OR etc) {
 return false;
Also, where are you pulling a probability of .5 out of? Not only is that value completely arbitrary, but it's also static across seemingly unique conditionals. 
EDIT: You obviously wouldn't want to use an entire list of OR checks though. That would make it inefficient. You would probably want to group them by some form of priority hierarchy. 
There's still no reason for any of this to be nested though. The more you nest, the less efficient your code is.
if (outlawed) {return false;}
if (hacked) {return false;}
if (fatal_flaw) {return false;}

The issue is that America is the default on the subreddit. I am Australian, and every time I make a post that relates to Australian legislation, I say as much. Every time someone makes a post relating to China, they say as much. It seems only fitting that instead of American law being "THE law", it is simply "American law". The fact is that the majority of Reddit's community are not from the USA.

r/Bitcoin is a subreddit that's dominant narrative is pro Bitcoin. Many people here are bullish on Bitcoin, with longer term estimates between $100,000 and $10,000 per Bitcoin. This is not the place to ask questions about 'whether it is worth investing', because the dominant answer will be 'yes'.
Ultimately, you should never take financial advice from strangers. What you should consider though, is reading up about Bitcoin and coming to an independent conclusion. I think you'll probably find that Bitcoin is an incredibly novel, highly innovative technology that has the potential to change the way that we interact with money.

I really hated Bitcoin at first. While I don't have a problem with marijuana, I have serious ethical issues with heavier drug substances, coming from a community that had a serious drug problem and having had drug related sexual violence in my family history. A large part of Bitcoin's narrative at the time I heard about Bitcoin was Silkroad.
I thought you were all a bunch of junkies, and dismissed Bitcoin as junkie money. I'm an academic, and generally get pretty mad at myself when I realise I'm dismissing a concept without looking into it properly though. This lead me to r/Bitcoin, and I started looking into things more and more. The more I read, the more I was convinced, but there was always this lingering doubt. 
Eventually it all rushed to me, and I was convinced all at once. Bitcoin's blockchain has solved the important issue of making me trust people when I should have an active reason not to trust them. The implications of that are so profound, that I was convinced.
Though separately, I also had an "ah ha" moment when my dad wanted to start trying to sell the opal that he mines online. He looked at Paypal's fees, and basically just dismissed the idea from then on, saying that he couldn't afford it. There's just too many middle men all wanting a cut. I'm yet to convince him to accept Bitcoin, but one day he'll hopefully have the same "ah ha" moments that I've had.

Okay, let's say that you buy 1 BTC for $800. That BTC then loses $50 value. The value of that 1 BTC is now $750. If you try to buy something with a converted value of $800 with your Bitcoin, you will not have sufficient funds to pay for that item. This is how all between-currency transactions work.

 &gt; Who the fuck are you and what is your basis for thinking bitcoin has no chance of going to $10k by 2016? 
Firstly, he didn't say that he doesn't think Bitcoin will be $10k by 2016. His statement suggests that it will not be $100k by 2016. The rest of his statement is basically just "put your money where your mouth is".
And as far as who he is to think that? Someone who isn't a fortune teller. No one *knows* what the price of Bitcoin will be in 2 days, much less 2 years. You on the other hand said that "10 BTC should be worth $100k", which is just complete and utter speculation. So instead of asking this guy 'who the fuck are you and what is your basis thinking Bitcoin has no chance of going to $10k by 2016', ask yourself who the fuck you are, and why anyone should give a shit that you think Bitcoin has a chance of going to $100k by 2016.

Visa and Mastercard are both different payment options that utilise the say technology. The parallel is not at all absurd. If anything, I find it more absurd to compare it to two companies, when Bitcoin and Litecoin are both public domain. At its heart, crypto-currencies and the blockchain facilitate payment, and Bitcoin vs. Litecoin are just two brands using the same technology. It's the technology that matters - not the arbitrary values that Satoshi picked.


Why? There is nothing here that is based in logic. This is a purely philosophical notion. And as far as a philosophical stance, yours is one that directly contradicts the open source nature of Bitcoin. Why did Bitcoin use proof-of-work? There are other peer reviewed hashcash derivatives that should be explored, and there are people willing to do it.


I think it's rather harsh to suggest that all altcoins have a "we're better" mentality when many altcoins are trying to compliment Bitcoin. Further, what is the 'very purpose of Bitcoin' in your mind? Nothing here clouds the idea of Bitcoin. The very purpose of Bitcoin was to offer a robust solution to double-spending, which Bitcoin has partially fulfilled. I do not see how alt coins can jeapordise that.
I recommend rethinking your view on altcoins. I think you may find that a lot of your abhorrence for them stems from philosophical reasoning rather than logical reasoning.

An interesting point about money is that it can stop being money. No one would treat an ancient Byzantium coin as money in our modern world - despite the value in its electrum.

You need to understand that a lot of people who are involved with Bitcoin are computer scientists specialising in information systems, cryptography and encryption. Any time you ever suggest that your Bitcoins are secure, someone will always one up you and say that their coins are soooo much more secure, or point out a flaw in your system.
Ultimately, I think it depends on how much value that you're storing in your blockchain.info wallet. Consider a real world wallet. Most people have lost a wallet at some point. Sometimes people hand that wallet in, but more often than not, the money in the wallet is gone forever. With the high rate of loss, most people don't tend to put more than a few hundred dollars in their wallet at a given time.
Now consider your blockchain.info account. As long as you remember your passcode and can 2FA, you can definitely get access to your Bitcoin whenever you want them. There's no risk oft them falling out of your pocket. Realistically, once you have 2FA enabled + passphrased, you're basically not a target for hackers, since there are accounts without 2FA that they could be targeting instead.
If you've got a house worth of Bitcoins sitting in your wallet though, you definitely don't want to lose that shit. Invest in an offline hardware solution.

Until the 1940s, credit cards didn't exist. Before the Nixon Shock in the 1970's, you could trade a US dollar for its gold equivalent. Until the late 1990's, you couldn't safely transfer money over the Internet. Until the late 2000's, your money was centralised.
The way that we use money updates and evolves over time. I think it's a little redundant to try to speculate on how agents in 100 years may utilise or exploit Bitcoin.

If you decided that each piece of paper in your notebook was $100 worth of Servicemaster Bux, do you think that anyone would accept that money? Probably not.
The thing that gives Bitcoin its value is its globally distributed network, its active developers, and most importantly, the people who are willing to accept it.
You seem to think that Bitcoin is a scam. You know what else sounds like a scam? The US dollar. If you deposit $10,000 into a bank, do you know what happens to that money? It gets loaned out to people. The bank doesn't have your $10,000 anymore. All that is in your account is numbers. The $10,000 leaves the bank, they input some numbers into a machine, and presto, now your account has $10,000 in it as well. The guy who loaned that $10,000 out also puts it into a bank. That money gets loaned out to people. Alakazam, another $10,000 exists. Your initial deposit of $10,000 is now being pushed to bank after bank after bank. Rinse and repeat until there are $85 billion USD being produced every day.

Litecoin is the leading alternate cryptocoin. Bitcoin's market capitalisation is somewhere in the realm of billions of dollars, while Litecoin's is roughly half a billion dollars.
Litecoin and Bitcoin share much of the same protocol, but there have been several changes, such as the number of coins that will be produced (Bitcoin will be 21 million, Litecoin will be 84 million). The most notable change to Litecoin is that it uses a different hashing algorithm, called Scrypt. An advantage of Scrypt is that it is more resistant to ASICs, as it requires memory in order to hash (Bitcoin ASICs don't have much memory).
EDIT: By the way, never feel stupid for asking a question. :)

I've done some LTC speculation, and here's why:
1) Some people have Visa in their wallet; other people have Mastercard. Hell, some people have both. There is room for multiple payment options that are built on the same technology to co-exist. This kind of relationship is healthy.
2) Network diversification. The majority of alt-coins have not managed this. So far, LTC is actually doing this really well, largely because of the ability for end-users to mine with GPU. This is one of the core strengths of LTC, and probably the real strength of scrypt.
3) LTC has more room to grow. From a speculative standpoint, its lack of adoption is appealing. There have been numerous suggestions that LTC may be adopted by both BTCChina and MtGox. I stand to see gains if this happens, whereas the buying power of my BTC would lower.
4) Trading crypto into crypto is nicer than trading crypto into fiat.
5) Psychology. LTC is limited to four times as many coins as Bitcoin. Humans are susceptible to number anchoring, and having more of something is nicer than having fewer of something.
6) Transparency. I know who Charles Lee is. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? How many coins does he have? Wait, is he a he? What are their motivations? Are they an individual or a group?
7) Block processing. The fact that blocks are processed much faster may have significant long term implications that have not yet been explored.
Edit: Downvote me all you want. Technology adapts and changes. Until a new currency has a $1 trillion market cap, you're a speculator as much as I am. The difference though, is that I'm not a zealot that spreads FUD in place of having appropriate discourse.

This is a process known as arbitrage. It's well known to everyone.
The reason not everyone is doing it, is because there are risks associated with doing so. Consider the amount of time it takes to get Bitcoins, turn those Bitcoins into fiat, get that fiat delivered to your bank, and then get that bank wire back into the exchange of your choice. This is a process that can take months, especially if you are dealing with MtGox.

I am not sure that the white paper is the right source for people who are new to Bitcoin. End users of a software should not need to understand how the gears are turning.
Instead, what these people should do is novel transactions with Bitcoin. Send your family in another country a Bitcoin. Watch how fast they get it. Give a colleague 0.01BTC just to show them how it works. You'll probably learn something as well. This is the kind of thing that a novice user needs to be learning.

Other posters seem to have your actual questions covered, but I feel like you may be skipping over a very important step. When investing, you need an investment strategy. My advice is that you shouldn't push all of your £5,000 in a single transaction. You should look into 'dollar cost averaging'. I recommend converting £1,000 into BTC on the first of the month for 5 months, or something similar. This helps mitigate the risk of price variability.
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:26:52
Of all the people that sold their Bitcoin, my guess is that almost none of them pulled their money from the exchanges - they were all just hoping to buy in at a cheaper price. As the price rises, they are going to lose their opportunity to buy back cheaper, and they'll buy back in for fear of losing coins on their trades.
Also, OkCoin started taking CNY deposits for LTC, so I am guessing that China's BTC exchanges will follow suit in the coming days/weeks.

I am worried about the price of a Bitcoin because I have a large amount of my capital invested in Bitcoin. I also see the price of Bitcoin as being a measure of success, since the demand for Bitcoin directly influences the price of Bitcoin.
I am worried about government acceptance because I cannot pay my taxes in Bitcoin. I'm also fairly convinced that merchants are not partial to breaking the law. If I can't purchase things from brick and mortar stores with Bitcoin, my magic Internet money has less utility.

The price of Bitcoin is directly correlated to the demand for Bitcoin. An increase of price means that Bitcoin is becoming more successful, while a decrease in price means that Bitcoin's demand is wavering, and that fewer people will be trading Bitcoin.

1: Merchants don't need to pay 1% fees to miners. They may pay that kind of fee if they choose to use a service like Bitpay, but that's still much cheaper than Paypal's 2.4%~. Many vendors are now offering discounts to people who pay with Bitcoin.
2: Confirms are just insurance against double spending. In virtually all cases a transaction with zero confirms is completely legitimate. I would only wait for 1 confirmation if I was dealing with $100+ and 6 confirmations if I was dealing with $10k+.
3: I don't think this situation is possible in practice. That said, the deflationary nature of Bitcoin is certainly a challenge that Bitcoin (currently) faces. Keep in mind that adoption is still incredibly low.
4: Accessibility is still a huge issue. Without taking an afternoon off, I couldn't explain Bitcoin to my family. I think this issue is going to be moot in the future. Again consider that this is still early days.

You're wrong. Currency does not require tangibility. The attributes of currency is that it must be a unit of account, portable, durable, divisible, and fungible. Money is those things, plus a store of value.
At a stretch, you could aruge that Bitcoin is not portable, because 'how can you carry a Bitcoin'? But then my counter would be that currency does not require physicality, it simply requires tokens of account. If anything, Bitcoin's strongest point is its portability, because you can transfer it from one side of the world to another in moments.

You seem to be experiencing an issue that a lot of novice speculators make. You are thinking in terms of raw dollar values, rather than logarithmic values. If you are treating Bitcoin/Litecoin as a speculative asset, you will need to work by the percentage of gains you hope to receive, rather than the raw dollar value.
Both Bitcoin and Litecoin represent a store of value, so saying that one or the other is "too expensive" is just silly. $1,000 USD worth of Litecoin is the same as $1,000 USD worth of Bitcoin in terms of their value store.
Before you invest your money, try to fully understand these concepts.

MtGox formerly traded the majority of Bitcoin, but has since had issues with liquidity. Because of this, you see an excess of USD on MtGox that can't exit the Bitcoin ecosystem, which raises the prices (skipping over a few steps in the process). 
A lot of people are silly and think they can arbitrage from cheaper Bitcoin sales websites to MtGox for massive profits, but the issue with this is the time that your money is in limbo. Most people aren't happy to have their money indefinitely on MtGox's servers, waiting for it to come back to them so that they can buy more Bitcoin at the cheaper point of sale, and repeat.

Your restaurant shouldn't just be a platform to advertise Bitcoin. While the sentiment of raising Bitcoin awareness is nice, there's no reason for you to be doing that at your own expense. 
By accepting Bitcoin, you will gain competitive advantage; it's just difficult to forsee exactly what that looks like, in both the short term, and the longer term. In the short term, I expect that the biggest impact would be that it would make your business a talking point. "Bitcoin accepted here" signs are still quite rare in the wild, and it may make your business a topic of discussion. "Did you hear that the restaurant down the street is accepting those Bitcoins?" The advertising potential alone is probably enough to justify the cost of training your staff.
If it helps; you're probably right that the volume of Bitcoin transactions that you deal with would be quite low. You'd probably be able to get away with only training manager(s) how to use the Bitcoin POS.

Bitcoin's speculative bubble is increasing public awareness of Bitcoin and creating a narrative that does not relate to drugs. Frankly, I'm pretty happy with the 'Bitcoin bubble'.
As far as Bitcoin reaching 'ridiculous fiat values' this is all just a matter of perspective. Take an hour and learn about the divisibility of Bitcoin. $100 worth of USD is the same store of value as $100 of Bitcoin, it's just a matter of how the currency units work.

Refuting someone's math is not the same as refuting the issue.
The efficiency of mining hardware is secondary to the hashing proficiency. Most miners would be happy to increase their power expenditure to increase their hashrate. This is evidenced by the CPU and GPU miners that overclock their hardware.

I am of the belief that there are parties with a vested interest in Bitcoin who are happy to spend Bitcoin's meager transaction fees to artificially inflate the volume of Bitcoin movement.
While I'm ranting, I'm going to reiterate an old rant about fiatleak. Lots of people look at fiatleak and swear by it. "Look how much money is moving into Bitcoin every day!". No. That's bullshit. What fiat leak shows is the number of scalps that are occurring in the MtGox marketplace. It doesn't show cash outflow which effectively reduces its utility to the point of being parallel to propaganda.
In a lot of ways, Bitcoin really needs to get its shit together. Unfortunately all the people developing for and around Bitcoin also have a vested interest in Bitcoin. There's very limited data in terms of critical numbers. 
Bitcoin is built around that idea 'vires in numeris'. It's ironic that there is no strength or substance to many of the numbers we quote on a daily basis.

Basic psychology: When people are making money they are more willing to spend it.
Also consider that every time someone buys a Bitcoin on the exchange, someone is also selling a Bitcoin. The fact that people are willing to sell Bitcoin should also imply that people are willing to spend Bitcoin.

There are many successful miners.
I've never mined Bitcoin, but I personally mined Litecoins for a long while, and amassed a number of them before they started taking off. I was just casually mining on a GPU that I already had. I eventually gave it up. Not because it stopped being profitable, but because it made my apartment way too damn hot.
One of the things most miners neglect to talk about is the intense heat that your mining setup will generate, especially if you're overclocking your hardware. It basically makes your desktop a small volcano.
@_date: 2013-12-24 10:25:50
I don't think any governments are going to outlaw mining on the premise of power consumption.

There are already a number of trading bots. Unless you decide to freely release the source, I doubt it will be of any use to anyone.
EDIT: Something you could probably make that I've not seen any of, is publicly available 'stop loss' functionality. I am sure that many people would be very interested in being able to set a value that makes the tool automatically sell their Bitcoin if the price reaches that value. This should be native functionality for all the exchanges, but I guess the people who make Bitcoin exchanges are the same people who have an active interest in keeping the price of Bitcoin high.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:45:59
I am not sure that i understand your question, but I will try my best at explaining it.
Every day approximately 144 blocks are mined, and (until the year 2140~)  those blocks contain Bitcoins. As the network's hashrate increases, the difficulty of finding a block is increased, to keep that average of 144 in place. 
Because of the ever increasing hashrate of the network, any hardware used in the process of mining (the minting of Bitcoins) will eventually become redundant as the total network hashrate increases over time. This effectively means that people who mine for Bitcoins are involved in a hardware arms race, where people buy specialised mining hardware with the intent of being more financially viable than other mining hardware (red queen hypothesis is at play).

This is a nice list of problems, but there are also lots more. The biggest obstacle for most people getting into Bitcoin is where to buy them from. A lot of people outside of the US get steered toward MtGox. It's somewhat daunting to the laymen that they are giving scans of their passport/utility bills/etc, to some random website.
Dig a little further, and you find out that the website they're giving these details to has been compromised in the past, in which the emails/passwords/account details of its clients were released. Dig a little further and you find out that they used to be a Magic The Gathering website.
Why am I giving these people all of my identifying information and my money again? These guys, didn't even buy a $10 domain name when they completely changed their business model...

As others have mentioned, the ship has sailed for GPU miners.
That said, nVidia cards are not as well equipped for mining as an AMD card. If you already have a graphics card, you could potentially put it to use by mining an altcoin like Litecoin. I would not recommend buying a graphics card with the intention of mining, though. And if you do decide to mine something like Litecoin, make sure you talk to your parents about this - mining will increase your power bill by a large amount.

The main issue as I understand it is training staff. The technical stuff is not that tricky to figure out.
Also, a vast minority of sales will be made with Bitcoin. At this point accepting Bitcoin in a brick and mortar store is more of a political statement rather than a way to attract a lot of new customers. That said, people with Bitcoin definitely favour people who let them spend Bitcoin.

1) I'm not comparing companies to technologies. I am comparing payment options to payment options. At the heart of it, any intrinsic value that BTC/LTC can claim to have is in their ability to serve as payment options.
2) Scrypt is kind of cool, but that's not what my point was. LTC has managed to meet a requisite level of network diversification that I am not seeing in many other alt coins. There have been other coins based on scrypt that have failed, but I feel it has worked to get LTC off the ground.
3) Litecoin has had more interest, speculatively. BTCChina has released a survey specifically asking its users if they want Litecoin, and magictux has famously posed with a Litecoin and heavily alluded to the introduction of Litecoin with MtGox's forthcoming trading engine.
5) I like the subtlety of Litecoin here in the short term.
6) Like it or not, this is on people's minds.
7) Randomly changing variables is what I do to improve lots of things. I'm a game developer, and it works wonders. :)
Edit: And as for "If you think there should be a new trashcoin for every feature we can come up with instead of improving Bitcoin, then why not buy PPC/NVC/XPM too then?"
I feel like I should come back to this. Yes. I do. The more people who are developing cryptocurrencies, the better. Underlying BTC is a new technology with serious implications and humanity as a whole should be trying to see what we can do with this to make money as liquid, fair and useful as possible. While I respect and admire the technical innovations of BTC, I also see very real merit in lone developers trying to make interesting innovations. The technology of BTC is amazing, but at its core, it's a technology. Technology evolves.

Something that seems constant among the posts against me is that there is this ever-present rhetoric about an omnipresent government that is trying to commit acts of violence against them. America is either way more fucked up than I thought, or you guys need a reality check.
As far as drugs in America, I am mostly cool with most drugs, but I think that some things should still be regulated (this word does not mean that I want you to get shot). I find it very perplexing that there are genuinely people who believe that nothing should be regulated. It's basically a level of crazy that doesn't account for malicious entities. It's almost like a form of market theism. 
Here in Australia, I can happily walk down the street at night and not be concerned about being shot. It would be irrational for me to even consider that anyone on the street has a gun. Gun legislation has given me this peace of mind and security.
Surely you guys also draw a line somewhere, right? Where does it stop? Should we not regulate having safety fences around pools, even though they protect children from drowning? What about the sale of plutonium? Are you guys happy for me to buy plutonium. "I promise I'm not going to use it to harm others. It's for personal use." What about land mines?

The reality is that we're barely on their radar. Bitcoin's market cap assumes each coin can sell at the top, which is simply not possible in reality. It's just a moving ceiling. The Bitcoin economy is worth far less than it's made out to be. Even so, a few billion dollars is pennies in a jar to the financial sector.
It's counter-intuitive to 'create demand' for the US dollar by willfully lowering demand for it. You also need to consider that every time someone buys a Bitcoin for USD, someone is also demanding USD with their Bitcoin.
The US government could certainly do a lot of damage to Bitcoin if it wanted to, especially by dumping the infamous Silkroad hoard. At this point I think there is a lot of positivism in the US at a government level. They seem to be open to the idea that it may be as innovative as the Internet, and that stifling that innovation is against the economy's interests. I don't think they perceive it as a threat to the US dollar, so much as seeing Bitcoin as something that can happily co-exist with the USD. Also consider that the Bitcoin protocol is increasingly moving in the direction of being a tool for remittance. 
Until banks start taking Bitcoin seriously and offering senators 'campaign funds,' I think Bitcoin is safe in the US.
