1) You (beter:only you) hold your private keys. Otherwise the coins in this wallet are not your bitcoins.

What do you think is a fair fee for such a service? We have analyzed the competition, which showed a lot of services with 1-3% fee, some even up to 5% when osing a randomized fee. There are also donation based services, but this is really questionable. A service like this also has service and marketing costs, which must somehow be covered.

It is widely assumed that big investors will only go into bitcoin when it is available as a financial product / on the stock market.
I hope in the future it becomes so normal to handle BTC, that those investors prefer to buy real BTC instead of paper-btc. Not having to trust anyone who pretends to store your assets is the key to crypto!

Hi Aggressive\_Dance, we're very sorry to hear you've had trouble with our service. Our mixer encountered a short-term technical glitch on April 3rd, which led to some unexpectedly delayed payouts. However, we were eventually able to fix the issue and make sure all of our customers  got their mixed funds. Based on the date of your post, we believe its possible that your mix may have been effected by this glitch. If you haven't already, we encourage you to check your receiving wallet again. If you still haven't received your funds, please send another support ticket with your session ID and we'll make sure you get your funds. Thanks for using Bitcoin Laundry and we apologize again for the mix-up.
