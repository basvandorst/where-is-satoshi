Section 5.1
"Deploy anti-virus software on all systems affected by malicious software (particularly personal
computers and servers)."
No particular AV suite mentioned but it is a requirement.
If in 15 years a single virus that made its way onto a production system was detected and stopped, AV is worthwhile.
AV is one of MANY MANY MANY tools you use to help prevent incidents, you install and manage as many security devices as possible.
AV may not be as effective as other security devices, but its still a valid defence system, witch is why its still in the ASD top 35 mitigation strategies

Number 6 can be automated. I've seen vendors offer email sandboxing.
This list is made by the Australian version of the NSA. So its target is always intended to be people who have high requirements for security.

Maybe they should have a mirror on the other side of the world. You know, to redirect sunlight to the solar panels so its never dark.

I said zero ongoing costs, unless you grow your own fuel, then you could totally do that

No, the past GHash, the joke is that this exact 51% problem has almost happened with BTC Guild about 2(?) years ago.

But you cant not play, not with the huge reliance on technology and the huge threats from hackers. The illegal hacking market is worth more than the illegal drug trade. Its only going to get worse form here.
I wont disagree with you that AV can be a pain in the ass, only that it does one particular thing that minimizes risk in its area. But its only one piece of the IT security pie. it needs to be combined with other good security devices, a good list of the basics is the ASD top 35 mitigation strategies.

What you have just described is called Application white-listing.
However if you keep up to date with the latest security patches you would know that there are at least 1 security patches for MS office and internet explorer that allow for remote code execution.
If you sent a word document resume to the HR department in relation to a legitimately listed job, they WILL open it and have a look, and now you have an infection, application white-listing wont help you here. What would help you here is something like Antivirus Sandboxing on email attachments, or just regular old host based AV.
Security is hard work, it involves many many systems of defense. Not installing AV isn't justified because you are choosing not to deploy a security defense tool that can stop the really stupid shit from infecting your workstations.
I will take your comments seriously when you go to your CIO and explain that you wont install AV because its redundant.

Bank servers do have AV, as required in PCI DSS section 5 (at least with computers within the credit card scope).
They also have "advanced custom firewalls and stuff" although what you are probably talking about is really just IDS/IPS devices (although the trendy word is NGFW) and just good firewall rules in a DMZ. HIDS also are very common.
You install as many security devices as you can to get what you call "defense in depth". Its part of a good security posture and it indeed does catch stuff, but that's not the point, you are reducing your risk profile.
When protecting entire companies, you are in the game of reducing risk, and AV does that, along with a bunch of other systems.
You can claim the same kind of "cause more problems than they solve" about firewalls, IPS's, HIDS, log collection, lest privilege user accounts, ect... However combined they equate to a much lower risk profile than any one of them alone.

Not really, av will always exist, you can't justify not installing av on a production bank server. Av does its job, and often well, it just doesn't cover all the bases.
Its one of many tools used to help protect a computer, its existence is still Important.
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:36:44
AV is a requirement under PSI DSS and Iso 27001. They run av on production servers relating to credit cards and banks.

You are not wrong but if bitcoin crypto was cracked, bitcoin would be the last of the worlds problem.
The whole world already relies on crypto systems like bitcoin immensely.
The growth of computer power poses no risk to brute forcing bitcoin, and the mathematics supports this.
@_date: 2015-05-27 11:59:28
I encourage you to read up on cryptography to gain a further understanding.
You are not wrong but there is a lot more to this all than saying it could be broken.
RSA for example relies on the belief it is very difficult to factorize ultra large numbers. For it to be broken we must solve that hurdle and we have not made any real process outside of quantum computers using traditional mathmatics.

I wont make a comment on the potential downtime, but i will on the PCI DSS compliance.
To achieve PCI DSS you must pass an independent certification by a Qualified Security Assessor.
They will absolutely tell you the following "anything within the PCI DSS scope is vulnerable". Now this means any servers within the DMZ, any jump servers, and any computers that maintain or manage any services of servers within the scope.
Database and web servers and the like fall into that scope and require evidence of AV installed and operational in order to pass compliance.
Because even with 2 hours of downtime a year, its still better than having a security incident resulting in the exposure of thousands of credit cards.

If you spent some time researching these you would know that they didn't really break the protocol they were a flaw inside of. There are protocol flaws, but very rare.
These flaws have been know for almost as long too. But its very very rare protocols gave fundamental flaws
While flaws may exist I'm bitcoin clients, there is very low likelihood it will impact the integrity of the block chain.
You can't just say a bunch of public vulnerabilities without understanding what they are at the core.

So bitcoin is in fact working! unlike the pm spam that claim otherwise.

Not until university of new South Wales, the closest known academic party to true quantom computers crack the technology within the next few years.
Until then you are at more risk of forgetting your password than anything else.

Always be on the lookout for patches! There are critical bugs practically every month.
Most security issues can be avoided or the impact reduced from a combination of the following:
* patching OS
* Patching applications
* application white listing (aka don't install random crap)
* least priveledge (don't give Bob from sales domain admin)
You can address this vulnerability either by application white listing (as this vulnerability requires local code execution ) or by patching.

Only on matters of "national security™"
There has been a huge paranoia among our government over immigrants and terror attacks that has largely enabled some pretty far reaching powers for the government and defense/security.
If it ever shows results it would be nice, but until then we still have some transparency problems.

Crysis averted! Malicious parties are unwilling to do work because as everyone knows cyberfraud isn't a billion dollar industry.
It's good to know I'm 100% safe because phishing scams are only built by lazy people.

This is plain false.
What happens when the fishing site asks for your 2 factor password and a user enters it too...
Sure the 2factor auth time is limited, but how long do you need?
