No clear 'killer app' yet.

How do I ensure my paper wallet has enough battery power and bandwidth for proper security?

This is the proper response to suggestions of using pgp WoT.

If people don't know that it's lost, does it really add value?

Or 7. The software, security, and governance somehow work out yet still aren't enough to out compete the competition. There's a typing point where 85% of hodlers abandon ship in a short time scale.

Dissembled for speaking an obvious truth. Oh well, I guess it's more fun to hate on ethereum.

That's a funny analogy: the postal system is as alive as ever. I predict we'll see a similar development with a very long fat tail of use of fiat.

That's crazy talk. What would all the cops do? They'd get so bored.

The first case restricted the rule set, so that any node which accepted blocks with a larger size would continue running with no code upgrades and they would correctly verify blocks with a smaller size. This is a 'soft fork'.
The second case loosens the rule set, so nodes which accepted small blocks and have not changed their code would reject new larger blocks which don't follow the rule restrictions in their code. This is called a 'hard fork'.

This sounds exactly like the Brave browser.

I'm with you. I don't care what workarounds exist. Why should I jump through hoops to view a link? Paywalls are the fucking bane of the web.

Have fun with that standard of evidence for determining anonymity.

Why doesn't the attack in the third video work without a two way peg?
Can't the half-commit protocol work when the attack chain is aware of bitcoin, but not the other way around? Bitcoin miners can do merge mining of the attack chain and initiate the plausible deniability phase of the attack.
So how can this be prevented?

You haven't had enough moonjuice if you're still hung up on valid arguments.

One example difference between counterparty evm and ethereum is that bitcoin miners don't see or validate counterparty contracts, so to verify contract state is a client must be a bitcoin full node. By contrast an spv ethereum client can receive proofs of contract state.
An example of this might be a DNS resolver for a name mapping contract. If it used ethereum spv protocol the memory, CPU, and bandwidth requirements would be much lighter than the counterparty equivalent.
A sidechain should be able to provide the same spv advantages, iiuc.
Edit: fixed some swypos

Perhaps the ratio of BTC stored at gox to all btc at the time was much much larger than the ratio of dollars list in the subprime mortgage crisis to all dollars.

They must be part of the civilized conversation camp. We don't serve their kind here. Quick, get 'em!

Why? It seems to fulfill a very obvious need for some bitcoin holders. What am I missing?

So where and how did you buy food?
Instead of complaining about consumer products that are easy for people to understand and use, why not enlighten more people about your methods in order to help the 'full native btc' economy thrive.
My guess is that the methods are too cumbersome currently for wide adoption or else there's just a lack of education. If it's really only the latter, then the moon rocket is ready for launch. ;-)

You have a pair, too?!
Mine broke, but if they worked I'd pwn the stock market. If you send me btc now to purchase a new flux capacitor for my magic future glasses, I'll wire you 10% of the BTC I'll make on the stock market with my glasses!

I'm not familiar with those stats. Is there a graph of the comparison or other summary stats?

I guess poor db2 feels outmoded by all these newfangled blockchains.

Tried it. Turns out merging two polarized and censored forums isn't nearly as awesome as having the same people and effort contributing to a single forum in the absence of polarization.

What payment method and currency did you use to purchase your last meal?

We have nothing to compare against. Based on this chart alone, using the same lacking of rigor, can't we say 'see this chart shows the detriment of the Fed, because the growth over that time period is half of what it could have been.' ?
Or I could say 'look, this shows what happened since the creation of the automobile. See what the effect had been on the return on investments in the general economy?'
I don't know much about economics, so I wouldn't at all be surprised if there is other evidence, but this chart without context demonstrated nothing to me.
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:04:54
How can we tell that this graph shows some effect caused by the Fed?
