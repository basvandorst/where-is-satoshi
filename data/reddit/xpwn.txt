You know.... there's this thing called renewable energy
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:07:17
Use Segwit and you won't have to.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:56:49
Yeah give me both lol.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:45:21

*wallet*. smh
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:08
This. 
I'm paying taxes come tax season. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:30:55
Big if true.
There is a reason the clique does not want this adoption. They lose BIG. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:14:22
Your fault, your fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:37
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:30
I think the Bcash network crashed. When was the last block mined?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:10:39
Segwit adoption needs to go up before a block size increase can be considered. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:15:15
The incentive is that they pay lower fees. They must use Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:31:40
The FUD
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:16:12
I lost $100 worth of BTC from the NiceHash thing. But you, wow my deepest condolences.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:03:24
Nobody is using it on a large enough scale. Segwit works.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:16:23
Because it can virtually clear the mempool, but people have to *use* and *implement* it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:14:45
You pay your credit card bill once a month right?
But you make many transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:51:57
I like Slush's.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:51
Use Segwit
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:04:53
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:33
ahhh gotcha! This had me confused: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:12:30
BTC- Bitcoin
BCH- B*tchCoin
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:53:11
This is a joke from a top post with a twist.
If you don't get the reference it is okay!

Mark is such a sleazy character, always screws everyone.

If You Type Titles like This then I do Not Take You Serious

All of the TX's are Businesses and Clients.
Instead of Me&gt;Best Buy&gt; BB's Suplier&gt;paychecks&gt;etc&gt;etc.
It is just one Tx. Me pays whoever gets the $. in the end
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:42
Trezor. I got it for $68~ish on Amazon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:06:55
Think of all the ATM's pulling 75w each.
Think of all the bank employees driving to work each morning
Think of all the money transport trucks driving around weighing 10 tons 
Think of all the banking infrastructure. It's big, and you don't notice it.
Everyone has a smartphone with internet, that is all you need for BTC. The miners? Eh. Renewables. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:23:30
They are all colluding. It's a small powerful clique. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:28
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:46:55
I want a pension.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:56:15
I agree
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:38
Withdraw through GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:28:31
They have showed their true cards. 
They picked the worst time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:31
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:21:37
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:49:32
Maybe I'll hit that problem too knowing my luck. 92%! I'll update.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:22:09
Why does the chart start at 5k?
Fake news

If you can successfully launch this..

Bitcoin is the original chain, so if anyone forks a new currency off it, you have coins on that chain too.
Let us say you had BTC before Aug 1st, you'd have BCH too in the equivalent amount.
One day BTC will come out of its' cocoon and fix itself. This will send the value of BCH plummeting. 
BTC is for safekeeping. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:27
Maybe $200 max/month
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:37
All of the weak hands are letting go. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:03:08
I really want a PS4 pro now!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:30:10
You bet. I agree.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:34:51
Those Bitcoin ATM's are so bad.
Thank you for sharing. Others have had very similar experiences.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:55:21
No it is Litecoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:06:00
Correct. Someone did an analysis on here a few days ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:38
Or, Chase. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:24:28
Just moved 90% of my coins to GDAX then withdrew to my personal wallet.
Now if the transaction can confirm, that'd be great. 
Sketchy company.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:39
You are not the media and that is certainly not a headline
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:21:56
Yes. You speed you pay the ticket. You don't use segwit you pay.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:14
Bitcoin has turned on the afterburners. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:54
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:41:38
We are talking about bitcoins not dollars
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:09
Exponential growth! To the moon. Some big players on the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:23
Time is everything. Everyone scolded me for buying with mastercard/visa.
Try buying BTC directly from the bank, locks in the price.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:02
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:39:02
Find those 12 words and you're rich.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:29:24
I think the 12 word phrase is the seed. I'm no expert
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:49:57
Crazy trade volume.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:37:37
No. Wait until tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:05:44
Heck Yea!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:50:48
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:50:28
You'd do that over time. Taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:32:57
You could do really well on Nicehash. There is a sub-reddit for them.
You'd mine alt-coins (selling hash power) in exchange for BTC. I'm going to guess you'd get a payout once ever 3-4 weeks. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:30:29
But not its' largest percentage drop.
Today was a big drop but there have been worse. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:29:33
I think "its'''''''" been a long day for us all
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:07:24
Dow plunges more than 1,100, largest single-day point drop in history -ABC News.
Biggest point drop. Not percentage.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:43:31
You know I will be, interesting times ahead.
