This is exactly the kind of post that makes people think this sub is a cult. You think it is inevitable that an essentially irrelevant (at the moment) crypto currency will be the main reserve currency within 15 years. And you are upvoted. Hell there are several thousand individuals in the world who could sink Bitcoin tomorrow on a whim.
Even if Bitcoin is amazing plenty of good ideas have gained far greater traction in the past and still failed. Even if some cryptocurrency is the dominant currency in 15 years it probably will not be Bitcoin.

I spent the first two years of my career working for a single firm that keeps enough cash on hand to choke bitcoin for years. That's one company. You really think they're attacking you in any meaningful way?

Nice buzzwords.

So you would say a group of people with vested interests can't be logical. Would you say that extends to r/Bitcoin as well?

And people wonder why most people think Bitcoin is a joke?

It's actually really easy to make diversified portfolios. Just take a short position in a strongly correlated portfolio to your holdings. The classical issue is that you want to make the least volatile portfolio of a given return. Bitcoin isn't going to help with that

"Would have a much higher market cap".
So because there are some big oil companies and some small oil companies their values have nothing to do with oil itself?
Haha
