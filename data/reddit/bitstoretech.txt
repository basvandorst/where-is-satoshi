There are e-commerce platforms that allow you to shop with crypto regardless where you are, and you are not tied to a certain exchange or a provider, but it's a good thing coinbase is waking up to the fact people want to use crypto daily.

Hi CanadianRegi,
Absolutely, if you would like to support the project and become one of our testers we can enable LTCT which you can use for test orders.

In few days we will complete our Discord support channel, with section for testers as well so stay tuned!
Finally i would like to point out that currently [bitstore.tech]( does not have a minimum order amount and our admin fees are substantially lowered to help all new customers to test the platform and help us to improve and fix all possible bugs.

Hi dmdeemer,
In a nutshell the process looks like this:
* If you want to spend crypto for shopping online, go to bitstore, download the app and choose an affiliated store from the store listing: [
* Choose your products on the vendor website, go to cart and click "checkout with bitstore" this will take you to [bitstore.tech]( to complete the order using chosen cryptocurrency. 
* We will accept payment in cryptocurrency, it will be converted to vendor chosen currency (currently we support vendors trading in GBP) and bitstore will connect to the vendor to order the items you want.
Depending on your location there are two options for item delivery:
* Regular order using vendor's shipping method - in this case item will be shipped to you directly from the vendor
* Bitstore custom order \- if chosen vendor does not deliver to your country, we will organize courier delivery with DPD / UPS / DHL for you, this way increasing number of online stores crypto-shoppers can interact with.
I hope this clears some of your questions, if you need more information please do not hesitate to contact us!

Hi deuteragenie,
As I've mentioned to rockingBit, currently bitstore.tech does not support vendors based outside UK. At the moment we work with vendors located in the UK and we deliver from UK to 36 countries listed here: [ 
List will be expanded in due course and more vendors will be added.

Dear rockingBit! We appreciate your interest in our project and services! We recently went live and currently bitstore.tech does not support [amazon.in]( \- because we work with vendors located in the UK region and we deliver from UK to the listed 36 countries currently supported (we plan to increase this number)
Still we are working towards the expansion of our services to other countries vendors and we will inform you when [Amazon.in]( is available. Meanwhile you can order items from [Amazon.co.uk]( and we will arrange delivery to your country if its in the currently supported countries list: [ 
If you want, you can register on our website to stay up to date with our news and announcements.
