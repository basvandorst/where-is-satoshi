The thing is, the problem you are stating isn't even that hard to solve.  The reality is that at the average of 144 blocks mined per day, a 5% pool offers the same effective return as a 40% pool, and even if the variance was high, there are ways to remedy that problem.
The fact of the matter is that the reason people trust Bitcoin is that it doesn't rely on powerful organizations promising not to abuse their power, and you just now are defending your position by making that same promise.
Build a technical solution that either splits your pool into smaller pools with decentralized control, or proves that it's not possible for your pool to participate in a coordinated attack.
I realize that these problems are baked into your current software and that they won't be solved in an instant, but you are right--it's not realistic to expect a company to selflessly decide not to grow.   Instead, as the company closest to that threshold, it's your responsibility to come up with a way to grow responsibly that doesn't threaten a decentralized protocol with centralization.

Do they really, though?  In a way that you as a miner can verify?
(I'm asking because I literally don't know the answer)
It seems to me that they just give your mining equipment an opaque block to sign, and once you do, it's up to them whether they do anything with it.  Could they be skimming some blocks off the top without telling anyone?
You have to keep in mind that internet services that are "free", the user *is* the product.  So if you're mining for 0 fees, who's buying that product and what are they doing with it?

If there are X bitcoins in existence, each day that goes by there are 'X bitcoin-days'.  Bitcoin days destroyed (an awful name in my opinion) represents the movement of bitcoins, weighted by how long since those bitcoins last moved.  So if you mine a block, wait a day, then transfer 1 BTC to another address, you just added 1 to the 'bitcoin-days destroyed'.  If you waited two days instead, it would count as 2.  If you waited 3 days and sent 5 BTC, it would be 15.
Then the next time that BTC is spent, it 'catches up' the BTC days destroyed for those BTC up to the present time.
If every bitcoin in existence were part of a transaction today, the total bitcoin days destroyed would be equal to the amount of BTC in every block ever mined times the length of time since that block was mined.
On the other hand, coins that sit in one place a long time are slowly accumulating bitcoin days which will be added to the 'BTC days destroyed' stat when/if they are finally spent.

If the "government debases the currency" as was suggested, then yes, it would outpace interest by a significant margin.
It's like you guys don't even read the thread, you just look for your favorite "gubmint is bad" buzzword and laser in on a rant about it.
The funny thing is that I mostly agree with the points effallyall (nice name, btw) was making, in isolation, but put together they don't make a coherent argument.  It's almost like there's not a big conspiracy running the system, but rather a bunch of self-interested agents fucking each other over at every opportunity.

What mjkeating says is true, but it's worse than that; most attacks rely on the pool ignoring blocks that have been successfully mined until the attack is complete.  Including some of the attacks that ghash.io has been accused of already!  If, during this time, some other mining pool mines that block, it'll become orphaned, and you don't get paid for orphaned blocks.
Being part of a larger pool evens out your profit, but doesn't raise it.  Over a large enough period of time (assuming honest pool owners), you'll get the same amount.  Dishonest pool owners hurt their own miners profits and other pools gain, but it could still be in the owner's benefit to do so, especially if they can avoid being caught.
All in all, it's my opinion that you're best served being in a small to medium sized pool.  A pool with only 5% of the hashrate will still mine over a block every day on average, and your share of those blocks are higher which makes up for less blocks being mined.  If your mining profits require more consistency than that I think you're probably betting dangerously.

I am not a tax lawyer, but from my understanding when you sold 'a few coins' you should be paying capital gains tax on the ones you sold.  The cost basis for the coins you are still holding is the same as it was--the price you paid for them including any trading fees from the exchange.

Since you didn't reply to penelope's comment, I'm just asking for confirmation: you do realize that the rate of block finding for your pool has almost nothing to do with your profits from that pool, right?
As long as the pool is big enough (or lucky enough) to find *some* blocks, your profit-per-time is the same.  Your profit-per-block-found is bigger the smaller your pool is!

They *could* all agree to ignore any blockchain that includes a transaction from that address; since they control 50+% of the mining power, their blockchain will soon outgrow any blockchain that includes those transactions and be 'the official ledger'.
If that strategy was public knowledge, it's hard to argue that the transactions 'looked like they went through'; it'd be irresponsible for clients to treat those coins as real and most clients would get some form of blacklist support pretty quickly.
Not that I think this is a good idea, but, it's definitely possible.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:26:32
Yes, and often the second spend is to another wallet you control, so it's like taking the money back.
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:10:11
Do you have any stats to back that up?  I've been trying to find some information about luck between different pools and none of the data I've found is new enough to include ghash.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:09:52
So between block 280521 and block 280567 (46 blocks), ghash mined 14 of them.  Given that they have ~41% of the hashrate (according to recent posts), that seems extremely *un*-lucky; they only won 30% of the blocks in that time period.
Number of blocks isn't the important factor; your payout = number of blocks mined by pool * (your hashrate / pool total hashrate).  That second factor goes up a *lot* in a smaller pool.
For example, in the past day [p2pool]( has averaged around 185GH/s and won 5 blocks; p2pool has only [1% of the total hashrate]( yet they mined 3.7% of the blocks in that period, so by comparison your payout there should be much higher if you'd been in that pool over the same time.
Given, a smaller pool will have more variance, but the total payout should average out over time.

Well, bitcoins are very good at enforcing a very particular kind of contract--if you have the private key for some coins, you own them.
If you want to avoid your money being seized by the feds, it's not that hard to do so.  Just keep your private key somewhere they don't have access.  But DPR's key was available to the feds, so according to the protocol, the feds own those coins.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:06:21
Actually, my numbers are bad; a pool with 5% of the hashrate will mine 6 blocks per day on average.  I was thinking one block per hour, not per 10 minutes.
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:39:16
Only three more confirmations and it's virtually impossible to reverse!
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:21:57
Transactions have multiple outputs; if any output is to the offending address, the miners that ignore that address will ignore that entire transaction.
@_date: 2014-01-18 02:40:16
In your example, you do not need 66%.  Think of it this way:
We both have a six-sided die.  You start with *any number* of points (blocks ahead on the blockchain).  We roll our dice repeatedly at a constant rate, but I'm slightly faster--I get to roll 51 times for every 49 times you roll.  Every time either of us rolls a 6, that person scores a point (mines a block on their chain).
I will eventually have more points than you, no matter how many points you started with.  You might even get further ahead at the start, if I'm unlucky, but in the long run, my blockchain is going to be longer than yours, which means that it's the authentic blockchain according to the protocol.
If you have more than 50+% of the hashing power, you can ignore any other chain's version of reality, because you will eventually have a longer chain than them.  You just ignore any chain you dislike, forking it to make your own reality.  You throw away Ta, and Tb, and Tc after it, and just mine from the "...." on your post onwards.

How does this make any sense at all?  Mining is random.  They don't get more blocks per hash than any other pool, and your share is basically based on blocks per hash.  All that mining more blocks is smooth out your income, at the risk of destroying the network (and your profits) if BTC loses confidence due to attacks which can only be carried out by large pools.
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:06:03
AFAIK a 51% attack wouldn't allow the creation of more bitcoins;  it just allows the attackers to double-spend the same bitcoins at more than one target.
Since every node is validating the blockchain, any long chain generated by the 51% that contains invalid transactions is still invalid--it's just that with 51% of the hash power, you can 'go back in time' and make certain transactions never happen (including the distribution of new bitcoins to other miners).
So if you gave someone 10 bitcoins for $4000, that user could wait for 6 or 10 or 100 confirmations before giving you the cash, but with 51% of the hash power you could 'undo' those confirmations and spend those same 10 bitcoins on another transaction (for example, to another wallet you control).  Once your new transaction has more confirmations (which it eventually will, since you control 51% of the hash power), it' becomes the 'official' transaction, and the first guy's 10 bitcoins are now lost.

But if they debase the currency there will be inflation, thus reducing the value of said debt-slaves debt, allowing them to more easily escape their servitude.
I think this plan hasn't been thought through.

The difference is that anyone can become a bitcoin miner, you just follow the protocol and you're in.  It's not so easy to become a bank (even a small one).

Meh, ETH is very young, doing something pretty complicated, and DAO is simultaneously their biggest customer and also has a lot of 'regulars' holding the bag.  If they don't fork they are going to lose a ton of trust too.  I think they'll survive the fork but learn that they don't want to do it again.

No, he's suggesting that you place [limit orders]( on an exchange, then adjust your orders next month if the first orders didn't fill (because the market didn't drop to those levels).

A year ago BTC was at ~$6500, so you could have had ~.115 BTC at that time.  So you should compare the results of your up-front mining contract payment with that result, not with a comparison to today's BTC price.
Other factors to consider:  
* risk/upside potential (how likely was it that the contract ends up not paying out?  how likely is it that you end up making more than .115?)  
* liquidity loss (sometimes having .115 BTC today is better than a potential .120 BTC tomorrow)  
* depending on what you think the behavior of the mining network is, it's possible that the contract causes you end up with more/less BTC based on the performance of BTC's price.  So perhaps you can argue the contract is a hedge against BTC's volatility.
For the last point you'd have to do some pretty serious analysis of BTC -- how many miners jump ship when the price is going up slowly vs how many pile on when it's rising quickly?  If BTC crashed how much more BTC would your hashpower generate, and vice versa if it mooned?
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:49:17
Yeah, it seems like the large spamming pool is just subsidizing all non-spamming pools, at the cost of low-txn-fee-paying users.  Of course it's profitable for the miners, if it forces txn fees up, but I don't see how it's possibly *more* profitable for the spamming miner than any free-loading non-spamming miner.  I hope someone can clarify the attack because this post is really not clear.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:36:11
This is true, if you could predict the future and you *knew* BTC was going to drop to 7k, you'd certainly sell at 20k.
But what if you believe BTC is worth more than 20k, and you've invested the amount you are willing to risk against that belief?  You know BTC has a history of volatility; it crashed a similar percentage in the past when it hit 1k.
There's no reason for this person to sell at 20k, nor for them to be upset about the drop to 7k.  It's simply an expected part of the rise to whatever the actual value is, and if they tried to time the market and go short at 20k, that would be an incorrect action according to this belief, as it could easily have risen in this time period instead.

The answer to this question always depends on "what kind of regulations" and "on who"?
Bitcoin is somewhat regulation-resistant; BTC-BTC transfers are traceable via the public ledger but not directly linked to a person.
It's similar in difficulty to cash in some ways.  The tech for ATMs to scan the serial numbers of all cash they take in and hand out, for example, could be deployed in probably a year or two, if it's not being done already.
Exchanges are somewhat centralized by their nature, and act as a big data store of account information.  That data, along with acts of transferring fiat and crypto, is an obvious target for regulators.
As says, this is likely to help acceptance in the mainstream, but I think, like cash, there will continue to be ways to skirt this regulation if you are inclined to do so.

75: Adds a new constant `DEFAULT_ADVERTISE_2X` usable elsewhere in the code, set to `true` / yes / 1.  
492: Adds documentation for a new configuration switch `-advertise2x`, describing what it does and its default value.  
1084/5: Implements the configuration switch `-advertise2x`, so that if the user specifies `-advertise2x=0` (or something like that, depending on the implementation of `GetBoolArg`), the variable `nLocalServices` no longer includes the flag `NODE_SEGWIT2X`.
What this actually does requires looking for where `nLocalServices` is used, but the documentation suggests it makes the node not advertise itself as a segwit2x node, allowing it to blend into the network as if it was a "regular" node.
