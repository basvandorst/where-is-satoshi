I'm here for the technology. That's why I hold ETH.

What does this mean in practice though? Can you send me $5 over LN? What are the concrete steps needed for two people to actually use it?

How many people run a local client and download the blockchain to use BTC? Most don't.
You just recommended I use Paypal if I want fast transaction times and low fees. BTC was *supposed* to be a decentralized and trustless alternative to things like Paypal. Not something to HODL and get rich quick. That was a side effect, not the goal.

But when there was 1/10 or 1/100 of the current hashing power, the network was still considered secure, right? I thought as long as one entity didn't control 51% of the hashing power, the network was safe?

Actually, would you mind explaining why a hard fork is bad? It seemed okay when BCH happened... BTC is still here. Why not let the best coin win?

ooo yeah you're right. [Looks like the tx cost for ETH is up to $0.40 for about 5 minutes wait time.]( While processing more transactions per day than Bitcoin.

Actually no. Bitcoin used to have low transaction fees. It didn't scale well and the community hasn't been able to come to a consensus on meaningful changes to address this.

So limiting global on-chain transactions per second to 4 is by design and won't change?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:21:01
Well, other large cap, many transaction coins aren't having this problem. Ethereum isn't having this problem. Litecoin isn't having this problem. BCH isn't having this problem. Bitcoin is the largest market cap, but a lot of other coins actually have *more* transactions because it's easier and faster.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:59:57
...And they have much higher transactions per second. You seem to be implying because someone else does something, it would be bad for Bitcoin to do it.
