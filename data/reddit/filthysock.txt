Long weekend, but a short year

In that case, you'll have a lot of inputs :(

I'm in the exact same boat as you, unable to move my btc from bread wallet. I'm just going to wait till the Xmas / new year break and see if traffic and fees drop around then.

No, have a look at the other posts, people are seeing huge fees no matter what they use. Also consider this: If you are emptying your bread wallet, you may have a lot of inputs in your transaction. Every time you sent or received funds it used a different address, so now your one transaction today could have many inputs, driving up the price.

Non starter here in Australia, the electricity costs are crazy.

I miss those $5k days :(

Depends, did you grab the address off the wallet each time or did you reuse the receiving address?

Hang on. $1.4m is enough for retirement for you but you dumped around $50,000 into Bitcoin? Not begrudging your gains but you got super lucky on an extremely risky move that I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless they truly had 50k to lose.

You're not down $5k until you sell.
