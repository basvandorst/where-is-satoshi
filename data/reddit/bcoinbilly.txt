Always nice to see big companies utilizing bitcoin. They even pay the employees bonuses in bitcoin.

I think this is a great idea on some level. May not have to be all the meetings. But certainly some serious open meetings would be great to see.

Meaning cryptocurrencies are designed to be more transparent. Ending many of the corruptions of the traditional banking systems that hoard the money for special interests etc etc and are very private to the public. If they do allow something made public it probably a lie anyway. 
For all the bad that is written about bitcoin there is more good. Whether it is families in Africa who are able to receive bitcoins on there phone from families all over the world, or people who are mining and trading bitcoins in order to earn income, or bitcoin only stores being set up to protest the monetary system that is already in place... 
It helps keep governements out of financial affairs. Big brother watches every credit card sale, every bank account , etc etc. 
You can mine bitcoins and remain totally anonymous which is cool. Governments would never know who you are. 
Its more like Bitcoins - (Do you trust YOURSELF with your money) or Traditional money (Do you trust the government in control of your money)
Me personally I trust myself more than I would the government. The governments are able to regulate who makes money, who gets to keep there money etc. Certain people never run into any issues with governments and their money so they will probably be the complainers and the worriers for allowing something like Bitcoin to take root where there is more equality and deregulation.

I could not agree more. You make some great points as to how much constructive criticism can help make the bitcoin community better and at the same time make people aware of potential, or present, pitfalls within the digital currency movement.

What about the friendships that have developed over the years between the CEO's, government officials, banks, media and other people in power that is not publicized? 
These days I am more concerned with those "hidden alliances" more-so than what is made public. I think this strategy has allowed them to run the world.

Such a great concept. 100% Crypto means this business knows what bitcoin really stands for. 
Did I just see the Legend of Zelda being offered? Oh man, I used to love that game LOL.

I disagree. You can point out potential scammers in almost any charities. Doesn't mean it will happen.

This looks to be a game-changer for the trading industry. A real win for the Chinese here with a lot of automatic functionality.

Being able to catch these criminals are a good thing. Its unfortunate that malicious criminals disrupt the core principles for the foundation of cryptocurrency. At least these safeguards will keep these people at bay.

Here is an article on bitcoin convertions with cash, credit cards, etc. I am not sure it touches on pre-paid, but if it acts like a regular credit card than you should be all set.

Does the federal reserve still hold this position?

Apple Pay is still not a bad idea. I think most people involved with utilizing alternative payment instruments can attest to this sentiment as many crooks are involved with cash and credit card systems.

Great Video thanks for sharing

I can see it foreseeable if they regulate it correctly.

Russia is rethinking this policy as they have turned over it's thoughts on banning bitcoin over to it's central bank, the bank of Russia.

Can bitcoin replace the Euro in the near future?

This is an outstanding idea. Hopefully this innovation will generate more jobs and even deeper innovations that we have yet to think of yet.

I think it has a lot to do with it. When your able to reach across seas and plan military campaigns that other countries have no say over, than the currency control is small potatoes compared to that. Because now your dealing with economic natural resources that are much more valuable than pieces of paper.
