Idk if this legit or not but I got nothing to lose so....
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:38:48
It's crazy, I didn't think we'd come this close to $4000 so soon.
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:27:56
Are you serious? lmao
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:17:38
Why does that matter though? What are they gonna do with my public address other than see my balance?
I don't really care if people see my balance tbh....

Price is at an all time high right now. 
It's best to usually buy on the dip, but a dip may also never come, so nobody knows. If you want, just buy now and hold it for a year.

Why did you put 246 Bitcoin in Siacoin? It's not a bad coin, but 246 bitcoin, wow.....
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:52:14
GPU friendly as in you'll make more money mining it.
Mine ETH or some other altcoin, and sell it for bitcoin.... you'll make more profit that way if you're using a GPU.

How do you send  a segwit transaction?

I don't think you understand how market cap works. lol
$330,000,000*21,000,000 is a TON of money.... 
 There's only around 80 trillion dollars available on Earth.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:59:51
It could still dip.... 
Just a couple weeks ago, BTC was at an ATH of $3000, and then it dipped to $1800.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:16:19
I want it,  &lt;3

Sounds good, this challenge has been really tough to solve because of all the combinations/possibilities to try to solve this.
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:40:46
If you're really paranoid, you could try to reset your PC, uninstall all software and start from scratch. Maybe even switch to Linux if you haven't already.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:21:15
How did you solve it?
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:02:03
I'm kinda getting it but I really don't understand if/why I should hash it with SHA-256...... I'm confused after that part. 
So far, I took the string and decoded it with ROT-47, then I took that string and decoded it with ROT-5. And then I XOR'd the result using CoinGate as the key, I got this:
Am I close to the result possibly or completely off-track?
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:35:31
have you tried doing a SHA-256 hash on it? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:15:01
Which wallet was this file for? Try importing it there.
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:14:35
Any idea what Challenge  could be about? I'm clueless, lol.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:47:15
Can we get some hints for Challenge  u/CoinGate
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:32:20
You shouldn't ever need to input your private keys online..... you can input them to your wallet while your computer is offline. 
Never paste your private key on any online website.

Any official/recommended lightweight BCC wallets yet? 
I'd prefer a lightweight BCC wallet in an electrum style, but I'm not sure if that'll be available on day 1.
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:52:39
Anyone else kinda skeptical about using their private keys with the BCC wallet? 
What if it's a phishing scam to steal your keys?
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:35:17
Which wallet are you using? u/cortexualized
Do you have the private keys for the wallet? Import the private keys into Electrum. 
Electrum is  a lightweight wallet so you won't have to wait days just to sync your wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:49:18
Hey, when are the solutions getting published?
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:22:53
A paper wallet is essentially your xpub and xpriv printed on a piece  paper, along with the QR code as well.
Sometimes it's only your xpub and a QR code.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:03:45
Isn't that risky? What if the software is malicious and steals your bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:01:02
I solved it.
I basically used the BIP39 wordlist and matched the words with the numbers.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:43:19
I got challenge  lol, I feel like a genius now. 
Edit: I just used the BIP39 wordlist and matched the words with the numbers and I got the 12 word seed.
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:22:18
Gimme your bitcoin and I'll hodl it for you, I promise to keep it safe ;)

u/CoinGate 
Hey, just curious, can you explain how Challenge  was solved? I still can't seem to figure out what it is. lol
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:48:38
Someone should try this and buy bitcoin with it..... I wonder if it works. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:43:47
Probably too complicated  for most people right now.... Maybe in the future when blockchain technology is more widely adopted.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:07:46
Yeah, I didn't understand challenge  at all..... i'm not very good with images. lol
I'm really curious how that one was solved. Hopefully someone delivers!
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:09:26
Thanks! I really enjoyed this challenge and I definitely look forward to participating in future challenges!


Definitely several easier ones. It gives more people an opportunity to win something. *And variety is always nice!* 
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:25:47
Man, figuring this out is hard. Can you at least tell us if it's an electrum seed?
Some seeds are only compatible with certain wallets, so I hope i'm not wasting my time with the wrong wallet. 
*For example:* MultiBit HD wallet seeds are incompatible with Electrum.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:58:25
So, when are those hints coming ;)
Challenge  is really complicated :(
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:36:11
Damn, 0.4 BTC is worth nearly $1000 now..... In 2013, it was extremely cheap.
Good luck finding the wallet! Try to see if you have any backups of it (if you ever backed up your wallet).
Just curious, how do you still remember the bitcoin address of your old wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:13:34
PM'd, I'm interested.
Here's some of my [reputation]( if you want.
