This is the only correct answer.  If you are at a table exchanging something, you want your transaction to be confirmed asap.  
Can't do that "oh probably in the next 3-6 blocks"

I think they were open to being audited:  they have proprietary code apparently, but if some trusted developer can review the code, that would help.
Although it doesn't really matter, because if you install these apps in the app stores, they'll just auto-update to random arbitrary code.... so really, you shouldn't have a significant amount of wealth on any of these.  Hodling should be on an offline wallet.  Paper or hardware.

Give me your transaction number.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:07:19
I'm doing gdax.  They'll also probably protect us against replay protection - if it becomes and issue. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:38:42
I'm guessing in 3-4 hours.  I'll be back then. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:40:35
Your transaction was completed, you are welcome. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:12:56
Does this make the bitcoin average transaction cost go up then?  Are they manipulating the transaction fee cost?
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:16:49
Seems like a logical solution.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:28:41
As I understand it, it lets you fit 1.7MB of transactions in a 1MB block, so almost twice as many transactions can be processed (if everybody uses it).
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:23:58
Probably selling X2 to Bitcoin - gonna watch the market.  
Remember bch went to almost 1000 so, I need to check the market.  
I am guessing people may pour money back into alts after, but I already have a good position, so I won't trade for an alt, but I may buy more into an alt next, instead of bitcoin, after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:19:47

@_date: 2017-11-15 04:19:31
I respect that,.
If you are doing a lot of trading, I recommend ETH, due to so many exchanges having ETH trading pairs.  If bitcoin cash becomes adopted more, that'll be nice I suppose.
Another issue, GDAX / Coinbase, doesn't suppose bitcoin cash yet, so most Americans have to buy bitcoin, to just exchange it for other altcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:46:07
But... you have to keep them on both.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:49:11
Well, they aren't guaranteeing a return.  
Considering last year's return on Bitcoin is higher than the return you'd get investing in Bitconnect, they are basically averaging the return to give you steady income and taking the difference as profit.  
If they are also trading, they are making more.  Plus the tokens they control makes more.
Pretty smart plan.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:56:31
Wow. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:49:00
I guess.  But typically banks won't give money for a new business, they want collateral, personal guarantees, etc.

@_date: 2017-11-07 01:05:09
What should technically happen is Bitcoin core would be worth 90% after the fork, and bitcoin 2x worth like  10% - or some variation. 
But prices just keep going up.  Perhaps both will crash this time.  Who knows.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:08:45
Lightning network.  
Try the Elcair Wallet on Android Google Play Store along with this website: 
This will allow off chain transactions which should solve some scaling issues. 
Edit: this is on the bitcoin testnet so they are using fake bitcoins to test how it works.

You keep a modest amount on a hot wallet to spend.
For HODL, you keep it in a paper wallet.
I have the public keys in a google spreadsheet so I can watch the balance.
You keep saying the hardware wallet is more secure and it is impracticable to hack.  I'm saying that there are MORE attack vectors.  Thus, between the two, paper wallet is more SECURE.

Go less by the "security" and "feelings" and just run the numbers.
Is it better to save 4% in mortgage interest, or gain xx% in crypto earnings.  
Without a doubt, even with volatility, you are losing out by paying off your mortgage.
A bank loan is the cheapest loan most people can get.  Credit cards can go 18% to 36% and people don't bat and eye.  
Most financial institutions borrow government money at low low rates then loan it / invest it out.  Why wouldn't you cash in on this free money? It costs you such a minimal amount.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:43:56

Leave your coin on coinbase til November 15th or so, I know it's less secure, but you'll get both coins at fork.  
Sell the shit coin, buy more Bitcoin, then transfer to ledger. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:01:52
They are the same.  Coinbase is more for "newbies" and gdax is more tuned for traders.  
Gdax has no fees if you are a maker, so that's nice.

@_date: 2018-07-13 03:48:07
They don't hold it.  Your bank just takes a while to get your money to them.

@_date: 2017-10-30 20:15:44
Just like Bitcoin gold, they said they wouldn't give it.  But as of the fork date, you'll get X2 .  So, in order the sell X2 fastest, storing on coinbase for a few days before may be smart.  Just take off after all your transactions are done. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:28:53

Why did he not use monero?

Good question, let me know when you figure out the 2nd for me.
Although why OP wants to break the law anyway is beyond my grasp.
But for me, as soon as murder is legal, I'm gonna have fun.

I don't mind paying taxes if I can murder.  I fail to see your logic.

You have 150,000 thousand dollars in your twenties with minimum wage? Holy fuck.

That doesn't make sense.   It's the rate at time of purchase.  Afterwards conversation rates will go up, or down.  Sometimes dramatically, as bitcoin will do. 
Now, donate to the good cause.  Don't try to weasle out of it.

I guess he is surprised now.  Time to eat his own dick.

That's why you write it on paper, keep it off a internet connected PC.  
A hardware wallet or "hot wallet" can be venerable if the hardware wallet has ever been connected to a PC. 
And no, a paper wallet requires you to only write your private key.  Thus the word... Paper.

I don't think anybody would actually take my comment serious.... But here we are.  I found somebody.

This is true.  But what happened is the segwit block went inside a segwit block, to make a segwit squared block.  
You really need to read more. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 05:06:08
Now you can. 
Post proof you donated, so we can be sure it works.

Didn't he predict TenX wouldn't be a security?  LOL.  Fucking recked.

Odd.  Maybe it is live regional, ie, beta status currently.

Incorrect.  Paper wallets are most secure.  Hardware wallets have many more vectors of attack.  
You are giving out DANGEROUS advice. 
Plus, which a hardware wallet, you are told to write down your seed, which is essentially the paper wallet anyway.

Not good enough.  I like to be aggressive.

what are watchtowers?  im 5.  
does it just watch for fraudulent transactions?

I believe the force close causes things to take like 140 blocks or something - since the other party isn't there to do anything.
So, if you do something shady, there is time for them to be like "hey, what the fuck you doing"
you can't open another channel until that one is closed.  just connect to a different node - it'll route to where it needs to go... but obviously, it'll take extra hops.

Thanks for the personal attack.
