what if you are just a currency holder? Like i Buy 10,000 worth of pesos and go to mexico and while i'm there peso goes up 50%, do i need to pay taxes on what I spend?  or say I hold the pesos for 5 years and then spend them after they went up 50% ( or change back to usd ).
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:30:34
that taxes apply to the 'gains'.  Other currencies don't have this kind of encumbrance.

Mining is FUN and profitable as long as you use \*WASTE\* heat to warm your home, or otherwise recycle it.  
Nicehash makes it super easy to get started.
I started with a 1080 Ti video card, it was fun and helped me understand how Nicehash worked etc.
I picked up a V9 with and a power supply on amazon for about $300 total.  This would not be profitable at all except that I was able to turn off a heater in the basement so the same electrical bill also produced free Bitcoin!
I feel that many of those that say Bitcoin mining is not profitable are trying to keep others from mining ( so that it is easier for them to make a profit ).
Soon I will try to heat a greenhouse with bitcoin miners!  Others have done this already with \*great\* success.

Using your computer to it's max does not cause any damage.  I too mine with my home pc, it is great fun!   I use the excess heat to keep my basement warm all winter long so the power consumption isn't even a cost factor!
What kind of pc do you have?  I got 1080 TI , amd 16 core threadripper ( 32 threads! ) and 64gb of ram! It still only makes about $1 a day but the advantage is, in 5 years that $1 is going to be $100 !

I like quadrigacx, prices are still high though.  Best option for me when buyin 350 to 2000 worth of btc.
[bitstamp.net]( is great overall but you need to use wire transfers so it's not very convenient or cheap unless you are doing largish transactions.  Best value for me when doing over $2000  worth of btc.

Capital gains are taxed less heavily than other income, saving about 50% in Canada.  Find a good accountant, that's what I did!
I was able to defer the tax burden by putting money into retirement savings also.  Which somewhat hurts because it feels like the stock market is about to tumble and I could not invest into Bitcoin with retirement savings.  Doing this satisfied the banks so I was able to get a loan.

using a trusted exchange is the most convenient way.  Still do it in smaller chunks though.  Start with 5k or so, and then 10k, and keep on going.
[Bitstamp.net]( is one of the most trustworthy exchanges around, highly recommend.
Any legitimate exchange is going to have to do KYC before they can send funds to your bank, so if your goal is to exchange Bitcoin for fiat you'll need to identify yourself.  
@_date: 2019-03-08 00:25:22

@_date: 2019-03-08 21:23:59
You are missing the point.
What lightning does is bring the feature set of the 'new coins' to Bitcoin.  This includes instant transactions and infinite scaling promised by Nano.
Your 4 steps are no easier than the steps i used, although I will admit that your first transaction would be able to happen much faster as no channels need to be opened.

What method of e-transfer do you use?  I am in Canada, we have "e-transfer" part of the interac network.  If you send a payment it can take anywhere from 45 mins to 3 days to be sent.

I feel the same way about swastika.  [  
The word swastika has been used in the Indian subcontinent and the middle east since 500 BC.\[17\] Its appearance in English dates to the 1870s, replacing gammadion from Greek γαμμάδιον.\[11\] It is alternatively spelled in contemporary texts as svastika,\[18\] and other spellings were occasionally used in the 19th and early 20th century, such as suastika.\[19\] It was derived from the Sanskrit term (Devanagari स्वस्तिक), which transliterates to svastika under the commonly used IAST transliteration system, but is pronounced closer to swastika when letters are used with their English values. The first use of the word swastika in a European text is found in 1871 with the publications of Heinrich Schliemann, who discovered more than 1,800 ancient samples of the swastika symbol and its variants while digging the Hisarlik mound near the Aegean Sea coast for the history of Troy. Schliemann linked his findings to the Sanskrit swastika.\[13\]\[20\]\[21\]

users not willing to understand the fundamentals aren't really going to help anyone. 
Lightning is the solution to fast transactions, and it works so very well.
I understand why you think fees and transaction times are so important, but they aren't. Remember even the NEXT BLOCK could take a few hours, so high fees are totally pointless, if you want to transact fast, plan ahead, open some Lightning channels.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:04:44
you can set any fee you want, there is no need to rush things 99% of the time, just set a feee of 1 sat/byte and let it do it's thing.
The only time you need it \*FAST\* is when trying to time the market.... in which case you're making money so a fee is worth it.

3. LIGHTNING changes the game and makes retail an option
4. world markets are going 'crazy' with trade wars and conflict etc, this makes the world stock market more volotile which in comparison makes bitcoin less volotile, also a good hedge against your local government and world markets.

Total BS alarm going off here.
0 conf is not to be trusted. If you trust the person you are dealing with, it is fine ( like in person at a store or restaurant ) but totally NOT fine for online transactions.
Trusting 0 conf is like trusting the weather man, sure it's right most the time.... but eventually you're going to get soaked. I don't care what chain it is on.
Also BCH is so incredibly unsecure exchanges require 30 OR MORE confirmations, so that's 5 hours if everything goes as planned. 
Again, Lightning solves all this and IS easy to use. Please learn more and try lightning for yourself.

this is a common thought.  The problem is if there IS an established pattern, say every Sunday the price drops.  Everyone will notice this pattern and wait to buy Sunday, and then Sunday the price starts to go up instead of down and Friday it goes up... or Sat.. or who knows.  Essentially no matter what pattern establishes the pattern will change quickly.

i grabbed an asic from amazon for $300 including the power supply, used it as a heater.  it is LOUD so be ready for that.  I use [nicehash.com]( as it makes it super easy to setup and use.  Replacing a heater means all bitcoin produced is profit.  I also got a remote power plug so i can turn it off and on as needed, can even set it to turn on when outside temp is - a certain temp, so that's kind of cool.  
It is fun to do, and I did make about $1,000 worth of btc over a year.  Lots of people will tell you it's unprofitable, and they are right if you don't use the waste heat for something productive.  For me I use it as a heater that "also" makes some bitcoin ( basically use the electricity twice ).

You cannot "PROVE" a stable coin is still stable.  There is a serious level of trust needed here.  The only exception I could see would be if someone pulled a stunt like "These 1,000 coins represent 1,000 oz of gold", and then you fire off that gold into the sun, essentially destroying it.

@_date: 2019-04-23 15:54:21
I always select the lowest fees possible ( some clients let me do 1 sat per block, others 3 ), a block can take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to generate based on luck, it doesn't make sense to pay more to make the transaction 'faster' unless i'm trying to time the market and sell 'just at the right time'... in which case I should have moved my coins into a market well before this point in time.
Fees/worry about fees is very over stated imho.

From what I gather it is more than just "not getting it".  Some, just don't have money they can risk, so even if it is great and they see that, they can't partake.  Some are scared because they see it go up fast and drop fast.  Very fast.  Some know that this would be a source of stress for them.  Some are scared because they hear in the mainstream news a lot of negativity, including "bitcoin is rat poison!".  Some hate crypto because they lost money on it, buying the highs, timing the market, buying into the hype etc.  Some just see it as the "currenecy for scammers", as this is what many scammers use!  Then some... get interested in Bitcoin, head on over to what looks like a legitimate btc site and see all kinds of negative info about it, why it's terrible, and why there is something \`better\`.  These are huge barriers to entry, the only direct solution is education, and the best place to start is with the currencies they are currently using.

This is a good starting point: [
Example: bitcoin-cli -regtest sendtoaddress $NEW\_ADDRESS 10.00

\-regtest puts you in a local test mode so you can't accidentally send valid btc.

Where are you trying to spend that you are required to be in the next block?
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:48:56
No way to be sure, this is what I do though:
take [
divide by 2000
multiply by 10 minutes
so about 5 hours.  of course this assumes that others don't keep paying higher fees to pump everyone else down. 
Even if you \*KNEW\* you would be in the \*NEXT\* block, you could still wait 2 hours.... sometimes it just takes a long time to find the next block, so paying more/extra seems like a bad idea.  It is very rare that sending a trx must be done 'very fast', and doing so without Lightning is inherently risky because there is no guarantee of how long the next block will take to find.

Why not support him?  It sounds like a reasonable plan, all the costs are upfront, it might take longer than he expects to make back his money, but he probably knows there is some risk already.
If something goes wrong he can always sell the equipment, he won't get 100% of his money back, but he won't lose 100% either.
If he makes youtube videos about his project he might be able to monetize the project itself, selling kits or tools etc to "make your own".

Strongly recommend signing up for a few exchanges as it takes a while to jump through all the hoops, [coinsquare.com]( and [bitstamp.net]( are pretty great.  [Bitstamp.net]( is the best of the best in my humble opinion.

IMHO, This is the best bet you can make, but the risk is high.  One of the first rules of investing is you sell when you \*WANT\* to not when you \*HAVE\* to.
It would be way safer/guaranteed to just find a side job or something though.  10 Months seems like sufficient time to MAKE and extra $5k with only a bit of elbow grease.  Then keep the side job another 10 months and invest that $5k into Bitcoin and go LONG ( years ).

I tried to tip a haircut with btc today, the lady was intersted ( not excited, but seemed interested, she didn't know what it was ).  However she could not remember her app store password.  I gave her a cash tip of course.  I'm not going to refuse to tip if they won't accept bitcoin.  It is likely I will be more generous with Bitcoin because of the fun factor.

I bought the coins the same day as the purchase.  I will have to pay cap gains at the end of the year but it is fine.  This is what I did.
$1,500 cash -&gt; quad -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; Send to wallet on phone.
Spend $112 worth of btc on groceries
I now have over $1410 left in btc value end of the day, and he has about $115 worth.
So at the end of the year, when I figure how much btc i withdrew vs how much I deposited I will pay cap gains on the difference.  If it's more complicated than tha I will let my accountant handle it.  I am using a seperate account and set of wallets specifically for spending in stores etc so it should be easy to sort out.

It really isn't.  I bought the bitcoins specifically to buy goods.  Same day!
Even though it was the same day, I made a net profit, since I bought the groceries btc has gone up so both the grocer and myself have benefited from the transaction being in Bitcoin !  Essentially after bank transfer fee, and trade fee on $1,500 and paying $112 for groceries I ended up with $1410+ dollars of btc left over. 
Plus buying something with Bitcoin feels great!  It's even greater than the difference between paying with credit vs paying with cash!

@_date: 2018-03-03 01:19:42
I don't think you understand what is happening.
First, bitstamp fees for withdraw have always been 0, they pay it.
Second, volume is not dropping, it is very high.  Trusting bloomberg is a big mistake in this case.  You need to look at the outputs, which have been steadilly going up.  The drop in volume is "batching" which means you fit more outputs into a single transaction.
You can also lok at trade volume:   you can see bitcoin is  in terms of trading volume ( weighted by usd ) and is transacting a lot!
So either in terms of trades, or trx, Bitcoin is doing a TONNE of trx daily !

Trying to time the market is a bad idea, and will end up eating at your brain.  The easy answer is to do dollar cost averaging, buy every pay day a set amount, and do this for a few years.  This way you buy when it is high and you buy 'more' when it is low.   This is one of the most common and successful investment strategies that reduces your risk and producing long term stability and gains.

Sorry for your loss, sounds like you have a good chance to recover though!  Some great suggestions here.
I know it is too late for you..... but it is wise to re-initialize your hardware key and re-input the keywords before you put a lot of value into them.  I got two and restored they key to my second one to validate i had a backup of the keywords.  Seems like a lot of work to protect my very small investment, but the hope is one day it will be worth having been protcted.
Validating backups is very important, as important as making a backup.

While HODLing:
1. do some BTC transactions,  create a wallet for your friend/spouse/mate/whatever and send them $5 or so of btc, get them to send you some back.  Get a good feel for it.  Try doing similar trx with your bank and see how much better it is!
2. take some play money out, say $10 and fund a lightning account and play around with some of the lightening enabled games and toys!  Lots to choose from: [

ATM is one option, expensive.
Shop around for other banks and/or Credit Unions!
It would help if you have other business to give them!

huge flaw in this document:
In 2008, through an online domain **Bitcoin.com**, the creator of Bitcoin released a white paper. In the paper, Satoshi outlines how the Bitcoin will work using computer networks. The purpose was to end third parties for the digital transactions.

We also don't need to throw away the heat we generate.... we could reuse it for other purposes!

I did it last year, will do it again this year! It's not a lot, but it helps secure the network AND earns me some spending money.

You can still make money with a 1050, especially if the waste heat is useful to you ( do you heat your house right now? ).  Don't expect a lot.  Equihash is the algo that should make the most for you. No idea why nicehash isn't working for you, try again and maybe provide some error message that you are getting?

not so important, it will still average out.  Some times I have my fixed amount plus the 1% back from my cc, or some extra funds i stuffed away by not stuffing my face etc.  As long as you are not wasting your time trying to predict the future, it's a good strategy.

This is normal for a blockchain.  Remember that a block can take anywhere from seconds to a couple of hours to generate and you can't guarantee you will be in the next block.

I've been planning to get an S9 but i'm not sure how to get 220, do you mind posting a pic of the power supply and cable? 
I use a v9 at home to heat the basement, it made me about $600 i would not have otherwise had for 0  cost.  Setting these up at home is a great idea!
Some are saying it's a bad idea, and I don't know why.  No matter how you generate heat it costs money, so might as well recoup those costs with Bitcoin !

They are taking themselves out.  I know increasing the block size seems like an easy solution, but try using an ADSL connection!  My Telco told me even at 6/1 i'm not first in line for faster internet, because many in rural areas have even worse internet than this!
If we are to have true global reach we need to keep the block size small until the internet is faster and more reliable for all.  In the mean time let's work on getting those trx's smaller and smaller!

introducing dramatic changes quickly is an extremely bad idea, ask any software engineer.  ( any engineer at all, really ).
The fact that any coins are implementing this without months and months of testing is pretty crazy.

They are covering the funds, how are they gaining anything?
Do you think 41 million is worth it for binance? they make that i a day of trading.
Why so much hate?

This is normal.  Your transaction is in the mempool.  Blocks can take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to confirm and there is no guarantee your transaction will be in the next block.  Keep on learning, you're in for a treat!

Dollar cost averaging implies you don't look at price, you don't try to guess what the market will do, you automatically buy on a set schedule, that is all.
And it works very well, highly recommend removing emotion and analysis from the equation.

PLAY with bitcoin. get the core wallet.   get wallets on your phone.  get a nicehash account.  Mine as much bitcoin as you can, send it to your wallet ( if you can mine enough ).  Get a few exchange accounts, transfer money into all of them in very small amounts, buy some btc, sell some, with draw some cash from all your accounts. Talk to others about bitcoin!
Also as mentioned by others, read/watch Antonopolous.
welcome aboard!

It is very hard to hodl long term.  But as you break down and sell some, and then learn to very much regret selling you get better at hodling.
