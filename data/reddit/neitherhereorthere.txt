Dogecoin: Mmmm, "Bitcorn" is tasty.

Like every liberal, you mostly want the same stuff as libertarians, but you don't know how to achieve it without violence. While you may not see how the coercive actions of government are inherently violent, that is the reality. Libertarians want to protect the voice of all people groups: rich, poor, black, white, and everything in between so long as they do not harm others.
A progressive tax system is inherently unjust. You force people with the threat of violence to pay more if they work harder. Where is the incentive to work?  This sort of system encourages people to forego their morals, pursue unattainable careers, and live recklessly.
A single-payer healthcare system is not financially sustainable: every individual should be able to determine what they want in regards to their own health based on what they can afford. There is no right to force physicians to work harder and harder for less and less.  Instead, let's allow physicians a streamlined way to deduct procedures done pro-bono from their taxes.
Public education, like healthcare decisions, should not be forced on a person. Most teaching occurs at home. A school will rarely be able to inspire a child in a home with crappy parents. And instead of expecting all children to pursue a 4-year college degree, why not help them determine exactly what they want to do with their lives by encouraging self-discovery, trade schools, etc.
Other libertarian viewpoints: complete freedom of religion, freedom to do whatever you want with your life as long as you don't hurt others, freedom to speak freely, freedom to have sex with whomever you want (gay, straight, whatever-- as long as it's consensual), etc. In the end, allow free markets to sort things out.

For retail transactions, assuming: 
* 1) a relatively low value item (i.e. 0.5 BTC or less)
* 2) a reliable internet connection
* 3) connection to multiple nodes, disabling incoming connections, and selecting specific outgoing nodes
* 4) retailer waits for the transaction to appear on their end, which should take less than 10 seconds (usually less than 5 seconds)
Your transactions will be more than sufficiently safe within a few seconds and long before you reach several confirmations. True, the chance of a successful double-spend is harder with time (and more confirmations), but for the average retail item, it's simply not necessary with the above assumptions being employed.  
For coffee, beer, or other very low value POS transactions (&lt;$50 USD), employing the above is all that a retailer needs probably 99.9999% of the time.

Using ATMs are one of the handful of growing pains.  Eventually, Bitcoin usage will be ubiquitous and ATMs will become mostly unnecessary.

Sensational journalism, clearly.  This poor "Satoshi" is about to get a lot of unwanted media attention and harassment.

Gold is widely manipulated by the current financial leaders.  While gold is better than sovereign currencies, it's not THAT much better.
This guy is a shill.  Gold and other currencies should be tied to Bitcoin.

For registered non-profit charities, you can accept Bitcoin indirectly through Bitpay:

Exactly.  Let people play with Doge money until they're comfortable using Bitcoin.  If it has any role at all, Dogecoin is a good opportunity for newbs to get the hang of using cryptocurrencies without losing any real money (i.e. Bitcoin).

Two possibilities: 1) coins were in a bank safety deposit box that was seized by the US government, 2) Karpeles and others conspired and stole the coins.
I give almost no plausibility for any other situation (i.e. someone else stole the coins).   will only be disproven if Karpeles kills himself.

What's the bounty at?

Exactly.  This is the long-term trend we've seen with Bitcoin since the beginning.  The price will rise dramatically over the next rapid growth phase, the markets will correct, but the new normal will still be much higher than where we were before.
