I got the same email! They must've got it from one of the Mt. Gox break-ins.

ASIC? I was into bitcoins more about a year ago, got out after mtgox got hacked the first time. What is ASIC?

It was below 17 for a short time, and it's right at 17 now. If it drops again before it rises I can't see it falling below 16. But I'm guessing it will average out around 22-23 isntead of 19~20. I'm surprised it's still at 17 actually, I didn't think it would last longer then 20min, and it's been 50+. 
So maybe in a few hours it'll level out above 20, if nothing crazy happens.

The original beanies are still worth boku $

Gold plating is like 2microns thick. Which is like $.001

and that's why another boom is coming.

Thanks!! I was refreshing mtgox before this

Also there's a good chance Bitcoins would be worth more in 10years, despite the current crash. 
@_date: 2011-10-22 20:27:58
Agreed, I'd prob buy some otherwise. In 10years they could be super collectable

The only difference is I'm thinking of spending $50, not $50K.
@_date: 2011-06-13 03:05:17
I think it will too. Like any other currency based on trust and not actual precious metals or what-have-you, EVERYONE has to know about it. The reason it's so volatile now is simply because it is so new. Nobody knows whether the U.S. gov't will outlaw it (which some article implied, but none supplied proof, that I know of), or if they'll embrace it. I could see the value skyrocketing as high as gold if it is accepted worldwide. ESPECIALLY since there is a set maximum amount of bitcoins in the future.

Ha, yeah I love reading back on inaccurate predictions. Working out fine for me since I have yet to invest. I still believe it will resurge once more dwolla activates more funds. Currency this volatile isn't that predictable, but I really wasn't far off. It bounced up to 17 not long ago, now near 15.

Very cool Adam, I just have one question. Is a .eps format absolutely required for submission? What I'm asking is, can I submit a tiff/jpg and if it's chosen to be a winner or final few, can I then upgrade it to an .eps file type? Until you plan to start putting these pictures on posters or banners an .eps really isn't necessary.

You could probably use the heat to make a jerry-rigged air conditioner, fridge, or freezer.
@_date: 2011-06-17 02:15:04
That really sucks, but this would explain how the rich get richer. They don't need to worry about needing the money they invest. Personally I only have 40$ invested through dwolla, thankfully I can go a while without that 40$ as a test investment

It would only take one multi-millionaire to step in with a supercomputer and come out profitable. One supercomputer could split the margin 10-fold for every other miner.

Maybe he'll smoke out the real Sathoshi creator(s).
