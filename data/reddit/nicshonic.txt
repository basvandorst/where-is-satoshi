This may seem like a paradox, but I feel like I need to respond, even though it's just going to fuel a vicious cycle of you being a jerkwad and me looking decent. So I guess I'm responding to say I'm not responding, even though, clearly, I just did. So.... There.

I know nothing about GAW Miners situation. This is the first I've heard of it. I'd like to know more, but there's nothing here. You cannot just say "It's been a collective decision that GAW Miners is a full blown ponzi scheme." Who has decided? You? "We"? "I"? Cause *I* don't know anything about this situation.
There's a reason BFL is going to court: Because there is evidence by the FTC of serious wrongdoing. But they have a chance to prove themselves innocent, because that is how justice is legally dealt. But good on you for making a "Collective Decision" that this company is a ponzi scheme, then declaring "I don't feel like recapping everything they have ever done wrong (aka, everything); but most of you should know at this point."
We don't know! Even if you are **absolutely** sure, there needs to be proof. That's why a recap is needed, so "*We*" can "*Collectively Decide*" what is happening, and come to a conclusion. And there are no links, no references, no anything. Moreover, is being a massive jerkwad and calling people like me "Blind" because "*We*" have no idea whats going on in the first place.
Come back here with some sources, some data, and some stories. Those are three separate things you are missing to make any compelling argument that this GAW company is doing anything wrong. Until then, this is libelous and defamatory, and you can and will be sued over it.
Now downvote me. I'll be back in 6 months when you've lost it all, including your marbles, if you haven't already.

While I do agree with most of that, he did actually back up his bloviating with a bet. I mildly respect that, because he did take action. Against a sea of lazy nitpickers like r/Bitcoin, that is admirable. Kinda. This is still the most delusional bet.

I know which sub I'm on. I'm asking why I should donate anything (in this case, BTC) to anyone (Here, DWB), when the pitch is "Don't use cash, use Bitcoin!". Doctors Without Borders does not accept Bitcoin, and the only source I am finding that seems to accept on DWB's behalf is [A Day Without Touch]( which is not affiliated with DWB. It is a "Solidarity Challenge", meaning it could be a scam, since there is no official recognition (at this point) via DWB. 
Moreover, DWB's own "[Donation FAQ]( has no mention of Bitcoin on it, and [a search for Bitcoin on their entire site]( produces no results. I am, therefore, forced to conclude that DWB does not officially accept Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin or any other cryptocurrency at this time, making "A Day Without Touch" a questionable means to aid.
So, let me rephrase the original post, which was meant to be a jab at OP's use of quotation marks: Why are we questioning the use of Cash over Bitcoin, when there is no reputable way to send BTC to Doctors Without Borders?
If you can find a DWB-qualified charity that will accept Bitcoin, I will gladly donate all of my BTC, cause, quite frankly, I can't find any other way to use it. Its sat in a Coinbase account for a year now, and I have no idea what it could be used for. I would love to be rid of it, and to donate to a great cause as Doctors Without Borders, which Charity Navigator has given them [a near perfect score]( I would do it in an instant. At the same time, I've already donated $20 by Visa, which will help them now, as opposed to waiting for x number of days [for it to transfer on Coinbase]( by which time, more people will have died.

I was actually looking into that just for fun. There are many instances of the FTC losing injunctions, including [this one]( &amp; [this one]( Its not a whole lot, but its enough to make the point that they have in fact lost injunctions, and are not some omnipotent Denny Crane-type law superpower that has never lost a single case, ever, ever, ever, as BFL keeps implying in court docs.

There have been those. One, for example, was [Operation INFEKTION]( which was created by the KGB to spread anti-American ideals, by saying HIV/AIDS was created at Fort Detrick in Maryland. [A study in 2005]( showed, out of a group of 500 African-Americans (Who make up around 50% of new infections, yearly), half believed the disease was man made. A quarter said it was done in a US government lab, and 12 percent said the CIA made it.

Yes, because he made up entirely new mathematical concepts. Its like if I handed you a map and invented 5 new directions on the compass, didn't tell you which way they pointed, and just expected you to figure it out eventually. That's what he has done with his proof: he has created abstract concepts inside a theoretical new type of mathematics ("[anabelian geometry]( that the article [I linked to]( claims only 50 people in the entire world are able to even come close to understanding, and even they are having trouble with it. Why? If you scroll down to part B in that article, you can read about how Mochizuki then invented something he calls "Inter-Universal Geometry", and wrote the bulk of the proof in that concept. And I really need to stress here that Inter-Universal Geometry is his concept. No one had seen it, heard of it or anything before he published his paper. He made up a brand new mathematical tool, and just expects others to use it without an instructional manual to explain what the heck it even is. Its now less "He's a genius we are all ignoring" and more "He's a genius who put out a proof only he can understand", because that is literally what is going on. He put out a 4 part, 500+ page proof using concepts he made up, and so far only he can understand. And that's why you couldn't have skimmed it.
Furthermore, maybe this is why Satoshi walked away from Bitcoin. Because he did his thing, put it out there, and saw the community degrade itself [time]( after [time]( after [time]( again. Maybe Satoshi just wanted out because he was embarrassed and didn't want a cult on his tail, should he ever be outed. And maybe that's why every smart guy accused of being him denies it outright, because owning it is a death sentence.

As someone with station experience (4+ Years at TVCTV Boise, &amp; various KTVB work), I can tell you what would happen:
1. An investigation into you, because its always a slow news day for local teams. Plus, in this era where everything gets spread online, we'd look great for researching this, and you'd look like a huge jerk. End of story here.
2. Nothing. Or slightly more than nothing. We'd get your info and call the cops, then probably not do much more because what exactly is the story here? "Local jerkwad tries to convert hungry kid to weird version of Yen, gets arrested"? It sounds interesting, but really flesh it out and you see why it wouldn't make good news: This isn't really a crime, its just some guy picking on a kid. Point one only works because we need to fill air time, and want to "Go after the (perceived) bad guy".
There is literally no other scenario that could possibly occur, based on my training and experience, in regard to this idiotic plan. No respectable media outlet would dare touch this, and even the Buzzfeed's of the world wouldn't go near it, because of the tedious explanation of what Bitcoin even is.
Your story, if there even would be one, would be perceived as "A guy tried to get another, younger kid to tell us about an online currency, and, in return, he would get soup". How the heck does this fit into the inverted pyramid?

You do realize real economists use forecasts and data, and not just articles to see how economies will shift, right? Also, "This guy is pretty optimistic" is not proof, its an opinion.

There was evidence well in advance of both cases. Buttcoin tried to warn about pirateat40 and was banned from the BitcoinTalk forums by theymos, while Harry Markopolos tried to warn about Madoff a full decade before the scheme ended. That decade long story is told in the book "No One Would Listen".
Now go find me some sources.

God, the anonymous creator of everything, actually wondered about the same question. His solution, after some incredibly hard thinking and an incredible amount of hard work, was the Father, the Son and last but not least the Holy Spirit. This is one of the greatest achievements in human history. Therefore, I advice (advice?) you to read everything possible about God and I'm sure you will come to the conclusion that it will be nearly impossible to improve life in general. Especially mine.

Here's the main problem I'm seeing here: you cannot "Skim" through the ABC Conjecture, especially the proposed solution to it, and expect to have solved time travel or Satochi's identity or whatever it is you are proposing.
The ABC Conjecture is one of the most mathematically challenging problems of all time, and the proof Mr. Mochizuki has written is 512 pages. The Boston Globe has called the proof "[...too tough even for mathematicians]( How the heck are you, the eager Bitcoin lover, supposed to skim through either 512 pages of the worlds most boring novel or even just a few paragraphs of the Wikipedia entry, and suddenly you're Doctor Who?
As for mathematics important to Bitcoin and computers overall, P vs. NP is a lot more important. Go skim that, then tell me you solved it with a toilet paper tube and some chicken wire.
