Ahh, the Joey special.

More like Brannigans law. Hard and fast!

This is either sarcasm or attention seeking. Either way, just do it.

It's definitely drugs

You're too late

Hodling a lot of btc doesn't mean you have any real money, silly. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:55:15
That's cute 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:50:18
So you're pretty overqualified for posting here. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:57:41
Ooh have we got a video?

Be very careful here because asking questions like this online is a good way to gett scammed out of your money. Don't trust anyone if they offer to buy for you and transfer it to your bitcoin wallet, that's how my friend's dumbass 16yo kid lost £100 to someone that contacted them on reddit. 
Try localbitcoin, there are vendors on there that don't require ID but you will be paying a lot more for the btc.

I couldn't believe how many places still don't have chip and pin!!
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:27:50
Dude, that is a perfect analogy of the situation!

12k is the point where I officially doubled my investment. I'm not going anywhere with this, it's just nice to say. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:28:15
Well yes I understand that. What I can't figure out is how to find the address to send the funds to on my electrum wallet. Hence the reason I asked for a job guide.

£7000 next, keep it coming!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:28:56
At least it didn't go down on your wife like it did with mine!
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:33:25
Come on my fellow Brit!! Let's officially over egg this pudding!

Ive started charging my phone downstairs and using my old trusty radio alarm again. It's nice waking up to the radio and also quite nice checking bitcoin prices when I go make the morning coffee. 
I've felt much healthier the last few days wince I started doing this. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:46:33
I used coinbase, very user friendly 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:07:41
No they are in coinbase but I have read that going via gdax is the best way to avoid fees 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:36:40
Coinbase. About the easiest way to get in to it.
