I believe that is where transaction fees come in. 
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:52:15
So you agree it is theft.

You're welcome, Hitler.

If you're not trading, surely the amount of bitcoin you have is the same?
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:42:35
I'm not breaking any laws. Now, the IRS on the other hand. Taxation is theft.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:44:18
Trading works for me.

MR PATEL!

Everything you've listed there except America is a service that I'm willing to pay for it if I wanted
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:22:35
1) I do not consent to it. You saying I do, doesn't make it so. (this is the theft bit)
2)I do not know that it is necessary for a nation to function. I'm fairly certain that has never been tested.
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:34:27
Still theft
@_date: 2019-11-29 09:32:52
Yes. It's generally regarded as the safest long term investment strategy. It can also be an effective way to trade. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:41:09
No I don't.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:27:34
That's all wonderful, still doesn't change the fact that taxation is theft.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:07:25
I never said anything about viability. I am simply saying taxation is theft. Saying otherwise is delusional.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:17:40
No. You are saying that.
@_date: 2019-11-29 09:29:01
smaller buys at regular intervals. Like once a month, rather than one big lump sum.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:28:18
I'm not consenting to it.
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:42:17
What ever you need to say to explain away your Stockholm syndrome. You are being robbed and you are defending your robbers like the good little statist that you are. Sad.
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:03:29
I do. And I do not consent to taxation. It's hardly worth calling it tax if there is consent for it now is it.
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:31:02
Just because you can justify it doesn't mean it isn't theft. I did not consent to it. It is taken against my will. It is theft.
@_date: 2019-11-19 19:21:03
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:44:38
You live in a deluded fantasy world.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:59:59
As previously stated, you are a delusional statist.
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:38:07
No I didn't.
@_date: 2019-11-13 22:33:53
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:13:06
MOAR BOOSTERS!!
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:23:43
It's windows defrag /s
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:56:50
None of that changes the fact that taxation is theft.
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:17:49
I'll happily pay my share for the things that I use that said taxation still theft
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:37:14
I don't know you or where you live, but if you think it is possible to just pick up sticks and move somewhere else in the world at the drop of a hat, then you are retarded. Trying to say taxation isnt theft is like arguing that water isn't wet. 
It is theft, no matter how you want to sugar coat it.  Bloody statists.
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:29:57
Horseshit. 
I have not consented to anything. I was never given a choice without threat of violence or incarceration and there is no option to go somewhere where there is no taxation.

!remind me 1 year
@_date: 2019-08-05 06:41:59
We all value your opinion... so much.
@_date: 2019-06-12 09:47:52
What price would bitcoin have to reach for 1 satoshi to = 1 dollar?
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:55:26
Am I fucked or unfucked? I'm too scared to check.
@_date: 2019-12-09 08:29:05
 *“It really do be like that sometimes”*
@_date: 2019-12-05 09:37:10
After then.

@_date: 2018-02-02 16:40:06
Yes and his rating was that it was ok not the best. Hence 5/7
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:19:36
I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:23:26
 
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:15:27
when you look at India's bureaucratic system and realise that it can't cope with a billion + population you'll understand.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:35:05
:/ you've misused the 5/7 meme though...
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:18:20
You sound like that special flavour of person who has never interacted with a member of the opposite sex in any meaningful or emotional way. You're far too smart for that ��
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:44:41
Do you even hear yourself?��
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:43:31
Just in case people were not sure of this guys qualifications to talk about Bitcoin

What are you talking about you sad penis? You ever heard of Shakespeare? Do you understand what a joke is? Are you sure you're right about me?
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:21:35
I don't think you know what a strawman is.

@_date: 2018-04-23 16:17:17
Did you just assume my rape status? How dare you!
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:36:02
Yes. 
My response would be "TIL - I have been serially raped my entire life."
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:58:24
I'm guessing you haven't watched the video then.
Also, I think you may be shadow banned
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:12:38
I could only see your comment in my replies, looks okay now.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:32:11
It's called a joke you sad penis. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:49:36
No it wasn't. 
You (Direct quote) - EVERYONE has to ask for permission to have sex with another person. We call non-consent “rape”.
Response - TIL I'm a serial rapist.
There is literally no misrepresenting your argument. In fact, you misrepresented your own argument  by attaching the 'non-verbal' caveat in your follow-up post.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:30:15
Show me on this doll where the bad person touched you.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:40:07
My payday always lands on the day after the price shoots back up. Every. Damn. Time.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:51:34
why?
