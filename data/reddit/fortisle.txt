Awesome tinfoil hat theory.
My rebuttal: the management cost and investment required to pull off such a stunt would be so high that it would be more efficient for any nation to invest limited resources in saving their national currency or buying into the bitcoin ecosystem benevolently.
It would be more likely that they'd just blow up the miners of others in one giant global airstrike. Same result but it only requires military assets which are readily available. Best defence against that is the market's assurance that as the risk of major miner destruction increases, the value of running an independent miner also increases.

It will always remain the same percent of the total volume traded, but it will build up in nominal terms.

Americans are free to spend their income on insurance, or on whatever else they choose.
It seems that your main problem is that "some people don't have much" in America. That point is true. 
Most Americans do not feel that it is right to take from one person, just to give to another. They prefer to respect individual liberty and the right of each person to use his own earnings as he chooses.
Americans DO believe in charity - we are the most charitable nation on earth - and we are glad to give to those in need, if we voluntarily choose to do so. However, most of us do not feel like we should take someone else's money just because we decided that someone else needs it more.
There's an obvious cost to this - if I lack the resources to help a poor person, I can't just take money from someone else to help him. Thus, he might not get any help at all.
There's also a benefit though. When everyone agrees NOT to forcefully take each other's earnings, everyone knows that whatever they earn, they keep. They also know that if they want to be secure and enjoy material fruits of labor, they must work to produce. That's a large part of what makes America so productive and allows everyone to benefit (such that even the poor in America are wealthier than most of the world).

Great write up on the history, thanks. Also interesting view on the prohibition of inside trading.
I, however, don't find the logic to be convoluted. It only makes sense that people should be better off using all available information when making decisions on what to buy and sell, or where to invest. Prohibiting people from using relevant information to make investment decisions will of course reduce the efficiency of market pricing. Better pricing actually means that all investors will be more likely to get a fair price when they buy or sell.
On the other hand I find rationalization for limiting the use of information in trading difficult to follow. Suggesting that prohibiting the the use of much information to trade will be more "fair" because it leaves room for some retail investor to exploit the inefficiency himself later on (which in practice does not happen) to me seems as ridiculous as banning strong men from working as laborers because it's not fair to the weak men. That is, those who are best suited to the task are prohibited from action so that someone else less well positioned might do so instead. 
Furthermore there are obvious enforcement costs to preventing voluntary exchange. All for no proven benefit but the vague concept of "fairness" ( even though pricing will be less accurate and therefore less fair).

Yes, many people, including many rich people, think it's fair to take money from one person and give it to another.
Many other people disagree.
Some disagree because they feel it is morally wrong to take what is not theirs. Others disagree because they do not want to be the one from whom resources are taken. Still others believe that all will be better off with mutual agreement not to take from each other, because perverse incentives are minimized.

It depends how its financed. If free people voluntarily offers safety nets and benefits out of charity or in exchange, it would be compatible with a free world.

Yea, but bitcoin is a great tool to move money offshore. Once you have bitcoin, you could easily move it into bitreserve, or circle, or coinbase, or any other platform that allows you to lock value in terms of another fiat like USD.
@_date: 2015-06-25 23:16:07
I can't deny the benefits of giving people healthcare.
That's why I work hard to help other people. Despite that, I don't believe it's right to take from others simply because I think I know how to spend it better than they do (or because I'll spend their money on a "good cause").
Furthermore, taking money from people earned it and giving to those who didn't discourages hard work.
Besides... problem with taking each others' money is, how do you know everyone will spend it on good causes, once you get started? I prefer to just agree NOT to take each others' money in the first place. 
It's morally right to respect individual liberty AND time has proven it creates better living conditions for rich and poor alike.

Raising rates is synonymous with reducing the current money supply, which would likely reduce the dollar price of gold and bitcoin.
You're right though that if people find the short term reduction in gdp unappealing, they may reverse course and increase the money supply again (reducing rates). I agree that would push bitcoin and gold prices higher.
I guess I agree with everything you said, but I wouldn't say that the long term impact of raising rates is a higher bitcoin price in dollar terms. The short term reduction in the supply of USD money/credit is definitely a setback in the trend of long term expected increase in BTCUSD. A temporary setback, yes, but a setback nonetheless.

Generally, the current market price of ANY asset, including bitcoin, is a good representation of the value of holding it (including all pros and cons).
For bitcoin, the current price of ~350 almost certainly reflects significant uncertainty &amp; risk, but also the potential for significant upside.
Thus, it IS a worthy long term investment (as part of a diversified portfolio) if you believe the technology is useful.

Rapid deflation will create a bias towards under-consumption, to the same extent that rapid inflation will create a bias towards over consumption. Both situations are equally destructive, although under-consumption is often perceived as much worse.
Fortunately, neither moderate deflation nor inflation are particularly destructive. In the late 1800s the USA saw moderate deflation but significant rises in real income. In the late 1900s, the USA saw moderate inflation but significant increases in real income. 
When it comes to rapid inflation and deflation, they both occur more frequently and drastically under fiat regimes, than under hard money regimes (I.e. a working gold standard). For example the inflation in the 1920s and the subsequent deflation during the depression were caused by significant growth in the money supply during WWI followed by a drastic reduction in the money supply. Had the money supply remained constant, the overconsumption of the 20s and subsequent underconsumption of the 30s would have been less severe.
Thus bitcoin will serve as a stabilizing and beneficial factor in the world economy.

You could just as easily (and just as incorrectly) ask why dollars have so much value when the paper money technology would work equally well at $10,000 per big mac.
The answer lies in the fundamental supply and demand equation for money.
Quantity / Demand = Price

Mention how much bitcoin is used for charity. These charities are some of the many that take bitcoin:
The United Way
Wikimedia Foundation
That library in Ferguson...
Then say that besides just charity, bitcoin has even MORE uses... Dell, Overstock, Newegg, Expedia, 1-800 Flowers. All these businesses use bitcoin for regular old shopping!
Additionally bitcoin is used for donations to many politicians and political parties. Additionally bitcoin is used for international payments. Additionally bitcoin is used to settle debts between friends. Additionally bitcoin is used to enable international micro-lending, helping the global economy grow... the list goes on.

Thank YOU!
Second idea I had today - I would gladly contribute to keeping changetip a free service. If I could donate a certain amount to push the 0% fee period a bit further, I'd do it!
I bet if you pegged a reasonable price per day, the donations would flood in and you could use the funding to keep the service free for a long time!

There's a million business decisions that are immaterial to Wal-Mart on their own. In fact most individual employees are immaterial. The question is not of materiality, it is of net present value. The collective sum of a million immaterial decisions will help the company materially.
Both the costs and the benefits of the program are small, but on the whole it would probably benefit Wal-Mart.

a predictable schedule and future limit is sufficient.

You don't ever need a coinbase wallet. You will not pay any fees to coinbase. When you make a purchase, you send bitcoins from your circle wallet for 0% fee and that's it.

If you analytical skills are so strong I'd recommend proving those skills to yourself by trading in short term markets. If you can predict long term trends with perfect confidence, you should be able to predict short term market movements reliably, thereby making money and proving your ability!
If you fail to consistently generate short term gains, you ought to reconsider the strength of your long term thesis.

Great idea! Please update the community if the policy is amended, because I would donate (again) if RMHofA decides to experiment with efficient ways to use bitcoin directly.
A large reason why many people donate is to help increase the network of users, so your choice to spend bitcoin, in addition to accepting it, would surely prompt more donations.

Walmart still pays significant interchange fees and has tight margins.
@_date: 2014-12-20 14:21:40
Because significant investment would have to be made to do so. I'm a big fan of merchant adoption and consider it very necessary for growth, but there are other much more likely places to take bitcoin first. Namely any online merchant or any offline merchant that already has self checkout
@_date: 2014-11-08 14:57:36
Average consumer still shouldn't use bitcoin except when there are sales or they are getting round censorship. (sales on newegg, etc; bypassing censorship for online gambling etc)
I personally spend bitcoin when I can only because I want to help push the bitcoin economy forward so I can eventually ONLY use bitcoin.
When I can use only bitcoin for all my spending etc, it will save me the cost of using dollars at all.

The bit license should be compared to the status quo ( no bit license) rather than to intolerable suggestions made earlier this year.
1. Exchanges will be heavily regulated. Software developers, merchants, miners, consumers and investors may all be subject to regulation, depending on circumstances and interpretation of laws.
2. 7 years of record retention will become mandatory, exposing consumers to additional risk of data breach.
3. No businesses will be permitted to operate without getting government approval first.

I think people most easily understand that bitcoin is "legit" when they hear about the many well known organizations that find bitcoin useful: Dell, Expedia, Wikipedia, The Red Cross, The United Way, 1800 Flowers.... etc.

Legal tender is defined by what payment the courts will allow to satisfy a debt. Even if people think bitcoin is legal tender, the courts may not agree. It's a silly distinction but some governing bodies consider it important.

The advice above is best. Key points are:
1. Real assets (stocks) generate solid returns. Invest &gt;30% in stocks. Even 70% is a good number.
2. Get the degree (you're so close already) and get a job. 125k is not enough to retire on. Work gives your life purpose and affords you material luxury.
3. Anything north of $10k in bitcoin (at current prices) is enough to retire on if bitcoin goes to the moon. You can be generous and put $20k in bitcoin.
20k - bitcoin
85k - diversified stock portfolio (vanguard ETFs)
20k - cover short term expenses while you get your degree and find a job

"The price increase would be offset by velocity"
More spending could equate to the same velocity. Velocity is dictated by the ratio of currency held to currency spent per period of time, and that ratio would not necessarily increase with greater adoption. There's no reason to believe it would. Velocity has practical limitations driven by people's desire to hold enough money to finance upcoming purchases.
TLDR adoption would rise, price would rise, velocity wouldn't necessarily change
Ask questions if that didn't make sense.

I'm glad to hear that bitcoin has made you excited about saving, but you and other **readers should know that a diversified market portfolio of stocks is a great long term investment.** Over hundreds of years across many many countries, diversified equity portfolios have generated strong long term returns.
To invest in "railroads" would have been a mistake only because you would not have been well diversified. If instead you had invested in a broad sample of the market, you would have done well.
Stocks are a good investment.
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:22:49
I agree, though it may depend on the nature of the crisis. In the case of high consumer price inflation and a debt crisis in the USA, alternatives to the dollar, including bitcoin, will probably rise in price dramatically.
If instead there is a credit crisis (falling supply of dollar credit instruments) the dollar value of bitcoin may fall.

That's a well thought out post, I would only add one point.
The preference to hold bitcoin will be affected by how easily a holder can eventually trade it for other goods and services. If virtually all merchants accept bitcoin, I will place a higher value on bitcoin because it will be easy for me to spend it at some point.

@_date: 2014-11-25 16:18:14
It all depends on who the parties are.
Since I use both dollars and bitcoin, for me to send/receive bitcoin to/from any other bitcoin user is trivially easy.

In the long term, the underlying securities will have positive expected returns (which is bad for the seller). The short seller is betting that the growth in his liabilities will be less than the growth in his assets.
Here's an example:
I sell short $1000 of google, and hold the $1000 in bitcoin on the site. In one year imagine google has risen 1% and paid a 1% dividend, meaning ending value of the security is ~$1020. If the dollar price of bitcoin had risen 5%, I could settle the contract and have surplus BTC.
Does that make sense? This equation is similar for short sellers in any market, not just my hypothetical platform.
@_date: 2014-11-21 13:30:03

If you don't think bitcoin is or will be useful "to pay something, to store or transfer value" because alternatives exist, then you're hypothesis is probably accurate - price won't increase.

Advocates of bitcoin don't believe it's useful for escaping short term volatility. Instead, it's more useful for escaping long term devaluation through inflation.
It's difficult to statistically prove that fixed supply will offer long term price stability (and growth) for bitcoin by observing bitcoin's history because the sample size is so small. However, it's not difficult to see the long term cause &amp; effect relationship between supply and price in other monies including gold, silver, the dollar, the yen, and the pound.
By observing the long term price movements in those forms of money, we can extrapolate how supply impacts long term price action. Doing so, it becomes clear that long term price growth is inversely correlated to supply growth. Fiat currencies guarantee significant supply growth, while gold and silver have naturally limited supply, and bitcoin has mathematically limited supply.
By this method we can understand that although each of the aforementioned monies may vary in price and volatility in the short term, bitcoin is unlikely to suffer from long term (i.e. 10+ year) devaluation, unlike the dollar etc.

the "raising" of interest rates is a market phenomena
the government, a market player, sells off or runs off the assets on the books of the fed, thereby reducing the supply and increasing demand for dollars.
this can be thought of as "artificial" or it could be thought of as an END to artificial action, as the fed unwinds it's current positions that have "artificially" increased the money supply.
The fed can't avoid impacting interest rates, because even "inaction" is a type of action (i.e. running off assets by collecting receivables over time)
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:37:21
I don't necessarily believe it will, without other shocks. Historically, fiat currencies have done a fairly good job maintaining low rates of inflation when governments have no fiscal issues and avoid wars.
However, the long term inevitability of government fiscal issues and war implies that even the dollar will likely be debased.
By hedging dollar exposure with bitcoin, you avoid some of the relatively trivial cost of annual inflation, and also the potentially high cost of dollar collapse in the event of a shock accelerating the decline of the dollar.

The basic concept is as follows:
9 people each deposit $1 into a bank. The owner of the bank also has $1 invested. If each of the depositor wants to withdraw his money on demand, the bank shouuld have the money available to give back.
BUT instead of keeping the 9 deposited dollars in a vault, the bank will lend out 8 of them.
The $2 that remain in the bank's vault ($1 from deposits, $1 from the bank owner) are considered the "reserve." Since the reserve is only 2/9ths of the total deposits, it's considered a "fractional reserve."
The main problem is that if too many depositors try to withdraw at once, the bank won't have enough money on hand.
That's pretty much it!
I'm happy to answer any other questions about banks etc.. I work at a financial institution.

Buy enough computer power to control the majority of the network, start mining selfishly. Solve blocks independently, without sharing with the network, then releasing them to stay ahead of the network. Collect 100% of miner fees, destroying the incentive for other participants to keep mining.
Once you have centralized control of the mining process, continue to mine, but begin excluding all transactions from all blocks.
Miners will be driven out of the market quickly initially since mining will rapidly become unprofitable once you enter the market and drive difficulty way up, increasing the rate at which you will achieve majority power.

Can you give me instructions on how to prove I own one or more of these? Each of these produces new addresses when I use it.
Ultimately though, the fact that I owned the URL's in the first place, which were produced from my entropy, seems to be proof enough that I own them.

That's not quite how it works.
They may lend out $10 for every $1 of *equity* but not for every dollar of deposits. It's the deposits that make up the other $9 of loans beyond the equity.
Your fundamental point is still correct though - the fiat banking system with massive depository institutions is less safe and less stable than would be a bitcoin alternative.
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:51:30
As long as it's slow and steady, there is no real harm. Unfortunately, fiat currency inflation isn't always slow and steady.
"Motivates investment" really just means hold smaller real balances in cash, which doesn't imply more efficient allocation of real capital.
Stable Low rates of deflation, as seen for example in the late 1800's in the USA, does not have significant negative impact. During this period there was rapid real growth and also deflation.
Money "sitting" or "invested" is not what drives real growth. Rather, it's the efficiency of real capital allocation.

I see - you hypothesize that with efficient financial networks each individual could easily spend his income as he earns it, making velocity very high and price relatively low.
I would argue that even though financial networks may facilitate rapid payment, that actually does NOT imply higher velocity. Instead, individuals may choose to hold large balances of cash (or bitcoin) as savings, even though only a small balance is "needed" to cover immediate expenses.
I think with inflationary currency like the dollar, efficient and liquid markets would drive up velocity since non-cash instruments like bank credit become better substitutes with higher real yield, causing individuals to hold smaller real balances in cash. 
-however, with fixed supply currency, higher real yield can only come from taking on more risk. a more efficient payment network may not cause people to hold less value in currency when that currency generates positive real yield.
Math: (Money Demand) * (Price) = (Money Supply) = (output) / (velocity) * (price) 
Money Demand = Output / Velocity
Where money demand is how much value people want to hold in cash

I think you're asking all the right questions, but those are the reasons I'm excited for bitcoin!
The fluctuations in risk aversion in the public causes massive volatility in "low risk" credit products. A smaller credit market will mean less volatility.
Governments have a history of causing volatility in price of money, and therefore the economy, by controlling money and credit supply. The history shows that the volatility does more harm that good - politicians are usually unable to outsmart free markets.

Very interesting, thanks. As users reduce their transactions (starting with lowest priority), where do you think the trade off should be between keeping block size small enough and still facilitating increasingly high priority transactions if price keeps moving up along the vertical supply curve?
Asked another way: what do you think should be the max fee (roughly), before it's worth it to expand capacity via block size increase, if user growth exceeds capacity growth by segwit, and LN?
Like clearly if it's $0.02 it's not an issue, but clearly if it was $100 that would be a problem (unless I'm wrong about that?). But where do you think the tipping point is?

My question is serious, though I see how perhaps only a "order of magnitude" estimate is possible, like the one you provided. That answer helps me understand better already. 
If demand were great enough to push fees to $5, it may (correct me if I'm wrong or misunderstood) still make sense to maintain the current block size since the risks associated with increasing the block size as a remedy are greater than the lost utility of the transactions that are worth less than $5.
I think I probably fail to fully appreciate what those risks may be, because I initially wouldn't have guessed tolerable tx fees would be high. My assumption is genuinely that i don't fully understand the situation though.

I thought you said people would execute fewer transactions, but maybe I misunderstood. Maybe "usage" has a definition other than transactions, so each person's usage can stay the same if they use fewer transactions to accomplish the same goals?

A few ways to fight it:

2) convince other people to do the same
3) sue them for corruption, or anything else you can pin them on. even if you lose, your actions will reduce the appeal of imposing such bad regulations in the future. (that's what the church of scientology did to the IRS, and it worked)

@_date: 2015-08-06 01:48:21
Sure, good points.
I suppose all future expected coins that will be mined are already priced into the market by those who plan to buy them, or mine them, in the future.
Thus a constant price is just a product of constant expectations - those who planned to acquire the fresh coins have done so.
Alternatively, you could hypothesize that the market has not planned ahead and fresh coins would cause price reductions were it not for new buyers... probably not though.

@_date: 2015-08-21 12:07:01
Thanks, I really appreciate the heads up. I had been selling some of the coins I bought on coinbase exchange via circle.
I disagree with your feelings about circle overall though. I believe they should have given you a warning before closing the account, but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask you not to exploit their pricing structure.
In my mind what we were doing was similar to going to an ice cream shop and eating 100 free samples every week, then walking out. Circle offers 0% spread and 0% fees, despite the (small) cost of ACH transfers and market impact. They do this for customer convenience, but if you are levering up to exploit their free offering, they have a right to refuse you service.
Personally I sympathize with their situation. They are forced to choose between implementing a spread (which would be damaging to the user experience) or being vulnerable to arbitrage. They are choosing the latter option, then minimizing losses with a vague TOS clause.
Personally I think a better option would be if they implemented a spread for customers that were performing arbitrage, though this would probably get an outcry as well about it being "unfair"
What do you all think is the best solution for them?

Well all of the people who "bought" the new coins, actuallly DID buy all the electricity and equipment, which allowed them to harvest the coins. In an efficient market, the price they paid for to acquire coins by mining is equal to the price they could have paid to purchase them through other means.

That's true, USD would have also been profitable for him in this case. I think his goal was to point on the inherent weakness of fiat (supply manipulation &amp; inability to move it electronically without 3rd party cooperation).
At some point in the future USD could also see capital controls and huge supply increases. For bitcoin, we know this will never happen.

Typically a market maker will have a spread between their bid and ask price to make up for the fact that they don't know where the price will move next. Circle has no spread, for customer convenience, but because of this, they end up buying bitcoin when it goes down and selling when it goes up.
For example, imagine that a big buyer comes in and purchases all coins available for $250. The price would move up to $251 and circle would have to reset its price there. Then the seller could resell his coins to circle at $251. Free money.
That's the same principle at play.

If you're smart enough to know a good investment when you see one (i.e. bitcoin), then you'll be able to identify new and different opportunities for investment later on.
There are an infinite number of investment opportunities and there will always be more. Any wise investor knows that the cost of missing a single opportunity is low, but the cost of making a single bad investment is much higher.
Besides, if you're right and bitcoin does succeed, the world will be a much better place for it, and a myriad of new tangential investment opportunities will arise as the world changes. **Work hard, earn money, and keep your eyes open for future opportunities. They will come.**

You will not find a price better than Circle's net of fees in your market. If you did, you could arbitrage between the two. Circle's price is the market price. The price available through other exchanges is not the true price since it often excludes fees. Coinbase, just like all other exchanges, has a bid that's lower (net of fees) than circle's and ask that's higher (net of fees) than circle's.
Ultimately it will just take time for the bid ask spread offered by other platforms to come down and create "one price" where the bid ask is so small it's negligible on most platforms.

You would have to have a huge edge. What would the edge be? If it's "faith", you're doing it wrong. If it's superior ability to analyze the monetary landscape, you should be able to apply the same skills to other bets and thus you would still want to diversify.

You see a price that's below the value of the asset to you, so you sell.
There is no legal limit to how much you can sell as an individual.

It's amazing how much the quality of the market has improved thanks to bitcoin. I went to check out the site, and immediately noticed the chasm between the bid and the ask on nfl games. Checking against my go-to site, fairlay.com, I noticed that there was actually an opportunity for arbitrage on the giants/patriots game.
Not being one to pass up an opportunity for some fun arbitrage, I went to place a bet on Sportsbook. Wait... I have to register before placing a bet?? Ugh. Wait they want to know full name, my home address, and my date of birth????? Fuck that. Then I come on here and read that they have slow/no pays. Negative talk on here combined with a shitty job of setting odds leads me to believe that they are not a well run shop.

High interest rates doesn't have to mean a strong dollar. Nominal interest rates just measure the value difference between the current dollar and the future dollar. A high interest rate means the current dollar is valued more highly than a future dollar, but it doesn't mean that the current dollar has a high absolute value. It very possible that interest rates will rise only because of a loss in faith of the future value of the dollar, as might be the case if excessive future money printing is expected.
I understand this doesn't really change the points you were making. I just wanted to mention it.

But then you still need to determine what the future fundamental value is...
Fundamentally, the price of money is set by the demand, given a certain supply. Specifically, **people will desire to hold a certain *real value* in money. Since supply is fixed, that value is achieved by adjustments in the price level (the exchange rate between real goods &amp; services and money).**
Example: each citizen wishes to hold 10% of the value of his real assets (i.e. house, car) in a super liquid financial instrument (money) so that he can cover immediate expenses. If the total supply of money (in units) is equal to the total supply of real goods (in units) you would expect the exchange rate to be 10:1 money to goods (price = 10 monetary units per real unit), which will mean that society, and thus each individual holds the desired 10% of real value in money.

Thanks for explaining. I see that you are correct; since the $1 used to repay the loan isn't going to the public - it's going back to the fed, it cannot be "earned" and used again to repay the second dollar of the $2 obligation.

A high CAPE ratio could easily be justified by high expected future inflation. If the inflation is realized, the CAPE ratio can come down, while stock prices do not. The signal given by the CAPE ratio does not necessarily imply high likelihood of a crash.

Cool article. Thanks for sharing this research.
Deflation driven by rapid shrinkage of the money &amp; credit supply will cause under-consumption and inefficient capital allocation (see great depression). Shrinkage in money/credit supply occurs, people think they have relatively less money than they actually do since prices haven't adjusted, demand falls below efficient levels, prices adjust painfully. 
Deflation caused by economic growth under fixed supply money regime... supply increases, owners of that supply have good visibility into the growth of supply in the market and can adjust prices downward at an efficient rate. Not much inefficient capital allocation occurs.

edit 2: I realize **I was actually wrong,** thanks to MrMadden's comment. Since the only existing dollar is repayed to the fed, it cannot be "earned back," assuming the fed issues dollars only in exchange for debt.
However, it may still be an oversimplification since the fed's interest earnings are not destroyed, they are paid to the treasury, keeping them in circulation.

The author didn't try selling on circle. If he did, he would have found that the exchange rate is the same for buying or selling. If you want to say they have a "hidden fee" for purchases, you would also have to concede they have a "hidden rebate" for sales.
I could buy and sell 100 times on circle and my expected loss will be 0%. Not so with coinbase.
You're confusing the exchange rate with the fee, or spread. Circle has no fee and no spread. They have a different exchange rate, but that rate goes both ways. If it's a disadvantage for buyers it's equally so an advantage for sellers.

Interest rates measure the value difference between a current and future dollar. QE devalues the current dollar so that it's close to parity with a future dollar.
At some point the population may lose faith in the future value of the dollar, driving up interest rates despite whatever current action the fed takes.

Since money and liquid credit instruments like bank deposits are substitutes, you'll need to consider the changing supply of both money and credit (along with demand for money and credit) to calculate the price level (and thus any change).
Two factors ate likely keeping the price level below 2x despite growth in money supply: the supply of credit has not expanded 2x and the demand for money is higher than it was in 2000.

It's an interesting move. It gives a lot less flexibility to the lenders, which  don't like. I definitely prefer bitlendingclub's model where lenders  (and borrowers) can choose rates.
I imagine the lack of flexibility with the BTCJam model will cause problems during times of volatility. Essentially, they're using a centralized solution vs. letting the market set rates. It might work, but it will be a huge challenge.

I agree that a retailer won't tip bitcoin into mass usage - it's just a tipping point for online adoption which will help lay the groundwork for eventual mass adoption when more significant drivers push people away from fiat (like a currency crisis).

"Majority of economy experts think that a slight inflation is in fact healthiest"
Although most prominent economists today would agree, there are many, many notable economists who disagree. Economics is a science and the majority is not necessarily right. In this case, the minority is correct; fixed supply will be better for the economy. Therefore, I would vote for the current system.
Furthermore, people DO have the opportunity to vote! I have voted for bitcoin's fixed supply system by purchasing, using, and advocating the use of bitcoin. Market participants are free to vote with their dollars by choosing an inflationary altcoin. Dogecoin for example will continue to print doges forever. The fact is, the market is choosing bitcoin because most people see the wisdom of fixed supply. Thus, the answer to your question would be "The market votes for the current system."

I think it's the same with many government programs - when you hold the power it feels as though it is incorruptible. Bankers believe that the power held by the bank is wielded for good.
It's even hypothetically possible (though practically impossible) that a central bank could manipulate the money supply in a way that would improve market efficiency. The problem is that few central bankers will admit that they lack the ability make the most efficient choices on behalf of everyone else. Everyone thinks they can outsmart the market!

I believe that's right. In fact you can specifically identify what it is they believe they are achieving. Increases in the money supply cause people to feel richer than they are, as prices take time to adjust, but the money enters someone's pocket as it is printed. The process of equilibrium being reached when new money is printed involves increased levels of spending which, importantly, is often misinterpreted to imply a strong, healthy, or "good" economy.
The inverse is true of deflation. When the supply of money and liquid credit instruments (a money substitute) shrinks, people feel poorer and prices must adjust downwards to set a new equilibrium. The mechanism by which prices fall is that market players try to save more money and sell more goods and services. This causes a short term reduction to GDP and is interpreted as a "bad" economy. 
Both over and under consumption are inefficient, but the former is seen as "good" and the latter as "bad." Since people feel rich during periods of over-consumption and poor during periods of under-consumption.
This phenomenon leads to politicians actually believing that inflation will help the economy and deflation will harm it. I don't believe they are malicious, merely ignorant.
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:58:27
yea the law is the same in both cases, but the practical implications are not. it's very easy to privately secure bitcoin and spend them as you wish, unlike a bank account over which you don't have full legal control

Blythe masters' firm might be good. Or bitlendingclub. 
You could also just seem a job in the credit or investment industry and use the income to finance activity in the bitcoin economy (buying, selling, investing). The most important thing for bitcoin is liquidity, so if you buy and sell things for bitcoin that's great even if you're day job is unrelated.
Lastly you could just apply to every tech/finance job you see, but tell each of them that the first salary you require is 15% higher than the bitcoin salary you require.

By the definition in the revised reg, the dollars in your bank account will qualify as virtual currency:


digitally stored value. Virtual Currency shall be broadly construed to include digital units of exchange that (i)
have a centralized repository or administrator; (ii) are decentralized and have no centralized repository or
administrator; or (iii) may be created or obtained by computing or manufacturing effort.
Thus any financial institution that engages in any of the following : 


transaction is undertaken for non-financial purposes and does not involve the transfer of more than a nominal
amount of Virtual Currency;
(2) storing, holding, or maintaining custody or control of Virtual Currency on behalf of others;
(3) buying and selling Virtual Currency as a customer business;
(4) performing Exchange Services as a customer business; or
(5) controlling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency.

cool, I see now.
it seems like based on the current structure there is an arbitrage opportunity when the dollar price of bitcoin rises - each ticket still only costs $1 but the jackpot will be relatively larger since earlier tickets were purchased at unfavorable exchange rates.
edit: also, could you explain the "rollover" and "jackpot" part a little better? I'm not sure I understand how the funds are contributed to payouts. If part of ticket sales fund the current pot and part fund a future pot, it seems like players would have incentive to buy tickets up to, but not beyond, the amount purchased in the previous round.

Two reasons:
Today if I wanted to send someone bitcoin as compensation for something (say, paying a friend back for dinner) there's only a 30% chance they would know of anywhere to spend it. If amazon accepted bitcoin, 99% of tech saavy Americans would have at least 1 place to spend it. That will be a large tipping point since most people will no longer have serious reservations about accepting bitcoin related to spendability.
2ndly, it would become a standard for the internet, since enough big players would have adopted. This increases the first point.
@_date: 2015-02-13 03:20:11
You could easily understand why paper notes would be superior to gold (ease of storage, measurement, transfer, etc.) so the question will  be: why did governments choose to devalue paper money by printing more than could be backed by gold, ultimately leading to complete separation from gold backing?
The answer is that government officials frequently believe that the funds confiscated from the people are more efficiently spent by themselves than by the citizens. This could be attributed to malice (greeedy politicians!) or simply that politicians, like most people, believe they understand which ends are the most important for the world and are trying to achieve them.
A good example is war. A politician might believe that citizens will be unwilling to voluntarily fund the war effort against Nazi germany, but the government can use the power of inflation to confiscate value from citizens to spend on the war effort. It's easy to understand (right or wrong) how a government official might think his choice to spend the people's money on the war effort is more valid than citizens' preference to retain their money.

In 2008 there was a sharp reduction in the supply of credit which increased the demand for money and caused nominal prices to fall dramatically across asset classes.
The fed's response to the crisis was to increase the money supply.
It's likely that if the same thing happened, nominal price of bitcoin would fall in the short term. However, the fed's inevitable response of printing money would set bitcoin up for future price growth.
The kind of crisis in which bitcoin would actually do MUCH better would be an inflationary crisis. If the fed continues to print money and we don't have a 2008 style crash, it's likely that inflation will begin to rise.

If you video chat me and verify your identity I will lend you 0.110528 if you agree to purchase btc and repay me 0.12 once your account is set up on circle or coinbase (so within 1 week).
PM me if you'd like to accept.

Thanks for this info. Very interesting.
Would this imply that it's possible that bitcoin would be upheld as a currency in court and gains on bitcoin transactions would fall under the taxpayer relief act of 1997, meaning they would not be taxable under a certain threshold?

Unsecured lending is a large and legitimate market. It will be up to you if you think the risk reward of lending money to the borrowers on a site are worth it. Check out bitlendingclub too. Similar site but Dutch auction style funding
