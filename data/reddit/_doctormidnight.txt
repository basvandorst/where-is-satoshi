Homeboy was willing to exchange $2,600 for a stuffed Rastafarian Banana.  
Does that mean stuffed Rasta Bananas are worth $2,600?

They're free to take delivery of because they're NOTHING.  It's a little bit harder to take delivery of SOMETHING (like physical gold, silver, corn, wheat, oil, etc etc etc) vs. taking delivery of NOTHING.

Who cares if no one cares.  If Nasdaq made a proprietary chain, they wouldn't want anybody to care except for those who'll actually use it -- currently about 70 companies.  You say nobody cares about those other blockchains -- maybe you haven't noticed but there are almost half a billion dollars in those other blockchains so obviously somebody cares.  If an altchain that nobody cares about is capable of securing $225 million, an altchain that nobody cares about is capable of working for Nasdaq's purposes too.

Why would it have to be MORE secure?  
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:04:00
You obviously don't understand what I mean by private ledger.  It can be private but still distributed with consensus.  You don't need the whole world's consensus  (or the whole bitcoin network's), you only need consensus among those that use the network -- 70 companies right now.   
Nothing else you said is worth addressing, you haven't put a dent in any of my arguments whatsoever.

LOL absolute, explicit enforcement??  Like...   so you and I create a smart contract for studio time... You pay me the money but I refuse to let you into the studio...
The contract is enforced by teh maths?  What, is 2+2 going to show up at my door and strong-arm my ass into letting you into the studio?
Quit fooling yourself, the blockchain can't enforce shit.  If a human being says, "fuck you I'm not honoring the contract" there isn't jack shit the blockchain can do about it.

Everybody's so quick to say, "but it's on the Open Assets Protocol so it IS bitcoin!"  but nobody has mentioned that it's a pilot, an experiment, a proof of concept, not a production implementation.  They very well COULD be planning on doing this on another chain, and bitcoiners very well COULD be getting ahead of themselves.  
@_date: 2015-05-15 18:34:12
No, a peer-to-peer, distributed ledger that enforces *decentralized consensus* among banks is a lot more than a database.  It protects banks from each other just like the bitcoin blockchain protects you people from each other.  
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:04:34
Hey thank you for the invite.  I might just take you up on that.  There have been times that I've wished I had a platform to make a point about bitcoin, knowing full well that isn't open-minded enough to give me the time of day.  I have my doubts about whether a voice like mine would get anything but hate even on a more "tolerant" bitcoin blog like yours (not because of you of course) but I definitely do have thoughts &amp; opinions that I feel very strongly about;  I'm not a great writer but I can probably formulate an idea well enough... maybe I'll give it a shot. 
Thanks again for the invitation. :)

Topic is smart contracts, that's correct.  Smart contracts can't help here, remember? I'm still on topic, what happened to you?  Do you need me to draw you some pictures instead?

I've had comments deleted and accounts banned for making these kinds of points in this sub.  These people don't want rational alternative viewpoints, they want to hear the echoes of their own bullshit.  Check my history, look at some of the arguments I've had with these guys.  It's ridiculous.

Here's another fact for you:  The price fell on that volume.

These are really stupid questions.   


Uh.... by maintaining distributed consensus of a transaction ledger.  


Uh.... protection against double-spends, protection against counterfeit, protection against fraud


Who gets to participate in ANY peer-to-peer network?  Do YOU get to participate in IBM's peer-to-peer networks?  Or do IBM's partners get to participate?  It's a very dumb question with a very obvious answer.

The ledger still has to agree with the real world.  If it says Bob owns a farm but jim and his milita are currently living on said farm... good luck with that.  People have been known to say, "take your receipt/contract/ledger and shove it up your ass" at which point your record keeping practices become a little more complicated.  
As they say, possession is 9/10ths of the law.

I'm going to go buy some nickels for a dime each - I'm hoping to sell them for 15 cents a piece.  
@_date: 2015-05-09 00:43:45
I was exaggerating a bit, but I do in fact save nickels for this exact reason.  I sort and save pennies too, because the same situation is happening with copper.  It happened a long time ago with silver; moore's law has made it so that there isn't much silver left to be found in the wild... but yep, that's what happened with silver.  Silver dimes are worth over a dollar, quarters almost $3, halves $6 and dollars almost $13.  All coins that can be found in circulation because they're still legal tender -- I have over 300 ounces of silver in "junk" coins. 
I was looking for a way to turn $.01 into $.02... I figured once I found out how, I'd just do it over &amp; over again until I was rich.  Well, it turns out that some pennies are actually worth $.02, but they can be had for $.01.  If you look on eBay, there are people who are totally willing to pay over face-value for copper pennies, right now today.  
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:10:16
My general rule of thumb for penny stocks (which is, don't kid yourself, what GBTC really is) is to not touch anything with less than 100k volume; I like knowing I can sell something after I buy it.  At 13.5k...  good luck flipping if/when you find yourself in the money.

Who backs gold is a dumb question.  That's like saying gasoline doesn't have value because there is nothing backing it.  Gasoline has value because it's gasoline -- it's useful for a lot of things.  Gold doesn't need anything backing it because it's gold -- one of the most useful metals on earth.

I guess you might not, too.  
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:56:42
So if it's an identical setup it's just as useful to a company like Nasdaq.  They don't need bitcoin, OR bitcoin's blockchain -- for them to say "we like blockchain tech but not bitcoin" isn't the face-palming cringe-worthy statement you guys are making it out to be.   Blockchain without bitcoin isn't only possible, it's already been done many times.  Thanks.  
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:11:38
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:21:17
WHY would they??? Seriously?  How about, because they don't want to have to keep up with the price of bitcoin.  Or how about because they don't need a public ledger but a private one shared amongst a few, not millions. Or how about because they need block reward tokens to represent something other than money, like a privelege or status.  I can think of a million reasons why someone would want a separate blockchain.  
@_date: 2015-05-14 04:49:27


YOUR fallacy is thinking that I believe that.  Nobody said it would be MORE secure.  It would be *sufficiently* secure, however, and that's all that matters.   There are no third parties, it's a peer to peer network just like any other blockchain.  
@_date: 2015-05-13 02:20:02
You're assuming that whoever makes the alt coin *needs* adoption or traction.  In Nasdaq's case, for example, they currently have about 70 companies that trade stock off-exchange.  You don't need any more traction than those 70 companies -- give each one an ASIC and let them be miners; the block reward doesn't have to be money, it could be a token that allows you the privilege of transacting on this private network.  Who cares if people don't want to participate in it -- it's not for people anyway, you wouldn't *want* people to participate -- it's for a small network of companies.  If they're all on board, that's all that's needed.

The word "peer" in "peer-to-peer network" hasn't morphed, stupid.  It means the same thing it always has.  Context hasn't changed either, we're still talking about peer-to-peer networks implemented among banks to leverage blockchain technology for the purpose of maintaining consensus via a distributed ledger.  
@_date: 2015-05-14 00:58:18
So mad!  
OK great.  So we've established that smart contracts can't help in this situation (because they can't enforce shit).  I wonder why so many people in this sub think smart contracts are going to eliminate lawyers and judges?  I see that assertion on the front page of all the time.  Maybe they tried on a pair of the big boy pants before they were ready.  
@_date: 2015-05-12 20:47:59
The payment/incentive could be simply getting your message onto the blockchain, or it could be a token that allows you to transact on this particular network.  Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-05-15 18:24:13
And what happens if they need the tokens to represent something other than money, like a privelege or a status? What if the tokens having value to other people is a bad thing?
If the bitcoin blockchain is the only secure blockchain, then how are ripple or litecoin maintaining their market caps?
edit:  lol nobody's going near this one.

GEEZUS are you people serious???  Please read a fucking book.  
A peer in the "meaningful context" of this conversation means a bank with a presence on the network.  
@_date: 2015-05-15 22:12:35


lol wut?  
Yes there is.  Literally every single node on the network is a blockchain server.  
That's kinda how peer-to-peer networks function.
