Password is different with PIN. PIN is used for entering the App, but the password is used for encrypting the private keys.
Without password, nobody can get the private keys.
If Mycelium can reset "xxx" (PIN/password) for you, that means the private keys are stored in plain format, so they donot need to decrypt your keys.
We may considering the encrypting policies in future release, and maybe provide the unecrypt options for users.
Thanks for your advice. We may keep working in improving Bither as possible as we can.

It is a "hiden" function. You should click on the Bitcoin Symbol in the circle panel upon the version info "Bither Hot 1.3.7"

If you click the Bitcoin symbol on setting page, you may find the "network monitoring" function. There you can see the syncing status (Local block height and Peer's block height), also you can take a look at the peers you connected.
Can you see wether it is ok on peers' connectoin and block syncing?

Syncing may need long time if there are many blocks to catch up.
And Syncing has nothing to do with the password.
