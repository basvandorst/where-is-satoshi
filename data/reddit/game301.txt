No, thankfully I am not affected by that particular affliction. Are you incapable of having a mature conversation about freedom of access and free speech? Serious question. Quit acting like an ass and take a deep breath and one moment to think before you type your next response.
Here is some useful literature on the subject:
(By the way, I google searched "unbiased explanation Net Neutrality" for the included information.)

You haven't answered my question. What have you got to complain about? What do you think private companies will do to protect you? The answer is nothing. Use your brain please.....

You mean *exactly* the way the internet has run for the past 2 years? What haven't you liked? What do you expect private companies to do in order to change this?

With so many posts like this... 
Why don't you guys position trade? If you're willing to put money into crypto you should be willing to put some time in it and should know when to sell and when to buy. Holding is all about gaining coin. If you're losing coin by holding during a dip.... why are you still holding?

I agree. This graph is completely speculative. A prediction of something we *may* see happen.

I think you're missing the point. Nobody should be bragging about taking miniscule fees on something that makes money for them. It's not a service for trade, it's a cute little gambling game. I simply see no need to brag about "taking small fees" in this situation.

Fees on a game designed to aggregate Satoshi for the creator? I wouldn't expect fees. I'm already gambling.

That sounds fine. Then why brag about network operation costs being low? Aren't they assumed to be? At this point, I'm just piquing my curiosity.

This screenshot marks the first months I was introduced to BTC and the value at that time, in perspective to where we are today. Just thought it was a funny little memory that others could relate to.
