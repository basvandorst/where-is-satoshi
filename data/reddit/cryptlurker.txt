Sounds like time to upgrade your safe, and encrypt a paper wallet.

Don't worry, I don't. All this article does is highlight the importance off getting your coins out of an exchange.

Considering the media's inability to spot the housing bubble before it popped, I seriously doubt they have any idea wtf they're talking about.

So, about those $25 fees? Anybody care about these? Anybody willing to acknowledge the problem here?

@_date: 2017-12-19 19:39:58
Well, they are super duper high. Are people really expected to just ignore these fees? Seems to me that people will just start using an altcoin with lower fees.. which appears to be happening.

[a persistent, substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money and **resulting in the loss of value of currency**](
This is not happening with Bitcoin, instead we see the value of the currency increasing despite the increase in volume of coins in circulation. This is called *deflation*, not inflation.

Fiat $ is NOT backed by anything, especially gold.

Ok, neat. Now try to buy a t-shirt with bitcoin and tell me how much that costs in fees.

Sounds nice, until you end up paying $18 in fees for a $17 "coin"

Just bite the bullet and buy. The first buy is always the hardest.

Attack? Bullshit. The fees are too damn high. $25/transaction is unacceptable.
