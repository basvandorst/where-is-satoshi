Hey, you dropped this...
Thank you!

Who is paying CGT on their cryptocurrency gains?
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:45:46
This is how you do it. I used Bittrex instead of Coinomi though.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:52:18
Not everyone who disagrees with you is malicious or stupid.

Consider this option? BIP38 encrypted paper wallets stored as an encrypted PDF on the cloud. When you get internet access on the other side, sweep keys as you need them.

Go ahead and tell them to buy if you think that it's a good idea. You didn't force them. They're responsible for their own actions. Caveat emptor.

Damn it. I thought that this didn't post so I mashed the Add Comment button.

...at this price.

I agree with you. That's why I think that it's probably okay to buy wherever you like but trade for fiat using Localbitcoins or some other cash arrangement as a precaution.

I mean, I could delete the duplications but then there'd still be a string of deleted posts shown. Is there a better way?

People talk about how to pay CGT on their crypto gains and I'm like O.o
I came to crypto for a took to help throw off the yolk imposed by govt and their bankster buddies.
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:49:00
The logarithmic chart makes it seem plausible.
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:43:50
This is how you do it. I used Bittrex instead on Coinomi though.
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:42:03
Would it be so hard to launder it? Why just hand money to the govt if you don't have to?
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:12:33
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:03:57
Can you elaborate a little on how you got to your conclusion?
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:25:19
Fell out of favor? How hard did he fall?
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:29:07
Bullshit. Price levels feel by about 50% in the USA from 1800 to 1900 and gold-backed currency kept on getting spent. The economy grew substantially during this time too.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:20:23
You're right!

Every payment you make in bitcoin "advertises" that you don't value bitcoin highly. You show others that you prefer to trade out of bitcoin for something else. The thing that benefits my investment is the prevalence of hoarders. As they withhold bitcoin from the market, the price rises. As it does, more people aspire to hold bitcoin. And so the cycle continues.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:16:25
I want more bitcoin hoarders.

You don't need to quote me. My earlier comment is shown right above yours. The age of a Reddit account is a crude heuristic. I wouldn't give it much weight.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:17:00
Exactly. This is my strategy.

Maybe he creates a new account regularly. I do.

The IRS doesn't deserve a slice of our crypto gains. I'm not giving them a cut. You don't need to either. Don't let your fear own you.
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:37:00
Returns may be high enough to justify investment.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:12:15
It's cheaper to hold the bitcoin and just spend cash. That's what I do and my finances are better for it. You should do it too. Daniel Krawisc made a [compelling case for hoarding bitcoin]( a few years ago.

Great website! These guys are awesome. I wish that their articles were more frequent. There's a lot of good reading there for newcomers though.
