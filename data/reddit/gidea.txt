Isn't litecoin a fork of bitcoin? :D He kinda shoots hiumself int he foot with that last statement :)) 
And yeah, calling your shit "lite" just because you knew it will be less valuable than the original doesn't make for a valid coin imho. granted, Charlie has been a nice guy, but this was a bit funny tbh...

After all these comments still no clear answer :)) use location or GMT standard if possible :D

Coinbase has the best shot at doing this. And it's backed by a visionary who can handle the pressure and argue why this is the future.
Plus, Braintree is showing European payment providers what they should be doing right now. Braintree has some interesting clients ;)

I see this as great news as well (ofc) and I hope angel investors will see VC's playing hard and they will probably trust the bitcoin entrepreneurs a bit more. fingers crossed ;)
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:59:33
That's all we have for now. Will update when more details surface ;)

Will you change your blog to unsuccessfuldropout now? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:50:11
Depends on the exchange as far as I understand. For example Bitstamp has halted bitcoin withdraws 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:41:28
just watchin'... waiting... thinking of, you know...
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:28:34
i agree, but the perspective changes if we factor in that we could buy coins even cheaper IF there will be a price correction. I dunno if I should increase my savings and wait for the dip, or climb to the top by firmly buying "cheapest coins of the day". I guess there is no real answer, but I am curious to see what other think of a price correction. It all comes down to the stomach of the new users I guess

That moment when u read this comment in 2030 and still wish you bought at 3300 :))
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:58:12
if I buy now from bitstamp can i transfer in time? 1hour 20min remaining..
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:29:27
btw, good people keep r/bitcoin on "new" ;)

This will he the only vacation you take and become richer by the time you get back! :D remember to be kind and maybe share your good luck in the local economy

It’s Bizzaro World :))

Might be a good idea to resurface that post, more homes have ASICs now, maybe it’s not that crazy anymore...

If people can buy the dip on Coinbase with their credit card, it might be part of the reason, I imagine other exchanges need a few days for deposits.
Also volume includes people selling btc, maybe because they get scared. Coinbase has lots of newbies in this game, and more experienced users might be better hodlers. 
And then on the Bitfinex side there might be other reasons for lower trading volume. There are lots of complex factors ... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:59:14
I’m waiting to see what happens monday, and what news starts echoing out on mainstream media. The effects might be much re serious, plus december coming soon. We’re back to a high volatility, compared to the growth in the past weeks. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:42:34
The majority of people have a short attention span. It might takes years for them to really understand why they need decentralized financial tools. Some of us get it now, but we’re a small minority of tech savvy people. Most other shitcoins are growing and are perceived as valuable just because of this short attention span. Russia’s crypto ruble will do great, until it doesn’t. And then they’ll be back :) maybe not to bitcoin, as we still dunno what the future holds, but at least they’ll be back to the core values of crypto currencies
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:26:02
Maybe this actually prevents a shit ton of panic selling. But it is annoying if you wanna buy... and support is mostly automatic, unresponsive and slow as fuck
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:24:20
For these reasons I partially moved to bitstamp, especially because they now have a neat trading view and credit card Deposits via Simplex. I keep some in coinbase and will move the rest to a hardware wallet. Coinbase is looking to secure, or has secured more funding, startup-style, they might still fuck up big time for any number of reasons...

The transaction fee for 500eur was around 40euro, but still better than SEPA payments (which costs me 25euro)
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:09:00
I bought at $2270 another 0.2BTC for short term trading, I also recovered my whole initial investment back in fiat and saved some coins for my retirement :D now I have a small pool of money I can loose without regret and play the game, while keep investing spare change

Search facebook for the group "Nordic Blockchain Association" and join the group, there will be some events and meetups, tonight there's a cryptobar event f.ex. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:30:43
Hey mate, another expat  living in Denmark here :)
Buy with Coinify - they only do KYC verifications and they are danish, so payments are smooth
Join the Nordic Blockchain Associations, we are waiting for some hardware wallets for july (ledger nano s)
I use bitstamp, and the verification process was fine. Coinbase has verified my identity, but is still limiting me to 500euro buy/sell. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:16:15
Yes, I started 2 years ago and still learning, i dunno why I felt to say anything in the first place, ego most likely
I've been here since GPU's were flying off the shelves and people could still mine some coins, when MtGox stiffed everyone, when bitstamp seemed to good to be true in europe and they are still doing well, when Canada was getting schooled by Antonopolus (i never have the patience to read his full name properly, sorry).
And the reason for the claim is that the Bitminer event was over, and people were waiting for a good time to join ze party :) but these types of claims might have an effect on it's own, but few people will see a new post from an inactive account, i might even be a coinbase employee because of the other single post I shared. Damn, now I'm not sure either :o
