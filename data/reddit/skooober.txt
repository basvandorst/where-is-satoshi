I see this in their terms, "Any deposit less than 0.1BTC will be considered as a donation to our charity wing."
Did your friend send a transaction that was exactly 0.1BTC without including the miner fee? That would have made the total less than 0.1BTC to their wallet......just trying to think of anything that could have happened. Sucks tho sorry

none you pay for the card first (like 10-20 dollars) and 0 on domestic fees..it's free. You get fee when you use an ATM to withdrawl but basic transactions are free buddy..again..not sure what country you are in so may not be available for you
