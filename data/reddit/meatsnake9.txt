What is the downside of just using GDAX and never putting USD or Crypto into coinbase

I am hoping that this hits major news outlets tomorrow, causing more interest, and probably a lot of new users/buyers. Each milestone helps catapult us

Where can you see what sell orders are out

It is super volatile. Could drop 1000+ tomorrow, Could go up 2000? We can only make slightly educated guesses at the future

Hoping for big news outlets to make this huge tomorrow to keep this train rolling

You can use coinbase to buy, but large sums should be stored in a separate wallet for added security incase something happens with coinbase

As wild as this may seem now, it is defiinitely possible 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:51:54
Depends entirely on the setup/processing power. Could be months or years for the enthusiast with a decent gpu

Even if this "bubble" bursts by 80% I've still made a greater profit than my traditional investments

11,000 to 8,200 to 10,00 in 3 hours. I love volatility
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:52:46
I've never been more excited and optimistic about capital gains
