this was a message I just sent bitstamp
I VERIFIED MY ACCOUNT OVER 4 MONTHS AGO. YOU TELL ME I NEED TO RE-VERIFY. I SEND YOU AN APPROPRIATE DOCUMENT THAT MEETS YOUR CRITERIA, AND YOU JUST DENIED MY VERIFICATION? I'M GETTING REALLY ANGRY HERE.
YOUR DENIAL MESSAGE TOLD ME THE FOLLOWING IN AN EMAIL
Proof of residence document does not meet our verification standards - the document can not be accepted as proof of residence.
Please submit a high quality (300dpi) image of a recent utility bill/bank statement or similar document as described on our verification page. Make sure that your name, address of residency and date of issue are clearly visible. The document must not be older than 3 months from the day of its issue.
NOTE: We are unable to accept electronic bills/statements, online screenshots, mobile phone bills, credit card statements or business card statements."
1. MY PROOF OF RESIDENCE DOCUMENT WAS 600DPI, DOUBLE YOUR REQUIREMENT.
2.MY NAME ADDRESS AND DATE OF BANK STATEMENT ARE CLEARLY VISIBLE
3. MY DOCUMENT IS LESS THAN 1 MONTH OLD.
WHY ARE YOU NOT VERIFYING ME?

WHY ARE YOU NOT VERIFYING ME?

already sent verification 3 times and received same response, all without caps locks. My document meets all their criteria, every time. What would u suggest I do now, instead of "stomping my feet" ???

The following has been my correspondence with Bitstamp; starting with their first message. And FYI, all my documents I submitted to them were and are still valid. Something "goxy" is going on in my opinion.
Anžej Simičak 3 days, 6 hours Dear Eric ,
upon review of your Bitstamp account we have to notify you that your verification documents do not meet our verification standards.
We kindly ask you to resubmit your verification documents in accordance with our verification standards: ~~~~~~~~

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
Best regards, Anžej Simičak Eric Coombs 2 days, 22 hours Anzej,
I have many bitcoins on bitstamp. You're telling me I dont have access to my own money until I resubmit verification to you that you've already accepted? This doesnt sound right, something sounds shady going on here.
Eric Eric Coombs 2 days, 22 hours Can you please enable my account so I may move all of my money from bitstamp, as I dont think I will be using your services anymore.
Thank you.
Eric Benedikt Potisek 9 hours, 13 minutes Dear Eric ,
in order to fully meet our verification standards and in accordance with our KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, we have determined that your documents do not meet our verification standards.
We therefore kindly ask you to submit new documentation (ID and proof of residency) here: ~~~~~~
Best regards, Benedikt Potisek

They dont have a problem with my ID, just my proof of residencey paperwork. I am using the same bank account statement I received in the mail as I did originally; only a more current statement. Have done everything exactly the same as when i was originally "verified" and they are saying its no good. They have not written to me personally with what is wrong, they just keep giving me the same bs that is already posted in text on their website as well as their "how to" video to get verified. Can't really do anything more, they are just not verifying me, and not explaining why. Not really sure they can say anything, maybe thats why they arent :(

Cab000se, you must not of ever been burned in your life for a meaningful amount of money, or you would see the possible severity and potential scale of Bitstamps actions. Others have been having this problem as well. Instead you comment on me writing in caps.
@_date: 2014-04-22 23:52:34
you obviously missed the point of me posting this. oh well.
@_date: 2014-04-23 00:38:55
if he was to correct that grammar, then he would need to correct "do" to "done" 
@_date: 2014-04-23 00:37:31
Well, I can send another bank account statement. Dont have any utility bills in my name. It would be nice for them to tell me specifically what is wrong, so I can fix it. Instead they keep giving me the same copy/paste answer :(

I dont need to goto college, already have a masters degree. But thanks for the critique.
