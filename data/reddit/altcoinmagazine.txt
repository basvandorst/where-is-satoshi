 like the cypherpunks and those who share their ideologies believe, privacy which is “the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world”, is important if open societies are to thrive in the information age.

What are Taxable Events?
It’s likely that all cryptocurrency transactions will be treated as a taxable event; some being treated as income and others being treated as a capital gain or loss.
This can include:
Trading Cryptocurrency: Buying and selling cryptocurrency can generate a capital gain or loss. Fortunately, losses can be used to offset gains.
Coin/Token Exchanges: Exchanging between cryptocurrencies. For example, purchasing Ripple for Bitcoin would be considered a taxable event.
Selling Bitcoin for Fiat: When converting cryptocurrency back into fiat (USD or other sovereign currency) this is treated as a taxable event generating a capital gain/loss.
Receiving Cryptocurrency (as a payment): If a cryptocurrency is received in exchange for a product or service or a salary/wage (it is treated as ordinary income) the value of the transaction is calculated at the fair market at the time of receipt.
Air drops: Treated as ordinary income based on the value of cryptocurrency on the day of the airdrop. Also, at time of exchange there will be a capital gain taxable event.
Exchanging Bitcoin for something of value: This is a taxable event and may generate a capital gain or loss.
Cryptocurrency Mining: Mining is considered ordinary income (determined by the fair market value on the day the coin/token was mined)
