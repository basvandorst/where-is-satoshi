Off topic but.... I like Star Wars as much as the next guy but every time I see an article about something Mark Hamill said I can’t help but hear pandering. Why do people care what he has to say that much? Do people think he’s some sort of visionary?

Minors do have to pay taxes. Where did you get that idea?

Incorrect. Miners overloading the network to artificially inflate fees is not the same as miners intentionally incorrectly solving the problems in order to rewrite transaction history, and the white paper doesn’t refer to any such action. In fact, ‘miners’ in the white paper refers specifically to the client nodes, while ‘miners’ in this post refers to the individuals operating those nodes. 
With that said, you’re correct in a sense - bitcoin won’t work if miners (node operators) act in the manner described by OP, because network fees will continue to rise to the point that no one will use bitcoin anymore. But that’s not what you’re claiming. What you call “bitcoin working” is not the same as what the white paper means by “bitcoin will work as long as more than half of the miners (client nodes) are honest”

Yep. Thinking about buying more if it makes it down to 10k

Yep. Always a mistake :(

That’s not relevant at all. That essentially refers to a collection of nodes attempting to “rewrite the blockchain”.

How old of a lambo are you willing to consider? Does it have to run?

That's why he used a regular bank.

The fact that this account name hadn't existed until now despite all the hate Gox and Karpeles get is astounding. Bravo to you, good sir, for the rest of our stupidity.

Nice job tossing attacks at people who haven’t said anything rude at all
Glad to have people like you in the world

Thank you, captain obvious

No, because she's not a "real judge" in the same way that judges in actual courtrooms are. She's a mediator and the two conflicted parties sign a contract agreeing to carry out whatever she decides at the end of the day, but her decisions only carry legal weight because of the contract. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:49:22
With that attitude she will
@_date: 2013-04-25 03:06:49
Sounds great!
