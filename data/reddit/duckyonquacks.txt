That's awesome. Looks amazing going to give it a try . Thanks

It seems cool, I like cs go so I'll give it a shot. I like the idea anyway. The whole unknown(to me) coin they use is the only thing.  I take it you don't bet on matches ? Just win small amounts ?
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:36:25
I'm pretty sure it's not

Yea, I read your post the other day and was impressed seeing this video follow-up much props to you. It was motivational.  
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:34:15
Nope,havnt tried that

Thanks, considering all the neagtivity and news recently as i decide to invest i feel like its validating my timing to do it is pretty good. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:14:17
You are completely right. But i am not so conflicted as i am broke.  
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:45:03
Hard to , but I'm thinking somewhere between 8 and 12 
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:15:30
I blame the news articles that made it sound like it was down " by" 80% in there wording recently

It is not spinning. When I plug in it makes a beeping noise about very half a second. It attempts to start spinning and stops

Will do, I uploaded a pic of it. I was considering a video but I don't want to risk hurting it more by plugging it back in
PS Thanks for you informative response and suggestions it's a big help

Yea, but I used that for everything at that time... lol tbh the idea of someone recovering going through those files tho...There's probably some embarrasing shit on there tbh..i was young .  Partially the reason I've been blocking out the actual amount of money we are talking about and not had thoughts of getting it repaired despite being in a bad place financially.. oh I'm sure there's nothing to bad but like. Eh I'm usually a pretty socially anxious person so it bothers me
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:25:23
I just updated with pictures as you posted this

Yea basically.  Profit realized for the amount transferred? Does that affect the year timeframe of the other bit coin in the codebase "wallet".. I find it somewhat confusing. Specially considering I havnt bought in a lump sum in the first place and slowly buy more on a  monthly basis.

Tons of courses on udemy,  or a premium bootcamp , art assets, music, sound affects all of it would be great. My hobby is indy game dev. Been at it for 3 years now yet to release anything but working on it.  It's hard and alot of hours of learning and grinding  but rewarding. Having some premium assets and stuff would be encouraging to actualy release something.

Well , everyone wanted this chance and wished for movement again. Now they are right back in here selling off low and not even considering buying in.. It's funny. Sheep will be sheep I guess.

What's wrong with coinbase. Without coinbase A lot of people that are beginners and not technically savvy would never have been able to get into crypto or bitcoin in the first place.  
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:13:56
I read ths as "Take my bitcoin !" and got all excited . Poor goggles are a bitch.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:52:10
Oh, thanks for letting me know that I was not aware you could do that with them.  I might grab one asap then 
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:31:41
Good idea , I never thought of this. I'll check it out.
