And I just got this auto-reply email from them I sent:
MU has had to urgently discontinue it's services after a series of
attacks on our system. Also, new United States regulations prevent us
from continuing our services. In order to comply with new FiCEN /
Homeland Security regulations, MU has been shut down.
MU is not the only service that has been impacted by the new federal
(Among others)

Fuck these fuckers.  Here is what their website says now:
"MU is no longer available and has shut down to comply with new U.S Regulations regarding the use of BitCoin in the United States. MU is not immune to these regulations and will 100% comply."
They are using the recent Mt.Gox thing to justify their exit and then they link you to their TOS:
"MINING UNITED RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL ANY / OR ALL TRANSACTIONS AT ANYTIME, FOR ANY REASON WITH NO BITCOIN OR OTHER TYPE REFUND. ANY BITCOIN(S) SENT TO ANY 'BITCOIN ADDRESSES' ON THIS WEBSITE HAVE A ZERO MONETARY VALUE ($USD OR OTHER) ONCE RECEIVED. MINING UNITED IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FINANCIAL LOSS RESULTING FROM USE. WITH ALL 'INVESTMENTS' THERE IS ASSUMED RISK."

Oh well, only out 0.25.  Not too bad.  I did make some change while it lasted, about .05.

Hold your breath.  I have a private wallet, yet they claim they won't pay to US wallets... Think about that.  It was a scam and we all fell for it.
