Maybe we can just be fashionably late

Thanks for the tips! I forget about the sidebars because I only use Alien Blue to get on Reddit on my iPhone. 
Someone suggested Bitfloor so that's what I downloaded last night. Am I crazy or are most of these sites multipurpose? It seems like you can store/deposit/withdraw from all of them. I guess I don't understand why someone would suggest Bitfloor as a wallet and Coinbase to buy? 
Why not use Mt Gox for it all?

Correct me if I'm wrong but I won't have a private key until I purchase some bitcoin right? 
Also there's no way to encrypt my wallet if I use the same one you have, right? How do you go about backing it up? By just printing out your private keys?
Sorry for all the questions. If there's a FAQ somewhere please direct me to it!

Reading now. Lots of good info! So are these sites actually how you gain the most versus having your computer do the work? I'm still kinda confused on all that.

Now I can't wait to get home and get to my laptop! Stuck here at work for a few more hours...
Thanks for the info!

It does! 
Such a different way of thinking about financial dealings!
Thank you!

Ok so looked at both of these sites last night and maybe it's because I was in a rush because the kids were awake but wth? Is there no easy way to just buy some? I have to go deposit money with Bank of America somehow or some other crazy way?

Is there a Bitcoins for Dummies book yet?
Seriously...I can't for the life of me figure all this out. I can't find a private key for my local wallet. I can't figure out encryption on the wallet. I can't even figure out how to buy any bitcoins!

Ditto for me! I have a local wallet but I'm so confused by all the different sites for buying/selling and everything else!
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:51:48
So you're saying if I sign up and buy some today, I have to wait in line behind those 20k people? I'm also waiting to get "verified"?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:22:44
In your opinion, what percentage of the world even knows what bitcoins are? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:19:47
So glad I didn't figure out how to buy last night!

Do you have any suggestions on a wallet? Is local really better?

I'd better get my wallet set up tonight then! 
How do you actually turn it into real money tho? You just sell them kinda like stocks?
