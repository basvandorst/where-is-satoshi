Two thoughts:
1- You speak of your "watch-only wallet receive address" - singular. But, electrum lets you generate multiple receiving addresses in your watch-only wallet. Why not generate a new receive address for each transaction?
2- Consider making a test transaction from your cold wallet, to assure yourself that this works.

"...that is why its history is blank...". Correct!

Probably you were already planning this, but just in case: restore the wallet on the new phone before deleting the app on the old phone!

Tails no longer comes with a current version of Electrum, so you won't be able to connect to servers with it. But! Tails with its old version of Electrum is still fine for offline signing .

Offline tails for wallet creation is good. You can create a "watching only" wallet at the same time, which lets you generate receive addresses without exposing your private keys. Also you can watch your balance.

I don't disagree with you, but I was asking the OP. I haven't seen a clear statement about why "doing nothing" has been ruled out, given the OP's perception, "every move is risky"

I see what you're saying. I think you're reading the arrow as "implies", while I (and the author, I guess) are thinking "because". Words stand out more for me than graphics, maybe.

It is possible to have redundancy with a trezor (I have no experience with ledger). When you set up your a new trezor, you generate a list of words - the recovery seed. With those words, you can restore your wallet into a new trezor device. You never see the actual private key; that's locked inside the trezor.
In this scenario, you have your trezor, which can be protected with a PIN, and you have your recovery seed, which anyone can use to restore your wallet into another trezor. You do need a way to save pieces of paper safely. Given that, I question the value of trezor over just using an offline-generated electrum wallet, with \_its\_ recovery seed saved somewhere, and an online watching wallet.

Here's my summary, based on a quote from the first paragraph: " In this article we will provide a solution to one of bitcoins biggest problem: **lost BTCs."**

Why do anything? What problem are you trying to solve?
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:05:36
Above, you didn't reject the idea of multiple trezor or ledger hardware wallets. Compare that to multiple paper wallets (or multiple pieces of paper containing a recovery seed) - what about that strikes you as less safe?

With enough money in the scenario to build a house, I suggest you use a tiny fraction of it to get some tax advice from a professional. 
My opinion, free of charge: if it's too much work to come up with an exact cost basis, then create an underestimate. Try to make a solid case that you're paying \_at least\_ as much tax as you owe. Save your work, you'll want it if you get audited.

Can you say more about step 4, "set attributes to read-only"? That's missing from my standard procedure, and I'd like to understand the motivation for it.

I take it back: 29x29 is optimal. My mistake was to assume alphanumeric encoding includes upper- and lower-case letters; turns out it's upper-case only.

Cool project. You could fit an address in a 25x25 QR code, which would save a bit of work. Ref: [

You can save your signed transaction to a usb thumb drive. You'll need to enable the non-default admin password option, so you can mount the drive. [

Or, for the price of a thumb drive, you can do this with Tails

At the moment, Tails ships with a down-rev, unusable version of Electrum. You can install the latest Electrum in Tails; see the tails subreddit for details. Just mentioning this because the "convenience" part of the story is lacking right now.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:22:30
Oh, good point, the down-rev Electrum should work for offline signing. So it's convenient enough for that purpose!
