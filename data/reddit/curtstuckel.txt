I went and asked in their telegram, they said its a heavily customized android system. The chipset is Allwinner A64 which has no radio components in nature.

You can trust Trezor to create your private key because it is open-sourced or you use the Ellipal because it lets you import your private keys. 
But I do agree with you, many mistakes in crypto are due to user error. If everyone is very careful and responsible, there wouldn't be solutions like hardware wallets. Nonetheless, with hardware wallets, user error still occurs.

You still need to type it in but you'll have a touch screen to type on at least.

That's why hardware wallets are useful. Anyways I'm sure there are ways to permanently disable the Wifi autoconnect for the android.

Anything on paper shouldn't be good long term solution. I literally know people who accidentally destroyed the paper. Anyway, you can create your BIP39 code from a trusted source and import it to more physical cold storage like Ellipal wallet when your investment grows, its one of the few that can do import.

You can always create your own private keys with open-source software that you trust (Be aware open-source can also mean a bad counterfeit can be made to trick you). For me, I use the Ellipal Titan cold wallet to hold my private keys because it can import private keys. Although their code is not open source and I have no reason to trust it, I have no problem using it because all the private keys are my own. 
So if a wallet you're using isn't certified or you don't trust it, just import from a source you trust. Hope that makes sense.

It got a little camera on the backside. You use it with their App so everything happens through scanning QR codes between the two. Pretty fun and easy to use if you ask me. My fav part is that it's all metal, very high quality built.

Hey, I'm not saying its better or worst. It's just another storage solution and I want to give it a try. So far, I like it alot and it seems pretty secure.

It's not like bitfi, private keys are created and stored inside like the other wallets. For me, I imported my own into the wallet.

haha yes, it's QR code based.

Ellipal cold wallet having 25% off bundles over at their shop  [

Structure and security model wise, it is good. However, it is not open source and the company is still young. I rely on importing my own private keys rather than generating inside the wallet.
however, a good thing about a young company is that they are quick on the support questions. I have been asking them often and learning a lot more.

For one, I can't see any USB ports and the screen is sealed strongly on the metal body. If it can't be connected to another device, can it still be hacked, even if I imported my own keys?

Only played around with it, can't say for sure yet but loving it so far.

So it cannot be a word? Regardless of length, do random letters and numbers give better security?

Assuming only the wallet is stolen
Use hardware wallets with self destruct feature or one that allows you to recover immediately on a hot wallet. There is the Ellipal and a few others that can self destruct.

Yes, Sonny's goal and a big Mourinho win definitely get everyone to come see the extended highlights.

I have an Ellipal wallet and it can self destruct when someone tries to crack open the hardware. Doesn't this ultimately protect me against all physical attacks similar to this?
