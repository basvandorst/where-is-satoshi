And what about deflationary Stocks? Maybe we should ban stocks, they cause people to not spend their money as they expect their stocks to grown in value. Why spend when you can grow your money on stocks?

Bitcoin have lots of highly skilled developers working on various parts of it. Doge is a copy of bitcoin, which is messed up by amateurs who really did not understand what they did when they changed some parameters, one parameter they changed was that there will be no limit on the amount of Doge coins produced, this was an accident that they decided to keep.
 
Unlike Bitcoin, this means that there has to be an endless supply of new users in order for it to keep its value any long term. 
There is no skilled developers behind it. 
There are no investors or companies who support it.
The network strenght of Doge coin is so small its hardly there compared to bitcoin which also means its easy to attack.
In short, its sort of a joke in a comical package compared to Bitcoin.
But they do one thing right, they sell the package very good to people who can tell the differences and who think they are early adopters of this super currency that will go to the moon.
Ofcourse things can change and Doge is still better than fiat.

Op´s right, some tipping will create interest. Its a great way of spreading the gospel.
First people will get happy. 
You do not get angry for being tipped. People who claim that here are either working against bitcoin as shills here or simply lying.
It will generate intererst and visibility and people will tell their friends about it. Hey I got tipped a bitcoin today. 
It might also get people kickstarted into downloading a wallet and learning more about bitcoin. Trying to get that bitcoin into a wallet.
If you want your coins to increase in value start tipping.

Anyone can make a new soda that tastes like Cola, anyone can pay young people to make Hamburgers, anyone can make a new ketchup. Those are all really easily replicated and thus just mirages. 
But he misses that he can not replicate all the various developers working on bitcoin, he can not replicate being the worlds first opensource decentralized currency. I would like to see him replicate that.

Don´t trust the banks. Use a bip38 paperwallet. A paperwallet protected by a password. Never store more than a very few at home.

To be fair, bitcoin is the most successful cryptocurrency ever.
