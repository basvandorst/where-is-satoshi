You talk about this as a speedbump, as an investment. You know what the key is for investments? Don't invest more than you can lose.
And that's all good. But the problem is that people are also trying to see Bitcoin as a currency. You lose value in all your investments that are denominated in that currency. And this could even include *your paycheck*.
This is a huge problem for a currency. For a speculative investment, as Bitcoin really is in most ways despite the way people make it out to be, it's not as big a deal.

We can't make money by holding your butts for the float as they go up in value anymore so we're going to have to charge you a fee. Like any normal operator. SFYL. Please don't go over to Square/VISA, okay?

There were faster modems available years before.
The USR Couriers had 14400 2 years before the Supra (1989).
The Supra was *cheap*. That was really its only differentiator.

Why do people repeat the gift cards stuff unquestioningly?
Yes, you can buy gift cards with Butts. Mostly gift cards bought with stolen credit cards.
Know what else you can buy gift cards with? Real money. Why would I want internet beans when I can have real money instead?
