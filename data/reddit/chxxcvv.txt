It isn't hard. It's just that all the legal sites require your id. If you want to go illegal there are options, but it costs a bit more.

Probably less than 50000 individuals use it. Maybe less than 10000. There's absolutely no way that millions of Venezuelans are using bitcoin.

Try with like $50 first.. I'd never do $1000 in a single tx

Without 3rd party services or a full node how would you connect to the bitcoin network? In theory you can use a light client but maybe whatever full node you connect too is then a 3rd party service?

Sounds like a scam

Well it's probably a non starter then.

This is interesting because it shows why some people were so sure that tether was unbacked - they must have known about the assets at crypto capital being seized ,/ frozen... But if the us is holding 850 million of customer assets it seems likely they will eventually have to give it back. In a way tether is now backed by the government - even if they don't see it that way and there may be some court fees to process the withdrawal

I'm not sure about that, but it will probably be possible to use it for real-time remote imaging of cities. Like CCTV except it'll be able to see inside buildings to a limited degree. It should also be possible to recognize individuals and track their movements. Basically imagine the whole city inside an airport scanner.

If they were willing to try 10 times they'd probably get at least one free MacBook

The large price spikes help to shake out weak hands

Not really. The best way to do it would be to send the transaction paying you directly to your node, and send the double spend directly to the miners nodes. Obviously that would require direct connections to all parties, but getting closer would also be good. You might also play around with child pays for parent double spends in addition or instead of increasing the fee in the double spend tx. In ideal conditions you could probably do it almost every time.

Yea but that's what a bank license is - a license to comingle. Bitfinex doesn't have one.

Use coinbase pro

Those three sites are all legal.. maybe some others aren't.. although crypto is still fairly unregulated so the main question isn't if it's legal but if it's a scam where the site will steal your money or crypto.

I did something similar in 2018.. bought in around 6k.. so far paid off about half the loan.. I'm still worse off than if I had just invested monthly but maybe by the time the rest is paid I'll be up.

There are two different operations merchants can do with your cc; Auth and capture. Auth is where most of the anti fraud stuff happens and also it reduces your available credit for a few days or until a capture happens which references that Auth. The capture is the part where the merchant gets your money. It's optional though as you can just go straight for a capture instead of doing an Auth first. The capture operation generally has a lot less anti fraud stuff. 
All you need is the 16 digit account number  no pin or CVV or anything. On the other hand it's probably easier for a customer to charge back a capture only payment. So doing the optional Auth step is just for the merchants protection. But basically I think this explains your story.. fraudsters can easily bill your card either with a cooperating or negligent merchant, while you can't with a more diligent authing one.

Those instructions don't seem to setup a hidden service, which would be required for incoming connections.

Tbh if you're mining there won't ever be a surplus to feed back, so it doesn't really matter. You also don't need batteries.

You run them on variable amounts of grid power

The petro thing is interesting but I've tried to buy some and it's not listed on any cryptocurrency exchanges. The govts site wouldn't let me buy any either even using someone's vz id card.. basically there's no way there's any adoption on that either, as it's too hard perhaps impossible even to buy it. I'd say if anyone has ever made any transactions on the petro blockchain it's still in a poc stage of development.

Seems like a pretty bad idea. Their debt might quadruple unexpectedly.

Most exchanges don't really give you access to deposit options for countries other than where you're resident. If the goal is to move USD to GBP you'd be way better off using TransferWise or currencyfair.com.

Spam and hacking friendly? :P
Seriously, I don't think anon VPS hosting is long-term viable.
