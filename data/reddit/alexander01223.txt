If bitcoin ends up replacing paper currency and solve so many problems of paper currency, it should personally or completely replace paper currency on the long run. How much paper currency is out there, it's about 200 trillion dollars worth of paper currency out there in the world and there's only about 200 billion dollars of cryptocurrency, so that's an 100 thousand percent from here. You know that can give bitcoin a price of i don't know maybe maybe 8 million dollars so 1 million dollars would even be a discount to where bitcoin will eventually go.
Who knows bitcoin might rise very high which the world will start buying...
