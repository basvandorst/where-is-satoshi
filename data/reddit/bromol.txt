The fork is based on median time of last 11 blocks. So it will stop following the same chain 6 blocks after 12:20.

You are using locks that are appropriate for their task, aren't you?


If it turns out (in the future), that my life is in danger (not literally) , because i am using bitcoin, then i would welcome changes to bitcoin that better protect my identity. After all, i prefer my communication to be private. And communication is the only thing necessary to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:41:39
There is a difference between the operation of the network and contracts that use bitcoin as a currency/security/whatever.
I think the operation of the network should be resilient against government intervention (also legal action) and in the same spirit can not depend on government intervention to protect itself against attacks.
Contracts by users should be protected by law. But the contract itself must define what it considers as bitcoin. There is no law that defines the consensus rules of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:37:10
But that is not the reality that BCC miners are experiencing ... they are loosing money. They are mining at 26% difficulty (about 4 times as fast) but for less than 10% of the reward. Combined thats less than 40% of the reward. 37.5% * 2.66 = 100%. Thats where 2.66 came from.
Someone mislabeld revenue as profit where no profit is to be made.

@_date: 2017-08-01 12:52:48
Timestamps can be manipulated. Upcoming valid blocks can still have timestamps before 12:20 (but later than the current median time). So more than 6 blocks might be necessary.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:20:01
Isn't there replay protection? The BCH transactions can not be taken from the BTC chain.

You can not do that without side effects (shutting down the internet, starting a global crisis/war).


It is not *laws* that stop somebody from doing this right now.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:46:38
It is still possible to mess with the block timestamps. They can be backdated to the current median time. Upcomming blocks can have timestamps older than 12:20. So it impossible to predict the last block that is accepted as valid for the BCH chain.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:22:31


I think that's still an open question. The design assumes selfish miners in a closed world with only one valid chain. If someone creates incentive (outside bitcoin) for all miners to stop mining (seize all hardware, mine another valid chain), bitcoin will take major damage. And the protocol upgrades aren't part of the designed self-regulating incentive structures. Most likely something will take its place. Maybe bitcoin as it already is now, or bitcoin with some future modifications (PoW change?), or bitcoin with some past modifications (existing forks?) or some other crypto currency. There is no certainty in this.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:25:53
I would assume that the first forked block (&gt; 1MB) already needs the new transactions.
But it looks like there are enough BCH transactions (

Yeah, and we are using encrypted communication because of all the protection the laws provide. Governments all over the world are collecting/scanning all the communication they can (based on the laws they made). I'm fine with paying my taxes. But i'm not fine with revealing all my financial transactions. Especially if i am a journalist, a lawyer or part of the opposition. Wherever *possible* i like to have tools available to protect myself, without depending on the laws and others.


And when laws change and allow to enslave you, you are going to be a happy slave? I like to have tools available to me, that remain available in a changing world.

You can mine the more profitable chain and simultaneously convert the mining reward into the coin you expect to have more value in the future. These are independent decisions. The given value of 2.66 was obviously derived by using current fiat values for both coins.

That's a difficult question. Without laws i would strengthen the door until i feel safe (enough). Without locks i would need to trust others obeying the laws.
If you are about to being attacked by someone else with a knife. How do you defend? Do you say: *hey, consider the sentence for stabbing someone, before you stab me*, or do you defend yourself by force.
Laws don't protect individuals against crimes. They protect the society by preventing crimes.

Everybody mining BCC now is not doing it for instant profit. They either want to 'attack' the chain (for example by preventing further difficulty reductions) or they really believe that there is some future profit (unrelated to the block rewards).

Scenario: China (as a state) pumps BCHs value to a level where it is more profitable to mine it instead of BTC for some time. BCH supply is limited so this is much cheaper than directly manipulating BTC markets. BTC will be in trouble. BTC hashrate will be low. China will use its control over local hashrate to attack the BTC chain. BTC has the option to change its PoW (which drives all existing hashrate towards BCH). China eats the cake. Even if done publicly, the damage to BCH (in the eastern world) can be minimal. China-Coin is real. The future of BTC with changed PoW is uncertain.
So what's the cost of that attack (if that's even a factor)? What are possible mitigation strategies? How would a PoW change play out? Who is working on this **now**?

Yes there is.


I don't agree. I say: **bring it on**. Bitcoin needs this to prove its value and to define/defend its position against other cryptocurrencies. It is unlikely that bitcoin is the answer to every use case. It might even fail. But the attacks are a necessary part of the development.

But the law *protects* my life no matter what i do. These laws are not related to Bitcoin in any way.
And there is no certainty that Bitcoin can be stopped this way. I might stop using it, because *laws* don't actually protect me against knifes/bullets/*accidents*. But sure enough there are people that get their protection by other means outside the laws. Or there are simply to many people using it. Satoshis disappearance (independent of its cause) apparently did not stop bitcoin.

Only if the amount of BCC available to the markets is the same as BTC. I assume that there is much more BCC that will never move than there is lost BTC.

Check the chart. The 6E hashes are from before the fork and belong to BTC.
They have 16 blocks vs. 185 for BTC. By that measure they have about 8% of BTCs hashes since the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:30:10


It is more than that. It was able to attract a significant fraction of hashrate for more than 2 days.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:53:20
On the (more) profitable chain it is possible to secure your reward instantly at the cost of 0.018%. Thats the point. Currently nobody is mining BCC for the block reward.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:05:10


Not useless, but perhaps negligent.


I don't think i can. But the promise of bitcoin is (my understanding), that the operation of the network does not need external help (by trusted entities). Sure, i may need help in enforcing a contract that includes bitcoin transactions (but i don't need help in proving that a transaction happened).
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:18:01
I don't *use* laws. And i didn't create them. Are you securing your property with a lock on the door? Even though there are laws that protect your property?


That's some strange conclusion. My suggestion is that bitcoin should be as strong and resilient against all kinds of attacks without depending on external power and trust. Everybody should defend his favorite blockchain (and not complain about the existence of the attack). And if you identify a weakness in a competing chain **exploit it now**.

100 blocks are less than a day. The daily rate on BTC loans is 0.018% on poloniex. So you can sell immediately for the additional cost of 0.018% and pay back the loan with the delayed block reward.

I don't understand what you mean. Is there a law that defines what Bitcoin is? Are the consensus rules protected by law? Are all miners forced by law to continue mining some specific chain?
I understand that there are laws that somehow affect bitcoin. So we are able to close a legally binding contract that includes bitcoin in some way.
But lets assume there is some flaw/bug in the design of bitcoin and its value vanishes. That's it. Game over. I legally owe you 1 BTC? Fine, here it is, still worthless.
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:09:55
I think it is enough to have a fully validated utxo set. The blockchain can be partitioned and distributed. As long as it is not completely lost, everything can be validated at any time. And the utxo set size is currently decreasing.
And in reality nobody would accept a reorg of several days or weeks, even if it is backed up by hash power and should be considered valid by the current consensus rules. Currently you trust the genesis block, but you can also decide to trust some arbitrary later block together with its utxo set and massively reduce the required storage.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:03:05


Yes, perfectly right. And nowhere i said: stop informing other people.


That might also be right. My understanding is, that bitcoin is designed to be trustless. Yes, i can trust the client software to validate the chain for me. But i can do it by myself or review the sources.
But i don't want do trust/depend on other peoples behavior. I don't want do depend on:
* everybody not sending spam
* everybody not attacking the p2p network
* everybody not starting forks at arbitrary times
* everybody not exploiting design flaws (e.g. asic-boost)
* someone taking legal action to protect bitcoin
I decide to use a blockchain **AS IS**. I don't need any additional promise. The remaining risks must be factored into my valuation.
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:53:54
Lets say you invest $1000 in mining to earn $1050 on one chain. On the other chain you earn $395 (=$1050/2.66) . That's $50 profit against a $605 loss. One chain is profitable, the other is not. The other chain is not less profitable, it is not profitable at all.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:23:25
If you want to determine the value of something, you should compare it against something that has constant value for *you*. For example you could compare it against your monthly (disposable) income. If my income would jump to $1M a month, everything that can be bought for $ would drastically decline in value.
Even considering inflation, $1000 had much more value to me when i was a student, compared to now. The very same would hold for something material like a car. And it might change drastically in the future.

BCH is no longer following the BTC chain, but for a fork there needs to be a block on their side. Otherwise there is no BCH.

But isn't all of this unsafe? The new signal could be faked and with its  activation a minority that actually implements the rule will get its blocks orphaned. The SF signaling makes it easy to trick minorities into refusing valid blocks.
For me it seems to be more profitable (in terms of BTC share) for a colluding majority to battle it out on the blockchain without any announcement.

Increasing block size while keeping transaction size fixed solves quadratic scaling of signature hashing.
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:33:00
I would assume that exchanges are among the most economically significant players. But they profit from fees for transactions that they process off-chain internally. Do they really loose anything by a chain split which gives them another coin to trade?
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:48:09
Is it possible that the new version bit will simply mean that supporting nodes will start to ignore blocks not signaling Segwit via its original version bit. At 80% hashrate those blocks not signaling (original) segwit will be orphaned and the original Segwit activation mechanism will kick in. This could already be done without signaling at all by miners controlling 80% (or even less) hashrate. The new signal would simply give the community a visible indicator.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:13:39
A hashrate minority can not attack the BIP 9 signaling. As soon as a (robust) majority signals, the minority blocks can be orphaned to get 100% signaling blocks on the longest valid chain. This would require some coordination by the signaling majority but it would be in their interest (They get a larger share of block rewards).
I think UASF is only a thing, because there is nothing at stake. How large would the support be if you had to commit to the destruction of your "legacy" coins at flag day? A fork should not be called a "split" because nothing gets split. Your keys remain valid on both chains. Its more like chain duping (as item duping in gaming).
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:46:42
The second simultaneous softforks that forces a non-Segwit block into the chain is purely hypothetical and nothing that exists yet. It is a possible way for those who want to stay away from the UASF chain, even if that chain gets a majority. I was only discussing the possibility that it can be done, not that this is the situation we are in right now.
The situation should not only be evaluated based on the current state. Everybody has still time left to react and prepare forks however they want.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:48:35
Segwit only solves the quadratic scaling problem for Segwit transactions, right? So even after Segwit activation you can not simply increase the block size (that is available to old style non-Segwit transactions) without having to deal with quadratic scaling of signature hashing for non-Segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:29:39
Adding a checkpoint is a soft fork and needs only to be implemented by miners. The chain would remain valid for all other (non UASF) nodes. It would not force other nodes onto this chain if it is shorter. But it would protect miners and exchanges (that implement it) from reorgs.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:25:22
This was a response to "it has enabled just 6% of miners or more to overrule the choices made by the community".
Almost (not just) 70% of hashpower do not signal for Segwit. Miners are selfish and thats the only thing we should expect from them.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:42:58
In german there is a proverb: "Das Gegenteil von gut ist gut gemeint." (The opposite of "good" is "well-meant"). It is not the intention that counts, it's the result. Miners are signaling that they are not "technically ready". Whether this is the truth or a lie (to increase their profit) does not matter. Bitcoin was designed to work in a trustless environment. So it was naive to trust miners.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:58:13
It is simply a safeguard to ensure you stay on the chain you want. If an exchange offers trading for the "legacy" coin it should be protected against reorgs. For some it is not important to be on the majority chain, but protection against reorgs is important. A checkpoint protected legacy coin would be much more valuable than the unprotected one (which is not even a proper coin). Adding replay protection would also be on the wishlist.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:02:15
if each of the small spam transactions payed the same fee in sat/B they would have also out-payed all other transactions. There is no difference.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:21:35
I would assume that for exchanges there is value in every coin. A losing branch is not a proper coin. A losing branch that is protected against reorgs by a checkpoint is a proper coin that can be traded. I am not predicting value here.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:54:38
Checking the header is enough to protect against a DOS attack, because creating a valid header (for an otherwise invalid block) is as expensive as creating the header for a valid block.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:16:31
Blocks from a 6% minority could easily be orphaned by the supporting 94% of hashpower resulting in 100% support on the longest valid chain.
Reality: It is not a minority of hashpower that does not signal for Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:56:08
But spam transactions don't have to do something meaningful. Their purpose is to occupy some fraction of the available space (in bytes) for transactions and their cost is calculated based on their size. If spam transactions pay 100 sat/B it does not matter what type they are (many small or few large) or whether they use Schnorr signatures.
For all other users it has a benefit if their useful transactions are as small as possible.
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:43:38


Transaction cost is determined by size in bytes. If useful transactions are cheap, so is spam. Spam is only expensive if all other transactions are also expensive.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:26:55
A checkpoint is an extra rule, so it is a softfork. Two simultaneuos softforks with contradicting additional rules will never reorg one way or the other. Only the legacy nodes that did not decide for one of them would be at risk.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:37:00
If there are two simultaneous softforks (on ignoring the first non-Segwit block after UASF activation and one forcing this block to be part of the chain) these chains cant reorg on way or the other for nodes that decided for one of those two (contradicting) softforks. Only nodes that did not decide for one of them would be at risk by simply following the longest chain which might switch at arbitrary times.

And that was the required fee to get a guaranteed confirmation in the very next block. check  and select 240-260 sat/B. there were 6 occasions in the last 24 hours (by my count) where that fee level was not enough to get into the next block.
300 sat/B is the lowest one that was always below 1MB transaction size during the last 24 hours.
If the recommendation is for "confirmation within 1 block", then 300 sat/B was correct.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:36:44
check  and select 220-240 sat/B fee level. From 5:00 to 7:00 a 240 sat/B transaction would not have been confirmed. It is the occasional long block time that drives up estimated fees.
@_date: 2017-07-04 17:36:16
If you pay the same high fee (in sat/B) for your many small transactions, they will all instantly overtake many others.
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:45:19
Maybe it wasn't the intention to give miners a vote. But obviously the miners are playing by the rules given to them and everybody accepts their blocks. It does not matter what they signal or whether they use asicboost. The blocks are valid. If there are loopholes in the design the designer should be blamed.
Everybody is free to change the rules but also needs to provide incentives for others to join. You can not simply trust developers or miners or other nodes to act in your own interest. That's your task. Choose your software (chain/fork/currency) and service providers according to your needs.
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:50:20
The attacking hash power can be existing hash power. Governments have means to "convince" people to do things.
Shutting down 70% (or more) of the hash power would cost nothing (for one state).
Using the same hash power for any kind of attack would also cost nothing.

@_date: 2017-06-21 07:13:24
That is not enough. They promise to orphan blocks not signaling bit 1after reaching 80% on bit 4. If they fake signal, they risk mining on top of an invalid block (without bit 1 set) after activation because they would still consider them to be valid.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:40:02
That's the point. They need to actually run segwit2x the moment it activates. You said: "There's no need to run additional software."
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:58:35
Then all existing coins would need to be locked to defend against the attack.
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:09:05
I think it is important to have the fork visible on the blockchain and prevent legacy nodes from following this chain. Otherwise the chain spilt happens at an arbitrary later time. The split is important to actually gauge the value of the forked coin.
@_date: 2017-06-29 09:53:08
Yes, but the first two points of your original post are wrong. You do not need to surpass all existing hash power. It is much cheaper and more easy for a (one) government to bring existing hash power under its control. And some might argue that this already happened (not necessarily to attack bitcoin via a 51% attack).

Calculating the hash is not difficult. Solving for input that that has a hash value with special properties is hard (not difficult). The solution algorithm used is the most simple one available: checking all possible inputs. Thats because the problem was designed to allow no shortcuts (ASICBOOST revealed a design flaw, its not an exploit).
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:25:01
If miners just install core 0.14.2 and someone **else** mines a non-signaling block, they will mine on top of this invalid block. Depending on hashrate distribution this might lead to a temporary split. At the very least it wastes resources while mining on top of invalid blocks, waiting for the valid chain to become longer.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:16:20
Actual code is located at 
There are currently 15 open issues and 5 pullrequests. Most (all?) of them are related to the hardfork part. The Segwit softfork activation mechanism seems to be final.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:07:06
They will start with the original core-compatible Segwit code. Only the activation mechanism was changed. During the activation the core client will consider non-signaling (bit 1) blocks as valid, while they will actually be orphaned (assuming segwit2x hashrate majority singaling at bit 4). After Segwit (bit 1) activation consensus rules are identical up to the sheduled hardfork.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:30:16
Activation is definitely an incompatibility. After Segwit2x lock-in (80% of 336 block window), non-signaling blocks will be considered invalid and be orphaned. All other clients will still consider these blocks to be valid. They will only follow the Segwit2x chain, because it is longer (if so). Reorgs might happen on the way.
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:53:53
Why not use existing hash power under your control?
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:57:25
A minority has no veto power. The majority can always orphan the minority blocks to get rid of them. Segwit signaling is at about 30%.
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:17:35
So you are assuming they are not also in control of large amounts of CPU/GPU processing power? Have a look at the first two positions in the current top500 list.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:05:06
The 2x hardfork requires a &gt; 1MB base blocksize block at the fork. So it is protected against reorgs and can survive with minority hashpower.
Correction: It will most likely use a HARDFORK_VERSION_BIT in nVersion to be SPV compatible.
@_date: 2017-06-30 08:19:41
That strongly depends on hashrate distribution. With 30% fake signaling on bit 4 (those that signaled bit1 even before segwit2x was a thing) it will be much different than what we have now.
