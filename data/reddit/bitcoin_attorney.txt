That's also my thought here.  I would like to answer some of the common questions that people bring up about the legality of bitcoin, and its potential interaction with existing laws and regulatory agencies.  It's for the community's benefit as well as my own.
I this vein I have read many egregious misstatements of law (and facts) in my time in the bitcoin community.  I'd like to help clear that up.

In the mean time, [here]( is a good 2011 article from a Yale student which considers some of the legal issues surrounding bitcoin.  Reuben Grinberg, Bitcoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency, 4 Hastings Sci. &amp; Tech. L.J. 159, 167 (2012).

I'll look into this for free and post my answer.  I will probably wait until tomorrow.

I 100% acknowledge that.  To confirm my qualifications, though, I would have to sacrifice my anonymity, which (at least at this point) I would like to maintain.
I am going to try and answer most questions for free and just accept donations.  If you have a very particular question, then we can figure an alternative solution.
By the way, I am actually considering this as a business model, in which case I would of course operate openly.  This is just a proof-of-concept for me (and you).

Here is my legal analysis:
Your comment is uninformed and worthless.  Providing legal commentary and analysis is perfectly ethical, and it allows attorneys to educate the citizenry about the laws by which they are governed.  Practicing attorneys frequently provide such analysis.  *See, e.g.,* [here]( (Duane Morris articles) or [here]( (Latham articles).  
It is eminently reasonable to believe that general commentary and analysis will be taken only as commentary and analysis, especially when accompanied by an express disclaimer that any such analysis is *not* legal advice and should not be used as such.  
People like you restrict the free flow of information and lead to societal corruption and decay.  I wouldn't wish you upon my worst enemy.

Hi Greg.  I do indeed have access to Westlaw and Lexis (along with some other resources).  I am deciding how much citation to include based on the audience here.  I want it to be easy to read and understand.
I'm glad you mention ethical considerations.  Not only is the ethical practice of law extremely important to me, but I take my oath very, very seriously.  Every step has been, and will continue to be, carefully thought through.  I will take every precaution to avoid violating ethical standards, professional responsibilities, and laws under the Constitution.  I'm here to provide insight and to help the people understand their laws. 
I will be very careful to avoid giving anything close to legal advice, and I've decided for now not to accept any compensation.  Thank you anyway to those who thought to tip.  I appreciate the gesture.  
I'm going to tackle the SEC question in the next couple of days and post some information for everyone.

Unless you want to quiz me.
