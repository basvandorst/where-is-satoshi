Well done!

Do you think there is the possibility that mining bitcoin will evolve and therefore needing less power or is it because of the complexity that it needs so many resources. Too bad other appliances that running anyway can't mine bitcoins like windmills and such :)

I was using Visa/Mastercard as most of us here. I still need to check if the bank charged extra(cash advance fee) last week when I last used it. I hope not.
Anyway since I read about the extra fees that the banks asks, I did a couple of SEPA transfers and I got one after 2 days and another after one day. But the previous times was also around 2 days. I think in November it was 3 days.
So I'd say around 2/3 days.
But I don't like what Visa did with those extra fees! (They are really trying to make it harder for us to buy crypto)
