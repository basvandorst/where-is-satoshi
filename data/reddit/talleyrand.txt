I don't know why this argument has become so popular during the last 3 months but the concept of "private blockchain" is vastly overblown and mostly pushed by companies like IBM who probably make good money on the hype by selling consulting services related to it. 
The advantages of the blockchain tech is that you can build a decentralized and distributed network with an immutable, resilient and very secure ledger, advantages that are that at worst all defeated and at best mitigated if it's private/permissioned, you will probably just end up with a shitty database most of the time.
Now I don't say permissioned blockchain have no use at all but they aren't exciting nor disruptive of anything, you won't build a new industry on that.

I agree, I don't get why people are so upset about this, the more the market is prepared and thought about it the less a shitshow it will be when the announcement will come.

And you strawman like someone who can't actually provide an argument.
Never said anything about valuation, also that's not buzzwords, that's meaningful properties making blockchain attractive in the first place.
It's the equivalent of saying that the jet engine
 is an interesting technology because it can easily produce the thrust required to make things fly, now you can put a jet engine on a truck too if you want but it will provide no utility compared to already existing solutiobs.

If they control the mining it almost entirely defeats the purpose of having blockchain.
Also considering that most government services still aren't fully accessible online it will not happen tomorrow.
