Bank of Montreal (BMO) a massive Canadian Bank has become so scared of both crypto and the power of the people that they have resorted to such low professionalism and lack of transparency. It makes me sick how a massive business like BMO can take away my financial freedoms from my own checking account (not credit cards) actual funds I have earned and for "my own protection" choose what I can and cannot invest in. I am still allowed to go to a casino and put 10,000 on red or transfer $5000 to bet365 to bet on a sports game or even buy 100 bottles of liquor to get wasted but an investment in a revolutionary technology no that's something the good ole bank needs to protect me from. The people aren't stupid we see the fear eyes from your outdated systems and obsolete technology but the fact BMO doesn't even have the balls to make an announcement proves to me they are scared of us and of crypto. Hodl boys and girls revolutions are never easy. I hope some Canadians voice their displeasure with having their freedoms taken away so sneakily and unprofessionally because I for one have... Closed my account with BMO immediately.
