Hmm, good point.
The reason is that up until now, Meerkat's been aimed at companies in various industries, giving them a place to read news and also discuss things internally. So logging in gives a private place to do discussions.
But you've raised a really good point, everything should just be publicly visible without having to login.

Thanks for checking it out. Looking forward to serving you weekly BTC news.
Hit me up if you have other topics you want to keep an eye on.
 works now, but I need to fix it so that once you get there, it doesn't revert to /topic/5/
Good call on landing page.

Thanks! I was definitely inspired by the "Show HN" format.
made some good suggestions on this thread, so I've deployed some changes to the invite page (like displaying some actual content, without having to login). Let me know what you think of it now.

Awesome, here's a sign-up form where you just enter your email:
Any reason why you don't login via Google on mobile? Sorry I'm a UX noob.

Nice. I just deployed a change, to display actual content, before logging in.
Also re-worded the messaging to "Login to see news and discussion"
Let me know what you think of it now. Thanks a lot for the feedback, you seem to have an eye for UX. What do you do?

Thanks! To answer your question...
1) We scrape everywhere we can: coindesk, techcrunch, etc. It just so happens Coindesk dominates, based on Meerkat's algo.
2) Then a machine-learning algo looks at the actual content of the article, to see if it's substantive and relevant
3) Finally we check to see it's also trending on social media (twitter, reddit)
4) The blurb is an algo summary of the article, not just the beginning of the article.
This filtering results in high-quality content, weeding out "fluff" articles and random "to the moon" posts on What makes Meerkat the most valuable is actually the email digest. It ranks the top 10 articles of the week (or of the day), so if you're busy, you can quickly see what's been going on.
I'm not sure how to pitch that on the landing page, yet. Maybe you have ideas lol
Would love it if you logged in, and gave some feedback there. Seems like you have a good eye.
