So what happened to the murder for hire charges? The article mentions nothing of this. I'm all ready to get mad about this sentencing, provided that was not actually true. Anybody know?
EDIT: Ok so after some reading it seems that all these charges and sentences are not for the murder for hire thing. So I'm officially pissed now. Ulbricht wasn't a saint, but none of us are and he doesn't deserve life in prison for these particular so-called crimes.

See, the logical part of my brain says writing some software to search for private keys with a balance is a silly thing to do, but alas I also have a silly side.

Basically they let you skip some of the more lengthy steps of getting your USD into an exchange, as they're already set up to do that. You give them your USD, they'll use their existing accounts to credit or just exchange it immediately for BTC and send them to your address.
If you have no real interest in doing frequent trading on an exchange or exchanges in large volumes and are mainly looking for a quick one-off, BitInstant is the way to go.

So actually. Maybe I will write this program and release it. Any new people or anybody who feels like they don't trust the math is free to run it and see for themselves how unlikely it is to find the private key for a valuable address.
@_date: 2012-09-27 05:57:36
Wow, really? Where from?
@_date: 2012-10-01 07:05:06
Hmmm that makes sense actually. The time to pull down each block went up in what seemed like a very exponential way. The first 10,000 took maybe only a few hours, and by the end, each new block was taking up to a minute each. I figured it was just them growing larger with time, but they didn't get *that* large, so I doubted it.
An exponentially increasing number of DB writes makes much more sense! Thanks for the info!

Yep, you're right. I did oversimplify it. Apologies. I was thinking of what's necessary for perfect or near perfect unbluring. 
Combined with the black/white source, error correction in QR codes, and the fact that you can check the obscured private key against the clear public one means that the private key is probably not safe. 
Plus, the effect on the code in the last image looks pretty weak as it is. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:50:58

To sell something like that to "the masses," you have to sell someone on the idea of BTC. That's kind of hard to do do at the moment, especially with the market doing things like it's been doing. Sure there are suckers, but that'll hurt Bitcoin's credibility in the long run. At this point, I think we're better suited to telling friends and helping them get up and running if they're less technically inclined.

ELI5: Basically all the software used to edit, save, and transmit the images is all designed to minimize the file size while making sure the image still looks OK to human eyes. By default, it cleverly discards information and simplifies the data of the image to do this. Thankfully for OP, it just so happens that this is the data you would need to undo the blur!

Hardly. It's a classic example of a bubble.
@_date: 2011-05-19 04:31:39
Well yeah, that can get you an estimate, but not an actual, measured hash rate. The graphs linked above clearly define them as estimates, but other places do not specify that. I was wondering if there *was* a way to get an measured value and not an estimation based on time per block.
@_date: 2011-06-14 07:45:17
Getting to the limit of my knowledge here, but I think I recall reading that as the blockchain gets longer, new client downloads will include an abbreviated blockchain for very old blocks, which should keep the time to validate each transaction down.
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:22:56
Technically it can be, but in practice it's likely not possible. In this case (assuming they were Gaussian blurs) the images are 8 bit per channel JPEGs so the information needed to reverse the blur has almost definitely been destroyed entirely.
EDIT: It's been pointed out below that while you might not be able to perfectly reverse the blurring done in these images, you wouldn't need to. It's probably possible to get the private key in this case. My bad. The point about perfect reconstruction still stands though. 
@_date: 2011-05-17 02:19:46
Additionally you can use [a laundering service]( to further anonymize the transaction which is especially useful when there are a low volume of transactions, as there are now. It just takes time to do.

He checks runs through his blockchain to determine A's balance prior to the new, as-yet unapproved transaction. If A didn't have enough BTC to cover the transaction, the miner won't publish that transaction in the next block.

OK, so here's a question. Where do these numbers come from? I've been reading up on Bitcoin for a few days now and I'm not aware of any mechanism of hash/s reporting by any nodes. Sure the pools report their (supposedly accurate) Ghash/s values, but what about all the people solo mining? How does that get factored in?
@_date: 2011-05-19 18:47:38
Well sure then! How did you want to proceed?
@_date: 2011-05-17 22:35:00

That's about what you should be getting, it looks like. Short of overclocking (possibly a terrible idea on a laptop), there's really nothing else you can do to improve the performance. You miiiight try other OpenCL miners, as it appears some are more efficient than others, but I wouldn't expect a miracle.

Yep! That's the whoooole point. Your transaction data from all the way back in June is mathematically incorporated into the current block, with a trivially verifiable but difficult to forge chain from your June block to the current one!

I think you've misunderstood. On these BTC dice sites there are players and investors. They're two separate groups (but not necessarily mutually exclusive).
The investors really are investing. They essentially get a cut of the house's cut proportional to their initial investment. The players on the site are paying into/payed out of that pool of funds when they win/lose bets. You could argue that investing in a casino/dice game doesn't really cause growth though.

And just in case you were unaware, the Web and the Internet are two distinct things.
The Internet is the actual physical and logical network that connects everyone's devices together and allows them to communicate.
The Web is a set of technologies to move documents around at a user's request, essentially. It runs *on* the Internet, but it is not the only thing that does.

The difficulty is only adjusted to match the hashing rate every 2016 blocks. For 10 minute blocks, this is about 2 weeks.
When the fork occurs, both forks have the same difficulty and will probably have the same difficulty until well after the problem is resolved. The few people on 0.8 are going to quickly fall behind as their fork is tuned to match the full network hashrate.
