I was just wanting to make clear that miners have no control over fees, they are decided by free market, albeit heavily influenced for the past month or so by large mempool.
There are solutions to this. I am not a 'big-blocker' but increasing the block size would temporarily solve the high fee issue but it would require a hard fork and is very unpopular with most as it can lead to centralization. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:40:39
Transaction fees aren't controlled by miners. They're controlled by users in a free market type system.
The hodl mentality is stupid and is just little boys enjoying their memes.

His 'piece of paper' (private key) is much safer than trusting a third party (regulated or not).
If coinbase get hacked and their funds stolen, they are gone. Regulations won't help here.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:15:27
If you don't control your private key you don't own bitcoin.
Get a wallet.
A simple (software) wallet to use and set up is [electrum](
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:39:39
Electrum is currently recommending a 766 sat/byte transaction for inclusion in the next 10 blocks.

You could send from GDAX straight to another exchange for 0 fee.

Nope. It's another untechnical technical analysis.

I want you to re-read what you have just wrote.
Is bitcoin's 'source of power' the fact that it is always under attack?
Does bitcoin's value as a store of wealth have anything to do with anything that you have talked about?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:44
Ah yes. The unsinkable ship. That worked out fantastic last time :)

Create a wallet for them, give them the keys, send them some BTC and a link to preev.com
When they start monitoring it and see it rise at a much higher rate than their "high interest" savings account, they might take notice and start researching.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:22:58
I feel like you're leading me down a route you already know the answer to.
Please.... get to the point.
Do you think, with current fees, it is cheaper to send money with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:24:28
Keep an eye on the [unconfirmed transactions](
Yesterday it peaked and now that miners are coming back to BTC it is now dropping quite steadily. As this number drops fees should drop with it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:07:19
I could imagine a few headlines... I imagine they'd involve sentences like:
"Bitcoin upgrades network"
"Bitcoin - Double the block... Double the profit???"
"BCH, BTC, B2X - Click here to see which coin dominates!"
Fuck the headlines. I'm interested in what is best for making this system work.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:22:34
Thank you u/Cryptohodlr for posting this!! Seriously, if there was a tip-bot here, I'd be tipping.
Fantastic video! Apart from a few 'oldskool' senators not quite getting it,  I really felt like they realised that something big was happening and they were lucky to have Andreas there to explain.
I try to avoid fanboyism as much as I can but I really am starting to get fanboyish towards Andreas. I can't find a fault in Andreas' answers. Can someone help me out and argue against him?

So no on the ICO for me but great job having a vision of a Bitcoin ATM on every corner.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:28:25
It always bounces back... until it doesn't.
Holding bitcoin is good. It's been proven to be a good long-term  investment with a very healthy return.
Blindly 'hodling' and expecting the price to continuously rise until moon is not smart, not clever and is playing into the hands of actors that want to manipulate you.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:57:01
But the current situation is we have congestion.
Right now.
Fees are now making BTC unusable as a peer-to-peer currency.
I can currently send money from Iceland to Australia cheaper by using the international banking system.
Something is wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:09:24
Anything by Andreas is worth a watch / read.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:24:18
I also wonder about this... but sadly, I don't think is the place to ask :( Any mention of bigger blocks here and they think you're a shill from [BCH](
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:14:56
He talks until the end of the video (1 hour 52) and it gets better and better.

They applaud him at the end for his performance.

@_date: 2017-11-14 23:11:19
I clearly meant a block increase. Segwit, at the minute, is nowhere near the same level. The theory is there but segwit is 10-15%. When it takes off (which I think it will) it will kick the can further down the road, just like BCH. We're basically hoping that LN and other sub-layer networks gain traction. But ofc, these type of sub-layer networks increase centralization...

Picture the average merchant. What % of them do you think are able to understand and implement the processes in your links.
Creating signed SSL certificates, creating signed payment requests, adding web-sockets... This is beyond small merchants that are not savvy with web technology.
Intermediary systems serve a purpose. They increase the ease-of-use and therefore make Bitcoin more accessible and easy to understand for the layman.
If you can create your own payment system, bully for you! Do it! But please understand that for some people an intermediary provides a safe and understandable introduction to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:55:01

In theory what should happen is the current coin's value should depreciate by the new coins value, but bitcoin generally doesn't follow this rule.
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:28:34
Yes, just buy on GDAX and send to your wallet. You don't need to use coinbase during the process but you need a coinbase account.
