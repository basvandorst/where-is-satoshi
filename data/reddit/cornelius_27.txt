This eBay link doesn't have a Buy-It-Now option, so how do you know how much the seller is prepared to accept for the item? There's only one bid at this time ($990) and it may still be well below the "reserved price".

You're not the only one tired of it. Although I don't condone BFL for their lack of professionalism and misleading statements at times, with all the hate their are getting on Reddit and BitcoinTalk, I am concerned that they may be at risk of going bankrupt now, as I wouldn't even get my pre-ordered hardware as a result. I still cling to the hope of receiving my Single soon enough to reach some sort of ROI.

Cool! I'll definitely use their services again.

I like the idea of a fire-resistant "paper" wallet, i.e. likely to resist your typical house fire, so that it can still be found in the ashes of a burnt-down house. If in addition to being resistant, it also looks nice, I'm sure you should be able to sell a few of these, as it makes a nice present too. One of the problem of paper wallets is paper being so easily destructible (fire, water, sunlight, etc.). 
Also, say you live in a country where your house could be ransacked by barbarians with AK-47's any time soon, even if you have a safe, they'll get it opened one way of the other and they'll find your paper wallet, but if you hide your metal-based QR code under a floor board or in a wall or in your garden, you would still have a good chance to recover it, even many years later (after, say, the barbarians release you from some jail or concentration camp), even if the house was burned down. Not so with a paper wallet.
The only trouble is that you would need to be trusted with knowing the private key, which is not so great, like with the Casacsius coins, although guy who makes them still manages to sell them. Watch out for criminals though, if they buy one of these from you, and somehow get their coins stolen and then get the idea you were the only one who knew the private key, that could become a problem for you.

Very good idea.

WONDERFUL! This will make a difference to a lot of people. It took me many hours to figure out what all these words meant. Now the next guys will have a quicker way to get there. THANKS!

The idea of backlisting coins is a two-edge sword, which is why I think it could be very dangerous for Bitcoin, but I think Mike Hearn did a great job for Bitcoin and he certainly deserves to be granted the right to ask for advice and opinions on pertinent questions.

Not sure why they do that. But if you don't like this solution, you could perhaps open an account for your niece with  and give the spare key to a trusted family member?

If you want decent quality translation and you can afford to pay in BTCs, then you could simply hire experienced professional translators accepting BTCs. There are many translators on Proz.com who will accept BTCs (check this page for example  For your information, ProZ.com is the largest and most popular global website for translators looking for work. You could place an ad and you are likely to get many quotations rapidly. I would translate this for you, but I don't do German and Spanish (only French).

I don't know what this comment is about, but it is abusive and it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the OP. I meant the comment below this one.
