The beautiful thing about a decentralized currency is that none of those things should ever hope to pose a legitimate existential threat.   So the fact that Bitcoin "survived" them, doesn't really mean much.
That's like saying I "survived" getting my dick stuck in my zipper.  Yeah it might've hurt like hell, but my life was never in danger.

It's pretty funny that you would mention scalability.
Just today fluffypony confirmed that XMR is going to implement mimblewimble.  
(Our 35GB blockchain is about to be less than 1MB)
This, combined with XMR's dynamic block size, should actually make it significantly *more* scalable than bitcoin.
I'm ready for the next reason why you think Bitcoin is better than Monero.  
You have some balls accusing Monero of not having the tech to become world class when bitcoin has *__significantly__* more obstacles to overcome, has made almost zero progress towards solving any of these obstacles, and consists of a community that literally ripped itself in half just trying to choose a fucking block size.
Bitcoin enthusiasts are in complete denial.  They think that their community is going to be able to make Bitcoin anonymous and fungible and all these other things. But they don't realize just how many hard forks and drastic modifications to the bitcoin protocol it will take to get there.  And meanwhile, back in reality, the BTC community ripped itself apart and totally shit the bed just trying to decide on a fucking block size, lmao
They have all of these lofty goals that I don't think they can actually accomplish.
Now let's compare that to Monero.  Monero's devs are constantly doing research and implementing technological improvements to the XMR protocol.  Up next is RuffCT to replace RingCT, KOVRI is on the horizon, and now mimblewimble has been announced.
So I have a question for you.  Why do you, as a member of the Bitcoin community, support this dinosaur first-generation technology with its plans to "eventually" and "one day" try to tackle the glaring flaws which are preventing it from being adopted more widely as a currency? (Most notably the public blockchain, which I don't have to tell you is a privacy NIGHTMARE)  Especially when there is ALREADY a superior technology like Monero which has solved many of the problems that haunt Bitcoin, and which it hopes to fix at some vague unspecified time in the future?

You are literally just pulling facts out of your ass.  You have absolutely no idea if Coinbase has been hacked or not.
You really think that Coinbase would just *publish* the fact that they were hacked if it wasn't absolutely necessary?  All we know for sure is that there haven't been any hacks big enough that they and their insurance company were unable to cover the cost themselves, giving them no choice but to tell their customers about it.

Bitcoin is like your abusive alcoholic spouse.   You keep telling yourself and everyone else that bitcoin will change, that things will get better. 
And meanwhile there is someone else, a sexy, funny, and mature person named Monero who is ready to start dating you, just standing there waiting for you to notice them.
I'm sorry but that is such a typical reply and it's exactly what I'm talking about.  Why is it that BTC users cling so tightly to this dinosaur first generation technology and insist on trying to change it to be private and more practical to use, when there are *__already__* better cryptocurrencies like Monero that have solved the anonymity problem?
The fact that you guys call everything but bitcoin an "alt-coin" proves to me that you are closed-minded and unable to see the big picture.
Just admit to yourself that you prefer bitcoin because it's making you money and not because it's a superior technology. that's the first step.  Then the second step is looking ahead to what will happen when the rest of the bitcoin community also figures this out.  The answer is a massive transfer of wealth from BTC to Monero.  I promise you, it's just a matter of time.

That would actually be pretty awesome, a bank that was willing to hold AND INSURE peoples' crypto.  Exchanges sure as hell aren't going to offer that.

@_date: 2017-12-01 03:03:04
Funny you should ask, because Bitcoin's real value right now is almost nothing.  It has enjoyed the advantage of being first to market, but there are FAR superior technologies nipping at its heels and it's only a matter of time until they get their turn.  Anyone who has actually tried using Bitcoin as a currency figures out REALLY fucking quick that having a public blockchain is a security and privacy **nightmare**.   The reason people don't seem to care is because almost all of the people who buy and sell bitcoin aren't actually *using* it, they're just traders who are speculating on its price.  They don't care whether it is actually useful as a currency, they just know they've made 800% gains in 2017.
Imagine if every time you went to the store the cashier could see your current bank account balance as well as a list of all the people you had ever given or received money from.    Seriously, think about that hard.  Think about whether you think that's something people are going to be excited about.  Of course not!!.  And yet, that's EXACTLY how bitcoin works.  Even so, everyone here just circlejerks about how great bitcoin is lol.  
Their logical minds are being completely clouded by the money they are making with bitcoin.  They are unable to see its fatal flaws or analyze the situation honestly and  critically.
Monero, on the other hand, IS completely anonymous, completely decentralized, and more closely resembles digital cash.  Open your mind and you will see that Monero is a vastly superior technology.  One day soon, maybe after the current bubble pops, people will be able to think rationally again and they will re-asses the crypto market.  They will realize that bitcoin is now just a dinosaur first generation novelty coin. There is then going to be a truly massive transfer of wealth from BTC into Monero.  The market cap of bitcoin is over 50 X that of monero... So what do you think is going to happen to the price of Monero when even a *fraction* of the wealth currently stored in bitcoin is moved into Monero?   It's going to grow exponentially.  
I guarantee it's going to happen.  It's only a matter of time.  
Before you let your mind get all upset and clouded with emotion because I dared to criticize bitcoin, take the time to thoughtfully consider what I have said.  Read about Monero.  Read about fungibility.  Why do you think that dark net criminals are completely unanimous about adopting Monero as their new standard currency?  These are the same people that saw the potential behind bitcoin and propelled it into public knowledge years ago. These same people are now rejecting Bitcoin and getting on board with Monero one by one. 
The monero subreddit is FILLED with ex-bitcoiners who have finally seen the light, and there is a STRONG consensus among the community that it's only a matter of time before monero has its time to shine.

I understand that every fiat currency since the beginning of time has had an expiration date, but another existing fiat currency always moves in or a totally brand new fiat currency has popped up to replace it.
Imposing economic sanctions and freezing assets abroad is one of the primary non-violent methods that powerful countries like the USA use to keep smaller nations in line when they misbehave.  
For example, being able to stop the flow of money into and out of a rogue nation whose dictator is committing war crimes against innocent civilians is a tactic that the world's most rich and powerful governments **THOROUGHLY** enjoy being able to use.  Freezing assets and stopping the flow of money in and out of a country is a very powerful tool to motivate 3rd world cunt nuggets to start acting right, unless they want their people to revolt and then sodomize them to death with a large stick in the public square (Gaddafi in Libya).
On top of that, another thing that powerful countries love doing is spending money they don't have.  This is physically impossible with cryptocurrency.  
I don't believe the world's leaders are willing to give up either of these two privileges any time soon.
So I might agree with you on the point that Pandora's box has been opened, cryptocurrencies are here to stay.  
But fiat money will probably remain the the primary method of exchanging small amounts of value between individuals and businesses on a daily basis.

XMR users don't care what the price does, because they actually use it for the intended purpose of crypto__*CURRENCY*__, which is to be used as a currency.    Even so, it has had an even better year than Bitcoin, percent-wise. But the sub still isn't just a massive circlejerk of speculative investors who don't care about the underlying technology.
If you are suggesting that a 51% attack on the monero network is likely, why hasn't anyone been successful? Why didn't they try it back when the network was significantly smaller and weaker?   The coins were still worth something, it wouldn't have been a pointless endeavor.  In fact, why haven't there been ANY successful 51% attacks, on ANY major coin, or ANY coin at all, for that matter?
The only time that a community experimented with using bitcoin as their currency, it failed miserably and is being rapidly and unanimously replaced with Monero. There isn't even a small minority calling for the use of DASH or Zcash or any of the other privacy shitcoins. Literally JUST Monero.
When I buy a sandwich at subway I don't want the zit-faced punk standing behind the counter to be able to see my current bank account balance as well as the amount of every financial transaction I have ever conducted, and who it was with. But people in the bitcoin community don't even stop to think about that because the logical part of their brain is being shut down by all the money they are making.

I would bet that at least 75-80% of the people trading bitcoin have never actually used it to buy anything, so they neither understand nor care that having a public blockchain makes bitcoin a privacy and security nightmare.
I see Bitcoin as being like a bitcoiner's abusive alcoholic spouse. They keep telling themselves and everyone else that bitcoin will change, that things will get better.  They'll add this feature, or they'll incorporate that technology.
And meanwhile there is someone else, a sexy, funny, and mature person named Monero who is ready to start dating them, just standing there waiting to get noticed.
Why is it that BTC users cling so tightly to this dinosaur first generation technology and insist that future modifications to the protocol will fix its problems like making it private and more practical to use.

uhhh, you're joking, right??  **No** legit contender?  Have you actually done any research on other cryptocurrencies?  Bitcoin has completely failed at following through on its original mission of being anonymous and decentralized digital cash.  
It isn't even close to being anonymous, and every day it becomes more and more obvious that something with a public ledger will never be adopted on a large scale as a currency for day-to-day transactions with other people and businesses. 
The only reason Bitcoin has the market cap it does is because it had the first-to-market advantage.  Its current price is determined almost entirely by speculative investors who have never actually used it to buy or sell anything.  Among communities that actually tried using bitcoin as a currency, it became obvious almost immediately that the public blockchain is a privacy and security _nightmare_.
Monero is everything that bitcoin was supposed to be, but isn't.  Truly anonymous and decentralized, fungible digital cash.  It has already solved most of the things wrong with bitcoin and it is still constantly evolving and improving.  The next big upgrade is incorporating RuffCT instead of RingCT, and KOVRI is currently in development.  Just today it was announced that the Monero project is going to work with the mimblewimble technology to improve scalability.  
Meanwhile, the bitcoin community almost ripped itself apart just trying to decide on a block size, lmao.

That's fascinating, what dynasty are you heir to?
About heroin- lots of people use heroin without injecting it, so I'm not sure why you said you don't use heroin specifically because you don't fuck with needles. But I guess that is beside the point, and doesn't really matter for any reason.  I don't personally use any drugs besides a little weed here and there.  But wow, college was crazy haha so much drinking. (At least the first time around).  Makes me sick just thinking about it. 
About those inheritance laws..., that's so unbelievably unfair... I don't understand how that's even possible.  I would love for you to link me to the text of the law so I can try to understand the motivation behind the legislation.  I don't understand why your countrymen would pass such a law.  Cui bono?  Surely the voters of your country would want to be eligible to receive their inheritance if they were in your situation, so what was their reasoning for voting for it?  Even if you live somewhere that the citizens don't vote (which I am sorry if you do), you didn't say that the government gets it you said that your father's siblings get it.  So I don't understand what would motivate the government to push for such a law, either.  Speaking of which, where DO you live?

There you go with the "alt" thing again.  To you guys, everything but bitcoin is an "alt-coin".  It shows just how far up your own asses in denial you are haha :)
Also I strongly disagree that it's the "most decentralized coin".  You think that massive warehouses with row after row of stacks of ASICS and air conditioners is decentralized?  You're dreaming.  Decentralized is an ASIC-resistant coin like Monero that is still mineable with consumer-level CPUs. Not saying you'll make any money doing it, but you can still join a mining pool and donate your collective processing power to a charity of some kind.  This exact thing is actually becoming pretty common among Monero users.  Because Monero can still feasibly be mined with consumer-level CPUs, things like in-browser monero miners are starting to be added to web pages instead of ad banners on some sites.  Swapping a little bit of your CPU power in exchange for an ad-free browsing experience could be the future, and it's made possible by Monero.
Just one of the MANY things Monero can do, that bitcoin can't.

How did I prove *your* point?  What __*is*__ the difference between what I'm saying and what I think I'm saying? Your communication is really lacking in clarity, dude.  You keep just saying something vague like "goalpost moving" without explaining what you mean or giving an example of where, specifically, the goalpost was moved to and from.  When asked to explain it you say some other vague thing, in this case that what I'm saying and what I think I'm saying are two different things.  Again, without elucidating your point in any way.
You can't just dump some word soup on a keyboard with no coherent point or refutation of anything the person you're talking to has said and then exit without fleshing out your ideas.  Well I guess you can, but it seems like a pointless exercise because you have neither helped me understand what you perceive to be the error in my thought process so that I can understand your point of view and maybe even change my mind,  nor have you addressed *my* concerns about *your* point of view.

Once I hand it to you, it has all of your information written on it as well.
I don't want to put words in the author's mouth but I think you are creating a straw man. The possibility of a bitcoin being valued differently because of a tainted history is just one possible *result* of the lack of fungibility, not the *cause* of it.

@_date: 2017-11-29 10:32:57
Hold on, hold on... did you *__seriously__* just try to make the claim that Bitcoin not only meets __*all*__ the criteria of traditional money (it doesn't even come close) , but that it also has fewer downsides? Oh man, I don't even know where to begin...  I'm not saying that USD doesn't have its own flaws, as no fiat currency has ever lasted long.  They always crash.
In my opinion, the only way that bitcoin has had success was by being the first practical widely-adopted method of transferring value of any size between two parties pretty quickly without the help or consent of a 3rd party like a bank.    And this was accomplished over 5 years ago.  Since then, its flaws have just become more and more obvious, and using it as a currency has become less and less feasible.
Now on to just a few of the *__many, many__* fatal flaws and downsides in the bitcoin protocol...
when I buy something at the store for 5 dollars, that 5 dollar bill does not have my net worth printed on it. Bitcoin does.
that 5 dollar bill does not have a record of every transaction that 5 dollar bill has ever been a part of and who the sender and receiver were.  Bitcoin does.
And when I hand that 5 dollar bill to the cashier, he cannot see a list of every transaction I have ever been a part of, as well as the amount and who it was to.
The public blockchain that made bitcoin popular has proven that it is not maturing well.  It is rapidly becoming a gaping fatal wound that strikes at the center of what bitcoin was supposed to be: anonymous, decentralized, digital cash.
Bitcoin is NOT anonymous, in fact it is a security and privacy *__nightmare__*!!  If you want to obscure a bitcoin's source you have to go out of your way using convoluted methods like mixing that are, in addition to being expensive,  being cracked more and more successfully by private companies and the governemnts that fund these companies, in order to (*very successfully, I might add*) develop algorithms that are able to track Bitcoins through the blockchain.  
It's time to finally accept that Monero is everything that bitcoin was promised to be, but failed at actually becoming: truly anonymous decentralized digital cash.
Die-hard bitcoiners are so blinded by the money they are making that they are totally unable to accept new facts and developments in the cryptocurrency space.  There are superior technologies nipping at the heels of bitcoin, and Bitcoin is only in first place today because it had the first-to-market advantage.  If Monero and Bitcoin were both launched at the same time, bitcoin would be a novelty, only used in special situations where extreme amounts of transparency is required like accepting donations for charity online, where you would want the wallet to be easy for the general public to audit.
Tell me, if you had to send a million dollars worth of cryptocurrency to someone, and you knew with 100% certainty that you would be killed if the transaction could be successfully tracked, which cryptocurrency or method would you use to send the million dollars?  Be honest with yourself and reply in your own head.  You don't have to reply.  
Since we both know the answer isn't Bitcoin, what are you going to do with this information?  Are you going to refuse to accept change and progress or are you going to continue to desperately hold on to first generation technology that is outdated and no longer useful for its stated purpose?  
I know that until this bull run is over, none of you are going to be able to think logically.  But keep my words in mind next time you see that XMR is climbing to new all-time-highs as you are simultaneously struggling with bitcoin's many flaws including its complete lack of fungibility and privacy.

It's easy to look back and say "what a ballsy genius!"

Yeah my girlfriend doesn't get this concept either no matter how many times I explain it.  She keeps trying to get me to sell my XMR holdings and buy bitcoin just because of all the news and hype around bitcoin. But I'm like, babe, not only has XMR had a *very* similar year to BTC in terms of percent gains, but in order for bitcoin to double again it needs to add 10K to its price.  For Monero to double it only needs to add like 170 to its price.

OP, unfortunately unless you have a warehouse full of ASICS and air conditioners set up on the doorstep of a hydroelectric power plant where electricity is 5 cents per kilowatt hour, you aren't going to make any money.  I mean zero, not one penny.  Not even if you let your laptop run 24/7 and joined a mining pool.
XMR on the other hand is still mineable using a consumer-level CPU.  You still won't make much, (almost nothing at all) but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  I recommend that instead of trying to go it alone and keeping the proceeds, which won't be very successful anyway, you join a mining pool and use a browser-based XMR miner that automatically sends the proceeds to a charity.  
Especially with just an old laptop, you won't make enough money for it to do you any good.  But together with other peoples' computers all around the world you might be able to make a good wad of cash that will go to a good cause and effect real change in someone somewhere's life.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:42
What goalpost did I move?
All I said was that the price of bitcoin is mostly speculative.  The only thing you could *kind of* base the price upon is something around the cost of the electricity it takes to mine a bitcoin.   
Also, you set up a false equivalency between bitcoin and gold and then used gold as an example to reinforce your perspective on this.
Like BTC, the price of gold is speculative as well, AND it has been used as a currency.  The __*difference*__ between bitcoin and gold is that gold is COMSUMED in all kinds of industries to make products, whereas BTC is simply transferred from one party to another into perpetuity.    And no, people losing their wallet seed is not the same thing lol. 
Anything you can name is just worth what people will pay for it, and gold's price is supported by what these industries are willing to pay.  Bitcoin has no such support.

Why would you EVER keep your cryptocurrency in the hands of a 3rd party like an exchange if you don't absolutely have to?  ESPECIALLY now, when there are so many secure wallet options?  
Would you keep your savings in a bank that could be hacked at any moment, and wasn't FDIC insured? Of course you wouldn't.  And yet the two situations are very analogous. 
the reason you shouldn't store in Coinbase is simple: you don't have to.   And if you don't absolutely HAVE to trust someone with your money, then you don't do it. It's that simple.
If coinbase gets hacked, you are never going to see those coins again unless the hack is small enough for coinbase to completely absorb  the cost.  You are completely at their mercy.

Something with *any* value is infinitely more valuable than something with zero value.  So by definition if USD flops and BTC is still being used in any capacity it will be worth infinity USD.
I know that every single fiat currency in history has collapsed, but you're forgetting that every fiat currency that collapses is just replaced with another fiat currency.  I don't believe that cryptocurrency will ever be the chosen standard unit of value for the entire planet and its various governments.
Governments enjoy being able to sanction countries by freezing their assets when they misbehave.   Governments also like to spend money they don't have.  Neither of these things are even physically possible with Cryptocurrency.
Combine that with the fact that citizens have traditionally consented to giving governments a total monopoly on utilizing violence to enforce its decisions, and you are looking at a situation where fiat in some form will probably stick around for a lot longer than you think it will.

If we are planning on MAYBE making all of these changes at SOME time in the future, why are we hanging onto this dinosaur currency Bitcoin when there is another currency out there that has *already* solved all these problems?  What is wrong with Monero? I'm starting to think that the author of the article is on to something.

And with the MASSIVE commercial mining operations going on now,  it's now among the most centralized cryptocurrencies as far as the mining is concerned.

80% XMR 
20 % BTC &amp; ETH
I'm a big believer in Monero's long game.  I'm not planning on selling for a long, long time.

You should superimpose a graph of the price with it. and scale it so the absolute maxima line up.
(I.E.  0-100% of All time high value) 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:56:47
Pretty funny. In some cases you can tell that increased public interest boosted the price, and in other cases a boost in price prompted increase in the amount of public interest haha.  Thanks for doing that.

right, but Bitcoin is promoted as a digital currency.  ironically enough its own success , the fact that its value is spiking in this ridiculous bubble actually makes it not useful as a currency... because everyone just holds onto it lol :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:13:49
lol, having some reading difficulties?
As I said above, "The majority of all illegal activity **conducted with cryptocurrency** is still done in bitcoin"

If you're going to memorize half of it just memorize the whole thing... It's not exactly a very long string of words.
However I don't recommend trusting your memory with your money especially if you have a lot. Just write it down and keep it safe like a safe deposit box at the bank.

The way I see it, the question you're *really* asking me is whether I think Monero's current all time high will remain its all time high for the foreseeable future, and in my opinion, the answer to that question is absolutely not.  (Edit: case in point, it went up 15% since I made this post last night.  the increase might not be permanent, but there you are.)
As more and more people discover that bitcoin is not anonymous, and companies and governments continue developing algorithms that analyze the blockchain to track transactions, more and more people will flock to Monero, where this blockchain analysis is not possible.
Let me ask you this: when you go to the store and you buy a soda, do you want the lady behind the counter to be able to look at the dollar bill you hand to her, and see not only every single transaction that dollar has been involved in (including who gave it to you), but also every transaction YOU'VE ever done, as well as the current balance in your bank account? Because that's how Bitcoin works, unless you pay 2-3% and use a bitcoin mixer.  This is the result of having a public blockchain.  With Monero you don't need to mix to keep this information private, and nobody can see any of your transactions or your balance, even if they have your public wallet address.
I personally believe that Monero is the future, maybe even surpassing Bitcoin.  Or at the very least, it will be a MUCH bigger piece of the pie than it is now. People are slowly figuring out that Monero is a superior technology in some ways.  
The market cap of Bitcoin is something like more than 50 times as much as Monero.   So if money starts to flow from Bitcoin into Monero, the affect on price will be MASSIVE.
Before you decide one way or another, read this blog piece.  It does a good job of describing the fatal flaw of Bitcoin that will just become more and more obvious as time goes on.

You would ideally have a copy of your seed stored in several secure locations.
And then you would just generate it from the seed using another wallet.

Lol, you saw that?  To be honest, I was mostly joking about that educating the unwashed masses part.  Obviously I believe XMR is superior technology but I know that me posting in r/ bitcoin is not going to change anything.   I just honestly want to understand the point of view of Bitcoin users and why they prefer it over Monero.  See my previous post in r/Bitcoin where I was sincerely asking why people view it as superior to other coins. 
 If I had made my post as a blatant promotion of Monero and criticism of Bitcoin, I would not have gotten as many honest and thought-out replies. Also, simple criticism wasn't my intent.  I have found that if people view you as an opponent, they are more likely to allow their emotions run the show instead of logic, and more people just report or downvote the post instead of contributing, and then the conversation goes nowhere.
_**You proved my point when said yourself that you wish you had checked my post history before you responded.  That's exactly my point, my post history shouldn't matter.  It shows that this sub is closed-minded and infested with a combative atmosphere. the fact that i have to be secretive and hold my cards close to my chest when I bring up the challenges bitcoin faces says a lot!  says that y'all would rather circlejerk and speculate about price than worry yourselves with the nitty-gritty technical details of what, precisely, makes up a useful currency.  And you know what? That's fine.  Monero has our own sub dedicated to this speculative circlejerking called the sub is dedicated to more serious and technical discussion.  Perhaps you guys should implement a similar system.**_
I do believe Monero is superior at being more like digital cash.  I believe monero is everything bitcoin was supposed to be,  but isn't.   
But I honestly do have an open mind about most coins, and I learn a lot from the replies people have to my concerns.

Thank you!  I felt limited by the 300 character title limit...  I wanted to add some more specific constraints... but it's okay!  It allowed people the freedom to take my idea in a wider variety of directions.
I am loving reading all the submissions...  Can't even say how awesome it is seeing my story idea that has been in my head for months finally put on paper by some people with good writing skills. I really hope someone writes a whole book or makes a movie with this premise one day, that would be awesome.
The whole idea of AI being able to generate and use cryptocurrency to pay either other AI or humans to do things for it is frickin awesome in my opinion.

What privacy features do you anticipate will be adopted by bitcoin, and how do you think such drastic changes to the protocol will happen when we can't even agree on very basic things like block size?
Anonymity and privacy are essential for fungibility, I don't see how bitcoin can ever be anonymous or private, seeing as it is established first and foremost as a completely public system.   Its entire infrastructure would have to drastically change from top to bottom somehow.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:20:27
There are PLENTY of things seriously wrong with Bitcoin itself for you to criticize and be totally justified, as long as you can express these concerns correctly and coherently. For example, the fact that your account balance is public information. The fact that everyone you transact with can search your wallet and see every other person you do business with and in what quantity. The fact that as a result of the two previous points it is not a fungible currency, which itself is the source of a slew of additional very serious flaws.
BUT NO... you took the easy way out, the idiot's way out, with a pointless ad-hominem attack directed at the Bitcoin users, which will do *absolutely nothing* to open up people's eyes to the fatal flaws of the bitcoin protocol.
You are a waste of space, OP. People like you fill the air with fog, creating an "us vs. them" mentality in the cryptocurrency conversation, and making it harder for others to have clear debates of ideas in the open air.
People with your lack of intellectual depth actually slow society down when they try to add to the conversation because all you are is a distraction to those of us who are trying to critically analyze ideas and determine their veracity. 
The best way for you to contribute to the crypto conversation might actually be to not contribute anything.

Bitcoin is NOT anonymous.  
Every single transaction is on a PUBLIC ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:34:52
I believe he is arguing that the specific "inherent property", to use your words, which negates bitcoin's fungibility, is that every coin's transaction history is both unique and public, meaning that two bitcoins can, in fact, be easily differentiated from one another.

The ability to "black list" the coins in a wallet related to criminal activity is like marking a pile of $100 bills as used in a criminal transaction.  If you end up with one in your change and spend it at the wrong place, you could get a knock on your door.  That's not a good thing.
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:34:33
It's a win win
@_date: 2019-04-10 23:23:06
There is another coin I am thinking of which is becoming more and more popular on the dark net,  specifically because it is anonymous.   It also happens to be fungible.
If privacy is a spectrum then I would say having your wallet balance and all of its previous transactions publicly viewable is about the least private thing I can imagine.
It's like going to buy a soda and the cashier can see the total in your bank account.
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:33:35
Whew, I'm not the only one.  I was doubting whether I even understood what a bond was by the time I was done reading
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:28:52
This property is called fungibility and bitcoin does not have it. There is no way around the problem
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:27:35
You could just use an anonymous cryptocurrency and not worry about it.
