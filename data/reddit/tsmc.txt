Infrastructure doesn't happen overnight.  The blueprints for "insurance/security" (as you put it it) exist in the current world, and I'm sure there are entities working towards adapting them to the Bitcoin model.
How many did you lose to be so bitter?

Who would call an insurance firm a "central authority" ... why would you infer a corporation insuring BTC is equivalent to a central authority?
Smells like trolling, especially given the username.
Like cash, you have the *choice* in whether you want to hold it in a bank or stuff it in your mattress.  Nothing is going to change the fact that there is no Fed for BTC.

Buffett doesn't invest in things he can't understand.  It's quite clear he doesn't understand Bitcoin past the word "currency".

How do we know the webserver is the bottleneck?

There are most definitely engineers on this planet who can design order books to handle the trading volume on Mt Gox.  Those guys are working on Buttercoin.  That's how they feel they can have the biggest impact.
Find someone else to educate the public about wallet security and develop the consumer-friendly software to do it.  Not the trading engine guys.  That's not their specialty.

Depending on how much USD you're trying to move ... and if you already have a Dwolla account ... you can move USD to CampBX, and buy BTC there, or buy BTC and send it to your Mt Gox address.

Happy to see this come together over the weekend.  Very cool.  Please print these on American Apparel.  Add a URL for the layman, like the new bitcoinquickstart.info ... but not so long and hideous ... maybe just 301 to the quickstart with a memorable domain.

I spend some and play with the rest.  I try to replace what I spend so I always hold a balance.

Are you talking about Mt Gox or simply talking about Bitcoin as if it were Mt Gox?

Hoard some, spend some.  Kind of like savings/checking, no?

The point of Buttercoin is to make a high-speed, high-quality trading engine so these goxlag shennanigans will eventually go away.

If it's the guys behind [ASICMiner]( then there's no reason to believe it's fake.  What do they have to gain?
