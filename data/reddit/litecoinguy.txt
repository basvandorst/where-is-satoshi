@_date: 2014-01-30 11:52:29
The reason is that btcchina administration team not was able to accept direct diposits before for techincal reasons, and huobi, &amp; okcoin and others, already was. 
Btcchina lost market share related to others, and now with direct diposits will have the possibility to re enter in the competition

Perhaps this explains the fxbtc message, because they had a merchants bank account.
More possible option, like in other countries: some banks decide to be bitcoin hostile (in this case china merchan bank), and other not; but a general rule for all the banks, for the comments of huobi, bter, etc... no make sense

Anyone can do an human translation
for google, appears to be a declaration of okcoin and other of btc38,
about problem of january 31th its a false rumour
the same okcoin statement is in their website: 
@_date: 2014-04-08 08:39:07
well i think that its a one more step to see that in 15 april nothing new will happen...
and that rumours only affected some third payment processors pending from december
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:49:18
To do direct diposits was possible ever iin China, and other chinese exchanges are doing it, some from the beginning, others from december
The reason that btc china not does it before is that btcchina administration team not was able to accept direct diposits before for techincal reasons, and huobi, &amp; okcoin and others, already was.
Btcchina lost market share related to others, and now with direct diposits will have the possibility to re enter in the competition
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:36:53
No new info in this report. And no PBOC announcement but private communication with exchanges related third parties withdrawals
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:23:47
Okcoin third part card payments are affected, not wire transfers!
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:00:32

The statement is very complete, and with google translate, you can read that their comercial banks has no any order to shutdown and 15 april rumour is not confirmed. They are only closing third part deposits, and direct wire transfer continue ok.
Also, huobi is going up at this moment, so this confirms that this statement is really, good news
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:31:41

waiting if this guy motive more legal people to appears!
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:37:24
Yet some faults in this article
Btc38.com not closed his doors, only closed fiat deposit and withdrawal temporaly, but its a exchange focused in altcoins, and for example today is the main world exchange between BTC/DOGE 
Okcoin only halted deposits from third party but not direct deposit and withdrawals.
Otherwise seems that the author not difference clearly third part processors in relation to direct partners like commercial bank accounts that are not third parts. Therefore if commercial banks mantain their current relation with exchanges, they will continue with business as usual after april 15th. 
Already Huobi, Okcoin and Btcchina are accepting direct bank deposits from december, after the "first crysis".
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:37:42
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:58:28
Seems that until now, PBOC dont' was so  strict with december ruling
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:53:15
Yet, they are talking of three party (card recharge), not direct transfers.
And the translation not confirm rumour of april 15th but are talking about december rules.
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:51:41
More important is that:
"Huobi indicated that its bank transfer deposit services are now being manually serviced 24 hours a day to ensure customer funds are deposited quickly"
see summary here
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:21:20
okcoin have stopped 3rd parties diposits but not direct transfers
i think that btcchina already adapted to new rules in december and its ok
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:34:24

We need to expand that there are other big exchanges in China and some of them dont have the same diposit problems than btcchina.
Right now Btcchina is the 3rd china exchange. 1st Huobi.com (and first of the world!!) 2on Chbtc.com 3er Btcchina 4rt okcoin
Huobi and chbtc can do diposits all the time.
Important to know all over the world that BTC china is one thing and bitcoin in china its another thing. 
Important also that media show that there are other big exchanges in china and not only BTCchina
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:53:12
China has no banned bitcoin. China has banned third part processor to collaborate with some exchanges.
I think that some light to this question is related that third part processor, have an stricted rules about what can do in china, and this exchanges currently dont enter in this rules.
i have get one post very interesting about this:
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:16:43
Its a specialized site for bitcoins. I don't know at what level they asked directly sources...Could be an organized manipulation action, by some chinese, sending info to media
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:38:26
They get two new party payment processors
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:44:24
Max keiser beginning to covering LTC
Litecoin have some adventatges from bitcoin, for example more decentralized mining and faster...
but the main thing for me, is that 2 strong coins it better than one, for privacity, for backup, and a lot of things. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:14:00
I think that better if you post in litecoin reddit, because here, some people vote against other cryptos...

Yet 5 of the 8 biggese exchange in volume today are chinese. And the 3 biggest are unknown outside of china
About the question of using personal accounts. Perhaps this exchanges are not owned by a corporation but running as a personal bussiness, like in lots of occidental countries you can do business through personal accounts and you pay taxes as individual doing businees, what is totally legal.
Is it?

You can see all his tweets....
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:49:29
As far i understand after reading a lot, there are one technical problem, but bank wire are not banned.
payment processors are automatic and immediaty.
Bankwire has a delay of 24hours, and the exchanges dont have yet the structure to process manually (but can solve it!)
anyway two of the big chinese exchanges are already accepting new diposits
huobi.com 
chbtc.com

Stop disinformation
Bitcoinity is not the good site to see about china
Right now Btcchina is the 3rd china exchange. 
1st Huobi.com (and first of the world!!)

4rt okcoin
Huobi and chbtc can do diposits all the time
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:25:35
Otherwise no disinformation please
Only btcchina and perhaps okcoin blocked diposits. Other big chinese exchanges are accepting diposits and right now has more volume than btcchina.

Btcchina is not China. Fair information is very important for Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:44:15

If finally the news are completely confirmed, they are not so bad
this moves are to restrict 3rd party payment providers is to better guard against money laundering in that money must move from only Chinese accounts into Bitcoin exchanges and visa versa.
Chinese people yet have better exchanges and ways to withdrawal and diposits that the US people, and so, not liquidity problems for the exchanges.

December 16, 2013 afternoon news : Today, a number of central banks pm news began to spread about to stop third-party payment provider payment and clearing services for Bitcoin market, news disseminators say enthusiastically arrange things .
 
In the beginning, most do not believe this rumor , however, due to the large domestic market, the second largest trading okcoin stopped a few days ago , " money paid through " withdrawals feature the afternoon, microblogging issued the following message to authenticate the user as follows :
Weibo user authentication , " Li Wenbo " posted microblogging , has been deleted
Subsequently , another QQ members of the central bank had posted a fake PS notice as follows :
QQ group members who posted sham notice
Xiao Bian open central bank " payment and settlement company ," the page ( did not this news . Rumor has no visible acting in order to do their utmost .
Because in all kinds of superposition , the market began to panic , and some players began selling virtual currency , eventually causing an avalanche effect . Not famous market -bit era ( which is where I Xiaobian this company ) era coins , and instantly fell from two dollars and 0.9 yuan , directly sliced ​​. Although the recovery, but also began malaise, currently stable at 1.5 yuan . Screenshot below:
Similarly, the prime currency of the moment Xiaobian I purchased fell to 16.51 yuan from 22 yuan , 25 yuan to start to let Xiaobian deeply pinched profusely. However, I am , after all, is the day Xiao Bian (nao) Fu (can) iso (wu) intrinsic (yao), not only did the whole cast flesh , but also took the opportunity to copy the one end , at the end of 19.5 and bought a copy of the 3000 yuan , when 20 yuan to sell , but also earned a snack money.
The following is the prime currency plummeted when the screenshot :
It is not clear that the " rumor central bank to stop payment" event is called the dealer waves . But according to Xiao Bian friend preaching , the dealer does have the opportunity to take advantage of significant Xihuo .
Virtual currency investment risk is huge, not only from its own ups and downs in these currencies , but also from the QQ group rumors swirling . Xiao Bian bit era you please customers keep their eyes open , be careful to avoid cross-check again and causing huge losses to be deceived by similar rumors .

We need to expand that there are other big exchanges in China and some of them dont have the same deposit problems than btcchina.
Right now in China. 1st Huobi.com (and first of the world!!) 2on Chbtc.com 3er Btcchina 4rt Fxbtc, 5e Okcoin
Huobi and chbtc can do diposits all the time.
Important to know all over the world that BTC china is one thing and bitcoin in china its another thing.
Important also that media show that there are other big exchanges in china and not only BTCchina
Edit: PBOC not banned bitcoin. Only banned some third parties processors to work with exchanges. My tesis is that the problem is because this three parties like tenpay supports too much level of anonimity.
But Huobi have other new third parties: China Merchants Bank and China Construction Bank".
This banks are owned by the chinese government, perhaps the question is that china wants direct control for this things, and only accepts third parties that can ban anonimity
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:46:40
I think its question of hours....
Chinese exchanges had big sincronization to halt diposits, so i wait also this to readd diposits
Note that China Merchants Bank and China Construction Bank
are owned by chinese government. Perhaps they want have direct control of diposits
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:52:55

but you don't have info about "using personal account of the owner" for me makes more sense, that they are using their business acount like bitstamp, mtgox or btc-e does...
And i think that this is totally legal yet in china
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:22:27
Great! 
I think that Only Btcchina and okcoin has published that not can add diposits at the moment. Their price is below that other chinese exchanges 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:25:26
its a questions of hours that btcchina and okcoin also gets this third party.
note that this banks are banks owned by the chinese government, perhaps the question is that china wants direct control for this things
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:06:28
lovebitcoin, i would be vey happy if you can answer this question
Why chinese exchanges need a three party payment processor to diposit fund?
Other exhanges like bitstamp and mtgox, also bitfinex in hong kong, accepts direct wire transfer after validation, without three party.
Why not in china mainland?
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:45:03
Or perhaps hold and skyrocket like they done for bitcoin from 2011...

anyone can do an human translation?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:57:18
I dont can translate better,
Its only a phrase but seems that huobi.com have get a third party, china construction bank, for diposits in 24 hours
important that huobi its the chinese exchange with more volume last 24 hours: 
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:00:55

Also the CEO of chbtch.com, fxbtc.com and btctrade.com are doing the same?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:20:03
From this coindesk article, i understand that bank transfers without third part, was not an used mecanism by btcchina also before 5 th december. 
the last sentence seems clear:
“That’s where the problem showed up. If we’re not allowed to deal with third party payment companies then they can’t take deposits for us on behalf of customers, and then we have this catch-22 where we can no longer operate our bitcoin exchange as before,” Lee said.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:17:28
any proof of this info? In their website talks that the reason is that they get two third party processors...
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:55:38
One possibilitiy simply is go to hong kong (like bitfinex for instance) and accept $ or money over the world. So chinese need to convert Yuan in dollars, to be part of the market
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:00:23
If finally the news are completely confirmed, they are not so bad (yet people are triyind to make feat saying that exchanges will close, what is totally false)
this moves are to restrict 3rd party payment providers is to better guard against money laundering in that money must move from only Chinese accounts into Bitcoin exchanges and visa versa.
Chinese people yet have better exchanges and ways to withdrawal and diposits that the US people, and so, not liquidity problems for the exchanges.
