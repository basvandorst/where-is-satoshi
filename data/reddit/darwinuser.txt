I think there's going to be a really huge drop. We'll see a steady  improvement right up to 14th followed by sideways movement or even a small dip that transitions into up surge on the 18th to a spike past $16500 to $18000 range. A big dip, a suckers bounce and a cliff edge bottoming out beyond 9 ending up maybe even as low as 6. Hodling saves transaction fees giving me a nice net gain in the year 2037. :D I plan on buying at the bottom, smells like Nasdaq spirit to me. If I'm wrong so be it! I'm happy with my current level of risk but you've gotta go with your reads and gut.

I expect the market manipulation to escalate and correlate with the futures markets CME in particular. It's already well known that in our little unregulated space we've got whales, there's spoofing, wash trading and bots. This is crypto, it's wild west so no surprises there! 
Some interesting things I found whilst digging about.
TL:DR 2014 Lawsuit brought against Duffy, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and other individuals involved in leadership roles at the CME Group. The basis of which was alleging back-handers to look the other way on wash trading and other unethical practices.
"Defendants have entered into clandestine incentive/rebate agreements in established and heavily traded contract markets with favored firms such as DRW Trading Group and Allston Trading, paying up to $750,000.00 per month in one of the most heavily traded futures contracts in the world.  At no time during the Class Period have Defendants voluntarily revealed to the trading public that these material agreements exist in established markets.  Defendants through their lawyers have repeatedly ridiculed the suggestion that clandestine agreements exist.” 
Which is interesting when you go dig deeper. A guy called Luke Hoersten, left Allstop to form Bitnomial Bitcoin Derivatives Exchange in 2015. They're going to be trading on the new CME Bitcoin futures market. Obviously I would never intend to imply any form of impropriety. I wonder how much coin they're hodling?I guess he got very lucky betting on there being a futures market 2 years prior to bitcoin even becoming a thing! What are the odds of something like that? Seems to me it's a pretty small tight knit world in high finance. 
Tread carefully chaps.

I don't pretend to be an expert on the technical aspects but the prospect of atomic swaps is honestly quite staggering. Where that will ultimately take us is honestly a huge topic that I'm not sure anyone can answer right now because it's properly mindblowing stuff. The possible macro ramifications of looking further on from the LTC/BTC research stuff is scifi realities manifest. In terms of the crypto market as a whole it seems to me we're going to see divergent segmentation and possibly from that a convergence towards a more protected singular point of value. That doesn't even touch the surface of the possibilities.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:39:55

I really think that the majority of people on both sides of the political spectrum are looking far too short term at the implications of this. There is already a virtual nation and a framework being of interaction being developed. All sorts of interesting ideas. 
We can't really know where this is going to evolve to but it's going to be a very interesting ride that's only going to get weirder. The potential seeds of new human paradigms are being born on a daily basis right now. If this technology takes off in a big way in the very long term our notions of left and right may not even function well enough to even act as descriptors given a couple of hundred years. 
Mid to short term I'm sure we'll see like minded people from all across the spectrum engaging in social and political structures that suit them be they libertarian, socialist, anarchist or anime fans. Just because the libertarian ideology that spawned this technology was and still is a huge driver in this world the very nature of it doesn't necessarily exclude others from the notions of voluntarism or socialism by means of contractual basis. Who or what will win? What will that really look like as a practical every day reality? What will form the dominant social and economic paradigms? Who the fuck knows!? Certainly I don't claim to.
As for the power bill. It seems to right now that blockchain systems are ultimately incentivized to come as close to zero point as is entirely possible. In that way they are very efficient and that's only ever going to improve. The structures they replace however seem to be by comparison very inefficient. Honestly I would like to see a proper paper on it. Not just an article by some hack or a blogger with blockchain wish fulfillment or some environmental axe grinder. A real tangible economic and environmental impact study preferably from somebody who actually understands wft they're talking about in regards to the technology and its evolution going forward.

Crypto currency is volatile at the best of times and right now is peak insanity. Up, up, up, nobody really knows how to value it or where or when or if it will stop. If you're going to do it treat it like gambling and emotionally say goodbye to the cash like it never existed in the first place. Sometimes you've just got to have a punt.

Take a look at some live market charts from coinergy or tradingview and understand what all the components in the view mean. When you've done that time to hit the books and get some of the basics of charting. Honestly a lot of all that stuff is noise. There really are no crystal balls or magic numbers or special formulas. Yet those techniques are a very good tools with which to frame possibilities with. Then it's nuts and bolts, figuring out things like transaction fees, exchange rates and so on as all that stuff has an impact on your bottom line.

I think it's a bit pretty valid opinion. The whole crypo market looks very similar to the halcyon days Nasdaq past and that's pretty scary really. There's a decent amount of parallels to give some pretty serious consideration to as well as all the other possible crypto specific icebergs out there.
If it's not a bubble then great! I got in early enough that having to get skin in the game isn't a choice I need to make and honestly It's not one I'd want to make today. I'm happy with taking a very longterm view and I'm quite happy with my current level of risk. I'm so confident on the future of Bitcoin and crypto  I wouldn't mind a crash at all as I'd be happy to gobble up some of those cut price Scooby snacks.
Bitcoin might take dent but will recover. We'll lose a lot of weak junk ICOs and what's left of the market will become healthier and more stable going forward.

Far from a guru but I think Ethereum is a very decent buy at the current price. I don't think it's going to rise anywhere like bitcoin is going to right now but if you're looking to hold as a long term investment I think looking 2/3 years down the line as the technology and adoption rate improves it has potential to be giant. Sure it's risky but that's the nature of the beast.

I'll give you the same advice I would if you were starting to learn how play poker. If you can't afford to lose the money then don't do it. If you do decide to then set your expectations low and accept that walking away with nothing is a possibility. 
There are big swings, it's just the way it is with crypto. Hopefully they'll settle down as time goes on but really In 5 years it'll still be regarded as volatile compared to most other things less so than now but still volatile. If you want to do it then look at it as a long term value bet. If you think there's value there over that period take a punt. I personally think there's value in it but whatever you do don't take my or anyone else's word for it. Do your homework and make your own informed choice.

I have a great deal of confidence in the mid and long term prospects for bitcoin even if there is a correction ahead.

I wouldn't worry. All this short term speculation is a going to be a tiny blip given when we're looking back in five or ten years. By then the market will be way less volatile and with luck the true value will be actualized as a value store in a similar manner as gold.

It has been very interesting to watch that interaction. It seems in part because ether isn't yet all it can be in terms of functionality and the market being and caught between old and new paradigms. 
I'm fairly sure further down the line we'll start seeing divergence from it. Watch out for it when it happens as get the feeling a lot of people will be really caught off guard.
