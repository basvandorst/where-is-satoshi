Why not solve the problem up front, and increase the chance of bitcoin surviving?
Its true about changing one variable. But best/worst case scenario we need 10000tps+ At this tiem the blockchain will grow with 10000tps/7tps*10MB(?)/second. At this point its 1.4GB/10min = 205 GB/24hr
At this point I am afraid only large corporation will be able to keep the blockchain running, and much of the decenteralized structure of bitcoin will dissolve.
I am not to afraid about increasing the transaction/second cap. I am afraid of a blockchain growing to fast.
No one knows how to create a protocol that will go through its own code to remove unnessesary data?
sorry, no spell check on this computer :/

I am talking about it takes 60 minuts before a transactions is confirmed, 6 blocks / 10 min each. If I buy a cup of coffee in a store, how awkward would that be.
Its already awkward waiting for my VISA when it takes more than 7 seconds....

Well, at least its good to sea I am not the only person who feels bad about the word bit.
I think its better to make up names, Satoshis is already there. Maybe 100 Satoshis could be a Dorian or something.

If they are working on it that would be great.
But if they been working on it for years, but are still unable to fix this issue, then that just worries me even more.
I am not a programmer, I have no idea how difficult such a problem is.
Satoshi, come back, we need you...

You don´t understand economics or bitcoin.

What was invented two years ago thats better than bitcoin?

Very interesting post!
You are right that I am confused about how the bitcoin protocoll works. To me its just a bunch of synchronized ledgers.
These ideas should be implemented in the scalability page at bitcoin wiki. Maybe they are now? they were not when I checked 6 months ago.

People who are up for the challange should create a bounty for them self. Buy 100 BTC, fix scalability issues, sell at 5x original price.
Its just annoying seeing what is potensially great technology with an akilles heal down the road.

Thank you for your reply.
I did not create a ticket on it, but its already back up running like usual.
Had to be a temporary glitch.
