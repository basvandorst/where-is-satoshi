Except you're still misusing terms. The government doesn't enforce common ownership under socialism, rather, worker syndicates abduct power from the government. You're using the term "common ownership" loosely and informally, where I'm using it to refer to a specific technical concept.
The reason many governments are nominally socialist is because those countries had legitimate, large-scale people's uprisings and worker movements that were ultimately crushed. You're misinformed because of cold war era propaganda, unfortunately. However it's all on Wikipedia, if you ever decide to seriously investigate the topic. To have a persuasive argument, you should fully appreciate the opposite perspective.

Google the definition of communism please

While that definition isn't wrong, it is extremely dumbed down and you are misunderstanding it. More precisely, socialism (or synonymously, communism) is an economic system characterised by the common ownership of the means of production.

"Means of production" include things like natural resources and large factories.
Common ownership means the government doesn't own it, it means "the people" own it. There are different ways to accomplish this, a commonly proposed way is via [worker syndicates]( They are a theoretically sound way of allowing workers to maintain power, while keeping it decentralised and stable.
Any system in which the government owns everything is generally referred to as [state capitalism]( and is not a form of socialism, since the means of production is not democratically controlled. Russia, China and Venezuela are not socialist states, because trade unions or worker syndicates do not control the means of production, government does. People who claim these states are socialist states are not informed, and are generally people who you shouldn't take seriously.
