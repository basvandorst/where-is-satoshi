This is a terrible idea.  Reddit has already found its niche as a site for infotainment on your phone/computer when you have downtime at work or free time in general.  It's not a community.  It never will be.  It's an aggregation website.  The people who come here are primarily teenagers and neckbeards who would want nothing to do with any sort of IRL interaction.
You have a good point about the overloaded servers though.  They need to get on that.

Assuming "the rest of their lives" is some indefinite (i.e. infinite) amount of time.  If a person only wants to live to 75, they can have $250,000 and spend about $2000/month.  With social security doubling that, you're looking at $4000/month with very low taxes.  You probably already have property, a vehicle, and all the assets necessary for life.  Medicare can even cover health insurance.  That would still be a pretty comfortable life.

The bad ratings were always the real reason for the collapse.  Brokers will always try to pass off bad securities as good ones.  Just like the used car salesman will try to pass off a junker as an awesome diamond in the rough.  Selling shit and calling it gold is a major component of capitalism in general.  
But the people who were mislabeling the ratings for the various tranches of the CDOs were not merely engaging in shady sales practices, that was by definition, fraud.

I'm pretty sure the FBI also invented drugs.

I guess you could stay that the story... had no climax.
