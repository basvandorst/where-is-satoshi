Oh, please. What you're saying may be technically true, no real way of knowing. That being said, you know damn well that people were up in arms about the immigration issue LONG before healthcare reform passed, long before Obama was even a candidate.

Sounds like the set up of a trashy, torture-porn horror movie.

on a PC? look up the Unicode.  if you're on ios, go into keyboard settings and create a shortcut that will replace "btc" with "฿ ". not sure what to do if you're on android, but there's probably a similar setting somewhere.

You've ALL handled my asspennies!

Well, they have my "no" vote.

฿ is, but it would be nice to have to have the double lined version

Please provide a source for this.

Thought it was pretty even handed.  Stewart was a bit dismissive, but at least they blamed Gox instead of bitcoin itself. (Unlike some other media figures.) Quite enjoyed how he pointed out that much greater shenanigans go down in the traditional banking system.

Thanks.  Didn't see source info for this. Hopefully this is a non issue that will resolve when bitstamp is fixed.

That sounds plausible. How does one find out where they get their info?
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:43:24
Hmm good to know. What are you using? Maybe it's an iPhone thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:17:34
That still works, but as of a few days ago you could enter something like "$20 to btc" and it would convert. Now it says "wolfram alpha doesn't know how to interpret your input."  Just tried from a pc browser too, same story.

Can we please stop with the Alex jones posts? For or against, his name coming up during the average person's research will do nothing to help bitcoin.
