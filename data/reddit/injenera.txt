Why do you care about BTC's value in fiat? Isn't BTC's purpose to replace fiat?

That's what I call adoption!

Yeah, keep pouring money into that dying unregulated junk

I just don't believe anyone can do anything bad with my info. It's not difficult to obtain it without my consent anyway I guess. In my job I work with the data of thousands of people from all over the world and if there was a way I could profit off it, I'd be the first to do that :)

@_date: 2019-01-16 14:07:13

 Honestly, controlling your own secret key (essentially being your own bank) is not for everyone. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:29:53
Yeah, still better

Why is the price $9200 on WEX? What does that mean?
