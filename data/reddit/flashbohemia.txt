you're fucking insane.

I honestly hope you don't get your money back.

Did you make this account just so you could shit all over Bitinstant?
@_date: 2013-06-15 00:48:27
Funny how immediately you shut the fuck up when people start receiving their bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:42:23
then chill the fuck out.

They can't fucking predict the price of bitcoin. It could have just as easily went up.

you mean, someone should pay their office a "visit"...

You do realize people are getting their coin now? I'm sure they're refraining from giving you yours for as long as possible, since the past 3 days all you've been is an obsessive bitch. and by the way, Bitinstant is probably the quickest way to get bitcoin. Any other way would take a few days. Is that a scam? You're ridiculous and you don't deserve Bitinstant's fine services.

Just stop. They had issues when their new site launched. Just because they're incompetent doesn't mean they're trying to scam us.
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:50:01
I just got my coin.

They fucked me too man. Right now I'm out $200. Nothing better to do than to wait for them to get it right. They're not just going to forget about all the orders. You seriously comment on every post about Bitinstant. I promise time would go by a lot faster if you didn't cruise just so you can bash them.
