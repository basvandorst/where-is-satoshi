Sorry, I don't understand. You are saying that you can't exceed the total capacity which with the second sequence example above, you are clearly violating that?

Thanks, I get it now :)

No, it's a way to make ez money.

If I understand the `addwitnessaddress` command correctly, the resulting address should point to same coins as the non-witness address? Right? So if derive a new segwit address from an existing address (multisig P2SH) and use that address further on for future transactions, it should be sufficient to call this an upgrade to segwit? I simply want to "re-use" my "old" addresses so I don't have to sent all my coins (lots of coins) to new segwit-addresses.

Basically, it has integrated error-correction/checksum.

    # Release 3.0 - Uncanny Valley (November 1st, 2017)
      * The project was migrated to Python3 and Qt5. Python2 is no longer
        supported. If you cloned the source repository, you will need to
        run "python3 setup.py install" in order to install the new
        dependencies.
      * Segwit support: 
        - Native segwit scripts are supported using a new type of
          seed. The version number for segwit seeds is 0x100. The install
          wizard will not create segwit seeds by default; users must
          opt-in with the segwit option.
        - Native segwit scripts are represented using bech32 addresses,
          following BIP173. Please note that BIP173 is still in draft
          status, and that other wallets/websites may not support
          it. Thus, you should keep a non-segwit wallet in order to be
          able to receive bitcoins during the transition period. If BIP173
          ends up being rejected or substantially modified, your wallet
          may have to be restored from seed. This will not affect funds
          sent to bech32 addresses, and it will not affect the capacity of
          Electrum to spend these funds.
        - Segwit scripts embedded in p2sh are supported with hardware
          wallets or bip39 seeds. To create a segwit-in-p2sh wallet,
          trezor/ledger users will need to enter a BIP49 derivation path.
        - The BIP32 master keys of segwit wallets are serialized using new
          version numbers. The new version numbers encode the script type,
          and they result in the following prefixes:
             * xpub/xprv : p2pkh or p2sh
             * ypub/yprv : p2wpkh-in-p2sh
             * Ypub/Yprv : p2wsh-in-p2sh
             * zpub/zprv : p2wpkh
             * Zpub/Zprv : p2wsh
          These values are identical for mainnet and testnet; tpub/tprv
          prefixes are no longer used in testnet wallets.
        - The Wallet Import Format (WIF) is similarly extended for segwit
          scripts. After a base58-encoded key is decoded to binary, its
          first byte encodes the script type:
             * 128 + 0: p2pkh
             * 128 + 1: p2wpkh
             * 128 + 2: p2wpkh-in-p2sh
             * 128 + 5: p2sh
             * 128 + 6: p2wsh
             * 128 + 7: p2wsh-in-p2sh
          The distinction between p2sh and p2pkh in private key means that
          it is not possible to import a p2sh private key and associate it
          to a p2pkh address.
      * A new version of the Electrum protocol is required by the client
        (version 1.1). Servers using older versions of the protocol will
        not be displayed in the GUI.
      * By default, transactions are time-locked to the height of the
        current block. Other values of locktime may be passed using the
        command line.

You can always `git checkout` the tagged release branch ;)
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:45:53
Or clone the git repository and build it yourself.

The error correction algorithm is pretty much amazing.
Having error correction in bitcoin addresses will for sure have advantages:
