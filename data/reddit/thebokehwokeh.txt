At this point it's looking like it'll only turn green once we hit 4 figures.

That's BTC futures, which isn't pegged to BTC in any way shape or form. This is a way for chickenshit investors to have some BTC exposure without actually owning a piece of the blockchain.

Go to r/bitfinex and see for yourself. I should’ve done that too and here I am, in withdrawal limbo.

Stay away from bitfinex.
I have been waiting 40+ hours to withdraw an altcoin and they are close to insolvency.
They are the new mt gox

The only reason people use fiat is because it is stable enough to buy things with. I can be sure that, at least within a year, the brand new Honda Civic I'm looking at is probably  around USD 17k, and will be thereabouts next year. I cannot ever see that happening with bitcoin. I would likely have to time the exact point where the 1 BTC it's being sold at is at its perceived lowest value, or else I lose a ton of money buying.
"Not even 2% of the world is in bitcoin" is true. But with the wild valuation swings and rapid gains and losses depending on the time frame you came in, how can you expect to get to a point where people to jump in en masse and start using it as a currency? 
You need it to be stable but it'll never be stable unless it reaches critical mass, and it'll never reach critical mass until people stop treating it like a security and trading it on exchanges.
Bitcoin and all things blockchain are, in my eyes, a failed social experiment. The idea had promise. A digital gold, like in the old days. But like in the old days, only the first prospectors became the kings of their domain. 
It was never the medium that was the problem. It's humanity's greed.

Let's hear it. What is deflation @_date: 2013-11-27 23:16:09
As someone looking into hopping on the bandwagon, this was extremely enlightening.
It seems that because of the finite market cap, it's unrealistic to expect bitcoin to be a USD or GBP or EURO in the future, but as a store of value for those, essentially what gold or silver is today.
