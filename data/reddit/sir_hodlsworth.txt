Congrats! I must respectfully say this photo is oddly terrifying

Son, I've thought about it for awhile, and you'll need to finish your chores before I give you that $197

Guilty. My day consists of reading through Reddit subs, listening to crypto podcasts/books, and scanning Twitter for crypto related things. I’m obsessed. And it feels like pure enjoyment.

We're in the dial-up internet phase of this technology. Never have I been more excited about the future

And look how far we’ve come. Imagine what 4 more years could bring

The SHA 256 algorithm used by BTC and others can be upgraded. this is likely to be a slow and drama filled process. There are some projects working to address this now- Quantum Resistant Ledger is the one I’m most familiar with. They use an Extended Merkle Signature Scheme algo (XMSS) that is provably resistant to a computer running Shor’s algorithm.

So this is “Satoshi’s vision” so many are referring to. I like it

An important distinction needs to be made here: I'm not sure many people in the sub are begging for the ETF, the bottom line is (taking emotions out of the equation), the ETF news is going to have an effect on the price. As a retail investor currently putting money towards Bitcoin long term, it's absolutely in my best interest to know everything I can find out about the ETF saga unfolding in order to make effective investment decisions. I'm getting tired of people on this sub freaking out about how we don't need ETFs and how it goes against what Bitcoin is about. Regardless of how you "feel" or your opinion on the ETF, it's a significant step towards legitimizing BTC as a store of value and new asset class available to the entire world, including Wall Street. So stuff all your "feelings" about the ETF in a sack, buy the dips, and buckle up for the ride.

You are completely missing the point I am making. It does not matter what I think or what you think about the ETF or what "legitimacy" it could potentially provide or not provide. The sole point I'm conveying is all the news about the ETF is going to have an EFFECT ON the PRICE OF BITCOIN. And as a retail investor I could stand to get more BTC with my shitty fiat dollars if I learn things about the market and it's happenings and cycles (ex. ETF). Everyone gets so caught up in this "Us vs. Them" mentality around the world in so many different areas of life. It's honestly a waste of time. I'm here to learn, support BTC and projects I believe in, accumulate BTC, and hopefully one day accumulate wealth. Everything else is a waste of time. Good day sir.
