How do you "lose" a Bitcoin? This is what confuses me. If you have a Bitcoin wallet and keep it there then it should be safe? Are they only lost in transactions?

I thought one if the points of Bitcoin is that the government can't really do much about it? 
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:01:21
Okay, that makes sense. Thank you!

I have BTC on Coinbase, they are having delays with transactions. I know before the split people were encouraged to get their BTC off Coinbase before it happened. I should I get mine off there now or wait for the transaction delays to be resolved?

I am, haha, but I'm obsessing about the price and when to buy again lol. I think I'm just going to buy every week for now so I don't go crazy 
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:38:57
I bought at $4300 feelsbadman, it's $4035 right now RIP. What are people thinking it will be by the end of 2017?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:28:07
Thanks for the reply, it's making me feel better about it. I guess I just kinda goes against my instinct. I guess I just imagined, what if a hack happened and people's SSNs get stolen. I'm young and new to banking and investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:08:56
Okay, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:18:13
Thank you! That makes sense, I'm just worried right now it's a bit of FOMO and people are buying like crazy and soon there will be a correction. Every time I've thought don't buy, I've regretted it though
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:10:10
Can anyone explain to me why BTC is on such a bull run right now and doesn't seem to be slowing down? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:44:54
Interesting, so when I try again, should I leave the page up for the day and wait to see if it gets confirmed or can I close it and logout? I've already signed off after getting denied tonight.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:27:54
Okay, yeah that makes sense. I hope I didn't come off as anti free market or pro redistribute the wealth. Now that I've gotten a lot more information, everything is starting to make more sense. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:39:48
 Not really. I have 2 bank accounts and a debit card. The only job I've had was working as a hockey referee. Other than that, I don't think I do.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:31:09
I don't think they are but I could be wrong. I do know that my hardware wallet is set up for SegWit. I don't really care for Coinbase, but they have been easy to use.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:08:49
Okay, makes sense! Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:53:07
Thank you! Interesting, I haven't heard of him until today. I will be checking him out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:25:18
Okay, thank you. I've been reading trying to figure out what's been going on buts it's been pretty confusing. Also, if you don't mind answering, who exactly is Roger Ver and why is he doing this?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:52:43
Yeah, I'm trying to! Just a ton of information I'm getting right now. I feel like what's happening now prevents a lot of people from jumping in. I know that crypto is still very new so it's going to be volatile and subject to a lot of change but it still feels overwhelming at times.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:38:46
So isn't kind of a bad thing that so few people own so much? Can't they, in a way, control it?
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:36:48
Thank you for the reply! I do have another question, if you don't mind answering. About two months back I heard there was some security glitches or something with trezor. What was that about? Should I be concerned buying one now?
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:14:16
Thank you for the reply and information! I will take a look at it!
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:03:21
Thanks for the advice! I am planning on HODLing. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:16:46
Okay, thank you! I have the breadwallet on a device that would be solely for that. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:05:46
I was thinking about ordering it now and because of the wait use something like breadwallet in the meantime. Thanks for the reply 
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:45:22
Been here for a few months reading as much as I can. I don't have any BTC yet because it's still kind of intimidating but I'm fascinated by it. I'm constantly watching it and trying to learn as much as I can about it. Love this idea, I will definitely pass on the love in the future. I'm already talking to relatives and a few close friends about it!
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:44:56
So what's this mean if I have them on breadwallet? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:22:22
Whoa, dang, that's a lot of bad experiences. I don't think I'll be using Coinbase anymore. �� I hope Gemini is better or I'll find another if it's not
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:11:41
I do not. I only have the debit card as I am 20 years old and that's all I've needed so far in life. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:57:47
I was looking at that as well. Right now if I buy a Nano S from Ledger it won't ship until September 4th. I could get one from Amazon but they're $185 compared to €58. It looks like I could buy the trezor and get it relatively fast for €89.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:16:03
Okay, thank you!
