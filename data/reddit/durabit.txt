LTC, DOGE and ETH aren't used for payments anywhere. I'm not bashing them at all - but other than Bitcoin, no coin is accepted for payments.
Accepting XMR on the dark markets would be a big deal for Monero and would set it apart from Bitcoin as well as other alts that aren't used as fungible cash today.

You can answer that question yourself. When was the last time a dark market accepted anything else besides Bitcoin? LTC has been around forever...can you name an accepting merchant running on Tor or I2P?
I'm not saying that Monero is going to take over, but yes I am saying that this situation is different.

Bytecoin was an innovation - it's a cryptocurrency based on Cryptonote, not Bitcoin unlike most of the other copycat coins. However, Bytecoin wasn't launched fairly - quite the opposite, it's very likely that it was launched with a 'fake' accelerated blockchain history.
XMR/Monero is a fair launch based on Cryptonote with 1000+ code updates. Feel free to hate on altcoins but at least understand the history of what you're bashing.

Ha...marketing team. I think that out of the top 20 listed on Coinmarketcap, Monero might have the least amount of 'marketing' effort. Right now, this is the cutting edge of privacy, fungibility and secrecy. Bitcoin may eventually gain some or all of these features, but if you want to transact privately today, Monero is working and available.

I generally agree with your post but let's get into what you mean by "long term" because long term the mostly likely scenario is that BTC is worthless as it's replaced by superior technology as well.
Sidechains: Federated today, when do you expect to have a truly functioning sidechain that doesn't require trusting a bunch of individuals with keys to spend your wealth?
Mimblewimble-esque: Whitepaper this month, tech will be available...? Proven? Running as a separate chain or sidechain (see above)?
Monero: All transactions are mixed. All transactions are stealth. When will that apply to *all* Bitcoin transactions? If not anytime soon, then I think it's reasonable to see Monero having value for a lengthy period of time to come.

Nope, the Winklevoss ETF specifically states: "The Trust will not insure its Bitcoins."

I think there's plenty of evidence that points toward Bytecoin being unfairly launched. If you disagree, you're welcome to hold it and try to convince dark markets to accept it.

Institutional investors have compliance departments to contend with. Can a trader overrule compliance? Absolutely. Is investing in Bitcoin worth dealing the repercussions of losing money due to other issues than market risk? I would argue likely not. Few traders would  possibly sacrifice their career by either holding BTC directly or through an exchange and then dealing with the fallout if the BTC get stolen/lost/etc.
An ETF resolves counterparty risk almost entirely. It's a big deal.

Sidechains whitepaper came out in Oct 2014. Pegged sidechains will be available when? Until then, federated sidechains are far, far weaker than using a separate altcoin chain. At any given time the locked BTC can be stolen by the keyholders making the entire sidechain value worthless.

OKCoin International always charged fees as opposed to the Beijing based OKCoin/BTCC/Huobi companies that didn't charge fees on much of their trading.

Technically it's OKCoin International which is based in Singapore as opposed to OKCoin which is based in China. Also, the index is volume and price variance weighted so if OKCoin is significantly off from GDAX, Bitfinex, etc it'll have a minimal effect on the Tradeblock's index price.
