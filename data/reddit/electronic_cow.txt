I wired the funds from my personal checking account.  My personal checking, savings, AND credit cards were closed.
The picture in the OP just so happens to be my credit card.  I should have posted this picture to be more clear:

Under $400, one time, wired to Poland

I have a mortgage with Chase Bank as well.  I was told by a Chase branch manager &amp; Chase phone rep supervisor it would not be effected.
I can see it listed in the same account home page as my closed accounts.

I had the Chase Freedom card and it was my alternate credit card, spending roughly $200/mo on things like gas and food.  Never any out-of-country charges or anything "weird".

They gave me a few weeks warning for all the closures, yes.

Original post was a letter regarding my Chase credit card, however they also closed my checking and savings.  The only reason they gave was I was a risk.
I thought long and hard, and the riskiest thing I've done was wire money to Mt. Gox 11 months ago.
* The amount was under $400, wired to Poland, one time.
* I didn't wire the funds using the credit card.  It was from my personal checking, which was also closed: 
* I have a mortgage with Chase that I'm told will be unaffected

Correct, and you're right:  not the case here.  I wouldn't fault them for closing a troublesome/risky account.

Nope!  Never got into that.  Too much work and I don't fly enough.
