Ummm, but they are going down because people aren't using it......

Oh ya it does.

Oh good, nothing like a nice subside to get a new industry off to a good start. I'm sure that will never cause problems in the future.

Umm, well Ethereum's own lightning network (Raiden) actually already works...

Umm, that stuff has nothing to do with Ethereum core. Parity, who made the multisig wallet,  is a 3rd party developer completely separate from the foundation.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:44:03
Ya, and that molasses place of development seems to be backfiring....

I've been involved with Ethereum since 2015, but thanks for the history reminder. The correct decision was made, but I'm sure you guys will FUD talk us the entire time as you descend down the path of irrelevancy.

Great, I'll be sure to remember all this when sitting next to my mansion pool.

What? That sounds like second hand gossip spread by a 70 year old grandma.

EEA3 was announced, so ETH is currently mooning. Gdax could not handle the volume apparently.

Wow, we got a real Miss Cleo over here.

They are like Hillary supporters the week before the election. Don't worry guys, Bitcoin is going to win for sure!
