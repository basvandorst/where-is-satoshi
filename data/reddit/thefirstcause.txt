While that is true, they've been down for a long time now, not like this new 'unknown' is just swapping them out. I was really disgusted by their attitude about the whole 51% thing. Pretty much 'we aren't going to do a thing, we are successful and shouldn't be punished for it, we are the victims here. ' instead of being responsible for the sake of Bitcoin and their own company. Now look at where they are.

Obviously no way to tell if you are the actual person. Why bother being 'purposefully harsh' and going on about scam this and that? Why not just give him informed criticism so he can take a balanced approach?  It has been a tough year for bitcoin... so? There have been other tough years. I've been in BTC since 2011, I can't stand drugs myself and buy electronics and videogames with my bits. Beyond a couple friends, I'm the worst bitcoin promoter ever. I've also watched it grow and grow after every bear correction.

LOL sensitive and jumping to conclusions much? I didn’t say there was anything wrong about asking questions, I even said that it could be an NSA troll (as recently revealed!! ffs) but I was willing to give the person the benefit of the doubt instead of going witchhunt on his/her ass without more information. The persons message was polite, and guess what, there are people on this planet that are decent people and don’t like bitcoin for whatever reasons, visionless and ignorant as they may be. Flipping out on critics can make noobs question if maybe those critics calling us scammers are right. I think your reading comprehension skills are shamefully bad.

The price fell because that is what is normal after such a sharp, violent increase in price. The market needed a correction as it always has. It fell from $32 in June 2011 to $2 in November 2011. People thought it was over! Then of course $260 to $50 in the spring summer of 2013. The market is bigger now so it makes sense for the correction to take longer plus the terror of MtGox and endless China bans.

That person sounds like a decent individual that simply doesn't understand Bitcoin whatsoever or doesn't have the skill, instincts or knowledge to understand what makes Bitcoin so special. The warning seems to come from a place of real empathy and kindness. Of course one could go full NSA conspiracy and say it is one of their paid trolls (as recently revealed) but I'll take it at face value. Glad you are able to see the innovation and value. Hopefully, if you are interested in it as an investment/savings  you can amass enough bits have a big return on investment in the future like... 5-10 years future. Yes the last year has been a downtrend, but there have been other year long bear periods also, followed by massive growth. End of 2011, through all of 2012 sucked, but start of 2013 was incredible.  Good luck with whatever your plans are

The media have been working up their nerve to shit all over bitcoin again. 2013 year shut them down and embarrassed a lot of journalists who'd been taking shits on Bitcoin for years. Every correction is the same, they always rip it to shreds, but last year, and even this year they have been quiet. Now that the correction has been a year long they are sharpening the knives with the 400th 'i told you so' that will they just embarrass them again soon enough.

Im not a troll, can't stand beartrolls, but I believe the wounds have just started. The streets will be bloody after the war, and the war may only be starting. Bitcoin pretty much always tests the old ATH (254ish this time) before finally ending its beartrends. We may very well go down to that level. I will personally be buy in that zone if we get there.

The price is dropping because it is still correcting from last falls super spike. It might have corrected faster if we hadn't had the 4000 'China bans' and MtGox die. The fact that the market is far bigger now also means corrections might take longer than they did in the smaller market cap days.

Bitcoin is acknowledged by the IRS as an investment. Get the cops involved, heck, even go tell him you are getting the cops involved, and that he stole an investment from your.

They should be greedy, smart greedy and want their BTC to actually have value. Right now there are a lot or REALLY STUPID GREEDY miners on ghash. They need to keep the greed, lose the stupid, or the stupid will destroy the source of their revenue. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:43:18
I personally suggest just buying. Mining is incredibly difficult now with the mining arms race and multi million dollar corporations doing nothing but mining 24/7. By the time someone gets up and running with a miner system, the miner corps have already made it obsolete via manufacturing their own tech and using it themselves. I've been in Bitcoin four years now and simply never bother with mining because of the arms race aspect.

Which in turn could increase scarcity somewhat. If many people are simply passing the tips around, loading up on more btc to continue tipping, and never converting back to USD, there will be less and less to buy on exchanges. Of course those buying products from shops that use bitpay won't help with that, but enough people tipping and holding BTC without converting to fiat could be interesting.

Of course it rises! =) It has climbed from cents four years ago to over $1000 all time high last year. Along the way it has had numerous spikes in price followed by sometimes long drawn out doubt inducing corrections. I'm confident it will rise again significantly. The Microsoft news is huge though I don't think it will automatically make the price rise just yet. Could be a couple more months of down first.
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:36:57
I filled all these out a couple weeks ago. They were very helpful, polite, and understood it was a hassle for me. They even let me complete a transfer they had halted before I completed everything since it was going to take a couple more days to gather information.

Investing in high risks assets pays off immensely when it works. The thing is you must to have the vision and sense to know when something is a good buy, and when something is just a garbage penny stock. Bitcoin has acted like a penny stock with its volatility because of limited supply and small marketcap, but it is also an incredible innovation that many compare to the beginning of the internet. I see that as a very good high risk asset.

Mining isn't the way for people fresh to Bitcoin to get into it. You need extremely specialized and expensive equipment and must pay for a lot electricity.

You haven't been in it long enough. Been doing this four years now. This is nothing, it has done worse and done way way way better.

Just like in politics, pure 100% democracy doesn't really work, you need leaders who can listen to talented advisers, be a damn leader and make decisions. This person shouldn't be a god who can do anything with Bitcoin... but they should be able to keep things moving forward. Perhaps this person is elected by the other core devs, they get to be leader for a while, then they have to step down. 100% decentralized "we will just figure it out by talking forever" isn't really human nature. People will always disagree, everyone wants to be 'the genius' who figures things out, everyone wants their ideas to take priority, you need a person at the top to filter it all and actually get work done.

She compares Bitcoin to 'something that would've been on Star Trek' like it is some crazy fantasy thing. Someone needs to inform her that many things on Star Trek are no longer science fiction but science reality, lol.

Exactly, even replicators are on the way in early stages with 3D printing, maybe even more so down the line with advanced nanotech.

Yes, her point essentially was 'by regulating we legitimize, so how about we leave it alone and let it die.'

I've also had my BTC not hitting the blockchain from MtGox for over 24 hours. Way more than 50btc too.

Times are changing. As the Google Play store continues to grow in popularity, and it is, devs should make more money on Android. This also isn't about developers anyway, if Apple is censoring it makes no damn difference, Android is the ONLY option so embrace it and help force Apple to evolve or die. Screw Apple on this issue (I'm writing this on a macbook pro, I have no loyalty to any company or product, and will use what I view as best at any given time.)

I've owned multiple iPhones, but the easy solution is to use Android. Android is the VHS tape, iPhone is the BETA tape. Good quality, but iPhone marketshare is shit now compared to Android, and Google won the war by allowing everyone to use their OS and continuing to innovate. iOS7 hilariously rips Android now just like Microsoft used to rip off Apple back in the day.

The news about Fidelity is like 20 hours old anyway, this isn't some big horrible news as them allowing investments from IRA's been public for less than a day!.The company didn't even know their clients were doing it and they want to review what the hell was happening internally. They said they will review and consider things. What FUD, and I'm not even a perma bull, I like cheap coins.

If bitcoin captures only a tiny 1% of FOREX market it will be worth a minimum of $100,000 per coin because of the built in 21 million bitcoin limit. If bitcoin is successful there will be many new billionaires created. 200k isn't all that unreasonable mathematically... as long as Bitcoin is successful of course. =)

Yes, that was pretty fun and it was a great way to end things off with his positive outlook.

A fantastic first step. Cautious but positive.
