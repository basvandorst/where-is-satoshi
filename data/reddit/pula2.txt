And you're adding value to this forum by acting ,,maturely "?
Everyone has the right to opinion ( unless you live in Russia ex.) , faggots state their opinion, I state mine and you state yours but I don't really give a damn about yours or theirs.
Bitcoin is going to rise, faggots will cry and you will come back to this post trying to act ,,maturely " again and again nobody will give a fuck.
If you don't like the post don't click on it boy.

You were the one to reply first not me.
You consider me beeing a embarrassment and I'm ok with that because I don't take your opinion into consideration.I might have bought at the wrong time but it's not like you could predict the future in order judge me for buying at the wrong time, did you know when it was the wrong time,did you bought at the right time?
Seems like you're an Oracle...well then make this forum better Mr.Oracle and help people buy at the right time,thank you so much Mr.Oracle.

Like a lot of people I was just attracted by the concept and decided to invest most of my money ( yes I don't really afford to loose) and maybe to make a profit but this wasn't the only reason.
I know 90% of you will say it's stupid but it is what it is...
If I would sell them I would loose a lot but if it goes back into 250-300 Mark and I've sold them at 190 I would be even more pissed...idk
