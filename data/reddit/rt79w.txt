The only way to understand bitcoin is to think of it as a form of exchange and not a form of value.

Is calling someone a bot the best way for you to avoid reality?
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:43:29
doubt it
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:41:53
Who cares about how much it is worth? What an old world way of looking at it.
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:27:11
Because this community isn't geared towards the success of Bitcoin.

Tax is a crime.

The blockchain can actually be used for voting, and can be super secure since you can tie blockchain addresses to devices like smartphones. So, if each users smartphone is tied to a specific address then you can verify that people are voting and who for, and the best part is it can be anonymous and prevents people from casting fake votes. You may say that someone can just buy multiple phones, but you can always limit it too active phone numbers. I am sure more needs to be worked out but it can work.

What a negative outlook, shame really.
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:49:23
Definitely a need for a good one.
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:09:13
You offered nothing constructive in return, so yes it is negativity. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:01:22
Ethereum is not Bitcoin so it isn't the same at all.
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:28:49
This community is not designed to promote Bitcoin, it is only designed to promote division among Bitcoin.

I can't even get it to work, not that great.
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:03:59
This is how reddit is pretty much setup. Push the propaganda.
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:05:30
I didn’t say cheesy product placement. If the only thing you have to offer is negativity then go elsewhere, I only like people who have ideas.

Not just one murder, but several. A multi-sig deal that requires 7/10 is disrupted when two of the ten required are found dead in their hotel. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 14:12:57
Why would you want a system that is extremely difficult to manipulate? I don’t know.
@_date: 2018-10-14 00:19:16
Right! It wouldn't be difficult to setup a reddit style blockchain based voting system.

I think Bitcoin is perfect for it actually.
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:11:55
Litecoin? doubt it.
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:59:32
Nope, Segwit is garbage. Segwit is nothing more than an attempted co-op of the Bitcoin, it's a joke.
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:32:47
Get creative. I am simply thinking of ways to put Bitcoin more in the mainstream if you will. You know, since their is always something negative about Bitcoin why not try to make something positive as well, and who doesn’t like a good movie? 
The rules say the subject of posts in this subreddit have to be about Bitcoin, so that is what I am trying to do, have conversations about Bitcoin in different ways.
Edit: Also, most great things have multiple contributors. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:31:03
Like BItfinex?
@_date: 2016-11-03 21:56:47
Then I guess they won't hear the idea. I'll just learn to do it myself. Profit.
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:20:31
Hadn't thought of that, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:27:43
In order for the value of Bitcoin to increase people have to start using as a form of exchange and not just hold on to it.

Seventh grade? Is that the best you got? I actually paid attention in seventh grade when they told us the Electoral College actually decides the president. Did you not pay attention when they told you that the government was a scam? They got your brain on lock down.

Didn't know this, thanks. I was really just curious if SegWit was something "permanent" or not.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:20:17
Just because it isn't happening now doesn't mean that it isn't being attempted. It just seems as if this discussion isn't being had and instead is being sold as running a "full node."
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:48:21
You should find a charitable cause to give too, probably one that would promote the adoption of cryptocurrency. ;)
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:27:54
It has been over 12 hours, but not quite 24. Guess I will just wait and hold off on any further transactions.
