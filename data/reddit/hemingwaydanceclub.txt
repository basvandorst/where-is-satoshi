Bitfloor? only tried them once and it went flawlessly but that was a while ago so I'm not sure where they stand in the ranking today.

How much have you guys made since you started? Just curious. I always find it interesting to hear about people Failures/Successes with mining.

I placed an tiny order to see if I could Cancel and there was no Cancel option for me on the history or transaction page and this was no more than 30 seconds after placing the order. So I can confirm that when people they have no option to Cancel right after they purchase coins they aren't lying.

He's trying to scam you bro.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:48:56
That's how the majority of us translated it and that's why a majority of people are upset. Of course coinbases horrible customer service response times do not help inspire faith in their service. Good luck man. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:01:14
Can't argue with this post, I agree with pretty much everything you said. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:42:09
They haven't returned my email yet (in all fairness I sent it an hour or two ago so I don't expect them to get back to me right away) but I'll post here as soon as I hear back. Hopefully this get's resolved or at the very least we get a coinbase rep in this thread. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:01:34
Damn, I still haven't heard from them either. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:12:30
Yeah, once your bank account is verified you can buy bitcoins. Honestly though I'd suggest using a service that doesn't make you wait so long long seeing as the price of BTC is fluctuating and people are taking Initial losses with their Coinbase purchases due to wait times and poorly worded warnings. If you're buying BTC to just hold onto and hope for a price increase then coinbase is fine, if you're looking to get a certain amount of bitcoins to USD so you can buy things with the bitcoins then avoid coinbase like the plague because by the time you get the bitcoin, you won't be able to afford what you planned to buy if bitcoins deflate during your waiting period. 
I think this sums up coinbase pretty fairly.

Same happened to me. I sent them an email about it. Happened to a few friends of mine who are a lot more upset then I am. Personally I dropped a good chunk of money for 1 btc and ended up only getting 1 even though they told me I'd get the Market Value of the day I received them. At least I didn't lose money I needed but still, I know at least 4 other people in the same boat. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:04:59
They also don't increase the amount if bitcoins drop in worth on the day you get yours even though they lower your btc if they increase in worth. If you order 1 bitcoin at 250 dollars and check that box and the market rate of BTC drops to 100 a piece you still only get one bitcoin. But if you spend 250 dollars on one bitcoin and the market price goes to 300 a btc then you get less than 1 btc. It's extremely sketchy. I Wouldn't suggest using coinbase for bitcoins anytime soon, do what the others in this thread suggested.

Quick question, how long is it going to take to get a response on some of our support emails. I've been waiting over 24 hours to get this settled out and am just curious how much longer the wait is? I submitted my email over 24 hours ago but I'm sure their are others ahead of me. Anyhow, thanks for at least filling us in so we're not out in the dark. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:37:20
Yeah, that's why I'm not Cancelling my account. Shit happens and I'm sure they are flooded with Complaints about it all. It would be better if this had never happened but the isn't a perfect world. Coinbase could probably benefit from some sort of system for their support to help them ween out issues. Just hard not to get frustrated when something involving your money get's screwed up and it's been over 2 days since trying to contact their support. Patience is a virtue I guess I should work on. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:04:34
Ok let me try to explain my problem to you. What happened was I placed an order for 1 BTC at 250 (had the cash to throw away so really didn't bother me) and checked the box saying I would receive the future value of BTC. Now they don't clarify if the future amount of BTC will be affected if prices go down, but it will if prices go up. So people like me assumed that if BTC went down- the future rate would give us exactly 250 worth of Bitcoin just like if the price goes up we'd get less bitcoin since that's exactly how they worded it.. Well when the day came for me to get my BTC the price had dropped to 100 dollars a coin and I only got one btc and I assumed I'd get 2.5 seeing as that was the current exchange rate at the time my transaction went through and that's what I agreed to, but that feature only works in their favor if the coin prices go up, not down so I took a 150 dollar loss. Apparently they admitted to it being a coding fuck up as seen [here]( in the posters edit once coinbase finally emailed him back. So yes, coinbase is too blame and they even admit it. What's troubling is that a website that has people's bank accounts linked to it can make such a careless mistake in it's own coding. Really scary ifyou think about what other mistakes could still be sitting in their code that they aren't aware of. I think you're having a hard time understanding this thread and the current issue people are facing. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:03:19
Wait? They are still marking orders as highrisk to people who have a solid purchase history with them? Jeeeee this has been going on for months now, I thought they had that shit ironed out. Yeah, I'm going to use bitfloor from now on. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:00:23
I still haven't been replied to either, this is pretty ridiculous at this point. I've been trying to be understanding seeing as they have a large customer base but at this point if you can't handle the customer who have trusted you with large transaction you sure as fuck shouldn't be taking on new customers and allowing others to join. I really want to give them the Benefit of the doubt but when you make mistakes like this with peoples money you really should reevaluate if you're really the best person to be running a business. Here's to hoping at least one of us get's a response. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:43:24
It's pretty accurate. You don't break even like they make you think. There is actually a whole thread about it [here](
Happened to me today, bought a coin at 250 (4 days ago) with the box checked to receive market value of bitcoin the day my bitcoin comes, and today when I finally got my coin I only got one bitcoin valued at 85 dollars (this afternoon). I thought the same thing which is why I ordered at 250, I assumed I'd get more than 1 since the current value at the time of delivery was 85 dollars a coin. Lost a good chunk of money but at least learned my lesson. Could've been a mistake on their part but it doesn't seem that way, they haven't replied to my email yet. Here and on other forums people are saying they thought the same when they ordered and only received one bitcoin at a huge loss. Just giving you a heads up man, be careful when you order from Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:49:51
Well this is actually pretty good to hear. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:14:50
Bro, your situation is exactly the same as mine. I can't even afford the item I got the bitcoins for. Here's to hoping we aren't the "Yo ass just got fucked" clubs newest members. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:34:46
Obama, is that you???
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:45:52
Trust me bro, you are one of the many people who are upset about this and had this happen to them. Take comfort knowing that you are not alone. I lost about 120 dollars because their future exchange rate policy only seems to work in their favor and only if bitcoins go up in value but if they go down then you don't get the benefit of the future exchange rate policy. It's ungodly confusing and I think I'm done using coinbase, I'd rather just go to the casino and gamble my money while having a good time then risk losing money on Coinbase's backwards policy. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:14:08
This happened to me a while back. Same exact situation. Email them, they aren't denying that they made a mistake on it. It took 3 days to get a reply but the gave me the coins they owed me and explain what happened. They realize what's happening and they are taking care of it man, seriously email their support. It may take a few days but you'll get your moneys worth. What get's me is the people in these threads who act like you're retarded when coinbase is even admitting the check box aspect of their site is a bit glitched out right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:46:59
Yeah, it was all just a mistake on their part and they made good by it. Took a little longer then I would like but they made good and gave me the BTC they owed me. I guess it was a mistake in their coding. Anyways, just posting in here to say Coinbase fixed their mistake for me. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:16:32
Just wanted to post that Coinbase made good by me, thought it took a while they gave me the coin they promised. So I can say that coinbase is not trying to scam anyone, they just made a mistake. Anyways, thanks coinbase!
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:02:30
Sure seems that way, or it's a very loyal coinbase user with a chip on his shoulder. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:05:36
A very horrible mix of fucking people over and incompetence it seems. It's a shame because my first order with them was flawless but my most recent orders have ended up with me taking a loss. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:20:02
Same, I contacted them almost 24 hours ago with no response. it's a bit troubling, I don't think I'm going to use coinbase anymore. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:07:18
It's exactly like that. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:38:39
Essentially, buying from Coinbase is gambling as opposed to other services. I agree they do need to explain their policy quite a bit better, a majority of people, including myself, mistranslated it.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:05:32
Damn, came out better than I did. Been waiting for almost over 32 hours just to talk to their damn customer service about a mistake they made. You could teach a monkey Sign Language and it would have better communication than coinbase. Damn.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:10:56
Unless coins go down in price then he'll just receive one bitcoin and take a loss until the coin value rises, very shady practice on coin bases part but if you plan to hold said coin long term you could still come out on top.
