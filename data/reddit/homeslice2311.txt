I'm in the same boat. I got really excited about the tech when my friend told me about it in 2011 so I bought around 3600 if I remember correctly. I sold within the same week because I lost a lot of money and didn't really grasp the tech at the time. I never checked back on Bitcoin until I heard about it on the news. Hindsight is 20/20 but man that one hurts.

If anyone is wondering this is from his appearance at the London Olmpics 2012 opening ceremonies. He was playing the piano part of the song Chariots of fire.

Wow. I never would have thought that Bitcoin was Bitcoin! Can't believe it took me this long to put two and two together...

Is he died?

Pulled out about $500. The total time I spent at the machine was about 30 seconds. But after I sent the Bitcoin to the QR code I got the cash almost immediately.

Just the standard Bitcoin transaction fee

I think what we can learn from this is no one knows anything and we're all going to die so it doesn't matter.

I wish lol!

No I'm holding $520 exactly. I do not own the machine, I own a lot of Bitcoin and thought it was cool that I could Instantly withdraw cash.

You do that have to wait for any confirmations it dispenses cash immediately after you send the Bitcoin.

How would I exploit it? Asking for a friend.

Big time lambo
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:19:38
Just needed some quick cash. Don't worry I've got plenty Bitcoin and will definitely be buying more soon. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:28:51
Then buy back when it doubles in price the next day. Sell again when it loses 90%. Repeat until lambo.
