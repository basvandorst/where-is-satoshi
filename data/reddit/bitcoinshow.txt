Does the bitcoin jerky taste like 1's &amp;0's?

Where to start?   Do I skip over the "why would I spend if I know bitcoin will be worth more soon" comment?  I just can't do it.  This is an extremely dangerous way to think.  It's impossible to know bitcoin will be worth more soon.  Some might even argue they know bitcoin (or the exchanges) will be illegal soon.  I am not suggesting this to be the case, or even on the table.  Just making a point.  
I guess what I am getting at is "knowing" something is going to be worth more may lead to real financial hardships.  
As to automatically replenishing your bitcoin reserves.  What happens if the exchange can't meet demand?   How will those coins be delivered?  At what price?  I'm not suggesting it's a bad idea, I actually like it.  There just might be some obstacles that might stand in the way.

If you didn't lock in some of those gains, you have noone to blame but yourself.  With that said suicide is never a good idea.  Besides what if you killed yourself and bitcoin goes back to a $1000 tommorrow?

Nothing like a free and open Internet 😥. Maybe one day we can create an Internet passport so it can be determined if you have buisness at the approved site you're attempting to visit

This is nothing new with PayPal. I may be crazy and ignorant, but why not accept bitcoin for your bitcoin related buisness?

Are not all posts based on emotion?   One might even go on to suggest that all communication is based on emotion.  Your request is not only unreasonable, but impossible.
