I'd be more gutted in loosing the opportunity to have whatever the worth of 1btc is in ratio (up to 1mill even!) to my holdings than to loose a couple of thousand if the whole thing burned to zero.

When you hold bitcoin, you hold  it. It cannot be loaned out like banks do in fractional reserve banking. It cannot be duplicated, nor do you need much security to protect it physically like you would with gold. It's easily transferable. And most importantly, it cannot be frozen from you, as an asset you control it's movement and it is borderless. If you hodl 1btc in europe, you hold 1btc in russia and 1 btc in usa etc. Transactions are recorded and cast in steel so to speak so if there is ever any dispute of payment you have a "receipt".

You don't, you buy/own units of bitcoin. a single Bitcoin 1.0BTC is divisible many times over (forgot the actual amount, its like 0.0000000001 or something).
You can buy/invest by signing up to an exchange, like coinbase/gdax/bitfinex/bittrex/binance etc.

if you are the "maker" on a transaction in an exchange you pay no fees

Never used it but people have said this is good. Still uses a middle man though.

I know this is great and everything, but BTC has been at ~$4620 before albeit indirectly. Through Euro on GDAX on the 17th August, it was at around 3850euro which is around 4620, interestingly it was only around 4450 ish around that time for the USD.

It's on back order but mine came 2 weeks early when the backorder was 1 month. 12 days at the very most isn't a long wait
