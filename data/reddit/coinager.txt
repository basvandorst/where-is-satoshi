First, I have tough skin, not driving me away, second I don't see how it easier to manipulate. I'm not a pro but I believe in the Solidcoin developers, they have a well thought out plan. I guess I am a little sensitive to BCX as him and the Bitcoin community have relentlessly attacked and have yet to succeed.

This looks like the work of BitcoinEXpress to me, especially since he was talking about doing this very thing in BTC-E chat and IRQ just two days ago. 
This is how he makes money these days. Massive sell off and buy back slowly at much lower prices. He did the same thing to NMC a while back except he crashed the market with hacking rumors and them bought low. Undoubtedly it will come back up and he will make a nice sum of money.
 People like Gox, TH, Bitcointalk, BTC-E and CryptoXchange are to blame for treating this ass clown like a Rockstar. I'm just glad Solidcoin is immune to this BS.

I don't claim to be an expert programmer and no I am not a troll. I responded to a Facebook post by CryptoXchange who has since removed it as I called them out on pandering to the criminal BitcoinEXpress. Yes my first time here.
Not silly, BCX is a well known top holder of Bitcoin and enjoys carte blanc treatment everywhere in the BTC world. It is also firmly established that BCX manipulates several of the markets with sell off floods and buy backs. He crashes the markets with any means possible including hacking and 51% attacks. Examples NMC, FairBrix abd GG. BCX was the entire reason for the SC1 overhaul.
A lot of people seriously think he was behind the Allinvain and even the MTGox debacle. BCX paid off CryptoXchange to not support Solidcoin and that is a known fact by the SC dev RealSolid.
Solidcoin plugs the holes that Bitcoin has.
I just don't get why people treat him like a rockstar, it's sicking to see the fawning when he graces BTC-E.
