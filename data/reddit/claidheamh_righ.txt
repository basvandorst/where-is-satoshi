Well that one's obvious to everyone who understands that bitcoin isn't a currency and has no hope of ever actually in competing with fiat currencies or somehow existing without them.
Bitcoin is a commodity, not a currency. If it was a currency, these price increases (which are being compared to USD not a CoL index which should be your first clue) *would be terrible.* Nobody can use a currency that acts like this.

A future potential they are assuming to be true; i.e., they think they can predict the future. Bitcoin is a speculative commodity. It's not a currency, it's not the future of world finance, it's a risky commodity investment, and not just because it's a single investment. It has numerous issues a safe investment would not. Investing hugely in bitcoin is longterm gambling.

We're not talking about the market as a whole. We're talking about the overvalued companies. Some went under, some recovered but even today aren't anywhere near their value. What you're actually saying here is that you can predict the future.

I never said anything of the sort. What I said is that bitcoin is a risky commodity investment, which it is. Risky doesn't mean it will fail, risky means there's no reliable way to predict it's future.

Which means it's literally useless except as a speculative investment, except this speculative investment got where it is now because people thought it could be a currency. So it's a bubble unless everyone collectively agrees to keep playing the lottery together.
