Yes, it's from GDAX. In order to provide our customers with wire transfers and a withdrawal-based limit structure, some users need to update their GDAX profile. We've emailed these customers with a reminder that this update needs to be completed by Tuesday August 9th. If not complete, their GDAX account will be suspended from trading ( however they can still withdraw fiat and crypto funds of course). This update only affects GDAX customers (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange). Coinbase customers will not be affected.

DailySteals is now offering discounted products that can only be purchased with bitcoin. Add “exclusivity” to the list of reasons why it’s great to use bitcoin and pick up a Jawbone Mini Jambox for 61% off the retail price.
DailySteals is also keeping half of its proceeds in bitcoin and will post a full analysis of the initiative on their blog in a few weeks. So start your holiday shopping and help make DailySteal’s experiment a success!

Yes, absolutely. Our goal is to create the most liquid, stable, and transparent bitcoin exchange in the world. We are more than happy to work with others in the Bitcoin space and give them the ability to trade on Coinbase Exchange just like any other business or individual.

Hi sentdex. We don't have that feature but will be posting new states to our blog. As long as you are subscribed to the blog, you'll know when new states (including Texas) are added.

Yes, we will support subscription and auth/hold transactions so Braintree's entire suite of merchants can add bitcoin. Those customers will have to pay from a Coinbase wallet since it will be "pull" based.

tl;dr - Coinbase maintains strict controls over which internal employees can view exchange open orders. 
In order to troubleshoot issues or answer account inquiries, senior customer support administrators can view exchange account details. These administrators may only view exchange open orders in the context of aiding with an account inquiry, and these account views are always logged.
Coinbase employees involved in trading or financial operations on behalf of the company do not have access to user exchange open orders. We take our user's trading privacy seriously and have strict controls on administrator access to user's exchange account details.

GDAX supplies the funding for all margin trades, there is no p2p lending book. 
There are no special fees or interest rates to access margin trading.

Yep, good catch. I misspoke but didn't get a chance to correct myself during the segment - meant to say $100k/minute.

We are! Check out our careers page and DM me if you apply

It's on our product roadmap but probably a few quarters out. The Coinbase app may work if you're not looking to do a lot of trading.

Ryndon - PM me and I'll see if I can help you out.

We plan to keep it in place indefinitely (as long as fraudsters don't find a way to abuse it).

Sorry about the gif size, we're replacing it with one that has a higher resolution. 
To answer your question - incoming bank wires (to Coinbase) incur a $10 fee; outgoing bank wires (from Coinbase) incur a $12 fee.

Thanks! Just shot your husband an email!
@_date: 2013-10-11 05:37:00
Of course! Send me a PM and I'll do whatever I can to help.

Yes, you can buy up to 1 bitcoin immediately if you verify a credit card and your identity. Otherwise, it will take ~ one week to verify you bank account before you can purchase bitcoins.

Message received, loud and clear! 
The multicurrency bank idea is interesting but still a long ways off. I'll make sure you pin code app feedback, however, is relayed directly to our devs.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:08:58
We did! Always happy to receive feedback and make improvements where we can.
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:17:00
Agreed! We're working hard to make that happen.
@_date: 2013-10-11 05:24:53
Reached out to them - will let you know how it goes!

Hey Chris, I'm just starting a two week trial with the team at Coinbase so, sadly, no mug shot on the website yet. You can email me at adam_at_coinbase_dot_com with any suggestions or questions, though!
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:00:37
Boom. I'll name my first born "Melting_Harps" to commemorate this occasion.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:56:26
Thanks! Yeah, I wish everyone was honest and we could, on good faith, allow instant buys without a credit card. Sadly, people aren't and we need that as a back up form of payment to prevent fraud. Can't promise anything will come of it but I'll look into other methods in lieu of a credit card.
@_date: 2013-10-11 05:00:58
Just reached out to Ript Appareal. Will let you know what I hear!
@_date: 2013-10-11 07:15:20
Thanks for the kind words - glad you love it!

Hey RH, PM me and let's connect over the phone tomorrow.
