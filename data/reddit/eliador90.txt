Thanks for your comment and positive words.
It was indeed a lot of work to research and create this report. This research is intended to be free, but as you can imagine i would like to monetize my services in the future for a fee. 
In addition to valuations like this, I am also offering normal market screenings (long/short list) and more qualitative research reports. 
Nevertheless, I'll still publish some other research for free again in the upcoming months. 
I also see the point in your criticism. We are still very early in the space of cryptoasset valuations, there are various competing views, and no clear consensus has been reached yet regarding which valuation approaches make the most sense. 
This approach definitely has some shortcomings, but I believe it at least gives a price indication / range that is "justified" if the token actually gains &amp; enables a certain market size. It also allows investors to sensibility check if a price of X actually makes sense. 
In my example it is shown for instance, that an extreme price of 20k would be way above anything that is justified by the actual utility value of BTC.

Hi reddit, I am the founder of a young startup (BlockNovum) that is specialized on Blockchain and Cryptoasset investment research. We aim to value cryptoassets according to fundamental drivers and their long-term potential. Since cryptos are not companies (they have no cash flows), traditional investment valuation methods such as DCF can’t be used.
 
Various crypto valuation approaches have been pioneered over the last months by exponents such as Chris Burniske, Alex Evans, Dmitry Kalichkin, u/arsonbunny and others. I studied these different valuation methods to refine and professionalize them. My goal is to advance the practices how we value this new asset class. 
Since we just **released our first public investment research report that covers  Bitcoin [BTC]**, I thought it would be great to share the report here on reddit and get feedback from the community:
*  You can see the executive summary / one pager of our valuation in the above picture. 
* Find the complete [Bitcoin investment research report here]( or download it on [BlockNovum’s website](
Below I provide a brief written summary of the findings and valuation results: 
**Executive Summary / tl;dr:**
In the report **BlockNovum issues a Buy rating for BTC**, as long as the market price stays below their **current target price of $8,000**. The price target represents the present value of BTC’s expected current and future utility values obtained through a **fundamental valuation**. BTC also shows substantial long-term price appreciation potential if use cases mature and gain more market share. Based on the valuation, a BTC price of above $10,000 is a realistic possibility in the next 12 months.
**Research Approach:** 
The report consists of an extensive fundamental valuation of Bitcoin, based on the **expected utility values of its most promising use cases**. BlockNovum’s financial model then calculates the present value of a Bitcoin token, by discounting these future utility value inherent to one BTC at a discount rate of 30%. Consequently, the identified **present value** then helps decide if Bitcoin is **under- or overvalued at today’s price level**.
In addition, alternative valuation approaches are illustrated, such as cost-based valuation or ratio-analysis, to achieve a holistic valuation perspective and to verify the $8,000 valuation result. Finally, BlockNovum analyzes Bitcoin according to a set of key qualitative assessment factors. The complete analysis is then synthesized into a recommendation and investment profile.
**Summary of Bitcoin Investment Report:** 
BlockNovum expects the price of Bitcoin to have a **current value of $8,000 per BTC**. This price is justified by the present values of the underlying future utility values of modeled Bitcoin use cases. The store of value (“digital gold”) use case, along with the usage as a gateway to other cryptoassets, promises a substantial addressable market size for Bitcoin. The size of the market served by BTC, for these two use cases alone, is estimated to **be over $2.8 trillion in 2028**. Further markets where Bitcoin acts as a transfer facilitator (though at a smaller scale) are digital payments, remittances, and banking of the unbanked.
Bitcoin’s characteristics as a fully digital, safe, decentralized, scarce and autonomous currency free from any government control makes it a perfect fit as a digital store of value asset with appreciation potential. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s ability to reduce transaction costs and simultaneously increase speed through technological improvements (e.g. Lightning Network) makes its usage highly attractive in the other aforementioned industries.
BlockNovum also estimates that 66% of today’s present value of $8,000 is based on current utility value and 34% accounts for speculation on future utility value.
An alternative approach, **cost-based valuation, predicts a price range of $7,440 and $8,670 per BTC**, validating the fundamental valuation result. The ratio analysis — consisting of Network Value to Transactions Ratio (NVT), Price to Metcalfe Ratio (P/M), and Network Value to Metcalfe Ratio (NVM) indicates that BTC is currently largely supported by fundamentals. However, **short-term corrections are a possibility** if fundamentals don’t develop as expected or market sentiment stays bearish. For example, NVM shows signs of a temporary overvaluation of BTC, which might lead cautious investors to delay investing for a few months.
Nevertheless, the qualitative assessment confirms BTC’s strong positioning in six assessment categories, which supports its **leading role as a “blue chip” token in the cryptoasset space**. Recent developments such as the announcement of Bakkt, a jointly launched company by Starbucks, NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange, and Microsoft to create an open and regulated, global ecosystem for digital assets, highlight Bitcoin’s perceived potential among leading corporations.
**Conclusion:** 
**BlockNovum issues a Buy rating for Bitcoin**, as long as the BTC price stays below the **target price of $8,000**. Hence, investors should aim to buy Bitcoin below the target price and account for their preferred margin of safety. Bitcoin serves several promising use cases, which gives it fundamental value. In particular, the store of value use case, where **Bitcoin serves as digital gold**, offers **enormous market potential** with an estimated market size of $2.6 trillion served by BTC in 2028. The qualitative assessment framework and ratio analysis confirmed Bitcoin’s strong and continuously growing fundamentals and further support BlockNovum’s price target. However, another short-term price correction is a possibility if fundamental on-chain activity does not develop as expected.
**Future Research:**
Bitcoin is one of many promising cryptoassets that BlockNovum is covering in the upcoming months.

Hi reddit,
If you are interested in new &amp; upcoming blockchain projects this might be for you: 
My startup BlockNovum just published its second public Blockchain research report, which provides a **comprehensive market overview about Blockchain startups in Switzerland**. The report specifically focuses on “Newcomers” in the Blockchain space. This selection includes startups that did conduct an ICO in 2018 (or are planning to ICO later this year), that were newly founded in 2018, or that managed to get first measurable traction (through product release or media attention) in 2018.
The aim of the report is to provide a thorough overview about Swiss newcomers in the blockchain space for investors and industry exponents alike. The map helps navigate the ever-growing crypto landscape in Switzerland by listing all relevant new startups in one place and classifying them in different categories.
**[Download the full report here]( 
**Research Focus:**
BlockNovum categorized the screened projects in five categories: Technical, Organizational, Financial, Retail &amp; Entertainment, and Personal.
* **Technical:** Projects that provide a technical solution or service related to the blockchain technology. This includes new protocols, blockchain layers, file storage, computation, cyber security, artificial intelligence (AI), technical platforms, and infrastructure solutions related to the blockchain.
* **Financial:** Projects and services with a focus on financial applications and use cases. This category includes new cryptocurrencies, exchanges, payment systems, banking services, prediction markets, funds &amp; investment services, investment related data &amp; information platforms, tokenized assets, and others.
* **Organizational:** Projects with an organizational focus that mainly tackle challenges related to coordinating, tracking, and organizing people, resources, or data. Hence, this category consists of use cases around governance, supply chain, internet of things (IoT), content distribution, energy etc.
* **Personal:** This category includes startups that provide applications for personal use in daily life. Therefore, this section lists offerings around personal authentication, social networks, messaging, personal data &amp; monetization, advertising, or personal healthcare.
* **Retail &amp; Entertainment:** The last category includes services with a retail focus or with entertainment purposes. Blockchain startups in this category offer services around marketplaces, gaming, virtual reality, music, sports, art, education, ticketing, and others.
Furthermore, the research focus was explicitly set on projects that were founded and are operational in Switzerland. Companies that have their headquarters in Switzerland and/or conduct an ICO according to Swiss regulations were also included.
Overall BlockNovum identified **78 blockchain-related projects that matched the selection criteria.** Note that “older” and more established cryptoassets / startups that did an ICO in 2017, or earlier, were not included in the map. Therefore, you won’t find the likes of Ethereum, Ambrosus, Modum, Lykke, Cardano, Shapeshift etc. in this overview.
**Findings &amp; Selection of 15 High Potential Startups:**
In the report BlockNovum lists all 78 startups including a categorization and short description for each. Out of all screened startups, BlockNovum selected **15 projects which were assessed to have the highest investment potential**. The selection was based on the expected product-market fit, viability of use cases, founding team and experience, stage of development, quality of website/whitepaper/MVP, and the token type &amp; usage.
It has to be noted that several startups in the map came out of stealth mode very recently or are at a very early stage of development. Therefore, these projects could not be properly assessed yet and stay on our watchlist. Consequently this list is not to be seen as final and will be updated for interested clients in the future.
To illustrate BlockNovum’s market research and investment screening offering, an example assessment of long-listed and short-listed startups is given as well in the report. The long-list analysis covers the selected “Technical” and “Financial” startups, whereas the “short-list” assessment example is performed for “Proxeus“. This type of research is primarily geared towards investors who require a high-level market overview and assessment of several startups that match their investment criteria. Subsequently, short-listed projects can then be properly analyzed and evaluated with BlockNovum’s in-depth investment research &amp; due diligence offering.
I hope this overview is helpful or of interest to some of you. 
Feedback always welcome. Thanks.

Technical analysis like the one in the link is more short-term and the value is in my opinion questionable since market sentiment can change very quickly. 
I propose a more long-term fundamental view on Bitcoin price. For example, I just posted a [fundamental view on Bitcoin price in another post.](

Thanks for your constructive comment! 
This use case entails the usage of Bitcoin to buy/sell other cryptoassets. Most cryptos can only be purchased by spending BTC or Ether since they don't have a fiat trading pair (apart from a few of the most established cryptos). Therefore, this use case takes into account the demand for BTC that is used to buy/sell other cryptos on crypto exchanges. 
Since complete data for the exact split of Ether and Bitcoin is not available, I assumed a 50% split (i.e. 50% of Crypto investments [excl. BTC and ETH] are made with BTC and 50% with ETH). 
However, I modeled a decreasing market share of BTC in the model, since I assume that more and more cryptoassets will be available to buy via fiat or other cryptos. 
I hope this helps :)

According to your argument, then all the countless research and valuations of equities performed by sell &amp; buy-side analysts, investment funds, analysts on pages like seeking alpha etc. would be also worthless. I disagree. 
I see definitely demand for professional research and price valuations of cryptos among investors (analog to existing research for equities). Especially institutional investors would never invest in an asset without doing their due diligence and performing a price valuation.

Apologies for the confusion.. The following passage is a typical legal disclaimer used by many established investment and advisory firms. 


My reports are primarily targeted at institutional investors, for which I provide advice / research. However, these reports would not be public. 
I added the disclaimer retroactively, since I am publishing this report here publicly. Therefore, the language is not really consistent between the original intended usage of the report and the disclaimer. 
I'll make the wording clearer next time. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:44:47
Full agree with you &gt; You realize that the volatility we are experiencing is unavoidable when you combine the psychology of the market with the break neck pace Bitcoin is going on it’s road to becoming the world reserve currency. 
I make a similar argument that Bitcoin's main use case is as a **digital store of value (gold)**. In this context, I recently had a detailed look at these potential use cases markets and modeled Bitcoin's addressable market to get a "present value" for Bitcoin. 
I believe that with such a fundamental approach and a long-term time horizon, many investors would feel a lot more confident in Bitcoin's price and not care about short-term market sentiment. 
Have a look at my post for a more [detailed analysis of BTC price]( if you are interested. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:29:58
Agreed with your first two statements. However, if you'd had read the report you see that I address this point specifically. **Traditional valuation methods like DCF cannot be employed for cryptos.** That's exactly why many researchers are looking at **new models** on how to value cryptoassets (often based on models that take into consideration demand and supply characteristics). My research is one such example. 
Have a look at my report or the writing of Chris Burniske or Alex Evans (two very respected thought leaders in the crypto space) to find more information. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:18:53
Like you, I'm also a big fan of Warren Buffet. 
Nevertheless, from what I read about him and know about value investing, value investors employ probably similar principles as I did in my report. 
Among them: 
* Bottom-up valuation: I value BTC "bottom-up", based on potential market share &amp; size)
* Formulate conservative valuation assumptions: If you look at the model, I focused on the most realistic use cases and applied conservative &amp; realistic estimates regarding growth rates (s-curve assumption). 
* Long time horizon: I state that the valuation is based on a long-term assessment. Short-term price movements and market sentiment might result in completely different pricings than predicted by the model. However, I am of the opinion that a fundamental long-term valuation can give some indication of the underlying utility and value of a token. 
* Value is always subjective, that's where risks and opportunities arise: Also in response to the comment above, everyone has a different opinion about Bitcoin's value and figures out what its worth to him/her. Nevertheless, I advocate to do a proper due diligence before making any investment decisions (and don't listen to the "experts" how tell you that BTC is going to 100k or 0 without any reasoning) 
In the end, investors need to be confident in their assessment about the asset's value. Only divergent price views lead to a functioning market. 
- Invest with a margin of safety: I calculate a present value of BTC's future utility values, however I also advise in the research to employ an appropriate margin of safety (individual to each investor). 
You don't have to agree with my research approach.
All I am trying to do, is applying some of the crypto valuation principles that established itself over the last years to get a reasonable price expectation for Bitcoin. I would suggest that having a proper price assessment is preferable to just listening to market sentiment or "expert" opinions. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:23:36
I would say many of the researchers who developed the methodologies on cryptoasset valuations, would consider themself value investors too. Also please see the comment in my other post.

Hi reddit, I'm proud to announce that my startup BlockNovum published its second public investment research report covering Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the world’s biggest cryptoasset exchange. 
The report consists of two parts:
**1. Valuation of the BNB token price** based on a long-term fundamental view of its utility value.
**2. Qualitative assessment of Binance**, the company behind BNB, based on BlockNovum’s due diligence methodology for early-stage blockchain startups. 
Find our key results in the **executive summary below, or read the full report** to get an in-depth look at Binance / BNB.
Future cryptoasset investment research reports with valuations of handpicked cryptoassets are offered via a **subscription model or on-demand**. For further details please get in touch with us at info
# **[Download the full BNB Investment Research Report (20 pages) here](
# Executive Summary 
 Valuation
BlockNovum establishes a **price target of $17.7 per Binance Coin (BNB) for long-term investors.** We see this price justified by the present value of the underlying future utility values of three modeled BNB use cases until 2023:
1. Payment of **trading fees** on Binance exchange with BNB (incentivized through discount).
2. **Repurchase of BNB** through Binance profits.
3. **“Others”** including BNB demand for investment purposes, gas for decentralized exchange, voting power, referral bonus etc.
We expect 88% of today’s BNB present value to be based on current utility and 12% on speculation of future utility value.
[Valuation Image](
 Qualitative Assessment
BlockNovum believes that Binance was able to grow a massive user base and become the biggest crypto exchange due to its ability to move incredibly fast. They managed to assemble a team, get ICO funding, and launch a trading platform in a matter of weeks. The right market timing combined with their ability to onboard users very quickly, their wide ranging offering of popular cryptoassets, and their capabilities to handle large number of users was definitely one of the key points for Binance's early success. The BNB coin with its utility for discounted fees and with its profit buyback mechanism was innovative for its time and further supported user growth.
 While moving fast, Binance might have also stepped into some legal greyzones, by avoiding local regulations through rapid relocation to other (more crypto-friendly) jurisdictions. In general, we also have some concerns around Binance’s governance structure and company data availability. Furthermore, it can’t be ignored that Binance listed several low-quality tokens on their exchange, which might leave a tainted reputational mark.
Nevertheless, we see Binance as well-positioned as the leading cryptoasset exchange for a future where cryptoassets become more and more accepted in the broader public. Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”) and his team realized that by **building a whole ecosystem around Binance and its native BNB token, Binance can positively influence its own market position and set itself up for long-term success.** With their various initiatives, such as Binance Labs, Binance Blockchain, ICO launchpad, Academy, Crypto bank etc., Binance is offering services along the whole value chain and is distinguishing itself against their competition. As a result, they managed to become one of the leading exchanges and with CZ they have a popular crypto persona as their CEO.
 Investment Thesis
The various initiatives with the BNB token at their center make us feel optimistic about BNB’s ability to **capture long-term value**. This view is confirmed by our long-term fundamental-based valuation that yielded a **present utility value of one BNB token at $17.7.** Therefore, BlockNovum issues a Buy rating for BNB since the current price lies significantly below BNB’s calculated current utility value and discounted PV. BNB seems to be undervalued considering the size of the “economy” that the Binance ecosystem facilitates.
