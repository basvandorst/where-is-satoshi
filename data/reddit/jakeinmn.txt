The thing is theres no other niche like this for bitcoins. I get what your saying, but theres nothing like this for bitcoinage so far.

I invested in a ton of white american apparels since my main designs were in black. I invested about 500 because a 100+ upvote thread I made suggested they would at least give me a return on the investment. Nope.
I do have colors, just randomly selected left overs from othe tshirt orders, but they may or may not be in your size. Its on a page somewhere.

I have no smart phone nor programming experience. The only thing I can contribute is the business and web aspect of it. I posted asking if anyone would want to help contact other programmers to see if they'd want to post their application for coinage.

How would someone purchase ALL of it? If you mean someone went out of their way to buy everysingle bitcoin at exchangers like mtgox, thats still only a fraction. People are holding onto bit coins, and are mining them each day.
Don't forget of the massive price increase when people find out the goverments "BUYING" all of the bitcoins.

I sold a tshirt today off jaketees.com for 1 btc, and the price jumped to 24 when I last checked.
ITs a pretty good way of getting coinage.

I was saying that people would upload their applications to be bought via bitcoin. Its so programmers can get bitcoin.

I can charge you over google checkout for one BTC if you'd like. I just got a ton of BTC and I'll sell you one for twenty if you want to PM me.

How do you make the rigs since you don't use them for anything else?
Do you overclock them and submerge them in coolant?
also are you disapointed that the price dropped dramatically?

The bitcoin faucets in the start were when people earned thousands of bitcoins a day and just gave out five or ten bitcoins since they were essentially worthless and to people that wanted OMG MY OWN BITCOINS.
Now that bitcoin is harder to mine, they let them go out at fewer and lower ammounts to the point where its inefficient to use since the resources are out for those to make their own resources.
I got bitcoins a while ago, well,.2 from a site, but it was absolutly free.
Now its like .001...
