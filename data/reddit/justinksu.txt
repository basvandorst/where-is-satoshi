Bitcoin's new motto.  I don't think Douglas Adams would have minded.

Let me know two days ahead of time.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:22:42
Thanks :)  I'm lucky that my balance was in USD (*maybe*).

What he means by [single family office](

Most don't carry *that* kind of cash, and a credit/debit card instead.

Distributed exchange with a reliable escrow is the dream.  How you know the escrow is reliable is the challenge.
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:58:09
I think the sellers are better protected than the buyers.  It's hard to force you to transfer bitcoins.  It's easy to hold someone up for their physical wallet.

If only Bitcoin were as easy to buy as lottery tickets...

Where did they go?

What is segwit? I know it means segregated witness, but I haven't found a simple explanation of how it would work.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:16:25
I understand the arguments about the block size, but what confuses me, is why do they call it segwit?  The name segregated witness implies there is something outside the network or some other process that validates the transactions before putting them in the block.  If it's just increasing the block size, what's the origin of the segwit name?

Are you willing to donate it to Creative Commons so I can use it when accepting bit coins?

No love for Pt or LTC?
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:12:34
There is an ETF that is backed by physical platinum.    If you have 160ish dollars, you can buy some.

Remember that competition is almost always good in a free market economy.  The alternate hashing and decreased processing time will only push Bitcoin to improve.
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:44:28
Good question
1. I'm established on E-Bay, so I already have a good reputation there.
2. I'm willing to accept USD.
3. I've never heard of Bitmit.
4. I don't see how using Bitmit "supports Bitcoin" any more than accepting payment on another site.  Please enlighten me.

I use it to mine LTC and love it.

I think using P2Pool is a nice distributed alternative.  Or put something similar in the core client.

I don't think the order of the b-tree is correct.

What I would give to do a "straddle" on this price...

What is it?

Solid argument.

Welcome to the unregulated trade market of the unregulated currency.  Not for the faint of heart.
@_date: 2013-03-10 18:42:34
That's actually a pretty nice tutorial.  Figuring it all out myself took some time.  Then of course I encrypted my wallet with what must have been a typo.  Starting over, I'm finally back to where I started.
Is DiabloMiner any better than an OpenCL miner?
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:38:09
I actually went looking for this and had trouble finding the exact terms.  I finally found their "[Accepted Payment Policy](  What is most interesting is remote cash transactions are not allowed, but in person cash transactions are.  I guess I'm just going to have to require "meeting up" with the person to do the Bitcoin transaction :)
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:02:48
It all depends on what you are hedging against.  If you think there will be hyper inflation, this is still a reasonable investment.  If you think there is going to be a great fall of civilization, then a pound of gold is going to do you no good.  Go buy some guns and ammo. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:04:17
Sure.  I'm a fair seller and have a good rep.  I'm not willing to risk that.  Especially not for a small transaction.  In fact I'm taking a risk accepting BTC, because we *could* be in a bubble state.  But I think if BTC is going to be successful, then it has to be actually used as money, not just an hedge mechanism.

Rarity != Value

I think the OP may have done more harm by posting the links.  I wouldn't have watched the videos if he didn't link him.  Or maybe the OP is Duane :P
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:01:22
Agreed.  But right now it's hard to distinguish the legitimate demand for the currency due to it's usefulness and the speculation/manipulation.  
I'm not saying I don't like the concept of BitCoins, I just think it's dangerous to hype it up like this.  The best way to support the currency is to use it, not buy, hold, and hope it will go higher.
@_date: 2013-03-04 05:50:27
I would only agree with that statement if the person is debt free 
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:17:42
Couldn't you say the same about platinum?
@_date: 2013-04-01 01:59:48
To quote you in this very thread:
["It's never about the intrinsic properties of a metal, it's just simple supply and demand."](
Same applies to crytocurrencies.

Are you willing to donate this version to Creative Commons so I can use it when accepting Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:03:04
If OP really cared, he would have at least posted a link in his comments: 
@_date: 2013-03-10 19:03:54
I'm usually not much into conspiracy theories, but I think the advent of ASICs have created a price spike in BitCoins because people realize they will be harder to obtain in the future.  If Butterfly Labs had the foresight they could have invested pre-orders in Bitcoins and made a ton cash.  Self-fulfilling prophecy so-to-speak.
@_date: 2013-03-10 04:04:42
I like the concept, but it's not like the US is going to ban "Bitcoin".  They will ban or more likely place taxes on "non-government backed currencies".  It won't matter what word you put in front of "coin".
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:34:56
And then came P2Pool

Can I get a refund on my pre-order?


@_date: 2013-03-06 04:15:10
Both sides of the trade are so sure they are right, that's why there are so many trades and so much volatility right now.  Each side thinks the they know the unknowns.  
If only there were BTC derivatives where I could take a straddle position on $43.
