Really depends how into it you want to get. If you don't really have the time to research it, it doesn't sound like you want to day trade. I would honestly just buy a few hundreds bucks worth, throw it into a blockchain wallet and once you have the coins do research on the market. Buy more if you think it'll go up, sell em if you think it'll go down

I'm mobile right now and can't cite who posted this but someone said on another post here how nobody uses ETH really for anything right now, bitcoin is actually implemented into things and I believe has the infrastructure to continue growing and being implemented into new payment systems. 
I'm watching ETH thinking to myself, is it too late to invest? But apparently every day this week is a new high for ETH and I'm not comfortable with investing money into it and watching it dip. But Bitcoin has me a bit on edge after this ETF is denied and with these volatile dips with a ton of resistance getting back up. So when I'm on edge and I see people joking around in this sub it pisses me off lol. But like many others I'm hodling

Thank you for the responses. I'm asking because I'm sure like many others I'll be spending the day refreshing my page every 30 seconds on wherever it will be first published
