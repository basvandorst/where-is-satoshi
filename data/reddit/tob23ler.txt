I'm not sure this comment could be any more short sighted.  
You do understand there is a global economy, yes? If you're American, you are aware of the economic situation forthcoming (i hope), yes?
There are literally hundreds of other points that i could make that factor in more than simply "this thing gets bought and sold until the greatest fool has all the useless bags at the end".

"You cannot create fake money" is exactly the argument that many people outside of crypto say to remain outside. 
The irony is palpable. 
Even people who know about btc find whatever reasons they can to stay uninterested. And then, if the price goes up, they get even more oppositional. 
Kinda funny actually

Do you have any crypto yourself? Just curious.
The argument you and others seem to be engaged in is an all-or-nothing binary dichotomy where btc is supposed to triumphantly usurp fiat and the world just flips on a dime. Of course it's easy to call people shortsighted and naive. But it's not realistic. 
The reason it will continue to rise in the foreseeable future (imo) is because it will be an alternative that grows in popularity and awareness while global economies slowly crumble into inflationary chaos

I'm not sure about that. It's a bit like schrodinger's cat, isn't it.
Supply isn't a social-psychological phenomenon. 
Its a mathematical quantity. Therefore, if some btc are no longer accessible (for whatever reason; they are lost) then they cannot be included in the available supply
