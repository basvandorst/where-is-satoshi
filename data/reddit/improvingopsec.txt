Yeah, because someone's really going to bomb it. Well, actually... I wouldn't feel bad if someone did, just saying, but I doubt it's going to happen.

Of course we think this is stupid.

No logging. Right.
Here's what happens. Your local tyrannical branch of the thought police go visit your exchange. They happily give up your IP, which is found to belong to a VPN server. Then said authorities go to said VPN service - at which point if they don't keep logs, they will be forced to. Which is why you never use a VPN for anonymity.

Of course I do. If no one knows who is running it, it's harder to subpoena my user account records (not like I use my real IP anyway, but still.) If they care about their privacy, I find it more likely they will protect mine.

Two issues: One, that exchange may require irritating info, two, VPNs are for privacy - NOT anonymity.

Well, think about it for a moment. Bitcoin was $1200 once - if ever there was a time to cut and run, that was it. Not to say they won't if BTC reaches $2000 or more, but the fact that they didn't disappear with more than 2x the money gives me confidence for the time being.
Additionally, the risk that they will run with it is simply one that is an acceptable tradeoff to me. I never keep money in exchanges, and I never put much in there anyway. Risking less than $1k of my money is worth the increased protection of my anonymity. Once that is lost, the only way to get it back would be to more or less kill yourself, getting a new identity. Would I rather lose around $1k and keep my privacy and anonymity, or would I rather lose my anonymity? To me, that is not a question at all.

Well, that was just the first permanent measure that came into my mind, and also the simplest. I mean, you could cut the power to stop it temporarily, or you could send in a team commando style to destroy the shit, but the easiest and simplest way to take it offline permanently is to turn the whole place into a steaming parking lot, I think.
