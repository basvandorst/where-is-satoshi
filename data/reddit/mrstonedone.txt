Most of the time, they aren't paywall'ed if you visit the link from google.
So the poster doesn't even know if thats how they found it.

Its dogecoin.
Dogecoin brought the idea of digital currency into minds that otherwise wouldn't have cared.
Fuck, you hear about it on nascar now.
I have had only a few of my friends ask me about bitcoin since its inception.
I still get questions about dogecoin.

Oh shut the fuck up already.
The fact apple can make that decision at all is why apple is an issue.

To figure out how to do most of this, you might need to talk to the guy who runs your automod bot.
Basicly: automod can be configured via a special mod only wiki page to automatically delete posts based on triggers, you might know this part already.
Automoderator doesn't (as far as i know, i run my own version of the bot since its open source, and i don't stay up to date on the latest new features) pick up on anything by marking it as spam. only triggers you setup work with it.
Some ideas for stopping the spam:
Don't ban the users spamming, instead, setup auto delete triggers that matches their username, and deletes without any sort of notification. this way they keep spamming without knowing anyone is on to them
Setup delete triggers that matches known addresses they spam. Be careful about doing this so only 100% known bad urls are deleted. Don't have the bot issue a deleted warning message for the same reason as above. If the spammers know you are on to them, they will switch to a new site.
Consider flat out setting up a delete trigger for "lost number coins"
the person who runs automoderator will more likely than not help you design some triggers for this.

they use a cdn/caching service. it won't cache webpages but rather forwards the request to the server, but it will cache content files like images or pdfs, their favicon is still being served as well.

by calculating trends.
If its an outgoing transaction (someone withdrawing bitcoins), it would be unlikely to see that address as often. If its going to a central hot wallet owned in whole or in part by mtgox, we will see that wallet more often.
If we don't see any trends to central wallet(s), than mtgox was obfuscating destinations; Which will speak more to the legitimacy of their statements than finding these central wallets will.

Read the post before replying, that way you look like less of a dumbass

Yes. They had been "processing" cash withdrawals forever now. and by processing, i mean they said it would get processed, but never did anything unless it was a small amount. This has been the case for amoust a year now I think.
On feb 7 they disabled bitcoin withdrawals, meaning nobody could get cash or bitcoins out, but everybody could still deposit both cash and bitcoins.

We should all send it to joe as a correction; I plan to.
Edit: formatted for copy and paste with an intro: (this formatting will preserve paragraphs when copy and pasted)
    Hey Joe, I saw your letter to federal regulators about that dangerous currency, and it had some errors in it; So I took the liberty of correcting them for you.
    
    The corrected letter is as follows:
    
    ***
    
    Dear Secretary Lew, Chairwoman Yellen, Commissioner Curry, Acting Chairman Wetjen, Chairman Gruenberg, Chairwoman White:
    
    I write today to express my concerns about Cash. This paper currency is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly unstable and disruptive to our economy. For the reasons outlined below, I urge regulators to take appropriate action to limit the abilities of this highly unstable currency.
    
    By way of background, Cash is a currency that has gained notoriety in recent months due to its relation to illegal transactions. Each Cash is defined by a paper bill, which allows for anonymous and irreversible transactions. The very features that make Cash attractive to some also attract criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement. Due to Cash’s anonymity, the market has been extremely susceptible to muggers and scam artists stealing millions from Cash users. Anonymity combined with Cash’s ability to finalize transactions quickly, makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse fraudulent transactions.
    
    Cash has also become a haven for individuals to buy black market items. Individuals are able to anonymously purchase items such as drugs and weapons illegally. The clear ends of Cash for either transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling make me weary of its use. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued a report just this month stating, “There is widespread concern about the Cash’s possible impact on national currencies, its potential for criminal misuse, and the implications of its use for taxation.” Before the U.S. gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.
    
    ***
    
    I urge you to submit this corrected letter as soon as humanly possible. This dangerous currency has to be stopped!

what exactly *is* a fractional bitcoin reserve?
do you mean not actually holding enough coins for the amount of balances?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:27:44
You put 1 bitcoin up for trade at high price on totallynotascamexchange.net hoping to cash in on the next price bump and drop
totallynotascamexchange drops from the planet.
you acting quickly, take your private key and import it in bittorrent-qt and transfer your 1 bitcoin to your wallet.
crisis avoid.
Just about EVERY service that allows you to both spend and gain bitcoin, from exchanges to provability fair betting sites, holds a bitcoin balance for each user.
Not storing btc on websites is impossible.

pif is a known format used by viruses to spread.
While its not strictly an executable format, the dos shell code interpreter that reads it will run any dos based executable stored in it if you run/doubleclick it.
If you downloaded the pif file, you might be infected.
If you clicked on the download progress in chrome while it was downloading, you ARE infected
If you tried to open the file in any way. You ARE infected.

why would he even need to use other exchanges? dude runs his own and has a wallet full of bitcoins, bank accounts full of multiple currencies and can rig the shown buy or sell orders. 
He could run the exchange version of a ponzi scheme. 
buy bitcoins with customers cash to keep price high, run out of funds? sell all the coins triggering panic sells than omg its soo low buys, brings more money into the system.
rinse, repeat.
this would explain why its always been so hard to withdraw cash, but not bitcoins.

I have a small credit union bank account, and it worked for me. So i think they have added quick a few banks since you signed up.
I just changed my password with my bank, gave them a new one, verified, and changed it back.

Yeah, everyone knows you can steal ~~digital~~ money from ~~a bank~~ anyone without... ~~Wait... you need to be an authorized processor to move digital fiat.~~ 
Ok, well it's still subject to use in illegal transac~~... Oh wait, you can't set up merchant accounts without an application process that includes an underwriter...~~
Well it's still totally volatile, that's why the prices at the store are adjusted constantly with the price swings... wait... that's not right either!
Well at least there's good ol anonymity! ~~Oh wait, every transaction requires a paper trail and banks in the US require identification to open bank accounts by law!~~
Ok ok ok, I can just take a wad of cash ~~and deposit in my bank~~ Spend it and nobody will be wiser! ~~Oh dammit, there's the IRS!~~
Well even if Bitcoin is better than cash it's still not as good as the digital fiat in the banks! (And lets just ignore the 1-1 association between digital fiat and paper fiat)
~~Damn~~ :(

Actually its a virus.
It will take you to a page to download a pdf. but what you will get is a pif.
pifs can contain dos programs, dos programs can contain modern windows programs, you get the idea.

How cute:

* [Smartphone market share: 21%](
* [Web traffic share: 9.6+1.23(mobile)](
Apple is a thorn on the technology sector's side.

I doubt it, you can sell on coinbase for more than it would cost to buy at bitstamp. (more or less, the price jumps so after the 1% fee it's sometimes worth it, sometimes not.)
So I bet they are getting quite a bit of incoming bitcoins.
