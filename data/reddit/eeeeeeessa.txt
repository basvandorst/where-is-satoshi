never mind I'm sure I'll remember it

literally nobody is upset about this

good one dipshit. google didn't IPO until well after the tech bubble burst and amazon only went from a dollar to 100 dollars but that was only after posting a profit and actually having a business model, so yeah, I'm absolutely 100% right. 
I can go ahead and call you a loser now.

this is an amazing post. I'm going to screenshot and timestamp this because people in the future are going to want a raw look at just how irrational markets can be.
also, if you're buying bitcoins I hate to break it to you, but you're the average joe. bitcoins do not make you special. not even a little bit.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:52:07
lol using what as your point of reference?
this guy has a fundamental misunderstand of how "the markets" work.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:51:07
lol maybe it was just a guy who sold 3 pizzas 4 years ago trying to cash out. market manipulation. jesus christ you people are stupid as shit.

hundreds of stocks went from a dollar to over 1K during the tech bubble. you know how many of those stocks are still alive and well? zero. oh, and btw, every single one of them had some "amazing technology" behind it that was sure to "change the world". guess what dude, bitcoin is the same. its not that impressive. nobody wants it, and nobody wants to use it. 
lol lets use our money to buy more money! how fucking first world is that?
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:57:26
also hilarious is that those are the only 2 names you know (you could have mentioned priceline in fact that would have been a better name to drop but you're pretty clueless) when there were hundreds if not thousands of these hot tech stocks going "to the moon" and back again. Of course back then space travel wasn't a big deal so people referred to it as "getting on the train".
I'd ask you to think about that for a minute but I'm not sure you possess the capabilities. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:48:32
uh huh. so where do you get these magic volume bars that tell you exactly who and where a bitcoin goes to?
what I'm getting at is bitcoiners like yourself are easily manipulated ;)
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:16:20
zero dollars. I think you misunderstood my post. I apologize, I'll say exactly what I mean next time to make it easier for you ;)
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:47:28
you guys are always staring at the sell walls like those matter. the only thing that matters is what prints. look at a 1 minute chart for bitstamp. you see that large volume line at 11:46 EST? That was a 6000 coin sell order and it absolutely broke your market. All this talk of bearwhales and market manipulation are total bullshit. 6000 coins can break your market in a single minute. think about that. 6000 coins IS NOT THAT MANY BITCOINS.
Some of you people are fools and many of you will never learn.

did you read his post? he's talking about "average joe" like he's a real person. this guy is clearly mentally ill.

thanks I was waiting for your permission 
fucking loser
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:10:16
whats more important:
my money actually being worth something
or my money having some really cool technology?
what a stupid fucking question.
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:57:49
no, I don't think so. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:54:52
you're an idiot dude. I don't even know where to begin so I won't.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:45:50
uh huh. so wait chinese money can only be used by the chinese? since when?
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:58:59
oh right the volatility will just magically fix itself. cool. when did they add that feature to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:08:18


nah, they're just going to the same dipshits who bought at 10 dollars and 1000 dollars
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:06:48
so wait, according to the OP as long as people like to speculate bitcoin will be a broken market?
lmao good luck with that dude.
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:32:19


o ya? did all your chinese friends tell you that one?
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:55:14
maybe he's running a meta strategy to make you think he is artificially lowering the price to get more dipshits who love to "buy low" and "beat the banksters" to provide him with buy side liquidity.
but of course that wouldn't go along with those castles in the sky you built so just ignore me I guess ;)
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:09:27
I got a mailing list that tells my readers when and how much BTC will drop/rise based on incoming buy/sell orders on all the major exchanges. 
PM me you email address and I can get you on it, I'll even waive the first months fee since you're a fellow redditor :)
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:50:10
hey would RemindMe! work if I wanted it to say remind me in 2 months that you're a faggot?
