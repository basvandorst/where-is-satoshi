Thank you for this very sensible post. IMHO, your decision making should be a model for how people approach investing into bitcoin.
My impression of your post, is that you are interested in a high purpose than money. Which I applaud.
What gives me confidence in btc is the people behind bitcoin have the autonomy, opportunity to master a skill to build tools that benefit people other than themselves. I believe that this is a formula that cannot lose and  could be a new blueprint for an economic model for the "Fourth Industrial Revolution".
I would hope, as bitcoin's price rises, that the people earn their financial independence use some of their time to contribute to Bitcoin in positive and meaningful ways that they enjoy and get great satisfaction from. We, as a community, have the opportunity, to create a positive feedback loop for humanity to flourish.
EDIT: Proofread and corrected.

You are right, the crypto economy is going to grow parallel to the traditional economy.
It will be impossible to tax and humanity is going to have to figure out a new way of cooperating to construct strong social institutions.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:54:15
You raise a good point. The crypto economy is going to be very hard to tax. 
I think a consumption tax is going to be put in place as additional taxes on luxury goods.
Then those products will start being sold directly for crypto and the governments will eventually starve.
If people want the equivalent government services for society, they are going to have to give to them voluntary.

Is this bad? Cultural evolution is inevitable.

40 000k by next year? Man if that's the case, the next halving in 19/20(?) is going to be absolute fucking insanity.

Do you think it's healthy to view yourself better than others? Most people don't understand how money works because they don't have to. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:10:25


Only the amount that you will need or agree with. I'm pretty sure you will settle on the most efficient system. 
This is still the early days my friend. The protocols will be come layered just like the internet did.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:03:46
As bitcoin is an open source project, open to everyone,is it a good idea for a small collective of people to horde it to themselves? Not only is it impractical, it is impossible.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:38:59
Why do we need a set amount of nodes before layers? Increased functionality is increased functionality isn't it?
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:50:10
Yeap, exactly that.
It is really remarkable to see. I've heard this is similar to a game called werewolf and mafia? I think. I haven't played either though.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:49:14
Also, BCH will readjust it's difficulty driving miners back to btc.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:16:21
Or maybe one ideal isn't better than the other and both ideals provide ideas for society to benefit from?
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:11:01
Let alone open source money with no boarders.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:09:39
I think it you could make something fit. :)

Why can't we have balance? Supply and demand markets and have it illegal to dump toxic chemicals into the water supply?
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:00:53
I'm very glad you posted this. I would like to see this community organize around principles that makes bitcoin amazing. I would like to see us be more accepting of forks. As a open source project, people may fork as they please. If a fork succeeds then so be it. What really gives me confidence is the developers on core. They have autonomy, an opportunity to master the subject and purpose, bitcoin is going to be such a massive boon for humanity. This is what I will always bet on.

The laws of physics would argue that purple cannot exist without blue and red. 
That being said, Socialism and Capitalism are just ideas. That is it, at their core, are a combination of different and similar ideas. Private ownership vs public ownership, and they share the same idea of human production, among other ideas. The component ideas of Socialism and Capitalism aren't exclusive.
Getting back to OP, I am advocating they don't have to pick one idea over another and are free to pick, choose and mix the different ideas that Socialism and Capitalism are built on. To claim that it isn't possible, goes against the very nature that makes ideas possible.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:12:11
I agree it's a hard problem. I sort of feel that we, as humans, will find out as it is built. We are figuring it out as we go.
When there is a will, there is a way.

Patience my friend.

Bitcoin is open to everyone. People with shortsighted vision and long term vision. When this project is available to all of humanity, I don't see any good coming from abstracting people into labels that you don't disagree with. Everyone is welcome to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:24:16
I share your opinion. When this stuff really catches on main stream....Damn.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:11:48
Agreed, bitcoin is an open system. Open doesn't mean everyone except large corporations.

Thanks for this post. I was just wondering how Trezor was doing this.
I am quite the fan of Trezor. Very big fan. One thousand hearts.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:48:21
Might be a good time for you to look up your answer and undergo some research on the topic. It may alleviate your fear.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:06:11
Well unfortunately for you, this is a natural by product of an open source project. Branches are a natural part of the territory. Take a look at linux.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:54:47
Ah, I better understand your perspective now and agree with you. Ty.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:36:24


Isn't having no beliefs just having an open mind? Why do these sets of beliefs we are discussing have to conflict? Why can't they strike balance with one another? Such as social democracy. That position seems to be doing well for the Nordic countries.
I disagree that western democracy isn't an implementation of both. Aren't the western democracies classified as social democracies?
From wikipedia:
Social democracy is a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy, as well as a policy regime involving a commitment to representative democracy, measures for income redistribution, and regulation of the economy in the general interest and welfare state provisions.[1][2][3] Social democracy thus aims to create the conditions for capitalism to lead to greater democratic, egalitarian and solidaristic outcomes; and is often associated with the set of socioeconomic policies that became prominent in Northern and Western Europe—particularly the Nordic model in the Nordic countries—during the latter half of the 20th century.[4][5]
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:21:17


DO you? Do you really have to pick a certain belief? Is their a regulation to enforce that?


Reality disagrees. Look at western "democracy". There are some free market fundamentals and regulations and taxation. It's almost as if a balance has been struck and both ideals have benefits and downsides.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:07:22
Who cares really? Time will sort this out, and humanity will settle for the most efficient system or systems that come out of the crypto space.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:47:28
I grabbed a quick you tube for you.
This is a computer game version. I like the board game version. It's really something you have to play with people in he same room, imho.

I am pro segwit 1x. Just normal bitcoin. I ran a bip148 node. I would like to make sure I am running a node for segwit 1x. Do I just upgrade to the latest core software?

I'm very interested in seeing how the banks handle their very own napster moment. They have seen first hand what happens to entire industrys that don't adapt when technology develops that dis-intermediates them. I'm sure they have some people working for them that know that it is time to adapt or die.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:45:46
Does schnorr fix this? An optimization on transactions with multiple inputs?
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:06:44
It's about compromising convenience and security. A lot of people feel the hardware balances both virtues.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:13:59
Stupid or just uninformed? Is bitcoin only available to people of higher intelligence? Are we elite? Better than our fellow humans?
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:11:55
If you buy before, you can sell your forked coins. :)

Damn. That is one of the coolest concepts that I have come across.
Blessed be thy internet.

I would say just buy a little bit every month. Put it away in an inconvenient paper wallet if your worried you will impulsively spend some gains.

We share pretty much the same view. Couldn't agree more.

I'm really curious if [Pareto distribution]( is going to apply to price of bitcoin.
Bitcoin is coming up to 80% mined really soon I think. I looked for a calculator online but didn't come up with anything.

I really like this design. I would take the Bitcoin off. They yellow B in the background takes care of what this is.

Aren't futures just contracts that traders swap? These guys aren't purchasing BTC with this are they? They are just betting on the price.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:07:19
I agree. I'm wondering if those same speculators will be able to hold onto their btc until 2024?

Okay that is very interesting. I didn't really see this as providing insurance. But now that you explain this it makes sense and can be very useful for more tangible things. I've heard of corn futures and oil futures, but I didn't really understand them until you explained it like insurance.
Very interesting. I'm very much looking forward to how this unfolds. I hope the cypto etf's eventually have a lot of competition to push the fees down.

Honestly, I hope this fork happens and I can dump my segwit2x coins to the suckers.
Those guys bought my bacsh at 700-800. LOL.

I don't recommend doing this.

I've heard stirrings of this trend. Bitcoin seems to be making a good case for paying affiliate marketers. 
I imagine it would be ideal for google and the like to payout ad-revenue to people across the world. Maybe google has their own thing?
