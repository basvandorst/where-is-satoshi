Oh.  I was ending up at a different link.  For a moment, I couldn't connect and so I accidentally looked at a different tab I had open.  Now it's making more sense.  Thank you for this.  I'm going to do some clicking.
@_date: 2016-09-30 07:26:58


I assure you that I have.  I can't promise that I'm not stupid but I do promise that I'm trying in earnest if that makes any difference.


Thank you in advance.


Okay first question: can I assume that the software which manages my wallet will create more addresses as needed over time?  You're not implying that there is a finite number of addresses, just that by default the software will set me up with a handful of addresses, so I don't have to generate them fresh each time (until I run out), right?


I have never sent funds using a normal bank but I will accept you at your word here.  (When I need to pay someone, I either give them cash or I go to the supermarket for a money order and I mail it to the person.)


I am going to rephrase that.  Please tell me if I am right or wrong.  You are saying that the software on my computer which controls my wallet is able to write data in the standard bitcoin blockchain format.  So it writes data in this format which says that x number of BTC have been removed from &lt;something&gt; and added to &lt;something.&gt;  (Are these somethings addresses?  wallets?)  
This data is added to the blockchain, either directly or through an intermediary (depending on whether my software client is a full node or not) and now everyone can see that this transaction has happened.
Is this correct?  And what are the &lt;something&gt;s?


Wait, slow down!  *If* what I wrote above is true then I understand "those bitcoins left your [my] wallet."  But I definitely do not understand how they are "now in my [your] wallet."
Imagine that your wallet is one of these hardware wallets everyone is telling me about.  How did it get infused with the x number of BTC?  What actually *happens* here?
I think this is really two questions:
1) What makes it official that I own the BTC?  (maybe... the fact that the blockchain now has this transaction data?)
2) How do I get control over that BTC?  (I understand this cryptographically, but not practically)


I am in the process of doing this now, thanks to your earlier message (which I initially misread but am now on track with.)  Unfortunately, it's been 20 minutes and my testbitcoin hasn't appeared yet, so it may be a very long test.  But still worth it.
@_date: 2016-09-19 10:48:30
What are you on about?
@_date: 2016-09-30 07:10:39
When I say "verified and legal," I only mean that law enforcement doesn't have to worry because the transaction can be traced back to me.
It seems like you mean something different.  What do you mean by "legal and verified?" 
And what do you mean "no one will accept you legal and verified transfer?"  Are you saying that there are people who would reject a BTC transfer if they don't know the person's name?  That seems funny.  If someone tries to give me cash, I don't ask for ID.
@_date: 2016-09-30 10:10:06


But I thought we agreed that what a wallet does is search the blockchain for transactions belonging to a specific address and then display them.
Trezor doesn't do that.  The software on your computer does that.  It seems like the Trezor just signs the transactions.
Oh shit: you need to use myTrezor website?  I thought you could use any of these instead:
@_date: 2016-09-30 07:51:23
Would they be your  choice for fiat&lt;-&gt;btc or would you recommend another for that?  Preferably one that doesn't require a copy of my ID on file.  (Name OK, TIN ok if absolutely necessary, but not my photo or ID preferably.)
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:18:18
Thank you.  I'm convinced.
@_date: 2016-09-13 07:59:33
I don't know what this means.  I'm not trying to be difficult but I've been doing a lot of reading and this is the first I'm hearing about this.  Can you explain more about what you mean or how this would work?
@_date: 2016-09-13 07:56:45
I don't understand what you are saying.
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:54:23


I understand that.  But what about an online wallet that allows me to store my private key offline?  That is still not a good idea, correct?  Because the website could be hacked.
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:23:27
Cool, thank you.
A follow up: *how* did you move them to a Trezor?  I just don't get the concept of moving things that appear on a web page to a local wallet.  It's not like you just download it, so what do you actually *do*?
Another follow-up: did Coinbase require you to send them a copy of your ID?
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:46:19


I have a few on my computer right now and haven't decided which one to use.  Partly because I don't understand sending and receiving well enough to try.
I looked at MyCelium but it looks like it's for smartphones.  I don't have a smartphone.  Do you know one that handles this testnetwallet for a computer?
(Also, the MyCelium webpage seems to assume I already understand this stuff really well.  It's talking about all kinds of features and new things coming online that are over my head... for now, at least.)
@_date: 2016-09-13 08:21:49


That sounds pretty great.  Of course, for me to "be sure", as you put it, I'll need more than a marketing blurb in reddit or on your website.  Can you please send me a whitepaper or other technical specifications of these security standards, including the type of encryption you use?  I want to be sure it's a well-known algorithm that has been thoroughly vetted by the community, and not a proprietary algorithm that you built in house and hasn't been peer-reviewed.
Also, how many employees have access to this encrypted information and how are they vetted?
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:56:12
You are not giving me context for what you're typing.  I have no idea if you're even in the same thread that i'm in anymore.
@_date: 2016-09-13 08:23:47
Thank you for your help.  You said:


As a noob, this sounds vague to me.  What will it look like to me to "have the coins?"  And how do I "send to trezor?"
I'm really confused by this whole wallet thing, especially when it's in my pocket.  Can you give a high-level overview of this?  I'm not dumb, just really new.
@_date: 2016-09-19 10:50:59
That's very helpful.
So okay, how about if I had an encrypted thumbdrive?  one with good encryption, not some silly over-the-counter thing?  Would that be good?
I'm not clear on what a Trezor does actually.  The website is all marketing talk as far as I can tell.  You said that operations run inside the Trezor.  But I saw a video where a guy was saying that the Trezor can't be hacked because nothing runs inside it, it just acts as storage.
Can you clear that up?
@_date: 2016-09-30 09:44:50


In what sense(s) are you using "wallet" here?
@_date: 2016-09-13 07:58:21
Huh?  What are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-09-30 08:42:42
I see!  So calling a Trezor a "hardware wallet" is misleading in a completely different way.
It's misleading because the Trezor performs a different function entirely from the software wallets/viewers.  The Trezor only signs the transaction.  It doesn't do any of the other things that a software "wallet" does.  
Got it, all thanks to you.  Thanks for hanging in there with me.
By the way, my testbitcoins have started to come through, so I see the process now.
@_date: 2016-09-13 07:55:45
You make some sense and thank you.  For investing, you make perfect sense.
But to your point, I don't think you're right that it would matter what it looks like when I *sell* the BTC for fiat.  You said "you have no way of proving that you are not a cocaine dealer, gambler or something like that."  Well, who would care?  The IRS wouldn't really care if I was a gambler or whatever, so long as I pay my taxes.  At least, I think that's the case.
So my plan is to keep meticulous records of anything I tumble.  
I think I'll tumble everything I spend because I don't like the idea that anyone in the world (now or in the future) would be able to look up my transactions on the blockchain.  I know that using a new address gives some privacy, but what about 15 years from now, when - hypothetically - my exchange gets hacked and all addresses are connected to a person?  I don't want my granchildren to know that I'm not the badass I pretend to be in my stories but am actually a Star Wars nerd with a secret collection of Matchbox cars in my closet!
Even if I never spent anything, I'm sure I would tumble some just because I'm a geek and I want to really how it all works.
@_date: 2016-09-13 07:58:04
Can you give me a summary of why you like Kraken.com?  I have so many recommendations, it's very hard to choose.
Also, would you use several different exchanges (like 5k each?) or use one for all of the money?
@_date: 2016-09-30 07:35:29


I don't have a bank card but I understand what you're saying.


I see!  So it's not that anything gets "sent" to my wallet.  And it's not that the BTC is stored in my wallet"Wallet" is actually a bad term.  It's more like a bank statement viewer!
This is what I hadn't wrapped my brainball around!!
What's really happening is that my wallet downloads the transaction data from the blockchain and makes my local ledger match the blockchain, for the addresses that it has cryptographically strong evidence to believe that I own.
I think the light bulb just went on.  Can you verify that what I wrote above is correct or am I still not getting it?
EDIT: the light bulb went "on."
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:36:10
I've never done a bitcoin transaction so I don't know what to do with a QR code.  I thought QR codes were things for smartphones?  
Also how does trezor "provide you" with this QR code?  The screen doesn't look big enough to show one.  Or am I misunderstanding what "qr code" means?
Also what do you mean by "scan and send" and "copy paste the payment address?"
These are all very vague.  Can you give me a detailed explanation?  (Also, please assume no smartphone.)
EDIT: spelling
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:57:36
Ah.  I understand now.  I don't have any idea what we were talking about but I know the concept of "Dollar Cost Averaging."  Thank you.
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:54:38


That is what I'm trying to do, adn why I asked the follow-up.  The Wiki page on the subject tells me that it's an alternative blockchain, and that you can go to that other link to play with it.  Okay.
And I go to that other link and I see a blank (zero balance) wallet and a button to send or receive.  Which brings me back to my first question (and the title of this post), which is How do I "Send" and "Receive?"
When I click, I'm asked for an address.  If I understood how to create an address, that might be useful.  But no matter how man times I ask that question here, no one seems to want to help.
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:52:35


But if it is as you are describing, then:
a) I could just store my private key in any USB drive
b) My BTC would still be in my car (a.k.a. web wallet) so could still vanish if the website is hacked.
Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:49:24
That's not correct.  My reasons concern security.  And any security pro knows that disclosing the algorithms is not a security risk.
If you do not know that, then you do not understand security.  I don't know why anyone would care how many certificates you have but I am concerned with whether you follow security protocols, not whether you have a good marketing campaign.
@_date: 2016-09-30 08:39:54
Interesting.  Thank you.
I wonder if there are reliable exchanges without kyc rules (at least when the transfer comes from a registered bank that they can trust.)
@_date: 2016-09-23 01:17:49
Excellent.  Thank you for explaining.  
Do I still need a software wallet?  How do I send and receive?  The mechanics are confusing me.  What goes in and comes out of the Trezor?
@_date: 2016-09-13 07:42:51
I looked at itBit just now.  Seems pretty fancy.  
Do you know anything about their ID requirements (I can't see that info without creating an account)?  
Also, do you know if they do any capital gains calculations?  Since they're for investors, it seems like they might handle that and that would be very helpful.
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:43:02
I've never used an online bank account or an ATM.  I always just go to the counter, so I don't know if I understand totally but I have some questions.


It "shows up" where?  Where would I see it?


Where do I "enter" this bitcoin address?
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:53:16
I still have no idea what you're trying to say.  You are writing phrases with no context.
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:40:58
This makes no sense.  You're using vague terms again.  What do you mean by "changed to qr codes?"
What do you mean by "you scan them?"  Are you saying I need to buy a scanner?  That can't be possible, can it?
Where do you "input how much to send?"
I'm asking for specifics and you're being vague.  Thank you for trying but if you can't do better than this, please don't continue to reply.
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:50:32
I don't know what you're referring to.  You didn't include the thing I asked a question about in your reply, so I don't know where we were at in our conversation.
Did I say that it was hard for me to believe that something is possible?  Well, maybe but I don't recall.
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:47:50
That makes sense.  Thank you.
@_date: 2016-09-30 09:44:19
That doesn't make sense.  Banks don't get sued for what their clients use the money for.  Unless they're in on it and they're violating the law to allow their clients to open accounts.
But if there are not laws about Bitcoin exchanges, then there's nothing for them to worry about.
I think?
@_date: 2016-09-30 10:10:56
I gotta go.  I'll check back tomorrow.  Thanks for everything.
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:49:43


Also: how do I know what bitcoin address to send to and (imagine that I'm using a Trezor that I have in my pocket) how does it get to the thing in my pocket?
I'm trying to understand the mechanics, not the high-level view.
@_date: 2016-09-13 08:17:21
Do you know what sort of ID requirements these exchanges have?  It seemed like I'd have to open an account to find out.
Obviously I'm already fully vetted by my bank, and I don't want a lot of hassle if I can avoid it.
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:55:39
I've probably watched seven hours of videos and read at least two hundred pages of docs.  Probably more because I've done it for 2-3 hours per day for the past month.  I have a wonderful *technical* understanding of BTC but I have not yet found any resource that explains how to actually interact with it.  Can you recommend one, or are you just talking?
@_date: 2016-09-13 07:46:44
This was the clearest reply I received.  Thank you.  Some follow up questions, regarding your "two things":
1) a) What do you mean by SAR, BSA, CTR?  Also, what do you mean about "reporting limits?"  That's a new concept to me.  I thought the $10,000 cutoff was just having to do with being flagged for further scrutiny (whether in one lump sum or 10,000 through the year) but didn't know I had to report anything?  Or are you referring to the bank's requirement to report the transactions to the IRS?
2) Is a good software wallet okay?  I'm encrypting my hard drive and backing it up.  So is hardware really necessary in your opinion?
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:26:35
(BTW, I wasn't asking about exchanges vs. Trezor but software vs. hardware, just to be clear.)
@_date: 2016-09-30 07:45:31


What does "kyc" stand for?


I don't understand what you are saying here.  What "seller?"  You mean the exchange?  I assume the exchange will be comfortable accepting fiat from any registered bank.
EDIT: added the following:


I don't know what you mean.  I will reply if you want to explain.
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:47:57


Okay, I'm looking at this site.  After creating the account, I see that I can send or receive.  But... send/receive what, to where, and how?  That's the whole question I'm trying to understand the answer to. :)
@_date: 2016-09-30 08:04:58
I get almost everything.  But the hardware "wallet" is still confusing to me.
I see that an online "wallet" is really just an online ledger viewer.  I see that a software wallet on my computer is just a local ledger viewer, like opening up my monthly bank statement and looking at my current balance and transaction history.  Okay, cool.
But what about a hardware "wallet?"  It can't just be a bank-statement-in-my-pocket, because they don't have a big enough display.  What exactly are they doing that's different from the other two wallets?  (I'm on the trezor website right now trying to find this out for myself, incidentally.)
Also: I hate that they use the term "wallet."  That threw me off for a long time!  I couldn't connect what I was reading with other stuff I was reading.
Maybe I should just ask: what function in all of this does a Trezor serve?
@_date: 2016-09-30 07:56:45


More like: I've done 2-3 hours of research every evening, about 4-5 days/week, for the last month.  So I may have exaggerated but not by a whole lot.


I have not.  Every two weeks, I cash my paycheck at the same counter I've been going to since I got my first bank account when I was 10 and made money raking leaves.  Once, they sent me an ATM card and I handed it back to them the following Friday, cut in half.  They have never sent me any others (except for lots of free offer credit cards that aren't actually activated until you apply, which I have never done.)
When I started buying things online a couple of years ago I started to buy Amazon gift cards (with cash) and using those.
@_date: 2016-09-30 09:43:21
Interesting.  I was reading a review (they got an A-) that said otherwise.  Fuck it's hard to know who to trust out here.  In the real world, the villagers can always pay someone a visit if he steals their money.  
Thank you for the answer.
@_date: 2016-09-13 08:24:22
What do you mean by "cost averaging?"
