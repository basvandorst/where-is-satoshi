Why not spend ten dollars from each paycheck. At least it may add up to something. Faucets are a waste of time and energy.

I would post what part of town u r in and meet somebody personally. Or check craigslist. Everytown seems to have a few people selling coins.

In the summer two things frequently happen. Crime rates increase and ice cream sales increase. Does that mean eating ice cream causes more crime?
Those two events (price and asics) may not be related..

Please don't forget to post a simple hello to the FBI in your posts. No need to make them feel unwelcome as they log this conversation.

We have bigger problems than losing a few bucks if something like that happens...

Did vos ever figure out the cash for US citizens. I remember that being an issue.

Capitalone 360 accounts do not have foreign transaction fees. I think charles Schwab is the same. Let a standard ATM dispense local currency and have peace of mind. I think Clark Howard has a bunch of tips like that on his website that is fully up to date. This is a normal problem that has been discussed to death on every travel site...

Just personal preference nothing bad about localbitcoins

Anybody know anything about this company?
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:17:46
I like the dude that wants to use his mortgage line. Lol
I'm shocked wf said anything. I am fairly certain they are working with moolah and his site that sells doge. 
I use capital one 360 and have zero problems

What does charity have to do with a legit site? Hitler went to church and did charitable deeds. Should we have trusted him?

Not sure why casacius hasn't released the new round wallets. That was supposed to happen a little while ago but hasn't.
Why not just use a paper wallet? Why carry a quarter when u can have a dollar bill....

This is one of the best topics I have seen in at least six months

Throw it in rice for a week. Water should bother it that much. That's the advantage of solid state.
