Income is measured in dollars. If you make 0 dollars you are taxed 0 dollars. It doesn't matter what the coins are worth if you never cash them in you have profited exactly 0 dollars.  
The IRS has absolutely no way of taxing you on forked coins if you never cash in.

If you don't make any money, there's nothing to tax. I don't understand how people can argue you have to pay taxes after a fork even if you don't cash out the new coin. Even if that were somehow true, there is no possible way the IRS would know how much Bitcoin you have, how much the fork is worth, etc... You are never taxed on "potential value" only real income.
I realize we're in agreement here, I'm mostly just thinking aloud.

I actually tried sending the coins from GDAX, not directly from coinbase. GDAX tells me the wallet address is invalid, and won't let me send any coins. I'll try again from coinbase, thanks.

I'm not really the kind of day trader you're probably trying to talk to, I don't sit at my PC and trade all day for profits. I have a full-time job and I'll usually make a trade or 2 every day when I come home. Any coins I'm trading just sit in GDAX and get bought or sold as I see fit, I don't really ever transfer to my bank.  
  
I only trade a small portion, and hodl the rest. The coins I'm holding sit in an electrum wallet 24/7. I can usually make $10-50 worth of BTC in a day by trading and it's fun to watch it grow. I just focus on making a small steady profit every day, no need to fret about min-maxing profits and tearing my hair out over "what could have been." Just now I bought $300 worth of coins at $17,290 and sold them a few minutes later at $17,000 for a few dollars in profit. Within 30 minutes BTC dipped to 16.5k, I could have easily doubled my profits if I waited a bit longer, but who cares. I'm not perfect timing the market and I came out ahead, that's all that matters. If I make $10 a day every day I'm adding $3600 to my portfolio every year, and that's good enough for me.  
  
I'm actually considering diversifying into ETH and maybe some other coins as well. It's never a good idea to have all your eggs in one basket. I realize I went off on a tangent there, but let me know if you have any other questions I'm happy to help.

Few days ago I tried to move my coin from a legacy wallet to a SegWit wallet. Spent $1.00 in fees and it took over 20 hours to be confirmed. Now I just have some coins I bought sitting in coinbase because I can't transfer them to the SegWit wallet :c

Because I know how much money I initially invested, and the only other relevant number is my total profit at the end of the year. I don't want to disclose exactly how much I've put into Bitcoin, but let's say $1000 as an example. If I trade a bunch and cash out a year later with $5000, I know I've profited $4000 and need to pay taxes appropriately. The individual trades don't matter. It's just the final profit number minus how much I've invested.

14k confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:46:43
Taxes are something you pay AFTER you convert your bitcoins to dollars. Say you cash out with 10k at the end of the year after investing 1k total, then you profited 9k and pay taxes on it. The IRS can verify if they need to that $1,000 left your bank account to a bitcoin exchange, and then $10,000 were deposited back into your account after some time. You don't necessarily need to keep track of each trade, just the total dollars out minus total dollars in.

You only pay taxes on the income. So if I tried to cash out my RomeoCoin for USD I'd have to pay taxes on the amount of USD I'm transferring to my bank. If I don't give a shit about RomeoCoin and never cash out, I don't pay any taxes because I had no income. You don't just make a fork and tax everyone's potential gains.

He said 10k before the fork or after the dust settles. That could take months. If we start getting closer to the fork and we still haven't hit 10k it's likely going to be a while.

Increasing the block size isn't a solution to the scaling problem, it's just kicking the can down the road.

The blockchain is around 150GB right now. The shittiest budget laptop from 2010 has more hard drive space than that, in fact I don't even know if you can buy hard drives smaller than 150GB anymore (except SSDs but that's besides the point). I agree with you that a significant block size increase will reduce the number of nodes, leading to centralization, and ideally the block size should stay as small as it can as long as it doesn't negatively affect Bitcoin users.
However, we've now gotten to the point where being a Bitcoin user is very expensive. Increasing the block size the way BCH did is not a solution, it's a band aid. It's the equivelent of raising the debt ceiling to "fix" a spending problem. But with SegWit the users see a huge boost to confirmation time, and fees drop dramatically, but we have to compromise with 1.8MB blocks. In my mind, that's a very modest and acceptable increase given the current fee situation. LN would help more than anything, but SegWit is a solution NOW, and Bitcoin is having scaling problems NOW.
 I'd love for LN to release and fix all our problems, but based on my understanding (which I admit is limited) that also opens a new can of worms with the possibility of channel centralization. I do really appreciate all the work you've devoted to Bitcoin. Users like me just get to reap the benefits, but a lot of people don't understand the blood, sweat, and tears that goes into a project like this.

Maybe because very religious couples would not consider divorce an option even if they hate each other. I know a few couples that don't even speak to each other but are technically still married because of their faith.

Honest question, do most people in 3rd world countries making $6/day have access to computers and the internet in order to use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:11:05
I don't understand, 150GB per year for the entire blockchain? Hard drives are like $40/TB right now and they're only getting cheaper. A single Bitcoin transaction almost costs more in fees than the cost of storing the entire blockchain. If bitcoin is expensive to trade, it also becomes centralized. Nodes aren't the only thing that need to be cheap. Don't get me wrong, I'm not on the big block side, but SegWit adoption isn't in danger of centralizing Bitcoin in any meaningful manner.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:38:45
1gb blocks would have the blockchain growing by 50TB/yr. Nodes would become insanely centralized very quickly. It's not Bitcoin if you rely on a centralized 3rd party to verify all transactions.

As someone newer to bitcoin what does this mean? I read the in depth guide on SegWit but my understanding is still basic. Does this have any effect on the 2x fork in November?  
Reading [this]( gave me a better understanding

2 hours isn't bad considering any time I have to send money to anyone through the bank it takes a minimum of 2 business days. I'll pay a friend on Thursday and hopefully they'll have it by Monday. 2 hours would be a godsend right now.

Drugs are valuable because people want to do them whether they're legal or not. Bitcoin's only value is that it can be exchanged for other currencies. If you can no longer exchange it for dollars before widespread adoption, it's completely useless.
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:02:59
I can invent my own currency that uses whatever security measures I want it to. Just because no one can take it from me doesn't make it valuable. Bitcoin has value because everyone agrees it does, and that's it. If one day everyone just decided they didn't want Bitcoins anymore, it no longer has value.

That app has 1.5 stars with over 80% of users saying it's horribly broken and doesn't work at all. I also use a local credit union, not a commercial bank so they likely aren't supported.
