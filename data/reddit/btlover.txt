Well said. We need lightening but let’s not damage the reputation of Bitcoin to rush it out.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:55:33
Haha, this was way too funny!
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:35:49
100% agreed, the tone of his writing says it all really. He discusses absolutely nothing about the merits of Bitcoin and just completely disregards it with nonsense he found online as ‘research’ for his article. He didn’t even try to take an unbiased stance and this new technology and asset class. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:26:41
I used to respect his opinion about traditional finance but his article about Bitcoin is poorly researched and a joke at best. It does indeed seem that he is salty by the tone of his article and his illogical arguments. Such a shame! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:59:34
Haha, 100%! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:34:00
I agree with your point about many people buying Bitcoin for the wrong reason. And that is FOMO. FOMO is the wrong reason to buy into this new asset class. This is much more than FOMO. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:34:46
Probably not, they have been in this game long enough to know the score.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:24:21
Yeah IOTA has no issues with the pricing of their token due to it being broken down to MIOTA. I wish BTC would do the same to make it seem more reasonable to adopters.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:32:46
I love the freedom that Bitcoin and crypto gives but you are right that not everyone wants to hold it themselves. No doubt there will be services that will do that for you or the process for storage will be fool proof and you want even have to think about it. 
Things have improved massively over the years and will no doubt continue to do so in terms of user friendliness :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:55:03
I read that but am not sure what ico he is referring too? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:02:57
Haha, I’ve been involved for a while and this is so true. I don’t even care about the volatility anymore! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:50:33
Many thanks for this video! I have been in crypto for a while and could not agree more with the points you discussed. 
I like how you tie everything together to give a brilliant over all view of why the legacy financial system is due for massive disruption. 
I hope you post more insightful knowledge like this. I will be sharing this video with friends and family of mine :) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:59:47
I can’t fault it. It’s what I have believed myself but haven’t really been able to explain as easily as you and in plain English. Have you a link to your YouTube channel? I shall subscribe straight away :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:56:26
Same here in the UK. This year or last few months even has been mental! People asking about it left right and centre and all wanting to buy in! An S curve adoption about to kick off? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:58:06
Hey Andreas! I want to thank you for your hard work and effort! You got me involved in Bitcoin and I learnt a lot from you. I even have a signed book by you in the house. Thanks for everything! 
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:26:16
Agreed! I feel that things are picking up in this sense. But yes it would be great if we had others who were well spoken and able to take something technical like Bitcoin and explain it to everyday people.
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:34:16
I just watched your documentary and thought it to be very interesting!
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:04:27
My Bitcoin, which art in cyberspace, hallowed be thy blockchain.  Thy network come, thy adoption be done, on Ebay as it is in Mt. Gox.  Give us this day our daily price bubble, and forgive us our cash transactions, as we forgive those who question thy inevitability, and lead us not into Litecoin, but deliver us from the goldbugs.  Amen.
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:16:09
Very true and the song was about money being evil in general, so not just bitcoin. I'm sure most of us here know the strengths of bitcoin over fiat currencies of the old monetary system.
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:26:39
I'm not saying that one reference in one song will make bitcoin mainstream over night. That obviously takes time. But if we see bitcoin mentioned more and more, it will gain more mind share with the general public. I do feel that the fact bitcoin was referenced is a powerful thing. It shows that more and more people are noticing it and it is slowly building up in terms of awareness. 
Perhaps what we need to do as a community is to explain in simple terms, what bitcoin is, what it can and will do, and why it is better than the current monetary system. Once we change the publics perception, we will see bigger mainstream adoption. But it is amazing how bitcoin is starting to be referred to more and more in the mainstream media. I feel that this is just the beginning!

Why thank you kind sir!
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:16:31
It’s funny how people can’t see this. Bitcoin and cryptos need time to grow and mature. It won’t be an immediate success over night :)
@_date: 2014-06-07 20:52:11
The connotations were pretty negative but its a moody song. I still think the mention of Bitcoin will do good. It feels as though there is a more and more public awareness building up.

I don't think anyone accepts Bitcoin there for payment but it has been awhile since I visited. Is Abacus based in the emporium?
@_date: 2015-08-28 11:58:47
Agreed, but even if they are optional it will give a better impression to the public and media which may make them more willing to adopt to Bitcoin with time. Right now people are put off by the negative image of Bitcoin. 
A quote from the article "With regulation Bitcoin services can be seen to have the same standard of professionalism as other financial institutions which will lead to a better public perception of Bitcoin. With a better image we may see the public migrate with open arms into the Bitcoin ecosystem and in turn see Bitcoin finally move into its mainstream stage."
Do you not agree that we have an image problem that some form of regulation will help us overcome even if it is optional? Its more about keeping the public happy to convince them to get on board with Bitcoin and not fight against it.
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:26:05
I will keep that in mind but it can get very lonely in the cold Welsh winter months. The sheep are often more alluring than the women here.
@_date: 2015-08-15 07:40:18
The last meetup was great, I look forward to meeting you all!
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:37:36
Do you not feel that could be viewed a little bit borderline extreme and that the migration to a Bitcoin economy would be more of a gradual migration than a rush to an alternative system?
@_date: 2015-08-27 18:13:11
Does everyone agree that we need some sort of oversight in place to prevent another Mark Karpeles? But what is the balance to a fair framework for this?
@_date: 2015-08-23 20:30:04
Thats brilliant!! I shall be checking this out and see if we can book events in there and meetups. I'm not from Cardiff myself so am unfamiliar with Abacus, but it is greatly appreciated for you pointing it out. Where abouts in Wales is it you live?
@_date: 2015-08-29 08:53:26
Please help us decide on whether we stick to the original B⃦ logo or adopt to the new Ƀ symbol. What is everyones opinion?
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:37:21
Hi, yes Wales in the UK. Where do you live? There is a good number of us Bitcoin supporters now :) We've all formed a group.  
@_date: 2015-08-08 15:18:25
Does everyone agree with the regulatory part of this article at the end?
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:10:28
Brilliant post!
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:45:56
Very true, but I have always thought that we would have to integrate with the old system in order for people to move over to our 'new' system of Bitcoin. For example, easily acquiring Bitcoin with a bank account or credit card. 
A seamless and simple transaction from the legacy system to the new. Perhaps for this to happen we would need some sort of regulations in order for this to happen? But yes I agree that in the long term we do not want to trust or rely on the legacy system for too much and won't have to in the long term future when we replace the legacy system.
And also for mainstream adoption to take place. Do you think that mainstream adoption will happen with or without support from the legacy system? and would this be possible without some sort of regulation?
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:40:03
Haha, yes Bitcoin feels like the wild west right now and certainly has room to grow. I never thought of the multi sig aspect of controlling Bitcoin funds. I guess a regulator might not even be necessary in that case! Great thought!
@_date: 2015-07-03 19:05:23

@_date: 2018-11-08 10:17:25
People value digital assets as much as physical assets in my opinion. You only need to look how much time people spend on social media and other online activities to realise that fact. And yes Bitcoin is a rare gold like asset for the digital age. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:59:45
Congrats on the release!
@_date: 2018-11-08 10:18:39
I like Gold but prefer Bitcoin. Personally I sold my gold and silver a few years back and moved over to Bitcoin. Safe to say I havent looked back.
@_date: 2018-11-08 10:13:44
It is always good to have some crypto as a hedge. If the markets crash we could see a rush into crypto. Personally I have some equities and also cryptos 
@_date: 2018-11-10 06:56:28
Same here tbh. But I guess I had already stuck in what I could afford and I did not want to risk more than I could afford.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:46:37
I have used them a handful of times for buying and have had no issues. I also like the fact they are UK based.

Thanks, you are correct. I have updated the article and thanks for the positive feedback!
@_date: 2015-09-05 06:24:22
I am always striving to find out the opinions and experiences from others about Bitcoin in order to gain insight from those who operate in the industry. Here is my short online interview with George Basiladze the co-founder of Cryptopay. What are your opinions?
@_date: 2015-09-05 06:26:20
Possibly, but is back up now :)
@_date: 2015-09-06 15:35:20
Thanks for the constructive criticism, I will remember that for next time. I wrote the article in a slight rush, but have noticed that sometimes I repeat myself.
@_date: 2015-09-03 20:20:38
Haha, yes I wanted to be as unbiased as possible to give a full round up of the situation and let the reader decide about how they feel about this. Although I did briefly voice my own opinion at the end but kept it to a minimum as not to appear too biased.
@_date: 2015-09-04 20:49:39

Text for those who do not wish to follow the link:-
The new Satoshi Point Bitcoin ATM has arrived at Swansea, South Wales and it was a great launch event for what is the first Bitcoin ATM in the Swansea area! It is located at Cafe Nisse which is run by the friendly Tino Dzaro who also has an interest in the latest technology. I was given a tour of TechHub which is located directly above and it was exciting to see an environment where tech entrepreneurs and startups can gather in Swansea and work and socialise. I was very impressed by the professionalism of the place and I am glad to see an environment that is helping to create opportunities in the Swansea area.
It was great to meet Hassan Khoshtaghaza (Managing Director of Satoshi Point) and his friend Robert Olsen. They both have a massive enthusiasm for Bitcoin and are really helping to push adoption and understanding in this technology. I feel that a Bitcoin ATM will help to push adoption in the local area and allow people to experiment with this young and exciting cryptocurrency. Overall it was an exciting day and the ATM could not be placed at a better location.
In terms of using the ATM itself, it was a breeze to use and only took a few clicks on screen whilst following the instructions to purchase or sell Bitcoin. It is a two-way machine where you can both purchase and sell. I tested both functions and am glad to report that they work well. You may very well see me running there to sell some Bitcoin when the price goes to the moon! Below are some photos I took of the event in what may be my new favourite coffee shop!
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:50:49

For those who do not wish to follow the link; what are your thoughts on alternative systems with a central party in control? :- 
IBM is creating a Bitcoin clone, but one that is controlled by a third party. This completely misses the point of Bitcoin and would simply serve to create a weaker imitation. I say this because Bitcoin is an open source technology and anyone can contribute and build upon the Bitcoin network. It is a free network that is open for innovation to take place. A closed network would simply serve those in control.
There are currently hundreds to thousands of people working on new Bitcoin services and code, that is only possible due to its open nature. A network or protocol controlled by a central authority would be less innovative due to it being a walled garden. During the early days of the internet, AOL tried to keep users on its own network and made it very hard to access external sites. This meant that users had a very limited reach to other websites and could only sample a small selection of what the internet had to offer.
This also happened with mobile phones in the early 2000’s where internet access was through the WAP protocol and you were forced to use the services of your mobile carrier. Services like these were superseded by the full blown internet as it had vastly more information and utility. As the internet was open to all, more companies and individuals were able to develop and create new content and services. This in turn made the open internet more valuable in comparison to services like AOL that had less content.
Some of these services also happened to cost more as customers had no choice or competition to chose from. The MMS protocol is a fine example of this. It was reasonably expensive to send a simple photo from your mobile phone to another when picture messaging was relatively new. Today you can send a picture message for nothing in a variety of different ways. History has always shown that you can not trust a central authority with control of a system or its content. It always leads corruption or control over the masses in one form or another.
Bitcoin will be the long term winner as it is completely self sufficient much like the internet today and vastly more empowering over the competition or legacy systems that it will replace. Any alternative that is controlled by a central authority feels like a Bitcoin 0.5 clone that is heavily gimped and destined to fail like other antiquated and closed systems of the past. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:03:44
I think it may be a good few years to many when we have hundreds of thousands programming for Bitcoin. It could very well happen one day though!

For those who dont want to follow the link:- 
As time marches on and technology progresses at an astonishing rate, we find ourselves with more freedom. Freedom to do the things that we want and more spare time on our hands to take part in the leisure pursuits that we enjoy. We live in the mechanisation of a modern world where its heart beats to the rhythm of jet planes that fly above and billions of cars that rev along all day. 
For those of us who live in a 1st world country, we have had these luxuries for many decades and they seem trivial to us now. But these machines have given us great opportunities to travel for leisure or work and achieve more in less time. They have allowed us to become more connected and make the world a much smaller place. In centuries gone, the masses would have not wandered past their local area but today we can travel physically to any location in a couple of days or less. Transport has allowed for many opportunities in the world of trade and commerce and made us richer and more able. Able to be free! 
It only seems logical then that the exchange of information would become modernised, which led to the Internet as we know it. Even faster than physical transport it has allowed us to share vast amounts of knowledge on a global scale. The instant exchange of information has allowed us to share our thoughts and ideas and create new worlds that exist digitally where the rules of the physical world do not apply. No longer is a printing press, TV crew, or radio station needed for means of sharing your thoughts or ideas with a global audience. Operating and communicating on a global scale is now remarkably cheap and easy.
It seems fitting that currencies should be the next in line to be modernised. In a world where we can physically travel anywhere in little amounts of time, or share information freely and cheaply. Why is it that we can not share wealth and value in such an easy fashion? As humans we value freedom and the chance it brings to create new businesses, help others, better ourselves. Humans are much like free flowing water. We travel and follow the path of least resistance until we hit a rock. This rock is then worn down little by little until we can flow again. 
Bitcoin is much like free flowing water. It travels with little resistance, unaware of the political and physical borders of the real world it travels across. An apolitical payments network that does not judge or discriminate. Many instinctively recoil at Bitcoin and are saying something like this;
What is this Bitcoin nonsense? How dare you tell me to use a currency that has no borders and will allow for a truly global exchange of value. A programable money that can be automated and will allow me to be my own bank and have more power and freedom is nonsense. Now leave me be so I can watch my government sanctioned TV that tells me there is only one currency and that is one that can only be used in a manner and region that my government sees fit.
Which seems more likely; that humans will stick to a local currency that can only be used in one small part of the world? or adopt to a global currency that is free to move much like we are? Not only is Bitcoin free to move around the world but it allows all to contribute and play fair. The incentive is far bigger to play by the rules than cheat. Compare this to todays monetary systems where the incentive is large enough for those who control the money supply to lie or steal and you can see why Bitcoin is the better system. 
A better system was born for the masses in centuries gone by that allowed for the flow and freedom of physical travel and has changed the way we live for the better. As we adopted to these freedoms of travel, we needed a superior system for the exchange of information. A better system called the ‘Internet’ was born and has allowed us to learn more and better ourselves beyond what our parents could have dreamed of just a few decades ago.
We now find ourselves in need of a better system for the transfer of value and wealth. That system could very well be Bitcoin. So too shall the exchange of value flow free like flowing water. Over a dumb network that does not judge. It shall bring the masses opportunities and freedoms that we can not imagine. The only losers are those at the top, the tough rock that thought it was impenetrable to the flowing water. It shall be smoothed down to size and made irrelevant by a free and open network that will bring fairness and transparency to all.
