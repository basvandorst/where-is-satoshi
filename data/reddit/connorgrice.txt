Lol now how do you expect to ever make any money saying shit like that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:28:41
Facts. Bitcoins value is based more on its status and by its backing with exchanges. If 50% of exchanges go down the bitcoin price will drop dramatically unlike a coin like ether which it’s value while hyped is based and closer to being representative of its value because of its technology

Damn massive fuckin rip

Also extremely inefficient and costly and an enormous hassle. The reason things like PayPal work is because of extremely low transfer fees and instant transfer and the huge adoption of it.

Yea ripple had a jolt of momentum. So? Ripples uptrend isn’t consistent and it only goes up in short jumps

No I truly do not believe bitcoin will ever be used for its original purpose as a fiat replacement in day to day purchases. I do believe if crypto does take over one day it will most likely be etherum that takes over as the standard coin for day to day use due to its superior technology. Bitcoin will always be an investment, Fking Digital Gold is what it is

Or commit suicide behind a gas station 2 years from now when they are in unthinkable amounts of debt because they gambled everything they have ever had on this one asset :) . Could go either way

Id recommend a hardware wallet even for a small amount because it future proofs your future crypto investments
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:21:38
Lol good advice 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:06:20
Ehh hard to tell. Personally I don’t know why you are trying to predict this shit. If you believe in the technology behind bitcoin then buy and hold. If not then buy in cheap and make a quick buck off this bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:44:04
This fuckr won’t be alive 3 more years the way he sounds 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:11:25
Would it’s name sound like hold or hawd ull 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:33:08
Honestly I don’t know how the market will react in that event but for now it seems that we have stabilized 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:14:55
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:22:22
Ripple lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:49:27
Tell me. Who would use a currency that’s price can change by 25% in a day and that has hour long transfers and enormous fees. Give me one logical fucking reason that bitcoin is a sensible option for a fiat replacement 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:03:42

@_date: 2017-08-10 12:42:04

@_date: 2017-08-08 00:00:47
Ive done much business via friends and family before and have yet to find a function to reverse it other than straight up calling paypal and reporting fraud
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:59:31
I didn't think I was gonna make quick money I wanted to just convert usd to btc
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:58:08

@_date: 2017-08-08 00:13:53
Shitty fucking sub just got scammed by some fucker who I bought an egb card for and then blocked me. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:47:57
Did you not read the part where it says "friends and family" it's a service on paypal that allows you to send without being able to reverse

@_date: 2017-11-30 19:21:19

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:08
Stop using inspect element lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:59

@_date: 2017-11-30 19:11:32
Yea but I want to buy 2 but coinbase js fuckery 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:35

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:44
Uuhh just hit under 9k
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:27
Honestly its just hard for me $5400 which is what I had planned to buy on 2x felt like the last chance anyone had at buying reasonable priced bitcoin and now it feels like shit to think about buying in at 10k
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:19:19
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:17:34
Ik man but 5 digits
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:47:39
Lol I was planning on buy either 1 or 2 on the 2x crash but coinbase acted up. Have alot of btsc stock like 6k worth
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:09:05
If we could predict the future then we would all be bill gates. tl:dr don't try and day trade this shit for small margins. Buy a couple BTC and hodl on until you are haply with your gains
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:08:47
Yea imma carry 10K cash on me to an atm
