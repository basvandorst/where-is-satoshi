If you tried selling me something in any currency other than USD I'd have to look up its value before making the transaction.
So for those using your points, it's essentially the lack of adoption that's formulating their opinions. While no one may use it as a unit of account, it is one. It's just one that is not advisable for the very reasons you point out.
I'll stick with considering it a currency, just not a viable one.

Economics is not my strong suit, so can you ELi5 how one designs a currency? 
As for currency, and the value it encompasses, why are some not considering BTC a currency? Does it have to do with it not being a widely adopted currency?
This is how I always understood what currency and money was.

No, my definition is something that has all of the logical attributes of currency/money and can be used to purchase goods. For me, its not practical because of the volatility and not enough merchants accepting it yet. However, many merchants accept bitcoin and it seems to be gaining traction. Even then, there is no minimum number of merchants requirement to be considered a currency. One example is Overstock. They accept bitcoin and state on their site that it is a "digital currency".  Just because McDonalds does not accept it doesn't mean it's not a currency.
