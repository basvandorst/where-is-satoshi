No, I consider TV to be the most shady of all sources. What surprised me was the lack of delicacy but even more the "pumping up" (There's definitely a term that doesn't come to my mind. Think of being dry-humped for minutes and then expected to hand over your credit card.)

Thank you for that small mental morning orgasm.
That book is so close to the bone in terms of scope and just makes it fiction by fiddling with the scale.

If I were stoned I'd be staring even longer at your sentence than I already have. It sounds like something from n-dimensional philosophy chess with formalized rules.

Thanks for the explanation although it was unnecessary. I was referring to the state of our culture because you have to be pretty civilized to even consider a 'light switch cover'. It boggles my mind at least that we have come to decorate even the most mundane objects.

That sounds like something I would expect from a strip club or brothel. I didn't expect that the news media had made such advances in the field of prostitution.

Just FYI but by including a map you have made your client instantly identifiable. I don't think it really matters as lawyers are very public facing businesses but I just wanted to let you know.

1. Become Beefcake

That makes sense while at the same time hinting at the state of decadence of our culture.

I was actually not being ironic in spite of the term beefcake. This kind of monetization is far more sensible are easier to implement than e.g. ads.

Read them back to back. Enjoyed the ride every second. It's the pinnacle of the techno thriller and definitely in the god-tier of scifi. At least to me.
Kill Decision is also great and while still totally believable it's just not the same without a revolution :)

Yeah, but as we see in the case of HSBC you just pay a small fine compared to the crime.

Morally, yes. But I'm really not sure (as with most things bitcoin) how this would play out legally.

Doesn't Argentina and especially Buenos Aires have a massive problem with counterfeit cash?
In that case adopting a currency that's basically impossible to counterfeit is a smart choice *g*

Currency is intangible as say a meter. You can have a bill or a ruler that shows you "This is how the concept is represented in our reality."
Currency is a unit of measurement and thus not able of representing anything. But maybe we're getting lost in semantics here.

Which it already did... twice. You really think most people here are looking at btc as a boiler room tactic?

This even has the advantage that you can view the balance on your paperwallet without anyone being able to manipulate it even if they got into your account.
As for USD -&gt; BTC: too many to mention and not my field of expertise.

"a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."
Yet let us not delude ourselves: in economics there is no truth. You can only hope to have something that works at best.

I don't see DPR giving an interview about btc. He is talking about SR and for something a brazen like that to work btc is a necessary technology (anonymizing software being the other mandatory).
I see that it might not be the best PR for btc but this isn't the first article Forbes has run on the topic of btc as opposed to DPR who was never really keen on mainstream attention as such and thus it'll be a long time IMO before he'll resurface in this fashion.
As beneficial as bitcoin is likely to be for society in general as detrimental is the behemoth we call the War on Drugs on so many levels. Everybody chooses his own fights.

I know far to little as to what the Chinese government thinks on monetary policy but there might be some truth to your thought:
"Eventually Q Coin trading volume hit several billions of yuan per year, rising at 15-20% annually. China’s central bank worried that Q Coins could be used to launder money and to inflate asset bubbles. The government eventually cracked down, banning, among other things, the exchange of “virtual currency” between user accounts."
