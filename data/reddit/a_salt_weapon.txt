Except bitcoin is way more than just the technology/software/algorithm. It's a system of currency that transcends the technology used to implement it. He's right that Bitcoin itself is not hacked but he makes the same mistake in his tweet. Simply saying "Bitcoin is unaffected" is as wildly inaccurate as "Bitcoin is hacked". Using that phrase is the equivalent of saying there's nothing wrong with the US dollar while Wall Street burns to the ground. If you think your cash is unaffected when a major financial market goes up in flames, you're being extremely short sighted. The dollar absolutely would be affected were a major trading center suddenly become unavailable. Is it an excuse to replace all your dollars with euros? Probably not since but that depends on who you are.

Sure but at this point we have to consider it as a whole system. It's not just technology.

This is part of the reason I'm skeptic bitcoin will see widespread adoption outside of the most technically capable. It's hard enough as someone highly technical to keep up with changes and make sure your coin doesn't get swiped. I don't know what soccer moms and grandmas are going to do.

I don't have one but I'm going to guess that the card either doesn't transact with Bitcoin when you make a purchase but instead withdraws Bitcoin at periodic intervals to cover the USD cost of your purchases for that period. Confirm/deny?

If you're in the US I hope you save your receipts.

What if you were using Bitcoin for your day to day transactions? You know, like a currency is usually used. Would you still think the same if you went to Subway and bought a $5 sandwich with Bitcoin and had to pay an enormous fee on top of that? Then you filled up your gas tank and had to pay an enormous fee on top of that too? If the end game is for Bitcoin to be a currency, and that's the only way it's going to hold value long term, fees can't be exorbitant because of the frequency a person transfers money.

You can put it in but you can't get it out. To transfer BTC to an address outside of Gox you need to be verified with ID and I get the impression they're not processing verifications timely.

Mainstream, at least to me, will be when the price of bitcoin is irrelevant to the bulk of it's user base. Bitcoin is meant to be currency not a retirement plan. That means when you're comfortable trading away some amount of bitcoin for a Big Mac, Bitcoin will be mainstream and at that point "how high will this go?"' won't be something you care about.

LOL. I did the same thing but this isn't the end of bitcoin. You won't lose the money until you sell. If you don't sell, there's an extremely good chance it bounces back by tomorrow morning.

I probably don't have any optimistic words for you if you're looking for quick turn around on your money but if we look at the philosophy behind bitcoin, that is a currency away from banks and centralized regulation, the best thing to do is leave your money in bit coin for the long haul. Get it into a wallet only you control and away from an exchange. Make sure you keep your wallet info safe and accessible. The reason I say this is bitcoin hasn't reached ubiquity yet. It's acceptance is still growing and as it grows so does it's worth. Once it's sufficiently usable by the everyman, that's when it's true worth will surface and your investment will pay off.

I would assume that money earned from a Bitcoin sale would be considered a sale of property in the U.S. If you work with your lender and explain it's a sale of digital property you own they should be able to set you up with what you need.

You never want to split your community for something like this. Imagine if some country came out and said we're duplicating our currency and we'll now use two different kinds. Everyone that has money saved will receive an equal amount of the new currency. Now you've got some of each. Now you go out into the world and some people accept one or the other and some people accept both. Can you imagine the kind of hassle that is? It also reduces the value on both since it's not desired by the whole community. You might eventually get to the point where one of them is completely worthless and those who adopted that currency en force are left holding the bag.
For crypto currency to be a mainstream thing, mass adoption needs to happen. When you have as many different kinds of digital coin as there is, mass adoption is hindered. The whole "I wanna do this my way." attitude of all the digital currencies and even the bitcoin powers that be isn't helping anyone and makes it hard to take anyone seriously.
TL;DR - I don't want to buy either if there's not stability and this whimsical changing of bitcoin is not stability.
