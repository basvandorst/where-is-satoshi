the first thing that got me interested in DASH which was called Darkcoin at the time was the anonymous transaction feature. then when i learned about the 2nd tier masternode rewards i sold all my btc and all my others alts (mostly ltc) and went all in. i could keep my money in btc and have it sit there doing nothing or i could have it paying me a 20-25% roi at the time.  as more people buy masternodes (1000 DASH) and set them up the higher the price will go to offset the reward % decrease.

i've been very happy with circle and avoid coinbase because of all the spying/tracking and closed accounts due to using btc in ways they don't like. all my btc are bought and then go immediately to an alt exchange like polo to buy DASH and set up masternodes for a ~15% roi.

from my research drk is just as evenly distributed as btc. people have always complained about btc's unfair distribution but like drk i think the sale of cheap coins in the early days worked itself out for the most part. if you have a problem with drk distribution and not btc/ltc then you are a hypocrite. 
the fear is one or two plus people (satoshi/early miners/fbi) hold too many coins and will dump. if the drk rich list was gonna dump they already would have during the last big dump or the previous ones when the coin was pennies. 100,000's of drk were sold in the last several months for almost nothing because it did not look like drk would take off until just recently.
cryptonote has bloat issues and dark is implementing something just as good/better with out the bloat. the coins that have the cn tech all have problems too and have been dismissed by btc people in the know. dismissed because of things like a 80% premine on one coin which caused someone else to clone it but without a real dev to do updates and make a simple wallet. 
darksend is closed source for now (next few months) but it's a separate download from the open source drk wallet so you don't have to use it if you are scared. i trust the dev.
as has already been said darksend is a trustless decentralized mixer that adds denominated pooling on top of the coinjoin tech. bottom line is it's way better than cj and will be even better in a few months with rc4.

correct, i believe.
however, some people who live off long term cap gains may not have to report those gains unless they total over 36k per individual per year or 72k for a joint filling. 
"For lower-income individuals, the rate may be 0% on some or all of the net capital gain." 
 
from what i understand if you make less than around $9500 a year from income (lower-income individuals) you don't have to file taxes and your cap gains are taxed at 0% until you hit around 36k per individual or around 72k for a joint filing. i'm not sure if you have to report them but what i was told is you don't have to pay taxes on them unless you go over 36k/72k. so you would pay 15% on all lt cap gains over 36k/72k and i guess also report everything. the trick seems to be spending under 36k/72k in gains per year.

Did anyone actually read the IRS's statement? Any purchase or transaction under $600 does not have to be reported.
plus, it only applies to fixed and determinable income.
example, it can apply to rent but not grocery stores or gas stations or most things that are everyday use non fixed and non determinable income. your cable bill may apply but not electric. so for rent i guess you would need to include a copy of your monthly rent check or statement. same with other easy fixed payments like a cable bill. most fixed payments like rent can't be paid with btc yet anyway. sounds pretty easy though and makes sense why they would only apply it to easily reportable fixed monthly type payment items and not everyday things.
 or another interpretation.....
If you convert your bitcoins to fiat currency and then make everyday purchases using dollars, it will be relatively easy to report the short or long-term capital gains that single transaction.
But if you use the bitcoins in your wallet to purchase goods directly, then theoretically, the IRS should be informed of the capital gains incurred on the bitcoin at the time of the purchase, pointed out various tax attorneys that CoinDesk quizzed yesterday.
In practice, though, it seems unlikely that anyone would do this. Greg Broiles, an attorney specializing in estate planning, trust and probate, who spoke on bitcoin and taxation at Bitcoin 2013, argues that accountants have a concept called “materiality“. This essentially argues that transactions should only be included for accounting purposes when they’re significant enough. An $8 sandwich paid for in bit coins probably doesn’t count. A $30,000 Harley probably would, though.
the irs regulations are still being worked out and will change after the public comments period and official regulations.

btc most likely won't change and it should not. the gov and regs won and btc will submit to them. it's unfortunate for old school true believes but it will be good for the price and help crypto in general. btc is taking one for the team and has been all but captured by tptb or will be in the future due to centralized mining which is easily regulated (think coinvalidation).

Did anyone actually read the IRS's statement? Any purchase or transaction under $600 does not have to be reported.
plus, it only applies to fixed and determinable income.
example, it can apply to rent but not grocery stores or gas stations or most things that are everyday use non fixed and non determinable income. your cable bill may apply but not electric. so for rent i guess you would need to include a copy of your monthly rent check or statement. same with other easy fixed payments like a cable bill. most fixed payments like rent can't be paid with btc yet anyway. sounds pretty easy though and makes sense why they would only apply it to easily reportable fixed monthly type payment items and not everyday things.
 or another interpretation.....
If you convert your bitcoins to fiat currency and then make everyday purchases using dollars, it will be relatively easy to report the short or long-term capital gains that single transaction.
But if you use the bitcoins in your wallet to purchase goods directly, then theoretically, the IRS should be informed of the capital gains incurred on the bitcoin at the time of the purchase, pointed out various tax attorneys that CoinDesk quizzed yesterday.
In practice, though, it seems unlikely that anyone would do this. Greg Broiles, an attorney specializing in estate planning, trust and probate, who spoke on bitcoin and taxation at Bitcoin 2013, argues that accountants have a concept called “materiality“. This essentially argues that transactions should only be included for accounting purposes when they’re significant enough. An $8 sandwich paid for in bit coins probably doesn’t count. A $30,000 Harley probably would, though.
the irs regulations are still being worked out and will change after the public comments period and official regulations.

the 30k were from the silk road wallet. maybe it was unlocked when they grabbed it and cracked his pin. i heard they had access to the server and may have hacked it that way.
the real question is how they got the 100k btc. no way it was not password protected. until i hear otherwise i bet the broke the encryption on the wallet. maybe they found his paper wallet though, only dpr knows and he ain't talking.
before anyone says they can't crack the btc wallet encryption with a 13 character password then maybe you can tell us how they got the 100k?
 in the nyc hearings the feds said the encryption was not a problem. i take that to mean they can crack it.

i'm not so sure about that. looks like it can apply to rent but not grocery stores or gas stations or most things that are everyday use non fixed and non determinable income. your cable bill may apply but not electric.
so for rent i guess you would need to include a copy of your rent check or statement. same with other easy fixed payments like a cable bill. most fixed payments like rent can't be paid with btc yet anyway. sounds pretty easy though and makes sense why they would only apply it to easily reportable fixed monthly type payment items and not everyday things.
also, if you make less than around $9500 a year in income you don't have to file taxes. and individuals who live off investments don't have to report cap gains until they reach around 36k per individual and around 72k per couple joint filling.
so if you can live off 36k/72k a year from investments (not income) then you should not have to report anything. that's my interpretation but you should consult a professional accountant which i'm not.
Q-12: Is a payment made using virtua
l currency subject to
information reporting?
A payment made using virtual currency is
subject to information reporting to the
same extent as any other payment made in
property. For example, a person who in the
course of a trade or business makes a paym
ent of fixed and determinable income using
virtual currency with a value of $600 or more to
a U.S. non-exempt recipient in a taxable
year is required to report the payment to
the IRS and to the payee. Examples of
payments of fixed and determinable income
include rent, salaries, wages, premiums,
annuities, and compensation

so i guess you concede my other points about fixed and determinable income and retract your other statements?
i never said all gains under $9500 are exempt i said if you make less than $9500 a year in "income" (not cap gains) you are not required to file taxes every year.
from my other post....
"For lower-income individuals, the rate may be 0% on some or all of the net capital gain."
 from what i understand if you make less than around $9500 a year from income (lower-income individuals) you don't have to file taxes and your cap gains are taxed at 0% until you hit 36k per individual or around 72k for a joint filing. i'm not sure if you have to report them but what i was told is you don't have to pay unless you go over 36k/72k.

btc can solve all of those problems but not  without centralized 3rd party services with noncompetitive fee's.
there are not any trustless and decentralized solutions to most of those problems, not without a lot of pain and hardforks. and without proper governance... forget about it!
btc makes a good global settlement system but is not designed to do trust-less decentralized anonymous instant transactions.

Evan says he has something better than ring signatures.  Ring signatures are good for anonymity but they bloat up the block chain (up to 8x of bitcoin) and that will be a major barrier to any kind of large scale adoption.
If Evan's solution is 95% as anonymous and saves us from the bloat then we would be the clear choice over the cryptonote clones from a technical perspective.  His solution is planned for RC4 (July). Good things come to those that wait...
I am using cryptonote coins to get acquainted with them... too many problems... ram use, bloated blockchain, problematic transactions due to size limit, all-around-scaling issues in terms of cpu/ram/disk requirement, problematic adoption from exchanges/merchants etc... the only thing that seems fixable is the gui. All the rest need heavy modification or redesign to even be usable. And that's on a technical level, because on an economic level the inflation of cryptonote coins is killing the investors and those who hedged DRK with them.
I think both drk and cryptonote coins have the same opponent: a cryptonote v2 coin that solves the first generation issues and retains or even improves the anonymity capabilities. And even then it will have the question of "is it robust and safe?" - because it's a new blockchain that hasn't been time-tested as well as bitcoin has.
i think i'll wait for cn v2.

IMO bitcoin should accept this will happen and get over it. if you want fungibility and decentralized instant transactions there are other choices out there. 
Bitcoin is not an anon coin and should not try and be one. bitcoin should accept centralization and lack of fungibility and embrace it, there is a lot of money to be made in that lane.

Rand Paul 2016!!!
Rand Paul's pro-liberty record:
 Vs. Obama/Hillary
Filibustered CIA nominee John Brennan over Obama’s secret drone killing policy of American’s on US soil
Filibustered the Patriot Act Re-authorization
Introduced a bill that would end warrant-less domestic drone surveillance
Opposes the NDAA (Sections 1021 &amp; 1022 added by Obama that allows for Indefinite Detention of American Citizens at gitmo without trial)
TYT: Obama Insisted on Indefinite Detentions of American Citizens
Supports Military tribunals at Guantanamo bay (Gitmo) in opposition to Obama’s indefinite detention executive order.
("The thing is that justice should be a trial and to do something with the people who should be responsible for this. So indefinite detention, I don't think, is a good idea, Let's go ahead and have trials and justice." Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.)
Blocked a bill from being interpreted as authorizing war on Iran or Syria
Opposes SOPA/PIPA and CISPA (Internet Censorship Regulations)
Opposes the TSA Gropers
Stopped an increase in mandatory minimum punishments for non-violent drug offenses
Opposes The (Private) Federal Reserve Wall Street Bankster Cartel
Opposes using the IRS to target political enemies
Blocked Democrat gas and oil lobbyist legislation that exempted testing of older pipelines
“Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who had been holding up the measure, agreed
Monday to let it move forward after reaching agreement with Democratic
Senators to add a key recommendation made by the National Transportation
Safety Board after the San Bruno blast, which killed eight people and
destroyed 38 homes.
Paul added a requirement for testing older pipelines. The measure was approved by unanimous consent Monday evening.
Usually wary of regulatory oversight, Paul surprised Congress watchers by saying he wanted to strengthen the legislation.” The Los Angeles Times

“We ought to just end the war on drugs and make it a much more local situation, community oriented.” - Rand Paul 
Introduced S. 2644, the FAIR (Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration) Act, which would protect the rights of citizens and restore the Fifth Amendment's role in seizing property without due process of law. 
Filed an amendment (3630) in the Senate that would protect states that implement medical marijuana laws, as well as patients and physicians in those states, from federal prosecution. 
Amendment 3630 allows states to "enact and implement laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of marijuana for medical use" without fear of federal prosecution. There are 33+ states that have enacted laws protecting some form of medical marijuana.
Amendment 3630 also prohibits prosecution of patients and physicians in those states for violating federal laws against the drug.

@_date: 2015-03-21 03:37:43
The decentralized marketplace will be the downfall of sdc, it's a stupid idea just asking for trouble. They need to stick with improving their anon and fixing the ring sig bloating issues. Not much can be done to fix the poor initial distribution or pos algo. Maybe they can fork to a better algo like DPOS. 
If they did all that  i would diversify my anon crypto holdings from 100% Darkcoin/DASH to 90% DRK/DASH 10% SDC. Maybe more but the initial distribution worries me as i don't feel it has been worked through or even can be with the pos system. It's gonna take time with it's distribution model.
The early miners only let it get so high and then dump, rinse and repeat. It will stay cheap for a long while if that continues. 
They also need to stop trolling the Darkcoin/DASH ANN thread or everyone will hate them like they do monero who can't even put together an official gui wallet.

DASH - Digital Cash
Official Statement On Rebranding To Dash
Darkcoin’s vision has always been to create a trust-less, decentralized , private and fast payment platform for the benefit of the majority. This is our ethos and our most important goal, recently it became apparent that our branding was getting in the way of reaching the people we were trying to help, that is when I knew that in order to accomplish our vision we would need to change our name. Our ideals remain intact and we will continue to pursue them under any branding we have, now and in the future.
Months ago the community organically came up with the name “Dash” as a possible rebranding idea of Darkcoin, I took notice of this and the good deal of support it had in the forums. This lead to us researching the Dash brand for a few months...
@_date: 2015-10-09 06:17:26

monero has bloating problems and all kinds of other problems that you can look into if you want but here is a copy of a post i just made summing it all up...
"no coin is NSA proof, let me say that again, no coin is NSA proof. That being said it's probably not a good idea to hitch your wagon to a coin that is a one trick bloated pony that only does anon and will eventually be replaced by zerocash or something else that does it better. You want a coin that can do things like instant transactions and NSA resistant anon transactions and a whole lot more.
In the near future i see Darkcoin/DASH and the 2-tier masternode architecture as being able to do almost everything maidsafe, bitshares, ripple etc can do but on steroids."
Also, Zerocash is a monero killer.

well technically masternodes could be added to bitcoin but it would require a hardfork. luckily darkcoin also invented the spork but btc still won't do it anytime soon. 
btc should focus on what it's doing and not try and copy darkcoin. that way btc can more easily navigate the regulations that are coming without scaring the regulators too bad. 
andreas said something brilliant about apple pay opening up the masses to mobile payments/banking which he thinks will lead them to adopt bitcoin. 
so in that same vein i think their next step will be to adopt darkcoin, if they value privacy and want instant transactions.

Instantsend is great and i use it all the time, it is super cheap too,  the fee was high for a little while because the price of Dash went up so high, lol, good problem to have, sorry you missed out. the fee was reduced but the price of Dash just keeps going up so they will need to update it again later this year to be a few cents again, right now it is 20 cents. you really should keep your Dash FUD script up to date, it hurts your trolling efforts and people dismiss you as a hater with half facts and half FUD.

I'm not paid to say anything. I can say what i want about Dash as I have for years. If anything i'm here like others are here just seeing after and protecting my investment. So in that sense everyone is "getting paid" or at least trying to make money pushing their different coin/investment.
The only other people who are here are the haters and trolls who lost money on Dash by getting out too early and are butthurt, trying to justify why they made the right decision. It's usually a mix of attacking the tech but also claiming to have gotten out for moral or ethical reasons, which is the most hilarious excuse. But if you missed out on the opportunity of a lifetime i guess you need to come up with some pretty good excuses to tell yourself why you failed.

yeah maybe i'm just not sure how you would incentivize them and monetize the whole thing. 
if it was easy it would have already been done because what bitcoiner doesn't want 4 second anonymous instanTx transactions like Darkcoin/DASH.
i love what OT open transactions is doing which looks similar to masternodes but i don't know how they monetize it. 
either way bitcoin needs healthy competition and it's got it.

if that is even true it would be that cryptonote (monero) is 99% more anon than btc and DASH is 98% more anon than btc. neither have ever been traced.
do to the bloating caused by the ring sigs cryptonote (NSA) coins can't scale and are one trick ponies.
even the monero devs admit their tech (bytecoin clone) will be made obsolete by zerocash...
DASH has a lot more going for it besides anonymity which has never be cracked/tracked and has been reviewed by kristov atlas.
add instant (1-4sec) confirmed double spend proof transaction and decentralized governance by blockchain along with 100's or more transactions per sec scalability (in testing) and you have a winner.

you seem to think one person (evan) mined millions of dash the first 24hrs. we know that is not true. there were ~2 million mined in the first 24-48hr but there were 100's if not 1000's of miners connected and mining.
we know satoshi mined at least a million coins and hal did too. and that's just those two guys that have millions of btc each.
therefore dash distribution is provable better than early btc distribution.
if evan had millions of coins/1000+ masternodes his own marketing proposal would not have gotten voted out, but it did. he does not control the network or the votes. 
i believe evan said he has ~250 masternodes or 250k dash. he's not even the largest holder. the largest dash holder bought his dash on the exchanges.

[u][b]Dash De-anonymization Contest[/b][/u]
Icebreaker and other trolleros: [i]I have donated $1 to Monero's development team. [/i]I sent 0.25 Dash (TX ID: 59d51690d4b56ddbf1e393fa8d3a49bcfc3247f270f36be3b6ee411802666cba-000) to shapeshift.io, which converted it to Bitcoin and sent it to the official Monero donation address listed at 
I challenge you to de-anonymize this transaction. To make it just a little easier, I only used four rounds of Darksend, so it's exponentially less private than it would be with the maximum eight rounds.
Please tell me what address this transaction originated from.
@_date: 2017-07-08 22:37:14
instamine is a dead horse as all crypto coins have launch and/or distribution issues. Dash has better distribution than ltc now charts wise and better than btc at this early age/stage.
roadmaps are never late in crypto, lol. Dash has done a better job than most delivering on time and delivering solid useful features like instantsend, privatesend, governance, masternode payments etc. ask the jaxx's devs and eric vorhees/shapeshift how solid Dash is compared to all the other coins they work with.
there have been a few scammers that got money from the governance system but you can't prevent that and stay decentralized too. even centralized organizations get scammed. well over 90% have been great projects. legal contracts and escrow are now being implemented for larger project submitted by new or unknown people.
The Dash evolution release will be the first easy to use crypto. should be in test net later this year and ready starting Q1 next year.
@_date: 2016-07-08 04:02:19
“Maybe I don't understand the point of a masternode and why Dash chooses to give its reward to them. “
the point of a masternode is to require a hefty collaterally on full nodes so as to prevent sybil attacks. The rewards are for the masternodes “protocol level” mixing service and instant transactions. With btc and others you need to use a centralized 3rd party service like lighting network and pay a bunch of extra fees. Unfortunately LN could also censor transactions and cause other issue that they have not figured out how to fix yet and LN is still vaporware btw. 
The DASH evolution release will have free anonymous instant transactions for everyday users with the masternodes covering the cost from the rewards they get. Let me repeat that...free anonymous instant transactions!!!
“Except it's not collateral and it doesn't protect.”
yes it is and yes it does, that's the whole point. The high collateral on full nodes prevents Sybil attacks! 
Sorry but this is the last time I can repeat that, it's not up for debate, it is what it is.
“Except you still own the Dash, which you can later sell. It's like buying a house, then selling it down the road.”
lol, It's like buying a house and destroying/attacking it and then trying to sell it for millions less than what you paid. If you buy millions of dollars worth of masternodes which you would need to do to sybil attack dash (btc is much much much cheaper to sybil) and you are successful in a significant way then your millions of dollars in dash will be worthless as the price crashes from the attack. Sybil attacks are not a big problem for dash like btc and other coins. 
51% attacks are possible (right now) but very difficult and expensive if not impossible, that's why nobody has done it. We have working solutions to mitigate a 51% attack and are developing a collateralized (there's that word again) solution to pretty much totally prevent it or make it cost many many millions to pull off.
“So how do they lose their collateral from misbehaving?”
if you successfully attack the network in a meaningful way the price will drop, just like btc or say hmmm....THE DAO! Remember it takes millions to sybil dash so you would lose millions. It is cheaper to attack other crypto's like btc etc etc etc.
also if they misbehave and don't do their job they get banned from the network and don't get paid their rewards, automagically.
“I don't suggest owning it (nor does the creator of it, IIRC). Bleeding edge crypto is something that's actually interesting. “
fluffyponzi is not the creator of monero. The Creator/copier of monero is a known scammer who was kicked off the bitmonero project early on and then it was supposedly taken over by the community, who could just be the original (copy cat) anonymous scam dev with a new btctalk nickname like smooth or fluffyponyboy etc.

i would have to go back and listen again if i can stomach it. they were quit rude and talking over her, making noises and not letting her explain herself or what she was trying to say.
the bottom line is cryptocurrency is susceptible to sybil attacks. with dash and collateralized masternodes it is less so than bitcoin in many cases. or at least cost a hell of a lot more which is the whole point.
the interview pissed me off and i need to go back and listen to it again because i don't even know what they were talking about with their specific sybil attack case? do you?
i invited them to the non self moderated/uncensored btctalk dash thread to explain themselves but ...crickets.
they also claimed they were banned from the dashtalk forum but nobody seems to remember them even being there. they also claimed dash/x-11 asics did not exist. it was a hit job from the beginning to the end.

yes a sybil attack is a certain kind of attack. there are many different ways to sybil attack bitcoin is what i was trying to say. 
here's what i wrote on btctalk...
amanda was right about there being many different kinds of sybil attacks not just one as those crypto shock jocks purposely (or ignorantly) misunderstood what she was saying. 
"Three Bitcoin Core developers, Wladimir van der Laan, Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell, say Chainalysis' actions amount to a so-called Sybil attack on the bitcoin network, something CEO Grønager denies.
The attack, named after dissociative identity disorder sufferer Shirley Ardell Mason, occurs when an individual creates multiple fake identities to gain influence in a peer-to-peer network."

the point is distribution. 100's if not thousands mined dash the first 24hrs which is probably more than mined btc the whole first year or so. it's impossible to tell though in either case.
the monero cripplemine combined with the monero fastmine effected distribution way more than the DASH instamine or the bitcoin satoshi/hal mined.
the largest dash holder (otoh) did not mine/instamine anything but rather bought his dash on the market as you could have done.
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:40:17
you are right, a 51% attack is not a sybil attack it's a 51% mining attack. i worded it wrong trying to say that there is more than one kind of sybil attack.

“Compared to dash every sybil attack I can think of would cost more against dash than bitcoin. I'm definitely no expert though so what specific sybil attack are you talking about?
I don't think you understand what a sybil attack is.”
sure I do, I don't think you understand what a sybil attack is and that's why you can't answer my question. “what specific sybil attack are you talking about?”
from the rebuttal i linked to that you obviously did not read....
"15:40 – “How do they prevent sybil attacks?”
Amanda answered that question very well. The 1,000 Dash collateral per Masternode makes it financially impossible to establish enough nodes to effectively sybil attack the network. Since the interview team doesn’t go further into detail (there are several sybil-attack-scenarios with different goals), we are not inclined to guess what they meant exactly. Suffice it to say, any one entity (most likely a government) attempting to acquire enough Dash for such an enterprise will send the price of Dash beyond reasonable levels. Even then all the entity could do, would be destroying its own wealth through malicious behaviour."
“No, because it's not collateral. It's just a wealth requirement. There is nothing at stake. Collateral is only collateral if you lose it for misbehaving. “
you either don't understand how masternodes work or you don't understand how a sybil attack works. To buy enough masternodes to misbehave/preform a sybil attack it is going to cost you lots of money (millions). If your sybil attack is successful and really damaging then the value of dash goes down along with the millions in collateral (masternodes) you had to spend to sybil attack. That's the beauty of collateralized masternodes/full nodes. We call them collateralized nodes or masternodes in our presentations, you are the first person I have ever heard say they are not collateralized, because clearly they are and that's how we prevent sybil attack. I think you are in over your head at this point and it's time to cut your losses and move on.
“I don't think you know what a subil attack or collateral means. You are comparing deanonymization with outright theft. Not all attacks are equal.”
I don't think you know what a “sybil” attack or collateral means. I posted one example of a sybil attack, there are many others.
“They've been pretty positive on actual innovation (e.g. not sacms), like Monero and Counterparty.”
monero is a cripplemined, fastmined scam. monero did not invent anything they just copied a known scam coin (bytecoin) and have been fixing bugs for the last two years, no notable innovation what so ever. Hell they can't even invent a working official gui wallet, lol.

“What can a sybil attack against Bitcoin do, and what is the cost to execute it? Now compare to Dash. “
compared to dash every sybil attack I can think of would cost more against dash than bitcoin. I'm definitely no expert though so what specific sybil attack are you talking about?
“ That's not what collateral means. “
yes it is. Maybe you misunderstood or something. Dash has collateralized masternodes which make it very very expensive to sybil compared to btc and others.
“Which means the cost is easier to pull off. “
lol no, it means it is much much much more expensive to pull off. You're totally not getting something.
“Yes, because you don't know what a sybil attack is. Dash, if I understand correctly, rewards "masternodes". However, there's no way to know if there is one masternode or thousands, as one large holder could just split his Dash to represent different masternodes. This means that all it takes is that one node to, without cost, influence the network. There is no penalty for doing anything wrong, so the masternode that proves ownership of Dash has nothing at stake. “
I know what a sybil attack is but you don't seem to know or understand how the masternode system works. 
yes one person can run as many masternodes (similar to a btc full node) as he can afford. Right now a masternode (1000 dash) cost ~$7000. so no, “one node” can not “influence the network” but one owner with millions of dollars worth of masternodes can attack and in doing so lose (the value/crash the price) millions of dollars of collateral he had to put up to buy the masternodes. In btc there is no collateral (except server cost etc) and one person can set up many full nodes for very cheap (compared to dash) and sybil attack the network in many ways, One being Chainalysis. 
“Chances are they didn't use names you recognized. “
maybe but no one seems to remember seeing anyone make those arguments. I have invited them to ask questions on the btctalk dash thread which is not self moderated and totally uncensored. However they have not been seen, maybe because all the questions they asked in the interview have now been responded to and debunked.
“Duh, these guys root out scams. “
sounds like they are btc monopoly maxamlist and run scams on the public to protect their investment but idk. this is only the second or third time I have heard of them. The first was when they crashed the private btc meeting and were kicked out by the biggest players in btc. Seems like I also saw something about them quieting their podcast a few weeks ago but I only read the headline and did not click through.
Everything they said has now been debunked....

"So in masternodes - how does a masternode lose it's collateral? What can it do to cause collateral to be lost?"
to buy enough masternodes to sybil the dash network it would cost multi millions of dollars. if your attack is successful and significant then the price of dash would crash like eth/dao/etc did when attacked, probably way more depending on the attack. thereby losing you millions of dollars you had to put up as "collateral" to run those masternodes. i can't be any more clear than that. 
"What does a masternode? Are there non-master nodes, and do they do anything?"
we have regular client/wallet based nodes just like btc and other crypto's. the regular nodes (btc 38205)(ltc 5412)(dash 6065) are different from bitcoin/ltc full nodes (btc ~5794) (ltc ~833) and dash masternodes (~3955) which perform similar functions as btc/ltc full nodes but also way different functions like mixing and instant transactions. 
i don't know exactly how it all works under the hood but just that it does what the open source code says it is supposed to do. if you want a more technical answer you should post something at the dash forum in the technical thread. i'm not a programer/coder just an crypto enthusiast. someone smarter than me could probably explain it all better. peace
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:44:54
nay, you actually don't understand and i'm not buying your conspiracy theory. 
when masternode voting was first starting out you could see people voting with large numbers of masternodes in block votes. you could see when evan or otoh (largest dash holder) and other large holders voted. now there are scripts for everyone that does not cast all your votes at the same time but randomly places votes at different times so people can't do  timing analysis.
not sure exactly what you are claiming is not decentralized anyway. there's almost 4000 masternodes and even in your wildest conspiracy theories one person could only own ~ half of them from the instamine and rewards.  but millions of dash were traded on exchanges and millions hacked and sold from 3 different exchanges so your conspiracy theory fails again. even if they did anyone can have regular nodes just like btc. so i guess your only plausible (not really) conspiracy theory is someone is/has bought up 2 or 4 million coins and is going to sybil attack dash which would make their multi multi million dollar investment worthless? that makes no sense whatsoever.
that's the difference between btc nodes not being collateralized where anyone could start nodes and do a sybil attack for very cheap and walk away. it would cost mulit multi millions to do that with dash.

no matter what you do it is going to cost you part of your collateral, way way way more so than any other crypto (btc/ltc/monero/etc), it's simply a better way of doing full nodes and preventing sybil attacks. 
also, it makes more sense for said attacker to not attack and instead just use those multi millions of dollars in dash to set up masternodes and profit from the rewards, they would make more doing that in any case i can think of. double-spending will soon be a thing of the past with the dash evolution release where all trans will be instant and anon and free for regular users. double spending is already 100% mitigated in dash if you use instantx/instantsend as it locks the transactions and prevents double spending... 
they wanted to demonstrate the power of InstantSend, to show Dash could send funds instantly, without issues of double-spending.
The DashnDrink was wheeled out to the North American Bitcoin Conference held in Miami in late January, where attendees successfully used the machine to purchase a drink using Dash in a matter of seconds.
The entire exchange made possible by InstantSend technology.
Evan Duffield, core developer of Dash, Holger Schinzel, head of quality management at Dash and Fernando Gutierrez released a whitepaper together on the concept in September 2014, titled, “Transaction Locking and Masternode Consensus: A Mechanism for Mitigating Double Spending Attacks.”
To summarize, instant validation (or near instant validation) of payment with Dash is possible because of the digital currency’s strong masternode infrastructure, which ensures the network is always operational and so transaction locking and pursuant consensus among Masternodes can be conducted to complete the transaction.
“In most cases a transaction should be validated by the network within a few seconds of originally being broadcasted,” the whitepaper read in 2014.
The 2016 soda machine proved that to be true.


45%, it's better than wasting those block rewards on mining. everyone seems to be happy with the 45% and if they are not they can submit a proposal to the dash masternode network dgbb and vote for a different %. if the stake holds/masternode owners decide that is what is best for the network and increasing the dash price they will vote for said increase or decrease. 10% goes to the Decentralized Governance by blockchain (dgbb) and 45% to miners. 45/45/10.

well maybe you can set me straight where the monero troll army all failed to.
it's kind of hard to deny the facts when i use their (monero team) own quotes.
are you claiming that the cripplemine did not happen or that monero did/does not have a hyper inflationary mining reward geared toward the early adopters? lol they knew it was a problem but choose not to do anything to fix it, don't believe, it's all conveniently laid out for anyone to check for themselves. i just made statements of facts and provided the proof with their on quotes and post.
 the monero troll army can downvote me as much as they want but they can not dispute the facts.

your thoughts on this.....
"Zerocoin can be used however we, as a democracy, decide it should be used. Once the technology exists, we as citizens can have a discussion about what degree of privacy is appropriate. For example, we might decide that transactions should be hidden from your neighbors — as they already are in traditional payment systems — but that the government should have access upon obtaining a valid warrant. If we make this decision, Zerocoin can easily be configured to accommodate that access."
