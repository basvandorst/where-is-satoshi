Nice! Might I ask what program did you use for your video editing?  Looking for a good one to make video game highlights with something overlayed.

Difficulty has increased dramatically since then.  I was there, and I believe it was a significant percentage of the network, not the entire network.  But I could be mistaken.

Every Monday from 5 to 7 PM at Union Square park.  Meet at the north end near the statue.

If you are under 1k per day you should be fine.

One big reason:  government is abusing their power as taxing authority:

Awesome, sorry to be clueless--but what is Nandroid?

Will I be forced to verify my name and personal info?
@_date: 2013-09-04 05:22:45
I believe 4tuna as well.  I have never used them so can't verify / speak to service, but I remember them posting on here.

Well the current upward price is being driven by adoption across the globe as opposed to just speculators--makes me happy!

coinbase is the best and most trusted company.  many high profile investors.  just fyi some people have had major issues with campbx but others report no problem

I am OK with people promoting their business as long it uses bitcoins.  I am very interested in learning where I can spend my bitcoins, and I think others might be interested as well.  
One incentive for companies to accept bitcoins is that they can get some increased business by posting on sites like this--totally fine with me!

Friedcat's updates typically come a day after dividends.  Just because a whale is dumping shares doesn't mean Friedcat should change his MO.

Why do you say its current rate of inflation is 10%?
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:13:00
You guys are both confusing inflation and dilution.  Dilution does not necessarily lead to inflation.  Ceteris parabus it will lead to inflation, but other factors must be considered (economic growth, new user adoption, current users decide to save more bitcoins, etc).  
Unless you purchased during the bubble's run-up, the currency has been deflationary for most users.

I agree that the dividend may not last, but the ponzi scheme accusation is absurd.  Friedcat is only person that has proven capable of manufacturing ASICs at a reasonable cost and time.  He is also working on the next generation.  Unlike others (read scammers) that promise models before actually creating them, he actually makes working prototypes before selling.
He has consistently been able to maintain 20+% of the network despite difficulty increases.  I bet he has some additional firepower in the wings.

I believe you mean liens instead of leans.  I will check for more now.  But great pamphlet!

Wait what?  Of course you must consider how changes of Bitcoin's value would affect your mining if you are considering purchasing a miner.  Why would you not consider that?
Of course if you already have a miner and running it would result in a loss at the current exchange rate--then you should just buy bitcoins.  But of course when considering mining bitcoins you must consider the price movements of bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-05-11 15:13:23
+1 Also many exchanges shut down.  So people can't get money into bitcoin right now.  Need to wait until next wave of exchanges come online.

Seals with Clubs is pretty great.  I signed up with PeterB and he sends me free chips periodically based on my play.  Site is still kinda small but growing.

Umm the Chinese government has been complaining about the USD's status as a world reserve currency since 2009.  It is not exactly a secret that why want to weaken the power of the Fed.  They don't want to destroy america, they just want a balance of power that they feel is more fair.

I think the leading theory is that it was the result of a [bug / user error in a CoinJoin transaction.](
@_date: 2013-08-28 14:31:10
So you're saying that you will achieve ROI in 4 months and everything after that is profit.  And your margin of error is too tight?  Only in the bitcoin world...
What product would you recommend purchasing?
@_date: 2013-07-31 18:54:21
Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man
@_date: 2013-08-28 15:26:19
So that is still 4 months of profit in addition to your .48 btc per blade.  Seems pretty good to me.  100% per month might also be overly aggressive.
What product do you recommend?
