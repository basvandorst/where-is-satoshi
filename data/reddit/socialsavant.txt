I've known from the beginning that it was a drunk typo and simply meant "hold". Seemed obvious to me. However, I do like to pretend that it is an acronym for that very phrase in the article. It's just more fun than a stupid typo and is almost more descriptive and accurate to the point.

Does that mean that we would get a free moon that would quickly crash while the original flies off into the heavens? I'm not sure that I like this idea...

That is terrible parenting and a terrible analogy. Ignoring bad behavior will never teach good behavior and these trolls aren't your children which you have some form of authority over.

I like to pretend that HODL is Holding On [for] Dear Life. So this would be Laughing On for Dear Life???

Thank you for reminding me about the save button and what it is good for.

Living in Washington State (land of the most onerous laws in the US regarding crypto exchanges) has left me with only one real option... Gemini. They may be limited elsewhere, but I applaud them for doing what it takes to operate where others will not. (I'm looking at you Kraken.)

Short answer: yes. You'll be fine once you have a personally held and solely controlled paper wallet.

I've used Armory for several years now. I have successfully recovered my wallet after a hardware failure using paper wallet that it creates and prints for you. You can also create offline/watching pairs for some serious tin-hat-wearing air-gapped security. Among other safety measures. Might take a bit of learning/getting used to, but is the safest wallet software that I know of.
