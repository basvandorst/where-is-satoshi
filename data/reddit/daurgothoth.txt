I think you are unaware of the negative effects mandatory inflationary currencies carry and worse what distortions in the market price discovery central banks cause. The combination leads to more expensive healthcare, food and is generally used to finance war so bitcoins could actually do a lot in the healing the sick, feeding the hungry, assisting the crippled and limiting or ending national warfare from the perspective that it could level the financial playing field.

This would be unrealistic. The shares sold at IPO are only worth a certain amount of GH/s, they only have a certain amount of shares and space for hardware. If more people buy into petamine it becomes less profitable for new buyers as the stock price increases. So basically, this won't happen because it would be too expensive. peta is undervalued right now, but wouldn't be if anything over 2% of total miners try to buy shares equal to what they are already mining. 


Yes, but no war on bitcoin has been announced and regulation has been extremely friendly to miners so far.


It means they are not part of a standard mining pool and therfor not a part of any 51% attack. Read up on what p2pool is at [whatisp2pool]( The basic thing is it eliminates the 51% attack problem if most of the miners run on a p2pool.


Run your own bitcoin node, point your miner at p2pool.


If you buy now you could possibly vote for joining p2pool if CryptX decides to bring it to a shareholder vote. Due to recent events he will most likely ask the shareholders.

That is true, but I was not discussing the weight behind the organization. I was stating that it acts as a central bank for central banks, which it does and it does act as the lender of last resort when needed. True not even a majority of the time, but it does happen. The SDRs are weak, and the bank has little pull over central banks at this time sure, but it still has some pull on them and that should not be overlooked sense it operates the same way, via fiat.
To be fair, the world didn't come to the fed in 08, the fed went to the world handing out gift-baskets and we didn't even find out about the foreign loans until recently due to the lack of transparency.

You are comparing apples and oranges. Bitcoin is 5yo, do I claim it is ready to take over as the world reserve currency right now? Of course not, however with its current growth it could be a very good contender for that position in 5 to 10 years. You can accept bitcoin without taking any of the volatility risk. Also your business probably isn't expanding at a similar rate to bitcoin, your growth is probably more linear. I did not say you should use a log-scale for everything. I said it is probably in your best interest to take a look at it if you are trading bitcoin or buying bitcoin because it can tell you when the best time to buy generally is.

war with Italian city states, defaults prior and after war.
french religion wars ended right after a default.
war with the Ottomans also had a default prior and during the war.
Does it stop bad leaders who claim a divine right to rule? No. However it limits the ability to wage war and war can't be waged indefinitely without control of the currency.  
Look I have said it several times, it does not end all wars. But it would end endless war and limit a nations capacity to wage war.

Bitcoin is enabling something that wasn't possible before. Yes, it looks like bitcoin's first killer app will be changetip.

Let me explain the problem with that. If any government tries to monopolize bitcoin, you can bet that it will start an ASIC arms race. The west can't let the east win and the east can't let the west win. On top of that, if someone 51%s the network then tries to force a change in protocol, all that would create is a hardfork. They can't force everyone else to update so even if 1 suborn rebel with his laptop running a full node said no to that update, bitcoin could survive.

"They Give You Cash, Which Is Just as Good as Money"
Bitcoins are cash money. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 07:14:55
1. Neither is gold.
2. The volatility is why most of us noticed bitcoin to begin with. The possibility of getting rich in the coarse of 5 years is pretty attractive. You can't go up fast without having some fast dips too.
3. Programmable money is instantly interchangeable using services like coinbase or bitpay for whatever form of money you prefer so bushiness can accept bitcoin with 0 risk. That isn't close to 0 or near 0, it is literally 0 risk to the price of bitcoins. 
4. Gold is almost exclusively hoarded as well. We dig it up, melt it into pretty shapes and then bury it in metal boxes. Just because gold is hoarded doesn't mean it is in one giant bubble. 
5. Coinbase and Bitpay do not move the risk to their books at all, they exchange the money at the point of sale for the merchant. They have 0 risk from going bankrupt with this service because it is adding to their bottom line through fees and they do not keep the bitcoins themselves as a speculation. 
6. The majority of start-ups in the internet in the 90s went bankrupt too. A few didn't, maybe you heard of a particularly big one called google. Don't keep your bitcoins on an exchange, problem solved. 
7. Prove I own my bitcoins and then we can talk about your imaginary future taxes that may or may not be imposed sometime in the next 100 years. While we are at it lets discuss the problems in the current moon rover for everyday commute on the future moon colony. 
8. Transactions are instant and irreversible, this actually ends up being a plus over credit cards that could get charge-backed up to six months later. Services will eventually arise for consumers that want insured transactions for an additional cost but this will not be imparted onto all users in the form of high transaction fees like the credit card companies. Charge-backs are extremely hard on small businesses. 
9. Again insured transactions will be provided when there is enough demand for this service. However at this time bitcoiners generally know to handle them like digital cash and would rather keep 100% of their bitcoins instead of paying fees for mandatory insurance. Multi-signature wallets address the rest of your 'omg it could be stolen' arguments. So could your computer Mr.Bitcorn, tell me should we all have mandatory insurances on all our computers too? By the way coins out of circulation add value to the rest of them still circulating. 
10. Economic stability? *seriously?* was 2008 really that long ago? Or are all those problems magically gone now because the talking heads on your tv are not mentioning them anymore? Bitcoin exists as an alternative because states have abused the responsibility of managing currency. The digital revolution started with eliminating state control over media and will continue with bitcoin and eliminating state control over currency. Separation of state and currency couldn't be a bigger advantage. 
How does anyone take this guy seriously anymore?

only private highways have historically used tolls and government funded highways still sometimes use tolls so that is a pretty bad point. The free market would provide for anything in demand, including roads. Roads appeared without taxes in america prior to 1913, paved roads. 
The American healthcare system is horrible. I am speaking about America and the healthcare system is now in control of government sense the obamacare insurance takeover, our healthcare is run by insurance here. 
Government may not try to but that is the outcome. No taxes are necessary if you have a national currency. America proved this prior to the revolution then for 120+ years after the revolution when we had almost no taxes at all with the exception of tariffs.

Even if the government builds enough miners to own over 51% of the network, we could update the protocol and hard-fork away from whatever changes they wanted to implement with the remaining 49%.

The 51% attack is not as big of a problem as everyone makes it out to be. For starters, it isn't fatal. The fixes that have been implemented by altcoins may not work for the bitcoin network, so implementing a potentially damaging fix to fix a problem that isn't serious may be more trouble than it is worth. 
P2Pool is probably a better solution and will not require a hardfork. Every time this has happened in the past, the pool with 51% has voluntary scaled down.

CryptX is great at listening to the community, that is why I am long on petamine. It isn't about getting rich quick although bitcoin itself does a decent job of that.

I took the 110% pledge before spending any coins this holiday season. Buying back 110% of the coins I spend. If I start to conduct all my buisness in bitcoin with only a 1 month volatility protection plan it is still possible for me to lose some coins over buying at the bottom in long bear runs. However I will not pretend I know what the market will do or where the bottom is exactly so this is the next best option to being omnipotent.  The time line was 23 days from my enitial announcement, just a favorite number of mine with enough time to set it all up. Basically I have been waiting to do this sense I discovered bitcoin and even though the bill paying might be hard to workout for the most part I think a bitcoin debit card will handle it.

Maybe but the way I see it;
One is an analog legacy system that runs on obsolete technology with services that are also obsolete, most of which should of failed in 08. The latest great invention to add value? The ATM. 
The other is a digital protocol that updates and adapts constantly with services that are doing things that wasn't even possible before. Latest great invention? Too many to count. 
So one is banking on enforcing arbitrary rules to shut out competition and the other is encouraging competition so that it may adapt even quicker than they can change the rules. Between the two, only one has a future. The big banks are running on fumes, leveraged up to their eyeballs and any wrong move at this point could spell disaster. The Bitcoin network on the other hand has plenty of room to maneuver.

Because saying "government currency" is not an insult to the word currently to 96% of the population. They think its a GOOD thing because it gives them Financial stability' in the markets. This is the level of brainwashing normal people are under. So all you are really doing is taking away the small amount of people who get converted after they look up what fiat means. Then they start asking questions themselves and that is the only way to convince people. Going around calling things government may be an insult to 5% of us that get it but the rest will just look at you like some wana be revolutionary.

And I will point to regulatory capture and the media capture. Without the 4th estate of responsible journalism we can't hold them accountable. Educating the public is a lost cause, you said so yourself when you mentioned not underestimating the apathy of the public. No of course you could vote for anyone on the ballet but the other votes don't count and haven't for a long time. It always comes down to the red vs blue partisan divide and conquer lesser of two evils. 
So educating the public is out. The answers are already there for those who look for them.
Personal responsibility? in this day and age? That falls under educating the public because the majority of sheeple now want everything done for them and they are deluded into the mindset that they are still free even if they give up all responsibility. 
So the only thing left is the oldest method, pain. Until the public is in hurting enough to look for the answers they will not enforce drastic changes. Only when they get desperate will the majority start to understand the need for something completely different. And that is exactly were the current system is headed. 
Its like the End the fed movement. as if. Transcend the fed. Bypass the fed. That is how we are going to change the system, and by doing this we will break the fed. You don't join a gang to try and convince them to stop using violence. The same is true for politics. Even though Ron Paul was great at educating people and getting people to think differently his measurable effect on the system as a whole was mute. Media bias and well funded opponents won out every time.

@_date: 2014-11-04 02:20:20
I agree with what your saying but wouldn't go so far as to say it was the people's fault for who we elected. To be fair we only get to chose between two people, both of which are funded and ultimately in the pocket of the banks with very few exceptions and even those exceptions could be controlled oposition. With the amount of collusion between banks, regulators and politicians they act as a single entity now. Mission statements be damned we need to judge them by the actions they take and over the last decade the revolving doors make the offices nearly interchangeable. The fed has no power over the big 4 anymore, if it ever did and the politics of Washington are to preach one thing and do the opposite. Orwell would be laughing his ass off at the current state of affairs. 2000+ students get arrested for protesting the actions of these corrupt bankers and not a single regulator or banker gets investigated much less charged. 
The system may be operational but only the most deluded of people can claim it works or isn't in need of a wholesale replacement. At this point it is an all or nothing situation. If bitcoin fails to seperate money from state I fear a violent revolution may become necessary and no one wants that. 
I think bitcoin may reach a point we're people don't even know they are using it just like most people can't seperate the internet and world wide web. I don't think the majority will be drawn to the libertarian message, my stance is they will convert out of necessity and only when they realize they need an alternative. So buckle up because more global financial crises will arrise without significant changes and those changes won't happen before they are forced due to the amount of influence the current system has. 
Tl;dr the system needs to be broken for change to happen and bitcoin can break it.

Well of course the system works but it is also broken. Regulatory capture allowed the banks to make those incredibly risky bets with others people's money, create the crisis, then beat the system. Not one was held accountable and everything they did is still legal and they are definetly still doing it so it will happen again. This is why I say the system is obsolete. The only reason it held together was 3 different blank checks from taxpayers and they are already talking about a 4th, or else. They hold the world hostage and demand we give them more or we lose everything. 
Bitcoin offers a choice and while it will coincide with the original system it will eventually replace the entire thing when crisis after crisis hits these corrupt institutions. Every time more and more people will lose faith and look for the alternative. Eventually this will reach critical mass and even central banks will lose the ability to manipulate markets when a majority of transactions happen in bitcoin. They may not die completely but they will have to fundamentally change they way they operate and accept the new separation of money and state. 
To top it all off this only applies to the developed world. They are not even trying to serve the other 6 billion people who don't have bank accounts and in that arena bitcoin has a huge advantage. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 01:19:43

The market already does a reverse of this where the next biggest company to accept bitcoin gets a ton of press and new business. Like overstock, then newegg, now dell. It rewards the next largest player to start accepting bitcoin.
What you suggest doesn't sound like it would be terribly effective considering unanimous opinions in a decentralized system are hard to come by and not many would even hear about such a boycott. We are not a union.

Thanks for your support, yes it will be more than 50% but I do have a backup just in case. I would argue it was more risky when it was smaller and with less infrastructure to go all bitcoin. I think people put too much into the pricetag, the limited quantity means they will be worth a heck of a lot more than 3 digits if successful. I'm in the camp that Bitcoin can adapt too fast to be overtaken by any competitors and most of the institutions it threatens don't have much of a nack for being creative or adapting anymore. That said I was a bit afraid of a gcoin but now I think Google might be backing bitcoins in order to establish itself as a dominate financial services provider.

My biggest personal accomplishment with bitcoin so far... great question, definitely need this up on a dedicated website as a go to for bitcoin PR. 
I have not really done anything monumental yet and I am just excited to help out where I can so far, right now mostly just tipping where I can using the awesome changetip. I was going to get more closely involved with Letstalkbitcoin, especially with the marketing side of things but due to an emergency(bad car accident, legal battles and family emergency) had to put that on hold and they moved on to someone else. Maybe getting more than 10 bitcoins, yet again problems arose and I lost them to a computer crash on thanksgiving. (transferred them to cold storage, didn't print the wallet before I transferred, went to print and no paper, 30 minutes later boom.) 
My road with bitcoin has been hard, yet each time I get knocked down I never really feel out. I suppose it isn't really an accomplishment unless you count getting over the sense of hopelessness instilled in you by american public education system but bitcoin gives me hope of a better tomorrow, no matter how bad things get.

Shareholders with over 5% of the mine have direct contact information. The weekly updates are good enough for the majority of the shareholders, be patient or sell if you lost faith in cryptX. He is busy and doesn't need to respond to this weeks complaint list. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 01:52:20
It depends on how they have the system set up but in a mining operation I would hope the administrators would take the time to double and triple check before flipping the switch. CryptX built a good mine so far and made pretty good decisions along the way, i think switching to p2pool is one of them and I trust that it is being done. Now if we get to a month down the road, or the weekly updates stop explaining the situation this may be valid criticism that it wasn't high up enough on the priority list but with petahashes worth of mining hardware is on the line it doesn't seem reasonable to assume it would be done in the first 2 weeks.

Yes there is but if citizens saw rising taxes for war that is another form of a bill that is more easily registered than the hidden inflation tax that liberals think is a fairy tale despite all evidence.

You can get everything you need online in some areas. If it is online you can use some sort of payment processing service like snapcard to use bitcoins even if the store doesn't accept them. Thus you can get everything you need with bitcoin, with the exception of paying utilities or taxes. Yes you can rent or buy property with bitcoin.

True, bitcoins value is only truly exponential during bubble season but considering it has made a habit of returning to bubble season every year I am willing to go out on a limb and just saying on a logarithmic scale, bitcoin's growth is relatively stable. So I suppose the correct mathematical term is cubic growth?
@_date: 2014-06-13 23:55:33


Yes. 


You own a percentage of GH/s and it is stated that the shares will not be diluted without expanding the mine so all shares represent more GH/s. PETA has expanded a few times already going from 2.4 GH/s to now over 15 GH/s.


Dividends are paid weekly. 50% of the dividends are used to reinvest in new hardware so your GH/s increases over time.

The term debt-slave is not new and does not spontaneously compare to any other slave unless specifically compared. Just because you make the assumption does not mean everyone needs to be worried about what you may infer. It is like saying  "Lets not go to the moon because it might offend the religious community."

In 1 year, bitcoin went from "magic internet money for nerds" to being a threat to the established system. Every major private bank, hedge fund and central bank has released official reports on bitcoin. We have passed pro bitcoin legislation in places like Russia and California. 


Wrong, [here is the fresh state of bitcoin coindesk report that proves it.](


If all your friends jumped off a cliff....
Honestly, we are sitting at over 600% YTD and news articles containing bitcoin are up about 500% You are not reading enough news. People from goldman sachs, paypal and billionaires like the walden's are now taking an active interest. 
Global change doesn't happen in days, weeks or months and bitcoin is setting a new land-speed record because it might do it in a decade.

1. Bitcoin changes the world simply by exsisting. 
2. Mass adoption is happening now and the anarchist roots of bitcoin will not change before or after it does.
3. The experiment left the garage and it's now standing. It has started the march to standardization and scalability. We will be running before 2016 and moon bound by 2020.
3. Can't have solutions without problems.
4. You say don't look for problems but look for weakness? Same thing, and both are discussed regularly. You won't find it here in often anymore now that the average Joe's are getting interested. Listen to the developer conversations.
The biggest barrier to bitcoin isn't the need for an enemy. We have plenty. Most didn't know it until recently and the centralization has finally gone against them. They didn't see the threat till it was too late. Now they can steer into the skid, embrace bitcoin and in doing so help it grow. Or fight a losing battle against it, for example mastercard, and they will only make bitcoin stronger. Either way bitcoin wins, and if they chose not to play then we have clear skies and smooth sailing. 
Shills are called out regularly and maybe sometimes incorrectly but they are here. Plenty of doc leaks have proved big corporations hire them to argue online. There is also a select group of bitcoiners that play shill for free thinking the longer they keep people away the lower they can buy. 
Buttcoiners can claim they enjoy satire till the cows come home but the majority in that sub actually belive half the bitcoin common myths and actively spout them  with piles of logical fallacies. I personally don't see any positive from them. Bitcoin weaknesses are actively discussed by those with respect and responsibilities for the care of bitcoin.

Wrong. Centralization of mining does not mean the system is unsustainable and he offers no argument for it. He assumes that  mining will continue to centralize, not accounting for the decentralization that occurs every time we make an evolutionary jump in mining hardware and also assumes a centralized mining operation would elect to jeopardize the bitcoin network for potentially more profit, instead of insuring the stability of the network and operating a lasting business.

My point is we get all the updates here on reddit because people are eager to post the news 24/7. We get the update when so and so releases a report or when company X accepts bitcoin.

It is easy to want the world to change right this second and many of us here feel like we could be moving 1000 times faster than we already are as an industry but reality is bitcoin is expanding fast enough to be extraordinarily profitable but slow enough that it can adapt as it goes.

He wasn't prior to 2005. He was right and he is right about them not addressing the problems. They slapped duct tape on it and held it together for a few more years. Now the turmoil in the oil markets will lead to hedge fund and investment bank defaults and we will start the game all over again. Except this time they will probably try a bail-in sense the banks are pushing for the coupons they hold in  deposits to be reclassified from money to paper investments. This will allow them to do bail-in whenever they want without approval from anyone.

The free market is the strongest, fastest and most creative. The fed's manipulated market is a house of cards built on a global ponzi scheme it no longer has control over. Janet Yellen is getting ready for what she hopes will be a controlled debt implosion but I doubt much will be left standing after this one. Interesting how unstable the normal markets are with such a grand and omnipotent fed watching over them. I could sit here and try to link you to stories and try and explain a 100 years of actual history to you on how the central bank came to control education and how it helped maintain and strengthen our glorious military but it is pretty simple.

1) To buy or sell bitcoin on Coinbase, you must link your account to a US-based bank account. Make an account at wells fargo, get a debit card and enter it into your coinbase account.
2) After you deposit the cash and you link your account go to coinbase and buy as much or as little as you want with the funds from your debit account.

Banks are already taking a hard line against bitcoin, blocking and closing accounts related to it. We have seen that sense bitcoin launched.

If gov declares it outright illegal, they basically are saying its a threat to the system. You do that you lock in the anarchists, libertarians and some of the center that knows gov is corrupt and failing.If they mine bitcoins to sell them later, they are still using it and you can not sell enough bitcoins to put us at $100 let alone $0. Even if they try to take control of the network or protocol, we can hardfork. Bitcoin does not need to be 'legitimized' by any member of the current system. Bitcoin is legitimate because of how it operates, not because gov hasn't 'crushed' it yet.

If you could predict the bitcoin ecosystem you would already be rich. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:20:07
That is irrelevant, we are talking about taxes on bitcoins. If I made bitcoins with a bitcoin service, I sure as shit wouldn't pay taxes on them either.

This must only apply to fiat fractional reserve economies because bitcoin's growth is not tied to credit of any kind. 
Your theory has some holes.

Here is a good article on nations going broke.  These nation's capacity for war greatly diminished after going broke. Such nations like the Romans are a prime example.

Again if I knew how to accurately define commercially available for bitcoin, I wouldn't of had to ask.

We have a big awesome going away present for the establishment cuz they won and Bitcoin lost. It's a great big wooden horse. We hope they like it. 
P.S. Let it pass the gate before you read all the carvings inside, what difference could it make, right guys?

@_date: 2015-02-20 03:18:50
Have you come up with an actual argument? 
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:40:00
If your too stupid to understand I wasn't talking to you, judging by your history your ignorance will not be fixed with one conversation.
