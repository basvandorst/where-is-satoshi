Tor isn't nearly as slow these days. It seems the Snowden leaks were definitely good at giving everyone a kick in the pants. The browser bundle was updated to Firefox 24 and it's just as easy to install and use as any modern Firefox. There are no issues with it whatsoever. There's no reason people shouldn't use it.
Tor relays have to introduce some latency. That's the price you pay for a government run amok. Do you want online privacy or don't you? Do you want the NSA to build up a perfect profile of you and everything you say and do and who your friends are for the next several decades, or don't you?
And let's be reasonable here, convincing someone to install a free software program is way easier than convincing them to submit their national ID and proof of residency to a Bitcoin exchange in Slovenia. Followed by wiring thousands of dollars to Slovenia. That's one too more hurdles, to say the least, and the fact that Bitcoin is accepted by online retailers through BitPay with a 2% discount isn't going to convince many people to go through with that.
People already are getting paid in Bitcoin. But there's a difference between getting paid in Bitcoin and holding Bitcoin reserves. Currently we don't see any major merchant holding reserves. The only merchants doing that are alive and well on tor marketplaces. It's always been that way.
Too many people are trying to push Bitcoin on others as if that's going to change their minds about it. You should convince them to change their environment to something more conducive to cryptocurrency and the crypto will follow without you doing anything. Or you could approach it more like a pyramid scheme, clamoring to have everyone you know buy into Bitcoin. Next stop, Amway.

Dude, you rock for telling it how it is. However, I think this is more on the side of claiming Jamie Dimon isn't capable of critical thought. Nothing he said in the interview was unreasonable. He at least understands that Bitcoin is in diametric opposition to governments. This is sadly more realistic than many Bitcoiners would like it to be.
Wait, forget i said that. **Paging ToTheMoonGuy!!!!1111**

They won't make a centralized coin, obviously there's no incentive to do that because it's a failed model. Instead they'll decide to develop their own altcoin with an independent codebase. Fair's fair.
That way, instead of Google allowing the Bitcoin Foundation (an utter joke) to monopolize development of their core product, they'll take control. And you know what? Google has far better developer resources than the entire Bitcoin ecosystem put together. They have an unlimited development budget and some of the best engineers in the world working for them full time. If you think they're just going to stand back and make you a trillionaire, you have another thing coming.
I totally buy into Bitcoin, but at this point the Bitcoin Foundation and dumb fucking asshole American VCs are pushing Bitcoin into becoming PayPal 2.0. Basically they're telling everyone to play down the fact that Bitcoin has revolutionary potential in order to make the concept of cryptocurrency more palatable to people. **This will result in the demise of Bitcoin more than anything else**.
These VCs, when they go speaking about Bitcoin on TV, calling the black market bad and wagging their fingers, trivialize the revolutionary aspects. That way, the coin itself becomes irrelevant.
And you know what else? VCs don't give a fuck. Fred Wilson doesn't own any Bitcoin. Fred Wilson owns some *Coinbase* though, and Coinbase is about as loyal to Bitcoin as Fred Wilson is loyal to Bitcoin. Read: not at all. These investors are smarter than you kid. They invest their money wisely, and for all we know Bitcoin is massively overvalued today. Cryptocurrency is NOT overvalued, it is undervalued. But the rise of "cryptocurrency" does not necessarily mean the rise of Bitcoin.

Go ahead, sign up every merchant in the world to accept Bitcoin via BitPay. Average people will still have a difficult time submitting their national ID card and proof of residency to Slovenia. Just because you *can* pay for things with some new fangled payment network doesn't mean you will. Ask every unsuccessful payment startup ever. Bitcoin's main selling point is financial freedom as you said, but it's not financial freedom in the Amway bullshit marketer sense. It's financial freedom in the sense that you get to ditch the system, you get to evacuate banks and governments become irrelevant.
I'd also like to see you try to write that above paragraph without using Tor browser on an account connected to your name. There's a pronounced self-censorship effect 24/7 applied to the entire population based on indiscriminate global spying, and you know it. I find it petrifying to speak my mind, knowing the NSA is monitoring the entire Internet in real time. It's very liberating being able to speak my mind freely on the Internets once again thanks to the Tor browser bundle. Just one year ago, everyone thought Bitcoin was stupid. If you don't think there can be a surge in Tor popularity I don't know what to tell you besides think bigger. What I'm telling you is good for the price of Bitcoin, good for the Bitcoin economy, and good for people in general. It makes sense and it's going to become more popular. Indiscriminate spying isn't going away. There is no possible political recourse, all you can do is switch to the [Tor browser]( It runs just like modern Firefox. There's no reason not to switch. There's hardly any difference in user experience. And once you switch you'll know that Bitcoin is the only way forward in that environment. That's way more powerful than getting in-your-face at your neighbors about a pyramid scheme.
Buying into something because the price is going up is a weak reason to buy anyway. Greed always gives way to fear, and fear is the stronger emotion. For a sustainably high price you need a sustainable environment, and that environment is most definitely Tor.

No, not as simple as that. It's cheaper to buy things at walmart. Is that a compelling enough reason for you to run out to walmart today to buy groceries? Saving a miniscule amount, 2-3% doesn't even register with most consumers as a benefit. You need these merchants to give 10, 20, 33% off to get any traction. Heck 67% off is standard amongst marketers trying to make a screaming deal. My point is, fuck lowering fees.
Get people to use Tor Browser, full time. Don't even mention bitcoin. Because once more people use Tor and PGP to communicate, they'll quickly find that Bitcoin is the only way to pay in that environment. This is really what Satoshi designed bitcoin for, look it up. It was always about supporting the cyphereconomy for 1-2 years if we're lucky, never about lowering fees and all the other bullshit parroted by douchebags.
If I were the average consumer, saving 5-10% everywhere, while substantial, wouldn't be reason enough to jump through a million hurdles to buy Bitcoin. You need to make consumers realize that NSA spying can be thwarted through diligent use of Tor PGP and other anonymizing software. Once more people do this, Bitcoin will take off. BTC doesn't thrive in any other environment. In any other environment, credit cards are more convenient, generally safer for consumers, and come with Net 30 payment terms. You'd be hard pressed to overcome that with Bitcoin. Get people to use tor hidden services and decentralized architecture in their daily lives and then we're talking.
Everything else just amounts to BitPay or Coinbase or other intermediaries hyping up Bitcoin, by saying "now so and so accepts it". Yea it adds some liquidity here or there but none of these merchants are holding bitcoin, they're immediately selling it which actually puts downward pressure on the price. If price is all you care about, get more people using tor.

It's long been stated the biggest risk to Bitcoin is something better coming along. In light of this, people need to understand "innovation" in cryptocurrencies isn't necessarily about shorter block times, or having a eureka moment, or even integrating zerocoin. Some of the most important "innovations" won't be technically innovative, **at all**. At this point, it's more a matter of who or which company (cough Google Amazon) has the right social and political connections to take their coin the furthest with the banks, which is what Bitcoin appears to be competing on due to shortsightedness and greed; that will be the demise of Bitcoin if anything - that is, selling ourselves out.
There's also the fact that the Bitcoin codebase, being a monolithic poorly documented C++ mess, is quite possibly less than desirable to build upon as a platform going forward. Now that we know how to solve the Byzantine General's problem, there's no reason whatsoever to continue using the original Bitcoin codebase and the developers, talented as they are, have a long ways to go; and even then C++ may not be optimal.
Conformal has already produced a major contender in Go which is significantly cleaner, more modular, and more approachable; and Conformal looks to be providing better developer support than the Bitcoin Foundation combined with the documentation of Bitcoind or lackthereof.
In short, this is still the wild west. There's a reason investors are skeptical and it's honestly not only about being brainwashed into valuing fiat currency or shiny metal objects or perpetuating the state. It's because this is the wild west. Really, it is. There's a significant chance that Bitcoin *isn't the one*, and the chances of this being true get even higher as core devs take positions in American VC backed companies and otherwise sell themselves out, undermining privacy and thus confidence in the core technology. The slew of altcoins that are mere clones of bitcoind have it totally backwards. The real competitors will be the ones that build independent codebases, provide the best developer support, and the true victors will be the developers with the right political and banking connections.
No one ever said Google or Amazon wouldn't start over from scratch with their own coin. This way they get to see price appreciate from 0. They're not out to make you rich, they're out to make themselves rich. If cryptocurrency really is to become "yet another payment system" akin to PayPal 2.0, the fact that it's Bitcoin doesn't matter at all. If the only aspect of it that matters is sending USD from country A to county B affordably and quickly, it might as well be GoogleCoin or AmazonCoin. Most consumers don't know WTF Bitcoin is anyway, so they really have no reason to help early adopters become trillionaires. Hate to break it to you guys but this is just the truth.
If you want actionable insights, diversify, diversify diversify. Companies that don't have a hard dependency on BTC are the best investment, because they'll naturally evolve to deal in whatever cryptocurrency comes out on top. Investing in BTC only is a huge risk because BTC may not be the one. This is probably why Li Ka Shing, Fred Wilson, Andreesen Horowitz et al, invested in BitPay, Coinbase and other companies that have no hard dependency on one particular cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrency intermediaries and exchanges is the safest play, given that nobody knows WTF will happen to BTC, but basically everybody knows cryptocurrency is valuable in general.
If you don't have VC connections the options for investing in exchanges are quite limited:
