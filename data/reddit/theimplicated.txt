It takes greed
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:17:01
YOU SHOULD! The price is not justified, AT ALL. There is no reason for this price.

You remember the picture of the guy jumping to his death during the crash of 1929? He didn't panic sell - so he killed himself. 
Think before you speak. If you don't sell during a crash. You lose everything. Bitcoin will not bounce back if it has a massive correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:18:24
What do you mean when does it run out? 
What does running out of bitcoin have to do with anything?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:03:27
It will be an economic power. The US gets its power from multinational corporation influencing behavior from people around the globe.

winklevoss twins are trying to figure out a way to sell right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:15:49
What are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:01:16
What do you mean? It's a non productive asset. There would be no reason for it to come back.
We are experiencing irrational exuberance. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:01:18
What you are talking about is greed.

There is no reason for this price.

banks finance business operations. how you think things get made? 
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:43:19
Government enables an environment for business to operate.

Bitcoin is not "very easy to access". 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:49:37
Yeah these fools don't know what they are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:07:38
you ever wonder why politicians always bring up the debt - and never assets? 
Im sure you've heard of the debt clock but, have you ever heard of an asset clock? The debt is simple double entry accounting.
If you've ever got a loan before they ask to see your debt but, also your assets. The fact that people only ever show the debt clock and not the asset clock means they are trying to manipulate you. 
debt fears are based on total misinformation and ignorance. if the debt is 20 trillion dollars that simply means that the government in its 240 years spent 20 trillion more dollars than it took away in taxes. It has essentially transferred wealth to the public and now us as citizens hold that money.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:28:23
what are you talking about dude.. 
there are so many wrong statements in this post. 
jesus man.. you mentioned central banks... but, I think you mean to say "banks"... anyways.. banks are no "siphoning the wealth" they are being paid for providing a service. You agree to the loan. They can not give you the loan if you dont agree with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:08:36
How is government dwindling the wealth? Per capita income has grown precipitously. This is inherent in an inflationary environment. Our entire economy, the most powerful in the history of mankind, is based on investing over saving. A deflationary environment is what contributed to the Great Depression. 
The notion that the government is stealing wealth is the biggest crock of shit.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:01:39
What in the fuck are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:58:24
I don’t need a history lesson on bullshit.

It's not going to replace any currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:10:28
Fiat money isn't bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:18:39
Lol yeah people are dumb... people don’t understand that you can appreciate bitcoin and fiat
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:49:11
You are brainwashed. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:56:49
what does that even mean? 
debt doesnt matter. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:47:08
I’m not into conspiracy theories sorry bro.

you just vomited a bunch of rhetoric up. none of those ideas you've thrown out are yours and you don't have a clue to what you're talking about. 
China is selling US treasuries but, Russia is buying them. Why? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:40:05
I never said it prevents it from going to 0. Taxation is why it has value from the start. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:22:18
A government saying that taxes or payments must be settled in government money, drives a need for individuals and businesses to obtain the currency. Which inherently gives it its value. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:16:43
Again you just repeat the same dribble without actually saying anything. 
I don't know why you're talking about a cash ban. I never said I was against bitcoin. You're a trip
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:22:39
you haven't refuted shit. you're aren't even saying anything. you are talking about zimbabwe and venezuela. The US dollar is a reserve currency and a safe haven for people around the globe. Hyperinflation will never happen in America because our Federal Reserve is not politicized. 
Venezuela's problems are tied directly to nationalism and China's pay day loan scam. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:40:35
Bitcoin behaves like a bubble.
The reason the US dollar has value is because it is the only way you can pay taxes and you are required to pay taxes, so at some point you have to own dollars. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:24:18
Now that I see you are some conspiracy theorist... do you think we should go back to the gold standard? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:29:38
oh yeah.. the "serious economists" LOL 
who's your go to economist when you are looking to reinforce your ideas. Well.. not your ideas persay because you likely don't have any. 
Who should i follow more closely. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:42:33
While we are making requests, can we at least acknowledge that bitcoin is absolutely behaving like a bubble. It is textbook definition of bubble like behavior. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:02:51
Why is $21T is debt by the US not sustainable?

You don't understand central banking then.

We need to get rid of piece of shit lawyers trying to ruin this great nation.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:13:37
No, we don't. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:48:44
No.. You don't need to get rid of government.

This man isn't rich LOL Rich people live like they're rich. Just because my dad steals napkins from restaurants doesn't mean we don't spend an exorbitant amount of money on shit we don't need.
