Sorry, meant to reply to his thread

Betteridge's law of headlines indeed. No.

ASIC bitcoin mining wasn't around four years ago

Well at least the URL is unique and I think the CBS NEWS article I posted is better than the NBC one.
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:07:57
Awesome to see
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:48:26

I2P has been around since 2003, TOR since 2002 -- aren't we nitpicking a little? 
I2P does a lot actually.

alright alright but I got so excited
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:26:37
Perhaps the author of that article spent too much time on the wiki

I use Chrome too. Top of my head I would guess PCW gave you a lovely ad or tracker over HTTPS. Actually looking at it Ghostery found 25 trackers on  yikes!!!!
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:45:16
yes, have patience... BTC may even hit $2000+ one day.

Did you make a copy prior to sending it to kroll ontrack ? If USB drive try plugging it into the USB port you used initially prior to mounting. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:43:52
Yes wallet is fully synced.

Yet checking blockchain  yields Sorry we could not find any blocks or transactions matching this hash
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:52:04
this checks out!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:08:47
No luck :(  still zero confirmations and when I try to send it again it says:
This transaction is over the size limit. You can still send it for a fee of 0.10 BTC, which goes to the nodes that process your transaction and helps to support the network. Do you want to pay the fee
0.10 BTC is no joke :( that's like over $60 ish. I cancelled and when I tried it again a few minutes ago the fee dropped to 0.09. I guess this various depending on network load?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:54:30
My cat was napping on the keyboard. Sorry about that. Carry on.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:14:57
Thank you. That's exactly what I did and re-imported =)

Great idea. I didn't know one could do that. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:59:47
Any luck at your end?
Checking the TX through blockchain said 2 hours but it now went back to 7 hours ETA. Unfortunately it's been over 72h.

Interesting. Yes Bitcoin-QT. Most inbound transactions were about 0.1 BTC 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:37:23
That's great news. I only have a 30GH/s miner so those 1BTC took me a while, learned a lot though. Anyways, thank you and best of luck :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:22:53
Happy End!
I like Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:20:41
He DOES Exist!
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:27:19
Thank you. I will try this and report back. My routers UPnP works pretty well and usually i have about 9 or more connections to the bitcoin network. My other wallets work and the strange thing is that I can send BTC from my wallet to my friends wallet without any problems -- he usually receives within 1-2 hours but when I send to BTCe or Coinbase the transaction just goes nowhere.
ok, so I will try assigning a static DHCP lease, punch TCP 8333, backup wallet, run Bitcoin-QT -salvagewallet and retry. Let's see if you are a prophet ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:19:00
Someone forgot to tell   which, as always, has plenty of traders in India.
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:11:36
Balance varies. Got the funds to cover the transaction. I am not sure but I suspect the wallet would not let me send otherwise.

Thanks for the suggestion. I've already fiddled with fees but what fee would you suggest? I think in the GUI have set 0.0001
