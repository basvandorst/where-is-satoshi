Don’t put your money into someone else’s wallet wtf

Everyone here will tell you to go for it. And you should, only with money that you can afford to lose. I’ve sunk $250 in bitcoin, I’ve got like $400 worth now. It’s a blast, talking to people about it, telling new people about it, being part of the community, making money from nothing. Go for it.

Fuck off dude. One of your last few posts is about some bitcoin gambling ring you’re running or trying to rope people into.

Yeah your scam detector should be going off. Just get a software wallet, bread on iOS or Mycelium on Android. Send your coins there and write down your 12 secret words and store them in your safest place. They’re as good as having you Bitcoin.  Same with your private keys.

I don't know shit so I could be entirely wrong but:
As far as I know segwit2x is just how the coins are moved around. It doesn't matter until you go to move them.

That's not a ton, the 24 hour trade volume is already 241 million dollars.

Eh, if the retailer can confirm that it was sent that would be good enough for a coffee shop. Not really any other type of store though
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:51:07
Got any evidence for that or are you calling people "errrrr wrong" based upon your feelings

It probably took me 20 tries on Coinbase, just keep trying. I found the best way was to take the pictures on my phone and upload them via my PC. If that doesn't work try contacting their support.

It's just a meme:

Bitcoin as a concept, bitcoins when talking about a literal amount.
"I found a hard drive full of bitcoin"
"I bought two bitcoins"

I bought a 100 billlion just recently, the 100 bil costs $6 while the 100 tril costs like $50

I just bought my first 0.02 a few minutes ago after I watched it go up 2,000 dollars in 2 weeks

The fork has people antsy. It'll rise after the fork as people lose interest in B2X

 “There is nothing to support bitcoin except the hope that you will sell it to someone for more than you paid for it”
Yes, they call these economies. That’s how everything works.

If it's ever going to work as money then yes. If it's just going to store value and not be used as a currency then probably not.

*You* have 100d/8u, as do I. What does your grandpa have? What does that Inuit village in Alaska have? They need to be able to distribute the blocks as well.

You probably know better than I do. I'm still learning this stuff, but doesn't everyone need to be able to access the blockchain?
