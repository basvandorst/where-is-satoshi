[Even though they discontinued this vault back in August 31, 2017]( if you had it before then you can still use it. 
Basically this vault is a nice way to secure your funds and have your own private keys on Coinbase. 
So, even if Coinbase close their doors tomorrow, you still would be able to withdraw your funds. 
The best part: you can set custom fees and avoid the high fees that Coinbase deducts when you send using their normal wallet.

Yeah I wish I could but since I live here, I don't know if I should do that or not.

Okay lemme be a bit more clear. I'm living in the US but I'm not here legally. My parents brought me here when I was younger. I'm 19 now. I went to school and graduated but I'm not a legal permanent resident nor US citizen. I don't have a SSN or even a driver's license because I can't (unless I move to one of those states that allows you to get driver's licenses without a SSN or permanent resident card). 
The only document I have is my non-US Passport. I entered this country with my parents legally but they overstayed their tourist visas (I did too because I had no choice)

I don't know. The difference might be that, you can buy Bitcoin from a non-US exchange and since this would not be from a US source I wouldn't have to pay capital gain tax? But if I buy a car in the US for 10k and sell it for 15k then I think I might have to pay capital gains because I bought it from a US seller?
Honestly, these are just assumptions. That's why I'm asking. And I don't have the money to consult a professional. That's why I'm asking here. :/
Thanks for your advice!

The thing is that I was born in a country that doesn't have capital gain taxes. But I don't live there. I live in the US. So that's why I'm asking.

Wait, why the hell does he needs to prove his identity to access the funds? It's a wallet not an exchange. Even Coinbase lets you use their wallet without going through AML/KYC. You only need to proof your identity to buy or sell.
I recommend you using a legit wallet like Coinomi
