how many you have?
@_date: 2016-04-08 00:09:08
he is amazing
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:37:03
This guy deserves this and much more. This guy doesn’t deserve to be a millionaire; he deserves to be a billionaire.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:05:31
but that amount isn't on the market. that is why the price is surging.
if i have 100bi of something and i put on the market only 1m, it will surge and my other coins will make the marketcap
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:09:07
i am curious how this guy created is safe segwit cold storage  address. don't you mind to explain?
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:15:43
Let’s do this
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:58:22
And it is USA-only. Coinbase is worldwide
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:25:05
iOS ???
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:38:47
I am talking about emojis.
The unicode symbol is required to create an emoji. We already have it, so the proposal becomes a lot easier.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:52:57
I hope that bread supports segwit soon. @_date: 2018-01-29 18:25:53
paid version with quality coding for iOS, please.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:06:19
Thank you my friend
@_date: 2018-09-14 15:02:08
The irony: dollars in the car
@_date: 2018-09-03 11:24:40
How did you do that graph?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:48:01
upvote this shit to the eternity
@_date: 2018-09-30 22:00:53
We should use k and M, but not G or T.
Above 100M we should only use BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:30:38
Please, stick this everywhere.
@_date: 2018-09-30 21:58:47
We should only use k, M and BTC.
100k sat
100M sat
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:44:11
THOSE ARE NOT THE DOORS OF A BILLIONAIRE
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:11:49
Thank you :D
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:24:58
So, is it time to sell?
@_date: 2018-09-03 11:19:29
Wise man
@_date: 2018-08-07 11:49:54
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:21:53
That will never happen. Is so stupid even today talk in bitcoins! Nobody says give me zero dot zero zero zero zero one bitcoins.
Everybody SHOULD TALK TODAY IN SATOSHIS! SATOSHIS ARE THE FUTURE.
That bill are 31 cents of satoshi
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:29:06
Because we should believe dollars are shit. If we really believe in bitcoin, we should measure fortune in bitcoins. Not in dollars.
It is like roger ver betting 1m dollars when he tried to endorse bcrash in the recent debate.
It is simply stupid as fuck and debunks who says it.
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:52:05
We just need to support him like russia did with trump. Let’s make this man the president of brazil, reddit.
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:48:07
It is easier to say “2300 sats”
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:32:50
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:10:29
Do you have the link, please?
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:35:05
You are right, Sir.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:37:45
Thanks for that
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:15:03
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:47:47
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:29:39
thank you so much
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:33:13
I am out of the loop. What is wrong with circle? Thanks in advance
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:47:56
Explain me the segwit thing please.
If we will double the block, why the segwit?
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:46:15
I really want to use bitsquare but it has very few peers/transactions... :/
@_date: 2016-11-15 01:29:14
What is this? I need to do something or be worried? Soft fork??
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:35:34
That's stupid.
Nobody will talk in bitcoins. But SATOSHIS!!
That bill is 0,31 SATOSHIS
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:16:28
What is that? Coindays destroyed?
@_date: 2018-06-03 21:55:48
Is there any other lightning app for iOS? Or is this the first one?
@_date: 2015-07-19 18:47:01
that price is from where? btc-e?
bitcoin has multiple trading centers with different prices.
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:07:33
You guys are STILL the best. The professionalism, knowledge and the perfection you put in every detail of your apps, are beyond anything.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:25:24
So the timestamp is irrelevant?
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:56:58
not everybody understands the code. and it is still online.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:25:19
And the bad guys cant forge the timestamp?
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:33:14
The ₿ is reversed. Someone please fix it
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:09:15
They will release a new version soon. Let's hope it will support this feature.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:07:57
This makes me sad :( jesus, he is heartbroken :(
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:58:33
this guy is smart as fuck. he is the real satoshi but convinced the world he is not so he would attend every bitcoin meet in peace. amazing.
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:23:35
What app is that? Why the receiver name appear on the top?
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:02:49
So, wait until May and then write an email to delete all my info?
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:55:17
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:41:29
why do ou say it is catalan?
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:36:08
actually, they do. if btc changed its block size, it could increasingly transform the bch into a meaningless coin.
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:04:17
Warren Mom
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:59:00
bread is the best
@_date: 2015-10-22 22:57:47
so, this means that EU exchanges won't tax bitcoin trading? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:54:46
What? Can you explain?
