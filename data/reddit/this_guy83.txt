Not if you were the sucker who bought in at the artificially inflated price and spent the next 6 years waiting to break even.

From a pedantic person, you are impressively so. You didn't assume an age group, you assumed a level of technical skill. The respondent simply highlighted the age cohort least likely to have the technical skills you assumed. Ever perused Most of the posters there would greatly benefit from your comical lesson example.

That isn't unrealistic at all.

The first part of what you said 


seems to negate the second thing you said 


So what you're telling me, is that literally asking the internet (by Googling) how to buy the internet currency is not a good way to go about finding out how to buy the internet currency? I think that might be Bitcoin's biggest problem.

Having a background in financial economics makes me very interested in BTC but lacking the technical knowledge makes me very hesitant.  I have some bits on the BitPay app and I am not sure if this post is telling me I need to do something or if it's confirming that I'm good.

So? You don't find any value in knowing what your enemies want you to think about something? Or thinking about why they would want you think that? Take the source with a grain of salt, sure, but even propaganda has contextual value to a critical thinker.

He didn't say he's not accepting it; he didn't respond to Charlie's tweet. His tweet of "Not true..." was in reference to someone saying he was Satoshi.

And you lost me. The point of stealth wealth is that people don't know what you're really worth. It doesn't matter if they know the real source or some BS story. Don't let people know what you're worth.

Except for the part where we know [this BTC belongs to Mark Hanna, esq. of Brooklyn, NY.](  As a divorce lawyer he's probably not keen on being publicly associated with something that's supposed to be an anonymous asset.

If you're comfortable committing tax fraud because you don't think you'll get caught then go for it. Just keep in mind that there's no statute of limitations on tax fraud.

I see no reason for the smallest unit of one currency to equate to the smallest unit of another. Why do you think we won't get to a point where 1 USD = 1 Satoshi?

They should list both separately so that people can actually discern between the two sides and choose freely.

Because BTC is considered an asset and not a currency there are legally two transactions that happen when you buy in BTC, you sell BTC for the current market rate and then use those dollars to buy goods/services.  If BTC is worth more when you spend it than it was when you bought it, that appreciation is a taxable gain - even if dollars are never actually involved.

No one's saying the government should have stepped in and stopped him from making a monumentally stupid decision. Only that the decision he made was monumentally stupid.
