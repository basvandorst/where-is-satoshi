I am glad to see this point at the top of the discussion, as the major powers of the world have consistently and are currently using their almost limitless military powers to affect entire regions of the world, ruining the lives of innocent people for profit, maintenance of power, and the establishment of control over the flow of money/resources.

Has anyone been able to get their bank to do a wire transfer to them?  My bank won't allow transfers to their address.  
They wouldn't allow them to Coinbase either, for what it's worth.  But I could buy BTC with credit or a checking account on Coinbase.  I cannot do so with the US Bitflyer site.

Firstly, this is an awesome discussion.  Thank you all for engaging.
Secondly, it got me thinking about the nature of the US dollar and how it is controlled by private individuals with private interests.  There is too much incentive to manipulate it.  How can this be acceptable as a currency design?  It is far too centralized.
Thirdly, and I realize that  I am over simplifying but fiat (US$) was created as a currency based on the potential and actual wealth of the US (similar to Rome with the conquering, debt, etc).  Why is it assumed that there is an unlimited resource here?  Our seemingly endless progress and wealth are entirely dependent on very limited resources (namely fossil fuels).  Isn't the currency and the economy tied to the US also then, limited and deflationary?

I think it's more accurately an oligarchy with structures established to maintain a minimum amount of satisfaction with the status quo; e.g. social security, social welfare programs, medicare, etc.
The U.S. is a mixed economy but it is increasingly ruled by those with the financial means to influence policy, especially the banking institutions.  They socialize our policy to benefit their financial goals, protect their financial interests, and prevent their imprisonment or removal from power by influencing the highest offices of our government.

A good quotation:


a substitution of e-money for cash would lead to a corresponding decline in central bank asset holdings, and the interest earned on these assets that constitutes central bank [seigniorage]( revenue. 
… even a moderate loss of seigniorage could be of concern to some governments, particularly in countries with large budget deficits.”

It sounds like Bitcoin is the dream-currency of Libertarians.  It's too bad Ron Paul didn't ditch the 'gold standard' and praise bitcoin.  He might not have been so easily tossed to the wayside.
Here is a section from the pdf about the major factors that make **bitcoin** a major challenge for central banking institutions:






















any  virtual  central  bank,  but  rather  evolves  based  on  interested  users  performing a specific activity. … the scheme has been specifically designed in such a way that the  money supply will develop at a predictable pace.” … “The fact that the supply of money is clearly determined implies that, in theory, the issuance of money cannot  be altered by any central authority wanting to “print” extra money.”
