That was an off the cuff remark from Pol. Col. Rutphong Sanwanangkun who is an **immigration** superintendent. The immigration department has no jurisdiction over work permits or labor. Col. Sanwanankun has **no say** in whether or not you can work.
I'll leave it to you to read the Act and determine which department can prosecute you, but I will warn you that what you are doing is extremely foolhardy.

Use it to advertise for illegal work while in Thailand. I thought it was pretty obvious.

If you search around you will discover that savvy e-consumers will recommend paying by credit card through PayPal. This is because you then have 2 layers of protection. First from PayPal and if they don't play ball you have credit card chargeback to fall back on.
This demonstrates that consumers seek more protection, not less.

You are working illegally in Thailand if you don't have a work permit. You are being investigated. You're welcome.

You might want to rein your buddies in a little. Defamation law in Thailand is extremely draconian and a criminal offense. Calling their (military junta) government "evil" and "nazi" in support of you may attract heat.


err, no. Read the Act. Seek legal advice.


You can now add Thailand at the top of your list

You and the author of the article misquoted Basu. He said it's not a **deliberate** Ponzi scheme.

There's something wrong with your product if you need to spam people to buy into it. You are a bagholder in a pyramid scheme.

The linked page states your location as Thailand. Do you have a work permit and are you registered as a company in Thailand?
@_date: 2014-11-18 12:35:48
That's exactly how it works, pal. The Thai government has very strict regulation concerning performing any kind of work while a guest in their country. As I am sure you are very well aware. You have confirmed you are working. Guess where my wife works.

In its current form, Bitcoin impact on e-commerce payments will remain minimal.
This is due to no consumer protection as offered by credit cards, paypal and other methods.
Proof of this is the uptake of paypal in Australia on australian ebay.
Australia's banks offer relatively fast, simple and completely free wire transfer between australian banks. Wire transfer offers almost no consumer protection and it is virtually impossible to get your money back if something goes wrong.
Australian ebayers now overwhelmingly use paypal. The costs are paid by the merchants and passed onto the consumer in item prices. In the early days (up to around 2005) wire transfer was the overwhelming payment method. PayPal was almost unheard of.
Part of paypal's success in AU was due to "scare marketing" by ebay and PayPal, and a smaller part due to scammers, bad merchants etc.
It is highly unlikely that consumers will give up these protections now that they are broadly established and understood.
So in this regard, and in its current guise Bitcoin will fail completely except in a small number of niche markets.
