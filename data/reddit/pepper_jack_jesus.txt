I have been following BTC since 2011, shortly after poker black friday, and i was interesteed in funding my poker addiction.  I didn't buy bedause I was smart enough not to give Mt Gox my social security number.  In hindsite which I did, because my first thought was how cool it was and was going to buy several thousand dollars worth when it was really cheap (I assumed correctly then that it would either  e worth nothing as a novelty in niche ciclea, or a lot if globally adopted as it has - largely beause i have an educatioal background in compputer science as well a finance with an interest in cryptography).  However   I have owned bitcoin since March 2013 and currehtly hold a multi million worth in USD.  Owning BTC, BCH and dabling in aolt coins like ltc for the first year or so.
Also, worked for companies that weren't shitholes who would have rolle back changes by now instead of going dark for 48 hours.  Because that is what professionals do.

See we get that.  I get that.  You don't have to explain it.  BUT it also means that the software can be hard to patch and update, especially if there is an emergency need to do so.  It's a double-edge sword.  And in case you aren't aware, in the fifty-some-year history of modern computing ... the latter scenario (a bad actor taking advantage of a discovered vulnerability) is far far far more common than the former (a bad actor intentionally pushing out a vulnerability to be exploited).  
So have you ever considered that they DO GET IT.  And maybe you're the one who is either willfully ignoring or just negligently ignorant of other risks, which is why his opinion that BTC wasn't all bulletproof cheery and sunshine might be just as valid, if not more so, than yours?

The same way they know when you get paid at work, or sell a stock with a broker.  Crypto exchanges are being made to report.
You could sell under the table to people paying cash.  Even offer them a discount of 0-28% under market value to sweeten the deal for them, and account for taxes you don't have to pay in gains.  
But then you risk running into the IRS if they catch you, and also KYC and other money laundering laws.  Might be fine for a few thousand spread out over a year or so.  But good luck laundering hundreds of thousands or a million or more.  Just in terms of findig people to do that volume, and risk going to prison.

@_date: 2017-12-30 22:39:43
[Depends on age and filing status](
Technically ALL income has to be reported.  But the IRS isn't going to pursue shit that doesn't justify the time spent for an auditor to do so.  When I was in B-School, the rule I heard was it had to justify $150/hour of an auditor's time.  
In other words, if its unreported to the IRS (e.g. under the table strictly cash) you can probably get away with a lot ... but basically you are money laundering and evading taxes, and will go to prison if caught.  A few thousand even up to maybe in the lower tens of thousands... probably get away with it.  But still very illegal and a good way to go to prison.
If it is reported to the IRS, you run a good a chance of it getting flagged and having to face an audit.
Few hundred to a few thousand?  If it's reported, they will probably send you a letter saying their records and your return don't jive.  And you need to justify or pay.  (This happened to me on cashing out government bonds I had since I was an infant as gifts.  My dad always declared the interest on my early returns as unrecognized gains.. so I didn't have to report the capital gains in full when I cashed them.  But the IRS only saw that I cashed out $15,000 in bonds, not that I declared few hundred or so every year for the preceeding 20 years.  This happened on three different years that I cashed out a sizeable portion of bonds I was given since I was borm till I was in my 20s.  Once I called them, and explained how the gains had been reported over the preceeding years, I was golden and didn't have to pay as I already had.).

You know, having to figure out taxes on your multi million dollar windfall is really not a bad problem to have though.
To answer your question if you bought btc for $1 and its now worth $20,000.  and you buy a car valued at $20,000 with that one bitcoin.  You have to pay taxes on the capital gain of $19,999.
Capital gains, even when realized in a trade, are still a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:58:23
In the US, over 425k LT capitak gains get taxed at 20%, not 15% below that (500k in 2018).  If you are selling $900k in BTC you will save about 20k in taxes by selling 400k tomorrow and 500k on monday.  20k is almost like real money.
Also, over 200k adds an additional 3.8% medicare tax.  If you're at 400k you are better off splitting over two years.

Well my 15M example is bad.  But for me at the 1-2M range, splitting it over two or three years allows me to take 15% capital gains each year instead of 20%.  
cashing out 1M in capital gains next year means 15% on te first 500k and 20% on the second.  If i split it over two years, I save about 25k.  Which is about a new car.

@_date: 2017-12-30 22:08:35
yea but a lot of long term holders (me) will be at 15% and will probably split over two years to avoid moving into 20% territory (like me again).   
Problem is that it alzo fucks with your AGI.  So taking 500k out and paying 15% taxes (next year single filer) puta me into a 37% tax bracket.  Which if I am making 50-100k a year, I am better off just taking the year off since nearly 40% of my income from work goes to the government.  And even if most deductions are now gone, i still wouldnt have near enough deductions to push me into the much lower tax brackers I am usually in by writing off damn near every expense I have.
I've chosen to only sell about 200k this year.  Also avoids the 3.8 medicare tax.  And I may move to a zero-tax state next year just so I can avoid my high state taxes to offset the 20% capital gains over 500k.  Then dump all at once.  Take the year off to write the great american western in Wyoming or South Dakota.. or NV.
Also I am hoping it goes back up to 18k, so I can cash out for more.  I'd still be a mllionaire after taxes if i cashed out in full now ... but i'd rather have 1.6 million after taxes if I wait out this bullshit and we get another rally.

If it makes you feel any better, I bought just hours (like three hours) before it dropped nearly 50%.  This is when it peaked at about $250, and crashed down to like 140 (a low of $50 at one point).  That was April 7, 2013.  It didn't recover until Nov of that year, then crashed again.  It wasn't till Oct 2015 that it stayed at or above that price.  I've held the entire time.  
I will sell when I can easily clear $1M. which is coming closer.  I hope that happens.  But had I just waited those three or four hours, I'd be well over $1M on that buy.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:26:59
This is a nice attempt at a strawman.  You didn't say pay your tax, you gave a specific inaccurate amount.  And you didn't even include all the appropriate taxes.  You're failing to address other taxes like state and the affordable care tax.   So you are giving even more inaccurate advice.  
And again to my point, you are giving advice that someone whose never played at the level we're playing at might suggest.  (Hence my snarky proletariat comment).  
What OP is asking, or should be seeking, is what are (cough) creative, yet legal, ways to minimize these taxes.  For example.  Just by setting up a trust in a different state one can avoid paying state income tax.  In my state that's 5%.  If it were a $100,000 investment, $5,000 tax savings is nice but probably not worthwhile.  For $1,500,000 that is a $75,000 savings.  
That is almost like real money.
And you know what?  You can do it without ever having to move.  Google: Personal Tax Inversion.
That's the type of shit people do when they are playing at this level.  While you give advice to "just pay your taxes" and give wrong amounts that would put them in prison, they seek strategies that minimize their tax liabilities while still being legal.
Now ... STFU.

Uh Apple was all  but dead in the early 90s until it found a niche market segment for the Macintosh.  It was never considered "best" except to the fanboys and girls who found a little market producing flyiers and other marketing materials.  Most people who cut their teeth on the Apple or C64 and others (and  by most i mean pretty much all) went to the PC because that became the business standard, and had the wealth of software available  to it.   
Thinking Apple was best of breed in 1999 is just demonstrating complete ignorance of the tech market at that time.

Wow dude.  I feel your pain.   United States?
If I cash out all at once at, say, $1M, that an additional $50,000 in taxes because the capital gains rises to 20% after about $400k in your AGI.  And $50,000 is almost like real fucking money.  Like new car money.  And not a Ford Fiesta either.   And if you don't cash out, and take the tax hit, bitcoin could crash lower than if you were to have just sold and taken the tax hit.   And the cash basis for the initial purchase is almost negligable, so I don't get much of a reduction there.  
And you know the worst part is, even if i took the max out minus my salary to stay in the 15% capital gains, it bumps my AGI to the max and I am now paying tax on my other income at 35% instead of 25%.  So basically every two weeks that I work, one more day is to the government.
I'd really like to know what some of my options are.  One of the nice thigns about BTC and buying it a while ago, is that it's not really on the books anywhere.  I will be looking at off shore tax havens this week, which may be a viable option.  
Hit me up in PM what you find out, if there's more of us in the same position we can probably bounce ideas off each other over then next couple weeks before the end of the year.  
I am torn between selling $300k or so this year and some more in Jan, or selling it all and taking the hit, or just sell some amount to pay for some things, and just hold to see if it doubles again next year.  An off short corp would also be pretty fucking cool to, as long as what I am doing is legit by U.S. law (I dont wanna go to pound me in the ass prison)

Stop thinking about the price per coin and saying it's too high.  Look at he money supply compared to the rest of the financial industry worldwide.
Money supply is only 155 billion.  That's one sixth that of just one company, Apple. It is just 50% more than the richest person in the world we know of (Bezos at 100B).  It is 1/16 that of just one precious metal (gold).
And BTC has only really two competitors.  Eth and BCH.  While BCH can be debated, at least ETH has some real useful properties to it.   And those two are a fraction of the adoption of BTC.  
So one financial instrument dominates the market that it is in.  It is still dwarfed in comparison to other established currencies, metals, and equities. And BTC is slowly becoming accepted by the mainstream financial sector.
So stop saying it is madness, or that it's madness it is going up so fast.   Maybe it's madnes that it is still so low.

@_date: 2017-11-26 08:43:32
At somepoint it will stop and correct.  Yes. But once the market realizes what the true value is, it will automatically adjust to that point.  It will happen quick.  
In the grand scheme of things, bitcoin is still only worth 1/19,000 of all coins, banknotes, and deposit accounts in the entire world.  As a global currency and store of value that has no government bounds and can be traded near instantaneously anywhere inthe world ... it may still be undervalued.  I can still realistically see it going to a money supply in USD to 300-500k in the very near future.

Yeah, I don't mind the idea that there are people out there buying into BTC who have the wherewithal to invest in speculative investments, such as the middle-class and upwards, and being able to personally profit off of them as the price goes up.  
But these people are poor.  Dirt poor.  And there are many more of them than there are wealthy people.  $200 to them is substantially more valuable than $200 to myself and the people around me.  Their demand drives up the price, and when I sell out (which I will be doing sometime soon I believe), I do not feel comfortable knowing it was their money that I am taking.  People who didn't know better.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:31:33
If it only ever remained as strictly something to exchange for goods and services, pizza would still cost 10k bitcoins.  Due to its scarcity however, and excessive demand, the price is rising.   This was bound to happen.  It had to happen.  Otherwise it would have only ever been a niche curiosity among a few people in the cryptography scene.  And yes, some people are exploiting the massive deflation right now.   But that happens with any financial instrument when people believe something is undervalued.
That question is if it is still undervalued and where it might eventually level off where the prices are stabilized (at least compared to other stores of value like gold or other currencies)

I will use simple figures for you to understand.  
I create new money called ShitCoin, and it consists of the 100 pairs of soiled underwear laying on my bedroom floor (I don't wash my clothes a lot).  I give them away to 100 people.  One person comes along and buys one ShitCoin from one holder for $1.  Money supply of all ShitCoin is $100.   DummyDumDum comes in with a $100 bill from his $10,000 stash, and wants to buy ShitCoin.  For some reason that economists and people of good taste everywhere do not understand, nobody wants to sell for $1 or $2 or $5 or even $10.  Two people finally decide $50 is their selling point.  
Is the value of the money supply of ShitCoin now $101?  No.  It is now $5,000.
Now suppose that DummyDumDum has an epiphany and comes in with a $10 bill and half of all ShitCoin holders suddenly realize they are holding shit and decide to sell for whatever they can get.  So 50 people sell their ShitCoin for $0.20 each.  Is the value of the money supply now $11?  No, it is $20.
In other words, the money supply of ShitCoin is not strictly determined by how much money flows into the system, but also on the willingness of the people who own it to sell at varying prices.  This makes OPs thumbnail calculations laughably simple and almost certainly incorrect when they don't account for it.
Worse yet, a net 53 people actually voted that stupid shit up.  And you are defending it.
Also, the point of the pizza analogy wasn't to make an analogy of the reason OP is wrong, it was to demonstrate a basic lack of understanding of what they are talking a bout.  This is the type of shit taught in the first week of economics, like the area of a circle is taught in the first week of geometry. 
Finally, no this isnt the 1% fallacy. 
Did you actually say something so stupid that I would explain it in clear terms?  Please tell me this is the case.  If so,  brilliant.  If not, I fear that you and your money will soon be parted.
Edit: changes.  I'm done correcting myself though.

It is so painfully obvious that at least 33% of the people here have no fucking concept of anything that has to do with proper finance and investing, and they are probably all about 16-25 years old or all of their experience and retirement savings is based on having a 401k at work or a pension.
In the U.S. there's been six or seven dips, corrections, and crashes since 2000.  That's about one every two years or so.  And I've been in BTC for about five years just holding steady, and have seen about twelve significant dips.  At least.  
These people really need to get out and put their money into some treasuries or other AAA bands if they can't handle this volatility or need a pat on the back for not panic selling.  I'm not sure they even have a conception that BTC and all cryptos are still extremely speculative investments (or even what that term of art means).
And the sad thing?  THere will probably be some idiot who makes some smart-ass comment to me for flaunting that I have more knowledge in this area.  And they'll say something like, "gee tell us more know-it-all".  Just go read a fucking book on the subject and you'd all realize just how volatile this shit is.  If you can't handle that kind of risk you need to GTFO before you and your money is soon parted.

No you just believe what you want to believe.   Every single bit of evidence that demonstrates there are racial differences in IQ, you will completely ignore or try to find other reasons than the one you're not comfortable with accepting. 
It's called confirmation bias.  
The reason every black dominated civilization on the planet is a total shit hole (even the ones that were once ruled by the whites and the blacks now rule that have turned to shit) isn't because of DUH SOSSEYOH EKHONOMEEKS.  It's because they can't as a group grow and maintain an advance civilization like whites and asians have done.  As a population, they simply are unable to cooperate in mass, educate themselves, and develop and use technologies. 
The opposite is true for groups like Asians and Jews, who score higher on IQ tests and have done pretty well for themselves.  Go fucking figure.

No I just described what happens with supply and demand.  Nothing in what I said in the previous statement had anything to do with speculation.  It's like first week economics.  If supply is limited and demand is high, price goes up.  
Holy shit have you ever taken a course in economics?


Yes gold does go up and down.  Golf clap to pointing out the obvious.  So does the USD compared to other currencies.  Both are, for all intents and purposes, more stable that BTC. 
By stabilize I mean it doesn't fluctuate 10% a day for a weeks at a time.  


No.  That is not what I meant by stabilize.  Stabilize in the sense that it doesn't fluctuate by 50, 100, 500 percent over the course of weeks or months, every other month.  


False.  If they are buying it as an investment, speculative as it is, Then they believe it is still due to rise in price.  Whether they are aware of it or not, they are buying because they still believe it is undervalued.  Even if they don't know how to word it correctly.

Interesting difference in perspectives I suppose.  I don't think small like the common person who is happy to earn $50,000 a year, and struggle to get by day to day.  I guess to them $175,000 is huge.  And I guess it is a fucking fortune to someone living in an impoverished nation.
But I hate to hurt your feelings, if you think $175,000 is huge, then you are thinking small.  Huge is at least a million or more.  At least.
And in context of this discussion, $175,000 is no where near a "high net worth" person that would be targeted for luxury goods and services.  Especially in the U.S.  That puts you slightly above "affluent".  SLIGHTLY above it.

Yes but they don't give you a discount because you have money (like the "21 bitcoin club discount").  They give a discount when you actually spend it.
Parent commenter is correct.  The idea of a "21 BTC Club" that gives discounts to people who have $175,000 worth of BTC is pretty laughable.  This sub must be infiltrated with really poor people if you think that net worth is something corporations providing luxury goods and services would target.

Hate the idea that they may buy in now thinking it will double or triple, and instead they lose half or 3/4 of their money.  
These people are poor.  BTC is extremely risky and volatile.  I do not want to see them hurt in the long run.

Except I do.  Scientists who even suggest racial differences will have their careers destroyed.  Again, James Watson is a prime example.  


HAHAHA Oh boy.  You've lost this.  Give it up.  You're just shouting out insults now.  You stopped trying to defend your position with evidence or arguments.  It's just a mess of insults.  
Yeah, there are difference in IQ and behavior observable between race or ethnicity (whatever you want to call it).  Just like there are differences for many other traits.  This is easily observable throughout the world through many different statistics.  It's just too taboo for some to accept.

Because **"can't easily"** is not the same thing as **"can't"** alone.  I know you are new here (because you seem to think what I said is the dumbest thing you ever read on the sub), but comparing the financial instrument BTC  to a share in stock is pretty fucking common around these parts. That's especially true because most of these idiots don't know why calling the money supply of BTC in USD as "market capitalization" makes them look ignorant about what they speak.
In comparison, I **"can't easily"** make sweet sweet love to your sister under the summer moon, but that doesn't mean I **"can't"**.   Because all I need is to be the first man to ever treat her nice and tell her she looks pretty, which would be pretty hard on any man's stomach to do.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:22:29
Ignorant posts like this remind me of why we are in a bubble now.  
It could go up to a trillion dollar money supply in a few years due to widespread adoption.  Or it could go back down to a few  billion if major governments outlaw it, and it's widely just an underground currency.  And there's a  billion other risk that could make BTC be nearly worthless in years or even weeks and days.
Apple would  be shit today if it wasnt for Jobs vision for the iPod-&gt;iPhone.  Amazon successfully invested into many areas and revenue streams.  
But you cherry pick the winners, and ignore the losers.  Where's Pets.com and Zombo.com.  Both were poised to be huge players in the Internet space.  You could do anything at Zombo.com ... ANYTHING.

What answer do you want?  


I need to know the specific fact pattern to answer this.  Get caught doing what?  That answer has as many possible answers as the tens of thousands of legal actions ever gone before the courts.
Penalties range from having to pay more than they would have if they reported correctly, to going to prison.  Depends on what they did.  Which you failed to provide a fact pattern for.
And no, I am not a tax acountant or lawyer, so I won't research anythig you present and give you an opinion.  
My point originaly was that you weren't even aware that taxes on a million in capital gains is not 15%.  So if you don't know that, why are you giving advice?

Yeah well Five Guys is better than McDonalds as far as I'm concerned, but in the world of business they are a competitor in much the same sense that your local college football team that you root for is a competitor to the Philadelphia Eagles.
Bitcoin has a HUGE advantage over the smaller alt-coins in terms of adoption and acceptance, even if they others may have advantages over them.

You're right, I lied.  It's $672,000-ish, plus whatever I can extract as bitcoin cash or whatever that abortion is worth.  I think an additional $40,000.  
Because it is so hard to believe that I bought a bunch of BTC a few years ago and it's now increased in value by A LOT.
And who gives a shit if I broadcast it.  You don't know me.  You're not going to know me.  And "that amount of money" is not a lot in the grand scheme of things.
