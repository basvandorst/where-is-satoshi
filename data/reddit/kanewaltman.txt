If only more people who needed to adopt this sort of technology had android.
I'm a sheep myself with an iPhone and that looks great!

Did I just read this right?
"The first BitcoinATMs will be launched in San Diego and Cyprus next week."
@_date: 2013-05-18 11:05:51
I'm just gonna say it. I'd go.

Depends on where in Europe. I'm in Finland

Damn I was hoping for a conference so I could go educate people. 
Saw the code on the website. Only gets you 1% off. Pssshh
@_date: 2013-05-18 11:22:16
Is there a site that shows what companies are public and allow you to purchase shares in BTC? 
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:12:30
But within like a week?!

Who steps in? And in the nature of thumb sucking, what if someday there's no one to step in??

It's either the masses of people panicking or it could be the government plotting.
The plotting sounds more fun.
It's plotting.

Graphic designer here. Bravo. 
This is not easily done, especially at this quality. Bookmarked.

Don't take my word for it. But here are the easiest steps. 
If you're good at day-trading and have experience, try it out. In a second I'll tell you how. If not, stop reading when I say.
So you've got this money in a bank. If you dont, put it in a bank. Next, open a bitstamp.net account. This takes seconds and is really easy. Deposit the 1,000e into bitstamp. Go to deposit, do it with SEPA (eu bank transfer standard) and in the form, type the amount and proceed. They'll give you all the information you need to take to your bank. 
Now depending on who you bank with you might be able to do this part online, here in Finland my Nordea bank let me do it with online banking. You'll be transferring money from your bank to one in Slovenia. I know this all sounds weird, but with now two successful transactions over the past 4 days, don't be worried. With all of Bitstamps bank info and the transaction number needed walk into your bank and tell them you're transferring to another bank. After the transfer, mine took 1.5 days (especially good for a bitcoin purchase) you'll have USD in your bitstamp account. (they exchange it for free)
Now, you have the USD. Buy the Bitcoins! Do this with the buy/sell feature. If you are a financially savvy person. Watch the markets and buy at a low. If you're not you're just gonna want to buy them and let them sit for a few weeks/months. I do not suggest leaving the BTC in the BitStamp account. Although I see them as being secure, with instawallet getting hacked, I don't trust anyone. Find another resource on on how to best secure a wallet. Transfer the BTC from BitStamp to a secure wallet.
When they're in the secure wallet. Leave them. Forget about them for a while, and keep tracking the value of BTC. When you've calculated the profit, move them back to BitStamp and reverse the whole process back to your account. 
Now if you want to day trade because you know how, or can afford to lose cash keep reading. If not, stop. 
You can use an exchange like BTC-E or MtGox to hold your bitcoins instead of the secure wallet. When you have them in your exchange (BTC-E/MtGox) start watching the market movement. Buy low, sell high. With the large bitcoin fluctuation right now you could stand to make a lot of money, or lose it all. 
I personally suggest investing half the BTC into LTC through the BTC-E exchange. I think LTC will grow to be 25% of BTC's total value, where as they're currently $4.50 per coin. 
I hope any of this helps... Let me know if you've got more questions.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:22:34
I see one critical flaw. Isn't Instawallet just an online wallet? Not an exchange?
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:03:19
What does the date mean? 4.16
If like to attend haha
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:46:59
I'll be damned, some actual good conversation of litecoin in Someone pinch me!
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:27:15
You could take sole responsibility for the chargebacks, but you're also painting a big ass target on you for someone who'd want to steal everything you've got. Not a credit card company in the world will side with someone selling e-currencies. Chargebacks are just too prevalent, and dangerous. Don't do it.

I'd think someone could figure out how to monetize Bitcoin+NFC+PayPal. I mean, what about creating a physical cash register. Super sleek and minimal. Also accepts Bitcoin. All backed by PayPal and their ever controlling system. (That one's for free.)
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:19:07
Actually I meant can someone figure out what happens on this date. I perfectly understand the European changes and even edited to 4.16 for the large American demographic on reddit
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:24:36
The vast majority of regular people dont understand the fascination with computer wallets, e-money, ect. Physical denominations of currency make sense to them. Paper wallets are also hands down the safest way to store coins. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 15:33:03
Input cash, BTC equivilent gets sent to your account. That's about it... 
Does it work the other way? I have no idea.

I'm an American fin living in Helsinki. Is this good or bad?
I didn't see any taxation percentages, but typically the taxes here are extremely high, so I will be surprised if the percent is reasonable 
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:59:12
I'd love to see a floor plan! 
@_date: 2013-07-22 10:33:47
There was a pr statement from them about a month and a half ago from them announcing their plans for litecoin. I'm on my phone right now, if you can't find it just ask me and I'll look through r/litecoin. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:45:14
And moments like these truly rare too. I'm honored just to be able to watch cool thugs like this happen. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:57:03
This PR didn't really convey to me wether or not withdrawals in USD are once again automated or if they're still being done with this 'man-power'.
@_date: 2013-05-17 15:33:16
Will it spit cash back out for Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:46:59
As someone who's tried doing this, I can tell you this is the path of least resistance. Besides using bit-instant. As far as I can tell though, it doesn't work outside the US. Any other system without using a bank requires walking around with cash. I'm personally not in favor of walking around with 1,000e hot in the pocket. You'd also be wiring them through a 3rd party system with old technology. Something I'm also not fond of. 
"for example simply buying BTC at BTC-E at a low rate."
Connecting a bank in some way is the most reliable way to do this. Which was your initial request.

Do you have the knowledge on how to develop an exchange? If so, I have some big time investors trying to make one, they just need developers.

Well I'm a UI designer working on several BTC related projects aiming to better the community as a whole. How this fits into your conference plan I have no clue...

Can you elaborate on what this app would do exactly?

Well Finland is a massive hub for communication, IT, and design. If anyone's going to be adopting crypto-currencies first, it's going to be us. In fact our governments have officially stated that Bitcoins are legal, and the community as a whole is interested in them. Everyone here speaks english, so no communication barriers. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:15:10
There was one. I believe BitcoinsForBoston or something like that. The thing was it was advised not to launch because of the amount of people that try to benefit off of the crisis type situations. If we risked Bitcoin being associated with a cash run benefiting on such a tragic happening, thats very bad 'pub'.
