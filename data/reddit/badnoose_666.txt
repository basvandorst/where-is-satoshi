Hey Guys, I know a thing or two about the project. Lack of communication is a problem which is slowly being solved now. Besides what is on the web page ( there was a newsletter sent out to subscribers with some updates on the device.
Anodized aluminum enclosure Anodized aluminum enclosures were received and press fit tests were performed. The aluminium enclosure is pressed together using a 1000 Newton force. This is the same high force that would be required to open the enclosure, compared to ultrasonic welded cases that you could just tear apart. First of all, AsicVault devices are also potted. This means that the device is filled with a compound that will completely seal its contents and provide additional protection from shock and vibration and, most importantly, provides complete exclusion of moisture and other corrosive agents.
IP68+ Rating Wallets are designed to have a real IP68 rating. This is to assure you that we are testing our devices in lifelike situations as opposed to just dunking them in a glass of water. The IP68 rating means that AsicVault devices are completely dust tight and can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at up to 1.5 meters deep.
It will also support some big name coins that nobody else supports ATM.
Shipments are delayed due to the fact that the first batch is relatively small and the technology is complex- this means longer lead times and higher prices from vendors. 
LMK if You have any questions.
