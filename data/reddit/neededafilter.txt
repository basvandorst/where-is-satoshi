@_date: 2017-12-30 05:20:05
Exactly right.  Havent been in as long as you but for the past two years and always loved BTC even though im majority ETH holder.  The fact that people feel anyone complaining about the un-usability of the network is a troll is ridiculous.  There used to be entire businesses run on BTC and this arbitrary block size limit is killing peoples ability to earn a living.  They are forcing merchants to switch to shitty BCH or other coins, I guess its good for ETH though, so at least i got that going for me.

Forgive the most likely tired/stupid question... But when using the LN does everyone need to 1st commit an amount of BTC and lock it in a channel, losing their ability to use it otherwise?  Or can the coins stay in your own private wallet with no restrictions on how you send/use them?
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:42:39
By "everyone" i meant anyone wanting to use the LN.  And by your answer i infer that yes people do need to 1st commit a sum of BTC and it stays there inside an LN channel and can only be used within the LN correct?

Your analogy while i guess funny as you say; fails to make a connection in my mind to the DOA incident.
My view on the code is law mantra that was slammed in everyone's face in the wake of the DOA was that at the time nothing critical was running on the EVM, no businesses would have had their transaction reversed or money lost, no ICOs, no ENS auctions, no innocent bystanders would have been affected by a HF to rescue the DOA investors funds.  So pretty much the ONLY entity affected by the HF would have been the black hat.  So you have a unique situation where central action would have nothing but a net positive for everyone but the attacker, why not take action?  Also knowing that the EF laid out a multi step plan before starting the project, investors know the "final" step would be Serenity and we were only in Homestead the 2nd of the planned 4.  (ofcourse there will always be upgrades for as long as the network exists so Serenity wont be the end but my view while a laymans view remains).  I just dont see how these ideals are more important than a positive good with zero negative consequences.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:45:33
Absolutely we are all lucky, but you also gotta cover your bases just in case.  I feel the same way you do about BCH but for ETC, I keep a portion of that dogshit but will never buy and support the ecosystem.  For my BCH I will hold some but sell for other projects in bullruns like this until I get to a limit that I wont go under, just in case.

Seeing as though im from Montreal i hope to god my french education allows me to remember that brain buster :)  
So Ill take a wild stab in the dark and say you believe the bailout sets a precedent that will allow centralized actions from now to all of time.  "Well the DOA was bailed out so we will just HF again and again" resulting in ever moving goalposts.  Justified by the unsatisfiable as you put it, criteria that the platform will always be evolving and upgrading.
Im just an outsider here but my belief is that the raison d'etre of these platforms are for social utility, you're correct.  If that means using some centralized actions to get the training wheels off so to speak then i agree with it.  I also believe that the Parity funds should be released in the next update as well, call me crazy.

@_date: 2017-11-16 22:01:06
Hey, thanks for coming back and giving me an answer, I honestly wasn't expecting it :)
I cant say I can argue with your central point in that by allowing intervention when things go badly it removes the only benefit to a trustless platform.  Honestly not to split hairs but that is pretty much what i knew you were talking about when i said earlier you believed it sets a precedent for further intervention down the line if things go badly again. Though I will admit you articulated it much better than I.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:50:58
Actually im very interested in challenging my assumptions thus the reason why I am engaging in what i thought was a civil discussion with you... Its also the reason why i didnt invest in JUST Ethereum but BTC and a number of other projects.  I dont claim to know even half the answers but im always trying to learn.  Which can be a problem in this space because of attitudes like this last statement of yours.  Instead of just telling me i am incorrect why not explain simply why Im wrong?  
This whole "if you cant figure it out on your own Im not wasting time helping you" mentality is definitely a dark part of the crypto community and something that will hopefully change.  Try being decent.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:58:47
Absolutly agree with that point.  Alot of users in ethtrader call for the "death of BTC" and that rubs me wrong as well.  I own both and and loving the progression of both.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:15:30
I can understand where you and people with your viewpoint come from, and i admit i look at this situation with more of a "real world" type mentality.  Not saying I am right, just that seems you look at it as binary, no room for error type thing.  Maybe you are right and that by allowing even one single intervention it destroys the entire platform down the line but I just dont see it like that.  Only time will tell i guess.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:32:55
Lies.  They forked to save DOA investors money and literally ZERO people lost money besides the black hat.  No proof at all to your claims.  If there was it would spammed onto every sub.  Wtf is the point of technology if it comes 1st before the social benefit of humanity?  The whole code is law bullshit only holds water when the platform is completed and running with real stakes.  When the DOA happened that wasn't the case at ALL.
@_date: 2019-06-18 00:35:53
Do you consider "Quantative easing" a scary term?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:13:41
"I think ethereum is quite possibly one of the most harmful projects to the human race" - WOW... Ok well at least now i can see where you are coming from with your constant onslaught of accusations and hyperbole (to me anyway).  
We definitely want the same thing though so we can agree on that.  I dont get the evil/dishonest/two faced vibe at all from the people in the EF from the talks/interviews ive watched or the articles Ive read.  I think they care about the same things as us and they have the technical ability to build these tools (i hope so anyway).  I have heard the bankercoin/trojan horse conspiracy theory before but ironically its gotta be one of the few theories i give little weight to.  I say ironically because I definitely believe alot of conspiracy theories that most of the public get flat out upset with me for.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:27:00
I can't imagine that scenario at all, 10k then crash to 1k would kill any progress made doubt it would recover from that at this stage in the game.  Way too many coins with better tech.  Perhaps 10k correction back to 5k

@_date: 2017-11-28 03:35:27
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:35:29
OK so thats alot to digest, mostly ive read it before but last year.
-ETH foundation owned 900+k DAO tokens.  So someone from the EF (0x0037A6B811ffeB6e072DA21179d11B1406371C63) owned that but no one knows who... Who is to say it wasnt Charles Hoskinson who left the EF early or another member?  Is there any proof that it wasnt him or someone else no longer affiliated with the EF at the time of the hack?  (Apologies if that is a stupid question and easily verifiable but maybe you can shed some light there for me)
-The EF spammed Reddit.  The EF doesnt spam subs on reddit, i highly doubt that.  Just because some moonkids get a hard on for one coin they feel they can pump isnt in the control of any foundation.  Its happening with IOTA, WTC, and VTC right now actually.
-Investors lost money because they bought in at 20$ and the price crashed to 8$.  Well from memory the price was only 20$ for a couple hours i think and if some day traders bought in high and sold low they should be aware of the gamble they are taking.  Consenting adults and all that.  If they held they are very happy today wouldn't you agree?
-Code is law was invented by the EF.  If memory serves it was "unstoppable applications" i think but lets say thats splitting hairs, fine.  They also said the project will not be "complete" until Serenity and this happened only in Homestead.  I agree no platform is complete and none ever will be since improvements and upgrades will always be happening, but what i meant was this happened at a nascent stage of the platform with no real stakes involved.  Again no one was effected negatively but the exploiter.
In the end we will not come to terms since our beliefs do not align, you might think I am only taking this stance because i have an investment in ETH but i honestly believe if there is a way to fix a bad with a good that causes no collateral damage to ANYONE then i say fuck it, do it.  Another individual with your point of view stated it in a way that i will admit is very fitting for your side of the argument in that by intervening when things go bad you are essentially removing the one thing Ethereum sets out to do in the first place thus removing its utility all together and thats executing code no matter what objectively.  Has a nice sound to it.

Seems like this field is one of the more popular spaces for crypto applications.  Makes sense since the on/off ramp fiat to crypto is always on everyones mind.

TenX ive seen actually youtube videos of people actually withdrawing Euros so seems they are legit, Monaco I don't trust too much because of their marketing tactics.

@_date: 2017-10-12 22:01:39
I'm sure there are pro btc ppl in geico they are popping up more and more as we take these steps into mainstream spotlight. I was just thinking in this particular case geico gave vice some money to be the sponsor or their series "Outliers" and so they have their name before each episode.  But yes I'm sure some rep from geico had a look at the synopsis for each episode and could have withdrawn the sponsorship and chose not to so that counts for something.

Thank you for the write up, I appreciate you taking the time.  I will start by saying before your post I had zero respect for the etc community since I was around during that whole DAO fiasco but was not an investor in it myself I just held my eth on the sidelines and always thought that the hardfork was the right decision.  I definitely believe etc was started by btc members as a way to undermine eth, however seems like it is becoming more than that now.  I just wish they would lose the name and stand on their own two legs to gain some credibility.  
Your points are troubling for sure and just so I'm clear; all the DAO investors on the eth chain were refunded in full, but some of the DAO investors on the etc chain who had their etc reclaimed by the white hat group were never refunded?  In the first link the blog post said everyone was given a window to claim their tokens and anything left after was then locked up for a period of time again, is that correct?  If investors are being locked out of their funds that is definitely wrong...
