Thank for this was very informative! I was surprised all these posts were! Could you explain the developement team to me a bit?
Can anyone devlope code for bitcoin? 
Do they change code within the actual bitcoin? Or it just making something that you can use with bitcoin if you choose to?
And who decides what's good and bad can I vote somewhere or is voting for miners?
One more thing so is a hard fork when they make a new coin such as bitcoin cash? So like bitcoin cash did a hard fork because they thought they could make a better coin
And a soft fork when they someone makes something for bitcoin you can choose to use or not?
Thank you so much for helping me understand a bit more!
