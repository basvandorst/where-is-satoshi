well back when bitcoin cash was created and after that, btc transactions were extremely clogged and they wanted to have a short term solution. They would be forcing the miners to have more storage, at the benefit of more throughput. It was not a bad or stupid idea, but unfortunately bitcoin cash became a sore loser group quite quickly when people did not support their upgrade.

Do those even make money? If you know about bitcoin, I would think you are savvy enough to use coinbase?

First point true, for now 
Yea but that wouldn’t stop them from bringing as much back as they can

Why is the link not on the main keepkey website and why is the normal price 50$ on amazon but on sale for 22$

Still a 1% fee for bitcoin and you also have to pay fees to turn your original fiat into bitcoin anyway. I wouldnt spend bitcoin for gold when i can use cash and pay less.

why not put a real candle stick pattern? This candle stick pattern doesn't make sense

can you keep this trash out of here

Right now that’s pretty much how it is, but that won’t be an issue in the long term

You have to sell it for 1 million first. Robinhood doesn’t fork over anything. If you can’t sell it for 1 million then you don’t get 1 million. If you can sell it, then someone else NOT robinhood bought it

I would imagine tech would prevent the loss of all coins eventually, even if it does not make sense in the current model

As someone who is new to bitcoin, the price rising to 4k is what gave me confidence to take it seriously. I do believe confidence will rise as the price rises because there are people with the same mindset as me.

This is truly awesome, nice costumes guys

10% is fair for their business model. They take risk and put out a lot of capital to make and place the machines, risk should be rewarded. The people who own these machines are pioneers in a new industry and it is not easy to turn a profit. If it was easy, the fees would come down. If you want cheaper fees, increase adoption
