Are you going to deny the moon landing as well? BTC is about a perfect example of a bubble as you can get
As for your claim that it has intrinsic value... it does not, most currency already has very little intrinsic value, a digital currency has even less. Its value is entirely based on what people think it is worth.
If you don't think it is a bubble then go look what happened after todays senate hearing... it's a bubble.

Except the FAQ and myths does not address the problems, it just says nope it isn't true. The biggest problem BTC has is the wet dream libertarians have about it and the complete lack of understanding of monetary policy that comes with them.
For example, we have this


This simply is not true. There is nothing stopping a big corporation from taking control of BTC mining, all of a sudden you have one entity control the supply.
The entire section in inflation (and many other sections) love to point out that the government has no control so they cannot inflate or deflate the currency.... but this is not a good thing. You just have to look at the 19th century in America to see why the central banking system came to be.
The selling point so many lovers of BTC try and use is the fact that no one has control over BTC, the problem though is this is the weakest aspect of BTC and why it will never become a mainstream currency. Currency needs stability, you do not get stability simply by changing how the currency is made.
On the supply of BTC, again it is often a big selling point. Again it is a problem when it comes to using it as a mainstream currency. By having a set amount of supply you do add predictability to the supply.... the problem is as we have seen the financial world is not at all predictable. By having a system that cannot change you cannot make adjustments as needed.
