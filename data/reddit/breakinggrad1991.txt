Because KYC is coming if your company is registered or operates in any jurisdictions outside some nations like malta.
He's doing it so his company doesn't get targeted. It sucks, but I honestly don't know why everyone is so personally angry at him.
Annoyed to lose an anonymous service? Yes.
Hate the guy personally? You lost me.

Probably not the answer you want, but it entirely depends on your country and the platform you're using.
In the UK we allow trading crypto without full kyc, but the company i work for requires it anyways as regulation is coming for crypto to crypto. Notably, KYC for everyone allows platforms to have increased deposit, withdrawal, and purchase limits, as well as being (in general) safer to use for the general public.

If you're in the UK, XCH4NGE is launching soon i think. Local bitcoins minus the scams, good customer support, 30 minute max transaction time limit, etc.
If half of the stuff theyre saying is in the works is real, then they're ones to keep your eye on.

To clarify, I don't for a second doubt more men hold bitcoin and that its lack of user friendly UI is no doubt a large part of that.
It was the "women just want to shop" aspect of it that raised my eyebrow.

Wild generalisations.

I mean, if you're a buyer you end up sending your details to complete strangers every time you buy. At least a registered, regulated business has a duty of care for their customers

Most people ask for ID, especially the first time you buy from them. If you buy from different people, you're sending your info out to a lot of people who don't have any compulsion to keep your data secure. It's also entirely pointless, because I assume 1% or less of sellers on LocalBitcoins are actually trained to detect fake IDs.
Poor KYC checks are why people are more likely to have their bank accounts closed with localbitcoins transactions than exchanges and brokerages- there are no measures to prevent someone from sending you stolen or dirty money, or using a stolen identity.
Personally I feel more comfortable with one company holding my info than a bunch of random crypto users.
Sorry for the late reply!

Thanks! There's so much to love about crypto, but I've never understood the whole "freely hand out my information to randomers, just not to companies with the infrastructure to protect it" thing.
I get that banks, government/regulatory overreach, etc are bad, but some processes are necessary evils.
