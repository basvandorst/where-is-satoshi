Well not really, they are a HD wallet. I think they're encrypting the wallet on their side, but you ultimately have your own private keys. They're not a custodial wallet like Coinbase, Xapo and Circle.

Yes, they rely on email addresses I think, and they have an internal system for sending bitcoin between Circle users, and that is actually a huge problem IMO. We need open protocol(s) for handling this, somehow, not centralized via incompatible bitcoin banks.

Maybe [Gopher](
@_date: 2016-08-31 21:24:50


Of course not.


You know very well why they're claiming to speak for Bitcoin's creator. _They want to increase the block size limit_. Hard fork progression has been in a stalemate position for far too long without a clear resolution, this really worries people, whether you realize it or not. 
While I do hope Lightning Network will work and succeed, I think it's just as important to scale on-chain regardless of SegWit's block size increase.
Bitcoin Core's uncertainty about hard-forking has created these counter-parties that we're now seeing.
Also, you seem hostile against alternative nodes/development teams in general. Why? All other network protocols have seen multiple implementations. As long as everyone agrees on developing and using libbitcoinconsensus, I don't really see the problem.
@_date: 2016-08-25 08:39:45






No it's freakin' not. _Do not_ conflate the term. As established in other posts here in this thread, Satoshi was very clear what he meant by a "block chain".


No, "private blockchains" - if it is going to even be remotely similar to Bitcoin's Blockchain, is going to be ineffective. If it's not, then it probably isn't a blockchain.
Also, SQlite isn't that inefficient.


Do you understand Bitcoin?


So people disagreeing with OP is cynical...?
@_date: 2016-08-14 23:38:55


Well... Maybe? It's market cap is much much lower than Bitcoin, as well as its total mining hashing power, which is why I'm saying that Bitcoin is the only working blockchain in large scale.  
It seems like you're kind of missing my point though. IBM isn't creating an altcoin with PoW.


Banks and companies hijacking the word blockchain should indeed get backlash. It's used as a way to undermine Bitcoin (and Litecoin for that matter). Articles often shit on Bitcoin while embracing "blockchains", or more specifically blockchains without PoW.

Yes but they switched to BitGo after that.
@_date: 2016-08-14 09:35:57
My definition is that there should only be one blockchain for money and smart contracts (but not everything, makes no sense for file storage for example which is why we have StorJ), and that all new features in altcoins will and should eventually make it to the Bitcoin blockchain (or maybe an alt-chain).
That's not to say that altcoins are bad, it's just that I don't believe it makes sense that those get widespread adoption, if an altcoin gets utility, the altcoin's functionality will and should make it to bitcoin's protocol.

I disagree, the claim is not comparable. Given a couple of confirmations, you'll be very safe in Bitcoin.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if the counterparty in a payment channel/LN tries to settle with an old transaction, you need to be actively looking in the network to claim the part of your funds.

Indeed, but even more so for very small transactions - A mining chip integrated into the hardware you're using will mine so little bitcoin it will be completely unmanageable without LN - even then I'm unsure, as with LN you need to have a commitment transaction plus a settlement transaction and they will probably have higher fees than the amount mined.

Austin Hill is an outside "entity".


I get your point, but the argument is that Blockstream is influencing bitcoin development _by not doing anything_. In other words refuting* a hard fork.


Well all* respect to Greg, but he certainly doesn't have a good track record against pro-hard fork people.
@_date: 2016-08-01 15:16:00
Good point, I'm actually not sure about desktop downloads and I guess it's much more difficult to figure out, but looking at Coinbase though, they claim 4.2M wallets and Blockchain.info claim 7M wallets, now we don't know how many I'd those contain any Bitcoin of course.
But yes I would agree with you that it seems like mobile wallets are not the most used type of wallets, thankfully.
@_date: 2016-08-16 09:51:57
I strongly disagree with this "sidechain" (which only exists in a federated way today) scaling solution, I actually find it to be quite silly. It feels like people suggesting such solutions really doesn't understand why people want to scale Bitcoin.
The whole _infrastructure_ is around Bitcoin, it won't just change to use a sidechain for commercial transactions. People have a hard time grasping Bitcoin, now they need to be aware the concept of sidechains too. Now, I know that wallets can probably abstract this away but still, the gap will be there.  
In other words no one will move to a sidechain for this purpose, and this is mostly because the network effect is around Bitcoin.
I have a very hard time understanding why people incite that this will/can practically happen. But please enlighten me. The argument seems to basically be the same as "You don't like Bitcoin and its limitations? Okay go and create your own alt-coin instead", but for altchains. I for one suggest _improving_ bitcoin instead, and that absolutely includes increasing the block size limit.
Side-note, I have kind of the same view with Lightning Network as well, as it will almost be the same thing (practically), as you will need to lock up your funds to LN.  
But I think the improvements are so significant with LN that it will be practically feasible.

Indeed. Good summary.


This is the thing that doesn't make sense, and, if it's true, is why it's ultimately BitGo's fault. The limit should have been _across_ all Bitfinex addresses and within a time frame.

Yes, a 28 activation grace period _once_ 75% hashing power support has been reached, not that the hardfork will necessarily be activated 28 days after the code was released, as your message makes it seem like.  
EDIT: All Bitcoin Core team soft forks have also had 4 weeks grace period.
And before you bring up that ETC succeeded with much less hashing power than 15% continued to live, the danger of hardforks between BTC and ETH are not directly comparable - the difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin taking 2016 blocks will effectively kill a 15% hashing power.

I don't think so. Although there were probably other markets around back then as well, but Bitcoin didn't die when Silk Road was closed.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:30:04
Well I think the thing is that Bitcoin is still pretty limited in its capabilities, but I guess we will be able to extend that more easily using soft forks when SegWit is in place with Script versioning. I know we've always been able to extend Script to an extent with  the placeholder op-codes but AFAIK using those had some downsides.
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:04:17


Fair enough, I missed that. It's what I meant.


I'll let go with the Litecoin because I'm not against altcoins, but again, the hashing and infrastructure isn't up with Bitcoin, which is why I personally don't think it is a working blockchain, _yet_.


Explain to me the legitimacy of private blockchains.  
If you know anything about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, you would say that a blockchain is backed up by miners incentive to hold up the longest chain, and they're doing so by (the reward of doing) Proof of Work (currently the only proven consensus algorithm).
This allows up upholding a decentralized network with no centrally controlled agency. Decentralization is one of the main purposes of Bitcoin.  
From the private chains I've heard about, none of them are going to use PoW for their supposedly blockchains, which for me doesn't make it a blockchain. It completely removes blockchains utility. But please explain why you think they are legitimate.


Uhm, yeah.


Exactly the issue. Blockchain pre-2015 meant a public immutable ledger backed by PoW. Now it seems like it's used in a such broad way, it has completely lost its meaning.

Indeed, but there are things like HD wallets where you can share your xpublic key, which lets a derive multiple addresses, but it has privacy issues. Other technologies like Payment codes/stealth addresses has usability and scaling issues (IIRC).
But yes, I don't mean binding one address to a username, that would be terrible.
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:50:51
Fair enough, it makes sense with not having soft forks in major releases - I didn't know that there were huge performance gains in 0.13.0, hence my comment.
If there aren't any huge performance improvements 0.13.0 I think it's kind of silly to be so pedantic about the versioning, but sure, being consistent could still be a good thing.

Interesting, so what does it translates to? A public key? Or a xpubkey? Because part of the issue is that we we don't want an account to be bound to a simple address, to prevent address reuse.

I'm aware of the development in that area, and without loss of privacy is still something that is being worked on.  
I didn't want to mention outsourcing in my previous post to keep it simple.  
Anyways, outsourced or not, it is _still_ a risk. In that sense, I don't think it's fair to claim it is "100% secure", it is disingenuous.

@_date: 2016-08-13 16:42:33
- SPVs not being perfect
- PaymentRequests (BIP70) still not fully utilized, the protocol allows you to have a receipt with all the items in a transaction in the wallet (not in blockchain).
- Mobile apps still really bad
And also one thing (that is related to the second point) I've been thinking a lot about over the years is that we still don't have kind of "username" system. Transactions in a wallet are still displayed as a random string. Now I know this is a really complex task to solve in a purely decentralized manner, but work desperately needs to continue here. [Payment codes]( is a good progression albeit not the perfect technical solution.

I disagree. We need a solution for the long term, and BIP101 is in my opinion the best contender.
The importance of getting it right ASAP (whenever Possible is, is a possible discussion) is something a lot seems to underrate.  
The reason why it's important to get it done soon is because it will be ___impossible___ to hard-fork later on when the network grows - just like it's practically impossible to replace email/http/javascript/&lt;name whatever web technology&gt; today. In 10 years *we will not be able to hard-fork*, maybe not even soft-fork. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:28:33

Well, I do have an answer: a blocksize increase.  
I don't think it's possible optimize forever. Look at file compression as an example, things haven't progressed so much in over 20-25 years. What is the best option, keep finding better file saving techniques and better compressions technologies on a 1MB hard-disk, or upgrading the hard-disk to newer one with more space? Sometimes it isn't possible optimize further.

Right, let's continue with another "myth".
ALL Lightning Network implementations today needs a transaction malleability fix. It is possible to do a LN without a malleability fix, but it would suck in comparison.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:50:27
What? Have you read what the thread is about?
@_date: 2017-02-11 23:22:21


I stated so.


"Simply requires"? You are aware that the number of fullnodes in the network are shrinking?


No it doesn't. It's a matter of letting millions of users benefit from LN or currently under 10,000. No matter how much you and I would like more fullnodes active on the network, it is simply not going to happen. Because of one reason: _convenience_.
Stating that SegWit/transaction malleability fix isn't needed for LN just fuels the anti-SegWit fire. It's not helpful.

Probably because he doesn't believe in Keynesian economics. Or maybe trying to appeal both gold bugs and libertarians.  I don't see how your reply is a counterpoint.

Please see my response to [atypingmonkey]( Just tell me if there's anything unclear.
High fees problem, well yes blocksize definitely need to be increased (=lower fees), there's no doubt about that. But LN is better than normal on-chain transactions, hence that will be used.

I think you're moving the discussion. I'm not denying that goals and motivations are not always achieved, but the intent of Bitcoin was to act as a replacement for PayPal and 3rd party middlemen. I don't understand how this cannot be clear enough.  
It doesn't go through any other methods on how accomplishing this, with or without Bitcoin.
Satoshi did however talk about how to scale up, later on in bitcointalk, via the predecessor to payment channels, using [sequence_no]( He/she also talked about moving full-nodes to datacenters, but this relied on fraud proofs for SPV, something that doesn't exist yet.

Fair point. It's more of a optimization and preparation for a blocksize increase.




Well yes, but the limit is certainly not 1MB. Something like Luke Jr's/Peter Wiulle's proposal (+17% yearly) could possibly work.  
Worth point out is that it's a softfork to decrease the blocksize limit.

Yes, I know what SegWit will do for us, and what SegWit will enable for us. I've been waiting for a transaction malleability fix years before SegWit even was proposed.  
I don't understand where you're getting the impression that I'm against it. Perhaps you should assume good faith?


Where did I say that? Did you even read my post(s) in this thread? I've never suggested that we shouldn't optimize at all in favor of a blocksize increase. In fact, I've stated _the opposite_, that we should implement all known new optimizations and features before anything else.  
What I am against, however, is claiming further scaling options that doesn't exist or haven't materialized yet, in favor of a hardfork blocksize increase. That, in my opinion, is really, really stupid.

Yes I was confused why you wrote "Schnorr/MAST", they are two completely different things, MAST helps with complex scripts, and could make LN transactions smaller for example. And Schnorr is a cryptographic signature algorithm, better and faster than ECDSA.


I disagree.


Decentralized sidechains does not exist today, and the drivechains proposal is far from being implemented, let alone the security problems with sidechains.
I keep hearing extension blocks, but I've never seen a proposal on how do do it. Is there any article/mailing list post out there?  
AFAICT extension blocks would be all too complex, as you would need to have two separate UTXO sets.




Two years ago I would have agreed that we should put in as much as possible in a hardfork, I'm not sure if I agree today because of how politicized the situation has become. I'm all in favor of fixing all warts and adding improvements/features that can only be done by a hardfork, but I think it would be even harder to do a hardfork then. A simple flexcap hardfork is good for me.

Yeah but you won't be opening a channel with the one you're sending to, you're completely missing the point of LN if you think that's the case.  
LN is a network of interconnected nodes, your nearest counterpart (which is a payment channel that will always be on) will forward your payment in a path until it reaches the destination. What you're talking about is normal payment channels.  
Read the Lightning Network whitepaper, in particular, take notice on how HTLCs and R work.

@_date: 2017-02-28 13:19:31




Doesn't change the effective blocksize AFAICT.


I disagree.
Schnorr and 1 signature aggregation will make 1MB handle lots of more transactions, but it's not a permanent fix. The more we delay a solution for a blocksize increase, the more difficult it will be to get it deployed.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:16:32


WTF this is not an advantage. Every node should upgrade to a Segwit node once it goes live, because it won't fully validate Segwit transactions otherwise.  
Later on, once it's implemented, we'll able to prune the witness(es) of transactions
@_date: 2017-02-27 10:55:04
Yeah sure, because we'll surely have _two_ hardforks. /s
We have to fix this problem NOW.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:31:18


Yeah they can stay on a pre-segwit version forever (thats what makes it a softfork).  
They won't be able to completely verify Segwit transaction's validity, as they cannot check if the signature is valid, so they need to be extra cautious and wait for many confirmations.
 
@_date: 2017-02-12 10:24:02


Uh, no that's not what I meant. It will eventually lead to saturation, so the no blocksize increase narrative is just stupid.
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:27:12


I keep hearing this conspiracy nonsense everywhere. Even from reputable people.


What specifically is expensive for you?


This is unfalsifiable. "Increasing" the block size could prevent you from running the node, but it could also not. It depends on how much the increase is. Would a 0.1MB block size increase matter? Probably not. +100MB? Probably.  


It doesn't weaken the Bitcoin network. Miners task is to strengthen the network.
EDIT: Yes, fullnodes are needed to keep miners in check, without full nodes, the network is not as secure, as miners could do whatever they want. It depends on what weakening mean in the context. Miners need to make sure that all transactions in a block are valid.

Here are some things that Segregated Witness paves the path for:
* [MAST]( Adds the ability to do bigger (in byte size) and more complex scripts, because you only need to reveal the actual code-path used to spend the input, instead of the whole script.
* Schnorr Signatures
* Lightning Networks (yeeeees sure sure, they are possible today, but all implementations today need a transaction malleability fix)
* Activation of new OP codes, [possibly these](
@_date: 2017-02-16 00:10:17

@_date: 2017-02-22 13:49:56


What?! Never heard that one before. You simply cannot securely bootstrap a new node without validating the signatures.


You're overblowing things way too much. Changing the blockheader to include the witness merkle tree wouldn't lead to _chaos_ for SPVs, but yes everyone would of course need to update.
The current coinbase setup is currently hack-ish, but I guess it's a fair compromise. You seem to implying that I'm for hardfork segwit, perhaps you should take a step back and look at my previous reply again.  
I'm not sure if the inverse square-root trick is comparable.

Yeah, I agree. Did you even read my post?


It's a bit disingenuous to say that there are "tons". Here are all known suggestions:
Tumblebit, Schnorr signatures, Peter Todd's sharding idea (hardfork), MAST, Lightning Network(s) and payment channels, Greg Maxwell's 1 signature aggregation (relies on Schnorr signatures), MimbleWimble (needs hardfork to be incorporated into Bitcoin AFAICT).
After these are activated, we shouldn't "consider" a hardfork to increase the 1MB limit, we should _do_ it.
I'm intentionally excluding sidechains.

Well yes, but the point still stands.


Sure, that's true. I'm not sure how the user nodes will be set up initially, IIRC it would be full-duplex, I'm not sure how half-duplex would even work.


AFAICT in the current LN protocol, the commitment transaction output to yourself will be CSV-locked, not CLTV.


Yes, but the problem isn't really that you need to scan it, it's more that you need to the full blockchain. 3rd party services will most definitely be used, and that's fine. I'm just stating that the security model will be changed.

P2WSH transactions are slightly bigger, for good reasons. SegWit _do_ expose the network up to ~3.7 MB of spam, fortunately it can be pruned as it's witness data, and witness data is discounted when counting the fee.
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:00:57
A gentle reminder... well, actually I say this almost every day:
_LN sucks without a transaction malleability fix_, and NO implementation today works without a transaction malleability fix. Stop this nonsense that it doesn't require SegWit; yes it is objectively true, but it desperately needs it.


No... just no. It won't work fine without SW, as you said, it would require everyone to use a fullnode (to watch for channel breaches). This would make sure it will never be adopted, as there are only 5000 nodes on the network.
You're just fueling the anti-SegWit fire by claiming that LN would work fine without it.


I'm sorry, but you do not decide how it should be. I want every user to have a fullnode as well, but you must realize that this isn't going to happen, at least not today.

Meanwhile miners 5 years from now will not give a shit if a transaction proposal is marked as RBF or not. They will happily accept a replacement transaction for a non-RBF transaction.
RBF is just a policy, you need to remember this.  
It won't be all black and white with non-RBF and RBF. This RBF stuff is a act against 0-conf altogether.

Yes. And while where at it, BIP34 blockheight should be moved too. Luckily Johnson's and Luke Jr's hardfork proposal fixes this.


Eh no? I've never said that.


I abolutely do. I work as a programmer.


Yes I know how hardforks work, chaning the block header is one of the most hardforky things you can do.


Excuse my language, but this is pure bullshit. Bloating the coinbase with things that shouldn't be there gives more technical debt than having it in the actual location where it should be. There's no way you can justify coinbase &gt; block header for storing the segwit commitment.

Maybe we have different definitions on what a colored coin is, but I don't view all arbitrary data in the blockchain as a colored coin. I view a colored coin as a alternative token on the blockchain (made possible OP_RETURN).


There are many other ways than with OP_RETURN, but then outputs are added to the UXTO.  
OP_RETURN was enabled (made IsStandard) in 2014 as a compromise to let application developers use a more friendly way to store arbitrary data in the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-02-12 11:46:12


Sure, we've been hearing this for 3 years.  
Adoption of a hardfork is not a matter of social support, it's a matter of possibility of upgrading infrastructure. If we keep delaying a hardfork, it will be practically impossible to hardfork, because of all hardware wallets, software wallets, nodes, services running on the network. It will stagnate, just as every other Internet protocol has done, and we would be stuck with 1MB blocksize which will be nidicolous in 10-15 years, not to mention what the fees would probably be.   
I'm completely fine with having a hardfork planned and scheduled 5 years into the future. I'm not fine with this passiveness, especially now when potentially dangerous solutions such as BU is gaining support.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:02:54


Why would you say that?
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:06:41
Your example is beyond retarded. The Red box here could be the acutal blockheader where information about the block should be placed, and the blue one could be the coinbase, which shouldn't actually have any consensus critical information at all.  
It's placed in the coinbase to keep Segwit a softfork, for convenience, but it comes with a price. Eventually we should hardfork away this wart, as Luke-Jr's and Johnson's hardfork proposal is doing.


Nope, you're missing the point again. The most important thing is to keep the information where it should be located.
Suppose a new developer starts developing bitcoin things. He read on about what the blockheader contains. He creates a structure containing the information from the blockheader.  
After that he learns about the softfork SegWit, and how he now needs to read out the coinbase, extracts its encoding to take out specific bits of it to get the witness merkle root hash, a completely different merkle root that is needed to make sure the block and its transactions are valid.
This is technical debt, because 
1. The witness merkle root is separated from the old transaction merkle root
2. The witness merkle root is placed in an arbitrary location and not in the blockheader where one would think such information would be placed.

It's just doesn't mean anything, 100,000 TPS would indicate that billions of people are using bitcoin, but with 1-2MB blocksize, it just won't be possible, by the reasoning in my previous post. It WON'T be possible.  
Say that many of the channel states active by the nodes of the network suddenly needs to settle on the blockchain. Millions of transactions would be in a queue if we're stuck with a 1MB blocksize and people risk losing funds  Claiming that 100,000 TPS would be practically possible isn't in line with reality.
100,000 TPS is technically possible just with 1 channel open, TPS is a bad metric.
@_date: 2017-02-12 02:11:25
You're missing the point, it will eventually take up all block space. LN/MAST/Schnorr/CoinJoin will make transactions more efficient, but it will still in the end lead to saturation of blocks. It's a false dichotomy to compare it to a blocksize increase, it will eventually be needed too.  
I'm fine with making transactions more efficient first, before anything else, but I'm not fine with denying the fact I stated above.
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:19:10

32MB seems all too low for me, and will probably be that in 30 years. I would say end at 64MB or even something like 512MB.
Don't forget that shrinking the blocksize is a _softfork_.

Who is Zooko?
@_date: 2017-02-25 13:17:17
Fixing transaction malleability via a new sighhash-type is not a hardfork, but a softfork. Read the original LN paper, it explains their initial solution.
@_date: 2017-02-12 23:51:45


I agree... This is becoming ridicolous. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 10:33:19


I don't have a particular preference, I would like a flexcap/dynamic, but as you said, they all seem to be gameable. I thought the block75 was interesting.
Luke Jr's approach seems fine, but I personally think it's ridiculously conservative, especially with initially shrinking the blocksize and I don't agree on ending the increment at 32MB. I would rather see it continue to higher number and perhaps softfork if it ever gets unmanageable.  
Regarding it being all too conservative, I guess it depends on how Lightning network, Schnorr and all other improvements play out, initially shrinking the blocksize might will be fine if everyone used LN. It would be amazing because then we would have more headroom for technology to improve.  
I'm not sure I've read any critiques on the mailing list, isn't Luke Jr's approach almost the same as Peter Wuille's (but adapted for SegWit/block weight)? Maybe I could check his proposal back from 2015.

I know how Bitcoin works, I obviously meant a proposal to Bitcoin Core, the software the vast majority of miners and nodes run, and developed by cryptographers and programmers that people trust. EDIT: Bitcoin can definitely do a scheduled hardfork in 5 years, via block height and BIP9 signaling.

I said specifically where SW as a SF could be messier (I'll state again: network (AKA net) layer). But yes, I will actually look at the code compared to 99% of all other people here.
--- 
Also,  putting the witness commitment in the coinbase is also almost objectively dirtier than having it in the blockheader.  
But putting it in the blockheader would make SW a hardfork, _even_ for SPVs, so I guess the trade-off definitely is justifiable.

(First and foremost, could you provide sources for your statements...?)
That's probably the weirdest argument I've ever heard here in _Hard drives_ are not the only storage technology, of course it will stagnate in price decrease, it has existed for damn 40 years! And you seem to be assuming that disk space in general _won't_ increase in size? Because I surely don't.  
Just with solid state disks, we're are set to increase in disk space. It's density will surpass the density of harddrives (with help from V-NAND): 


Yes, bandwidth capacities are far more important than disk space. I don't know why you even started to talk about harddrive space. CPU and network bandwidth are the constraints.


Where did I say LN is some magic bullet?  


Completely irrelevant to the discussion.  
But to answer, I'm well aware of the trade-offs of LN.


I know you bitcoin bugs love to despise coffee purchases. But again, you're straw maning yet again. I never said that we need $5 coffee transactions on-chain. Read my reply again. I said that the potential to reach global level would need a blocksize increase as well as other solutions.

They do not exist! Stop this nonsense already.  
Read my words: _Merged mined sidechains to the bitcoin blockchain do not exist today_.  And I don't understand how someone with a straight face can suggest sidechains as a scaling solution when the 51% coinstealing attack is not solved and perhaps never will be.


I know what drivechains are, the OP code needed is far from being implemented in the Bitcoin Script language. So again, it does not exist.


Suppose that a lot of contract breaches get broadcasted in to the bitcoin network, if the blocksize is stuck at 1MB and there's a long queue to get transactions confirmed, people risk losing actual bitcoin funds!


It is not a hulk-smash hammer approach. There's nothing dumb about a incremental increase of a blocksize. But perhaps the problem lies over the vision of what bitcoin should be. I want it to be used by everyone. Do you? If so, increasing the blocksize shouldn't be something to be against and stupid comments as this


Would never have been said.  
No matter how successful schnorr signature aggregation, Lightning networks, sidechains and MAST scripts will be a blocksize increase will be needed. There's just no way you can argue against that. Tell me  if you want me to go through all the things I listed and why they eventually need a blocksize increase in the long run.




No, this is a false dichotomy.  With lightning network, we need around 100MB to serve 7 billion people, but _no one_ has suggested a 100MB blocksize today. If you believe in continued technological progress, I don't understand why this would be any problem for you


Straw-man. I never said that on-chain scaling should meet world-wide demand. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:56:41


No, all remaining miners will have two weeks, otherwise their blocks risk being orphaned. Nodes can do whatever they want, but they should really upgrade once Segwit transactions stands for the majority of the transactions being made.

@_date: 2017-02-05 19:01:46


You need to read up on Bitcoin and LN if you don't think LN will need a blocksize increase. LN is _NOT_ a final solution to the blocksize debate, it just makes Bitcoin more efficient. Removing an arbitrary limitation is still needed in the long run, even more so with LN, as it could catastrophically fail if the blocks are full and a lot of LN contract breaches (aka old channel states) get broadcasted to the bitcoin network. Which would lead to loss of funds.
EDIT: this presentation is somewhat old and I believe the current state of the art should be a bit more efficient, but it provides some numbers on what a blocksize cap should need to be with LN being mainstream, I also want to emphasize that externalities would be pushed towards channel monitoreres that needs to look out for contract breaches in the network, those services would potentially need to store terabytes of different channel states):
 (slide 51)


Yeah sure, 2 parties could keep a payment channel open and do 100,000 TPS... 100,00 TPS across millions of users? No way with 1MB. Far too dangerous.


Yes, this is why a blocksize increase is needed in the long run.
@_date: 2017-02-19 10:00:24
Yes, but it's unsure how you would send them. As soon as your try to send them your public key is broadcasted, so a quantum fullnode/miner could attempt to double spend as soon as they get the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:39:34


There's no chance that you'll be able to mine on the main-chain.  
Sending transactions, could work, especially with LN.

Yes, I'm not denying it.


Perhaps you should focus on those issues then, in the mean time I'll be fine with having a LN wallet on my phone that connects to a channel monitor, paying a small fee for the service.  
The reason of the fullnode decline is because of the convenience of running SPVs and custodial wallets. This isn't going to change very easily.

@_date: 2017-02-09 10:55:49


We need more than 51% SegWit miner support to make sure that non-upgraded nodes will follow the SegWit chain.
In a 51% - 49%, split it could result in the 49% nonsegwit chain being orphaned, and that's fine. But if SegWit is &lt; 50% support, it's doomed to fail. Segwit support &gt; 50% would give  non-upgraded incentive miners to upgrade, as they risk losing mining reward otherwise.


Well yes, on the non-segwit chain, it would be spendable.


I don't think so. The blocktimes would be too high (in 5% hashpower).
@_date: 2017-02-19 09:50:31
Aspie checking in; that has nothing to do with a softfork.
But actually, when I think about it, a softfork can be closed source, if 51% of the miners conspire against fullnodes and other miners.  
They can even choose to do malicious things like completely forbidding transactions. The only way to fix it is to hardfork from the current chain.

If you think you can do normal bitcoin transactions with a LN wallet, you're completely wrong. Read the LN whitepaper please, I don't know what more to say.


You're simply wrong. There will be no transaction on the blockchain until the channel state closes, hence you cannot spend to an normal bitcoin address (without a proxy service, that is).
Your funds are tied together with your counterparty via payment channel. The magic LN does it that it enables routing through many different interconnected payment channels via "HLTCs". Those funds that are tied cannot simply be spent somewhere else.
If there's something I'm missing, please provide more information. Preferably technical.


That might be true. A re-negotiation of the contract for the channel probably needs to be made.
EDIT: If you mean that channel states will be closed/opened and/or re-negotiated everytime a user wants to spend to a normal bitcoin address, I got your point. I haven't seen any documentation on a such feature being standardized though.
Edit2: To clarify, LN itself cannot support sending to a normal bitcoin address. It is fundamentally impossible. What is possible to do though is re-negotiate a new commitment transaction, by closing the old channel and spend the funds to the new one, _but_ also have an output to the normal bitcoin address, taking a cut from your funds.

Yes RBF is currently a flag. But it is also a *miner and node* policy, it is *not* a consensus rule.. Miners 8 years from now might not give a shit about your flag, as they have a incentive to maximize profit, as the block reward gets lower, there's more chance that this will happen - If you've ever listened to Peter Todd talking about RBF, you would have known this.
Opt-in RBF is a transition to ultimately eliminate 0-conf altogether and have only RBF transactions.

Originally intended by Satoshi to work like payment channels, where you revise your payment over and over again, but instead of locking in to a multi-sig address with your counterparty, the state would be updated while the transaction were in the mempool.
This wasn't possible to enforce by consensus (because rules in mempool is impossible today to enforce), a miner could just confirm an old sequence number.  
nSequence was re-purposed by Peter Todd to be used to lock a confirmed output until a certain date or block in the future ("CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY").  
This proved to be useful, but even more useful would be a way to let an output be locked until a _number of_ days/blocks in the future, relative to when the transaction was first confirmed in a block ("CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY", by BtcDrak, Eric Lombroso, Mark Friedenbach).
To recap:
* Old purpose: Being able to update an transaction based on a sequence number (starting with 0), in the mempool. This isn't possible to enforce by consensus 
* [CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY]( Uses the nSequence field to lock an already confirmed output to a specific date in the future,
* [CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY]( Uses the nSequence field to lock an already confirmed output to a specific day or block height in the future, specified in days/blocks/more instead of a specific date.

One of the principles of Bitcoin is to eliminate cases of Single point of failure.

The issue is pretty complex, but it comes to hard forks, which is a backwards-incompatible network upgrade. Lots of people are afraid that it will cause major disruptions to the network, and some people are concerned about the ethics of a such update (i.e forcing people to upgrade).
Personally I found it really silly, morality and feelings should have no place in the discussion, if we all think it's necessary to have bigger blocks (which is absolutely critical to adoption, despite LN and other improvements), we need to really get together now and fix this until it's too late and too difficult to reach consensus.
SegWit is a stop-gap solution until we can further scale the bitcoin network, it's just not only about the blocksize (but I don't want to undermine the importance of a blocksize increase, which a lot of people seems to do).
Regarding fees specifically, there are different views in what it should be, Bitcoin is supposed to sustain itself from transaction fees once the block reward subvention ends (~2030 IIRC, it really ends around 2140, but it will be really low around ~2030).  
Some people believe that we'll need to artificially limit the blocksize to keep the fee pressure up, while others believe it will solve itself (i.e miners won't mine transactions with too low fee).  
People argue that bitcoin will be unsustainable if the blocksize cap is too high and if transaction fees therefore is dirt low. This is why the blocksize cap might should be just a little big above the avg blocksize.


Well code-wise, the bitcoin network has no idea what a too high fee is, so there is no techinical solution for this. And as explained above, a higher transaction fee might be needed for the use of the application (resistant and censorship free money with no borders).
This would also be a hardfork.
Regarding hardforks, I think people are too over sensitive and make false comparisons to the DAO hardfork fiasco.  
A fundamental property of a blockchain is transaction immutability, which the DAO hardfork completely violates.  
A _blocksize_ is a completely different thing, and is not a fundamental property or rule of a blockchain, and as such, should not be met with the same amount of contention.  
I think once (and _if_) we have a solid blocksize proposal that the majority of the technical community agrees upon, we'll see almost unanimous support across miners.

Well SegWit is much more than that, it's 1000x better than just a simple malleability fix. For example, Schnorr 1-sig aggregation could make multiple inputs cheap, because you can merge the signature of different inputs into one.  
And as you probably know, MAST is a godsend.


I did in, another context.  
What I'm saying is that sidechains as solution for scaling is much more unclear than blocksize increases or Lightning Network. We need to have a plan on _how_ it would actually work, wallet-wise, feature-wise, transition-wise...


I find UASF very interesting, but I haven't seen any message from Peter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, Adam Back and others about it on the mailing list (exception Luke), just a lot of excitement from random people. It's very unclear at the moment if it would actually work and be a good idea.  
I will say this though, if miners refuse to acknowledge what the industry, the infrastructure and the economic majority wants, then they should be punished. The best way to show our power is probably through UASF.

You can set up a full node, generate an address and then create an encrypted backup file of your wallet and save this file in "cold storage".
CC @_date: 2017-03-02 23:47:37
Yes some people want the number of full nodes to go up and I agree... it really needs to.  
But you won't be able to use LN as a trojan horse for it, LN will just simply fail if it needs a full node.
There needs to be a real incentive to run a full node, right now it's just so convenient to run a SPV wallet.

@_date: 2017-03-16 10:37:55
I know this will be a controversial opinion, but I stand 100% by it:
Maybe in 1-2 years.  
YES, lnd and lighting-c implementations are doing good, but those are not user friendly wallets. On top of that, we need 3rd party monitor services checking the blockchain for contract breaches. These services needs to be setup before we're ready.
So to summarize:
* lnd and lightning-c are doing great
* We need real Lightning wallets for mobile phones, these does not exist. It isn't just a plug-and-play for existing wallets as some people seem to believe.
* 3rd party monitor services need to be launched, otherwise paying in the LN will be unsafe. Hopefully BitPay, Coinbase etc are planning on providing this
* My guess is that we'll need to have LN -&gt; normal btc address proxy services so that LN wallets can pay to normal bitcoin addresses. These will most likely need trust though (if it's possible to do trustless, please explain and correct me here) EDIT: Regarding LN -&gt; BTC proxies, see the discussion with sQtWLgK below.
This is not even mentioning other parts of the infrastructure, online shops (BitPay), exchanges, gambling sites/games, darknet that also need to set up their nodes/services.
So yeah, be excited. But do not expect anything anytime soon. Especially now with the stalemate position with SegWit (everytime someone mentions that LN "works" without SegWit/transaction malleability fix (even Tadge confirmed that it probably won't and it would suck balls), a kitten will die).
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:44:20
Perhaps that was a naive assumption...
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:47:34


Yes but support and development by wallets, exchanges, services and the rest of the industry is not.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:27:49


If we're going to have a timebomb, perhaps a soft-hardfork would be more sufficient.
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:51:56
Assume good faith. Do you seriously believe that Gavin Andresen and the Bitcoin classic guys have any conspiracy with Mike Hearn and R3CEV? That is just insane.
As for the blocksize increase, there are actually people who are concerned about hitting the cap. In my opinion [it is dangerously close](
The core devs don't want to do anything so the industry and the miners have no choise other than to move to Classic.  
And there's one thing about this move that people somehow are getting wrong, *this is no end all be all scenario!* The core devs will be forced to adapt, and maybe some people chose to move back to Core because of this. It's not like some kind of Coup d'état will happen.

This miners gets a mining reward plus transaction fees, full nodes (P2P actors) will only accept a "valid" block (i.e no double spendings).


That is why you need to wait until the transaction reaches the blockchain.


Full nodes validate the chain that miners spend energy (and therefore money) on.    
If miners tries to do something malicious (such as spending the same coin twice), full nodes in the network would reject a such block.
Again, this makes the miners have incentive to be honest, because they earn money by doing that.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:03:55
Good suggestion!
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:23:46


Segwit is a plain blocksize increase for upgraded nodes.  
BU too, once miners signal for it.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:39:12
Yes, please stop this insane rbtc witch-hunt, I don't give a fuck.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:29:43


Does it really? It sounds more like some kind of extension block, where we cut off the old block in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:20:08
If China banned bitcoin mining we would have much bigger problems than activating Segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:23:27
Bitcoin scripts _can_ have multiple codepath leading to a validation.  
Right now with P2SH, you have to publish the whole script, even those paths that  didn't lead to validation.
With MAST, you only need to publish the code that actually lead to a validation of the script.
I said "can" in cursive, because right now, that would be too expensive. As an example, MAST could enable [3-out-of-2000 multi-sig]( something that is not feasible today.
Oh and it could also make LN settlement transactions more efficient.
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:09:41
I rather speak for myself.

@_date: 2017-03-27 09:15:49


[What kind of bullshit is this?](
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:31:07


Yes and no.  
Yes LN will help with scaling better than any other alternative out there, but no, LN will eventually need a blocksize increase as well. Settlement transactions absolutely need to be able to reach the blockchain, otherwise people risk losing money.  
It simply isn't one way or another, but _both_.


There's no universal agreement that Extension blocks is the right way to go, but it is very interesting.


I'm fine with that.


Eh what? SegWit is the last "normal" blocksize increase without a hardfork (not counting extension blocks)
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:27:21
It's not, old nodes would follow the Segwit-chain​, should it have the most hashpower.  
Just because it can cause a chainsplitt doesn't mean it's a hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:23:41
Yes, but it will suck. A transaction malleability fix is needed to let 3rd party monitors check the channel state. Without that, everyone who wants to use LN "trustless-ly" will need to run a full node.
SegWit also greatly helps adding new features to the scripting language of Bitcoin, such as Schnorr Signatures, MAST...
@_date: 2017-03-11 12:12:29
Good points... Miners wtf are you waiting on? 75% percent node support...

@_date: 2017-03-22 13:38:32


Good. Could you please support the activation of SegWit then?
On-chain today scaling is _not_ critical, and despite fees being high, I think that's something we should count on - Bitcoin's popularity have grown  faster than the technological improvement (both in code and in actual hardware).  
We should work together for a blocksize proposal that does _not_ give miners any power under any circumstances. Like an incremental blocksize over time, not decided by miner signaling parameters (like in Bitcoin Unlimited).
In other words, it's better to preserve the decentralization of Bitcoin than raising the blocksize.  
Schnorr signatures, Coinjoin, MAST and then in the mid-term Lightning network, will all help for scaling, even on 1MB blocks. But make no mistake, a blocksize increase will eventually also be needed even for Lightning Network.
Do not support Bitcoin Unlimited and their messy abomination of a code. Support the technical community on finding the best way to scale.

@_date: 2017-03-17 00:23:26
There are subtle differences that makes it not a hardfork. In scenario B, old non-segwit nodes would not "reject" the segwit-chain, they would just simply chose to follow the non-segwit chain because it has more hashing power. If the Segwit chain were to become the chain with most hashing power, old nodes would follow it.  
Under a hardfork, old nodes would under no circumstances​ follow the Segwit-chain (if segwit was a hardfork, which is isn't).   
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:23:56

I guess it depends on how far you want to go down the rabbit hole.
So yes, sure... It might be _borderline_ possible, if you want to argument to ad absurdum.  
But what good does it really do to claim that is "totally possible" without SegWit?  
Really, the best action would be to continue to actively promote Segwit instead.

No why? Why compromise to do a hardfork when SegWit is a softfork in the first place?!
A real compromise would be if Core devs and other parts of the technical community would reach conensus on a long-term plan for the blocksize, like a flexcap or incremental increase, so we never need to care about this again.  
But for some reason I can't explain, people doesn't seem to interested on fixing this any time soon, albeit there are some interesting proposal recently (like LukeJr's and also t. khan's).

The 1MB is a fundamental property of bitcoin today. We cannot really scale massively _even with LN_ without raising the limit.
LN will give us a lot of headroom though.

Right, it always comes down to if we should plan for success or not.  
You're right that we might never get there, but why shouldn't we _try_?


I'm allergic to this hand-waiving nonsense. For the 1000th time, two-way P2P sidechain pegs does not exist today, and it's unclear if it ever will.  
What's even more unclear if it's really the right way to scale, because of the security implications.  
I like sidechains as an idea (non-federated of course), but I strongly dislike claiming that it would help for scaling.


I think we've talked about this before, but it's also unclear of the implications of softfork extension blocks, but my bet is on this if we cannot get a hardfork blocksize increase.

Linux is not one thing. Probably less than 10% of all Linux users actually compile their own kernel, GRUB, DE and everything else needed. The rest is using pre-compiled binaries, so it is as likely to contain a backdoor as Windows is.
Also as a side-note, it is not impossible for NSA to have a backdoor in the Linux kernel, as numerous attempts in doing so has been caught throughout the years, by subtle bug fixes and whatnot.  
Take caution.

As far as I understand, it's a sidechain that uses 1:1 peg to Bitcoin.  
The sidechain has a turing complete virtual machine that works like Ethereum (it can run Ethereum scripts) but is better on a number of points.
In other words, it's like Ethereum but works in symbiosis with Bitcoin, and but uses merge-mining.  
It's going to eat Ethereum's lunch.

You're not understanding Core's stance in this debate.
The reason they're pushing out SegWit and potentially increasing the effective number of transactions in a 1MB block is because they can *avoid* a hard fork at this point in time. They think it's too dangerous.
The credibility of time and time again avoiding a *blocksize increase* is up to discussion though.
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:40:59
Yes, but you're missing the point, the SegWit blocksize increase is still a stop-gap solution. What I meant was obviously a long term solution (flexcap/incremental).

It would need to go up.
If more users use LN, more settlement transactions (LN term) need to be put in the blockchain. It all depends on what view on Bitcoin you have.  
You want Bitcoin to be used by 2M people? Sure, block segwit.  
You want Bitcoin to be used by 200M users? Do Not block segwit.

The blocksize increase hardfork that initially limits the blocksize to 300KB.
I think it's a bit too conservative and I don't agree on ending on 32MB, but I like the idea of limiting it to 300KB. Mainly to preserve  decentralization.
Schnorr sig/1 sig aggregation, MAST and eventually LN will all help to make it feasible to run at 300KB.

I don't want people to treat it like a "normal" currency (whatever normal means). I don't want that *today*.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, the industry, infrastructure and technology is still just building up. Using bitcoin to make online payments or pay to another person is still sometimes inconvenient.
Bitcoin still fluctuates a lot, which makes non-tech savvy and uninterested people uncomfortable, and that's good. That gives us more time and incentive on making the platform and infrastructure better.
When people talk about bitcoin, they often unfairly compare it to a government backed 100+ years old currency such as the USD, that has had years and years to stabilize and also has one of the (few) benefits of centralization, that it can easily adapt and change. People look at bitcoin on what it is today, they don't look on what it can be and provide for the world in the future. This mostly comes from lack of information and often misinformation. I want people understand bitcoin and think about what it *might* provide for the world in the future. While they do that, they should buy just about $20 of bitcoin as a means of support.

What's more important:

Isn't it a bit naive to just _trust_ opinions? If there's one thing someone should've learned while being involved in Bitcoin is to minimize trust.  
Also, I never said that you should do research "for a few days", I didn't conclude any timeline, I'm just saying that you should actually go and read what BU is, instead of listening to all propaganda and smearing going on here on reddit.  
I did it, and I found BU to be dangerous.


Are you claiming that there are dissenting experts that have years of experience of BU? I respectfully refute that. I don't think many people have done so much research on BU at all, probably because people simply don't find the solution to be interesting or helpful in the first place.


Again, straw-man. I didn't say you need to be an expert on anything.

Lol, don't let the other camp know!


Why is it non-trivial? I think the well established "btc" is a better choice, even if it's one more char, or whatever more bits that would be.  
The BIP said QR codes would be 45% more compact because of the use of alphanumeric mode, so it seems like a reasonable trade-off.  
Otherwise, perhaps removing the separator ("1") could work as well?
Also, are you looking for help developing reference implementations? I could maybe help writing implementations in Rust and PHP. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:31:25


It depends on the scenario. If &gt; 50% of the miners choose to cooperate on day 0, not all old nodes would need to update.  
If miner support &lt; 50%, 100% of all nodes would actually need to update to be perfectly safe. The majority of the miners would hard fork in that scenario.   
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:29:51

@_date: 2017-02-01 08:29:53


No, this is a softfork according to the current terminology. The whole idea with softforks is that miners get forked out of the chain if they don't follow the more stricter rules, while fullnodes just follow the longest chain (most hashing power).
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:19:01


Gotcha, cool.
Any other interesting applications you've come up with?  
I see OP_RAND and other OP-codes.


So you're saying that a payment token using OP_PUBDERIV to derive keys should only be used and shared amongst one counterparty (but can be used multiple times), because of privacy implications of sharing it to others?  
In other words, kind of like sharing the xkeypub (BIP32)?

I disagree. it's not that different. The real difference is that the Bitcoin network needs, by its design, to be much much more conservative and compliant across nodes, otherwise disasters are bound to happen.


I had this opinion of having multiple node implementations long before the big blocksize debate begun.






It seems like you're attacking the idea that different node implementations should incentive hard forks on the network, which is something I _do not_ support without widespread (human) consensus. This is not what I was suggesting and why I took up xthin vs compact and btcd, and the importance of libbitcoin-consensus, did you even read my reply?

@_date: 2016-06-26 12:51:44


















Well, that's your opinion... Would say the same thing about BitTorrent? Should we use just one client there as well?  
Having different clients surely is healthy, therefore we would actually have competition about xthin blocks vs compact blocks, instead of Core just deciding that compact blocks is the best solution.
With that said, the consensus part is very fragile and important, which is why I suggest every node implementation (well there is only Bitcoin core and its forks and btcd) to use libbitcoin-consensus.

While I do think that both sites both sides (I'm not sure what sides you are talking about) between KISS and Improve Bitcoin have valid points, I tend to lean towards the Improve Bitcoin-side, because SegWit means we can finally and safely use:
_Smart contracts_
As some of you know, Sipa abandoned BIP62 in favor of SegWit, because hacking and limiting the signature validation wasn't going to be good enough or even be able to cover every issue (or unknown issue), the cleanest solution is simply to segregate the wittiness data from the transaction.  
It's a clean solution that isn't clean, if get what I'm saying.

No.  
Lighting Network cannot do magic, and it will also eventually need a blocksize increase _as lightning is still dependent on bitcoin_.
About 100MB blocks will be needed to support everyone in the world.

Miners already control the blocksize, they can even softfork the rules to 1 transactions per block. That is just as scary, if not more, than a blocksize increase.  
Also how could you know that giving miners the control of the block size (over the current upper limit, I assume?) would be a disaster?

I guess you're being sarcastic here, but sure, I've also heard about that fix, last time I checked it'was stuck at ~20-30% miner support.
But to continue, enabling orders of magnitude more scaling definitely needs a block size increase beyond what said transaction malleability fix will provide. Ultimately a _hard fork_.

SegWit is absolutely mandatory as it will prevent something called "transaction malleability", where two transactions spending exactly the same input and having the same output could be crafted to have different cryptographic signs creating two different hashes.
Two different transactions spending the same input and having the same output means that wallets will mark one of them as a double spend, which ruins smart contracts.

Well eventually it would probably need to be placed in memory, as search times would be too high on disk. But if the UTXOs grows faster than the progress in memory technology (which it does), then we have a disturbing problem. That's why Segwit rules to disincentive making large number of UTXOs is needed. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:50:38
I hear this argument a lot. I don't believe it's true. 
Edit: to clarify, of course we'll run in to the same problem again, but to say it's to kick the can down the road is a bit wrong, it's a capacity increase, a much needed one.
LN will help to make transactions not settle everytime on the blockchain, but we'll eventually run into a blocksize problem anyway.

I also had a realization when I re-watched the video you provided above that you only really need to get the list of txid's of blocks (Tadge talked about this in the end/Q&amp;A part).
What I'm trying to is that there are many different possibilities to be "safe" in Lightning.

If someone broadcasts (to the blockchain) an old channel state, where you had less money, money is effectively stolen. How LN and Payments channels work is that, if someone attempts to broadcast an old channel state, you can punish the counterparty be claiming all funds inserted into the channel. This, however, requires you (or someone that you've delegated the task to) to monitor the blockchain.


Yes, here's an example:
1. Alice and Bob opens a channel by committing 0.5 BTC each into the channel. (Commitment transaction 1)
2. Alice pays Bob 0.25 BTC for a pair of socks. Current balance is Alice: 0.25 BTC, Bob: 0.75 BTC (Commitment transaction 2)
3. Alice now goes ahead and broadcasts commitment transaction 1 (which is still a valid Bitcoin transaction) into the blockchain. A contract breach has happened.
4. The way Lightning network works is that, Bob now has a period of time where he can punish Alice for broadcasting the wrong channel state. If Bob does this, he will claim _all_ funds on the payment channels. In other words, _there's a strong incentive to co-operate_.


In a normal operation, a channel would never need to settle on the blockchain, the only cases are if a counterparty is not responding, or tries to settle an old channel state.

@_date: 2017-01-12 13:36:16


You're welcome.


I think the period will be set to 3 days, but this number is arbitrary, IIRC this can be negotiated by lightning nodes on channel opening. So you have three days to make sure that your counterparty isn't trying to fraud you.
The three day breach period could mean (in the worst case)  that your funds could possibly be locked for three days if you were to settle (the valid commitment transaction of) the payment channel on the blockchain. But if your counterparty is online and are co-operating, you do not need to wait three days, you could just re-negotiate a new commitment without these timelocks and broadcast it.


I am not sure, perhaps you do not need to choose just one route for your whole payment.


We've no idea of knowing how LN will all play out yet, I remain optimistic. Hopefully malicious behavior will not be seen so often in the network as there's just too much at stake for them. 


Well, you need the whole blockchain to be secure (a fullnode), and not many people operate full nodes today, and really shouldn't need to IMO.  
There will be third party channel monitors, I expect Coinbase, BitPay and others to provide services for this. Possibly and hopefully for free, but I foresee a future where this would have a cost. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:13:59


I agree, second layer solutions will be needed for microtransactions.  
Your assertion was that it is cheap compared to the alternatives, perhaps my example was a bit extreme though, but sometimes it is not.

It depends on what "complete power" means. You most likely need to outsource this, and it might could cost money,  if you don't want to monitor the blockchain yourself 24/7, which I think the vast majority of bitcoin users won't do.  
I think it could be considered a centralization risk, even though channel monitors cannot know your transactions..

As I said, Core is not Blockstream, the majority of Blockstream are _not_ actively working on Bitcoin Core. Take a look on their website if you do not believe me. Saying that Blocksteam is the vast majority of the manpower behind Bitcoin Core is _very_ disrespectful to other contributors that actually stand for the vast majority, such as Jonas Schnelli, Wladimir der Laan, Cory Fields, fanquake.
But this is all completely off topic. My question "What you doing?" was meant to reference to what Blockstream was supposed to do when they went public 2014. It was a frustration of the lack of progress of 2-way peg sidechains with merge mining.

Yes, I do want bitcoin to be used for purchases, which is why I'm actually myself really bearish in bitcoin (compared to the market... tough situation).  
Unfortunately the market and the infrastructure seems to disagree with me, as BIP70 development has stagnated and transaction identification is still through wallet addresses. Bitcoins development in this area is completely stale and any attempt to fix it is refuted as anti-bitcoin and pro-KYC (see the BIP75 debacle).  
What I mean is; I don't want to use bitcoin addresses with stores and friends, I want easy a more convenient identification system and I'm fully aware of that there are really difficult trade-offs here, but I think it's absolutely key for adoption.

@_date: 2016-11-23 19:06:16
Thanks for the discussion Cbergmann and Lejitz.
I agree on Lejitz position, Bitcoin and blockchain's most valuable feature is immutability.  
My view though is that immutability will happen naturally with time as the infrastructure is being built and more people get involved, as with all other internet protocols (TCP/UDP/DNS/email stays the same because it's practically impossible to change).
Forcing down this extreme position of no compromise to uphold the value of immutability is premature, because we shouldn't rely on social pressure to enforce that - as pointed out above, the value of bitcoins immutability is in its impracticability to change.
We have a shot in fixing Bitcoin now and in the coming few years, as the time goes by the system will self-lock itself because there would simply be too many hardware/nodes/software/miners to be able to coordinate a hardfork (see IPv4 vs IPv6). We should ASAP work on fixing a long time plan for scaling, as well as fixing any trailing bugs in the system.
Regarding the decentralization risks of a blocksize increase.  
Yes, I absolutely agree that a node should always be able to operate under Tor or a Tor-like network, I'm in favour of a conversative increase over a time interval to keep this possible.
But I would like to assert this, the reason why there aren't so many full nodes today is _not_ because of bandwith/space issues, it's because it's simply more convenient to use web and SPV-wallets. I don't believe limiting the blocksize would do anything to change that or the down-going trend of number of full nodes.
Regarding that Satoshi envisioned Payment channels, this is _somewhat true_. He relied on network-layer "rules" rather than enforced blockchain concensus. The old nlocktime was unrealiable/unsafe, hence it was disabled, but Satoshi did indeed have the idea of "redefining" one transaction (that masks many different transactions) and then settle on the blockchain later on, the problem was that there was no way of enforcing that the latest iteration would be published, as a miner could just choose which version to publish - This is what LN and Payment channels elegantly fixes with (the new) nlocktime, CLVT/CSV and multisignatures, as there will be an incentive for actors to publish the latest transactions or risk losing funds, this is also why LN users will ultimately need to rely on third parties to check to blockchain for fraud on behalf of the user (AFAIK Rusty has been working on techniques to make it so the transaction cannot be seen for the watcher). It is of course possible for users to watch the blockchain for fraud themselves, but they would need to run a full node then (AFAICT).

I'm aware of this fundamental problem for merge PoW mined sidechains.

Bitcoin Core does not develop Lightning Network. I do not think there is a clear conflict of interest. Even though I slightly disagree with this, I think they want to scale bitcoin in other areas first before raising the blocksize (compact blocks, Schnorr sigs, MAST). I also think they want to develop a fee market, which is unfortunate, because it's _very_ premature at this point in time (miners get 12.5 BTC per block).


Well said, I'm in the same stance as you.

@_date: 2016-11-25 07:12:34




Yes, I remember the BDB bug, and I agree that quick coordination happens if Bitcoin is "damaged".  
Unfortunately, I don't think miners care enough to push this further if 95% doesn't happen. It would require Bitcoin Core to release the plan for them, which I don't see ever happening. I don't think they'll compromise on lowering 95% to 51%, and that's a good thing.




True.  
It would still require them to change it, which is not their expertise.




Perhaps I'm wrong here but, for the 95% nodes, the non-segwit chain would still be valid. To orphan the non-segwit chain out, AFAIK it would require the Segwit chain to be longer than the non-segwit chain, which would be very uncertain as the Segwit chain only have 51% support. This made me realize a 51% softfork is actually more dangerous than I first thought.

Completely common opinions.


I think I do, it's normally used against SJWs and alike, but I think it's clearly justified in this case. [Here's the definition from Wikipedia]( Take your time to read it.  
The first sentence reads:


Within this social group, praising Blockstream and Bitcoin Core team and despising the other subreddit is common, it's nothing controversial, hence the virtue signaling. 


I disagree, that's usually how SJWs often _work_, but not exactly what virtue signaling needs to mean.


I am grateful, this is off topic.


Me neither, my issue, as I've tried to express here, is that his comment isn't purely a positive social reinforcement, he's actively shitting on the other side. If he truly only cared about positive news such as what this thread is about, a simple


would be enough.  But his comment is instead political.


Sorry I couldn't care less about someone else's feelings. I do know that they get a lot of unjustified shit, especially Greg, but he's also actively engaging in the conversation.


In that case yes. How did Flexible transaction get appreciated now again? Oh right, the _implementation_ was trashed, but the idea wasn't even discussed.

I suspect many people have bad blood because of the stale mate position of a hard fork that has been going on for 2 years. I hope everyone will eventually come around and signal SegWit.


The explanations in the infographics that has been going around here are just terrible.  
The two major important things that SegWit fixes are "transaction malleability" (making sure that a transaction in the mempool (not confirmed) cannot be mutated (which changed txid) by 3rd party nodes) as well as fixing Sighash calculation (basically it makes signature hashing computation linear instead quadratic which is an very important scalability and anti-DOS fix).

Flexible transactions replaces the current transaction header with a flexible one, where new fields can be added (via soft forks for consensus-changing things IIRC), so I don't really understand the (presumably fud?) that people are spreading here.  
But yes, the Flexible Transactions proposal is its currency form does not have a field for nlocktime, but I don't see any obstacles in just adding it.

I like the aggressive guy (Muckey?) and I think he has good points, but I don't agree with his argument that a hard fork won't (or shouldn't) happen because it will always be contentious (because there will be disagreements).
The same actually applies to _soft forks_, there could be disagreements, but the thing here is it that full nodes won't be able to refute a stricter rule set by the very nature of how bitcoin works. Despite the "safety" of soft forks, this makes softforks malicious as well, as miners could soft fork to _limit_ the blocksize futher, or even softfork to completely remove the ability to include transactions (except the coinbase transaction) in a block.
Shouldn't you be against soft forks as well for this reason?
I'll bring up my point that I've said a couple of times here. The impossibility to hardfork should not rely on social pressure. It will happen naturally as the infrastructure (node, miners, hardware) continues to build up. This applies to every other internet protocol we've ever seen before (IPv4, DNS, email).  
I think we have a shot now in a couple of years timeframe to have a blocksize hardfork (hopefully incremental over time), before it gets to practical impossibility, but perhaps it has already reached that point already.
@_date: 2016-11-26 11:28:51
Right, if nodes are uncooperative, it would need to settle on the blockchain. I guess we'll have to wait and see how it will plays out in practice.

 I think it comes down to different values and views.  
But yes, definitely, it would be a huge failure according to me. I want Bitcoin to grow and compete with other big currencies, I want it to create new types of opportunities and businesses, because I believe on the technology.  
The conservative view seems to be focusing on keeping the Bitcoin network together, censorship resistant and decentralized, and there's nothing wrong with that. But there _must_ be a balance between these two views.


That's your interpretation sure. Sounds reasonable.


And Bitcoin will. As we all know, Bitcoin is _not_ like Ethereum where they plan a hard fork every other week, it's completely the opposite.  
I don't see how this has anything to do with a block size increase though.


And I didn't say it wouldn't be promising.


It is a distraction, I think innovation has stalled for the last two years which is perhaps even more worrisome, but the debate will not die just because you disagree with the pro-increase side.
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:30:28

No, Segregated Witness is staged to be activated if it gets enough miner support. So hopefully soon.
Bitcoin has never been instantaneous though, broadcasting transactions is, but the time it takes before it reaches a block in the blockchain is around 7-10 minutes. A block can only be max 1MB, so there's a limit on how many transactions can go in to a click every 10 min. This is what a block size increase (Segregated Witness in this case) fixes.
_Lightning Network_ practically gives  instantaneous transactions though, through abstractions.

Bitcoin 0.13.1 have code that activates at 95% block support within a 2016 block period. It would take tremendous coordination between miners to upgrade to some kind of self-compiled 0.13.1 version that activates at 51%.
EDIT: All other non-mining full nodes will not understand and validate until 95% anyways, I consider it _very_ dangerous if only mining nodes "validate".
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:28:33
I agree, the opinions that Bitcoin is gonna take over the world seems to be long gone, for better of worse...  
I think they've moved to Ethereum och some other alt-coin. It could also be because the hype has faded away, which _could_ have a positive outcome, but arguably it wasn't.
Personally, I just want an environment were people can tolerate and understand both views, but it's probably an impossible task at this time, given that lots of people seem to have a strict never-ever-hardfork belief.

The blocksize limit before the 1MB limit softfork was 32MB, because of constraints in Bitcoin's network transport layer.
AFAICT, it would techincally be possible create a bigger block than 32MB, but wouldn't be able to send it to other miners via the normal Bitcoin network.

I guess it doesn't really matter yes, as long people running more user friendly wallets and SPV-wallets update their wallets so they support and understand SegWit...  
But I guess it would be healthy if the full-nodes in the network understands SegWit transactions.
Old clients do not understand SegWit transactions (they're classified as "Anyone can spend" outputs), but they won't invalidate the transactions, hence SegWit is a soft-fork.

Yes... I know how the bitcoin protocol works.


Maybe, OP was talking about miners, but sure, fully validating peers could potentially benefit from a lower increment of the blockchain size. But I'm not sure if you really can assert this. I think the reason for the drop-off in validating nodes is mostly because web and SPV wallets exists, it's just more convenient. I don't think arbitrarily keeping the blocksize to 1MB (or lowering it) will help in any way.

Sigh... oh god no. I don't understand  why people continue to insist that sidechain is the best scaling solution (or a scaling solution at all). The user experience will be utterly _terrible_, the current approach requires coin lock for 1-2 days when moving coins to another channel. It's just not feasible.  
But perhaps atomic swaps in payment channels could work, but I'm not sure.
The main problem with bitcoin's blockchain (and all other blockchains for that matter) is that every node needs to have a copy of the whole chain in order to validate it's legitimacy. The natural approach on how to to fix this would be to work on ideas on how to implement _sharding_.


Have you read the LN white paper? You're ignorance is showing here. LN does a hell of a lot to help with scaling, in fact ~100MB blocks would provide utility for 7 billion people. Very risky (risky for centralization risk), but totally feasible today on a modern computer. If we expect that technology continues to get better, perhaps we should be able to safely deploy 100mb blocks within 15-30 years timeframe, enough time for complete worldwide adoption.
I don't know what you mean by "lock up thousands of dollars",  I assume you're referring to the locktime for releasing funds when settling a LN commitment transaction to the blockchain. Potentially a showstopper sure, but we haven't figured out an optimal delay to deploy here.
And while I guess you could argue that money is "tied up" in channels, there could be solutions for exit nodes (i.e a service by Coinbase/Shapeshift directly integrated into a wallet) to automatically craft LN -&gt; normal bitcoin on-chain transactions when needed.  
But if 90% of all transactions happen in LN, this would be lesser of a problem. 


Are you implying that it would only be a great solution for low value payments?  
I'm fairly confident that it will be great solution for &gt; $1 as well. The best solution we have today.


This is simply not true. It does exactly what it does. 1MB-&gt;2MB doubles the block size. It's not kicking the can down the read, it's opening the bitcoin network for more transactions.


Explain why it wouldn't.


Makes zero sense. Explain why.


I disagree. But perhaps you should go more into detail about those sidechains would work technically and in practice.  
Also, you do realize that near-trustless sidechains would require a softfork, which hasn't even been fully proposed yet?

Bitcoin Core is a set of people (anyone can actually contribute), but within this group there is a smaller set of people that has more privileges than the others. These people have direct commit access to the master branch of the git repository and decide what goes in the project. They have a democratic  process where a pull request requires a number of ACKs before it gets accepted.
So yes, one can definitely argue that there is a single entity that is "Core". Saying anything otherwise is just disingenuous.
Now, some people of Core joined the HK conference forming the HK agreement, they can still put up a pull request to the Bitcoin Core project.

I think it's wrong to say that a blocksize increase doesn't scale Bitcoin, in a sense it does... at least linearly.  
But it doesn't solve the Bitcoin's ability to scale _better_ - It doesn't change Bitcoin to utilize LN, mimblewimble 1-signature aggregation or any of that jazz, those things are being worked on in parallel with the blocksize debate.
But SegWit provides a path for all those technologies (at least LN and 1-signature aggregation if/once Schnorr is deployed).  
But there's nothing that says we won't need a hardfork blocksize increase in the future.

Anyway no I don't, what I do think though is that your position is premature, as I wrote in the [other thread]( having the inability to not fork should not rely on _social pressure_, it should rely on the actual infrastructure's inability to change. Given enough time, we will have enough full nodes, miners, wallets and other software/hardware that it will be practically impossible to make a hardfork/softfork (case in point: see all internet protocols ever made).
Your extremist position at this stage of time is doing nothing but fueling the fire. We have a shot in a 1-2 years timeframe in clearing up things before it gets practically impossible (because of the reason stated above) to do so, I for one welcome the hard work of Bitcoin Core (and others) so we can actually have a scalable and maintainable network that will not just crash and burn when the block reward gets lower and won't be able to sustain on transaction fees because of arbitrary limitations on the network.

That's a really weak argument, considering that SegWit will help with the progress towards making SPV more secure.


I read your blog post.  
My opinion is that the quote not really valid as it's completely taken out of context. He was against adding arbitrarily data on the blockchain, which makes sense. "Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale.".
AFAIK he has never said that he is strictly against increasing the block size, quite the opposite, he predicted a future where large server farms run nodes, and people are on SPVs.
Now it's possible to double-down on that argument again saying that SPVs are far from perfect, but I stand optimistic about SPVs future.

@_date: 2016-11-28 15:57:43
No, Satoshi's design was to give the nodes no _need_ to collaborate, because they've incentive to build upon the longest valid chain (as in valid for full nodes). The extreme difficulty for coordination that we're seeing (whether it is a soft or hardfork) is a result of the system's design.
If miners can cooperate to softlock a block limit while hardforking to x MB blocks knowing that none of the miners will mine such a big block until all full nodes have updated, Bitcoin is not a trustless system anymore. That's putting waaay too much abritrary trust in individual miners and mining pools. You put trust on miners not making a such block, effectively splitting upgraded and non-upgrades nodes.
You could argue that this is better than a non-graceful hardfork, but I disagree. Announcing and deploying a hardfork gives a clear message for nodes to either accept the changes or not.  
Personally I think the soft-hardfork proposal is the best forking solution.

No the cannot absolutely _not_ permanently tie your funds up, that would be insane. They do not have a real custodial ownership over the money relaying through their node. If a node is uncooperative, the money needs to settle on the blockchain, and that can take some time because of the lock time, which is unfortunate.

Yes, I'm the only one having pro-fork (non contentious) opinions. /s


There are already attack vectors _today_ that can DOS-attack the network. If you truly want Bitcoin to work, you must acknowledge this. (I'm talking about the quadratic sighash operation issue).  
Also, as you want Bitcoin to be a safe heaven, how do you feel about the visibility and tracking possibilities on the bitcoin network today? Sophisticated analysis tools are being built and _will be built_. Fungibility is one of the most important aspects of bitcoin.  
I think innovations such as confidential transactions, mimblewimble, LN (with onion routing) and other privacy enhancing features should excite you. They do require softforks.  
Many people are very worried about Bitcoins ability to survive if the blockchain is as transparent as it is today.
Bitcoin is _not_ good the way it is, so let me restate, it is immature to have strict no-fork position at this point of time. I DO agree with you on a philosophical level, immutability is arguably the most important aspect of Bitcoin, but it is not the only important aspect. And immutability should not and does not need to rely on social pressure.


Take a look at various internet protocols and other technologies. We have been trying to push for IPv6 for 20 years. The reason for IPv6 failure is not purely political, it's practical+technical. It's simply impossible to change the whole Internet ecosystem and infrastructure to IPv6. Other examples? TCP, Email, Printers.

This should stand as a clear example that a block size increase for bitcoin is _NOT_ comparable to Ethereums attempt to fix the DAO debacle. It just isn't fair. Both because the DAO hardfork clearly violates the ethos of a cryptocurrency and because it was rushed out.

Stop being so ignorant and listen to what gizram84 actually is saying, _there is no_ SegWit address that has been standardized.  
A proposal was referred. When SegWit activates, we'll use a hacky solution (P2WPKH nested in P2SH) until we get a new address format, but god knows when that will happen.

I think it kind of needs to, when miners reward go down, transaction fees need to pay up, which means we need more transactions, which should mean more users. If more users are in the system, the price must be higher because of the supply limit.

[I'm not entirely sure]( but quoting from Bitcoincore.org:


So each byte of a transaction would need the to be hashed at most twice, so it will be changed to linear.


Okay I did not know that. I don't understand how that would work though.  
I would still claim that MAST is easier to implement though, code is already ready to be implemented for it (from the BIP).

Payment channels* not Lighting.
But yes Satoshi definitely thought about payment channels, but his version was insecure, as it didn't rely on strict contract "rules", it relied on miners actually accepting the transaction with the highest nSeqeuence (miners could just put another old state instead to the blockchain), in other words, it wasn't a blockchain consensus rule and it's not possible to enforce that.
To circumvent that, what Lighting Network's payment channels do is to lock up the user funds with CHECKSQEUENCEVERIFY for a couple of days until the committer can claim the funds. If a user pushes an old channel state to the blockchain, an output spending for the user's funds has already been signed to let the counterparty take the user's money, hence the lock period of some days.
@_date: 2016-11-20 23:57:07


WTF, how is this a good thing? You do realize we eventually will need a hard fork to increase the 1M constant, if we want more people to use bitcoin. Sure Segwit gives some headroom.

@_date: 2016-11-21 21:35:25


I agree. I agree with the whole blog post.  
My issue is though that, just like with the internet, network protocols are really difficult to change/improve.
My fear is that, if we do do not increase the blocksize soon (1-2 years), we might never will be able to.  
It is next to impossible to even get anything near a consensus today, how will the situation be in 5 years?

LN is shit without a transaction malleability fix, ALL implementations of LN in development today rely on that it will activate on mainnet. You should be very worried about SegWit not getting activated, because it could mean that the development of bitcoin has stalled. Which is NOT good as we have lots of stuff coming up (MAST, Schnorr, 1-sig aggregation...).


What? The incentive for miners to mine blocks is to earn money. This is the essence of the whole system.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:44:29

The reason is that it's still a temporary fix.  
1.5 years ago, it was not just 2MB increase on the table, rather there were many proposals to increment the blocksize over time, both conservatively and aggressively.  
What Segwit's block size increase looks like is an attempt to shut the big blockers up.

I've enough technical experience with Segregated Witness to understand that it does change Bitcoin transactions.


You're saying that the fact that non-upgrading nodes cannot validate a (SegWit) transaction is not a big change?

As far as I can understand the system... yes. But don't take my word for it; it's the only thing that makes sense for me in my head.  
The commitment transaction has already been negotiated, so it needs to be redone, but more funds must be going into the commitment transaction, so maybe that should require more bitcoin into the funding transaction.

LN is nothing like the DAO. It's dishonest to compare the two. LN funds are locked up in normal multi-sig contracts. The only "new" potential risk would be HTLC's, which relies on a cryptographically secure random generated value (known in the paper as "R"), but the same applies to generating your private key in the app.
And AFAICT, there was custodial risk in the DAO, funds were put together in a honeyspot, in an unproven complex contract, which is possible to do in a flexible blockchain scripting language like Ethereum provides.


No, that's a normal payment channel, the idea with LN is that it's an interconnected network of payment channels, perhaps you should read more about the topic. There are several great videos on Youtube as well.


I agree, BTC debit cards are nothing like LN, other than that they both do not touch the blockchain so frequently.

The blocksize debate started long before Ethereum was even released. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 14:28:31
That's a very extreme generalization.  
It's not that black and white, and pro-bigger blocks people also emphasize on keeping decentralization. But they do not feel that a blocksize increase would necessarily centralize Bitcoin more.
 
Many people fear that we're missing opportunity by not increasing the blocksize, I don't know if that's true, personally my frustration stems from that there are no clear plan on the blocksize scaling. There are many ideas on how to improve other areas of scaling (Schnorr sig, MAST, LN/payment channels and more). But for me, none of these really matters if we're still stuck on a arbitrary constant limiting the network and the number of possible participants. We _need_ a dynamic or increasing blocksize.  
The reason why we've a split in the community comes from the communication issues from the Core team, they never really cared about the blocksize and still don't do. The debate has exhausted a many developers and will continue to do so.

It's not irrelevant, what kind of insane claim is this.  
_Put simply so there can be no misunderstanding_: If you use Lightning network, you have new attack vectors and security measures. Read the white paper if you don't understand what I'm talking about.


I'm fully aware of that layer 2 solution doesn't change anything about the underlying network, this was not my point!   
So yes, it doesn't enforce anything, but to make Lightning network work in practice, everyone needs to be using Lightning network, or proxies to it.

Yes I agree, it's not a "replacement", that wasn't what I meant to say.


I didn't say that it replaces the blockchain, I said on-chain transactions, meaning it supposed to practically change the way we transact.
@_date: 2016-12-01 09:53:50
With "almost instant" I mean it's probably not "lightning fast" (pun intended), because of network delay and other factors, but it's will most likely be practically instant. My guess it will be as fast as it takes to broadcast a bitcoin transaction over the bitcoin network, meaning a 0-conf transaction. With LN, this transaction will already be "confirmed", because the channel state have been renegotiated, and a channel party has no incentive to broadcast an old channel state to the blockchain, because they will be penalized (losing everything) for doing so.
With cooperative I mean that if your nearest counterparty stops responding, you'll be forced to settle your current channel state on-chain, which means that your funds will be locked up for X amount of time (I don't think the variable has been decided yet). This is a potential game breaker.  
But as long as everyone is acting well, LN will be buttery smooth.

They already do control the blocksize, they can mine blocks with 1 transactions (~1kb blocks) with no penalty (and even enforce this via a softfork), it's just that if they want to do a &gt; 1MB block, full nodes will invalidate their chain.

Hm do you have any source on this? Incoming funding already in LN should not need a settlement AFAICT(?), but from non-LN to LN, it would require some kind of record on the blockchain. The channel already opened should not need to be closed, but another one could be opened. I've yet to read the every page of whitepaper though.
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:42:33

Oh yeah? I can settle any payment channel or LN payment channel at any given time (when I have a channel open with another party).

Yeah it's completely delusional to think that is the case.
@_date: 2016-12-12 11:05:29


No, SW redefines how Transaction ID is counted/defined.  
To make it a soft-fork scriptSig (where signatures are placed today) will empty, and a new part of the transaction called "witness" will be used to place the signatures, this part will _not_ be counted towards the Transaction ID, hence why the transaction cannot be malleable by a third party anymore.
Witness is only seen by SegWit nodes, which is the reason why the SegWit softfork increases the effective blocksize.
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:20:57

This assumes that the miners are collaborating, which is something we do not ever want.
Logic for activation for a hardfork is definitely needed, personally I think just using BIP9 would be good enough, but it of course doesn't take full nodes/others than miners into account.

Harddisk to store the blockchain and network connection(s) are a tiny cost compared to the mining equipment needed for a mining operation.


Poor people will NOT mine bitcoin. Poor people, given that they're _poor_ cannot afford mining equipment. This has nothing to do with the blocksize.

@_date: 2016-12-02 23:49:17
I don't understand why you solely focus on the implementation, why wouldn't you comment about the BIP or the principle itself? Perhaps it is a bad idea to completely remake how the block header works, and be able to add arbitrary fields, who knows what different attack vectors that could open.  
I think you should comment on that instead of the implementation, the code needs to be properly tested and peer reviewed anyways to be merged into Bitcoin Core, right?

Waaay to strawman...  
No sane person has anything against Segwit, let alone Schnorr signatures or LN, it's just that it cannot be a full replacement for a blocksize increase.
EDIT: I wouldn't worry too much about Raiden, I would be surprised if it is anywhere near a mainnet release.
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:17:05
Nice, do you have the non-minified version public?
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:19:03
Because what OP is asking is why we don't change the 1000000 bytes per block constant as well as implementing Segregated Witness.  
SegWit offloads parts of the transaction (scriptSig) to a new data block (witness (block)) not seen by old clients (I refer this method as "extension blocks"), this effectively increases the number of "bytes" per block, as programmed in SegWit conforming clients.
In practice it would probably be about the same effect as changing the blocksize constant, given the simulations already done. Personally I think it has made understanding what the actual blocksize limit (post segwit) is very confusing.
Anyway personally I think it's better to wait until the SegWit soft forks succeeds (if that happens, that is) and then plan out a hard fork proposal, as per the HK agreement. If that doesn't happen I fear that the situation is going to get even more ugly than it already is.
@_date: 2016-11-28 12:36:45


How easy will this be? AFAIK there are no libraries available to easily construct the contracts/transactions (not to mention the code to operate as a lightning node), only the unfinished whitepaper and the different node implementations available.

We need a incremental blocksize or flexcap, so we never need to deal with this shit again.
@_date: 2016-12-12 18:55:20


Ugh..... I was kind of expecting this response. This _won't_ practically happen.  
Yes, I do have a full node with the whole blockchain and yes, I probably will monitor it myself (if the setup will be easy) but you cannot expect 100% of all other people to do this. As of today there are only ~5000 running full nodes.


I never said that there will be one giant organization that handles the channel monitor, but it definitely matters, because that's a single point of failure.  
And you're missing the point, you could go ahead and double-check if the service is monitoring, but it might not be a question if, but _when_ it stops monitoring.
So yes, I hope that there will be lots of different services that provides it, it's definitely needed.


I disagree that it would be the only issue.
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:03:20
People have short memory...
@_date: 2016-12-01 12:20:15


Because you can't, when you change the state of the channel, the old channel state (commitment transaction) will have an output signed by both parties ("breach transaction") that gives the other party all of the coins (both parties have a copy of the commitment transaction with the breach transaction giving money to the opposite party).  
There's a timelock to receive your funds of a commitment transaction, so basically if someone tries to fraud you by broadcasting an old state, you've X amount of time (maybe 2-3 days) to put forth your breach transaction that will penalize your counterparty by claiming their funds. This is the essential part that makes payment channels work.

@_date: 2016-12-13 10:58:31
Well, LN is a layer upon bitcoin, it doesn't change anything about Bitcoin itself. It just uses normal Bitcoin scripts already possible to do today.   We just need a transaction malleability fix to be able to make it secure. Our best shot for the moment being is the Segregated Witness softfork.

@_date: 2016-12-14 17:41:53
Yes, we kind of need new address formats, but a proposal for this was deferred. Until we have new address formats for Segwit transactions, there are two ways of doing Segwit transactions:
* Payment protocol, using the payment protocol, we could circumvent using an address, works fine for purchases via Bitpay/Coinbase.
* P2WPKH nestled inside a P2SH address (starting with 3), this is what wallets will use for now.
@_date: 2016-12-04 10:57:00

2. The graph looks exponential because of the growth Bitcoin has had over the time. It won't be exponential anymore, rather linear, because of the 1MB blocksize cap.

@_date: 2016-12-04 11:14:30






For the 1000nth time, Ethereum's hardfork was stressed out without a clear consensus from the community, planned 3-4 days beforehand.  
If Bitcoin is having hardfork it will most likely be 1+ years before activating, with a requirement of 95%+ block support from miners. Do you honestly think another chain will have any chance surviving? Not to mention exchange support is needed.


There will be no old original chain if the hardfork is made correctly.

@_date: 2016-11-24 00:15:38
I haven't read much of the Segwit. I've mostly a high-level understanding of the design of Segwit, I've read the BIPs as well.
I consider it a hack because arbitrarily data will be added as input (as a far as I can tell?) of the coinbase transaction, which has no consensus rules for old clients, making it a soft fork.  
The clean way would be to just have this witness merkle tree data as a new field in the block header, but that would make it a hard fork. So to circumvent having a hard fork, it was added to the coinbase transaction. I consider that to be a hacky solution. It's not a very nice way of structuring things.
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:57:33

@_date: 2016-12-02 21:11:09
There really isn't one, it's mostly a no-brainer. I'm two things:
* I want SegWit as a hardfork. I don't want the technical debt of having the witness commitment inside the coinbase transaction, instead of a clean implementation in the block header.  
AFAICT, there are already too many gotchas in Bitcoin.
* The [block weight thingy]( seems purely arbitrary. I haven't seen any reason for why it is Blocksize * 3 + Blocksize.  
I know we're creating a block weight variable to disincentive UTXO spamming. I just find it frustrating that this is arbitrarily without a valid reasoning, _especially_ when all the blocksize proposals gets a lot of heat and requirements to be rational.
Oh... and that Script only can be upgraded 16 times (probably because of the numeric op-codes goes from OP_0 to OP_16) is kind of worrisome, but I suppose that we'll get a new Scripting language before that happens.

By this logic, it wouldn't matter anyways with LN, because the blocksize would still fill up, but then it's even more dangerous, because it's absolutely critical that reclaim transactions gets to the blockchain if a breach transaction gets to the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:49:00

Why? It's very uncertain that anyone would benefit for having a node in LN. It will be even more competitive than mining (which is nearly impossible to be profitable in) because all you need is a decent computer and not so shitty internet connection.  
I think the fees will go towards zero.
Also, I want to point out that Lightning Network was first proposed (though ideas had been floating around for while) 1.5 years after the first Blockstream (and their sidechains plan) announcement went public.


Yes I agree that it could potentially be a conflict of interest, and I'm mad about it too. But it doesn't need to be negative; many Red Hat devs contribute directly to the Linux kernel.  
But in this case, I'm not seeing it.

Honest question, how long have you following bitcoin?


Because it has not been practically viable. That is the reason. And it's still unclear if it is practically viable now, even with LN!
CLTV, CSV and BIP68 was activated just a year ago. SegWit for transaction malleability fix is still not deployed.


It will of course give less incentive, but a second layer should be good enough to incentivize users to use it anyways, to forced upon them

Absolutely not, Schnorr signature verification needs a soft fork to add new op-code.
The Schnorr implementation was dropped from libsecp256k1 because it had some issues (I guess sipa is working on reimplementing it again?), so AFAICT, Bitcoin Core doesn't have a signature verification lib to be used for Schnorr signatures.

Dishonest comment.
It was blocksize hardfork versus SegWit, in which SegWit was considered more complex.
No one has ever argued that SegWit is more complex than Bitcoin Unlimited.
@_date: 2016-12-12 22:42:45


It fundamentally changes many things.  For example, both parties need to be online when the trade happens and you (or someone you outsourced to) actively need to monitor the blockchain to watch for old channel states being broadcasted.  
I don't see how you can argue against that.

Nice, you're doing amazing work already! :)


Sure, I won't refute that new users pick up the Bitcoin address system quickly, but we need to start thinking about solutions on how to make sending transactions it more intuitive.  
BIP70 helps, but the transaction log in wallets are often still a mess, even though you send via BIP70 (IIRC it's the same for CoPay, so that's something you could look into (i.e showing "Acme Inc." if you sent to Acme via BIP70).  
I know it's not the best analogy, but I see bitcoin addresses like IP-addresses, we're all really dependent on it, but if we browse to  DNS will resolve the domain for us.
As an example, I think it would be so much better if I could send money to satoshi.nakamoto instead of having to input the bitcoin address.  
I know that this is a really difficult problem to solve because there a lot of difficult trade-off between privacy, security, censorship. I'm aware of all the BIPs, and I find BIP75 to be most promising, despite all the hate that it has had.

Peer-to-peer refers to the network topology, where transactions are broadcasted in a decentralized matter across the network (and again once a block is found).
Lightning Network has its own peer-to-peer network for broadcasting transactions/channel updates for its nodes, but the transactions themselves are bound in 2-party channels, but routed across many interconnected channels.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:44:37

I'll give your 4 different choices (all mobile wallets):
* [Samourai Wallet]( -- SPV wallet, privacy focusing wallet, mediocre UI [supports SegWit]
* [GreenAddress/GreenBits]( -- SPV wallet, mediocre UI [supports SegWit]
* [Bread]( -- SPV wallet, clean interface and is easy to use [doesn't not support SegWit yet]
* [CoPay]( -- relies on 3rd party server, also has a clean interface and is easy to use.  
If you want to buy many Bitcoins, you can also set up something called a "multisig" wallet, meaning that you can require for example 2 of your devices to sign a transaction (kind of like 2-factor authentication). [doesn't not support SegWit yet]
About SegWit; it is an upgrade to the Bitcoin network that let's you send transactions cheaper, not all wallets support it yet.

Good point, I've edited the post. The ones I listed were mobile wallets which are either "SPV wallets" (a light mode node, that trusts the chain with the most hashpower and does not not fully validate the blockchain) or relies on a 3rd party server.
If you want to have a full node, you'll need a computer for that. I recommend running [Bitcoin Core]( which is basically the backbone of the Bitcoin network right now, it has an very good track record.  
Many mobile wallets (e.g bread) let's you hook up a remote full node. I recommend doing this if you are tech savvy.  
There's nothing wrong with storing your Bitcoins directly on Bitcoin Core though.


The wallet will most likely tell you that it's a full node. You do not need to worry about this.


A hot wallet means a device that is connected to the Internet (like your mobile phone etc). This can be dangerous if you have many Bitcoins, you usually don't want to store lots of Bitcoin on a  internet connected device.  
A cold wallet is offline, usually on a piece of paper or on something called a "hardware wallet" (which is a secure device storing the Bitcoins).

Oh yeah re-enabling the OP-codes would certainly be nice, and also possible now with Witness Script versioning. 
You said "Etherum-like capabilities" though -- the thing that differ between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that in Ethereum you have access to the full blockchain (i.e you can check information on other contracts) and are not isolated to the contracts themselves, whereas as in Bitcoin, the transactions only know about themselves and you can't get information about any other transaction/UTXO in the blockchain.

BIP9 arguably put trust, faith and (perceived) power on miners that they never asked for, for the sake of convenience for coordinating a softfork. We must start looking for other ideas on how to deploy softforks.


See P2SH softfork deployment.

SegWit is well tested. What do you think are the risks?
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:18:31


Unnecessarily​ complex.


Unnecessary hardfork at this time.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:27:25
Because old nodes would follow the UASF-chain if it would become the longest.
Hardfork means that old nodes would not follow the longest chain with new rules, like Bitcoin Unlimited/Emergent Consensus.
Just because UASF can lead to a chainsplit doesn't mean it's a hardfork.

If we just get 50+% signaling support, a UASF is much safer.  
Jihan/Antpool will most likely never signal for Segwit unless by pressure, but all other miners should signal as it's in their own best interest​.
@_date: 2017-04-28 21:41:03


Maybe they weren't aware that SegWit would block Asicboost, then they tested AsicBoost on testnet (as they already confirmed doing) and realized it didn't work.

Tell me one bug that by the use of OpenSSL is affecting Bitcoin Core.
As you know, the unwritten rule of security 101 is to *not* come up with own implementations of things.  
But sure, I would like to point out though that the libsecp256k1 *might* is justified because it has been heavily tested and years old now.
I just find it unbelievably ironic that while at one hand, you (Core) is advising against a Hard Fork because of security risks, and on the other you're is implementing own security solutions.

I've looked at the SegWit code myself in the Bitcoin Core pull request, I did not find it *that* easy. But sure, I trust wallet developers and they really know better than me.
And I'm not talking about complexity when I'm comparing it with BIP70 - I'm referring to wallet devs laziness in developing new features.  
One could say that BIP70 and SegWit transactions/addresses are not comparable though, because SegWit is much more important because of fixing the transaction malleability fix.

This requires that nodes actually upgrade as well. There are no new constraints on the network if no nodes upgrade to the ext block.

Do you seriously believe that big block supporters would not support innovations such at CT? There's no cognitive dissonance.
The polarization has come to be because of the lack of concrete answers for the block size increase - and this has been going on for years, not just 0.5-1 year.  
This stress people out, and considering that many Core developers are in contract with Blockstream, there's valid reasons to raise suspicions of Conflict of interest.

Well, Steam accepting bitcoin is actually a great example of Bitcoin use.
Do you save your Credit Card on Steam?  


Yes it will give money to BitPay and yes it might be a valid argument that it is a bit redundant with conversions all over the place, but it needs to be bootstrapped in some way, and I think this is a good start. It is not fair to expect everyone and companies to just jump in to BTC-only directly, and I don't understand why that needs to be the case.
Also, just want to point out that PayPal and Credit cards take a lot higher transaction fees than BitPay ever does.


Well... I don't think this is the case, but it is my hope, that paying for an item in DOTA2 or CSGO will be doable without loading a balance to your Steam account with Bitcoin - making an micro-transaction essentially. That would be a huge improvement IMO.  
It is not possible today with Credit cards because they take such a big cut so it won't be worth it for small purchases.

A larger blocksize puts pressure on hardware. While the number of full nodes could increase given more adoption, if I as a normal bitcoin user can't or can't afford to run a fullnode at home, I think the project has severely failed.    
Having lots of fullnodes in datacenters means nothing really.


While I do agree that the fees are too high, I think it's naive to think that decentralization would be cheap. Our best bet is to use Bitcoin and its blockchain in the most efficient way possible - whatever that is LN or Schnorr sigs/MAST/1sig aggregation or both I don't really care.  
I don't believe in simply increasing the blocksize, but it will definitely be needed in the future anyways.


I'm fairly sure that almost all devs want to see a long-term solution to the blocksize, such as an incremental/flexible one. There are several proposals out there. Patience.


Come on... Cannot the blockstream core conspiracy die already?

It's not an odd trade-off, and it's rather perverse that think it's okay that anyone is getting double spent.
In any critical system, in the case a system error, it's preferred to shutdown the system, rather than try to continue to run in an unsafe state. This applies very much to bitcoin as well.

The thing is... if we want to trigger 80% of the network nodes that already has BIP9 segwit signaling, we need to do it fairly soon, otherwise we must deploy a completely new segwit softfork.
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:07:08


No you don't _need_ it.
Should (50+%) miners be stupid enough to not signal segwit when UASF goes live, old clients (including non-UASF SegWit clients) will follow the other chain causing a chainsplit.
51% miner support is preferable though yes.

You cannot know that. I actually think it's not that black and white, I think much of the price is actually backed up by the utility of Bitcoin. Statistically, the volatility is lower now than what it has historically been, and the price don't fluctuate like it used to anymore.


I absolutely think there's a need for payment channels in a network.
Things like Satoshidice, video streaming "pay per second", brick-and-mortar purchases could benefit or is simply impossible without payment channels
@_date: 2016-09-01 08:01:28


Well, how can you claim _this_? What is a lie?
The max block size limit was a temporary fix for preventing possible DDoS attacks from a malicious miner just spamming the network with transactions.


I haven't seen this conversation but it seems like Satoshi was aware of that a hardfork should be planned in for (i.e after block X) while Garzik suggested to just increase it - in the early days Satoshi knew this was a bad idea as he had much more knowledge of the system than anyone else.
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:08:53


I'm fully aware of that, but I do not see a sidechain as Bitcoin. It will certainly not be frictionless. It's just a bad argument in my opinion: "Need feature X? It can exist in a sidechain!".
Now with LN coming up, having something less than a satoshi might actually become useful.


Lol that's an interesting idea.

It has definitely stagnated, and now with 0-conf proven insecure, we should really wait for LN and see if brick-and-mortar purchases can work.
It seems like the bitcoin community is focusing on developing other services and things that the normal system cannot provide, which is exactly where the focus should be. It's _hard_ competing against an established system.
Edit: If you mean online stores, I really don't understand it either - it shouldn't be so hard to just plug in BitPay/Coinbase/Snapcard or any of the other bitcoin payment processors. But I'm not that knowledgeable in that area so I don't really know if it's a hassle.

Indeed, now we know how to _not_ do a hard fork, not that we should not do it.


AFAIK, this is not true at all. The anti-hard forkers had just started to mobilize, there were not an unanimous consent on the hard fork, so many things happened on the day-to-day basis that it was extremely hard to keep up. All of sudden a new update to geth was up.


This is not a perfect excuse for a hard fork, and if you think, I think you should think about what Bitcoin and blockchain is one more time. A hard fork is not a good argument to make a rollback, and the Bitcoin community know this. We didn't hard fork in 2013 when MtGox happened, we didn't hard fork in 2015 when Bitstamp got hacked, we didn't hard fork now when Bitfinex got hacked.  
Yes I know that the DAO is different than an exchange, money got stolen nonetheless.


Did I say that?  
Let me answer by asking a question back, Do you think it will always be a contentious issue to increase the block size? Because I think not - when shit hits then fan, we will need to increase the block size, and miners will agree.  
Meanwhile I'll be enjoying SegWit.
Edit: it's beside the point but I think a hard fork with a majority would have a lesser chance of having a split, as the difficulty retargeting takes two weeks, which means that a minor chain having ~5% hashing power would have significant delays over a long period of time.

Yeah, really.




 
So you're claiming there is no risk?  
A fraudulent player takes a lot of risk and it's probably against his own best interest to play bad because he has a high chance of losing everything. _But_ that doesn't mean that LN "100% secure", it's disingenuous and dishonest to claim that.

I don't know if you intentionally are trying to miss the point.
Everyone in the world is not using the Internet, actually it's around 40% of the world population.


What I'm trying to say is that Bitcoin does _not_ need billions of user to be a global economy, quite frankly it just needs a couple of millions, or tens of millions.  
Bitcoin might will scale to billions of users, but that won't happen until maybe 20 years.

Some questions about SegWit script versioning, [BIP141]( states the following:




Does this mean that when upgrading Script, we do not need to rely on the NOP-codes at all and can create completely new arbitrary OP codes that do not have the same disadvantages as the NOP-codes? In other words, we're not limited to only be able to add 8 new OP-codes (replacing the NOP-codes)?
Also, I can make a pull request - but shouldn't the text say "for 0 to 15" instead of "for 0 to 16"? 1 byte cannot represent the number 16.
Another note, [BIP142]( also describes a (new) witness program versioning on the actual witness bitcoin addresses, I guess these are completely unrelated to the scriptPubKey*/reedemScript versions?
By the way, do we already have any plans on how to have new versions when version 15 has been reached? I guess that version 15 could let the second byte have the special meaning of describing the Script version (16-30).
@_date: 2016-09-08 08:08:57

I really like BIP47 and I've used it in Samourai wallet, but despite all the shit BIP75 has gotten, I think it's really cool and superior.  
I think it all comes down to,  
Do we do this on the Bitcoin blockchain?  
Or do we do it as a "layer-2" approach?  
As far as I understand BIP75, it will ultimately make Bitcoin transactions more like how it works with emails, I foresee these "Store and Forward" servers acting like email service providers, but working in a trustless and private manner. I really like that it extends BIP70 as well.  
Please read the [BIP]( it's quite informative.
I cannot wait until using BIP75 in breadwallet, keep up the good work guys.
^(Yes I think the KYC-concerns are extremely exaggerated.) 
Regarding BIP47, this is a game-breaker for me:


AFAIK it isn't really _needed_ it's just that if there isn't a notification transaction, restoration of the wallet wouldn't be possible and you would lose your funds.
@_date: 2016-09-13 08:45:53
Well payment channels/LN could potentially make double-spending 0-conf impossible. Not "impossible" but you're a fool if you try it, as with LN case you'll possibly lose all your funds if you try to broadcast an old transaction.
The bitcoin network itself benefits from Satoshidice using payment channels/LN because it won't spam the network with small payouts all the time.

Lightning network transactions are just normal bitcoin transactions.
Bitcoin transactions can be signed and forwarded to someone else to broadcast - which is the case with for example hardware wallets.  
You trust other parties to actually broadcast the transaction though.
[A BIP-standard and protocol is also in the works for detached signing](
EDIT:  Another note, regarding internet connection, Bitcoin P2P layer is _currently_ bound to the Internet, but it doesn't necessarily need to. What really matter is the blockchain and the blockchain is network-layer agnostic.

You can't have the cake and it eat to. Ultimately we will need to do trade-offs. Losing decentralization is irrecoverable and without decentralization we won't have sound money. Fees are a temporary pain that we have to deal with, it's not permanent (hopefully).
I am not willing to trade decentralization to be able to do small transactions in the short term.
I am however willing to trade low fees for smaller fees in the short to mid-term. It requires us to come up with efficient and workable solutions (onchain scaling by Schnorr sigs, trying out LN, MAST, etc), just kicking the can down the road by increasing the blocksize is not the appropriate way to fix this.


Micropayments have _never_ worked. A plausible solution is Payment channels, which might will be fulfilled in practice by the Lightning Network. A coffee purchase is not a microtransaction.
It sucks that Bitcoin is not suitable for normal day-to-day purchases anymore, that is why I am looking into improving the situation by helping the Lightning community, and also improving the wallet situation in general.  
Increasing the blocksize by trading decentralization is a non-negotiable thing for me.  
Decentralization **must** prevail.

I am perfectly fine with the current situation because I understand that (maintaining) decentralization has a high cost.

@_date: 2017-09-05 10:47:56
You do not understand, I do not want to risk Bitcoin's security just because some new users want to buy Coffee with Bitcoin. Today there are better alternatives out there. Bitcoin was never about that, Bitcoin is about trustless, finite/inflation-free, sound money.


What makes you think other cryptos won't face the exact same problems that Bitcoin faces? They will! And Bitcoin actually scales _far better_ than the popular alternatives (Ethereum, Monero, Zcash etc).
It seems like you think that there is not trade-off here, but there undoubtedly is. If we would increase the blocksize, we increase the workload of the system.

No, we have been saying that Ethereum's smart contracts are useless _relatively to Bitcoin_.
We have always argued that Bitcoin has smart contracts, because it has.
Simplicity provides a way to make more complex/flexible contracts that also are more secure by providing formal verifiability of the code. It makes it easier to reason about the contract.
Solidity/Ethereum provides a way to make insecure contracts that look like horseshit, and provides almost no benefits.

As already pointed out to you you, Blockstream is not Core, and neither Blockstream nor Core (what is "Core" btw?) owes you an explanation or a blocksize increase.
And as Gregory Maxwell has pointed out for you, Blockstream as well as developers of the Bitcoin project/Core have been constantly scaling bitcoin _for years_. The most recent one being SegWit, which also is a blocksize increase.


This is concern trolling:

There are many different ideas on how to implement out there.
Johnson Lau has his own variant and I heard some rumors that some are working on implementing MAST in a completely new scripting language (remember, we can replace "Bitcoin Script" in the future, with help from SegWit).
I don't know which proposal will win.

I apologize if that's the case, I did not mean to pull a straw man. I don't know in what context this quote is from but this is what I was referring to: 


I rather decide myself where I post until I get a ban. It's sad that this dismissive attitude is spreading like wildfire in this subreddit.


Right, I do now understand more what you were meaning and why you saw Bitcoin as uninteresting on first encounter.
My point in the first place was that given the exact quote from the Coindesk interview, I think the skepticism is shown in the quote that this thread is about. I don't think we should have a such skeptic attitude against Bitcoin is a payment network. Hopefully Lightning Network will be proven successful though, if not, I don't think we should have a skeptic attitude against scaling on-chain.


I don't agree that my account age on reddit has any relevance at all, I could have a 7+ years old account for all you know. It's just that I don't use it anymore.
But yes you're right, I wouldn't count myself as a super early adopter, although probably earlier than ~75% of people in this subreddit.
@_date: 2016-10-21 17:44:22
Terrible idea... Why?
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:42:09
Right, it gets a bit more complex. Shouldn't it still be possible (with softfork) to prevent new P2PKH's to the UTXO? I understand that existing transactions still needs to be spent as non-segit P2PKH.


They do though, for example Low S and NULLDUMMY will consensus rules for new transactions (both on segwit and non-segwit), bundled together with the SegWit softfork.
@_date: 2016-10-16 22:13:46
With all due respect, it's funny that it comes from Peter Wuille, as SegWit will have a discount system which will change the economics of Bitcoin. 
I don't remember exactly how it works because it's so complex.
@_date: 2016-10-17 08:21:12


I love how people always scream "rbtc" as soon as someone with seemingly controversial opinion comments. Go ahead an see my comment history on how often I am on rbtc. I haven't checked the subreddit for several weeks. Also, I'm not sure how that is relevant or contributes to the discussion, other than try to shame me(?).


I'm confident on what I was saying is right, with SegWit, there's a discount on the witness data, effectively changing the economics of Bitcoin.
We do not know the actual impact of this yet, but from what I see, it disincentives creating a transaction with many UTXOs. 


Link me one of those, I've never ever seen one.
Look I'm not saying Segwit is bad, or trying to keep the UTXOs small is bad through economic incentive, what gets me mad is the apparent double standards from Wuille here. You cannot claim one thing and at the same time do the opposite.

It's more like what Core did and accomplish wasn't politically loaded back then. Everyone was happy with the changes, because, albeit really good, they were trivial.  
But saying that "The Core" didn't exist is just plain wrong. Bitcoin Core _rebranded_ as Bitcoin Core to make a statement that they are a development team and that they do not own Bitcoin, because it was causing confusion.
But let me reiterate.


Uhm yes, like any other open source project...  
This doesn't mean that they do not have a Project maintainer (Wladimir) or people with ACK-decision and commit access.


With your reply, it seems you are the one having problems with decentralized process, should you be against other Bitcoin full-node projects.

@_date: 2016-10-28 13:56:34


Which is clearly a lie.
It doesn't require so much computer science or programming experience to understand that Segregated Witness in its most fundamental level _is_ a more complex solution.
Blocksize increase in its most fundamental level requires a constant change in the code and code for triggering the change. The _political_ and _practical_ impact is another matter though, because the topic has become so controversial.
Segregated witness requires software to change how transactions how handled, with new logic and rules. It has been well thought out and tested, but it's not entirely impossible we might see a bug.


Perhaps you would like Bitcoin Core to be closed source? Otherwise I don't understand your whining.

I agree it is silly to market it like that, but what they're trying to say is that it's _much_ more simple than SegWit.

It's handled by Unicode, a standards body for letters and symbols. The Bitcoin symbol was accepted in 2015 (or maybe even early 2014, I don't remember exactly), but has yet to be included in a revision.
Apple decided to add it in anyways, and did so by including it in a font for their operating system, I'm not entirely sure how macOS handles it, but I think they have a  font that covers a lot of different kinds of unusual Unicode symbols, as well as emojis.

Take into consideration that Zander is from a arguably competing dev team, which I believe will mean that the dev mailing list show bias against him.  
But why don't you yourself explain why flexible transactions would not have any merit? I've already read the proposal months ago.

@_date: 2016-10-27 13:01:47


Such an incredibly arrogant attitude. It _is_ a complex implementation because it's a softfork, it relies on arbitrary witness commitment in the coinbase transaction, which adds _technical debt_. Instead of doing it the clean way, of adding a new field to the transaction (which would be a hardfork), we're now relying on this behavior for the convenience of interoperability (softfork), with non-upgraded nodes which won't be able to validate segregated witness transactions in the first place anyways.
I'm all for doing it this way IF we hardfork away it in the future. But hardforking has become such a toxic topic because of people's egos that I quite frankly think we will never have be able to have a hardfork.


Albeit it was over a year ago, it kind of was... SegWit was presented at the scaling bitcoin conference last year, and later in the beginning of 2015 pursued as scaling solution because of Luke's finding of making it a softfork. It completely sidetracked the whole block size scaling discussion that was going on.
Or let me give you an example, how well discussed with the community was the completely arbitrary discount system of [segwit transactions](
Also, AFAIK people from the hardfork/bigger block camps have always been against Segwit as a softfork, it's nothing that has popped up recently which you seem to be implying.


I agree.  
AFAIK, It has been made though, in the Elements Project.  
Thomas Zander has made an alternative proposal in the form of "Flexible Transactions", consensus seems to be that the specification and implementation proposals are not very well done at the moment though.


It really sucks for everyone in the space. Had Core  taken a better stance and non-shallow against the block size debate and if this subreddit mods wouldn't taken such a hostile censoring stance against "alt coins/Bitcoin XTs hardfork proposal", I think all of this could be neglected.

BIP148 is unnecessarily aggressive/coercive (BIP149 is probably better), but BIP148 _will_ happen_. It's better to still support BIP148 if you like UASF, otherwise a failed BIP148 will be used as a weapon against UASFs in general.

Many people are frustrated that SegWit is not a hardfork instead. Now I'm no expert in SegWit but AFAIK a commitment of the witness merkle tree must be included for every block.  
Doing this the clean way would require a hard fork, but Core devs opted to push the data in to a scriptPubKey of the coinbase transaction of a block, making it completely backwards-compatible, but arguingly adding more complexity, ugliness and technical debt.

But that's not to say blockchain cannot work without bitcoin/altcoin (whatever you want to call it), you just must find another way to give miners incentive to mine, other than to receive coins. I highly doubt we will see a such system though.

This is not true. SegWit has nothing to do with smart contracts.
It could enable it in the future but that requires a fork as well.

Sure, I agree. I don't know how this is related to the discussion though.
was suggesting that the utility of "the blockchain" can be separated from bitcoin because "there are a myriad of existing blockchains that don't rely on bitcoin"  &amp;nbsp;- &amp;nbsp;my point is that it is completely irrelevant because it's still gives miners the same type of incentive as bitcoin would do. If you want to separate the blockchain from a token, you must find another type of incentive for the miners to mine, whatever that might be or if it's even possible is left to see.
To further clarify, when banks and non-techy people are talking about "Blockchain but not bitcoin", they're not meaning the use of an altcoin, they're talking about completely stripping out the concept of a coin.

Oh yes, I've read about Johnson's MAST proposal and I love it. If that's what you meant you should have said it in the first place. I agree it's undoubtedly really cool.
As said, I fail to see how it really replaces a turing complete scripting language for the blockchain, from what I can see and correct me if I'm wrong, MAST will mostly help to create arbitrarily big scripts, but won't bloat the blockchain as only the valid paths will need to be stored.  
It's far better than what Ethereum has accomplished, but it seems like we'll still need to create OP-codes as we need them.

I think the conflict is mostly based on fear of the ground layer becoming stagnant. Don't forget that it's a P2P network protocol. If we don't come to an agreement for the next 5 years, I don't believe we'll ever have any chance to increase the block size.
I don't think any reasonable person thinks we can scale to server 7G people _today_.
But to answer your thread title 


It's possibly better transacting on LN, because of benefits such as insta-transactions and microtransactions.  
But it gets a lot of backlash because LN is ultimately an unproven system, it seems like it will, but we do not know if it will really work out practically due to both social and technical factors.

Check here: 


That is for a UASF, I thought we were strictly talking about SegWit itself.


SegWit fixes a problem on how signature hashing is calculated. There are some serious bugs with the multisig OP-code that makes signature validation for specially crafted transaction scripts really really slow.
SegWit manages to fix this without hardforking because old nodes cannot fully validate SegWit transactions (because of SegWit is a softfork) (they can still validate things such as that input/output matches, but not signatures).


LN is an application of Bitcoin, preventing this would only make Bitcoin lose market share to other coins, which at least IMO would be far worse than anything else.
I also want to stress out that LN absolutely depends on on-chain transactions and miners.

Why do you think BIP148 is superior to BIP149?
Using BIP8 would prevent the unnecessary disrution caused by forcing 100% of miners to versionbit signal for Segwit in the end of the period (as in BIP148).
As Segwit doesn't require you to do mine segwit blocks, non-upgraded miners could just continue as they normally would do, and segwit miners could do segwit blocks.  
For those who haven't seen BIP8:

80% of the full nodes and support from the vast majority of the ecosystem, that's the problem here really? SegWit with directly increase to 2MB blocks, but it won't take that long time, considering the interest for cheap transactions.  
Also a 2MB blocksize without requiring SegWit is _extremely_ dangerous as the sighash scaling issue isn't solved for old transactions.




Yeah... hardforks require everyone to upgrade, otherwise they cannot use bitcoin (once a &gt;1MB block has been mined).
Perhaps I'm narrow minded. I don't understand why someone would not want to implement/use SegWit (transactions).
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:44:36


So why aren't you talking to Gavin then? I don't get your point.


Again, this is not constructive.


There's a clear distinction. If miners would hardfork without any full node support, they would not get paid.


They can choose to ignore it if they don't want to get paid, which is completely irrational.

 also shows companies that have no interest in running fullnodes, so it's very disingenuous to only count those who says they "support" segwit, rather than support+those who actually have implemented it (which is 90% under weighted mode).

All we want is for miners to respect​ our new subset of rules, if some miners  do not want to make Segwit blocks, they don't need to.
Segwit is opt-in on so many levels, it just need some coordination (which is BIP9 right now) for nodes to deploy it.

Nonsense! They are goalshifting every god damn time.  
Also SegWit2x is _NOT_ HK agreement.
SegWit2x would mean blocksizes up to 8MB, while HK agreement would have max 4MB blocks (same cap as Segwit but 2MB output data is allowed, which would make it likely to have full 4MB blocks).

No, BIP148 uses one type of UASF, a unconventional one.
Normal UASF would just be flag-day activation of a softfork.
BIP148 forces miners to signal for SegWit to make old non-BIP148 nodes that supports SegWit BIP9 deployment to still activate SegWit.

It becomes practically impossible to take advantage of Asicboost if this consensus rule is deployed.

If &amp;lt;50% upgrade, BIP149 would split the network

If a non-SegWit miner include a SegWit transaction that includes an invalid signature, they have messed up, because nodes that understand SegWit would reject it.
But non-SegWit miners wouldn't include the transaction, unless they intentionally want to mess up and lose money.

Go to Ripple if you want to rely on this weird non-working consensus system.

He was never expelled from Core, the other developers thought his original (20MB block) proposal was too aggressive, and now in retroperspective it looks like they were right. Full 20MB blocks means 1TB increase every year. That's completely insane for me.
When the other developers didn't agree to his proposal, he attempted to use his status in the community to take control over the project together with bitcoin developer Mike Hearn. They used Mike's alternative bitcoin client "Bitcoin XT" for this.
Now, doing software forks is nothing unusual in the open source world, the problem is that bitcoin requires absolute consensus between all network nodes, therefore it isn't as easy as creating an incompatible fork. A hardfork can be outrageous.


XT has some other features as well, I don't remember what though. XT was/is Mike Hearn's project.


I believe that SegWit is the best way forward, first as an immediate blocksize increase and then in the near future with improvements such as Schnorr signatures, signature aggregation and MAST.  
These improvement can increase throughput without increasing the blocksize, but they require SegWit first as SegWit makes it easier to upgrade the scripting language of Bitcoin.
For me it's a no-brainer if we can increase throughput to 12TPS with Schnorr sigs instead of doing a blocksize hardfork increase to 8MB (hypothetical, I don't know the exact numbers).
After we've done all the easy improvements I think it makes sense to work on and do a blocksize hardfork, one that increases the blocksize over time and/or flexcap.

Yes, exactly.  
SegWit only fixes the sighash calculation for SegWit transactions, I am unsure if there's an easy fix for old legacy transactions - I'm pretty sure it would require a hardfork though.
In a blocksize increase (meaning output data over 1MB), we would need to limit the outputs to be only segwit transactions over the 1MB limit to be safe.
Best would be to just forbid new legacy outputs altogether but many would probably argue that it's censorship and not right.

I suspect we'll never have a BIP9 softfork again.
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:45:53
BIP149 will activate SegWit on a set date, for all updated nodes.
Miners are then free to do SegWit blocks or not (as SegWit itself is not mandatory).
In order to cause disruption, miners need to mine illegal SegWit transactions, but SegWit transactions are non-standard for not upgraded nodes (and so they won't mine them).  
Old nodes would happily accept those illegal SegWit transactions as they do not understand SegWit, therefore a chainsplit is possible if less than 50% of the miners run BIP149.  
If more than 50% run BIP149, the rest of the miners would see their blocks being orphaned.
Miners need to actively work against the network and disrupt it for any harm to be made, this is not the case with BIP148 which absolutely mandates all miners to signal for SegWit activation.
If a node deployment goes as fast as with the current SegWit, we would see around ~80% node support after 6 months. I would assume that many exchanges/services/wallets would've updated their client at that point, so for a miner to want to split the network and therefore risk not being able to exchange their bitcoin for dollars, it seems like they must act irrational and against their best interest.

He has contributed a lot code and was very important for bitcoin's development.
Nowadays he is spreading FUD and misinformation on Twitter.
He for example claimed that Ethereum had no problem doing (equivalent of) a blocksize increase in their blockchain.  
I think this pretty dishonest considering:  
1. Doing a full sync of the Ethereum blockchain is already practically impossible for normal users at home  
2. Ethereum is arguably more centralized than bitcoin (as well as a smaller ecosystem).
I guess you know all about his attempt to fork the network with BitcoinXT.  
This was a very hostile and potentially dangerous hardfork that did not have unanimous support across the ecosystem. While doing a hardfork we must take extreme caution.
(disclaimer: I supported XT back in 2015 and I do support bigger blocksizes via a hardfork)

No, there are ways to mitigate that.
Lets say we introduce a new rule that makes _new_ legacy UTXOs invalid.
nLockTime'd transactions will have a bad time yes, but in CLTV, you could check for when the P2SH transaction was published to the blockchain, if it was before the due date, a new legacy output could temporarily be made legal.
I think we should test this method with non-segwit addresses in 2-3 years.
It really shouldn't be more trivial than the requirement of using Low-S values.

Old non-upgraded miners won't mine SegWit transactions, unless they manually enable it (mining non-standard transactions. No miner does this today).


Non-BIP149 miners would accept an illegal SegWit transaction (illegal in the eyes of BIP149), this causes a chainsplit the moment that transaction is included in a block mined by the non-BIP149 miner.  
BIP149 miners would never work on top of that chain and would reject the block, causing a chainsplit.


They are, but then they're doing an _active_ choice to mess up. They must mine transactions that they do not fully understand, which obviously is not a good idea.  
In BIP148, miners do not have any choice other than to signal for segwit.
To further clarify, "non-standard" means that miners wouldn't normally include the transaction in a block, but if it is included in a block anyway by another miner, it won't be considered illegal and wouldn't be rejected.
With SegWit, you make the rule set more strict so some transactions that would be considered legal are now made illegal (this is basically a "softfork").  
Old nodes do not understand this and considers all SegWit transactions legal, this is why a chainsplit could potentially happen.
This is how you do a proper soft-fork - you make sure that miners cannot mess up if they do not actively choose to do so.

@_date: 2017-05-05 13:16:39
It all depends on what transactions are included in the block, as witness (signature) data counts as 0.25 bytes for every 1 byte.
So a block normal transactions (P2(W)PKH) would be around 1.7MB, as a normal transactions don't have that much witness (signature) data.
A block with only multisig (P2(W)SH) would be around 2.2MB, as multisig transactions have more signature data
But pure theoretically a block could max be 4MB.
The SegWit BIP141 is a little bit confusing, but read here:

If miners are having a covert softfork sure, they can enforce this rule.  
But this is the complete opposite of my point.
In the case of legacy -&gt; segwit -&gt; legacy, if you do not know the program of the segwit transaction, you cannot fully verify that the chain of transactions is valid. You and the vast majority of the other full nodes need and should run a segwit fullnode.
In the case of _forbidding_ last 8 bytes being digits of Pi, if that transaction is in the chain of transactions, you know that it was valid as it is in a block.

No, it is technically a blocksize increase.
With segwit miners, segwit nodes and segwit transactions, a block full of transactions _will_ be larger than 1MB. This is a blocksize increase, not "effectively" one.

Sorry, this was a bit unclear from my aprt. Distruption (orphaning) can happen once an illegal segwit transaction is mined.


Oh yes, it is opt-in to mine SegWit blocks.  
Softforks in Bitcoin are generally opt-in.
SegWit is opt-in in 2 different ways:
1. Users are free to do SegWit transactions or not
2. Miners are free to mine SegWit blocks or not

UASF was used because there wasn't any other established method of deploying a softfork. BIP9 ("block header version bits") came along with the CSV softfork and is now used for Segwit.
Worth noting is that BIP9 is _still_ a UASF, and all forks are always user activated. BIP9 is just a convenient way to monitor "adoption" and a way to assume that the network is ready when 95% of the miners are signaling.
Unfortunately it is now being exploited as a way to prevent network upgrades and turn protocol development into a political game.

Who are the underserved? Poor people? If that's what you mean, they _definitely_ care about transaction fees.


Like what? Do you mean that 2MB (or  even 20MB!) blocks are jeopardizing the health of the network?


A hardfork would obviously be orchestrated, just like softforks are (albeit the same method(s) aren't possible as all nodes absolutely need to upgrade).


Scaling to thousands of transactions absolutely needs an increase. Have you even read about Lightning Network?


So other people don't have a valid opinion.


How can you claim this?  
EDIT: Also, isn't using "real users" a bit of a No True Scotsman?


This is such a silly argument. Bitcoin Core does not _own_ bitcoin, that's why they call themselves Bitcoin Core and separated from Bitcoin.org. So the argument that you should go to an altcoin if you don't like the polices of Core is just mindbogglingly ignorant.  
So who really owns bitcoin? Everyone, including miners whom have showed support for a blocksize increase hardfork.

@_date: 2017-07-01 12:00:07


You're absolutely not alone thinking that's a good idea. Anyone who understands open source should understand.
Bitcoin is an open source project, you don't go call the Linux project for "Linux Core" or vim for 'Vim Core", so for me it makes no sense to call the Bitcoin project "Bitcoin Core".
Sure people can fork off the project if they want other features/strategies, for example, neovim forked off vim, and it was successful!
Now, Bitcoin is also a decentralized network that requires absolute consensus amongst the nodes, otherwise the system will be set to a malfunctioning state, so we have a fundamental difference here between normal open source projects and Bitcoin. We need differentiate between forks that change the consensus rules and those who don't.
Forks that do change the consensus rules (hardfork) should maybe be considered altcoins.

Good point. If there's a sufficient amount of nodes and miners on a chain, I think it is effectively is a fork. The sufficient numbers are all arbitrary of course, we cannot define this through speech or expression.  
I know orphans happens, but the consensus rules between the nodes are still the same.  
It differs from hard fork because then the longest chain will be invalid according to the node.

First and foremost, like have been said 100000 times already, some individuals from the Bitcoin project attended to the round table.  
There is no official Core "stance".
These individuals agreed to work on a hardfork to increase the blocksize while maintaining 4M weight units.  
This means a blocksize max 4MB 
NYA means max 8MB.

Yup exactly, and I don't think that's going away.  
The advantage is too big, all infrastructure, applications and protocols are built around Bitcoin.


I do agree that other coins can have advantages that makes them ultimately superior to Bitcoin, and the thing is, Bitcoin can to some extent and probably will adapt to new features. _It absolutely needs to do this_. This will be even more easier with SegWit rolling out which enables Script versioning.  
But _hard forks_ is another matter. My personal wish is that Bitcoin should hardfork for new features but it seems very very unlikely this will ever happen because of what we've seen for the last two years trying to do a simple thing as increasing the block size limit.

1. The Ethereum infrastructure is different than Bitcoin, plus its _much_ smaller.
2. The reason why people oppose hardfork in Ethereum is not the same reason people oppose hardfork in Bitcoin. To break it down:
    a. People oppose an Ethereum hardfork because it fundamentally destroys the trust and social contract people have in Ethereum.
    b. People oppose a Bitcoin hardfork (more specifically, a block size increase) because of fear of centralization.  
Some people thinks extensive planning is needed because of the _much bigger ecosystem and  infrastructure_, to mitigate the risk of bitcoin loss.

Actually, yes. This debate subtly comes up everywhere. _We_ the users(edit: nodes) needs to decide what bitcoin is, not follow and obey miners like sheep.

I don't advocate for micropayments in Bitcoin without payments channels, that has never "worked" and was debunked years ago. Journalists liked to talk about that some years ago, but it's is indeed very clear that LN and other ideas will finally, for the first time in history, enable micropayments in a decentralized manner.


Yes and who says you need to wait 10 minutes? Let's pretend that the Lightning network technology didn't exist (which was true 1.5 years ago (yes I'm aware that payments channels have existed since ~2011)), would you declare Bitcoin a failure then, because you have to wait 10 mins for a confirmation?  
I don't think you have to wait.


If you think the adoption will stall, yeah sure, then we don't need an increase, but if you believe we should _plan for success_, then the obvious answer is Yes, we need an increase.  
And also, in reverse, there's nothing that says that Lightning will succeed either.
About disputes and how LN will operate in practice, I don't agree that we should have a such pragmatic approach, if anything, _that_ sounds dangerous. Plan for Success.
@_date: 2016-07-05 20:10:16


I hear this argument a lot, and I just find it plain silly. No one will use a 2MB sidechain if everyone else doesn't follow. Currencies live of their network effect -  a sidechain effectively means another currency that is interchangeable with Bitcoin. Interchangeable means a freeze time when swapping of about 100 blocks when doing in a native decentralized manner (if I remember the whitepaper correctly).
So where does sidechains really shine? We don't know yet. EDIT: I think Rootstock will be the first major sidechain.

Bitcoin's scripting language cannot do so much, a professional company would indeed choose _Ethereum_ over Bitcoin because of that. It is a bit worrisome, as we know and have seen that the design trade-offs that Ethereum made are utterly terrible.  
I am very confident in Bitcoin as a more programmable system though, with SegWit allowing easier deployment of new OP codes and MAST solving scaling issues.
Edit: Down-voters, please reply.
@_date: 2016-07-28 09:58:16
SPV is ultimately trade-off. If SPV's were as good as full-nodes, there would be no incentive to have a full node. Yes, we all know that SPV's aren't as good as Satoshi envisioned, but it's not terrible either.


What I'm trying to say is that there is some kind of balance of trusting "people" and running a SPV, and personally I'm happy to have a SPV wallet on my phone where running a full-node just isn't feasible today. If I hear all over the news inside the bitcoin world and in mainstream media about a possible 51% attack, I'll of course take caution.

No? The constant is still set to 1 megabyte after SegWit is deployed, AFAIK the reason for the _effective_ blocksize increase is that old clients won't register the witnesses and new SegWit clients won't count them to the full transaction size. I'm not 100% sure about the techinical details here.


I run a full node too. No issues at all. My only worry would be _validation_ performance, not blocksize.


Why not both? It seems like you're putting up a false dichotomy, I am very excited about Lightning, but that doesn't mean that I want a clear and significant block size increase. And also, it won't be like flip switch to Lightning, it will probably take years before it's fully established.


Make no mistake, we absolutely need a blocksize increase, even with Lightning Network(s).


We absolutely know when we start seeing full blocks all the time, I would rather plan beforehand than experiencing that. I'm not sure such a pragmatic approach here is the best.


I agree. SegWit is definitely buying us time, which is good. I would rather see a hard fork that changes more than just the block size. Fixing some dirty bugs would be good.  
See my point about difficulty in changing internet protocols as time goes on though.

I disagree, I think there's a massive non-vocal majority that would, in the question of "Increase block size now?" answer "Yes.". If you remember last year, or even in 2014, there were no doubt in that the majority who were discussing in the forums here (not just some people) wanted an increase. Things have changed though as censorship is in place and a lot of people are frustrated (hence alternative forums).


Agreed. I don't think many people disagree with this, but it's not all black and white. People can still want a block size increase.

Indeed if the miner intentionally want to kill off the network, but I don't think it's that easy, a such block would and could probably get orphaned.


In "practice"? Come on, you cannot just say that. We don't know what would happen in practice. And also, miners having _soft_ block size limits already exists (or has existed in the past, defaulted to 750kB and now 1000kB)


No, why would we have hard forks because of that?


No I cannot, and I don't actually think there exist any successful altcoins yet. And no I disagree, you cannot assert that removing the block size limit will make Bitcoin completely unworkable, if anything, it could actually develop a fee-market, as miners would need to be conservative about not doing an all too big block in the risk of being orphaned, and lots of transactions would be filled in the mempool.

Sure I agree, but surely you must see that there are differences here.
In normal bitcoin transactions, miners cannot steal your money, which is the case with your counterparty in a LN channel.


Yes, that's what I said in the previous post...

Okay, thanks for the information. :)
@_date: 2016-07-25 09:49:22
One possible outcome is that, as the mining reward shrinks, it will be less profitable for large mining operations to run, and we go back to a more like "peoples" mining.
People seems to paint up this idea that the whole system will crash and burn - if large mining pools starts to close, _we_, the non-miners can fill up the space.
@_date: 2016-07-18 09:22:52
You didn't really respond to my reply.
Also, _you_ were the one bringing up altcoins.
If there's a product/altcoin/scam that says it is superior to Bitcoin, I think it is absolutely reasonable to discuss it in a bitcoin forum.

@_date: 2016-07-21 12:00:35
Yes lets not discuss the danger of hard forks! /s
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:59:15


I think the term softfork is wrong here. It's all about negotiation between the parties AFAIK. If your counterparty cannot open a channel &gt; 2^24, you simply won't or find another one that will. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 11:25:16


Indeed, I don't know who wouldn't realize that, it's very obvious, at least for me.


Agreed, but until we have MAST and possibly new OP codes/enabling old ones, I think there's more possibilities with Ethereum/Solidity, despite it being an insane approach.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:25:52


You are missing my point, SegWit isn't some kind of magic bullet. Read my comment again.
Litecoin uses the same fundamental blockchain structure as Bitcoin and thus will have the same problem as bitcoin even with SegWit and whatnot. It's a property of the design we have in blockchains at the moment. It does not scale very well.
SegWit, Lightning and whatnot will help the burden, but they do not change the fundamentals.


That is just nonsense.


I honestly couldn't care less about Charles and his Yours project. He follows all the conspiracy theories and abandoned ship as soon as Bitcoin  started to face its first real problem.
 
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:09:34


Yes the softfork part of SegWit2x, which will activate SegWit (on version bit 1, BIP141) is done and set. It includes BIP91 which   
It is also made compatible with BIP148 "UASF".
The hardfork part is still being worked out AFAICT.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:37:48
Take caution, any miner could still short the market by _not_ running a segwit2x-node when the time comes.
What miners are doing now is signaling _commitment_ to signal for segwit2x.

Makes sense, waiting for a more appropriate time.
My fear though is that as time goes on, it will be more and more difficult to coordinate and execute a hard fork as the network grows, just look at other internet protocols or even IP itself.
The block size hard fork will probably be our one and only hard fork ever.
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:19:01
I have to actually disagree...
It was brutal when Bitstamp got hacked in the beginning of 2015 (sub $200).
@_date: 2016-07-23 15:14:06
No... That's one way to see it.  
Hard forks ultimately means that different nodes could not reach a consensus, thus forking the chain to two or more chains.
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:19:42
Correctly me if I'm wrong but it won't interact natively with bitcoin-the-currency, just like Rootstock won't?

I guess we'll have to wait and see. One potential problem with current mining operations is the stagnation in ASICs, they are already at 16nm, AFAIK advancements are unclear.

Yes and that is good, AFAIK they even have some kind of low-level interoperability, but you're still missing my point, who the hell cares about 3-4 LN reference nodes if there are no real Android or iPhone wallets actually utilizing LN?  Schildbach's Wallet needs LN, Mycelium needs LN, breadwallet needs LN.




Indeed I hope so as well. SegWit will already provide a lot of headroom for us, so that's good.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:19:05

No that's Bitfury George.
@_date: 2017-07-09 15:21:42
Sigh... Go look up the code yourself if you don't believe me.
SegWit replaces the blocksize with block weight, and a max block weight is set to 4M (output data counts towards 4bytes instead of 1).
SegWit2x changes the max block eight to 8M (meaning maximum 8MB blocks)

Don't forget Schnorr 1 sig aggregation!
Basically with Schnorr signatures, it's possible to have multiple inputs signed by 1 signature. So instead of `100 bytes * no.  inputs`, it's just `100 bytes` (or whatever it will be).
This would _greatly_ help consolidate many inputs and is something Roger Ver himself personally have whined about.

@_date: 2017-07-05 10:56:04


Oh no, they absolutely think SW and PW pose threat to Bitcoin.


They have a different idelogy than people at r/bitcoin have.
They do not care if fullnodes cannot be run by normal PC users, they only care about what they think is "adoption". SPV is fine for them.
Many people in r/bitcoin believe that the decentralization of Bitcoin is it's main point, thus it's reckless to increase the blocksize too much, especially when we have updates in the pipeline that make the blockchain and transaction more efficient without increasing the blocksize (Schnorr signatures, MAST etc).
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:43:26
Jeez they're completely out of touch with reality if they think anyone in Core would withhold an important feature until the day before the hardfork.  
This is the thing that Core members has numerous times blamed other people for doing.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:20:11
Gavin and a lot of rbtc nutjobs think that full nodes are redundant/unecessary and miners are the only real full nodes.   
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:39:58


My pessimistic view is these are pure scams and shitcoins.  YES, of course they have technical appeal, but all the other bullshit is just too much (like zcash taking 20% cut from miners). You don't create a cryptocurrency by creating a company.


The only interesting project that can actually scale and maintain good privacy seems to be MimbleWimble, it fixes both scaling and privacy.
In general, I agree though, the only cryptos in the space that should have any appeal are privacy enhancing cryptos.

@_date: 2016-07-24 23:35:18
I'll just say this; if bitcoin were to become used for real applications by lots of people, it must be much higher  than what it is worth today, and the reason being the coin cap of 21 million coins.
@_date: 2016-07-22 13:42:48
Why? I think Ethereum itself is a significant innovation, although I don't agree on the design choices of Ethereum - MAST and all other cool stuff coming to Bitcoin are much better.
Please don't discredit innovative alt-coins such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Zerocash or even Peercoin (first one to try out PoS).
But yeah, as a Bitcoin maximalist I'm staying with Bitcoin, but I still think it's wrong to discredit alt-coins.
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:41:32
Well for starters you need to monitor the blockchain, or delegate to someone who will. Because if you don't, your counterparty can broadcast an old channel state, and doublespend.

Uhm yeah it absolutely cheaper to use a normal RDBMS. The competence is much higher across the industry, and with RDBMS or any other well established database, you don't need to build it from scratch, saving enormous amount of money.


What does this even mean? Who in the earth has a such set up?


I'm sorry, but I don't think you understand what a blockchain is then.  
A blockchain (or rather _the_ Blockchain) works, _today_, only because of Proof of Work, that is the only confirmed method of using a blockchain securely and without trust.  
You may say that I have a narrow vision, but this is what we have today, there's no other battle tested method (except maybe Proof of Stake).
If you want to have a consensus across entities with a shared database, I suggest you choose another word other than  "Blockchain". Using the word blockchain, today, in any other context than within Bitcoin and other altcoins is extremely dishonest because it confuses the narrow idea of what a blockchain is, defined by Satoshi.


Public and private blockchains? They are so distinct from each other that it doesn't even make any sense saying that.


I do welcome research, and the Raft consensus algorithm seems pretty cool, but I do not agree that it can or should be used with a blockchain.

I don't believe we _can_ change TCP/IP no. Look how far IPv6 has gotten.


HTTP 2.0 was developed by Google and other big companies to serve their needs, even if it's truly better it's still far from an organic development. And it's yet to see if will gain any traction. Perhaps it will, perhaps it won't.
And HTTP 2.0, as far as I can tell, is still HTTP, so I don't really understand your point.


Which failed horribly I might add. And it's still HTML and was "backwards compatible" with HTML 4 (exception XHTML 2.0, which never gained any traction).


And it's also naive to pump shitcoins just because they're slightly better. Why not use all energy in the existing ecosystem instead?

@_date: 2017-06-12 10:34:14
Lightning Network is an application on top of Bitcoin, that transactions cheaper and more efficient.
Its features are:
* 0 fees (or a _very_ small fee)  
* Micropayments (sub $1 payments)  
* Instant are instant. Normal bitcoin transactions need to wait for confirmations, lightning transactions do not.
What makes lighting interesting is that it will still be decentralized and trustless, just as Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2016-07-27 11:22:10

@_date: 2017-06-20 13:26:54
Sure, better to be on the safe side.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:26:54
Fair enough. That's a trade-off I personally wouldn't take.
I'm in the position that bitcoin will indeed scale up and we'll reach consensus, it's just that it's sooo much more difficult because our ecosystem is massive compared to the alts.
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:11:02


We have a fundamental disagreement here. Lightning network is not live in any capacity right now, on any blockchain, and literally 0 people are using it. What are you really trying to accomplish here by claiming that?


No not only that, it has to be _developed_, there are literally 0 Lighting wallets for users available at the moment. We barely have a standardized lighting address (thanks Rusty for your amazing work so far).  
It will take years before lighting takes off in big scale (if ever, that is).


That is an segwit output, not necessarily a lighting channel, in fact, we do not know if it's a lighting channel because it's a P2SH (meaning the script code is not known before the output is spent).
I am pretty darn sure that /u/ throwaway40338210716 just made a normal segwit output and not a payment channel.
Also Lighting has really no new security assumptions that is not already in Bitcoin. It's all really proven cryptography (relatively).
Also, you don't have to prove for me how great segwit and lighting is. I love SegWit and I definitely love LN. I don't understand your point.


Sure, I like that.

But can be completely addressed by implementing "Schnorr signature aggregation" (x inputs become one (1)), which needs SegWit first.

Well in the context of bitcoin, it is being used for sub $1 payments, which is only enabled by payment channels/lightning network(s) really.


AFAIK these are using custodial wallets and thus are completely off-chain. Of course you can do microtransactions on a centralized service.


No, this isn't an optimization. Blocks are _not_ made more efficient. We're merely tricking old nodes by not sending them signature data, meaning that we maximize the old 1MB block with output data, preventing a blocksize increase hardfork.  
The signature data, "witness", is counted towards the segwit nodes blocksize, which is max 4MB.
This isn't an efficiency. Again, neither blocks nor transactions are made more efficient.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:44:54


Like what?
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:42:18
I love the lightning network too. Here are some of my concerns:
1. Your counterparty (or one of your counterparties) and the one you're sending to must be online at the time of the transaction.
2. You or someone else needs to always monitor the blockchain and look for contract breaches, otherwise you can end up losing money if your counterparty tries to cheat
3. Bootstrapping process can be painful, because you may not be able to send to a normal bitcoin address
4. Complex contract transactions such as in those possible to do in normal bitcoin on-chain transactions are not possible to do in LN today (not even theoretically AFAICT). LN is solely for normal person-to-person payments.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:30:29


I agree that the timeline for Segwit2x is completely reckless.


Well actually, we might will see a coercive hardfork, because after the BIP91 part of segwit2x is deployed (which requires all blocks to signal for Segwit), all miners will need to run Segwit2x, or risk being orphaned, so we'll likely see a 100% miner support for segwit2x (they could run a UASF BIP148 node as well, but I think that's pretty unlikely).
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:51:15
Oh... Yes you might be right.
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:13:57
Don't worry, Ethereum will have sharding sharding in a month or two. /s
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:12:38
Orphans are a fundamental part of Bitcoin, it will always exist. FIBRE and other improvements aim to reduce the orphan risk.


It's not, just look at the IPv4 failure. We need to think big, plan for success.
Internet protocols just don't change. I'm afraid of the future, I'm afraid that this conservative view will effectively kill bitcoin, because the bigger the network is, the harder a hardfork will be to organize.
SegWit is giving us a lot of breathing room, which is good. But then after that we must have a final solution, because I believe that we will only ever have one intentional hardfork in Bitcoin's history.
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:51:20


So something that... maybe 65% of all wallets use, is broken?!

They fixed it in time with SegWit, plus a dedication to work towards A HARDFORK BLOCKSIZE INCREASE after SegWit is deployed.

That's not what I said.  
SegWit will help _anyway_ because of the witness data discount.

No, comparing OneCoin to legit cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Ethereum is extremely dishonest and is not doing anyone a favor.
OneCoin is a _scam_. There's no exchange, there's no source code, there's no open blockchain and AFAIK there actually is no coin.
EDIT: And also, the only _improvement_ I've heard that OneCoin provides is baked in KYC. Yeah...
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:03:32
I'm not sure what you're saying, if they are making sure to activate segwit2x before july 31st it is "de facto" compatible with UASF BIP148.

Yes I would imagine so.


Yes I know, I think we'll probably see atomic cross-swap between different lightning networks on different cryptos in the far future.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:59:25
One acceptable reason would be to increase the blocksize.
But it should be bundled with bugfixes etc... preferably Johnson Lau's spoonnet/forcenet.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:33:46


Like what?






Oh right, more AnyoneCanSpend-FUD! How great.  
Okay so to be able to steal from a segwit transaction, you would need to reverse the blocks of the 2 weeks of grace period, losing how many millions of dollars?


That is why _every_ node in the network needs to be compatible in the long run, fortunately more than 80% of the nodes are ready to enforce the new rules, including the vast majority of the ecosystem.  
Despite of what people think, _all nodes_ need to update in a softfork (but in comparison to hardforks, they won't be forked off the network if they don't).


As soon as they try to steal funds (without reverting back the deployment), _they are hardforking_.


This is a hardfork, it could be just as likely be done to a legacy address/output.


2. A group of mining pools and companies with a joint hash rate in excess of 50% of the current network power form a cartel.
3. The cartel group then stops signaling SegWit and returns to the network to the former bitcoin protocol.
4. If a sufficient quantity of bitcoin is transacted using SegWit, the cartel would switch from SegWit to treat all transactions using the original protocol. Cartel members could then instantly use the “AnyOneCanSpend” address from SegWit to steal funds from the transactions in blocks they mined (especially any high-value block). To incentivize miners to join the cartel, the cartel could agree that each member distributes stolen funds from their attacked blocks to the whole the group in some proportion (for example, according to the hash rate each maintains.) No one miner or mining pool would need to itself have 51% of the hash rate in order to participate.
Again, _this is hardforking the network_ no sane node would follow these rules.
Also, what does "signal segwit" mean here? After SegWit _has been deployed_ (meaning 95% support, not 50%), miner will not "signal segwit" anymore, they would mine segwit blocks.


Cool, name one more (preferably a reasonable one).


I disagree. As soon as the new rules have been deployed, this is the new bitcoin (I assume node support here). The economics of the system wouldn't be changed, maybe under your perverse understanding of bitcoin, sure, I wouldn't know. 
I gave up reading after this.
Conclusion: yeah there's no way in hell that this is Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2016-07-20 09:33:27
Thanks for your reply Greg.  
I'm not getting it though, as far as my knowledge goes, an encrypted Bitcoin core wallet backup is secure because it's computationally expensive to try out different passwords, which means it can even be shared on the internet - or is this guy that has a web page where he shares his wallet.dat at risk?  
Sure, 2-factor is valid point, in that backups aren't all on the internet, but are you saying that they would be insecure if they _were_ on the internet (even with a somewhat good password)?
Also, how can a HD mnemonic seed with 12 words with its 1024 bit entropy (IIRC) be secure? Wouldn't the same thing apply here as with Brain wallets?
@_date: 2016-07-30 22:38:02

I didn't say that LN is not an efficient technology, it probably is.  
Your comment implied that Litecoin has lighting, which is nonsense. I could fork lnd and do a Lightning transaction on any crappy shitcoin, but what practical value does it really have?  
Make no mistake, Lighting is far from production ready.
Also your link is about SegWit, not Lighting.
Perhaps you should comment on the other stuff I wrote instead of just one tangent.   
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:33:00
Tell me the real _practical_ difference.
Almost every bitcoin wallet/service are ready to flip the switch to make SegWit transactions once SegWit is deployed, making sure that the blocksize will be larger than 1MB (yes the actual block being broadcasted across the network).
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:11:52
75% is fine for a softfork, the reason why it was increased to 95% was because some dumb miners SPV-mined, but that's their decision/fault, not fullnodes.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:47:07
That should then apply to the sidechain 51% too.

You still do not get my point. I don't care about test transactions, I only care about an actual Lighting Network network.


A transaction malleability fix is, yes.


I would say it's a rearrangement, but sure, it's changes how transactions are serialized.


Again, I don't necessarily disagree that Lighting will be efficient, it's probably our best hope we have at the moment ("boost litecoin transactions by as much as a million times" is an extraordinary claim though).

@_date: 2017-06-17 10:41:05


Well I see a scenario where normal people wouldn't be able to know, because the cost of running a blockchain is too high. I guess block explorers etc can _claim_ a double-spending had occurred, but how would you know?
I assume the worst in these scenarios, which is why I take a somewhat conservative position towards blocksize increases nowadays.
@_date: 2016-07-25 13:08:29
Okay so a transaction is _broadcasted_ across the network in about a second. I think it reaches something like 90% of all nodes within 10 seconds.
The transaction is _confirmed_ when it appears in a block, a new block is created around every 10 minutes - that won't change if every node is connected with the maximum available bandwidth, this is a fundamental rule about Bitcoin. It is not supposed to change.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:34:57
But no one is actually transacting on it. No one is using it in real life - you don't see articles from FEE about families in desperate need of Ethereum (simply because bitcoin is good enough).
That Ethereum is gaining market cap is because of pumps. People see companies and banks going full Ethereum and thinks it has a real world appeal. (I'm not saying it cannot have a real world appeal, but as it stands right now in 2nd June 2017, there simply isn't any usage for Ethereum).
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:07:15
Litecoin is built on the exact same kind of blockchain structure that Bitcoin has.  Given time, it _will_ have the exact same problems, claiming anything otherwise is disingenuous.
