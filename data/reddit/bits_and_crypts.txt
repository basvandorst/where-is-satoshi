The definition implied by the comic strip. "We give banks the privilege to create money and then we borrow it from them". I think that's a bit misleading, we don't give them the privilege to create money, but rather the ability to create credit (in the form of us borrowing from them).

The big caveat is that $1,000,000+ "satoshis an everyday currency" is only possible if we solve scaling. Lightning needs to work and it needs to be implemented as soon as we can. Without it the fees will only get worse.

Thanks MindNugget! I have found the videos very helpful. I'm attempting to set up a test node for lightning today but I am starting from an area of limited understanding. I have a small team of developers that I'll be introducing to lightning today and hopefully they can help me figure it all out. If you have any tips or any other resources that would be greatly appreciated!

Yeah you're right and it's going to cause heaps of confusion. In finance the cash market for a product (whether it be equities, fixed income or currencies) is the market where the underlying asset you are exchanging is the product itself. An alternative would be if the underlying is a derivative (i.e. a futures contract).

I think the banks are more worried about KYC and AML regulation. Especially CBA after the recent ATM scandal. If it was cash management then surely one customers outflows of AUD would be mitigated by the other customers inflow (i.e. the exchange receiving AUD also has to bank with someone).

Kiwi here. The Bitcoin industry in NZ is very very small and nothing like the title suggests. We have a very advanced retail banking sector which means we basically already live in a cashless society. Eftpos cards (debit cards) are accepted everywhere and most places now also accept visa paywave (tap n go), with mobile payments via NFC coming soon (Westpac recently trialed the technology).

The USD price of Bcash and ETH has tracked very closely over the last week (range bound to $300). It almost feels like some of the speculative money really has no idea of the value to place on these. Market caps need to be considered. I still see people pumping ethereum because "it's only $300 and one day could be worth $4000 like bitcoin!" - what they don't say is that at $300 it's actually worth half as much as bitcoin (in terms of market cap).
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:52:48
I've shared this picture on this sub but it's being downvoted. The real flow driving the BCH price is BCH/KRW - money coming out of Korea..

right now the highest volume pair involving USDT is ranked 9th... 2.5% of total volume. The largest pairs are korean won and btc
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:35:20
Sorry for using the BCH screenshot instead of the BTC one, I just thought it was more interesting since it's 32% and on bithumb BCH has double the trading volume as BTC. Anyone know what could be causing this flow? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:53:10
Agreed. I think BCH looks attractive for the simple reason that people think its cheap. The classic "one day it could be 4000 like btc!" argument. Flawed logic and definitely overvalued right now ($600 on poloniex 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:51:26

@_date: 2019-08-09 14:56:58
I don't know the answer haha. I thought you might. 
I guess we have to look at who the buyers of these futures are. Why do they pay a premium for forward delivery of BTC when BTC has such low/zero storage costs. Perhaps because they're able to get better leverage on the future than on spot. Maybe the premium is therefore caused by a lack of supply of the future instead of too much demand. But supply of the future should be plentiful when the spot-future arb exists (e.g.right now you can sell the sep 27 future for 12000 and buying the spot for 11760, locking in a 2% return in less than 2 months).

Serious question: if something is on sale on Amazon for $29 including shipping (down from $35), would you buy it with visa where it costs $29 or bitcoin where it's $29 plus fee? I would never voluntarily pay more for stuff on Amazon when the whole reason I use them is to save a few bucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:33:13
Interesting reaction from markets. The USDt price of bitcoin just dropped ~5% from 8300 to 7900, which implies it's now cheaper to buy bitcoin using USD tether than it was before the news. This might just be tracking the USD price of bitcoin on other exchanges, but I would suspect the flows to be the other way around. I.e. sell USDt to buy BTC

independent reserve is reasonably good however the liquidity is poor. Fees are very low (free bank transfers from Aus banks + 0.5% trading fee if i remember right). 
There's another called acx.io that looks liquid but I've never used it. edit: Don't use acx.io, looks like they charge 1% just to withdraw your funds. That's insane. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:04:34
All these people asking about fees but the real hidden fee is whether they shafted you on the exchange rate. Did you happen to check the market price at the time of transaction to see whether 0.0008 btc really was $4.38?

It's crypto to crypto only. Positive of this is that the KYC requirements are very low so you can get trading straight away. Negative is that they don't accept fiat, so you'll first need to use another exchange to buy crypto (like USDt is a popular one). The platform itself is very fast and responsive and has lots of liquidity. Price makers are charged less (0.25%) vs price takers (0.50%)

Full quote below from Satoshi on Dec 10 2010. It was in reference to "BitDNS" and is about the 9th post down in the link provided.
"The networks need to have separate fates.  BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices"

All bitcoins are unspent transaction outputs (UTXO's)  
A bitcoin transaction at a minimum has 2 outputs and 1 input. One output is the Bitcoin that was sent and the other output is the changed received.
 Bitcoin is unspent outputs from some previous transaction. It will remain an unspent output until it's used as an input for a transaction.

The majority of Marks criticism comes from what he's seeing right now in the world of ethereum and ICOs, which absolutely is in a state of euphoria and quite likely a bubble. Once that bursts we'll see Bitcoin get dragged down in the dirt with it. However much like the Mt Gox bubble it will not kill Bitcoin. A few years later it will still be chugging along and the digital economy that exists on Bitcoins blockchain will continue to grow; resulting in a ledger that is worth far more than it is today.
