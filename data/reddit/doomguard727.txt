good on ya mate, you deserve attention for working hard (:
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:03:30
mm probably best to explain to the bank what happened
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:58:36
um, i think the biggest PnD is probably cage coin, it rose more than 10000% in just a day (?). But as for Ucash, yes it's most likely a PnD. To determine a PnD, consider the factors of whether A: there's positive news, B:Is it rising TOO fast. Always remember when a coin rises too fast like Ucash is doing, it will always correct, it's hard to know when it will correct, but it will correct very soon most likely.
Edit : lots of complaints, huge dev premine (it seems)...these are the perfect recipe for a pump and dump. If you got in early, you will make a good profit from this PnD, but be careful if you choose to hold, since when it corrects, you will most likely be left holding the bags

but...what if the whale is..."too" big, how can you hang something like that? lol
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:21:06
ouch, did the bike break?
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:56:49
so uh, can we get a screenie of their hash rate?
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:33:31
well, not today so far, its back at 8700 right now lol
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:23:00
too bored of FUD to care really :/
honestly, bitcoin will either be $0 or $inf value in money, let's just enjoy the ride and live our lives

70+ pages.....:(
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:23:49
oh my, it was kind of expected though tbf
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:49:06
it came close to 10k last night, but seemed to have fell down alot, it seems people are profit taking at 9.9
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:01:18
will their computers overheat or do they have good cooling?
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:56:39
it's trending pretty high today, maybe he will get to say his "IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!" meme? lol
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:11:34
there's a 300 ucash fee just to send it, so that would only be 7 ucash left :/
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:32:58
yep...ik that feel, i've given up on my litecoin being worth anything at this point, i've kept a single litecoin since last year and converted all my other litecoins into eth when eth was $600, still got bitcoin and bch though :^)
also lol @ bch being worth $0
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:54:07
no idea what that means haha
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:55:11
NOOOOOOOooooooooooooooo...ooooooo...oooo....ooo...bitcoin shall never die! *guards the 8k price floor with my life* (it seriously does seem to be trying to rebound though, I think after the FUD clears, it will go up enough so that it might hit 10k again, or at least let people exit without losing at just 8k)
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:07:53
hm is this real?
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:58:33
tbf when it crashed from 1200, it was easier to sell at 1200 and buy back in with a 600% gain (6x the coins), so when it did go on a moon mission last year, could be 6 times as rich lol
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:41:46
short bitcoin at 19k ftw? :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:34:10
its 5 am and it just hit 9500, whew go bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:39:13
lol idc if USDT is a scam or if it was made of magical ponies, it saved me thousands so idm using it :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:35:47
it's stable at 8k, it's gonna drop lower probably unfortunately. It would be really nice to see it go higher, but I think yesterday was just a deadcat bounce
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:28:19
dat feel of riding the coaster instead of anchoring my bitcoin to tether, oh why oh why didn't I bother to tether my bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:05:05
7k now haha
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:04:26
well, when it goes down, it always seems to bounce back (at least temporarily), the fall was really rapid, so it's bound to come up a little since people see opportunity and want in on it while it's there (it's come up back to around 9k since I first typed the other msg), but other then that, can't really think of any other reasons, but hope it at least gets close to 10k so I can get a little bit more USDT lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:47:29
nah, it's going back up actually, not that much, but it's alot less alarming then when it was at 8500 today lol
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:44:23
uh...this is literally what they said about btc never going under 10k haha...if history teaches us anything, each reduction will be down 50-60%, which means that it will probably fall to 4k-5k in this trend
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:48:26
i got scared when I saw myself losing 10s of thousands, but the fear subsides once you realize that the price dips pretty much every year :)
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:34:58
when I was 9, all i wanted was a computer...seriously :)
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:42:21
ouch, we have to wait 4 years?! such a long time!
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:57:48
it might be a good idea to wait, its possible that it might correct a bit more to 7k or so
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:59:38
can just convert the amount you want to buy to LTC  or eth, move to coinbase and purchase directly? or use a service like bitpay now that the fees are lower?
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:51:25
yup, bomber robbed everyone out of their life savings, apparently they've been insolvent since last year
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:43:05
what if they panic sold at 20k and fomo brought at 6k? lol
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:06:57
happy chinese new year!
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:58:02
it's been denied 3 times at 99xx....i'm still hoping it will hit 10k but it doesnt really feel like it so far
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:38:39
$9130 in usdt on cryptopia gogo bitcoin, get dat 10k back
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:33:56
it's at 7900 again, go bitcoin! whoo! 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:15:08
it hit 8k...and it's gone already...:(
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:23:50
9800 now but looks good
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:48:23
hmm out of curiosity, um how do you make iced tea with bitcoins? lol is there a reason the company wanted to mine aside from profits?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:23:11
9980, 20 more!
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:54:07
i think anyone who invested at 20k is scared at this point to even think about rocket ships lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:49:53
i'm down 91k now...;(
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:36:28
hmm, do you think it will dip back to 8k?
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:55:11
hasnt lightning been around for a while?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:10:19
that electric bill though...
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:58:02
congrats! it's either gonna make you very poor or very rich :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:44:47
you ain't kidding, i'm down almost $82,000 between all crypto...:(
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:31:58
it's trying to rebound, but it's probably not gonna hit it's peak anytime soon, or rather it's former ATH haha
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:45:48
i miss my $89,000...sure that was just gains, but I could have brought a house or burned it in a fire to keep my house warm instead of watching it turn into digital air :( I think the real question is why not keep as many gains as you can while you can since you never know what tommorow brings?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:01:14
"as-is" lol no takesies backsies apparently
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:21:11
i can help with part 2, use coinbase! you dont have to verify anything at all, i did that with thousands in crypto straight to my bank acct
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:13:55
lost $96,822+w/e it costs to move to my wallets, feels pretty bad tbh, thought it was gonna go up while i slept, woke up and its even lower...bleh
going to just put the rest of my crypto except non-essentials in USDT while it freefalls :c
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:26:02
buy through ebay to make the transaction look "legitimate"? thats what i did and never had any issues :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:08:29
lord of the rings mentioned +1 like.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:50:13
7k* haha
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:34:35
are there still BTC in the wallets for us common folk?
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:24:12
yep, it's doing the same thing that it did the last time the "crash" occurred about a week ago though, I think the downtrend is gonna continue unfortunately for a while, the parabolic growth has been generally unsustainable
