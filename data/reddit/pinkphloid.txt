It has lightning and the regular and HD one.  I use the HD wallet.  Never use lightning.

All the time!  I’m on a plane twice a week.  And hotels probably 2-3 times a week.   Used Lolli at Bloomingdales and Barney’s too!

Different shops have different pay back.  Airline is the lowest.  But I book all my hotels through Marriott website using Lolli and i get 4.5 to 6.0 % back.

That’s why our monero wallet on iOS is called Cake Wallet.  ��

Just use Monero

I’ll vouch for that!

At 30, it lost 28 to get to 2 right? 28 is 93.33% of $30.  If i have $100 and now i have $10.  How much have i lost?  $90! Which is 90pct of $100.
You’re looking at it other way around.  If i have $10 and now i have $100, it went up $90 which went up BY 900% or Really you have 1000% of what you started with.
