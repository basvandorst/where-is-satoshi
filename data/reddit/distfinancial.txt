Thanks I've tipped a lot but this is the first tip I've received on reddit :)

I'm almost 30 years old and have some bitcoin to my name as well :) I was just thinking how some generations are lucky enough to get in early on new technologies and new forms of money and others simply aren't. 
Early 20's is the best time for those that are interested in money/blockchain tech. Some generations like our parents and grandparents got to live through some exciting innovations, but had to live under a system created after world war II and central banks their entire lives. 
For those in our generation that are interested in bitcoin, we are lucky enough to have our whole lives to ride this wave that will transform everything and anyone is free to contribute new applications that will make our lives better! Really excited to watch all this unfold and make our own contributions!!

Ross is like a brother to many of us. Most are not in his shoes only because we are not smart enough to have come up with a website this sophisticated. 
This ruling must not be allowed to be carried out. People should not be allowed to rot in prison for a crime with no victims. Between this, Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange/WikiLeaks, I've reached my personal tipping point where we must end the federal government now, it's federal agencies and federal prisons. States are capable of governing themselves. 
I will never wave an American flag. I will never stand during a national anthem. Disgraceful

What about coinsetter in NYC?

Yes, I thought about miners... Is there a place/website to find where miners are located?

I would personally rather hold bitcoin for a vast majority of reasons including ease of use, transparency and limited supply. This particular person wants to convert it to bitcoin so he can easy transfer it to other places around the world where he can deposit into financial institutions.

Great! I had not heard of them before. Seems easy enough.

Yes, I've been reading about fed govt cracking down on overseas accounts. This guy seems to keep investing his money in his business though around the world and don't think he intends to just let it sit in a bank acct. Thanks for looking out

Yeah, now I'm waiting for Airbnb and Uber to flip the switch for hosts and drivers to be able to be paid in bitcoin. 1000 bits
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:56:53
BTCOIN. Got that on my motorcycle in Florida
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:57:39
Yes, that's what I'm going to advise this particular person to do and to put a bitcoin ATM in his shop.

On the upside of Theymos war against over 90% of the bitcoin community, XT will be the only bitcoin much sooner rather than later and we can all put this behind us. We need some of the bitcoin leaders though to find a new community for us to openly discuss without fear of censorship and banning.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:17:57
90% is the actual percentage of votes on posts that wanted to see r/bitcoin mods replaced. We all are moving to r/bitcoinxt until theymos steps down if not indefinitely

Most Western govts have a debt to GDP ratio of over 100% that will never be paid down because individuals are in over there heads in debt as well. 
Money doesn't need to be backed by debt as it currently is and would like to see regional govts begin implementing their own currencies.
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:36:19
Bitcoin is not backed by debt. Money can be backed by debt but it doesn't have to. We need competing monetary policies.

Aahh!! Who are these girls? I had to get "B1TCOIN" for my car and "BTCOIN" for my motorcycle.

I recently learned of deathswitch.com not to long ago. Haven't tried it out myself yet.

Is this you Chris and Josh in NY? -Adrian

It wouldn't magically disappear but trade wouldn't be entirely frozen if debt needs to be renegotiated. We need new monetary policy instead of the same one with different currencies around the world. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:43:45
LOL Its funny because you don't need to destroy fiat currency, you just magically create more since nobody know how many are in circulation anyway

If you hit 14 you'll already be one in a million
