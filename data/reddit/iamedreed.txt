tax evasion 101- if you give your friend money and he gives you more back you owe capital gains on it.  will you get caught? prob not, especially for small amounts but know the risk you are taking.

how does buying an alt with BTC or ETH change the current value of your investment?  Regardless of what you used to purchase the alt coin, your cost basis would be the same if you bought it today in FIAT (which is now your cost basis) and then transferred immediately to make the conversion into alts. The value is still based on the conversion rate to BTC or ETH and then the BTC  or ETH conversion to USD.  And if you are only looking at value based on the conversion rate back to BTC or ETH you would most likely look worse today as ETH has gone up while BTC and most other alts have gone down.

no they aren't because you start with the same amount of capital and you end with the same amount regardless of how many trades you made to get there (gains or losses) you only owe the taxes on what the net of your original investment is

I think QR codes are very simple- at the register once you tell the cashier you're paying in BTC, they will bring up the total in BTC and Fiat with the conversion rate they are using (they did this when I was at Starbucks in Mexico recently for Pesos and USD), fire up the camera and scan the QR code which would embed the correct amount and address, from whatever app your using as your hot wallet (which would show your own Fiat calculation based on whatever exchange rate you choose to ensure the math is correct) hit pay and authenticate with your password, thumbprint, or face. Just as quick as paying with a credit card.
Apple or Google could also easily implement this within their respective pay apps as well and utilize NFC for BTC payments in a similar way.
In addition, coinbase could start their own credit/debit card that allows its users to spend BTC anywhere credit and debit cards are accepted and then automatically do the conversion on the backend for the user.  They basically already do this on the merchant side now, I don't think it would be that difficult to do the reverse.  These transactions could happen off the blockchain so no fees would be necessary and it could be processed immediately.

I've traded with this strategy over the last couple of weeks and it's been pretty successful.  Not a big player though lol
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:10:42
what would be the reason for not batching?  does it slow down the transactions at all? does it cost more money in fees?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:39:15
I still don't see how buying ETH instead of BTC changes any of that. You would still end up with the same amount of alt coin (in US dollars) regardless of what crypto you use to make the exchange (assuming efficient markets) and then once you have made the switch into the alt coin the price of BTC and ETH is now irrelevant 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:15:22
you're gonna pay taxes on the profit you make in crypto too though

how so?  assuming they are all in the same year it doesn't matter how many times he made a trade
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:29:57
this happens a lot in foreign countries where retailers charge a higher rate to convert foreign currency.  The rate is almost always posted somewhere by the register.  I also am able to see what the USD amount I am transferring is from my BTC hot wallet on my phone which is based on the exchange rate I choose.

I thought the largest exchange in the world was Biance, at least when you look at their trading volume via coinmarketcap.  Do you have a source on Bitflyer being larger?
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:03:26
In the OP example the individual trades don't matter since they were all in the same calendar year.  He owes short term capital gains taxes on the difference between his original investment and what he cashed out with at the end of the year (assuming you sold everything).  this will be the equivalent to the taxes owed if you calculated all of the trades individually and much easier to compute.

at what rate? and did you tell them what you were using it for? you obviously have to have other assets worth at least 100K (home equity, retirement accounts, etc.) right?  80K salary is above average for sure, but certainly not enough for a six figure line of credit- at least thats what I thought. Either way props to you man

I'm not sure you do on this and I think about it like this example- if i found a Picasso painting at a garage sale when i was younger and then 50 years later decided i wanted to trade it to my friend for his jackson pollock painting who art dealers have appraised to be worth the exact same value as my Picasso and we do an even trade with nothing else exchanged.  Do i owe taxes on the value of that jackson pollock even though i've gained a net zero in total art value?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:04:49
you owe it on every little trade, and these would most likely be short term as they were not held for over a year.  on the flip side if you lost money you on any trade you can deduct that against your gains
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:17:11
at least they have to have minimum standards and pass audits to qualify for the FDIC insurance which AFIK bitfinex does not. Given the choice between an exchange with FDIC insurance and one without; I think most US customers would prefer the insured exchange.

there is no such thing as 1000 fees, stop your bcash shilling 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:05:36
do you have a link to that?  I interpret the language on their website to mean USD are insured by FDIC and bitcoin by private insurance 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:01:05
What does it mean to back a currency by a military?  The government isn't giving you anything you need to live for those dollars.  They only have worth because people choose to assign them arbitrary value in trade for goods and services.  The US govt can also (and does) decide to print or create money out of thin air that all of a sudden devalues those dollars and reducing purchasing power.  I'm more confident in math then I am in politicians

there are many other costs associated with owning your own home even if you don't have a mortgage.  Property taxes, home owners insurance, HOA fees, maintenance, etc. all cost money.  you shouldn't be buying a house without 20% down to avoid PMI and if you have that kind of liquid cash you are losing out on the opportunity cost to invest and buy bitcoin with that.  In addition, the transaction costs of buying/selling a home are huge, realtor fees, closing costs, eat into a lot of profit, especially if you aren't going to live in the same place for a long time.  Plus the interest you pay in the beginning of a loan is very high. This is also highly dependent on where you live- some places have high rents compared to the home values where it makes purchasing worth while.

@_date: 2017-12-04 06:18:37
why is this such a bad idea?  yes I know about Mt Gox, but coinbase/gdax are based in the US have FDIC and private insurance for all customer funds.  Outside of how you feel they are for the bitcoin community I would think thats the safest place on earth to keep your money.  In addition, in a scenario like this where you want to set stop losses to lock in profit you have no choice but to keep it on an exchange ready to sell
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:51:28
it works well now in the bull market we have been having where basically anyone can generate double digit returns, but it hasn't always been this easy and it won't be like this forever.  Although I expect the long term annual average return of index funds in US equities to exceed your interest rate on your student loans, IMO it won't be enough to justify the increased risk. I'd say you're best case scenario is an annual return of 10% (over a 10 year period) which doesn't account for taxes which will prob drop that down closer to 8%.  I'm not sure the 1.55% premium is worth the risk especially when you consider the relatively short time horizon (compared to retirement accounts) of paying off student loans.  If you would have tried doing this 15 years ago you would have been screwed, but you're fortunate to have picked a good time to be doing this.  Paying off debt is guaranteed return, I think most people here would take a risk free return of 6.45%.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:56:32
if someone comes to my house and steaks 100K in cash from me is the government coming to pay me back?  That's what insurance companies do.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:58:30
Do these numbers include the current price of bcash and bitcoin gold?Doesn't look like they do.  I do find it interesting that litecoin has outperformed bitcoin over the last few years it's something I've been following over the last few months- it is heavily correlated with BTC but it slightly outperforms it in almost every time frame.
I don't agree with including ETH because it is so new and outside of its huge run up during the first few months BTC has consistently outperformed it since.  So yes if you were lucky enough to take such a large risk on an alt coin from the beginning you would have out performed bitcoin, but over the last 1-10months BTC has had a higher return.

didn't mean to come off as a dick! a lot of mis information is being put out there and you don't want to take chances with the IRS.  Don't take my word for it though, i'm not a CPA, do your own research.  Read the IRS guidelines on crypto yourself and if you really have that much in gains you should be hiring a CPA anyway.  And if it's not that much, then roll the dice and don't pay taxes lol cause it prob wont matter anyway
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:39:38
arbitrage has always existed between the exchanges and between currencies but you're not accounting for the fees and different withdraw limits and requirements that squeeze out a lot of the profit opportunity.

the FDIC is independent of the federal government, and is an insurance company like i said.  By the way, Coinbase (the largest US bitcoin exchange) is FDIC insured
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:02:32
this is incorrect for US tax law- taxes aren't based on cash flow it's based on income so you would pay taxes on the $500 gain.   
Unless you are stretching the sells out over a year after you bought it to move into long term capital gains rates your tax liability isn't really going to change because when you cash other half of that bitcoin you would be paying taxes on the entire amount since your initial investment is paid off.

be carefuk because i think if you transfer your coins off coinbase to claim your newly forked coins, but before you get your BCH, you will loose out on your claim to the BCH
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:17:24
because there is more money and work being done on the development of platforms and technologies related to bitcoin than every other crypto combined. Bitcoin has it's current value the same reason Tesla stock price is what it is- because that is what people in the open market are willing to pay for it.  I believe the true value of a bitcoin should be over 1 million per coin
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:46:12
I'm curious what the interest rate on that loan is?  Also, now that your'e pretty well ahead, have you thought about setting some stop losses to lock in profit?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:08:19
agreed, i've heard some accountants are interpreting exchanging crypto for other cryptos to be like-kind exchanges and thus not taxed on any gains.  I think this is still a grey area and i've heard differing opinions from accountants on this issue
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:22:05
You got Bcash from coinbase? I didn't think this was available until next year?
to answer your question- after the fork (assuming you control your coins/keys) you transfer your coins to a wallet that supports the newly forked coin and you will see your balance of those coins which you can transfer to wherever you wish
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:26:39
I interpret the language about the cold storage hacking to mean their insurance would still pay out in which case coinbase is a pretty safe spot to keep your coins (assuming you are using good usernames and passwords with 2FA).  IMO for people who aren't as proficient with technology and computers it is much safer then managing and potentially losing or destroying the private keys of your coins yourself.  In addition, anyone who has stop losses or wants to lock in profits basically has to keep their coins with the exchange ready to be sold
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:24:52
Wouldn't the limit they have placed on the futures not really make this a viable option for protecting against a large decrease in price?
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:09:22
if you really believe the FDIC insured coinbase is committing fraud on their order book then you should report them, but I think they are making enough money on their 1-2% buying and selling fees to risk breaking the law to make a little more.  CME isn't using bitfinex for their spot price so I'm not sure they are as legit as you claim
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:32:37
do you think if coinbase was somehow hacked or robbed for all of their cold storage (which they say is (95%+) customers would lose all of their funds? Or do you think their insurance would pay out account holders?
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:26:01
Who would have thought someone with no experience day trading would have lost money trying to day trade one of the most volatile assets.  When you bring up buy sell spreads it means you were probably using coinbase and you had weak hands??? no wonder you lost money.

@_date: 2017-12-09 07:03:56
that is absolutely not how the tax laws work in the US! For anyone reading this thinking they can do the same thing, please don't! you owe taxes on the gains, you bought 10K worth of BTC at 1K each and then sell 1 BTC for 10K you have to pay taxes on the 9k in gains/profit
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:26:53
I think it depends on the interest rate- I was able to get 0% for my last car so I put $0 down and took a 72 month loan- and typically I buy my cars in cash, but I decided to leave my money in the market and just pay a higher monthly payment.  It's worked out for me very well as the markets have done very well over the past few years.  I think if you can get any rate under 3% in todays market and you should put down as little as possible and finance the rest

honest question- why would they want to do this? why do they care about the price when they are making money off fees? wouldn't they want to fill as many buy/sell orders as possible to generate the most amount of fees and revenue?  FYI- today was one of the highest trading day by volume they have ever had so I my guess is their servers just couldn't handle the large increase in traffic

@_date: 2017-11-30 05:35:18
They also would need to do that on the 3 other exchanges CME is using to calculate the spot price of bitcoin.  So they would need to sell (probably at a loss) 800M in bitcoin to drop the price to get a max profit of 20% (which is where CME has capped the futures payouts).  That would be a lot of futures contracts to buy (remember each trade has to have someone taking the other side as well) I don't know if there is enough profit opportunity to justify the risk- AND I'm pretty sure that would be illegal anyway
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:17:11
use shapeshift and convert it to BTC (or any other alt you want), I finally did it with my bcash when it was still up around 1250 (I think I got .18bcash to 1btc)
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:34:47
stop posting this crap, you are completely wrong!  You don't pay any taxes for buying bitcoin! is that a joke?  
You do potentially create a taxable event by selling bitcoin- the amount of taxes depends on the amount or profit you made, the length of time you held the bitcoin before you sold it, and the amount of income from other sources in a particular year
