When big money rolls in people will fomo and we will go through one hell of a bull run then eventually correct again. 
 Put in what you can and get yourself into the best position possible. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:50:48
I think big money is trying to squeeze everyone out. I don’t think we will go that low. They are in control right now. They start the dump and the pumps.

@_date: 2018-03-14 17:15:25
They want to shake the BTC out of everyone. Oh hell nah

I would also consider a fireproof indestructible safe.

We need some bear hunters with some serious artillery to blast these bastards back.

Alright that’s it I’m staying put. I have a stack of BTC and BNB I’m going to step out of the market for a few minutes. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:42:57
3..2..1..Blast Off!
     ...nvm
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:37:24
As much as I want BTC to fly, I could go for a fire sale.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:15:08
Who knows the price could suddenly spike and people pulling out will be burned bad. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:40:20

Been up all night!
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray that Bitcoin doesn't sink
And if it does before I wake
I pray Satoshi my bits to take

@_date: 2018-03-15 15:59:20
Last time I tried to time the bottom it didn’t meet my limit order so I caught it on the way up at 8000 then we quickly went to 11kish

Bought back in at 9.7k. I was thinking about selling my loss to jump in lower but fuck it I’m going to chill out and enjoy life.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:31:26

This gave me the feels and giggles. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-10 06:38:47
Before we had the dip I sold my btc to take profit and bought a new Imac. Im glad I didn't just HODL the whole time and took a risk. Now I have a huge screen to watch the show.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:10:18
You can sell back to them yeah but taking your coins out to another exchange or wallet isn’t possible. That was the reason I didn’t do it.
