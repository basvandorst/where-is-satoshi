Thank you for answering my question.
My second one would now be why you don't own Bitcoins anymore when your main interest was personal liberty? 
Couldn't you resist to sell at the 1,000 USD mark in the end of 2013 or was it in between 2015?

This is why I love reddit.
Did the early years of Bitcoin changed your life in a way that you are financially independent now or have you sold too much too early?

How do you screenshot dust?

Or at least should.

Bitcoin dominance is down by 3%.
That tells me that people are buying altcoins now and most of them will lose some of their bitcoins bought with fiat that way.
Price will go down to around $8,000.
You want to buy at that price.
Now just hodl.
But keep in mind that I don't know what I am talking about.

Don't buy this month.
Next buy at around 7k in august/september.
Don't listen to me I don't know what I am talking about.

Okay two last questions I got.
Have you ever thought that Bitcoin would be, by any chance, at around $20,000in the next 10 years?
How have you seen the future of Bitcoin in relation to today as you say "it had lost many of its original benefits for privacy and freedom"?

*USD Coin (USDC) is a type of cryptocurrency that is referred to as a stablecoin. You can* ***always redeem 1 USD Coin for US$1.00 , giving it a stable price.*** 
As stable as the US$.  
You are doing it wrong buddy.

I like those memes because most of the time the opposite happens or at worst you get some cheap buys.
