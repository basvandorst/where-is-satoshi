It's not 'implemented', you don't walk up to a bank and ask them to launder money for you and it's extremely difficult to open up an offshore account, try it yourself, that's not how it works. A bank manager wouldn't know, the wealth management divisions, etc. that handle these transactions are separate and the upper management that oversees the transactions are also separate. A typical HSBC bank manager wouldn't even know where to start with money laundering.

Most business are small businesses, and yes, they do often pay many of their employees under-the-table, and already use shady accounting practices, etc. bitcoin will make this process even easier. If you're talking about mega-corporations, well, with new technologies such as 3d printing, etc. coming along, the number of mega-corps will probably be reduced, and you will see more small businesses.

Tally Sticks were a primitive form of double entry bookkeeping. They weren't substitutes for gold or silver. They were used to account for gold/silver/commodity debts.

It will not be possible to ENFORCE taxation, just like it isn't possible to enforce copyright control with Bittorrent. Thereby making taxation effectively null.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:53:35
People said the same about Bitcoin, it's a matter of time. The question is when. If Bitcoin ever gets a 100 billion+ market cap, etc. people owning bitcoins are going to want a means to preserve their wealth in bitcoins without having to go through an intermediate currency to hold their net worth and without paying the lion's share in taxes and transaction costs.

Gold was used both as a currency, and later as a benchmark for a paper currency to take the place of Gold.
The US Government had to adjust economic policy in order to keep their currency locked to gold at that fixed price, but the gold price still fluctuated on the international market.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:19:58
Having your purchasing power rise is not the issue, the issue is when it falls (inflation/hyper-inflation) as this eventually forces people to select alternative currencies in order to keep their relative purchasing power.

"Anatolian obsidian as a raw material for stone-age tools was distributed as early as 12,000 B.C., with organized trade occurring in the 9th millennium.(Cauvin;Chataigner 1998)[10] In Sardinia, one of the four main sites for sourcing the material deposits of obsidian within the Mediterranean, trade in this was replaced in the 3rd millennium by trade in copper and silver.[11][12][13][14]
So it was originally a commodity-based system, which was used as a universal standard for barter.
"The shekel was an ancient unit[54] used in Mesopotamia around 3000 BC to define both a specific weight of barley and equivalent amounts of materials such as silver, bronze and copper. The use of a single unit to define both mass and currency was a similar concept to the British pound, which was originally defined as a one pound mass of silver.
The Chinese, of course, invented true paper money.
Gold was historically a deflationary currency/inflationary asset like bitcoin because of the fixed supply. You see the major spike down only because of the new found new world supplies.
During the gold standard, people had the option of exchanging/hoarding currency for gold in the 19th century, but they did not, so mythical/imaginary hoarding wasn't an issue during the greatest period of growth in us history.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:52:16
Who says companies will declare everything? Let's say nominally an employee is paid $10,000 USD worth of bitcoins, but under-the-counter facilitated through mixing services, the employee is actually paid in $80,000 worth of bitcoins. It's not possible to enforce. And the rest of the profits they can claim when to bitcoin consulting services or bitcoin charities, etc, which will not be possible to prove ownership of.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:22:49
Source?, and so it was used as a commodity backed currency in any case.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:43:51
Gold prices have risen quite significantly and relatively consistently over the past few thousand years, yet gold standards and gold-fixed exchange rates were in place until only the past few decades ago. That didn't necessarily make everyone horde their gold during the gold standard.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:13:13
You're talking about the Credit theory of money. Why didn't you just say that?
In any case, all those early currencies did in fact have commodity backing, whether private debts were settled with other means doesn't change the historical usage of the underlying currency.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:14:02
Not as is implied, it's not a formal process. They have corporate firewalls. In other words, if you asked the bank managers about the process, they wouldn't know. It's only a few people in their wealth management divisions who can handle this and some of the upper management staff and their legal teams are always aware of this, to an extent. The tactics they use include shell corporations, concentration accounts, etc. all to break-off connections of funds to the original owners. With Bitcoin, all of this has already been implemented and it's even easier.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:44:09
What does trading in a currency have to do with spending? The 2 are not mutually exclusive. People trade in a currency for practical business reasons, people who speculate are in separate categories.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:05:33
You can't enforce it the same way, especially when they are receiving funds for services rendered in bitcoins, how will you know which addresses they use to receive said funds for sales, etc.?, It's not possible to track.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:34:52
It could be a decentralized system and based on cryptographic principles similar to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:26:25
There wouldn't be any credit in a Bitcoin system, as Bitcoin is inherently full-reserve.
Why do you make the latter assumption when the actual historical evidence demonstrates the opposite? Inflation/Hyper-Inflation leads to the abandonment of the usage of the currency in preference for other currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:35:44
Bitcoin is a full-reserve system, so it's no possible to have fractional reserve, etc. Fiat Currency and Fractional Reserve were  originally adopted as transaction costs were lower vs the Gold Standard, now Bitcoin has lower transaction costs vs fiat currencies.
The US dollar rose in value at various points in the 19th century, which is also when the US economy had its highest growth rates in history. Nothing necessarily detrimental about currency price increases.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:51:33
Banks don't lie for Tax Evaders, money launderers use shell corporations,concentration accounts (i.e. traditional 'mixing services' to cut off the trail of funds), dummy businesses, etc. Bitcoin, on the other hand does not require address owners to identify themselves (so shell corporations, etc. do not apply here) and mixing services are already in place (so the blockchain tracking will be cutoff). All Business transactions can be made even without the need for dummy corporations to be established also.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:00:58
They're both commodities with limited supplies, only it's easier to use bitcoin as a currency than gold or fiat money. Wire Transfers internationally can take days, whereas bitcoin transactions can take minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:11:26
As long as the liquidity is there, it is irrelevant, you can divide a $1,000,000 over a mixing service into a 1000 different bitcoin addresses, and no one would be the wiser. Since bitcoin can be anonymous if you choose it be, you can simply create a process whereby you use many sub-accounts which have effectively more averaged sized transactions to layer over a large transaction. With AML/KYC laws it's specifically becoming more difficult to launder money, and HSBC is now paying the fines for their lax regularity compliance, so that world which once existed doesn't really exist anymore.
You need to acquaint yourself with the technical references on these issues. It's not that easy to simply open up an offshore account, etc. Try it yourself, you can learn from your own personal experiences, what I'm saying is vetted and in-line with the global regulatory and financial environment.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:07:53
Private debts were settled with tally sticks, not government money.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:18:44
No, after 9/11, there was a series of new regulations implemented for KYC/AML laws, HSBC was extremely slow to implement these laws officially, and turned a blind eye to new account openings, etc. Now, they are being forced to implement these laws after paying a fine. And it doesn't work like that, because they have to deal with more government oversight and regulations now, just like other banks do.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:40:06
People are even starting to make major purchases such as cars, houses, etc. with bitcoins, so large bitcoin transactions shouldn't mean that much.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:52:04
But what impact did hoarding have an economic progress in the 19th century, which had the highest levels of growth in us history?
Hammurabi was codifying many principles that were already in practice. The actual consensus in the research doesn't suggest what you imply.. The burden is on you to prove it.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:15:57
Gold was originally also priceless until it was mined, just like Bitcoin is being mined today and the fiat continentals hyperinflated, which led to the introduction of gold-backed USDs.
It's the price adjusted for inflation and relative to other currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:14:12
HSBC did not comply with the laws, no. They were supposed to implement new regulatory initiatives like the other banks did, but they didn't. Now they are doing so. Basically, what they did was that you could open an account and transfer hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars with HSBC turning a blind eye. HSBC did not know and did not care about who really owned those accounts, now they are going to clamp down on these accounts and comply. See the story of John Cruz, he's a former HSBC Bank manager, he had no idea what was going on.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:49:58
Taxation would have to be enforced at the controlled physical level, meaning land, natural resources, etc, as the marketplace would exclude the ability for direct Taxation.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:59:47
Gift Economies are even more primitive than Barter economies. They work in tribal settings, barter was designed more for agrarian economies. There is no parallel.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:42:08
What did you refute? Where was the mythical hoarding in the 19th century during the gold standard, which had the highest levels of economic growth in US history? People could elect to exchange their currency for gold and 'hoard', yet economic progress carried on nonetheless.
And the points about commodity money stand. It's designated even in the Code of Hammurabi. LOL
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:45:31
I'm waiting for a significant sum of the couple trillion stored in the Cayman Islands, etc. to be moved into bitcoin. Imagine how much black money could boost the price?
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:31:35
How will the government even know whether or not what amount of taxation will be required when transactions for even sales can be made under the table and put into undisclosed bitcoin addresses?
Many Small Businesses still pay people under the table, with bitcoin, this will be even easier for larger transactions also, and you wouldn't be using established records with bank accounts that have your personal info attached to them, just anonymous bitcoin addresses whom no one will know what is being done with them.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:53:17
It was easier to carry as it was a type of receipt. The Exchequer kept the record of the silver and commodity backing, etc for each tally stick.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:25:39
It was rising when you benchmarked it to other asset classes, FX including the USD is an asset class like any other.  Bitcoin, Gold and USD have all had deflation/inflation, so what?
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:33:13
And Bitcoin has also experienced enormous price swings, but the historical trend going back thousands of years for gold has been a price increase.
Your claim is that hoarding was a negative, but during the 19th century, the US had its highest level of economic growth that it ever had.
Bitcoin is a commodity and a currency, gold is not as easy-to-use as a currency (gold coinage), so paper currencies were created, originally based on gold.
Fiat Money replaced the Gold Standard, as Gold had a higher transaction cost than using paper, bitcoin on the other hand, has lower transaction costs than using paper. Therefore, just as there was an advantage to using fiat money over gold, there is now an advantage to using cryptocurrencies over fiat money.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:34:39
People don't leave currencies because of deflation, they leave because of inflation and there is no such thing as 'liquidity preference'/'time preference' in reality. Business continues as is irrespective of time, downturns are caused by increases in the organic composition of capital caused by technological productivity, which results in the falling rate of profit. The firms employing older, less efficient means of productions are then priced out of the market and go bankrupt, and asset prices decline to the point by which they can be afforded by the new lower rate of profit and so the process then restarts.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:05:59
Do you even know what a concentration account is? You have no idea what you're talking about, you just take extreme paranoid speculative theories and then try to portray them as facts. Those AML laws apply to everyone, regardless of account size.
Those regulations are put in place precisely to stop money laundering. Many other banks did comply unlike HSBC, and now HSBC is complying. 
In any case, all of your speculations are irrelevant, because bitcoin replaces the banking system, and therefore also creates a better way to launder money, as mixing services and account traceability becomes much harder with bitcoin than with the traditional system.
By the way, HSBC did not necessarily directly help them, they just had loose regulatory policies, where people setup shell corporations and wire transferred funds between various accounts, and instead of investigating, HSBC simply chose to ignore it, but now they are forced to follow it.
So in conclusion, bitcoin is a superior way to launder money over traditional banking.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:41:27
Money laundering is specifically being cracked down on, and HSBC was fined for not following regulations, they are doing so now. Swiss Banking Secrecy is literally on its death-bed, so swiss banks are finished. For the Cayman Islands, etc. most of the banks there are actual correspondent banks of US/British/Canadian banks and they are now being forced to follow strict regulations as well. The game has changed dramatically in the past couple of decades.
What you're implying in your comment is that you don't anticipate for bitcoin to ever become big, so then how can you logically support it? If Bitcoin transactions increase in general, both legal and illegal, they wouldn't be possible to distinguish as bitcoin is inherently pseudo-anonymous.
Mixing Services are the equivalent of Concentration Accounts used by large banks, they eliminate any connections in the flow of funds. Bitcoin has the infrastructure set-up to replace the current money laundering infrastructure 100%.
This is why it's good that regulations and taxes are being increased, this will force people to seek bitcoin as an alternative.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:10:05
No it isn't. Those Bank Managers wouldn't know where to start. Try it. You should educate yourself. Banks have to follow AML/KYC protocols. It works like as I've mentioned. And the mythical loopholes are being closed, which is the point. Bitcoin provides an avenue of escape.
Instead of making all these unsubstantiated speculations you should first try to get an offshore bank account for yourself and see just how difficult it can be.
HSBC did not use any loopholes, they BROKE THE LAW by being lax on their compliance, and they are being punished for it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:39:17
No, it's more difficult for everyone, bitcoin is more easy for everyone. There is no proof for what you're saying. Hence, you see the deal with swiss bank accounts being investigated. Swiss Banking privacy is dead. AML/KYC laws apply to everyone.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:19:15
Your records would be completely digital, you can have 2 different sets of books to none-the-wiser, and there would be no names/identities set to any of the bitcoin address, unlike with bank accounts. You can even pay the supplier with bitcoins (off-the-books), so the government wouldn't even be able to enforce a VAT either as they wouldn't be able to track production sales at the supplier level. The option is not going to stop people from using third-party bitcoin escrow services, for example, so contacts could be settled outside of the existing legal framework.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:29:27
That's why I suggested a decentralized system, maybe the system can automatically allocate ownership of said contracts to each specific bitcoin account and use encryption.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:51:49
TorBroker et. al can be shutdown by the SEC if they get too big, because you're still dealing with physical purchases that can be tracked through traditional means. With a Stock Futures Market, you're dealing with synthetic futures contracts created and traded in a decentralized setting.
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:36:16
I'm talking about cash-settled futures, this would be a means to tie in the secure transaction to the decentralized exchange. The 'Colored coins' concept looks pretty interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:06:15
There were periods of time in the 19th century where the USD did actually increase in value, yet economic progress carried on.
The price of gold also rose in the 19th century:
Paper money was used to substitute gold, as the transaction costs for using gold were higher to the system, and fiat money transaction costs were even less, but bitcoin has lower transaction costs than even fiat money.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:56:43
Most of Bitcoin's original economy was stimulated by the Silk Road, and now it is stimulated by the SR successors like BMR, etc. If it wasn't for this liquidity backdrop then bitcoin would have already declined to zero, but even after the major crash there was still use for it in the niche black market. As Bitcoin becomes more prominent, other industries will also start using it and add more working liquidity to the system. So yes, there is a real reason for bitcoin, certain goods are banned by the government, and bitcoin is used as an alternative channel to facilitate the transactions of those goods, in addition bitcoin also has extremely low-transaction costs relative to the traditional banking system, giving users an incentive to use bitcoin over a bank or a payment service.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:26:25
By the way, I'm not saying that it's ever going to be 'impossible' to launder money. What I'm saying is that the new laws are making this much more difficult than it used to be, and bitcoin is a free and unregulated and uncontrollable alternative compared to the traditional system.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:34:13
It wasn't fiat, neither the shekel, nor in babylon:
"The Mesopotamian civilization developed a large scale economy based on commodity money. The Babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think of it today, in terms of rules on debt,[8] legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices and private property. Money was not only an emergence, it was a necessity.[30][31]"
So, it was barter/commodity money, then after a long period, paper with gold/silver backing, then proper fiat. Bitcoin is simply going back to the gold-type commodity money system that was already in place.
And the reason why gold is specifically preferred as a benchmark is because it has limited industrial supply/demand usage while being small in quantity, it is used to benchmark the paper money supply and to gauge its price, hence the historical gold standard.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:48:27
It was succeeded by paper receipts, which was the predecessor to paper money formally backed by gold. Tally Sticks were originally just receipts for loaned silver, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:59:06
More Trading only increases liquidity and improves price discovery, there are no disadvantages to that and as has been mentioned, business transactions in a currency is not the same as speculation, the falling value of a currency only encourages people to perform business exchanges in other currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:38:15
They will spend and they do spend bitcoins, when bitcoins give them advantages that other currencies do not, I already brought up black market usage. Furthermore, if policy-makers in traditional currencies make massive errors causing their own currencies to hyper-inflate, bitcoin would end up as a relative haven.
