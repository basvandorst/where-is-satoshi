Hahaha! The political correctness of this post is making me cringe.  
Let us go to github and see how many of these brilliant women who could have "just put it all together" are contributing to bitcoin sourcecode.  
And the answer is?

That IS funny

This case isn't about justice. It's about setting precedent and trying to deter future development of such markets.  
It's a shame and infuriating a young, bright mind has to rot in jail in order to set an example

You brought up a good point - there is no price tag for being at peace with the world. In many ways, and without getting into details, he says, bitcoin and ability to buy drugs safely on the internet saved his life.  
My dog is a good guy - better than most people. He's given away and donated thousands of bitcoins. Does he regret it? No, he strongly believes he helped bitcoin become what it has.

Yes, I am serious.  
Bitcoin addresses look like this: 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2  
  
  
So what you need to do now is open the app and in the bottom left corner of the screen click "Request Coins" 
At the top of the next screen there's a "copy" icon. Click on that to copy the address to clipboard and paste it here.  
  
Or  
  
Since you went with the wallet I recommended, you can open the app, click on the barcode to make it bigger and upload the screenshot somewhere I can see  
  
Also, don't forget to backup your wallet before you receive any coins. You can do so by opening the app, going to Menu -&gt; Safety -&gt; Back up wallet  
  
From what you said in your posts, it seems that you need to do some reading about bitcoin. You can start here:   
Also, make sure to read through the links in the sidebar of this subreddit.

Hello young man!  
Yes, I have an idea. It's not a solution to your problem, but it will satisfy your initial aim of getting small amount of bitcoins. Steps bellow:  
  
1. Get a bitcoin address.  
a) if you have android phone, go to Google Play store and download the Bitcoin Wallet(it's the one with ~1million downloads).  
b) if you have iPhone, you can use blockchain.info or something else(I don't even know what's available on that platform except for web based wallets)  
2. Post bitcoin address here as reply to my post  
  
I'll send you some

But it worked out well. Back then it was only me talking to him - now he responds

Are you sure?  
Let's do some math.  
Bitcoin network is capable of 7 transactions per second. So that is 420/min or 25200/hour or 604800/day.  
Now let us assume that people of London(cause fuck the villagers) take your prudent advice and get themselves some bitcoin.  
Also, like you say, let's assume that banks won't let you access your money, so people in rainy London are left with nothing but bitcoin.  
London population is 8.5m  
And let us be very conservative in our estimations and say that each person will choose to make only one transaction per day.  
So what do we get?  
The answer is that John in London will have to wait about 14 days for his transaction to confirm(which would actually never happen, but we will not get too technical here)  
  
I'll leave the scenario where all EU decides to adopt bitcoin something to ponder on your own.  
  
Engage with reality!  
As much as I love bitcoin, it's currently nothing more than a geek toy and intellectual curiosity.  
It's a joke when you put it in global context with some numbers.

You are right there - fees changed people's behaviour. Furthermore, I'd say your fear about pushing people away is well founded.  
Back in 2010/2011 I was showing everybody I could how this thing worked and how to send and receive transactions, and it would cost nothing. People who had at least two braincells would very quickly recognise bitcoin was something to pay attention to.  
Fast forward today, I'm hesitant to show anyone how bitcoin works because of the fees. And even when I do, people's reaction is: "What do you mean it just cost you $0.20 to send $2?"  
While bitcoin may still fulfil it's promise in the niche markets, it's a failure as an everyday payment system

I wonder if we already have a word for it.. maybe.. database
@_date: 2016-09-26 23:37:22
It was in 2013. They were the first pub and one of the first retailers in UK to start accepting it.  
Also, what's remarkable, they integrated bitcoin with their POS system. It's not like other places where they come to you with a smartphone or a tablet

Blockchain is not a webserver - it's a database.  
Can you host a webpage on mysql?

Yes, few gay men and few black people bought some bitcoins too.  
We are still waiting on lesbians

There is no use case for "editable blockchain".  
If there is no open competition for mining, then there is someone in control of that blockchain and has to be **trusted**
@_date: 2016-09-22 18:00:07
Yes, but what you do not understand is that there is no increasing the capacity. It just cannot be done with the current storage, network capacity and CPU power.  
If you increase the capacity, bitcoin dies. Simple as that

@_date: 2016-09-27 11:51:52
Nice way to avoid the question.  
I do understand it perfectly. But the new fork is not Ethereum anymore where code is law and in terms and conditions it explicitly states: if there is any ambiguity, the code is ultimate deciding factor.  
It's now Vitalik's coin, where terms and conditions are: we change things as we please.  
Are you having trouble understanding this?
@_date: 2016-09-22 19:22:55
Of course miners are fine with bigger blocks. They are using specialised equipment while being connected to fast networks.  
It's the average user that matters
@_date: 2016-09-23 13:08:11
Why the fuck are you still using coinbase?  
Everyday you can read about people getting scammed by coinbase.  
When are you gonna learn???

Pembury Tavern in Hackney  
Poped in about half a year back just to ask if they still accept bitcoin - the answer was yes.  
Didn't order anything as I was in a hurry, but judging by google reviews food is decent
@_date: 2016-09-27 12:06:56
If people who didn't have vested interest were asked the question which chain they want to support, they would have stayed with "code is law" fork, but most had money tied up in the DAO. So the thinking process went like this: fuck the ideology and this project - I want my money back.  
This really goes to show who the people are and what they are motivated by in Ethereum comunity.  
The ideology behind Ethereum was sound, but now it's just a failed project that nobody will touch because they have seen how easy it is to confiscate money and change the rules of the game
@_date: 2016-07-24 22:22:41
Fixing the fucking capacity problem of the network.  
Bitcoin will only see mass adoption if people can pay for anything, anytime with no/little fee.  
7tps and 20cents per transaction while having to wait for confirmations is ridiculous.  
Currently the only expansion that is going on is black/grey markets where bitcoin is the only/cheaper alternative and smart entities taking positions in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-05 08:00:20


Exactly. If they want you in jail, you'll be going to jail. And don't forget this fight is gloves off - they will do illegal things to gather evidence.  
  
Regarding your original question: Let's assume that we're in a parallel universe where evidence and logic does matter.  
In my opinion, how this would work, they'd do bitcoin network analysis to figure out who's doing what and then use other means to gather evidence around the illegal activity(seize packages, do surveillance IRL, etc) and present that as a case.   
Unless Bitcoin transfer is directly linked to illegal activity(you sent your coins directly to SR and they had access to the server, etc), it could be circumstantial evidence at best. However, ask yourself a question, if you're in front of jury accused of illegal activity, and all you have is one address between you and illegal activity, would you feel confident you'd walk?
  
@_date: 2016-07-25 08:41:29


Yes and no. If, like you say, this is someone with 100k, then they are using bitcoin as store of value and yes, $0.20 is very cheap for this purpose. Bitcoin is used this way currently and there's no problem there, but if we want to use it as a payment system(the only way, in my opinion that we see mass adoption), then $0.20 is just ridiculous, not to mention the network just won't work if a sizeable amount of people decide to adopt it.

Saying that a company is good(or evil) is the same as saying submarine can swim.  
A company is not a conscious being(at least not yet). To be moral you have to be able to distinguish between good and bad in the first place.

Let me stroll down to the bank in the middle of the night, while shots are being fired and martial law is declared so I can wire some money to an exchange and buy me some magic internet money.  
Good thinking OP, thanks for the advice
@_date: 2016-07-06 11:05:57
A company is not a moral entity - it can not be good or evil.  
It's behaviour is determined by the owners of the company, who are people acting out of their self interest.
