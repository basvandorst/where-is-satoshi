That's great! Thank you guys so much for the work your doing. I can't wait to try the beta, no matter what condition it is in.

I agree. Although he seems to have a problem with Bitcoin itself, not the crypto space as a whole. He's said good things about the blockchain, Ethereum etc. He just has a problem with it being used as money I guess.

That's pretty cool

Yes, because of its reputation as a safe haven asset it lost ground when traders largely decided there was nothing to worry about in the economy, and then Trump got elected so the stock market went up because reasons. Gold is still up 8% on the year and it will recover it's losses very quickly when people start to catch on to the real conditions in the economy. Bitcoin went down for a while too, but those that bought the dip are doing very well atm. When gold resumes is bull run, it will be for the same reasons bitcoin is on the rise; its an alternative and safe haven from faulty and failing fiat currencies.

It's happening! I'm not ready to celebrate until the price service I use hits that magic number

What a nasty, slanderous article. Whether or not we agree with him, this is no way too discuss ideas.
"but imagine you or someone in your family being a delivery guy unknowingly carrying/delivering illegal fireworks, sounds a lot worse now doesn’t it?"
No. No it doesn't.

I do cheer for a market downturn. Because the longer this charade goes on, the bigger the collapse will be and the more pain and suffering will be inflicted on innocent people. The longer a fake recovery seems plausible the more people will spend money they can't afford to spend and make investments that will eventually collapse. Bubbles need to pop. The sooner he better.

I personally invest in both bitcoin and precious metals. Gold and silver areally massively undervalued and are very solid investments. Who knows, bitcoin might outperform them in the next few years, but I am 100% they will go up and it's a lot safer than bitcoin. It's important to spread out your investments and I personally think metals and crypto go hand in hand.

Goldmoney.com but point taken. The reason for the comparison here I believe is that gold is historically human beings go to for money. Out of all the currencies in practice today it is the only form of money with inherent value (besides btc, imo). That's why this breakout is important; gold represents real world, tangible value.

Gonna throw out $100,000. If there are huge global financial disaster events that play out this year, I don't think it's all that unlikely. And I won't have much competition up here ;)

Congratulations! I admire your commitment.

I like your investment advice but I'd up your silver a little bit. There's a lot more upside, in my amateur opinion.
