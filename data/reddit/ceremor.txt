I just hate turning off autorotation because by default it forces portrait mode. I'd use it more often if I could tell it to stick in landscape for when I'm reading things. Of course there's apps for that, and I do use them.

Show depicts bitcoin as a legitimate currency with a solid use case that frees itself from fiat's inherent issue of being centrally controlled and subjected to society's mores by banking institutions that decide what is and is not appropriate for people do with their money.
THEY'RE NOT TELLING PEOPLE BITCOIN IS JUST A VOLATILE STOCK TO GAMBLE THEIR SAVINGS ON LIKE WE DO??? HOW TERRIBLE!

Oh come on.
If a kid asks for 100$ in cash it's because they know they can buy a toy or a game or some candy with it or whatever
If they get 100$ in bitcoin what the fuck are they gonna do with it? They're 9, I assume they don't have their own bank account, they're not handling a coinbase account. They're not gonna be spending it on some website that accepts bitcoin on the internet. It's of no tangible value whatsoever to a 9 year old. It's just weird.

Am I the only one who finds it weird to prosthelytize to a 9 year old about your favorite digital currency when they're too young to actually care about it at all?
These kind of posts just make me uncomfortable

I've been seeing Contrapoints break down barriers all over reddit. I never thought this day would come but I'm loving it.

Because it's a dumb title and a dumb post.
"HISTORY MADE"
No it's just some shitty clickbait.
