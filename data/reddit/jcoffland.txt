What I mean is that there are many servers on the Web that if hacked would compromise the entire CureCoin system.  This is not true for Bitcoin.
The first problem is that CureCoin has a server which reads Folding points and uses this information to distribute coins.  This is centralized distribution and a single point of failure and you're trusting CureCoin to continue to do this fairly for now and into the future when it could possibly be worth more money.
The second problem is that there are work servers all around the Internet at Universities which have been authorized by Stanford to issue work units on the Folding network.  We are reasonably confident that these servers are well protected but if compromised someone could claim to have done work for Folding which they had not and thereby get points and thus CureCoin.  This has not been a major concern for Folding in the past but now that it could be profitable, it is.  So now you're trusting grad students all over the world not to steal from you.
The system is flawed, period.
 you should disclose that you are one of the CureCoin devs.

Issue 3 is far from solved.  Scalability is a huge problem.  There are proposed solutions but right now Bitcoin as it's currently implemented would have major problems with an order of magnitude increase in transactions per second.  The other big problem is the ever increasing size of the blockchain itself.  If we suddenly started adding 1GiB per day you can bet your ass there would be tears shed.
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:24:58
Yeah and the CureCoin developers give themselves 3% (edited) of the profits.  Plus they have centralized control of the distribution of coins.  Their centralized servers gather publicly available data from Folding and enter it into the CureCoin network.  If they screw this up or get hacked the whole coin is compromised.  If Folding get's hacked or any of the 100s of Folding work servers which are run at Universities around the world gets hacked the coin is compromised.
I tried to work on these and other issues with the CureCoin developers but they responded quite hostility and charged ahead with CureCoin as is.  As their website says, they have no affiliation with Folding or Stanford University.

Despite all the adamant claims to the contrary SHA-256 ASICs could be used for other purposes.  For example, they could be used to deter SPAM by requiring email senders to compute a proof-of-work as a hash of the email text they are sending.  This would impose a small time penalty for people who send only a few emails but it would require huge computing resources to send massive SPAM.
Another possibility is to fight Sybil attacks by requiring a proof-of-work in exchange for some service.  ASICs could become a required tool to participate in a distributed network.  For example, you could require one hour of ASIC time to create a new user IDs on the network.  Basically you would require a hash of the user ID plus a nonce that had a certain number of zeros in front of it.  The more zeros the more difficult it would be to create a new ID.  This would greatly deter the creation of huge numbers of sock-puppet IDs and thus Sybil attacks.  Sybil attacks are one of the biggest problems in distributed protocols.
Basically any protocol which can utilize double SHA-256 proofs-of-work could utilize the piles of now-obsolete Bitcoin ASIC hardware.  Use your imagination guys.

I've been accepting donations since 2011.  I've counted over 13K downloads from unique IPs in the last 12 months alone.  Despite this significant number of users I've gotten only a handful of donations totaling a few hundred dollars no where near enough to cover the literally 1000s of hours of development time I've put in to this project.
I don't think 100BTC is at all unreasonable.  How much do you get paid to work for 4 years?  However, I'm not asking people to fund past development.  If you think donations fund Open-Source you're dreaming.

It could even be a model for musicians.

Finally, I want to point out that I'm not asking for donations.  I'm selling a color coin which you can redeem later for support, votes on new features or a chance at winning a 3D printer.  Also, if the coin behaves like a stock then it would hold value and people could speculate on it.

This was actually his weakest argument.  I've drunk the Koolaid and fully believe in Bitcoin but we still must remain critical.
In his deposition, Andreas tried to tie having identities forced on Bitcoin users with the dangers of getting robbed when you share your credit card information with a vendor.  Although I'm completely against any government regulation which enforces IDs tied to Bitcoin addresses, Bitcoin under such regulation would still be more secure than the credit card system we have now.  With the current credit card system you essentially give away your secret keys with each transaction.  Not enforcing IDs is important but we have to come up with a more sound argument than it would be, "endangering my personal financial security," since that's just not true in the way Andreas implied.

Oh stop picking on Petamine.  They are in a downward spiral and it's not really their own fault.  There is no way they can keep up with the increasing difficulty and make a profit with the high cost of their solar power and the fact that they are paying full price for their ASICs unlike companies such as Bitfury who manufacture their own ASICs and therefore don't pay retail for them.

You are confusing two different ideas.  Yes the transactions are already ordered in the sense that the transactions from one block come before the transactions in the next block.  However, within a block the transactions do not require any particular order.
In fact, if you look at the transactions in a block from first to last, it's even possible for an account to temporarily go negative as long as the account balances work out correctly by the end of the block.  For example, say you have three accounts A with 3 BTC, B with 0 BTC and C with 0 BTC.  You could have the following transactions in a block:
  C sends 1 BTC to A
  B sends 2 BTC to C
  A sends 3 BTC to B
In the end each account has 1 BTC and all is well even though both accounts C and B went temporarily negative.  Of course, in this case, you could reorder the transactions within the block to avoid any negative balances.
The main point of the proposal is to deter the miners from ignoring transactions which don't pay much in fees.  Right now it's completely up to the miners or mining pools which transactions they include in a block and in what order.  Currently, there is an advantage to reducing the block size by ignoring some transactions because small blocks will propagate across the network faster.  If one or more miners finds a new block at about the same time those who form small blocks have an advantage over miners who form larger blocks.  The miner or mining pool whos block is accepted, gets the Bitcoin reward, which is generally much larger than the sum of the transaction fees.
Gavin's proposal orders transactions within a block in a way that allows miners to come to a consensus as to which transactions should be included in the next block.  Presumably this would allow miners to know that they should wait a little before accepting a new block because they can now tell when a block is a little light.

I was thinking sellers would take their goods to a center to be examined.  Many sellers go to the post office anyway.

They could simply match it against a picture.

That does not mean they are not selling from another account.  Miners must pay their bills and continually buy new hardware.  It's very difficult to stay profitable.

That assumes the blockchain only grows linearly which is based on the fact that the current implementation has a fixed upper limit on block size.  Since it's likely that the max block size will be increased in the near future that assumption does not hold.  The real question is will the blockchain growth exceed common disk size and cause problems in the near future.  This is quite possible regardless of theories about the longterm.

The keyword here is "resistant".  If Mike Hearn had said, "no algorithm is ASIC proof," then I would agree.  As stated he is wrong.  Many proof-of-work algorithm's have already demonstrated they are ASIC resistant.  Whether ASIC resistant proof-of-work algorithms are a good idea or not is a completed different question.
The important question is what will happen to Bitcoin when the only people who can make any money from mining are ASIC chip manufactures who have access to the cheapest power.  This is too small a group and this is already happening.  Look at PETA-mine, who is no small player, but is likely to be pushed out of the market by September of this year because their solar power is not cheap enough and they are not manufacturing their own chips.
The argument that transaction fees will eventually be large enough to fund more miners is insufficient because we don't know how long we might have to wait until that is true.  It's totally possible that Bitcoin will fail before the transaction fees become larger than the mining reward.

Not all uses of blockchain tech require the level of security of a system that transmits money.  So yes you can run a blockchain for other purposes with out the same level of incentives.

It's pretty easy.  You keep a hash table of all the public addresses you know the private keys for.  Run all the public keys for every transaction you see on the net through the hash table.  If you find a matching transaction which moves money into one of these known addresses you generate an equal spend to one of your accounts and send it out.  All automated.  Would take fractions of a second to execute across even millions of known addresses.

The large-merchants-cashing-out-creates-sell-pressure argument doesn't hold water.  People have to get Bitcoins in the first place in order to buy with them.  This creates an equal number of buys to the merchants sells.  That is unless people are buying with Bitcoins they were previously holding.  So we must conclude that sell pressure is not created by large merchants but by holders cashing out, either by buying merchandise or by simply selling their holdings.

It's funny how many Bitcoiners don't get that Bitcoin is still in its inflationary phase.  3,600 new Bitcoins are created every day and that will continue for about the next fours years when it halves to 1,800 per day.  Much of these new coins have to be sold to cover mining cost.  The USD price of Bitcoin would be going up right now if it weren't for the downward sell pressure caused by mining.  Even if some miners hold or sell off exchange.

A HUGE problem with your calculation is that the average person can likely only recall around 10,000 words easily even if they are able to recognize 45,000.
It would be interesting to setup a Web site where users think up 12 English words at random.  Then give them a score based on how unique their choices were.  My guess is that there would be a relatively small set of commonly chosen words, which many people thought were unique, that could be used to greatly reduce the time needed to brute force brain wallets.

People already hire inspectors in China for large manufacturing orders on a regular basis.


How would it slow delivery?  The shipper would have the package inspected before shipping at a post office.  Then shipping would proceed as normal.  Also, this wouldn't have to cost a ton.  The seller already pays Ebay, Amazon, Paypal and credit card fees for what they do.  This would eliminate those fees which would offset the cost.
The thing is Bitcoin is awesome but we still have to rely on existing trust systems.  My idea boils the trust problem down to its essence and provides a solution.

I'm willing to work with the CureCoin devs but they essentially refused and then tried to attack my credentials and shut me up.  Sure they started out with nice words but what really matters is actions.
The first thing I would ask of the CureCoin project, is to make it 100% clear to those in the folding team that they should not get angry with Folding if there is a problem with their points.  Naturally we are happy to help and do our best to resolve problems with points but we have limited resources.  We already deal regularly with people angry about points.  Now that they might be worth real money there's a real possibility of people freaking out and giving us hell over the mistakes that can and do happen.  This should be one of the first items on your knowledge base page.
Secondly, CureCoin should work with us to create a CureCoin 2.0 where signed certificates issued by Stanford which represent points are accepted directly into the CureCoin blockchain.  This would eliminate the possibility of incorrectly allocating CureCoins on the CureCoin side.  Securing the work servers could be handled by Stanford issuing an allocation of CureCoin points to work servers which they could grant to users for folding power.  All secured with public-key crypto.  After these changes the only point of failure would be at Stanford and could be kept under close guard.  However, I must point out that I cannot guarantee that the Pande Lab will choose to allocate resources to this.  That's not up to me.
If CureCoin can address the first issue ASAP and start working towards the second issue I would be greatly appeased.

They tanked because of a post over at bitcointalk showing how PETA can't possibly keep ahead of the curve with the high cost of their solar power, the fact that they are paying full price for their hardware, unlike the guys manufacturing the chips, and the fact that it will take several more weeks until they pay off the debt they owe on their current hardware.

This is nonsense.  Inflation does matter and has a huge effect.  It would not effect market cap as much if all coins were on exchanges and up for sale but only a very small fraction of coins are available at a certain price and far more are not even for sale at any given time.  Downward pressure from miners selling Bitcoin in order to cover their costs has a big effect.  Anyone who has researched mining knows that these days profit margins are tight.  This means that many, if not most, miners are selling a large portion of their mined BTC out of necessity.  This is up to $1.4m USD per day at current prices.  Even if much of the selling happens off exchange, that's a lot of daily downward price pressure on a market with a $5.5b market cap.

That makes no sense.  Dumping all Bitcoins that will ever exist on the market now would have a huge effect.  That total is a very large amount of money that would completely upset the current price.  Because the Bitcoin market is currently so small a few million dollars easily moves the price.

Why would you need $5,000 to buy DISH?  You can put spending money in a Bitcoin wallet and pay for things like DISH and whatever else and buy more Bitcoin to replenish the account periodically.  It's not that hard to buy more once you've got a linked account with someone like Coinbase.  As it becomes easier to pay for more things this way it will become more convenient to do so.  People now mostly have Bitcoin savings accounts but there's nothing stopping you from opening your own Bitcoin checking account.

Regardless of the cost incentives it's clearly much harder to create ASICs for Litecoin and even more difficult for a coin like Quark.  A coin which used 100 different hash algorithms would require an excessive number of gates in an ASIC but is not infeasable to design in software.  The more gates required the less advantage an ASIC will have over a standard CPU.  A SHA256 ASIC gets its speed from its many repeated SHA256 units which all operate in parallel.  If the units require more gates you will get less on a chip.
I want to stress that I'm not arguing that ASIC resistant proofs-of-work are a good idea just that they are possible.

I don't at all agree with the claim that merchants cause sell pressure that is often assumed to be true on In order for people to buy stuff with BTC they must some how acquire the coin in the first place.  This either comes from mining, or purchases with fiat.  There is very likely just as much BTC being purchased by buyers as there is BTC being sold by sellers.  As sales in BTC go up more and more BTC will be held, even if just temporarily.  This means that merchants actually drive the price up even if they sell their BTC immediately for fiat.  The only argument against this is that some people who were holding BTC are cashing out via merchants but then the real problem is not the merchants.
I believe this falsehood is perpetuated by those who only imagine two options with their BTC holdings.  Either hold or sell.  There is another option.  Hold some and regularly buy or earn some BTC which you use for purchases.   You can have a savings and a checking.
