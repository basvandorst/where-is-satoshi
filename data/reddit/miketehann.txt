Awesome! also unlike OpenBazaar is indepedent from the interests of corporations.

YES!! take a look at OneName Passcards, sadly used by OpenBazaar, so consciously locking all its users.

Thank you for taking the time to write this post, Im reading as much as I can and re-evaluating my post.  
Could you please clarify the diferences between Passcards and Blockchain ID?

Bitcoin Addresses and **Store** Names are very different things. The store branding is crucial to its success. Please just realize that you are handing the keys of the door to every store on OpenBazaar to OneName; and is a terrible mistake. I will stay away from this now, I do wish you the most success. 
Please do point me to the Passcards specs or code, I will take a look.

The option been a long string on nonsense characters!

Actualy the reasson for this is just that OB1 and OneName got funding from Union Square Ventures. All stores names will need to be registered via OnaName, that is how they will make money.

Do you realize that the long string of characters is not viable for stores, thus making the registration a necessity? 
Anyway, point me to the specs and code of onename passcards. Whatever happened to OpenName, no one said a word about that.

Notice the only difference are namespace /id , instead of /u and /i of OpenName.  
Questions, what happens when they move to a new blockchain as OneName said they would? If you registered using the OpenName protocol on Namecoin.

I respect the work you do, I think OpenBazaar is brilliant and that it is key to empower peoples fair trade. Unlike corporations like Ebay or Amazon, just trying to make their investors rich out of unfair fees.
Arent we trying to fight corporations? If so, why are we giving them the keys of such an important piece of the puzzle.
Im looking into OneName thinking that I may be infact wrong, and that things will be just fine. But then I see that OneName does not have a real solution.
First it was OneName the service, show me one person using it. Then they came up with OpenName the open source protcol, what happened to it? Today I found out about PassCards, where is the code and the specs?  Is it Namecoin, or is it Bitcoin Blockstore? Will they migrate everyones Namecoin IDs to it? How will they do so without access to private keys? 
Why do we need a company to offer us a protocol (that is nowhere to be found), that changes things on daily bases, and that doesnt even know if is going to be Namecoin or Bitcoin for storage. Do you realize that if is Blockstore some of the data will be centralized as servers are needed to store all the ID data?
 
Why cant we just use regular domains instead? They are well proven, very cheap (helps in part with sybil attacks). 
I may be wrong, please show me some PassCards code, and a clear path for the OneName offering.

LOL, OneName just pwned OpenBazaar. 
Not such thing as open when you sell all store names registration to a business! They where suppose to use Namecoin before they got the funding. We need to fork this shit and keep it open!

This is the first time I  address the issue, See my answer to CC_EF_JTF, on why a long string of characters is not viable. Stores will need a name for certain. Before it was OpenName, suddenlty is Passcards, Blockstore, or whatever. OneName cant get its things right. Do you realize that this stupid idea could jeopardize OpenBazaar? Sure you got the funding from them, but unless you are Nakamoto, there is no free lunch.

Yes, is called Namecoin, is open source and under the control of a community instead of a per profit business. Satoshi Nakamoto worked on it.
