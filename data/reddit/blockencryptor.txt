What are your Requirements? I would say Bisq is a good Alternative, it's a decentralized Exchange where you can trade with fiat. It's not as convenient as coinbase, but you use it instantly without any KYC signup.

Yes, it is possible. Don't know if there are any official was, but you can also install a Linux Distribution on Android and run it there.

Don't put all your money / savings into bitcoin. It can still crash near zero. There can be a bug in the software, regulations, speculation or whatever, it's just risky. In addition you are alone responsible for it and there is a risk to lose the keys or get hacked and your funds are stolen.
I don't want to say bitcoin isn't great and you shouldn't invest in it, I just want to say be careful and spread the risk (not with altcoins).

In addition you get a ridiculously high fee error when you try to broadcast your raw transaction. So, really no issue anymore.

You should checkout bisq. 


One downside is that you will need a small amount of btc as security deposit.

Sounds like you didn't use a generated password. Depending on the strength of your password, you can maybe bruteforce (basically guess many and common passwords) it. There are many tools available for this, just a short google search will bring you to this site.
It's worth a try for three bitcoin. If you have used a long generated password, I don't think you can recover the keys.

There is an option to export your private keys.
Wallet -&gt; Private keys -&gt; Export
Be careful, this will save your private keys unencrypted.
