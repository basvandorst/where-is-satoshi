So I guess it was on me after all!

My data connection and calls default through wifi as opposed to cell towers.  When I am away from wifi, it reverts to towers.  I suspect that I may have been pulling time temporarily from my employer's WiFi access point, as the "Use network provided time" setting had accidentally become unchecked.

I have had 2 factor on my email for some time and there have not been any failed attempts to access it.

Genius...I got through, but now I am getting throttling errors, which has been a constant but normal issue with their website.  I should be able to access again in 1 hour.  Thanks for your help (why didn't they suggest this!?)

Total return 50 years = 6.64% S&amp;P, 5.29% silver, 7.41% gold.  Hard to pull total return on treasuries out of BBrg, as  40+ year data on an index of 30 Treasuries is hard to come by.  Also inflation adjusted appears to make returns on TSYs negative.  I could combine sources and back into something, but I expect it would only be confirmation of what I already know.

My phone's clock was off so it wasn't syncing correctly.  I reset and everything is good.

Well if I lost my phone that is one thing.  Their systems goofed, and I guess I am paying the consequence.

If it helps, 25 year total return on A rated Industrial 30 year bonds is -3.68%, so Treasuries, would likely be a couple percentage points less than that.

Thanks...that gives me some comfort.  I have since been able to access my account, set up 2 factor, and change my password (for good measure).

I didn't notice because tmy phone was off by about 90 seconds.  I could be wrong, but I am not sure that many would be offended by a troubleshooting suggestion from customer support.
