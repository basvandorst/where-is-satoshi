Granted it is one of the most available indicators, I would say it is a fair indicator of price direction. With this markets volatility there is literally nothing that can determine price. Only tools that expose potential fluctuations based on CURRENT data.

I am not advocating its effectiveness for the final time. Only stating that it's a tool that measures market orders only for the precise moment that you are viewing it. The second before and after is irrelevant because, like you mentioned, there are ploys that indicate a massive buy wall as well as the reverse scenario. Do you understand what I am telling you?

Source: my eyes. I understand all markets have sell walls, it's healthy. I was simply making an observation. lol

GDAX has a pretty solid graph depicting sell walls on a price chart if you are just starting to understand market movements. I usually keep a few exchanges open at a time though.

There are some heavy sell walls up ahead lol

Yes I understand what you are saying and AGREE with you. My argument was that out of the tools we have, order books are one of the only indications of price deviation for that current point in time. I am not using it as a tool to invest my own money, only as an idea of where other are hedging their bets in relation to that specific moment in time. Regardless of manipulation.

Wasn't an article just released saying Putin wanted financial institutions to avoid creating barriers for crypto tech?
