Kleinman died in 2013 according to wikipedia, Satoshi wrote "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" in 2014 using a known account.   Less likely that Kleinman was Satoshi.

The future of decentralized fractional reserve is where the customer determines the reserve ratio, not the bank.  In the past, the banks had total control of the depositors money.  In the future, I, the customer, determine the 0% - 100% reserve ratio, it's up to me, and the bank will profit accordingly.  
With 0% you get a pure [time deposit]( AKA CD model (not unlike the current bitfinex flash rates).  With 100% you get a basic wallet service like blockchain.info with very little risk and very little return.  
On top of this is obviously the trusted integrity layer of the market.  Trusted banks are able to charge more fees based on their reputation than less trusted banks that invest your funds in sub-prime magic the gathering trading cards... /s

Bitcoin.  On the street in isn't trivial to verify that gold from some guy is genuine.  With Bitcoin it's just a matter of minutes.

This.  He can't possibly be maintaining 100% positive feedback on his LBC account.  Even by creating new throwaway accounts, how can people be selling coins to a non reputable account without an established track record?  
Seller beware.  Also, if it's too good to be true, it probably is.

Fair enough, but I think we are getting into semantics.  I can also put clean clothes into a washing machine which doesn't preclude the fact that my clothes were possibly clean in the first place.  
The fact is, laundering can also include just plain mixing, so one cannot necessarily connect intent with the act every single time.  Thousands of coins -- dirty and clean alike -- get sent to exchanges / mixers every day with absolutely no intent to clean dirty money.

The act of laundering money itself does harm to no one.  It is often used to cover up illegal activities.  It's the activities themselves that do harm and not the money laundering. Just because one has laundered money is no indication of wrongdoing.  
AML regulation to "follow the money trail" is just one of many tools law enforcement uses to catch criminals, but it creates many ridiculous laws / situations (some already mentioned here.)  In the most extreme cases you will get your cash confiscated if you carry too much:

Previous survey: with "how many bitcoins do you own" and "how long have you been ... dealing with bitcoins" there seems to be slight truncation at the higher ends.  Suggest adding a 100+ and a "Over two years" possibility.

I agree in spirit, however, until intent / wrongdoing is established one cannot distinguish between innocent mixing and laundering.  Because I am required to submit ID to exchanges, the law assumes that every trader is a potential money launderer, which, as you say and we both agree, is not perforce to money laundering.  This is classic putting the cart before the horse.  A social contract of giving up liberties to provide law enforcement with this AML tool.

FWIW, I've seen people post bitcoin signed messages to verify that they own particular addresses but choose to use newly created throw-away accounts to retain their anonymity.  Seems like a good thing to be able to do.

In both Bitcoin and Litecoin transactions are instantaneous.  What you are talking about are confirmations.  For small transactions (coffee shops, etc.) double spending isn't a large problem that impacts the bottom line.  No more than counterfeit cash is for small transactions.
Not condescending or cocky, this applies to both bitcoin and litecoin.

Just a note: according to the article, it's only for their SWREG solution for now.  I don't know what their client list is, but I'm pretty sure the bigger companies don't use SWREG, so it sounds like a slower test rollout at first.

You are correct.  What I suggest is not fractional reserve, but a lending system to replace fractional reserve.  "The future of fractional reserve" is indeed to abolish it and replace it with something that both lenders and lendees can make money off of.

The author of the report actually mentions gold as an example, too.

Gold dipped about 20% at the end of 2008 but quickly recovered after about two months.  Insert obligatory caveats (Bitcoin is not gold, past is no indication of future performance, etc.)

A published financial audit of their books would be nice, but that's not what this is.  It's just proof of BTC solvency.  
Many companies I've worked for co-mingle revenue with operating funds in that same *bank account*, but **not on the books** which is where it counts for most financial departments, compliance officers, auditors.  This proof of solvency doesn't show this one way or another.
