It's so contactless they can steal your crypto without knowing. 
Using NFC doesn't make holding/transfering crypto safer...
I guarantee we start seeing YouTube videos of pen testers breaking it.

I didn't read into the device in more detail but would hope they'd use a Secure Enclave within their device, similar to Ledger. That at least helps mitigate some concerns. That is also how Apple/Google/Samsung can use their Pay services on the phone with NFC. The transactions on your phone funnel through the TEE chip which is running a permissioned/separate operating system and less compromisable.  
Edit: Even if they are running a Secure Enclave... who do you trust more with your security Apple/Google or Sony that has had major breaches in the past.

Does it duplicate on Bittrex as well?

I've noticed price differences between coinbase, gdax and ethereum price. The low was $171 on EP but the lowest on coinbase when refreshed multiple times was $176. It always seems like minimum $4 different.
Any ideas why?

I should have clarified my statement more. "Millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin". This is just one article but there are many more if you are looking for more legitimate proof. They can drop the price of Bitcoin without blinking due to the amount they have stockpiled and that is only including one dark net website, not the rest they took over as well.

Due to the government collecting millions of Bitcoins in the dark net markets I fear there are a lot of "bubbles" to be busted again. I like the concept and adoption to real-world market of bitcoin but I personally wouldn't invest in it.
