I am sorry but you're totally wrong here.. They would have gotten an immediate cease and desist letter in case any wrongdoings would have been found. After two months those wrongdoings would have been found, or atleast some part of it unconvered. Especially if the scam is so easy to spot as some try to let you believe in here ;) How do I know this? Because I work for more than 15 years in compliance orientated roles. Furthermore a court hearing is not always necessary, you perhaps know the difference between the various subpoenas. The first, called subpoena ad testificandum (pronounced "ad test- te-fi-kan-dum"), requires you to testify before a court, or other legal authority. The second, called subpoena duces tecum (pronounced "doo-seez tee-kum"), requires you to produce documents, materials, or other tangible evidence. Based on my experience they got ordered to provide documents or give information to the CFTC supervision officers. Based on that they're able to make an assessment if a cease and desist order is necessary, again its not common that if something is clearly wrong (go back to the earlier part of my story) that this order has not yet been issued.

Finally a meaningful post in this whole thread..

Probably yes, see how the Bloomberg article coincides with the settlement date of the futures, which is basically today?

You're assuming that there will be a court hearing, which again probably isn't the case and how would they prepare for an exit / disappearing act? The whole world knows who are the beneficiary owners of Bitfinex / Tether (well the latter does not have beneficiary owners as far as I know). Stop spreading misinformation, Mr. Redditor..

Yes because there is demand for a USD pegged cryptocurrency. Apparently not everyone has full faith in BTC ;)

Actually they would have gotten a cease and desist in case they were under government scrutiny and if they would have ramped up their scam. Furthermore calling someone a moron doesn't prove your point, it rather disproves it.

The important part of your sentence is 'was'..

Still wondering why this post does not have more upvotes, this sums it up exactly why you should not put your faith in the charlatans and politicians which moved to Bcash, but instead should put your faith in the engineers and mathematicians who designed bitcoin in the first place.
