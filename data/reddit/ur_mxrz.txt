It sort of is. The R8 is just a more practical, less showboating version of the Lamborghini Huracan. They share the same engine, transmission, electronic systems, suspension, steering, and major structural carbon fiber bulkhead sections.

Clearly you can't recognize a facelift R8. It is new.

This looks shopped. I can tell from some of the pixels and from seeing quite a few shops in my time.

Yes, even after 2% yearly inflation, I still got a couple of hundred dollars extra. I did however keep it in mint condition and every service, I had them polish the housing and the sapphire crystal. 
I also found a buyer that was looking for a specific serial number range, for his collection... one with a clean bezel, no etchings.

I had a standard Submariner that I paid full retail for, got it serviced three times at a cost of $500, and still managed to sell it for a profit. Replaced it with an Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean, which I will probably keep forever.

2K will get you three S9i's for a total of 42TH delivered four months before the GMO B2 (for anyone looking to order now). And that excludes coupons, which can cover the cost of power supplies... I wonder what kind of power supply GMO is planning to sell with the B2, because if you consider no PSU should be loaded at more than 80%, this unit will need to be at least 2500watts, and that might cost a lot, compared to Bitmain's 105$ APW3++ 
@_date: 2018-06-06 01:08:53
220V obviously... just like the S9 power supply. Or if someone really insists on using 120V, then two power supplies can be used.

This article mentioned a few things one can buy on dark web markets... including encryption breaking services, which made me remember this old ZIP file I have, protected with a long password I forgot, so I thought, let's do it, for the lols... I googled Bitcoin Montreal and found a walk-in exchange downtown. Went downtown, found the place, gave them 50 CAD, they handed me a slip of paper with a wallet address printed on it, loaded with 7 BTC. Eventually, I gave up my dark web search for someone who can crack my ZIP file, so I figured I'd check if I can just return the piece of paper with the wallet address... Went back to the exchange and they offered me 65 CAD. I thought they looked a little too enthusiastic about this trade, so I said nope, went back home and actually started following bitcoin... My 7 BTC was worth 83 CAD, not 65... I was so happy about it, and was hooked.

I didn't know better back then... Was more interested in short term gains, and over the next couple of years, I bought and sold on regular basis, cashed out often... Only about a year ago, I setup regular monthly deposits, and started to holdl... What makes it much easier is that I finally have a day job I really enjoy, so there is much less temptation to cash out or day trade.

First batch of Halong/Innosilicon T1's doesn't seem to be any more power efficient than a nearly two year old S9. Was expecting better. What they need to do next is release Batch 2 at a more competitive price.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:57:19
There is plenty of us that will keep our S9's running regardless of cost...

DHL only charged me one tax (~7%) importing S9's to Montreal, Quebec.

Based on what was posted on Bitcointalk, from a couple of users. It's quite possible the MyRig power supply isn't that good, and the draw might improve with something better like a Delta server PSU.
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:00:28
The designers are Innosilicon. Halong is either associated with them or bought their tech.
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:18:15
Yes, it's getting very old but I'm afraid that Bitmain has little incentive to release the S11 anytime soon. They now have tremendous buying power at TSMC which allows them to keep making S9's for dirt cheap, therefore they can wage price wars and sell them for as little as few hundred dollars, to keep a competitive edge against superior technology from competitors... All the while, they engage in ASIC expansion into new algos, where per-mining before publicly announcing the existence of the new ASIC is highly lucrative for them... example; during December and January, each Antminer X3 was making anywhere from 1000~1300 USD per day... each A3 was making 500~600 USD per day, and who knows how long they had the E3 running before they announced it... Seems like they are forgetting us, the SHA256 and Scrypt miners, the ones that made them rich af in the first place... shame.

It isn't, it isn't even 2 years old yet... It was introduced at the end of next month, two years ago.

-ck on Bitcointalk mentioned that the efficiency will keep improving with new firmware... however, it seems that currently, Halong's advertised numbers aren't being replicated by customer delivered units, so most T1 owners aren't seeing 16TH at 1480w right now. Halong used a cherry picked unit to generate those figures... bit deceptive imo.

Already known. 10nm Samsung chips;
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:37:16
No, 7nm mining chips will not exist for a while... 7nm tech is not even large scale production ready, even Intel is still working out issues with their 7nm lithography machines and Samsung is only beginning production based on 8nm FinFET LPP tech, and there is no way that miner chips will get first dibs...

Are you talking about the person you're replying to specifically, or do you mean it's impossible for anyone to be neutral in this? Because it certainly is possible, and I wouldn't be surprised if most everyone who isn't from the "litigation happy" USA, will agree that this is not the way to go, and in fact, will make all of us, in the crypto space, look bad. On the grand scale of things, this is just petty and detracts from the collective effort of promoting adoption and projecting a sense of stability and maturity.

Thanks Captain Obvious.
The T1 draws more than the S9, hence my comment.
