Alright, thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:00:32
So transferring to my phone is alright? 
Should I be investing in a hardware wallet, or possibly making one? (I have tons of MCUs that could be used for this).

Wish my node showed up there!

Toyota pickup with nice tires and locking front / rear diffs.
Manual transmission.
It'll go anywhere you point it! 
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:41:24
Yes it is, thankfully storage is pretty cheap right now. Make sure you won't hit any caps with your ISP either

You dropped this:

Have you looked into Localbitcoins?

If you can't install new circuits (add breakers, run wires, install boxes, etc) then you'll have to run extension cords from other circuits. If you can't do that then you should reconsider where you're miners are being housed :)

I'll try to get a node started next weekend. Already running a full node. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:23:08
Plan to have lots of free disk space- and then some for the future. I believe the blockchain is just over 150gb right now. I bought a 1TB HD and installed Ubuntu with xfce on it. Took a week to sync and it has been running smoothly since.

This is the most likely explanation I've heard so far.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:49:31
What events led up to this?
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:20:03
Also if this is something that the mods simply don't have the manpower to handle, maybe voting in a couple extra mods to factcheck, etc? Maybe not even extra mods, just a few people chipping in with factchecking efforts occasionally.

My node hasn't been showing up :( I don't think I set it up right.

:) 
What do you mean by interesting? If I knew more what you meant I might be able to help more. BTW the above command actually will send BTC so DONT DO IT lol

Alright then sounds like you answered your question �� 
In all seriousness, I've tried mining at home in an apartment, you really want to have a house that you own, that is the next best thing next to a dedicated building. 
EDIT: Also get something to measure exact amperage draw so you can see exactly how far you can push the circuit. Possibly check building codes for when it was built. A lot of times sparky's run wire that can handle 5-10 amps more than the breakers that are installed. It's rare, but if so you can swap those out.

Understandable, just pointing out possible reasons for you receiving negative comments on this post. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:43:51
I'll keep one copy in fireproof safe and other in safe deposit box.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:13:56
Lots of FUD. People would be a little more open to believing if you were to post some sort of proof (with all personal information removed of course).
With all the false information being passed around related to Bitcoin, it only makes sense that people are going to be skeptical involving any BTC related stories.
I feel for you though. Shitty situation. Hope it all works out. :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:46:11
I think it's because the mempool is getting cleared
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:18:12
I would if I was near my node!
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:00:16
Same earlier. did it for litecoin too. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:20:11
Is TEMPEST a thing on OLED's?
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:11:43
And for the paranoid that may not even be a new measure! :)
