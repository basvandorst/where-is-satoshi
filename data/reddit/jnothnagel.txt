This thread has only served to prove that Bitcoin fanboys are just as blindly biased as Apple fanboys, completely unable to see any fault in your precious Bitcoin/Apple.
That being said, I'm a fanboy of each and find this comparison laughable on its face. Both have the potential to coexist and be perfectly successful without the need to argue for one or the other. It's just silly.

Yikes. That sucks man. I fortunately haven't had any issues with coinbase, so I can't necessarily sympathize, which probably means my point will just fall on deaf ears, but....
Given that they're in on the ground floor of BTC and their business model relies on the long term success of the BTC protocol, I would think that it would be against their best interest for negative stories to spread about their company or the overall protocol. The values are so flimsy right now that a small series of negative stories could crash it. You clearly experienced a breakdown in coinbase's security procedures, and I hope that your public postings will bring this to light for them to understand the importance and fix it, but I doubt that it was malicious or intentional. It just feels that way when it's so close to home.

I think you must have caught a promotion or something with the $0.01 buying fee. From what I can tell, it has recently changed to a 1% rate across the board. But it used to be $0.15 + 1%.

Stocks may or may not be dead and/or a failed experiment, but using a single day/week/month/year as evidence of that is like people who claim global warming is definitely a hoax because it was chilly in Houston on a Wednesday in August, or that global warming is definitely real because it was warm in NYC on Christmas Eve.

I think you’re just doing it wrong.

If an anti-abortion law crossed President Paul's desk, coming from a GOP-controlled House and Senate (a distinct possibility after 2016), do you seriously think he wouldn't sign it? Or any of the other stereotypical conservative policy positions? ... He would be running for re-election without the support of the GOP base if he were to actually veto any of those bills.
The question isn't whether a presidential candidate would personally legislate anything. The question is whether he would sign or veto those things that will potentially cross his desk.

Other than what he's working on for prison reform, and the occasional (but not recently) hints of isolationism like his father, Paul falls pretty squarely in line with the Republican Party. Basically, he's just another Republican trying to wear the disguise of a Liberterian. There is nothing wrong with being Liberterian or Republican, I just don't happen to personally agree with ... well ... nearly everything.

So again, what you're hinting at (that he WOULDN'T sign something that he campaigns on being anti-&lt;thing&gt;) is really an utterly ridiculous hint. There have been numerous occasions in the Senate in which he has simply voted along party lines, regardless of what an ACTUAL Liberterian would do. What would make anyone think that he would behave even remotely different in the oval office? If the GOP base lifts him into office, there is a zero percent chance that this "Liberterian" would veto an anti&lt;thing&gt; bill that a GOP Congress would put on his desk. His principles are to get elected to higher and higher office, not true Liberterianism.

I agree. Though his competition is Ted Cruz.

A libertarian (well, "liberterian") candidate that accepts virtual currency...? 99% of redditors need no more convincing of who they're going to vote for, despite ... well ... nearly everything else about him.

Thank you for confirming that he's wearing the disguise of a Liberterian when he's really just a politician who just says what people like to hear (like basically all politicians). One of the things I respect about Ron Paul is that he is balls-to-the-wall genuine Liberterian, uninterested in bending his beliefs for votes. Rand, however, has a balls-to-the-wall genuine belief that he wants votes and will say the things that poll well, often in spite of his claim of Liberterianism.

A currency that can fluxuate 10-20% in a matter of hours is hardly "sound money". It's a fun risk-roller-coaster to ride, don't get me wrong. But it is not "sound money" right now. Don't kid yourself and others.
