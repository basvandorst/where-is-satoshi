Not exactly the way you’re describing - but very close.  
For a few years, I was day trading crypto.  I won some, I lost some, but overall, I was obsessed with price action and checked my phone no less than 30 times a day.
I finally decided to stop trying to accumulate btc by day trading and began focusing on accumulating it by only making purchases.  The only time I buy bitcoin is when it’s coming into a 7 day low or something of that sort.  I also apply this to the other main coins except XRP because I’m just not convinced that coin is going to survive with the advent of state-backed currency options.
As a result of this very resolved strategy however, I find myself, to your point, not making any other frivolous purchases whatsoever.  Every cent that I can afford to lose goes into bitcoin.
So not exactly what you’re describing, but pretty close.

Only took me like...4 months to work this gem out in my head.

This chart is both encouraging and discouraging (short term vs. long term)

I think most people understand that 1 Satoshi will be worth more and less as Bitcoin rises and falls.
The example above is fine for illustrating that concept.
Here’s where it gets weird for me.
So let’s say Tron is trading at 500 Satoshis and that equates to 5 cents.  When bitcoin rises in value, not only does Tron become worth more by Proxy, but it also will tend to gain Satoshi value during bull surges.  Why is that?
Again, I understand that the value of a Satoshi makes the overall value of the coin rise.  What I don’t understand is why the coin will also move to say 505 Satoshis as well.
The volume is clearly a mirror/scaled image of Bitcoin’s value, so I don’t honestly believe that every alt coin sees a flat 5% volume spike when Bitcoin does.  That implies an even distribution of people sitting at their computers across all pairs buying at a relative rate as bitcoin?  Come on.
That part makes no sense to me, honestly.
