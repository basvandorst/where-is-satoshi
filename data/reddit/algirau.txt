I invest for them and take 10% of profits. Im in the heart of silicon valley where everyone has some crypto hedgefund on the side. Im managing 6 figures of mostly mine and a few family members. I would rather execute a HODL strategy and store it safely, and then teach how to buy/sell and store after so they dont lose out on current gains. It is well understood that my beleif is that this will be a binary solution, BTC will either go to $100K or will fail. I don't see why it will ever remain around $15K. I don't plan to sell a single Satoshi yet I dont know if family members have stomachs for these swings.
Disclaimer: this is fictional. No profits are being taken. Thus no taxes are owed to IRS. This is a fictional scenario to illustrate how one may deal with investing in Bitcoin.

Any sale you need to account. Moving between banks should not matter because that is never realized gains for you.

How about no charts and just HODL?

Don’t buy B-cash

Hundred dollars? Look the IRS would never come after you for anything less than a few thousand. Don’t worry. Just be a good citizen and HODL your BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:33:43
Unless is is a shit ton, I wouldn’t worry.

Then go talk to a tax professional. I am not one. Sorry I can’t make this decision for you.

Not if you don’t act like a b*tch. HODL and retain your bitcoin.
