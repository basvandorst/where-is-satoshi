It seems immoral, but at the same time how could someone get such an incomprehensibly random series of characters by accident?

Yep I delete my posts because my other account is of a similar name and my friends know it, and the reset password feature seems to not work.
EDIT: Also- what the fuck could I gain by posting this as a scammer?

I too made this mistake and yes I realise it was stupid and yes I too cannot go back in time but yes I would also like an answer.

They are not the same value in BTC. As K_oSTheKunt suggested, I am not an idiot. 
And this is a completely different situation to the one linked above. My phone vibrates and says "Bread: You've received blablabla". I am not checking my wallet and the price is oscillating by $800 and I'm thinking "Wow free money".

Now I'm getting random payments of around $30. Never the same (in BTC). What the fuck is going on?

You’re forgetting that it is actually likely to fall unless it rises instead or stays the same.

Again, tired and hungover. I did a fucking master's in infosec and am a security consultant so I understand the difference. Please do share your understanding of, for example, the Diffie-Hellman algo?

I'm too tired to think of the security implications of that but here's a screenshot.
