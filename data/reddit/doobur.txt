Honestly, I think it would rise
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:52:40
Not really sure about that... I mean, it got pretty damn close to that number and I'm very glad I decided to take the plunge, and kinda sad I didn't buy more. 
But you never know what kinda thing would bring the price that low. Obviously the real hodlers refused to get shaken out. Even at 3100, now we're seeing more people buy in, and more people realizing they should've just hodled.

I did not watch the entire video, but no I'm not worried about Libra
It doesn't change anything about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is literally meant to be anti-centralization, Libra is the opposite. I think the demand for decentralization is more important than the demand for an "insta-currency"
What facebook is doing is making it easy to datamine to sell to advertisers/labs. That's i. They partnered with big companies and made "crypto" their buzzword. It's really no different than Venmo, but they knew it would make waves if they called it a "crypto". 
Here's the thing, they're giving other companies access to that data BEFORE they sell it to them by letting them mine their own data. For the small fee of...$10 million. So their discounting the data by having companies draw their own correlations AND broadening their platform's reach because massive comapanies like Visa will accept it - and most of the infrastructure is already there with facebook. Like how easy it is to create an account on the web by hitting the "sign in with facebook" button. So now, instead of eBay and paypal - it's Facebook and Visa. 
So, here's the dilemma - Will fast, easy, but controlled money beat it's decentralized counterpart?
My bet is...no - Because the reason for Bitcoin's existence is corruption. I think the real demand will happen as each governed currency on the Earth is subject to manipulation, it'll start with the least stable countries, as the marketcap grows it will become more trusted and integrated into societies, along the backs of the failed experimental monies that did not have the first mover advantage. 
What I think Libra will do is force legislatures to be written for entities labeled as "Crypto Currencies" so legal protocols will settle legal battles. I think it may provide a tax haven for those who trade goods and trade currencies. I think it will make it easy for Bitcoin to be integrated into societies. Then more people will flock to money that actually protects and grows value.

Why's that
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:31:40
I don't really day trade, but I do skim off the top every now and then. When we hit 13k the other week I pulled $1000 off the top just because I didn't really see it sustaining. 
I put $500 of that back in at 10.8k. So it's a bit of a win. I don't think a lot of people are willing to wager their positions right now because of the insanely bullish sentiment in the BTC community. So I'm thinking we'll see it jump up because the price seems to be stabilizing.
I really do think we'll see 20k by the end of this year, then it'll get crazy. If it gets crazy and to good to be true I'll probably take a happy helping off the top, but HODL my primary position.

I absolutely see 50k in 5 years
If Bitcoin matches the marketcap of Apple, we'll see a 50k Bitcoin. 
I don't see why a truly decentralized global currency that is being adopted at an alarming rate (due to government manipulation of it's own monies) can't reach the marketcap of Apple.
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:36:06
I think people will see it go to 20k, then regret selling.
They'll hear news about how it's supposed to go to 100k. Buy in at 30k. Then get dumped on at like 50k down to 14k. Declare it dead. Rinse and repeat.

So much negativity...
Guys, like... a month ago we freaked out that it broke 10k.
I'm realizing that I probably spend too much time trying to read the market sentiment (knowing helps me sleep at night) but in all honesty, the fundamentals are so strong, there's no reason why we should get to at least 1/7 the market cap of gold, putting us at 50k per bitcoin

Listened to this last night,
I like Antonopoulos, he makes a good point when he says that we shouldn't be pushing people to use bitcoin because its still kindve clunky to use but that we should be working toward a world where bitcoin isn't as unwieldy.
He made me feel much more comfortable with my investment in the space. I'm willing to deal with the unwieldy entry point for crypto currently because we anticipate the infrastructure being built into the world like that of the internet (which he mentions he's also been a giant proponent of since the beginning)

A lot of people in here are saying they don't like the line
The line is perfect, the Bitcoin logo has 2 lines, the Sat logo should have one. I like that it references the US dollar (the same way the Btc logo does) because so many people already associate that logo with currency. 
If it was just an S in an @ symbol it would look as innocuous as any other logo.

@_date: 2019-03-28 20:28:24
To me its highly likely
Unfortunately I think we'll see a few more unsubstantiated pumps that will result in higher lows.
I think once we see a bitcoin ETF and stock tokenization we'll see the price go up, then we'll see crazy fomo because the price will go up, it will go parabolic, take a major dip, scare people away until the next phase of actual useful integration.
But I certainly see Bitcoin becoming a method of payment on Amazon, etc. Which will give it more utility to the general public.
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:57:47
@_date: 2019-03-27 18:23:44
Tax day, like April 15th?
I'm also told that the historically the 1 year mark before the halvening usually cues a bull run. 
I'm afraid of another bullrun founded on fomo, I'd like to see stock market tokenization and other prominent integration before another crazy jump. 
Then again, the writing is on the wall, it could be that we see a slow and steady rise before that stuff is truly implemented. 
Still, a lot of people an to think the price will rise at an crazy parabolic exponent, what do you guys think?

I like btc because its the most prominent truly decentralized currency in the cryptosphere
(devils advocate)
But what makes you so sure a more complex crypto won't dethrone bitcoin?
What I'm most afraid of is bitcoin losing its brand power due to the infighting between bitcoin cash and bitcoin core, apparently people are afraid the lightning network is some sort of layer that leaves the purpose of the true btc protocol defunct.
Not sure I believe it but I am afraid that what with the nature of bitcoin being "anti-government" that the evolution we see it go through will stray further from its original intended purpose. 
Just afraid to put my eggs in one basket, everyone seems to think bitcoin is head and shoulders leading the future but how do we know its not yahoo vs google and microsoft?

Who cares if they create methods of tracking bitcoin within their own environment.
The fact of the matter is that you CAN use bitcoin anonymously if you want to. It will still be decentralized with a limited supply.
I don't care if someone wants to create an easy way to use bitcoin, it will increase adoption. Its good that he's motivated by selfserving interests. CAPITALISM BABY

Hey Guys,
So my youtube feed is full of videos saying that "this is the last chance to buy low" "bull run imminent" blah blah blah
Which is a little weird because I've been following the scene for a few months now but for some reason everyone seems to be in agreement that right now is the calm before the storm.

Uuh yeah. I'm the product. So what
Bitcoin has more utility than just being anonymous. But it is certainly a usable optional feature. 
It sounds like you buy into btc for anonymity alone, but that's not the only reason for it.
I get that you're fighting the good fight but I honestly don't care if they sell data for advertising. It's good that data of all sets are being analyzed for purpose. This data at least has an anonymous (but more cumbersome) option

Well guys, nothing in the news, price declining. Really bad sentiment in the daily thread. 
Just dumped a heavy one into btc, fuck it.
I always hear everyone say you take the stairs up and the elevator down but I swear it's different with bitcoin. 
I feel like whales just wait until it's a good time to go heavy and wait for this period where everyone gets skiddish.
EDIT: To add to this, everyone of my inexperienced friends keep telling me they're waiting for lower prices. Last I heard 6k was "reasonable". The last time I heard this, 2k was "reasonable" @ 3.7k. Decided to go heavy.

I actually like this a lot although i think the line though the S should go straight through it
I think we will need to start referencing Satoshis with slang because I'm sure we will eventually start transacting with the btc protocol with conflating the idea that you'll be sending a whole Bitcoin
You can't put a long ass decimal on the price of a candy bar, but you can certainly say it costs "2 sats"or "200 sats" whatever it may be, should scale pretty well.

You guys kinda suck. 
Everyone just takes stabs at bitcoin "core" and ignores the major issues with bcash. I don't trust anyone over there now. At least the bitcoin sub is generally level headed and open minded (maybe not during this bullrun...) 
Like you're gonna have to accept that you went with the wrong fork. Clearly one is dominating the other, and will be layered with other tech to keep the system scalable to accommodate for what it lacks compared to bcash. Bitcoin "core" is right though, security is most important.
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:37:19
OP Comment got deleted but I typed this whole thing out so I'm going to post it
A *Bitcoin* is a representation that someone somewhere did the work to mine a Bitcoin. It's a representation of the time/power needed to ensure the network is open/secure.
Bitcoin's value comes from the fact that an open, decentralized, permission-less network is inherently valuable as a structure. It's valuable because it's necessary to have a monetary system that no one controls. The bitcoin reward is the incentive to support the network - without actually having to pay someone to support it.
The protocol has a built in method of increasing the value of the network by halving the reward programmatically throughout the network timed cycles. Meaning - every 4 years, you'll get less bitcoin for supporting the network, making bitcoin even more rare and valuable. 
As long as we have the need for a monetary system that no one is able to corrupt - bitcoin will be valuable. The necessity is becoming more and more apparent as more and more government currencies are manipulated and compromised. 
I see bitcoin as a win/win. Either it becomes the world monetary protocol or it keeps the 100's of FIAT currencies in check.
I don't see it completely dominating the world or dying completely. But I do see it doing something in between.

But I get why people defend it, bitcoin is a protocol founded on certain ideals, some people feel those ideals have been compromised by things like the implementation of the lightning network. 
I personally think it's stupid to refuse to scale the technology. But we do need to defend the logic of the base layer. 
Although, the whole r/btc sub calling bitcoin cash "the real bitcoin" I think tarnishes the bitcoin brand a bit

As I understand it, it is 2 separate chains forever. 
If you have reservations about either side of the fork you might want to re-assess your portfolio. 
It makes me a little scared that our money would be subject to forks in the future because we'd have to constantly weigh utility vs brand value. 
Which is why I think implementations like lightning are necessary, to improve the utility of bitcoin without compromising the brand.

This is kindve what I like about btc though. To me it's obvious we need some method of sending money through the internet. Let's say it winds up being libra or some other stablecoin. 
Don't you think it's going to be pretty important to have a store of value that isn't affected by a singular government or corporations influence?
Like say some decentralized stablecoin is the go-to way of sending USD value (so you don't necessarily need 3rd party centralized services to send money to and fro like venmo or PayPal) Wouldn't it be good to have a quick and programmed way to exchange into a worldwide decentralized store of value? Just in case the stablecoins backing value is subject to inflation etc?
I'm thinking it's a pretty liquid hedge to keep fiat in check. Like "Hey gov't, Don't fuck up your currency, because we could always use bitcoin". I think it helps prevent corrupt governments/banks from manipulating money by creating an immediate way to engage in out of state commerce, if necessary, to fight tyranny. 
So, we got a Zimbabwe and Venezuela fuckin up bigtime, and but people can still engage in commerce even though the local currency is fucked up. 
I can see other governments having similar issues and millions of people flocking to an untouchable currency. So I'm getting in now...

@_date: 2019-06-04 21:41:54
I think people freaked due to any sort've forseen drop and it created a bit of a landslide
Which is honestly why we need more widespread adoption - a larger marketcap is harder for any 1 person to manipulate.
I think the idea is that fidelity, td ameritrade, etrade etc getting into the scene will be good for mass adoption. Really looking for that ETF to be approved.
Imagine if everyone's financial advisor had the option of putting ~1% of their userbase's portfolios into BTC.
Bitcoin is an absolutely insane game changer and threatens the livelihood of millions of people who are ingrained in the current system. There's a war raging between who can adapt and who cannot. The change won't happen overnight - but its likely to scale like the internet has. It's utility is too important to cast aside.
It's like the battle between the ice movers and refrigeration.

Absolutely agree, and I think the fact that we KNOW no character is safe is what caused the immense amount of tension the entire episode.
Which is why I don't get the complaints, people we're CALLING for some characters to die and then were disappointed when they didn't. The show isn't good because they kill main characters, it's good because when characters die - its sudden, but actually makes sense. Not just death for the shock value.

@_date: 2019-04-26 00:15:07
Honestly, I'm glad. Good ideas need competition. 
That said I honestly believe, because Bitcoin has the grass roots movement and market share, it will be the winner of this scenario. It also gives those inclined more time to accumulate. This space is getting bigger and better before our very eyes and the busts after the booms scares the public so much the prices become low enough for a regular guy like me to develop an impressive portfolio.
The people now have true economic freedom and the value of that is still truly unrecognized by the majority. Let's thank god old habits die hard and buy this shit up.

This is what worries me about the market, but also makes me insanely bullish. 
Whales can continue to manipulate, bc the market cap really isn't that large - BUT
if you really believe in the tech and the future of BTC, you know the marketcap can be trillions of dollars. 
Reminder that a 1 trillion dollar marketcap puts us at like 50g per bitcoin.

I dunno dude, like, did you ever use a gift card?
Why can't you just be happy someone is at least trying to make the advertisement industry more friendly to users. 
I don't bitch about not getting cash on my birthday. I go to home depot, use the gift card my grandmom gave me and be happy with my new power drill. 
Why do you gotta make it more than that. Anything supported by a blockchain will only further substantiate the space.

Just saying its going to replace fiat doesn't make it so
The US government completely controls the US dollar, it will assuredly fight to maintain control over the economy. I don't believe the people at the top will relinquish control so quickly.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:13:17
Yeah but you could argue the same with gold
-I hold bitcoin because it cannot be confiscated
-I hold bitcoin because it has the ability to transfer to anyone in the world through a network without permission from anyone else.
-I hold it because it is finite and not subject to quantitative easing or inflation 
-I hold it because it is truly de-centralized and massively adopted compared to every other crypto currency
- I will accept it in exchange for my goods/services
- I spend it in exchange for your goods/services
Right now regular people don't trust the bitcoin protocol and network (in the same vein as the internet back in the 90's)
but the utility vs our current system today is very real

Thank you for this post, I've tried to look for an honest explanation as to why the space is so divisive between btc and bch. I was called a "sock puppet" or a "shill" even though I was just looking for an honest explanation. The only thing I was able to gather was that people like Roger Ver were able to manipulate it due to its small volume.

So I get that quantitative easing will devalue the dollar.
But I guess I'm wondering whether bitcoin will  become more valuable because the infrastructure is more useful than our current system or if it will become more valuable because the US dollar is becoming less valuable.
You may be right, I guess its not only the US economy bitcoin is up against. It's a hedge against $ and a better technology than we've had previously, but also a world currency - So value is added from everywhere in the world.
Maybe I'm more worried about government infrastructure changes that are substantiated by military. I'm having a hard time accepting a 1 million dollar bitcoin in 10 years. But then again, thats because I still value a candy bar at $1, but in 10 years it might be $10.

Probably could use satoshis, I'm not a programmer so I don't really know.
I would assume Brave's incentive to create this system was to make money, probably found BAT to be the most appropriate for that circumstance - nothing wrong with a company trying to make money. 
No its not bitcoin nor does it rival bitcoin's use case, but that doesn't mean its completely useless.
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:26:08
Ok well, I don't think it's going to rival bitcoin's use case (truly decentralized, finite, blockchain currency/store of value)
Blockchain is a technology that allows for decentralization but doesn't require* it. Bitcoin requires it. But I don't think that we should just call it a shitcoin because it's centralized.
That's like saying Amazon is stupid because the CEO gets a paycheck. I think it's a pretty cool way to incentivize people to unblock ads, which will in turn incentivize businesses to advertise in brave because they can somewhat guarantee exposure because users won't just block it.

Yeah taxes, so if people are transacting with more valuable money, they lose out on their taxes. 
So they have to adapt their model to compete
@_date: 2019-09-19 19:41:37
I'm making the case that tax plans will need to be devised as fairly and competitively as possible or users will begin to transact in competing currencies. 
I believe the US government does a poor job and has created a system wherein which the masses are subjected to needless debt. This system is the banking system. They make too much money for what they offer and there now exists a technology that does not rely on their services for transaction. I'm electing to transact through a different means until I regain their trust.

Guys, I think the end of the quarter is going to catalyse btc a bit
Personally, I'm throwing my commission check entirely into btc.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:14:50
Because it keeps governments in check and creates an incentive to not manipulate a currency to an unfair degree. Now they have to compete with Bitcoin. I'll transact in Bitcoin if I can't trust my own governments money.

1 Satoshi is 1USD if btc hits 100 million dollars
But at 1 million, are you gonna buy a drink for 500 satoshis? Maybe I'm just not used to it. 
I mean the value changes quite a lot for me to understand a fair price for a drink in Sats. 
I just think it'll be quite a long time

@_date: 2019-05-02 21:25:37
I get what you mean,
Here's the thing - right now we don't necessarily NEEED it to be a means of immediate exchange for goods/services.
What we NEED is a safe haven from currency controlled by predatory government - that is liquid, traceable, non confiscate-able, mathematically finite, durable (network durability), and permissionless. All these things are done with bitcoin without the need of a 3rd party.
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:23:01
Yeah I hear ya
Hard not to take profits but... Yeah just HODL. Why swing trade? You got people who are gaming this system hard because it's in its infancy - I don't think I can out perform them but I know I can be patient. 
Bitcoin is no joke - what it is is unprecedented and unstoppable. The world needs it.
Btc is email for money. 
There will be layers and layers of protocols on top of it to include smart contracts, domains, DNS, filters, firewalls, etc. 
I like ethereum, cardano etc. But why do they need a coin? Just be a decentralized system that sends bitcoin. You're not gonna overthrow bitcoin. We have the protocol - use it. 
Everyone's trying to find the next "bitcoin". Bitcoin is the next bitcoin.

Guys, sideways sounds like an awesome thing right now. I honestly hope we sustain. 
All of my friends are afraid of bitcoins volatility. It looks to me like we have massive sellers, followed by massive buyers (I don't know shit about TA tho)
But we're actually staying at 8g. Which is crazy given only months ago it was half that. I anticipate some pullback but the fact that we've seen pullbacks already that were eaten right up is insanely bullish to me. 
I really do think big money is starting to see the big picture. Were seeing actual financial institutions offer btc holdings, I think that majorly substantiated bitcoin as a real world investment and not some weird nerd money.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:59:32
This is what Chico crypto was saying
Basically since found out they had fractional reserves, they probably just went balls out and moved some more of those reserves into btc, pumped the fuck out of it and just sold it. 
I mean I have no clue but I wouldn't be surprised. 
I don't think it's too bad in the long run. It gave retail some hope that it's not completely dead. I think institutions will see the retail hype and game the fuck out of it. 
Will only substantiate btc even further as a means of exchange. 
I'll mow your lawn for a few sats
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:23:21
Yeah, looks like we saw an intense drop followed by an intense rise moments later.

Honestly hope so. Waiting on a financial move from Wells Fargo.. Guess what - They sent the check to the wrong address. Should've had it right when we saw the tether FUD, but nah, whoopsie daisy. Oh and then I have to wait for the check to clear from my bank before it's liquid. Superb. 
Bitcoin is a no duh at this point yo. At the very worst I see the government finally biting the bullet and coming out with their own stablecoin, same way they had to embrace email.
Don't let anyone tell you bitcoin is a fad. They're absolutely ignorant to the pending disruption.

Hey guys,
Checking in, any reason for this pump in particular? Do we see new money coming in or are people just pulling from alts to get into the more stable bitcoin?
Just wondering what you TA guys are looking at - my theory is that tether is scary right now and binance does not allow withdrawal, so we're seeing everyone move money into something stable. 
I'm probably insanely ignorant but whatever, let's get the chat buzzing
@_date: 2019-05-17 05:05:26
I mean... Study up man
You can say the same thing about gold... It's like... Whatever people think it's worth. 
Like nobody goes oh wow look how [conductive] this brick of gold is it must be worth $80,000.
At least with Bitcoin, we know for a fact it's finite. We know it's network is secure and redundant. We know we can send it instantly to anyone in the world, anonymously and quickly. And we know that a Bitcoin is a Bitcoin through math. And you earn Bitcoin by keeping track of the network. The miners are rewarded for keeping the ledger in tact. So you get this weird string of numbers that verifies to anyone and everyone that you own a piece of the network. The one that supports all the features above. 
If I want to [sell apples] in exchange for bitcoin instead of USD, who is stopping me? Because sometimes the thing that stops you is the bank. Now they can't. 
So like, yeah it's volatile but like... It's important. It really is like internet gold. The larger the market cap, the less subject it is too volatility.

Starting to hear my friends express interest again, leading to legitimate conversations about btc's future. 
After the 20k dump you couldn't mention bitcoin without everyone just dismissing the subject. 
Pretty bullish to me. I think institutions will pump back to 20k, then the retail hype will blast us into 50k territory.
