"of the Bitcoin Foundation" meaning they both officially work for the foundation, like you say above Elizabeth is board member voted by her peers in the foundation so it applies to refer to her as "of the Bitcoin Foundation".
Juan Llanos is member of the "Regulatory Affairs Committee" of the Bitcoin Foundation so it is also applicable to refer to him as "of the Bitcoin Foundation".
I agree regular members who support the foundation, but have no active responsibility shouldn't be refered to as "of the Bitcoin Foundation", but in this case they both work and have responsibility when they talk on behalf of the Foundation.
In this interview they both expressed their personal opinions though which I find was interesting because they don't necessarily agree on all the issues!

This is the best news for Bitcoin in terms of legal validation and validation as an asset with value. 
The US government is turning itself into a user of Bitcoin as it sells it. 
It is the final confirmation that Bitcoin is legal in the sense that the government wouldn't sell cocaine to the open market to incriminate itself. Nor would it sell Bitcoin if it would be illegal or thinking of making it illegal.
As a user it is acting just like any other market participant and selling it, I suppose, through normal channels like a exchange or in the OTC market (directly to whoever wants to give them dollars for their Bitcoins).
In my mind this validates ALL links in the bitcoin value chain:
1. The block chain because it is "physically" where the transfers will be executed, 
2. the Bitcoin client software or whatever wallet they have them in because the government is using it to store, and send the Bitcoins, 
3. the exchange into fiat money because it is receiving dollars for Bitcoins, 
4. the validity as a value reserve because it is extracting stored value from this stock held by it, and finally 
5. as suitable for the public because instead of retiring the Bitcoin they hold they are promoting it by re-entering into circulation.
&lt;strong&gt;Again this is the most important validation of Bitcoin of the biggest country in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;

This would be a great way of bypassing the AML and Money Transmitting regulations that so many Bitcoin companies have trouble with: using banks in the US and EU to issue the cards and connect to the CC networks.
My only concern would be that there is another layer of cost to the end user and merchant: bank + card network + Xapo + Bitstamp to trade the BTC.
Aside from the above this is brilliant for consumers and Bitcoin.

Incredibly cavalier article on FT.com!
I agree central banks should replace their old fashioned currencies with e-money, but to say Bitcoin has served to deflect real asset bubbles with only a 10 billion market cap is simple not true.
The dollar running on a "dollar block chain" managed by the Fed instead of a ledger managed by the commercial banks would be brilliant and reduce frictional costs just like Bitcoin is doing it.
This also would finally dis-intermediate the banks since the "value" is held on the dollar block chain instead of the banks.

I think there are 3 scenarios for what happened to the money:
1- I am so stupid I didn't realize for years that I was being robed, I didn't check my accounts, I didn't reconcile with client's funds, my operation was a total mess.
2- I used the funds deposited in my client's accounts to trade and speculate for Gox account, I did investments and went sour, and I lent the money to other people who didn't pay me back. I invested the funds like a bank and lost them.
3- I stole the money, it's in secret addresses that nobody can trace because because I used mixers. I will disappear soon. Sayounara!
My speculation is that Gox was a very badly managed operation and it is possible they got hacked an some coins were stolen, but, like many financial institutions have done before, I think they invested badly and lost money and didn't know how to tell the world. 
Also, it is possible that after considering and realizing that they were fucked anyway, they decided to steal the rest!

To satisfy the need of money meaning more units of the currency need to be created for trade. If you keep the creation of units stuck at a low rate then the economy will first revalue that currency and then replace it (at least partially) to satisfy the flow of trade. If the adoption of Bitcoin increases it will not be used for trade, only fo investment (like gold).
It is not practical to price your goods (say bicycles) at 10 Bitcoins if you need to lower the price every day because Bitcoin is going up.
It is better to use dollars that maintain the value for a while at least and you can expect to interchange it more easily that if it was losing or gaining value at a fast rate.

1- Good then that it is possible to have a Bitcoin financial system where new Bitcoins are created by lending, it's only that it is young yet.
2- In theory it is infinite, in practice you say the public regulates some level of reserves to protect their deposits, in this case then the Bitcoin supply could be multiplied several times.

I agree storing your bitcoins at Coinbase is like having them in a bank or at PayPal, but I think it still provides all the other advantages of the bitcoin system and mainstream users are not really concerned with institutions holding their assets. It's more about the upside opportunity they seek and low costs of bitcoin rather than replacement of the third party.
@_date: 2013-09-01 15:28:28
Some concepts I read on this discussion:
1. It is possible to lend Bitcoins.
2. Then it is possible to create Bitcoins through lending.
3. The creation of new Bitcoins through lending would be limited because clients would require a reserve to deposit the money.
4. This is easy to check because the ledger and balances per public key are visible.
Am I correct?
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:21:32
I would write much more positive about Bitcoin, but I am afraid authorities will come to arrest me for promoting it so much without a license (even if I am just a blogger!).

@_date: 2013-11-01 22:42:53
It shouldn't be regulated, but with more than 2 billion in value and likely rising the question is legitimate,  the money is in the block chain and regulators control where the money is as well as the service providers.

The question is, which is the better network? Ripple or Bitcoin? It seems Ripple goes against many of the Bitcoin ideals.
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:54:23
Many factors in favor of a short term burst in price:
1) US Fed maintains monthly printing of $85 billion.
2) Economy capacity of storing value in the dollar is saturating, many moving to even more risky assets like junk bonds, emerging market stocks, alternative investments, farms, low quality real estate, etc.
3) SilkRoad closed generates a "now Bitcoin is clean" sensation an many new investors will adopt it. New startups, more merchants, and thus more demand.
4) This chart (link to CoinDesk) signals the same highs, but higer lows in the last few weeks of Bitcoin trading, this is a signal investors are picking up Bitcoins at higher prices and will buy in a frenzy when it finally doesn't go down in the near future.
5) SilRoad also creates a "if there was so much buy and selling using Bitcoin it means it works as a currency" idea that will increase adoption too.
6) Now even newspapers in emerging markets are propagating the news that Bitcoin is the new currency without a central bank (news today in my country Argentina on the biggest newspaper Clarin)

@_date: 2013-12-01 07:10:47
1. Litecoin is identical, but multiplied by 4 (84 million by 2140) this means Bitcoin plus Litecoin is a real supply of 105.000.000 Bitcoin/Litecoins this is the real stock not 21 million.
2. Ripple is 100 billion more, but worse because they are already mined so they are readily available.
3. Recent new multi-millionaires will panic with even a small correction triggering a huge sell-off that will feed itself into yet another bubble burst.
4. The real Bitcoin economy is non-existent because miners, merchants, and individuals only wanted to hoard and not really conduct commerce.
5. The main motive for Bitcoin and other alt-coins is speculation not freedom. Freedom is just a moral justification, but what we all want is be millionaires, freedom is a derivative of that!
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:58:26
Of course certainty is a personal appreciation, but if you observe the history of Bitcoin, its intelligent design, robust technology, recent price  evolution, wallet adoption, merchant adoption, impact in the media, talk by central bankers and politicians, official government guidelines to operate legally, investor interest directly and through start-ups, I would say YOU are extremely idiot if you don't appreciate the general trend!

1. It doesn't have an order book, they have the info from their order flow of course, but its shown on 3rd party sites, there is no page on Mt.Gox where this info is easily accessible. On Bitstamp its readily available and easy to find and use.
2. How the API works is technical information and useless from the retail investor point of view. If Bitstamp is enabling order entry in an unfair way for users this is an accusation you need to prove before, though I think is higly unlikely because my experience entering orders has been perfect and my observation of order execution seems perfect too. I haven't read any accusation to this point anywhere except yours here.

The "black market of the black market": redlisted coins would be worth less than regular coins and a new business of "Bitcoin Laundering" would be created (the exchange of redlisted coins vs regular coins).This will create another layer of criminal activities and yet another system to control it.
It seems the current tracking ability of all bitcoins on the block chain should be enough to track, detect wallets and coins. Anything further would increase the layers of control and so on.

I think volatility will continue and there will be more peaks and dips.
@_date: 2013-09-01 18:21:49
This is a key of the Bitcoin system, it is so easy to store and handle directly on the Bitcoin network that it would seem of less quality to deposit it at an institution, there is not value added as with gold or bills and coins that are a hassle and insecure and depositing it in a bank seems more convenient.
The interest compensation could be an incentive.

Bitcoin is not a mature asset class to use it for your retirement plan as the only investment, but it is certainly attractive to include in a diversified portfolio. If $250 is money you can spare for a risky, but very attractive long term investment then I do recommend it because ot is the perfect vehicle to protect the value of your money (deflationary).
The service that provides a recurring saving mechanism for Bitcoin is Coinbase, they have a recurring payment button where you can set $250 weekly and they debit it automaticaly and buy Bitcoins n your Coinbase wallet.
They will include Litecoin and other cryptocurriencies in the future so will be able to diversify, but for now ithink you are safe with Bitcoin only since they will be trading similarly for the time being.
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:03:51
I agree there might not be much of a correction this time, that's why I think we need to hold for now.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:43:13
I really don't know that's why I would hold to what I have now and if it goes to 180-200 then I would buy all I can.
I Have 2 options at this point:
1) Sell and speculate to buy lower.
2) Hold on and only buy more IF it goes lower.
I recommend 2.

It has network effects, but at the same time it is an open architecture and open source and it is easy to switch from BTC to LTC to Ripple so there is not much lock-in. The network effect seems to be shared by all crypto-currencies, but it doesn't benefit BTC alone because there are no barriers to move from alt-coin to alt-coin. Exchanges that trade multiple currencies serve as gateways to enable this. Wallets like Coinkite also enable this for storage and send and receive services.
I think that this last rally showed how all digital currencies are fungible and equally useful so i think eventually LTC and Ripple will debase BTC because they are better as currencies (LTC confirms every 2.5 minutes and Ripple confirms instantly and supports all currencies n the world).
I would even go as far as to say that Ripple will in turn, debase LTC and Ripple will be the winner. Also the dollar and other fiat will stay functional because governments will force them as legal tender.

You should build an anonymous messaging system in the wallet so we can communicate about these issues with the company customer service and ourselves as users to chat about the market and pass info when we transact between each other. It would be like a whatsup for the wallet!

Haha!  I thought I was the only one not answering the questions correctly about his own life! I had to wait 24 hs for a second chance. Yes they use some service like credit bureau, equifax, or something that verifies adjusted to Patriot Act, 1933 Securities Act, and banking regulations... This kind of verification procedure is standard for financial institutions and it suck because it was created by the government and implemented by traditional banks.

Thank you  I understand Bitcoins are the only ones created by mining and the stock is the one in the ledger. 
I guess "bank money" would be Bitcoin IOUs and not real Bitcoins.
In fiat money you have bills and coins, reserve balances at the central bank, and bank money created by commercial banks.
These last are IOUs too, but treated and accepted just like base money. I wonder how this will play in the Bitcoin system if they are circulated through Bitcoin financial services (lending and deposits).

Of course and also pay attention to this recommendation if you want! But I think this is the correct strategy.

The basic functionality needed is a place to store, send, and receive bitcoins, but after that the question everybody asks is : Where do I buy and sell them?

Everything that is detailed in the bill of rights is legal, but the government acts as if we are all guilty until proven innocent.
This happens with immigration (a foreigner in a US airport is a suspect of illegal entry by default).
I think we have to follow the crowd so Bitcoin becomes fully accepted.

1) I agree.
2) Ripple is not a scam, but it is annoying that they kept 60 billion for themselves!
3) I agree, but with this huge run 10,000 bitcoin is 10 millon dollars! And before it was nothing. New sudden multi-millionaires will want to cash out and enjoy the riches.
4) Many merchants are using Bitcoin, but I think it is to hoard not really as a commerce tool. LTC and Ripple will have this soon, I don't see the "network effect" on BTC.
5) I Agree!

I listed 13 pairs in the article, I didn't realize they are filtered by state. Can you post the complete list here so I add it to the article?
