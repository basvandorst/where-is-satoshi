hmm, can you please explain why EOS? 
I would not dare to invest such an amount in a project without a product and no mainnet. 
All the bugs that are maybe somewhere under the hood, the risk of a total failure. 
At this stage the risk reward is just to low with a valuation of 1/5 ETH ( market cap ) 
in my point of view I would equal weight BTC and ETH (like I did) , or better wait till the ratio drop down to 0,03 again to get them cheap.
For example I am struggling  since 8months if I should sell 5-10BTC for some ADA ( at least they have a mainnet but also have no „final“ product )

this behavior is called: HYPE / GREED
maybe you find yourself here:

important privacy: 
 tweeted today, that the bitcoin.com wallet users generated the 2,5mio wallet, the questions is where do they get the number from without sending userdata back to the bitcoincom servers: 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:09:00

@_date: 2017-05-21 09:39:17

how high the percentage has to go, to activate it through the UASF? Are there any time targets?
Thinkin about to running a node

an ETF isnt possible now - and cannot be accept by the SEC. Because the fund of the ETF cannot be insured, as it is Possible with Fiat or stocks. 
If your credit card gets stolen and some of your money will be robbed, you will get back everything because it is insured. With Bitcoin this isnt possible now, so as Long as there are any possibility to steal any sort of coins they cannot accept it. 
Hoe can the fund/etf garantue that they didnt get hacked. Where shoold they store there value in paper wallet yes they can bit they need liquidity at the market so there would be at least a value of 10-20% which will be at risk on online trade wallets.
But I am on your site, I think there will be a day where this gonna happen

complet nonsens article. what give someone the right to blame a company not supporting his choice.  If he doesn't like it just move to another service. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:09:13
what a shity articel. -sorry. 
But how could you think about something.
- One mans trash is another mans treasure. 
If the "Frexit" happen you can close the EU and Euro, and in addition to this, the stock market will crash and bitcoin will be worth nothing. 
We dont know how the market will act in a financial crises like 2008 but I dont think anyone will have the money for bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:51:01
i dont get it. Is it already done through the UASF, is segwit actually happen (is it fixed or can it failed) in august? If yes, who decided that? Didnt we need any certain level of UASF signalin nodes.
Thanks

to track your portfolio you can use the app from shapeshift (coincap) it also drwas a chart for your portfolio. Simply add your coin to a portfolio and enter the value you have - thats all.
Edit: withdraw your coins from the exchange and store it in a paperwallet if you planing to hold it.

Did you live in the US. ?
Because such a Information only can be from the Media. The reality is just opposite. 
We cooperate well with russia but we have to treat the US as well as possible so we do follow some rules like a trading stop with russia, but we all are in favor in both directions.
In addition our military cooperate with each other.
The only thing we didnt want are these US stations with rockets pointing to Russia and the US moved there defense Lines very close to Russia in the last years. So they forced a conflict but there is no reason because we need each other and only want to live in peace.

Argentina Debt to GDB is 58%(2017) 
Japan Debt to GDB is 253%(2017) 
according to this Argentina should be fine. 
So the number itself didnt matter at all, its just to scare and influence / push you in a specific mindset.

Ripple is a coin for banks and they are really using it they trading it with a small amount of "risk money". 
A friend work for a  european Bank he said that to me. A few months ago I exchanged a small amount of BTCs into Ripple just to stay diversified. You get a few 1000s of it out of a few bucks and maybe some day it would be worth more then now.

if the santa then sends more then 1BTC, we know he’s bad in risk/reward.
