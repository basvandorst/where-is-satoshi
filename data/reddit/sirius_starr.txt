Tether is, in theory, a cryptocurrency backed by the USD (mostly, I think they have euros and soon yen also, but USD is what it's primarily used for).  As in, each Tether (USDT) in existence is backed by a US dollar in fiat sitting in the issuers account somewhere and can be redeemed as such.  Basically, instead of each US dollar being redeemable for a fixed amount of gold (as it was under the gold standard), each Tether is redeemable for a fixed amount of fiat.
The upside is that it has very low volatility relative to fiat, with USDT trading pretty much constantly between $0.98 and $1.02.  Other upside is it lets you "cash out" other cryptocurrencies on an exchange to fiat without actually cashing out to fiat.
Downsides are pretty damn obvious.  There is basically zero reason to believe that the issuing company actually HAS the fiat reserves the claim to, there's been some sketchy stuff where they claimed they were audited but had zero transparency about it, other sketchy stuff where they issued massive quantities of new Tether without really any announcement of bringing in new capital, and most recently their relationship with their auditor has fallen apart.
Up to you whether or not you think it's a scam or a useful halfway point as we (hopefully) move from fiat to crypto.  Or a scam that happens to be useful.
Edit:  FAQs are [here]( if you care to read them.

As others have said, difficulty adjustment happened, bch pump happened, then without prior announcement bch trading opened on Coinbase, where prices rapidly skyrocketed to ridiculously inflated levels (like 8-9k, well over double any other exchange).  It reeks of insider trading, and this comes on top of their continued refusal to implement Segwit, because it's "not a priority" (but pumping an altcoin was).

Already done.  Never conducting business with them again after this shitshow.

I personally found this white paper on the topic interesting (pertinent to your question, it describes some attacks specific to PoS):

Because nothing says "well thought out solution" like EDA.

Is this that Bitcoin Gold fork I keep hearing about?

I'm still HODLing Taiwan after the 1949 hard fork.  With the lack of replay protection, I didn't want to risk cashing in my PRC.
