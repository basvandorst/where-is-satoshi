Just wondering, why not cavirtex?  It seems like a solid exchange for us Canadians.

That's pretty amazing, but a bit hard to believe :O  How did you get all the money out? Mt Gox has a $1000/day withdrawal limit.

I'm in Vancouver as well, and yeah, a lot of us Vancouverites are interested in Bitcoin.
I sold a few coins a few weeks back to someone in person at a cafe downtown.
Nanaimo Gold, like datathe1st, is _really_ slow in getting back to you.  My first few bitcoin came from Nanaimo Gold.

By easiest, I mean with the lowest fees.  My bank (TD) charges only $1.5 for any interac email transfer.

I'm far from a libertarian, but I would really like Bitcoin to take off.

There are many of us waiting for this, so it will just drive itself right back up (if it indeed pops).
