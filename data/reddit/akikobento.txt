I mean if a comm gov organises systematically with a monopoly scale, thats the real winter for other miners. will be a lot more worse. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:08:28
That's not a recommendation.  Investors are financial responsible adults.

What if mining ops become state owned ? Remember China is a socialist country ��������

HODL is the key 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:20:02
so mine more before the winter is.coming 
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:29:25
Who would set up a mining ops if the mining ROI is 3-5 years. This long time ROI could happen if chn gov comes in

Guys, if all of the above are true, BTC price will drop below 2k usd.for a while
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:02:12
Okay got your point ! I prefer John keep his dick 
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:47:28
Seriously 1 Mil per BTC ? Has anyone calculated with the whole market cap by then? Reasonable ?
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:34:01
I’m impressed. Thank you

I sold my stocks last weeks and bought BTC and miners. Not yet sold one of my apartments thought is about too rigid for now- may be a viable option later - but difinitely sell stocks and invest in BTC. 
I'm in SH, China

Good point. No VAT tax through from end to end - miner machines, BTC sells, relevant services etc. plus price is cheap from IT ops, mining hosting, electricity cost. It's a thriving biz now under the radar
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:34:46
Faith kept

I just bought a bunch of BTC at 18000RMB ( 2800USD) . I will lock my investment and see it in 5 years 
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:13:47
If you look back in 3 years or 5 years time, and ask the same quantitive basis question, you might not get a satisfying answer. However, if you look at the record of growth rate for BTC, 500% rate is really not a surprising number
