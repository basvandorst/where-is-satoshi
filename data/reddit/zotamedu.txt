I was wondering since one of their selling points is that they are using 100 % renewable energy. They even have a hydroelectric dam as a backdrop on their site but nowhere do they explain how they can guarantee that they are getting 100 % renewable. The WECC fuel mix is 50 % fossil and about 10 % nuclear. So unless they are part of a guarantee of origin scheme or they are buying RECs or they have their own personal dam that is not part of the rest of the WECC grid, they are in fact using only 40 % renewable. That's how the electrical power grid works. So I was kind of curious which of them it was.

You got it all backwards with that analogy. HTML is one of the cornerstones in what builds the modern day internet, or rather the world wide web as the internet is much larger. HTML is a small piece of the puzzle that makes the internet and the internet was around before HTML was first made. It's hard to define when the internet was invented, some place it in the late 60's when ARPANET was built and others say early 80's when TCP/IP was introduced and the many large networks around the world were combined into one. HTML and the world wide web came in the early 90's. So you got your analogy backwards. It's more like: "this internet thing is great but I don't think HTML 1.1 is going to survive in the long run".

That is actually not true and it's an old missconception. The greeks proved the earth was round and calculated it's size. So we've known earth to be a sphere for about 2500 years. Before that, it wasn't really science that ruled but religion. So there's really neer been any time where a flat earth has been mainstream science.

The tricky part is now to try to figure out who is the puppet and who is the puppeteer. So Buttcoin is owned by some entity that is out to destroy Bitcoin. Then it was sold to Butterflylabs. So does that mean that Butterflylabs took over all the shills? So Butterflylabs is also just a front for the same mysterious entity that wants to ruin Bitcoins? Or did the Buttcoin agents go rogue/double agent and started shilling for BLF instead? Maybe they are just smart enough to take money from both sides and laugh at the stupidity of it all? There's too many sockpuppets with too many hands up their butts. Who owns the hands and which butts are they up?

Total hashing rate has stagnated and even decreased in the last month. I see no driving force behind an exponential growth unless the price increases and then there's still the problem of the mining bonus halving. The margins seems to be very slim now so any large investment now has a long ROI so it seems like they need to start factoring that in now. It all hinges on the bitcoin price. As long as it remains stagnant, there's no real incentive to exponentially increase hashing power. The value of those 25 coins they get needs to exceed the value of the electricity they use. It seems like the miners fee on transactions will soon need to increase.
A rough estimate is that each transaction cost 10-25 USD in electricity. That's based on an estimated total power consumption of 250 MW for the total network. Currently, those 10-25 dollars are not paid by the ones doing the transaction but by the ones buying the newly mined coins. 
So everything depends on the price of a bitcoin.

Bitcoin is one implementation of blockchain technology. It is in no way needed for the underlying technology to work. As shown by a couple of hundred alt coins that have spun off and evolved the basic concept. But I agree, comparing Bitcoin to the internet is a bad analogy for many reasons. I just felt that this person made a particularly bad analogy that showed no understanding for neither Bitcoin nor the internet. Bitcoin is nothing like the internet and it would be nice if people stopped making silly and widely inaccurate analogies. 
Also, I never claimed that the reverse of an analogy is always true, I said that in this example, the reverse makes a bit more sense. It's still not a good or even relevant analogy but the one I replied to was so utterly wrong it's embarrassing. There's apparently 6 people here that have no idea what the internet is.

That's 6 billion that will take a over 100 years to mine out. In 2016, the block reward will half to 12.5 BTC per block which means that the price or the efficiency needs to double until then. As for investments, ASICs have ran into the wall of Moore's law just as the rest of the semiconductor industry. Previously, they could make insane increases in efficiency by jumping to newer and newer nodes but now they have reached the best that's available. Next generation is set to either use the new 20 nm half node and some will stay on 28 nm. So they are stuck at mainly architectural improvements for now. It is unclear when a 16 nm FinFET node will be available for high powered chips. 20 nm low power is slowly starting to roll out.

That's still not how the power grid works. Not even remotely. To be guaranteed to use energy from hydro you need to build a hydro plant of your own that is not connected to the grid. Certain energy markets allow for what called a guarantee of origin which in a way would could give you hydro. Not that it's very relevant since that's more expensive than the spot market. Not that a mining farm is likely to use the spot market. They are at the mercy of the local distributor and the deals they have. 
Anyway, that's all rather irrelevant since what you actually use is still either a mean fuel mix or a marginal fuel mix. Personally, I prefer to classify it as marginal consumption which is basically never ever hydro. 
Why this fixation with hydro?

No you were not simply dumbing it down, you were giving completely and utterly false information. You claimed that OpenCL was for AMD and DirectX was for Nvidia and that Mantle was to replace them both. That's what you wrote and all of it is wrong. Not just a simplification but completely wrong. A simplification would be that Mantle is a better version of OpenGL and DirectX (technically Direct3D).
I find it kind of sad that people have grown so lazy that they cannot read more than three rows of text without a TL;DR. No wonder you do not know the difference between different graphics frameworks since that would take you reading more than a tweets worth of text. Oh well, for your benefit.

"This innovation is more substantial than the internet. The blockchain is going to have an even larger impact. As to what currency does it -- that's difficult to say."
What a load of BS. If they want to do all that, the blockchain requires the internet to work. Bitcoins would be impossible without the internet. The entire concept of distributing mining require a distributed network. So no, blockchain is not greater than the internet. Blockchain exists because of the internet.

@_date: 2014-02-02 17:50:58
Not a single word was correct there. OpenCL is a framework for writing programs that can run on many different platforms. It's useful to make use of the extreme parallel computation performance of a grahpics card for more general workloads than just 3D graphics. DirectX is a graphics API that both AMD, Nvidia and Intel supports. If that wasn't the case, most PC games would not run on AMD since most games use DirectX. I think you confuse it with OpenGL which is a open source graphics API designed to compete with DirectX which is closed and owned by Microsoft. But all platforms, including mobile phones and tablets support OpenGL. The ones that are closed are CUDA for Nivida which is a special API for genereal purpose calculations, so it's a closed version of OpenCL. Then there's this new Mantle from AMD which is a low lever graphics API which is designed to compete with DirectX. 
Note the difference here. Mantle, OpenGL and DirectX are all used for graphics and not general calcualtions. It is highly unlikely that Mantle can effectively be used for mining software since it's not what it's designed to do. Furthermore, the main advantage is the reduced CPU overhead for draw calls which is not a problem for mining anyway.

And in 5 years the hashing power of a Jackson will be utterly pointless. The total hashing power has increased by a factor of 10 in the last two years and a factor of 100 000 in the last four. So then the economic incentive to run them will be nill. So then you need to ask yourself, do you want a noisy miner that only cost you money or do you want a quiet space heater that will only cost you money? 
You really do not want to design a system where you rely on direct electric heating to any large extent. 
BTW, this is about the same argument that the proponent of incandescent lights tried to make. Same with anyone trying to defend low efficiency technology with the argument that you can use the waste heat. It's almost never true. You can find some very specific scenarios where it might make sense but as a general rule, it's a bad idea.

I don't think you understand the different time scopes we are working with here. As bitcoin was first rolled out, the current largest CSP plant which I mentioned above was already in the later stages of the design. They started building it in 2010. The nuclear power plants with the new and suposedly cheap EPR design started construction, not planning, in 2005 (Finland), 2007 (France) and 2009 (China). None of them are actually completed yet. They were planned to take between 4 and 5 years but have been plagued by delays. So the total lifetime of bitcoin is the time it take to build a nuclear power plant. The planning for the one in Finland started in 15 years ago. 
The main source of solar power is PV cells and they have expected to get cheaper and cheaper. It's quite simple to estimate the future price since they are based on known technology. It's just anther semi-conductor. 
You don't seem to understand how money works... New money is always being made because they have a finite lifespan. The US has a budget of about 700 million for 2015 to produce and handle the money supply. Dollar bills cost between 5 and 10 cents each to print. Note that the 700 million is to sustain a M0 money supply of 40 000 million USD. So the cost of holding the money supply is about 2 % of the "market cap". If we do the same for bitcoin we end up with a yearly electricity bill of around 7 % of total market cap. Printing money as is keeping up with inflation is generally not a matter of actually printing money. Most of the money is already digital in some way. There's also no reason why larger notes are more expensive. You could do a factor ten inflation and the cost of printing money would be the same or even less because you could stop using the smallest coins. You would just print less 10 dollar bills and more 100 dollar bills and the cost for that is the same. You are effectively just adding a zero to the bank notes, you are not printing 10 times as many notes. Interestingly enough, the yearly bitcoin electricity price is about half of the money printing budget even though all the dollars are worth 10 times more. So much for efficiency.


Yes why are people trying to use a system that is inferior to the well established and well tested system? Many people are asking that question. It seems to be a matter of either people wanting to get rich quick or people doing it for political (libertarian) reasons. Not because it's actually in any way more practical or efficient in any way. 


Hopefully not. A lot of money is being spent on alternative energy but bitcoin has exactly zero effect on that. It's not in any way relevant in the global energy problems. It's not a solution and there's not enough money in it to make any meaningful investments. Currently, bitcoin is actually doing more harm to the environment since it's a huge waste of energy. You burn about 1 million dollars worth of electricity per day to move around 50 million dollars of transactions. Compare that to about 2 billion being withdrawn form ATMs each day. Yes Americans withdraw about 40 times the amount of cash from ATMs each day as the total global bitcoin transactions are worth. 
Going back to energy, a lot of stuff is being done and there are loads of promising technologies. So it will sort itself out sooner or later. Some of the main problems are not really technical. It will take some work to get people to change their life styles. Parts of America will have to get used to the idea of not driving everywhere at all time. Most major cities around the world has learned that cars are a horrible idea and that the only way to build a reasonably sized city is to base it around a public transport system. Los Angeles is a nice example on why cars really do not work at a large scale. Other consumption patterns need to change as well. So there's some large things and countless of small things that needs to change. But it will sort itself out. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:43:07
Not nearly enough money in bitcoin to fuel any noticeable increase in green energy development. The total bitcoin market cap is not even enough to buy one new nuclear power plant. The current market cap is at about 4 billion USD. If you want some more comparisons, the new concentrated solar power plant in California cost 2.2 billion USD and it does not produce enough energy to power the bitcoin network. It's been estimated that about 250 billion USD was invested globaly in renewable energy in 2013. So even if we sold all bitcoins in existance at market price and added all last years VC money, it would barely be noticeable in the grand scheme of things.

Or they'll accept it and then send it to the bitcoineater. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:44:03
After about 14 months it starts costing money. As I said, I did include the cost of the mined bitcoins with very generous parameters and it still ends up costing you more. The cost of buying it is so much higher that you will most likely never get that money back. The Jackson, which is a very cheap unit, will be more expensive even in the long run. 
But of course it's hard to project. The major assumption in the economic calcualtion was a constant price of bitcoin. But then it does not account for a new generation of miners that will probably come out and drastically increase the hashing power. The othe rhuge part is that the economic calculations assumed it would be running 24/7 which is of course not true. So the makes the miner much worse.
Anyway, if you can't make a profit from a miner when using it as a miner, then using it as a space heater will not make you any money either. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:08:37
Depends on how much money you are willing to pay for a space heater. I did a quick check on Amazon and the first couple of hits were of 1500 W units that cost about $30. Some more expensive and some cheaper depending on functionality and design. Then we can have a look at a miner. Spondoolies has a SP20 Jackson on sale for $595 with a rated power of 1200 W. So that's 20 times the cost for slightly less power. Seems like a bad deal. 
So what if we try to account for the fact that you might find a block or two with it? I entered the numbers into bitcoinwisdom's mining calulator. I was generous and did not include a pool fee and a low difficulty increase of 2 % instead of the standard 20 %. No cost for set up or maintenance either. Just electricity and the cost to buy. Based on that, you'll get about $50 in the first couple of months and after little over a year, you'll be losing money. Total return flattened out at -145 dollar so in the end, you paid about 4 times as much for the same thing. 
So based on the actual cost of an ASIC miner, there is a very good reason to buy a regular space heater. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:45:34
It's about as simple as calculating the electricity cost. Both includes some assumptions but the order of magnitude should be right. There are no real great big unknowns in either case. It's also a highly significant cost as it turns out since it's roughly as large as the electricity cost.
The rest gets a bit hard. The cost of housing would be quite a pain to calculate since it can vary so much but considering the buildings we've seen pictures of, it should be quite a bit lower than mining hardware. We've seen reused old factories and cheap storage facilities, often out on the country side. There's also a residual value there since the old factory should be worth pretty much the same if you stopped mining and sold it to some other business. The cost of cooling and other systems might also be interesting. I doubt it would make a major difference but some uses rather large cooling systems that's more complicated than large fans. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:25:15
You forgot a very important cost and that is the cost of hardware. If we use the same S4 at a cost of $1150 for 2 TH/s and a total network hashrate ot 300 000 TH/s, then we get a total investment cost of 172.5 million dollars that needs to be recovered. If we assume a ROI of two years which seems somewhat reasonable considering hardware development, then you need another $240 000 per day to cover the hardware. That's not using any fancy economic analysis of discounting and net present value. If you want to pay off the miners in one year, then you need to double that value of yours and sell about 70 % of the bitcoins.
Then there's surrounding systems such as cooling and utilities and you need to pay rent and other dull things.

Here's the original artist. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:59:18
Depends on the resolution you want. If we just launch the laser into space, we can get rid of a lot of disturbance and then we only have the diffraction and beam divergence to worry about. You should be able to get a spot that is tens of meters in diameter. With a powerful enough laser, you could do some burning that way but it will be very large letters. The problem is building a powerful enough laser because of the low energy flux. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 08:37:03
The key word is still **resolution**. With laser that is tens of meters wide, you would write letters that are in the order of 100 by 100 meters. That's around the resolving power of the Hubble space telescope. Luckily, we don't actually need Hubble to survey the moon's surface. We have the LRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) that has a resolution of 0.5 meters per pixel. 
The delay for light travelling to the moon and back is not a problem. That's only 1.3 seconds or 2.6 seconds of round trip latency. That's negectable with a block confirmation time of 10 minutes (600 seconds). 
The last part, you hit the nail on the head. It is utterly pointless and a massive waste of time, money and energy. It would serve no practical application at all except for someone's deranged fantasies. There's been talks about sending up small satellites in earth orbit containing nodes and even that is a utterly stupid idea thought up by someone who has no real understanding for how the real world works.
