Definitely saw how successful Wendy’s has been with their twitter and wanted a piece of that action

You would have a lot more BTC if you bought in during the lower parts of the dips. I know it’s completely impossible to guess when that will be, but it’s also not ‘irrelevant in the long term.’

That's not true. It still would have been better to buy at a dip. You would have more BTC for your buck.
Just because you're still out ahead doesn't mean it was the 'right' thing to do. Short of the price permanently flattening or a burst, it's actually the worst case scenario.

I don’t think they care about how much it appreciated relative to some arbitrary number, they are asking you a personal question and as a result aren’t satisfied when you give them a less-than-specific answer. Answering with a percentage won’t help you there.
If you don’t want to tell them, then simply say you’d rather keep the answer to yourself. This is akin to asking how to deal with people asking your net worth or yearly income.

Ah so you’re hoping someone here will give you some.

It might increase the demand and therefore the value of your coins no?

I know I said not to invest at your age but maybe it’s not that bad of an idea actually. You most likely don’t have a lot of bill. Anyways work is the only way.

Earn more. Also investing probably isn’t for you yet.
