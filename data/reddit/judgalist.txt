Only a genius knows when a top will be the top or a bottom will stay the bottom.

Google translation:
The bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. He
exists since January 1, 2009 and can be used to pay in
online stores or for other online services.
Bitcoins are not, as normal money, by a central bank
circulation. Instead, all bitcoins that are in circulation are
created by letting computers work on solutions from
selected mathematical problems. That works like this:
Anyone can run special software on his or her computer
contributes to solving such a mathematical problem. The owner
of the computer that finds the solution to a problem
25 (newly created) bitcoins as a reward. Because in 2014 every
10 minutes such a problem was solved, were there in this way
every 25 minutes 25 bitcoins are put into circulation.
On 1 January 2014 there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoins in circulation.
3p 7 Calculate the number of bitcoins in circulation starting from this year
above 18 million as the rate at which bitcoins are in circulation
not be changed.
In reality, the speed with which bitcoins get in circulation
not equal to 25 bitcoins per 10 minutes. This speed is taking
namely. During the first four years, from 1 January 2009 to
January 1, 2013, the reward per solution was 50 bitcoins. The
reward for finding a solution is every four years
halved: from 1 January 2013 to 1 January 2017, the remuneration is per
solution 25 bitcoins, for the next four years 12.5 bitcoins per solution
and so on.
4p 8 From which year calculate the reward for each solution less than one bitcoin
will be.
The total number of bitcoins that can be put into circulation is limited.
This is a consequence of (among other things) the fact that the remuneration per
solution is always halved. The total number of bitcoins that are in
circulation, can be approximated with the formula:
0.25 21 21 0.5 t C  
Here C is the total number of bitcoins in millions and t the time in years with
t  0 on 1 January 2009.
3p 9 Use the reasoning of the formula to determine the
limit value of the total number of bitcoins in circulation In order to regulate the total number of bitcoins in circulation,
only the number of bitcoins per solution is made smaller, but also
the difficulty of mathematical problems is increasing
made. There are more and more people who bring their computers
let it count.
The difficulty of the problems increases exponentially according to the
formula 0.533 3.65 e .t D   
Here D is a measure of the degree of difficulty and the time in months
with t  0 on 1 January 2013. The larger is D, how
harder to solve the problem.
4p 10 Compose the formula of the derivative of D and explain how to handle this
formula can see that the graph of D is increasing.
The formula can be rewritten in such a way that you can use a difficulty level
fill in and calculate the time in months needed to do so
level of difficulty.
4p 11 Rewrite the formula 0.533 3.65 e t D    so that t is expressed in D

I did the same thing for my daughter exactly six years ago. Tomorrow she will turn 6 years, and back then I thought it would take bitcoin about 18 years to reach 20k or 0. But I couldn't sit still during the bull run of 2017 and sold it all. No regret (yet).

I did exactly the same 5 years ago for my daughter who was then 5 weeks old. I intended to give the bitcoin to her when she would turn 18 years. Last year september I decided it would be better to cash and invest elsewhere, since this thing was going way too fast. 18 years is a very, very long time and I would urge you to reevaluate your decision at least once a year.
