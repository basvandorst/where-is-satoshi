The correct English is huge 'number' of people: people are countable.
That aside, these devs need to get to work, or this project is finished.
I'm not going to make any excuses for this.

How did I miss that?  Noted.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:32:28
Is that you Roger Ver?

Really happy with my Trezor.  Pretty intuitive.  And not too tiny.  Just MHO.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:56:07
My sentiments remain the same.  And I generally eat my pomme frites in Belgium with mayonnaise - but if your world revolves around couches or, as I suspect, sitting at your computer in your underpants, I understand how the low horizons of your imagination limit your perception of other people.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:00:14
Well perhaps it needs a simple statement.  
Do you have a philosophical objection to an imperative?  
Is BTC working well - no.  
So stop making excuses for everyone poncing about while it is being slapped around by people of Ver's quality. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:43:40
No.  People will sell XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:45:47
Yes.  In the same way that Walmart Cola is probably just as good as Coca Cola - it is called Brand Inertia - or something like that.
The brand still has to be good tho., and in this respect BTC is functionally weak at the moment - but few doubt the brand, and the trust in it.
I can see little trust in BCH.  Hell - I hold it - but I'm dying to sell it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:02:10
No, that is not good enough.  It is lazy.  
The charts exaggerate change, because they are not proportional, but you simply cannot pretend there isn't a problem.
This entire community needs to grow up and grow some balls and see a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:42:53
Fucked.  Unless you stop being so complacent.
I hate to say this, I've been heavily invested for years.
You are turning into the Elite:Dangerous of the crypto world.
You think you're great - but you are increasingly shit.
Anyway, Happy New Year, and a prosperous one - you f*cking need some luck with that.

Wallet?  
Put a small amount of value in it.  Reset it.  See if you can get it back!
Reset it again.  Hey, see if you can get it back again!
Hey, maybe try a third time!  Can you get it back with the recovery seed?  
What a good idea.
Hey, now you can put your 450,000 dollars into it!
Sorted - this attention to detail and thought is why some people are rich and others aren't
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:05:49
Absolutely no.
They complement each other.  XRP doesn't attempt to co-opt or compete with BTC.
And XRP makes the pretender Shitcoin Cash (AKA Bitcoin Cash) redundant.
Celebrate it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:09:58
Happy New Year, and I hope you had a good Xmas.  But..
Fuck off, that is lazy bollocks you self-serving twat.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:00:49
 I was always a fan of **Shitcoin Wank**, but apparently this domain name is already registered under Ver.  
Pumping starts on Wednesday.
p.s. Don't ever call it *Shitcoin Wank*, as it is actually the true Bitcoin.
p.p.s. ..or call it Shwankcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:32:46
It's not a joke people. 
BTC is doing nothing except sit back and joke about hodling while the price falls and Ver creates a fake version.  
The entire community should grow up and stop being so complacent.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:08:18
Cool.  Good luck mate.
Just be cautious.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:06:28

BTC needs to bloody sort itself out - or Roger Ver's dishonest altcoin will overwhelm you.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:31:36
Monies will come flooding back into BTC from XRP.  
Most of the movement into XRP was some pretty clever speculation, based on the likelihood that Coinbase will pull a fast one and list it shortly.
It will soon collapse after all that excitement.
My one small concern is that some of that money will flow into Shitcoin Cash - the fake BTC, but that is pretty well hard-pegged at 0.20 BTC and below.  I can't see it go much above that.  I'll sell mine if it does.
So I have absolutely no worries at all.
All will be well in the proper cryptomarket by the second week of January.
Edit: just typos.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:44:41
Irrelevant.  Sort out the scaling and stop advertising.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:22:33
Because of the pathetic response of the BTC community, and the pathetic HODL meme, I've bought some BCash to cover myself.  You useless bastards.  If I had the expertise, I would help, but I can't.  I hope BCash fails - but I'm not going to go down with a sinking ship because you lazy bastards can't think of anything else to say but 'HODL' - pathetic.  Edit: added: you useless wankers.
Happy New Year
