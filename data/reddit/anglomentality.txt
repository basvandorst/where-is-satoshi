So who do you think pays for public servants such as teachers, police, and firefighters?  Who pays for the roads?  Who enforces regulations and laws?  You think is taxes disappears those things just continue to exist magically?

You need a license to homeschool and most people can't afford private school, nor should they have to.  And if they end up surviving on government subsidy money, what was the point of eliminating public schools?  It's redundant. 
 You also seem to think that everyone has a right to use private institutions, which is wrong.


Who's paying for this "private" security?  The private security fairy?  Or do you honestly think it would be a societal benefit to have thugs on corporate payrolls instead of public payrolls?  What interest does Goldman Sachs have in providing security for low-income neighborhoods...?  Your idea is so full of huge gaping holes.  Police also save people from murderers.  The fact that authority is abused doesn't mean our society would fare without police.  It wouldn't.


How about you create the platform which does that?


How is that different than the current real estate tax system in most States?  Sounds identical to me.  Only difference is you want blockchain to verify payments instead of banks and the IRS for some unexplained reason, which is fine, but it doesn't really change how the system works fundamentally.


Yeah we don't need an EPA, our environment is fine.  None of the nations that our doing well utilize regulations effectively.  /s
Any other childishly naive notions you want me to address?

"Life is suffering" is a depressed immature nihilist's view of the world.  Life contains suffering, and you're going to experience it at some time, but to claim that life is equal to suffering is frankly moronic and using that mantra will likely result in self-fulfilling prophecy.

A "short" is a bet that the price will fall.
People are making 10x, 100x, or even 1000x shorts that the bitcoin price is about to fall.
Basically if the price goes back to like 5800 - 6000 or lower they'll make 10x, 100x, or even 1000x their bet...
However, if the prices goes up their accounts will get completely liquidated because they won't have the money to cover their bet if the price goes up any more, so the exchange just takes their money) then it usually results in an upwards price rally because all the people betting against bitcoin suddenly got booted out of the market.
Seeing tons of shorts means you can expect a major move in price, either up or down.
In theory this seems like an awesome way to make money.  In practice, if you make these kinds of bets regularly, you're probably going to wind up losing money.

No one is forcing you to.  And if you think I'm suggesting that you should, you're wrong.  You should mitigate your risks if you've already lost too much.  Frankly, just based on how you type, I really don't believe you invest in stocks and real estate at all, but if you do good on you.
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:08:29
That's fine, you made a mistake.  Maybe investing isn't for you if you don't want to adjust your investment strategies, or maybe only BTC isn't.
For me, BTC is just one of many side-projects.  I also like stocks, real estate, and other speculative assets.  I also made sure to get a degree and my primary source of income is my job, not BTC price speculation.  I would never take a loan based on speculation, in fact, for every $1 I've put into BTC in the last year I've put at least $1 towards my retirement (between 401k and IRA) and at least $1.35 on my student loans.  BTC would be the first thing I stopped investing in if money became tighter.
If you want to take the position of "lol, down down down" based on one massive failure, that's your right.

I'm saying another popular crypto sub is less pro-BCH than this one.  I thought that was pretty clear.

Ah the ol' "I heard Buffet say a thing one time" routine.
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:49:41
Blatant gambling addictions caused this crash.  People selling their houses and taking out personal loans is exactly what caused us to go parabolic, and when banks and credit issuers stopped allowing investment into crypto as much of it as possible things went downhill...  Those bad investments need to be paid back somehow.  And since the guys who took out the loans obviously have 0 money to their name now, they'll liquidate their BTC to start paying the interest.
When the news is full of stories like "MAN SELLS ENTIRE HOUSE TO BUY BITCOIN" and "VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE TO EXPLICITLY FORBID BUYING BITCOIN" then it's pretty obvious that the market is in a **blind** frenzy, not a healthy state.  When everyone is touting hundreds of projects that don't even have real-world applications yet as killers of a simple ledger/value-storage system (btc) then you know most people have their heads up their asses.

If ignoring my car problems resulted in me maybe walking into my garage a year later and having 5 cars, I might ignore my problems more often too.
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:04:52
It's not making me mad, I'm just telling you that diving in when the price was visibly parabolic was a bad investment strategy, and so is picking a random price-point at which you'll start buying again.

Last bear market was 2 years long and it dipped from 1200 to 200.
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:32:51
So basically you took out loans in order to buy btc and probably alt coins, which everyone in the space would have told you not to do, stuck it all in the market in one giant lump sum, which everyone in the space would have told you not to do, and now you have to liquidate your btc to pay off the interest?
Maybe it's time to take advice from others in a level-headed manner instead of blindly bull-rushing in.
@_date: 2018-08-12 06:00:50
No, that's a price drop.
But an 8 month period of sideways/downwards movement is a bear market, which is obviously why I said "the last bear market was 2 years long."
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:17:43
Not for all the people who sold their houses and took out massive personal loans to buy in.  IMO the hyperbolic inflation last year was due to them, and the gigantic sell-off was due to those same people needing to liquidate in order to pay off the interest as soon as they realized they were down.

The last bear market was 2 years long and it dropped from 1200 to 200 in that time, so arbitrarily picking the end of the year as a marker is... Well, arbitrary.
