No idea, but I suspect a lot. 
Due to the (moronic) cash settled nature of the future a hedged holder is more or less obligated to convert his BTC to USD closely before the settlement date. 
For shares and other futures this is not immediately a problem because you deliver the shares. The current cash settlement system of the futures on bitcoin forces holders to sell the bitcoin for cash. In the last month there has been a continued opportinuty to do riskless arbitrage which is now coming back in full force ( 
Also interesting: this is only the CBOE future that expires (also on 14/2 and 14/3). There are also futures on CME that expire every last trading friday of the month. The CME futures are coupled to a basket of markets. The CBOE futures are  only couple to gemini. It would be interesting if you were a financial (extremly) savvy twin that holds a lot of BTC to have written a shit load of futures coupled to your own exchange. 
If you start selling, you can push the price down (Gemini is not that big in volume) and you can cash in on your BTC in large volume. Also possible to use to proceeds to double your BTC holdings. 
Still trying to found out the total amount of net short positions in the futures, but for some reason this is hard to find.

These are probably retail investors' tears and can cause a big blowback to the bitcoin climate. 
All of a sudden I'm currently more interested in getting some government regulation in crypto that forbids (US Investment) banks from getting into this space. 
These Futures are really, really badly designed and almost made to cause harm to the buyer (and profit to the seller).

on  they publish the open put call positions. This is not available for BTC however. 
Bloomie terminal would give you that feedback. On the 29th (last time I had access), there was an open put position (net of calls) of +/- 100.000 BTC (or a value of 100m). 
Note that due to the cash-settlement nature of the futures, you would expect these net puts to be covered by people actually holding BTC ... if they need to settle the contract it means they have to sell the BTC for USD. This system more or less assures that buyers of BTC futures are automatically fucked by default as the price of BTC will probably go down every time there is a settlement date.

CBOE: 14/2, 14/3 (etc)
CME: every last trading friday of the month

It has, because the futures are cash settled and not BTC settled. 
All future sellers can get 100% hedged by holding BTC (in a wallet). It is just settlement time. Expect more of this the coming weeks. it was CBOE that launched the first futures. CME futures expiry is on 26/1. Next CBOE expiry is 14/2... this will be the new normal. 
Wall street should stay out of BTC.

If you want to sell large quantities of bitcoin, you write a future contract. 
Let's say the bitcoin price at that time was 15.000 usd. You have to post 3.750 usd in margin. 
Some one who buys the future at the same time, will also have to post 3.750 usd in margin.
If bitcoin goes to 10.000 USD, the future writer receives 5.000 USD, the future buyer has to pay 5.000 usd \(note that during the drop he had to increase his margin to remain in the contract\). 
If you own a lot of bitcoin and you want to sell them, it's better to write a future contract since your price is stable \(eg farmers 2.000 years ago did this\). The  nice thing about bitcoin is the the market is much more illiquid than many people assume, and that a large investor can easily put downward pressure on the market by selling large quantitities right before the expiration date. 
Note that the current cash\-settle future contract designed by CBOE and in a few weeks Goldman, are only designed to allow people to exit the bitcoin market 'under the radar' in large volume, and are not intented to increase the usability or acceptance of bitcoin in the main financial system in any way.
Currently the 'no ownership' proposition is keeping banks from owning \(or not owning\) bitcoin outright. 
Investment banks are designed to take advantage of other persons greed and/or stupidity and have no intrest in advancing the world.

The review is only a publication of  independent  research, and not the view of the St\-Louis Fed. 
 *Review* is a quarterly journal of national and  international economic research, particularly focusing on monetary  issues. Aimed at economists, economics professors and others interested  in such research.  
the same issue contains 2 articles that are "negative" on bitcoin
 [Blockchain: What It Is, What It Does, and Why You Probably Don’t Need One]( 
 [Is Bitcoin a Waste of Resources?]( 
Although the other articles contain interesting statements like "blockchain is often described as consisting of \(among other things\) an *immutable ledger*. To me, this is like defining *a titan*ic to be a*n unsinkable sh*ip "
Also, the article  mentioned  in this post argues that bitcoin is a good alternative for cash transaction, especially when anonymity and, but that wider adoption in the financial system is highly unlikely as direct deposits at the central bank are a good alternative to avoid the risk of putting your money in a bank. 
The writer is a professor in Switserland and has no affiliation with the FED or actors in the US monetary system

It's the reverse. Owning bonds is the equivalent of taking fiat 'off exchange' and owning the private key directly. (the alternative being get it in cash but this becomes unpractical &gt;10m)
A lot people (mostly institutions but anyway) don't want to hold their fiat at a bank (exchange) which drives the price of bonds lower.
The government wants to avoid this by pushing interest rates lower and forcing people in banks  but most people or like fuck this, I don't want it on an exchange/bank even if it costs me money.
