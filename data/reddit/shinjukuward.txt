My favorite part is buying the dip and then that dip taking a dip right after I bought the dip. aka “double dip”.

Do this through GDAX and then do a wire transfer from GDAX and before 1pm PST. Will show up same day, maybe like 2-3 hours. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:20:49
Weird. If you do it before the 1pm (PST Time) it gets in same day. I’ve done multiple already. Takes like maybe a few hours at the most to actually deposit into GDAX.

Craigslist has a option you can check mark on to let people know you accept crypto. In the description you can mention you want Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:34:58
Here is a simple solution. Don’t report it.

The new safe haven.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:30:09
Why not? Because GDAX is faster and cheaper. it's only a $10 fee and you get it same day so long as you make the wire before 1PM (PST U.S Time). I'm guessing some people don't know you can literally login into GDAX with your Coinbase login info. 
You pay fees with Coinbase and it takes forever. Not sure why I got the downvotes.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:09:05
I agree. Too Low. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:48:25
I would buy that educational package for 29.99. /s
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:42:03
I’m sure there is a market. Personally I wouldn’t buy because of the branding of the website/company, feels too generic, almost dollar store like, and so I feel like I’d be getting a low quality product. That is my impression of what some others might think clicking on the site. The shirt designs themselves are nice. 
Branding and Design are of extreme importance. 
Facebook ads are popular. Perhaps give that a shot. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:07:10
Great question and great post. 
My guess is it would go up? People would move money into crypto which is deflationary in nature (at least those with a hard cap supply). 
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:21:05
Yes it’s called buying a Trezor or Ledger Nano S. More safe that way.

I’m so happy that scam platform is shutting down. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:38:03
We so badly need lightning. Not just because it will dramatically reduce congestion and lower already high fees. More so because it will really give Bitcoin a...jolt in terms of use case and adoption and bring new life to it. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:21:26
Not a lot of people know that.

I don’t understand the lambo posts. Why not get a Tesla P100D with Ludicrous Mode. Would be cheaper and faster than any lambo you can get. 
Or better yet. The Next Gen Tesla Roadster. Fastest car in the world for only $200k (assuming you don’t get founders edition). 
Don’t forget lambos are expensive as fuck to maintain. I dont think people realize the upkeep costs in keeping the car too.

Don’t listen to these people saying to buy off eBay. Seriously, don’t be stupid. Better safe than sorry. Some guy lost his entire savings buying a Ledger off eBay. 
The only trusted source is the manufacturer themselves. Buy direct from Ledger.  That’s how I know it was not tampered with 100%.

Stop fucking day trading and HODL. You’ll make more money long term doing so. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:56:05
Agreed. Transfer to GDAX then FROM GDAX you send yo wherever you are trying to send to. It’s free. Through Coinbase you pay fees.

3.) Bitconnect is dead.
Another positive of this hard dip. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:00:58
We need this so so bad. Once lightning is implemented fully, I think more retail stores would start to accept it again. There would be way more adoption in general. I’d use Bitcoin to transfer to Binance instead of say Ether or Litecoin to buy alt coins.

@_date: 2018-01-19 07:02:36
Correct. GDAX is literally owned by Coinbase, so much so you can login into GDAX with your Coinbase login info. 
Doing a wire through GDAX is done same day and only $10 fee. 
Through Coinbase, it takes several days and there are more fees.

You should be using GDAX for large sums like that. Not doing it on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:24:38
I mean we kind of had a feeling about this to begin with? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:56:53
Most likely they use GDAX (literally owned by Coinbase). 
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:38:01
I regret not having more money at the moment to buy more. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:11:00
It’s more so speed. We need lightning for mass adoption. I can’t be waiting over an hour to confirm a transaction when cash is instantaneous and credit cards are processed in seconds. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 07:25:58
@_date: 2018-09-29 00:16:58
Because ironically it will help with adoption, which is what we need more of. Adoption.

Well it’s not literally. These contracts are not going to be like the CBOE where they don’t even touch the underlying asset (Bitcoin). You’ll have an account (some kind of wallet) for which the bitcoin will be delivered to you on a daily basis. Each contract is worth 1 Bitcoin it looks like. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:57:03
I would say that chart is accurate because I’m for sure depressed right now. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 00:15:53
Actually it was more a lack of custodian(s) and investor insurance issue. No ETF applications properly addressed those issues but the CBOE looks like it does. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:06:14
That is pretty much the same as Gold alone.

If you are not in a rush, I would  transfer money to Coinbase Pro wallet and then set a limit order, I think the fees are fractions of a percent to nothing if I’m not mistaken. I know there are no fees if you set a limit sell. 
Coinbase accepts debit cards and CB Pro does not. So if you are in a rush you are stuck using Coinbase between the two.

It doesn’t matter because they both serve different purposes. Bitcoin will always be at the top. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:55:36
Have you tried using Coinbase Pro instead? Usually much much higher limits there vs regular Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:39:44
Actually you can write of any lost gains i think up to $3K annual on your taxes which is awesome. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 02:44:22
No issues with Chase. If I make a withdrawal from Coinbase Pro specifically, I usually get it by 2pm the next day. 
I recommend using a debit card for instant transactions.

I don’t consider checking account to be investing because I get 0%. Nothing. With investing you are expecting returns in the long term future and looking at an asset based on fundamentals (examples in this case are user adoption, mining/hashrate, etc). Speculation is essentially short term trading by definition. Decisions based on High risk, Technical Analysis, Psychology, etc.
Bitcoin/Crypto seems to be this new hybrid class. It has elements of the definition of “investing” and “speculation” at the same time.

There will be a crash. Things do not go up forever, at some point what goes up, must come down. Physics. 
When? Who knows. Maybe in the early 2020’s? I dunno. I would be more worried about a currency crash (U.S Dollar) than stock market, because that would affect anyone who uses U.S Currency/more people very directly. I know it’s a bit ironic to say that in a Bitcoin post, to be worried about that.
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:47:31
It’s fractions of a percent (if you dont use BNB token to offset fees). Not even that expensive. On top of that most people are not day trading. I don’t know anyone is seriously interested in buying or trading equities. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 19:29:11

Well it depends on when you initially acquired that 1 bitcoin. Forks take snapshots of holdings before the actual fork event. 
So If I bought 1 bitcoin at this moment, I would not get any forked coins from the past. Only from today and moving forward.

- Bitcoin Genesis Day (date of genesis block)
- Satoshi’s Birthday 
- Bitcoin Birthday (either when the idea was first conceived or maybe when the white paper was first published date, probably the second one)
- Maybe the first day of the financial crisis in 2008 should be noted? Bitcoin was brought to life because of those events. (Though probably not a “fun” sounding holiday but rather a point of history).

I’ve always imagined a fun design series where you take various coins and make a mini city out of them like how some parts of this picture are created. Like if each coin was a city, what would that city look like, be like, etc.

Step 1: You and your dad downloads a bitcoin wallet app. 
Step 2: Your dad buys bitcoin through localbitcoins
Step 3: Once he receives the bitcoin into his bitcoin wallet, he then sends it to your bitcoin wallet public address. 
Step 4: You wait for confirmations and you’ll get your dads bitcoin into your wallet
Step 5: Go to a Bitcoin ATM and sell your bitcoin there. This is the quickest and most convenient way to sell if you do not want to create an exchange account. That could take a while to verify and what not. ATM fees might be a tad more expensive than a exchange.

"When there's a gold rush, start selling pickaxes.
Some of the most successful entrepreneurs of the California Gold Rush never touched an ounce of gold, selling pickaxes, jeans, and tents to gold miners looking to strike it rich. You can even still buy a pair of Gold Rush-era Levi's to this day.
Cryptocurrencies are the new gold. Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, supports more accounts than Charles Schwab.
A new set of companies is working behind the scenes to provide infrastructure and services – pickaxes – to power the cryptocurrency and blockchain boom."

That actually is the point of smart contracts. Essentially you can get rid of Kickstarter almost entirely with smart contracts. 
So I launch a campaign with a smart contract based of Ethereum let’s say. 
I have a set goal. All money gets funneled to said smart contract like a escrow. If I reach said programmed goal, the money gets sent to me. If it doesn’t reach the goal in the time I set it to, the money gets automatically refunded to each person.

If you did sell, you still didn’t really lose anything.

How many times do I wish I knew of Bitcoin a year ago when it was under $1k...or even many years ago when it was cheaper than that. 
I’m not worried at one bit about Bitcoin. 
When Bitcoin gets back to it’s ATH and if you bought $50K worth right now, that could become $150K. I might wait a few days to see if it drops further so you’d get in at a better price.

It’s true what he is saying. 
Any kind of big move happens not throughout the year but in a very very short period of time. What happened in the winter really happened over the course of about only 30 days. 
Things feel crappy now in general but when it ends up moving upward, it will in a big way and in a short period of time.

It’s subject to self employment tax. The IRS looks at mining as a business. So if you mine, it’s looked at like if you are running a business and generating income on a daily basis. 
If you mine more than $40K a year, it’s recommended you create a LLC as a way to reduce the tax bill.

Use GDAX to make the transfers and all transfers, no matter how small or big. I’ve had no issues using GDAX. 
Quicker and less in fees if not free If I remember, it’s been a while since I’ve done a transfer. 
If it’s over 10K absolutely do a wire transfer through GDAX. Doing it normal bank transfer is what might cause problems and even more so through Coinbase.

Right and on top of that there is no way to create “paper bitcoin” when everything is on the ledger. It’s easy with gold because you can’t even track the stuff. With Bitcoin, all one needs to do is ask for or provide an address for proof of ownership. You can’t “fake” ownership of Bitcoin itself.

@_date: 2018-07-05 02:15:47
Let’s see....
With an Bitcoin ETF I can allocate some of my retirement funds towards it. So what does that mean? 
If you work at a awesome company, they most likely will match your contribution up to a certain amount towards your 401K and/or IRA. Most places match 50% of what you put  in, some amazing places might do 100% match. 
Okay whats your point?....
Well that is free money my friend. Let’s say I max out my IRA at $5500 in a year. Well that could be anywhere from $2250-$5K from the company you work that is added along with your contribution. I can take that and allocate it towards a Bitcoin ETF. 
It gets even more interesting considering max contribution on a 401K is $18,500. Now most people probably won’t max that out in a year, but that is another opportunity for more free money from your company.
I can’t take $5K right now and go buy Bitcoin on Coinbase and then go to my company or employer And say “Hey can you match this contribution?”. 
That is one reason why a Bitcoin ETF is important. 
Sure I’ll buy Bitcoin on my own and have my own wallet but I’ll also use my retirement plan as leverage to get free money for which that would be free Bitcoin essentially. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:59:19

It’s called leveraging your money. If you have good credit you can get really low interest rates. If the car is $5K or lower, sure buy it with cash. I’m assuming a average new car of $20K+ 
Putting all your money into a illiquid non-asset is one of the dumbest things you can do. Instead make the monthly payments and take the remainder of the money and invest it in other areas, grow that money. Not a problem at say 2% interest.

Bitcoin ETF’s would be great because one could leverage your retirement accounts with your employer (assuming they are a good employer and match 50-100% of your input into your IRA/401K).

Scenario 1 - Bitcoin makes that move in the winter (one last double up, like you can see it previously done, before that large U shape going into 2017), making all of 2019 a bear market until 2020 and the halving.

Yes...please tell that to the millions and millions of people out there who have no clue how to properly buy and store Bitcoin. 
On top of that I can leverage the ETF in my retirement accounts. I can buy and store Bitcoin on my own, sure. But the only way to get free money (employer IRA/401K match) is through my retirement accounts. That is where a Bitcoin ETF would be so beneficial. Essentially through employer match, I’d be getting free Bitcoin because I would funnel that money into the ETF.

You literally have to buy Bitcoin. I don’t understand your argument of “they might not buy bitcoin, they might not”. 
On top of that, it would be nearly impossible to have “paper” bitcoin because everything is on the ledger. You can access the address of the ETF holder as long as you have a internet connection. You can’t access gold vaults. So with gold you really have no idea if they actually have it or not. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:00:32
Which is why it is highly likely it will be approved. The two biggest issues of SEC not approving an Bitcoin ETF is...
1.) Lack of insurance/protection for investors. What happens if your Bitcoin gets stolen or something gets hacked and you lose the private keys, etc? How are customers/users protected? 
2.) Lack of worldwide regularity clarity.
1.) CBOE has acquired insurance. So investors are protected in the case of a hack or stolen funds or lost private keys. Look at Mt.Gox as an example of no protection for investors when that whole situation happened. 
2.) Well there is clarity now in the sense that the biggest markets Korea and Japan have regulations in place to regulate exchanges.

That looks exactly like the Japanese Stock Market (Topix) from 1950-1972, before shooting upward some 400x in the next 20 years until 1990. 
 
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:16:17
Yeah but you have to feed them and actually care for them. Bitcoin, I just sit back and live my life while it does it’s thing. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:03:30
Have you been watching Fast Money? Probably not.

Well A.I will eventually put them out of business. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:24:36
Should’ve gotten a Tesla...
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:35:07
Well she got scammed hard.
Bitcoin does not physically exist at all. It’s purely digital. Those coins like in the link you provided are commemorative coins. Fun little thing to own. I own one just for kicks. It’s fun to have a physical representation of Bitcoin. 
Also when the price of Bitcoin is near the $9K mark and someone is trying to “sell” you Bitcoin for $700, that should’ve been a giant red flag. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:16:36
1.) That is assuming you didn’t buy any altcoins as well. If you only bought Bitcoin and Bitcoin only and didn’t sell, you are correct. Using Bitcoin to buy an Alt is considered a taxable event and a selling event. You still have to report that you own it though. 
2.) You are totally wrong. If you sold at a loss, you absolutely can claim any amount of losses on your taxes up to a total of $3K. Which is awesome if you owe taxes anyways outside of crypto. 
Now this is all assuming you are in the U.S 
Source: Just finished my taxes. Woot! 
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:06:06
Yup! 18 (today) is now technically the last day because of the IRS website glitch yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:13:26
Not solving a problem? Did you just join this thread? 
Also I think it’s more of a gamble, taking out student loans to pay for a degree for which you can’t even get a job in. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:48:28
In fact it almost looks like the B’s on this note has the same typography as the B on the Bitcoin Logo itself. 
The bottom opening of the B on the note is a tad shorter than the bottom of the B on the Bitcoin logo. 
The lines that extend out of the B letter itself are a bit longer on the Bitcoin logo than on this note. 
Otherwise they look almost identical in shape. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:51:08
Didn’t he call crypto a scam at some point? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:16:56
5 years? 
Oh hell yeah right now! While the price is still low! We haven’t gone into bull market yet, eventually soon. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 04:56:43
Practical: Next Gen Tesla Roadster. Cheaper to maintain (because there is nothing to maintain except tires and maybe brakes), fastest production car in history (no one will beat you unless they have a formula 1 car) and it’s cheaper than lambo. 
For kicks: Hypothetically if I had multi-millions, I would also get a lambo for fun just to own one. Something about it that is magnetic, I can’t lie. 
Bonus: I’m assuming the roadster will also have autopilot + full self driving capability. 
Now...imagine going to a track and going 250mph while it’s in full self driving mode. Uh...so long six flags great america? haha.
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:54:09
$75K end of year before then crashing down to about $30K and consolidating there. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:46:46
Wait until Fall/Winter 
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:12:37
Funny thing is how the B’s are angled like the Bitcoin logo.
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:19:03
The same pattern has happened in the past. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:13:54
Well it will be the U.S who will be doing the dumping in the next 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:37:11
But the fact you sold is reason to report if that was a real example. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:00:46
That is a still a huge difference compared to a lower valuation. Vs if Bitcoin was $100-$1000, that is a factor of 10. $5-$50 just for that coffee. 
Vs $50K-$150K. $5-$15 for that coffee. 
On top of that, you wouldn’t see those drastic number changes in that short period of time as you get higher in price. Will it drop? Yes of course. But not like $50K in 1 day. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:21:33
[Better link]( 
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:39:37
It will surge to $60-70K before eventually crashing down to about $20-25K and consolidating at that point. 
So real price $25K 
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:02:45
Right....so explain why Mercedes would be buying Tesla’s to then try to reverse engineer them? The irony. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:05:21
I reported my stuff. I’m not messing around. Now I can rest easy not trying to hide from the IRS. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:44:36
 I like the parts when it goes vertical and doesn’t stop going up. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:14:24
Next time use cointracker.io
Cost like $50 but so so worth it. 
It takes API’s from exchanges and wallet addresses and connects all the pieces together. It then automatically fills out the tax forms required to report crypto gains. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:05:38
Taxes. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:32:20
When you stop asking. Come back in a few years. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:37:52
Nah it hasn’t. Tax season isn’t over and there is a lot of money still owed to the IRS. Bull Trap here is my bet. 
End of month when i think it would start. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:05:50
It’s a fan made video. Elon had nothing to do with this...
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:28:04
I assumed that was a mistake. Because it is. Having driven both cars, there is literally no comparison. Inside a Mercedes with all those buttons and terrible user design and feeling like I’ve traveled back in time 20 years. Almost like using a flip phone. Vs in the Tesla, it’s like an iPhone on wheels. Clean design, fast, and futuristic. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:32:27
Those negative comments sound like so many people on this subreddit today. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:21:44
Who said it is to be used as a global currency? I’m sure it will be accepted as payment (it is today) but I don’t think it will be a direct replacement to say the dollar. It’s more digital gold and store of value. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:33:28
Nice Tesla
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:07:43
I almost would be worried about her personally. Hopefully you raise a child that becomes humble and grateful. A crap ton of money sometimes changes people for the worst. Because Bitcoin will be worth a ton by then I’m sure. 
I do like the idea of keeping it a secret. That way they don’t become mentally spoiled early on. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:58:28
Actually the only way it stabilizes and can be used as an everyday currency is it going way way higher in price. 
Buying a $5 coffee when Bitcoin is worth $100 lets say, can make that coffee way way more expensive in the long run. 
Buying a $5 coffee when Bitcoin is worth &gt;$100K is not as volatile. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:35:40

Best way probably is a Bitcoin ATM. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:01:23
Well that is probably one of the most prominent features of Bitcoin. I for sure would add in that fact. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:15:39
In 1-2 years. They are going to look like a genius. Though having to already start paying in 2 months is not good timing.

The only ICO i actually would buy into.

Lol yeah I was going to say...
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:47:20
With the amount of student debt going around in general, it pretty much is already ruined for a good while anyways. 
And it's not really a gamble. This isn't a casino. That would be stupid. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:32:32
Yes if it’s denied or delayed. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:17:56
I believe it’s more tax season being over on the 17th.

First off all no one would buy from any name associated with madoff. And also if you are buying an ETF from a “Johnny O’Nest”, you got issues. I’d only be buying from a Vanguard, Fidelity, etc. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:35:20
All the action tends to happen some in the summer and mostly in Q4 (October-December). It coincides with the 80/20 rule. 
80% of gains come from 20% of the year. Within a 2 1/2 month time frame. The  rest of the year is stagnate or in the red. Usually. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:38:23
Interesting data points.

You are right. That is why I’ll never buy a Mercedes.

It’s more like a liability credit. It does not reduce your taxable income. 
On top of that it is roll over able year after year. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:57:08
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:31:33
You are the retard.
Average credit card is some 15% interest. 
Highest return of a investment vehicle I know of is an index fund of about 8% average return a year. 
Paying off the credit card will yield you higher returns personally and put more money in your pocket and you wont lose so much money to interest. So if you have any debt (loans, credit cards, etc) that has a higher interest rate than 8%, you are much better paying that off asap. 
I’m not including crypto in this explanation to keep it simple as an example. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:44:32
Technically....children are money burning, depreciating non-assets. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:28:37
Exactly. So it’s weird, even if you sell at a loss, it can be to your advantage come tax time. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:43:32
This is a great question. I would talk to a crypto tax preparer. If you live by a major city, you should be able to find them. 
Chances are with that kind of money, you will absolutely be creating a pass through LLC. That’s my guess. So I’d talk to them first and then go from there. It would be much easier withdrawing to a “business account” than a personal account when we are talking about that much money. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:49:41
Hell no. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:39:21
And I like to buy an actual car. Not something that is more of a status symbol.
