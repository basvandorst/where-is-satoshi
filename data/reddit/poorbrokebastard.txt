Lmao, you claim that segwit scales more than big blocks. 
Segwit chain (btc) will have max transaction capacity of 6-7 TPS. 8mb bitcoin has 24 TPS. 
So what does it matter the shape of the graph, being liner or exponential? Point is big blocks scale orders of magnitude more than segwit. That's what counts 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:57:57
Factually incorrect, most big blockers support second layer solutions like LN, as long as it doesn't effect the main thing which is proper on chain scaling. Big blockers do not support segwit though mainly for technical reasons.

My plan is a little different. I believe there will be fake buy support on UASF coin. It is my opinion that the intention of the fake buy support will be to prop the market up to make it seem like there is real support for UASF coin.
Anyone holding bitcoin at the time of the split will receive coins on both chains. When I believe UASF chain has acquired significant buy support, I will dump into it, taking the profits back to legacy bitcoin. 
It is my goal to increase my stash of bitcoin by 20% with this maneuver.

Blocks can scale well above 1mb without effecting centralization, all the way to 4mb, according to Cornell:
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:46:09
Which is why segwit is completely useless when we can just scale block size. Segwit offers nothing useful over just increasing the block size. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:09:01
Right, we need scaling without centralization. It's called bigger blocks
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:19:10
lmao... Well, FAR more absurd then that is the notion that the network should be supported by raspberry pi's lmao. What properly functioning global payment network would NOT require expensive hardware upon mass adoption? Honestly wtf are you expecting?

@_date: 2017-07-12 17:51:19
The title of this post indicates otherwise. It clearly claims block size is a security parameter, which is misleading. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:38:04
Block size is not a security parameter. 
What you may be thinking of is the artificial 1mb cap, the block size limit, which was placed as a temporary anti spam measure, or anti DOS measure as you said. It was placed in 2010, to prevent people from spamming the network, but since we have matured now, it's no longer necessary. 
Please understand the difference though: The temporary 1mb cap was an anti spam measure, but the block size itself is different, it determines how many transactions can be processed per block. 
Right now it is woefully capped at 1mb, but it needs to get bigger, satoshi told us how to do it:
The protocol itself is built in to scale to 32 mb, if we remove the limit, blocks will scale as normal. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:50:50
There's no such thing as "economic majority." That's a made up term that has no real relevance here. 
I know what you're trying to say though, and "economic majority" that you imagine existing has the right to choose what chain it wants.  It's a free market and this is capitalism 
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:45:23
That would also include the addition of segwit which is what us big blockers are hoping to avoid. The reason why we want to avoid that is because we see a block size increase as the ONLY necessary form of scaling. We see segwit and second layer solutions as unnecessary, and we believe the people pushing them are doing so with a profit motive. 
Adding segwit adds security risks:
And segwit actually consumes more bandwith per transaction than simply raising the block size, which is an unsustainable way to scale:
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:37:24
You are completely incorrect. 
A Big Block bitcoin network would still be trustless, immutable, decentralized and anonymous meaning: 
1 - Trustless - There is no need to trust in a 3rd party. Paypal is the trusted third party in that equation. On big block network, there is none. 
2. Immutable - Payments or payment history can not be rewritten or altered on Big block network, like they can on paypal.
3. Decentralized - there is no governing body to stop you from sending or receiving money from whoever you want anywhere in the world, unlike paypal which can control that. 
4. Anonymous - You need to verify a hell of a lot of information about yourself to use paypal. With bitcoin, big blocks or small blocks, you don't have to do any of that. 
So there are 4 concrete examples of how a Big Block network would be drastically different from Paypal, just the same way bitcoin is now. NEXT

Excuse me? It's a study from Cornell University, didn't realize that was bullshit, sorry. Link again:
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:32:42
Actually that's not true, using Asic boost gives more hash rate per unit of electricity consumed. That's the whole point of it. So it increases the efficiency of the network. 
Whatever people's opinions of Asicboost, it DOES still provide an optimization, and increases the security of the network. I see no realistic situation where the person that came up with something like that would NOT want to patent it, or profit off it, and I'm sure it was not free for them to come up with. (R+D, etc). 
We are all entitled to our personal opinions about the implications there, but I just want to be clear that Asic boost DOES increase the hash rate of a given miner.

@_date: 2017-07-01 18:36:00
So the chart is blurry, but is that why it is incorrect? I am not interested in discussing a BIP or whitepaper, the technical concerns raised in the video are what interests me:
- is it true that bitcoin is a turing complete machine?
- Is it true that there are 1 &amp; 2 nm transistors now? What does that mean for the notion that "Moore's Law is dead?"
- Is it true that segwit transactions, due to their quadratic nature actually consume MORE bandwith per unit of work done than a big block transaction?
Thanks in advance, there will be more questions shortly. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:10:50

"Off chain" has a different meaning then "off chain scaling." Exchanges doing transactions is not scaling, scaling is increasing the capacity of the network, totally different. So you are misunderstanding him, but everything he said is correct.

Even if it's an upper bound, we can still scale to that today without issues and then more down the road. Moore's law is alive and well, our technology is getting better every day, we should just scale on chain. People want to choke the main chain by refusing on chain scaling, and then they want to sell their second layer solution where they make the fees. It is wrong and people are attempting to hijack bitcoin. The truth is on chain scaling is all we needed from the beginning, you can find more information about it in the Bitcoin White paper, the writings of Satoshi Nakamoto and the other sub, the "free speaking" sub. We would love to have you. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:36:20
"Size" refers to a number of users or number of transactions, as bitcoin itself does not have mass and does not therefore have a true "size" that can be physically measured. So you are really splitting hairs over my wording. Scaling refers to an increase in usage.
"On chain" only refers to a TYPE of usage. Scaling refers to an INCREASE IN usage. But you already understand that, and are just toying with the semantics of what I said. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:55:34
I'm not a fan of segwit. There's a huge security flaw in it, and it requires more bandwith per transaction than a normal one - meaning we reach a scale ceiling with it sooner than if we would just increase blocks, as has been the plan the whole time. The fact that there is even a debate about this is silly.
I support Satoshi Scaling - scaling as according to planned - which includes increasing the block size, and not segwit or lightning network. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:26:03
"Technical security parameter" wow that is misleading. 
It's not a security parameter, the block size is a very important aspect of bitcoin. Presenting it that way is misleading at best. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:18:24
It is not a bad idea for asic boost to exist. It's something that makes our network more secure. You have to understand that the higher the hast rate, the more secure our network is. So asic boost helps the network be more secure. 
The only real "problem" with Asic boost is the centralized nature of it. It's patented and controlled by Jihan Wu and he profits off of its implementation. But if you are concerned about that, then you should be equally concerned about segwit, as Blockstream has patents on that too, and they will also make a profit off it's implementation. So in all reality, the situation is no different, it's an optimization that helps the bitcoin network, and the people who came up with it have patents, and they will be rewarded for their contribution. So if people don't realize that segwit is basically the same thing, they might need to think about the whole thing a little more. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:48:04
I didn't say anything about block size or number of transactions contained in a block, so not sure where you got that from. 
This conversation is unproductive, so I'm over it, but would you like to take a minute to talk about scaling?
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:16:15
On chain only refers to things being done on chain, while SCALING represents the increasing of the size of something. Major difference, and the wording he used reflected that. 
 
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:35:52
I think this is what he's talking about:
 
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:46:44
I'm just hoping to get a straight answer out of you. I'm just figuring since you guys are the ones advocating for Segwit that you might be able to answer some technical questions. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:11:43
Numerous technical concerns raised in this ^ video please watch. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:33:52
I do know the answer and I'm trying to share it with you. Why does that make you feel hostile toward me? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 23:14:28
Ok great makes sense now. Still though, The real problem with the bitcoin network is not transaction malleability, it's scaling, and segwit is not scaling. If we implement segwit fine but what REALLY needs to happen is increasing the block size. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:09:13
I see a simple block size increase as the obvious solution. It is much more simple, less complicated and it is the original vision of this project. Segwit and second layer solutions go against what we're trying to do, which is make peer to peer digital cash with no central authority. 
The guys that are trying to sell second layer solutions are saying on chain scaling can't work, but they're wrong and the reason why they say that is because they want to choke on chain scaling to sell their second layer solutions, where THEY make the fees. It's all about profit, which is wrong in my eyes. 
I see segwit2x as a compromise - we get the block size increase but it comes at the expense of having the burdensome and poorly thought up segwit. Oh, one more thing, this really smart guy found a huge vulnerability in segwit that kind of makes it insecure...
Regardless of anyones personal opinion of Peter Rizun, his technical assessment in this video is amazing to me, and has been confirmed correct by many in the scene with much more knowledge than me. Plus, he's a really all around knowledgeable dude, I'm sure if you watch the whole video you'll agree. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:25:58
Hah, I Should have said "Almost nobody" instead of "nobody."
In any case, I would rather talk about the information that was revealed at the 2017 Future of Bitcoin Conference. Let me first start by saying that I'm not sure if he is really Satoshi or not, since he failed to sign from the genesis block, leaving us with absolutely NO proof that he is the real Satoshi. I am not claiming he is or is not Satoshi either way. With that out of the way, let's discuss the ideas:
- Is it true that Segwit transactions, being quadratic require a HIGHER amount of bandwith than a big block transaction, for the same utility, as shown in the video?
- Is it true that there is a 1nm transistor? Wouldn't that basically shit on the "Moore's law is dead" argument?
- Is it true that bitcoin is a Total Turing machine? 
I have many more questions so thank you for bearing with me, let's just get these 3 ^ straight first. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:48:10

@_date: 2017-07-03 23:15:24
lol now THAT'S a conspiracy theory...
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:27:13
First of all, the idea that the bitcoin network should be run on raspberry pi's is absurd. Plus, most people aren't supposed to run nodes anyway. Ever heard of SPV?
What makes you think a $20,000 node is any more likely to get seized than a raspberry pi node? Please explain how the cost of the node increases the chances of government intervention. 
Next, please explain how running a network on raspberry pi's is even sensible to begin with. The idea behind your argument is decentralization - well guess what, not every single person can afford to run a pi node either. So really, the only way for it to be TRULY decentralized, is for every single person participating to sit there and be hashing by hand, since that is the ONLY way that EVERYONE can afford to participate, it would be the most decentralized option technically possible. 
Surely you are not pushing for that? So, where do you draw the line? 
Edit: For the record, to more clearly answer your question, I would want to be on the one with powerful nodes run by big businesses because it would still be more secure, and that's how bitcoin is supposed to work. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:15:03
Though it does not explicitly say "low fee," What it says is DECENTRALIZED. That means it's for everybody. When the fees are $20 or $100, you must transact large amounts to make it worth it. Basically, in that situation, we are cutting off billions of people to Bitcoin, billions of people who may want to just send $40 here or $100 there. Basically, you are saying "bitcoin is only for rich people and high rollers who can afford to pay large fees"
We must remember, in some countries, $20 can mean a whole weeks wages for some people. Remember, a large part of our target market is the "unbanked" in third world countries. How are those people going to use bitcoin is the fee is a whole weeks wage? 
That is the OPPOSITE of Satoshi's vision. Satoshi's vision was a decentralized payment network for EVERYONE. Vote Big blocks. Reject Blockstream.

Segwit is designed to remove transaction malleability, it gives a financial incentive to those who adopt it by discounting 50-60% of their transaction cost with a 75% discount.
Transaction malleability can be described like this:
Fixing malleability is like fixing your cat.
It's the owner that gets to define the problem and it's the cat that gets fixed. (The cat works just fine with it's manhood intact)
Malleable transaction haven't stopped Bitcoin from working. In fact malleable transactions prevent types of applications that move fee paying transactions off the Bitcoin network and onto other networks like the Lightning Network - resulting in less fees to pay for bitcoin security
Transaction malleability is a feature that's preventing moving fee paying transactions off the blockchain, fees being a good thing that secure the blockchain as the subsidy diminishes.
Malleability is a behavior that encourages network participants using the network in other ways to have functions other than money confirm on the blockchain. Its functions should be defined and agreed before it's classified as something needing a fix, it's not a bug it's not harmed bitcoin, if anything it's been a scapegoat used to arguer fraud and that bitcoin is not broken and works for everyone, fix this and we fix fraud (NOT).
Bitcoin Transaction Malleability puts individual users who want to be their own bank on the same playing field as multinational corporations who want to use bitcoin to build a private banking layer on top of bitcoin, why remove it?
one can't block segwit2x its a soft fork, One has no choice but to accept it.
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:16:03
Block size is not a security parameter. There was a cap added to block size as a security measure, but block size itself is something different. I have repeated that 3 times now. 
Block size determines how many transactions the network can process by determining how many transactions get into a block. A block comes every ten minutes, so the bigger the blocks, the more transactions we can process. It has nothing to do with security. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:50:00
Blockstream is pushing the false notion that bigger blocks lead to centralization. That is not just erroneous, it is deliberately misleading. 
The truth is that scaling the blocks will only marginally increase hardware requirements and with our technology growing at the rate it is, you can clearly see our hardware scales over time fast enough to keep up with the blockchain growth. With big blocks, we have low fees and fast transactions, making bitcoin true P2P cash - as intended by Satoshi. A simple reading of the white paper confirms this, so don't just take it from me! 
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:18:08
The corporate side of bitcoin does not really make sense. Big block is the ONLY sensible scaling approach as this entire project is based solely on proof of work. Which is why they ALSO look crazy saying the users are in control and miners are not - that is quite the opposite of the truth. haha 
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:59:07
The proof of work is what provides immutability. If you haven't already, I recommend reading the white paper.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:16:15
Welp one of the main reasons why people are here is because they're sick of the banking cartel. If you don't know about it, do a little homework and you'll find out that there's a semi-secret group called the Bilderburd Bank group. They are funding blockstream. Also, read about another lovely organization called the IMF.

@_date: 2017-07-05 23:55:26
Wait so you're saying that segwit 2x necessarily implies a hardfork anyway? I thought that was one of the main arguments against big blocks? Why not just hard fork to big blocks and forget about segwit then?

Big blocks are the only block size increase. Segwit is a trap 
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:02:50
What I said was that it increases the amount of hash rate PER unit of electricity consumed. 
If you're consuming less electricity to get the same hash, then you're still increasing hash rate per unit of electricity consumed. 
What is your opinion about segwit being patented? Can you see how it's an optimization in terms of efficiency, and the people who developed it will make a profit off of it? Do you see how that is very similar to asic boost?

It's not a conspiracy theory.

OH YEAH! Segwit on litecoin network, thanks for reminding me. 
I wanted to ask you why nobody uses it!? 
Is it because they just don't want it?
Or is it because they don't need it since their blocks aren't full?
Either way, it's revealing...
Thanks in advance for the response.

a POW change is not the best way to maintain decentralization. It is by scaling blocks - clearly says this in the whitepaper. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:45:42
lmao...REASONABLE fees are a good thing because they support miners and secure the network, obviously. 
I recommend reading the white paper so you understand what this is all about. POW is the very definition of bitcoin: 
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:51:02
THIS IS NOT IN THE WHITEPAPER 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:23:46
I disagree that segwit is crucial to decentralizing. Seems to me more like the opposite is true. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:26:06
you're delusional 
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:29:21
lmao, no it doesn't, if anything it shows to me that the rebuttal is extremely weak. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:02:57
I'm making perfect sense but you guys are deleting certain comments.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:20:05
you are right, UASF IS more centralized, Do NOT let the bankers fool you into thinking UASF is the right choice. It may be best for them, BUT NOT BEST FOR US!!!

Hash power is the entire basis of what we're doing here. There exists no scenario where hash power is not relevant. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:07:46
This is not the original vision in the whitepaper...changing POW is ludicrous...you guys are toxic...
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:50:01
It won't, that is not the point of increasing the block size, and ASIC's aren't what's holding bitcoin back.

What did he get charged with or arrested for?
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:18:14
You are correct, chriswheeler
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:55:51
The article you read is correct, there is no need for trusted third parties when ON CHAIN scaling is executed properly

r/btc says bitsquare has no market cap 
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:04:31
"yes" is all you needed to say there. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:26:54
"I don't know" "Couldn't tell you" Sorry I just thought you might be able to answer basic questions about segwit since you're pushing it. 
And apparently you can't type "1 nm transistor" into google either, lol:
