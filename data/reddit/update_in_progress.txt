While I agree with your general sentiment, you are completely misrepresenting these quotes. They are referring to the conviction an innocent person, not the banning of some arbitrary action (in this case, innovation through bitcoin). The quotes are related to tradeoffs of the judicial system, you seem to be relating to general freedoms. Misrepresentation is bad, it increases skepticism and makes an argument look weaker. Strive for clarity and accuracy when debating.

I'm not thinking in terms of creditors. It's more along the lines of something like this: My buddy and and I go out to eat at the diner. I happen to be their 10,000th customer for the year and they give me a free pie. Do I share the pie with him, or do I keep it for myself?
As someone who feels very fortunate compared to the average citizen of the world, I personally feel obligated to try to share a good portion of my pie as effectively as I can.
Also, in terms of how one shares their pie, I wasn't really specifying what is best.. That is an unsovled problem. Nonetheless, well directed money is actually pretty effective. Have you seen some of the work Bill Gates has done with poverty and health?

Yes, the ratio would have been different. It is called "selection bias". You don't think that people who are more interested in bitcoin would be more likely to respond to a survery about getting paid in bitcoin?

That doesn't quite work. To calculate market cap, you multiple the number of bitcoins that are not lost by the price of a single bitcoin. The lost bitcoins are not part of the calculation (they effectively don't exist).

You don't think those who are more fortunate have some sort of moral obligation to help make society better? I'm not saying the government is the ideal way of facilitating this, but the randomness of life makes me feel like those who have a lot, in some ways, do owe omething to those who are struggling. Our lives are shaped to a massive degree by our genetics and the environment we grow up in, which are completely random. They influence our resources, skills, interests, psychological makeup, support system, etc. Yes, as adults and even young teens we can work to make adjustments, but it isn't easy. Even the strength of one's work ethic is molded by these factors. I'm still working on these thoughts, and the implications are not completely pargmatic (we are all humans with wants and needs), but the general idea seems pretty compelling to me. Ok, done with my philosophical ramblings :)

It's a reflection of the attitudes I've seen paraded around openly or as an ever present subtext over the past year. They seem to lack understanding of broader social and business contexts and have a great handle on technical elite douchebaggery.
It seems as if they want to keep bitcoin to themselves... instead of letting flourish and grow so that the unwashed masses can make use of it without *GASP* understanding the implications of SegWit-FooBaz-RBF-ABC-BIP1337.
Many also seem to have some strange moral hangup about people making money off speculation as the BTC ecosystem grows. Despite the fact that speculation was one of the biggest catalysts that helped bitcoin reach where it is today.

In the event of a controversial change, the consensus mechanism of bitcoin, miners voting to build the blockchain with new blocks, will **very quickly** reveal the true preferences of the economic majority, those who buy, use, and hold bitcoin (giving it value).
Many believe this is necessary now to prevent bitcoin withering and stagnating.

@_date: 2016-03-04 18:48:15
Correct, there is no "should". So why are we artificially forcing fees in a certain direction? Do you not think miners can handle this on their own, by deciding what transactions to put in the block? 
They have to worry about propagation rates and orphans, and if they get it wrong they will go out of business, so they have strong incentives to do a good job.

People and companies who otherwise would are not making use of the bitcoin network, due to lack of scaling improvements and the resulting governance instability. Hence, the ecosystem is not as valuable and vibrant as it easily could be.

The sky isn't falling, but it's certainly having its potential notably stunted. This upsets a lot of people, for very understandable reasons. The ecosystem growth trajectory, the amount of innovation, and investment in infrastructure, is all lower than it would be if we had just implemented simple block size limit increases that we've known would be necessary for years now.

Bitcoin, unfortunately, is not part of a fairy tale. The real world is more complicated than you think.
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:55:00
That is a very good question. Defining bitcoin is harder than it seems at first =)
My impression is that there will never be two permanent blockchains that attempt to be "Bitcoin". If a controversial fork occurs, one will quickly trend towards zero value as preferences are revealed, thus causing users and miners to abandon the losing chain for the other. Whichever chain remains, is "Bitcoin". This is why 75% is a nice, conservative number, as the preferences are already revealed to be strongly in favor of one side.
In theory, 50.1% favoring a single side is all you need, as the incentives are so strong to be part of the successful chain and not the losing chain. Few business, software, or users would want to support both versions, except for some exchanges which will specialize and facilitate a quicker resolution by allowing people to make their preferences known through betting, options and the like. No one wants to receive coins that will crash in value soon. It is vastly better to be part of the winning ecosystem, so the overwhelming majority (probably at least 99%) of participants in the ecosystem would all quickly coalesce around the preferred chain.
95% is a terrible number, because it presents such a high barrier to letting the economic incentives and network effects solve the debate.
@_date: 2016-03-06 01:44:23
95% basically guarantees that bitcoin will never be able to implement anything that is even slightly controversial. I think this is problematic. The protocol as it exists today is not fully refined, and with various conflicts of interest, misunderstandings, and the plain old fact that people sometimes fear change irrationally, it is unlikely we will reach 95% for certain important changes. I believe that is what happening right now.
Fortunately, the possibility of users &amp; miners downloading an alternative client that does make some desired change is a strong counterweight that may prevent the situation from stagnating to a dangerous degree.
I do agree changes shouldn't be made without careful thought. That is why I like the 75% number, and not something lower like 55% or 60%. But I don't think a single pool or faction should be able to block a change, which is possible with 95%.

@_date: 2016-03-04 01:23:07
They will exist because people will use them to convince miners that it is worth doing including their transaction in the next block. Every additional TX increases the risk of an orphan by a small amount, and the TX fee compensates for this risk. This aspect doesn't depend on the block size limit at all.
It is evolving dynamic that depends on ease of block propagation, demand for transactions, the current subsidy amount, competition between miners, BTC price, etc.

Has anyone actually given any kind of detailed, rigorous proof as to why or how node counts will go down significantly with larger blocks?
My intuition says that if blocks were significantly larger, for example say 5mb or 10mb, then by definition the bitcoin economy would much more vibrant and active (to generate enough activity to fill these larger 5-10mb blocks).
Thus, there would be a larger number of motivated businesses and individuals who would be running nodes.
If I was to make a guess, using my fuzzy intuition, I would say the number of nodes in general would in general be on the order of ~log(number-of-transactions).

How do you measure support when the two largest online discussion forums for bitcoin fervently exert political control over what people are allowed to discuss, and ban those with valid dissenting views?
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:12:46
First, most importantly, **a fee market will exist without block limits**. It is based off the marginal risk of orphan caused by each additional transaction. A bitcoin user needs to pay a fee to convince the miner that adding the transaction to the block is worth the slight additional risk of orphaning. So you don't need a block limit for fees. Peter R wrote a paper on this.
Secondly, humans don't think in terms "coins mined". How long is it to your birthday? 180k coins mined? or 5 months? So we should use time.
Additionally, if bitcoin is to be successful, the value of each coin will go up, so as the subsidy decreases in terms of BTC over *time*, the actual overall value of the reward will still be increasing. This is another reason why we shouldn't measure it by coins mined. That doesn't matter, the $ value of the coins mined is what matters.
The entire point of the subsidy is to motivate miners while the network grows. The network is still in its infancy... it makes no sense to try to replace the subsidy during the time when it is supposed to be facilitating the network's growth.

They want blocks to be full, so that bitcoin can be converted from a payment system into a settlement system. They don't want on-chain scaling. Even though LN hasn't been fully figured out... And on chain scaling **is** possible, as it has been shown repeatedly.

@_date: 2016-03-04 02:25:49
How does any of this imply that fees need to be large? Just because we know there will be fees of some sort, it doesn't mean that the system demands the fees to be high.
In fact, many think that things will work out much better with large numbers of low-fee transactions, especially as propagation techniques techniques improve and other optimizations are implemented, and this is by far the most straight-forward way to take bitcoin to the next level.
Off-chain technologies are still unproven and experimental. They will be extremely valuable as they mature and their implementations are hammered out, and will propel bitcoin to even higher heights.
On the contrary, raising the blocksize is a safe, widely understood understood improvement that will certainly bring continued growth and renewed vitality to the ecosystem. This is why so many people are so angsty at all resistance towards doing so.

10 minutes is plenty fast to be a payment system. And zero-conf transactions (which take a few seconds) work wonderfully in a wide variety of use cases. Credit cards, widely considered a "payment" system, have 90 day settlement times.
What is your argument here?
@_date: 2016-03-02 05:51:25
We don't want bitcoin to be restrained artificially. The blocksize can be safely raised, therefore it should. It can be done soon, therefore it should. Not in a very long 1.5 years from now. We want there to be more bitcoin businesses, software projects, etc. Stifling the blocksize slows this valuable growth down! Who knows what innovations are being delayed or not occurring at all?
The fee market isn't needed for **decades**, so let's not stifle the project in order to prematurely raise fees. Also, **there will be a fee market even with large blocks**. It is determined by the additional risk of orphaning that is caused by adding a transaction to the block, vs the fee that transaction offers. This dynamic exists to the fullest even with no block size limit.
These are the types of thoughts we have. They are grounded, rational thoughts, and they all center around helping the bitcoin ecosystem grow and flourish to the utmost degree. Please stop slandering us with your unfounded claims.

These two sentences are contradictory. Look, I get the optimism around bitcoin. But you are arguing a rather extreme point that very few people would agree with.


You snuck the qualifying phrase "in the market" into your statement. Being "in the market", or not, is part of the context. Clearly, context matters in the decision on whether to buy bitcoin.
In every decision, there are always relevant contextual considerations. Do you really believe this to not be true?
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:15:13
Now you are simply being rude, for no reason...
I came up with a good way of explaining it, so here goes one last try:
You are using the phrase "in the market" as if it is some simple binary attribute that doesn't depend on other factors.
Picture a graph of a supply and demand curve. It has a wide range of values on it, showing how some buyers are "in the market" at one price, but not at other prices. I hope you can see that "being in the market" depends on, at the very least, the price.
And this curve itself is gross simplification of reality. An extremely useful one, but it doesn't capture even close to all of the complexity behind individual and aggregate purchasing decisions.
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:54:16
It seems pretty obvious that there isn't a single action that should be done ALWAYS, without consideration of the context.

Bitcoin Cash is valuable because a large section of the bitcoin ecosystem has been wanting this for years.
Over the coming weeks we will see exactly how much pent up demand there is, but it seems clear that some genuine demand does exist.
No one wants a random fork that was created on a whim. Anyone who releases one of these will quickly realize this fact, as their coin will be valued the same as any other junk altcoin.
The difference between the two scenarios is very clear for anyone who has been following bitcoin. I question the honesty or clear-headedness of those who conflate the two.

They can only unload their "six figures of BTC" once. Bitcoin will carry on, the network will grow (without being unnecessarily and artificially constrained), and the price will recover and reach new highs.

Poe's law is strong with this comment.
@_date: 2016-02-15 00:02:05
The first two points are more important, IMO. Bitcoin woild be 100% fine with a limit bump. I don't currently agree the argument that modest block size raises would damage decentralization, and also think it is obvious there will still be a fee market even if blocks are not full. Also, we shouldn't mess with trying to raise fees until many years later when bitcoin is more firmly established and the subsidy is actually waning... (If at all). The whole point of the subsidy is to bootstrap bitcoin. It boggles my mind that people want to interfere with that and diminish the bootstrapping effect.
@_date: 2016-02-15 00:35:27
Scientific community, LOL. So now core developers are "scientists"? I'm not sure how you missed it, but many of the other "scientists" were vocally saying a modest raise would cause no problems.. Also, you do realize that bitcoin is at least much an economic endeavor as an engineering one? And that core developers don't have particularly noteworthy economics credentials? (Yes, I know, economics in general struggles to adquately tackle the complexity of the modern world, and its experts make many mistakes).
Edit: Also.. I forgot a very important point. Bitcoin doesn't have a "social contract". It has Nakamoto consensus. The longest chain wins.
@_date: 2016-02-15 19:34:34
It would also be worth very little. No one would value those coins, so they would stop mining it. Thus, it would no longer be the longest chain.
@_date: 2016-02-16 01:44:08
Uh, you just said that you weren't talking about 2mb. 2mb is scaling by increasing the blocksize.

It doesn't make sense for prices to be demoninated in bitcoin until it is extremely widespread and as stable as other price-denominating currencies. This is to be expected, and says nothing about bitcoin's ability to grow and succeed.
@_date: 2016-02-16 19:10:14
It was sarcasm :)
@_date: 2016-02-21 05:18:32
This does nothing to explain why we should artificially raise fees many, many decades before the mining subsidy decays away.
Also, it doesn't explain how there won't be a fee market even if the block size limit is large. Hint: there will be one, and the market fee will be based off the marginal cost of including a transaction due to risk of an orphan.
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:04:46
Bitcoin is volatile, hence not suitable for denominating prices. It isn't a very complicated concept. Use logic, not dogma. Bitcoin needs to massively succeed **prior** to ever being used to denominate prices.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:11:16

great rebuttal! 10/10, would read again
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:45:20
It may not get that much more congested, transaction growth could easily just slow due to the existing congestion. Note that this isn't measurable. We can never know how much more the network would grow if the block size limit was raised say, today, instead of 1.5 years from now. The amount of damage is unknown.
I would bet a good amount that the future where the limit is raised very soon has Bitcoin in a much more successful position that the future in which we wait another 1-2 years.
@_date: 2016-02-06 03:20:28

Technical merit is evaluated within a complex context of user needs, different stakeholder incentives, competing product visions, etc. It doesn't exist in some abstract vacuum, as many engineers &amp; developers seem to forget sometimes (I say this as someone who earns a living writing code). Campaigning is one way that humans help navigate this context, and that won't change. As social creatures with complex, varying motivations, this is what we do.
@_date: 2016-02-13 01:23:19
Can you please define what you mean by "objective" and "technical"? I think there is some misunderstanding here.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:12:29
You can't prove adoption hasnt slowed compared to what it could have been due to growing TX backlog as well as decreased confidence from the public in bitcoin's ability to implement simple scaling improvements. I can't prove it has either, but to me it seems likely there has been a noticeable impact.
@_date: 2012-08-10 17:52:17
that totally blows. i guess you gotta test every single aspect of your secure wallet at least twice before you actually start saving real amounts of BTC in the cold wallet

Am I correct in reading that 95% of the coins voting on the "Doubt" side come from just 5 addresses? Looking at the top 5 listed there. I wonder who these heavy hitters are.

You and I are now both speculating, but I think that if the limit had been raised in 2015, the price would be higher now, there would be significantly more confidence in bitcoin, and mining would be less concentrated in China.

Look, you can use whatever logic you want. But it doesn't discount real world facts. Look at this tweet from Roger Ver that I happened upon this morning: 
It basically confirms what I'm saying.
You thinking something "shouldn't" dissuade people doesn't really mean much, especially if that is what is actually happening....  The scaling problems &amp; debates, and related governance issues, are undeniably slowing bitcoin ecosystem development.
@_date: 2012-09-28 22:43:26
my understanding was that in these cases the box was compromised in a way that simply reveals the encryption phrase (key-logger or something of that nature) of the wallet allowing the attacker to decrypt the private keys. I suppose someone could design malware that waits for the user to decrypt the wallet and then tries to locate the decrypted keys in RAM? Is that possible? that would be rather nefarious and 2-fatcor would not help in that case, it seems.

If only we knew some higher ups at the big banks/fed/other relevant organizations so we could  calculate all of the implied "transaction costs" of the traditional system.. That would be a fun comparison.
@_date: 2012-09-28 22:48:17
An two-factor app that relies on input other than keystrokes would help against key-loggers, but I'm sure someone could design malware that dismantles this protection (I don't know how difficult that would be however, so maybe it would offer decent protection).
The smartphone is the most obvious next choice, is there a good way to have an app on the smart phone signal "A-ok" to the wallet? This would definitely add another useful defense layer. The attacker would have to compromise both devices.
EDIT: unless of course the two-factor allowed for malware to "pretend" to be the smart phone and retreive the  decrypted keys this way. I'm speaking a little loosely because I don't know enough about the technical details on how such a system would be implemented.
@_date: 2016-02-26 04:32:55
Do you know how many startups or software projects built around Bitcoin didn't happen because of concerns around ecosystem stability, TX fees, ability to scale (and create larger markets for a business), etc? It's definitely not zero. Hell, I've slowed my buying, and that's just me. Unless you are saying I'm a special snowflake, which seems unlikely.
Joe public, who knows nothing about the blocksize debate, might have been in interested in one of the above offerings, but now it doesn't exist.

It isn't a black market currency. It's a free currency not controlled by anyone. Naturally, black market enthusiasts will take advantage of this, as it provides the most immediate gains to them. But this just shows their insight.
Bitcoin is a huge experiment still, but the ideals behind it are so awesome (we need more checks on the government/ultra-wealthy), and  the upside is so huge, that I think it is a very good high-risk investment.
@_date: 2012-09-28 23:17:48
Are there are any encryption libraries/packages that can interface with an RSA token (or any other similar OTP systems) and that would allow for requiring both a passphrase and authentication by the OTP/token system?
Ideally such a setup would be integrated into a bitcoin client, much like bitcoin-qt has wallet encryption built in.

The gold line is the cumulative volume of buy orders. It gets taller and taller as you go to the left, as the volume of orders placed at lower prices is added to the volume of all buy orders at higher prices.
The blue line is the same thing, except for BTC sell orders (so naturally grows taller as you as go to the right).
The green line is past trades.
I didn't figure this out at first either, hope that helps.

Depends what you want the coins for. If you want to hold them and sell them months/years later for a profit, then you want the best price you can get. Many merchant services that accept bitcoin will adjust for the current exchange rate, so as long as there isn't huge price movements and you spend your coins somewhat soon after purchasing, the price won't matter that much.
Over the past day the price has jumped from the mid $7.xx to around $9. This quick rise without any major news or known reason led some to believe a mini-bubble had formed. The price has since fallen back down to mid $8.xx, and will see what happens.
I feel like anything below $10 is a bargain, but that is just my personal opinion.

Yeah I read the thread quickly, and that was brought up but I wasn't sure if that was confirmed as the reason. Thanks for confirming.

@_date: 2012-12-10 22:36:58


Nice, this is part of the reason I made the post, so others could provider their knowledge. Very cool.


Good point, that makes sense. Altho it is a little disheartening. So the bitcoin currency/payment method system is probably not cheaper than the traditional system. So then it becomes a question of whether or not people think the benefits of bitcoin are worth the extra cost (all else equal, the system with lower costs would be chosen by rational actors). I imagine only a small minority are willing to pay extra for the liberty enhancing features of bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-07-17 06:07:59
No I'm not joking. Bitcoin has true potential, it'd be nice to have some rough idea of how that potential is currently playing out. In terms of real data and analysis.
Yeah I don't think satoshiDICE provides us with much meaningful information. I do agree bitcoin is making progress on becoming more useful, however MUCH improvement is still necessary for it become something that the average person could easily utilize and benefit from.

Yeah that does seem like a fair amount of work. Although I mainly want a safe place to put coins and not spend them so I wouldnt have to worry about exporting/importing transactions. While I have your attention, I have a quick question. Is it really necessary to use a freshly reinstalled comp if you are using LiveCD to create an offline wallet? Or can I use it with my regular laptop? If I understand correctly, the issue is whether or not some malicious program could access the RAM of the LiveCD session and somehow steal the keys from that, which seems unlikely to my uneducated brain.
EDIT: actually I don't think what I am typing makes complete sense (I was thinking of a thread where someone booted a virtual run of Linux from windows, or something like that), but I'm still wondering if I can use my everyday windows laptop and run LiveCD on that, so I'll leave it in its current half-sensical form.

Better yet, multiple auditors competing against each other with transparency levels and expertise!
I know it sounds complicated and all, but golly gee, there must be a way.
@_date: 2012-06-21 16:29:35
Yeah it will be interesting to see how/if it plays out, as having merchants pay for a 3rd party service to manage the payments removes advantage of decentralization and almost non-existent transaction fees.

I had been meaning to set up an offline wallet from a fresh linux liveboot. But I wanted to do it properly where I tested my backups a few times to make sure I was 100% confident in the safety of my coins. I hadn't gotten around to it yet.
I was meaning to do this before I made any big purchases but I got impatient and plus bitfloor seemed really great...
EDIT: I suppose I could have just stored then in my current wallet on my normal laptop with the other few coins I have, I wasn't sure which was riskier. While my laptop theoretically should be secure and the wallet is encrypted, I was still concerned about keyloggers and such.  It appears I made a mistake, and should have trusted my current wallet.

What is with this core priesthood worship? They are not gods... Anyone can make a fork. The only thing that matters is the software that is run by the users and the miners. Do you not get that? If the entire community (users, miners, and industry) switched to a different software, core wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2012-09-06 01:16:46
Yeah it is going to have to be a zero-trust policy until businesses have developed years' worth of trust and provably demonstrated that they have taken all necessary precautions. I am hopeful however though that people will continue to build on all the potential that bitcoin offers. Much work remains to be done.
@_date: 2012-09-22 01:12:22
Hoping to do. If no outside investors step in or bitfloor doesn't somehow MASSIVELY increase trade volume, then it will take at least a year before the funds will be returned (assuming 100% of fees go to repaying losses)

Yeah well I would have saved me $1400. And I suppose it appears that BTC exchanges/services are getting hacked much more often that relatively careful users like me are getting keylogged.
It's kind of funny, but now that I'm pondering it, one of the little mental flags that affected my decision to leave the coins on bitfloor until i set up a proper offline wallet was the fact that 8 years ago someone hacked my runescape account and ruined many teenage months of hard work.. although that was a family computer and I'm a lot better with security now (or apparently not.. hah)
on the plus side, I suppose now I finally have a reason to dig in and learn everything I need to know to feel comfortable with a totally secure offline wallet and the ability to use offline backups to recover coins.

The variance in the quality and nature of the posts on bitcointalk is quite amusing. We have people simultaneously improving the revolutionary bitcoin protocol, trollololing in the speculation section, intelligently debating societal constructs and philosophy, and getting scammed by Ponzi's.

yeah it makes sense, I know the market is quite young. but still it seems there has been many hacks/security issues.

Getting users to download a patch for their client that contains a backdoor like you describe seems like a whole different level of attack, and I would imagine this is much less likely to occur (has their even been a single case of that yet?).

@_date: 2012-12-10 23:32:41
haha looks like I was a little hasty. Looking at yours and sgtspike's comments, I assumed that even with the efficiency increase, miner's fees might make it more expensive. But I guess we cannot know for sure (for some reason I thought sgtspike was saying that the fees alone would be 5-10%). I suppose the fees could be almost as low as the electricity cost, in which case bitcoin would be very competitive.
@_date: 2012-07-06 16:56:29
they take 0.4 percent of the trade from whoever fills the order, and they give 0.1 percent per trade to the order creator (bonus for adding liquidity to the market). this gives them a net rake 0.3 percent =)

I had 140 BTC on there.. fucking painful just thinking about it, I could have been paying down student loans but I wanted to make an investment in this technology that seemed so awesome.
I guess this is what I get for procrastinating with preparing a cold storage wallet and practice making sure I know how to use it.
I know everyone says oh bitcoin is so easy just take a little time. But ffs, it isn't that easy, I'm not afraid to say I'm an intelligent guy, but it takes a lot of time and energy to learn how to do everything just right with bitcoin.

You are being dishonest.

If you are in your young twenties, I can easily see putting 50% to 90% of your savings in BTC for a year or two (adjusting if the outlook changes, as necessary), as long as you have job security.

Dollar cost averaging ftw. Pick $X, and spend that much each month/week on bitcoin, regardless of price. This assumes you appreciate and value the fundamentals of the bitcoin protocol, and believe more and more others will as well.
Don't forget to lock them coins up tight also.

It's a shame that your argument is of such low-quality, because you happen to be on the correct side of the issue.
No one cares what you pick up off the ground, that has no relevancy. Fortunately, the new rule is simply a default in the reference client. It does not change network/protocol rules, so if a miner is willing to mine the low value transaction, it will be included regardless of the suggested "minimum".

Gold has value and no one buys pizza with gold. I think bitcoin can have value even if it is not massively used as a method of exchange. But I am no expert.
Edit: instead of downvotes, can you please explain why this may be wrong? I am genuinely curious. My rational is that something can be valuable as a store of value even if it isn't widely used as a method of exchange.
@_date: 2013-03-08 21:56:33
If I had to guess, I don't think the bitcoin economy is ready to support the 850k needed ~~monthly~~ (EDIT: quarterly) for bitcoinstore to stay afloat. I also don't believe we should try to fake it (buying shit that we don't need to reach the threshold).
This isn't to say that it is not a very worthy effort. I applaud everyone who contributes to strengthen the bitcoin network and economy. And hey, maybe I'm wrong. I wouldn't complain about that!
EDIT: Quarterly seems more reasonable, but time will tell. It is good to spread awareness, however I don't like the idea of promoting poor consumer behavior. We should be educating on how to save money and be a shrewd spender. Financial illiteracy/irresponsibility is one of the biggest problems for our economy/society today

To me it seems rather irrelevant that the "bad" data is encoded there. You have to take several purposeful steps to actually extract any special, additional meaning out of these transactions. For anyone who isn't looking for it, there is no impact.
Additionally, I like bitcoin because it doesn't censor. If we start censoring might be time to start looking for an alternative.

I read a convincing argument on one of the bitcointalk technical discussion threads that letting the miners pick the block size entirely by themselves would let a few large miners with really fast propagation time create extremely large blocks that the smaller miners would be unable to process in time (something to this effect), which would push the smaller miners out of the market and lead to more centralized mining.

Some people on the interwebz were saying they originally dropped support as they were too afraid of appearing fringe and losing cred with some of their DC friends. No idea if it's true, but it seems like a reasonable (and unfortunate) explanation.
The tone of this new article announcing bitcoin acceptance does seem off to me. They should stop pussy-footing around. Credit cards and paypal have "limitations" and "weaknesses" as well, yet they didn't write a fucking article lamenting their reluctance to accept those forms of payment because of it
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:41:50

@_date: 2013-07-16 08:19:01
Very nice piece. However, I do think the "correlation with other major financial assets" part is a bit of a stretch...
I also would have liked to see some discussion regarding the trends in number of users/transactions. It seems we are still stuck largely in speculation land. Although I have seen some reasonable arguments that bitcoin may first reach a very large market map due to investment/speculation and then eventually catch on as a payment system.

It'd be nice if they paid back the rest of the 25k coins they lost tho.

Unless there is a massive protocol failure or some other huge unforseen catastrophe, the 2.5 year bull run will continue. There may be large corrections at time (like the 90% correction of the first bubble). but the trend has been up up up for the past 2.5 years.
I have not seen any convincing arguments that explain why bitcoin will not be a success. It really is something new.

Greater than exponential increases rarely (or never?) sustain themselves

best of luck mate. a more positive, open-minded approach might serve you well in life.

dollar cost averaging is your best friend. additionally, dont be afraid to take some profits

dollar cost average and take your risk tolerance pills

I agree that liquidity is definitely an issue.
However, I would argue that anonymity is not the main benefit of Bitcoin. I think the ability to completely control your own wealth is more important. Even if the powers that be can figure out who is using bitcoin, if they can't control it or stop it, they are shit out of luck
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:49:09
fuck yeah
@_date: 2013-05-22 05:04:31
it's not the same. it requires an exponentially larger amount of investment/use, as the price movement you refer to is an exponential one
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:54:35
especially if an increase in size is because all the fuckers just wanna get rich. top quality posts, this brings.

hide yo kids, hide yo wife, they buying up all the coins in here!
     
    
but on a serious note, ~~tread~~trade cautiously my friends. BTC is a fucking wild ride.
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:31:03
Well it would simply be another tool available to BTC users. You could choose to only store a couple hundred dollars worth of coin on the card at any give time, and you could always choose to send coins to recipient via the network.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:12:49
Ah sorry, I wasn't 100% clear. I am not downloading the blockchain, I am simply created an address/privkey pair using a local copy of  You can then print out the private key and keep it safe somewhere (paper wallet style), or if you are using the brain wallet feature then just make sure to have a secure, memorize-able passphrase (not recommended for everyone). Then save the public address and use it to receive funds as a secure offline savings wallet.
I think you can also set up one of the alternative clients on your USB to create an offline wallet without downloading the blockchain (armory or multi-bit, I forget), but I don't know the details.

these are getting better and better! awesome song
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:50:09
Yeah, you are correct. this thread is kind of just for fun it seems.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:41:42
I sent some coins from coinbase the other day, and they took about 10-15  minutes to actual broadcast the actual transaction with my address as the receiving address. I think they have a bunch of internal shifting around of coins that occurs when a user sends coins.
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:00:19
I recommend the USB method. that way the OS-install on which you generate the new address never even has to touch the network. and once you get it installed on your USB stick it is pretty easy!
Now I have a question: Does anyone know if you there is any need to wipe the USB after use and re-install linux on it? Or can i continually use it?
@_date: 2013-05-05 23:06:50
what about the bitcoins stolen last summer? or would that have to be an entirely separate case?
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:14:51
it depends on your long term outlook. if it isn't positive, then you are either a day trader or acting somewhat silly by holding coins. the recent crash was entirely technical (we were massively overbought), no fundamental problems with bitcoin. my opinion is we will consolidate somewhere between $30 and $70 and then slowly begin increasing in value again, as the services/infrastructure continues to greatly improve.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:07:22
Because (I'm guessing) whollyhemp is a pretty small business so if 50 redditors purchase from there that will make a large impact. For large businesses that is negligible.
And what we really need is much stronger adoption by users (not speculation), salaries in bitcoin, etc. Which may come in time. A few large businesses accepting doesn't mean the bitcoin monetary base is now worth 10x more.

This is a shit post. This subreddit is turning into a fucking cult.
Here's an idea: stick to the facts. don't people how to behave.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:01:29
stop repeating bullshit. it annoys me.
@_date: 2013-08-15 08:09:25
I doubt your average reddit user affects the price too much. I see a lot of big buys moving the price mostly. That said, I will downvote with the fury of 1000 suns if I see the "bitcoin hold" meme.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:26:49
The thing is, during its short history, bitcoin has NOT seen much large, smart money yet. And if it is starting too, then his post would certainly be true.
But your words of caution should DEFINITELY be heeded. Take some profits DURING this rocket lauch, people. Don't wait for the end.
@_date: 2013-06-16 05:52:16
you guys are crowding the sub reddit with all the bitinstant bitching
@_date: 2013-02-17 18:14:38
looks they forgot a few unit tests... 
More seriously tho, this only reinforces the idea that until any external BTC service has proved itself over a few years, they shouldn't be trusted with more than a few bitcoins at a time. Make that offline savings wallet and send most of your bitcoins there.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:45:16
doesn't seem like she read the comment on the previous article (day 2) about bitfare.org. she can use that to pay for muni/bart =)
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:04:03
That's the plan. Also selling (or spending) some here and there won't hurt and seems wise

he knows more than most about general trends outside of bitcoin and the little he does know about bitcoin allows him to comment on bitcoin's position in a broader picture. it was a good interview IMO

While i think bitcoin is pretty awesome, we should remember it's not a silver bullet. Some of the items on the list would probably not change at all even if bitcoin was used very widely (corporate profits, banks committing fraud).

keep at least a few dozen coins, for the long haul!

25k coins were also stolen last summer from Bitfloor. Roman covered about 2% of this loss (albeit BTC was trading at a higher rate when he covered some of the loss).
