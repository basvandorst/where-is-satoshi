As far as I know, BitGo is a security layer, not a bank. If Bitfinex had their settings configured in a way that allowed this to happen, or allowed themselves internally to get away with the inside job and call it a "hack", then there's no way BitGo could have stopped it.

Are you fucking kidding me with this thread? Here's who founded BitGo:
Mike Belshe is a veteran technologist who invented the multi-signature protocols used at BitGo. Prior to BitGo, Mike worked at Google on the founding team of Google Chrome, was the co-inventor and driving force behind SPDY (which has now become HTTP/2.0), and co-founded Lookout Software, an email search company acquired by Microsoft. He holds a C.S. degree from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
Ben Davenport is a technology entrepreneur and investor who has been deeply involved with Bitcoin since mid-2011. Prior to BitGo, Ben co-founded Beluga, which was sold to Facebook in 2011 and became Facebook Messenger. Prior to Beluga, Ben worked in engineering at Google and Microsoft, and spent several years doing algorithmic trading at high-frequency firm Hudson River Trading. He holds CS degrees from Princeton and the University of Washington.
Now fuck if I know who owns the shady ass joke of a Bitcoinica clone exchange that is Bitfinex, but I have to laugh at all the fingerpointing at BitGo. 
"Waaaa waaaaa a company wants to make money and is filing patents, so I hate them for life waaaa" Give me a fucking break.

BitGo, the company owned by bonafide tech heavyweights from Google, Microsoft, etc., is 0% responsible. Bitfinex, the anonymous exchange that's basically a clone and was sitting on a huge pile of cash and could have easily decided "ok guys, now's the perfect time, what are our BitGo security settings so we could make transfers that won't be flagged", is 100% responsible. 
Or maybe they actually got "hacked", who knows.

I'll just use OP's reply to someone else a while back as a response to this thread:

I have an affiliate account with ClickBetter and don't remember the option of being paid affiliate commissions in bitcoin...did you mean they accept bitcoin from customers to buy products on their marketplace?

Like which ones?

Play both sides of a sports bet that takes place months down the line, and consider the vig a "savings fee".

What affiliate networks have adopted Bitcoin? I know MaxBounty is one, but haven't heard of any other reliable one.

Shift and Bitpay are the ones I use, Shift to spend direct from funds held in BTC, Bitpay card to load BTC and hold/spend in USD.

I agree, but even "evil" Chase recently suspended an account of mine temporarily after an attempted transfer to Coinbase of 25k. I called, they verified my identity, they asked me, "You know who Coinbase is?" I said yep, a trading exchange, so they're like "Oh ok, cool, do you plan on any future transfers", I said yes, they say ok great I'll clear them for future transfers, and boom that's it, 5 minute phone call and my account is cleared, money in Coinbase next day, and she offered to stay on the line to make sure I can log into my account and it shows as normal.
For all the shit we give banks, I've never had any bad experience or unreasonable delays with any. Wire transfers are wire transfers, unless there's a problem they will happen same day or next day, and if there is a problem, they will send you a text message, phone call w/voicemail, and freaking smoke signal if they could.

I plan to hodl, and am already hodling some in multibit + keepkey, but this is a withdrawal from a failed attempt to call the bottom of ETH.
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:03:11
Yes, I've never had a problem with withdrawals to crypto through them, both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the delay previously and this one have been withdrawals to USD, which makes me consider it might be the bank that they deal with (I believe it's Triumph Bank).

With a Bitcoin debit card, you get the best of both worlds.
