This may be possible. I'm just wondering if any companies are taking this into consideration as more BTC ATMs are coming to life.

This has been my luck lately, but I'm not the only one. I think we all have been watching the US go down hill in so many ways. 
You can go to college for 4 years &amp; find yourself working in retail just to make ends meet. The college loans you are trying to pay have interest rates that make the loans themselves seem impossible to pay back, while corporations are receiving bail outs from the government. We pay the most for healthcare &amp; on our military, yet there are so many sick, homeless, in debt... &amp; look how our vets are treated. 
People are really struggling.
I see bitcoin as a unifying symbol. A symbol of hope. 
I have almost nothing invested in it right now because I can't afford it, but every fraction that I plan to buy I feel will be more gratifying than any USD I receive for working my dead end job. To see so many people believing in a decentralized currency that could have so much potential is truly amazing.
Keep believing.

You can still buy and withdraw your BTC, but because you are not level 2 (assuming Coinbase) you won't be able to have "instant transaction". You may have to wait 30 days if this is your first purchase.

So if it's treated the same as gold, but it is not a currency in China how by *my logic* is bitcoin better than Yuan? I'm pretty sure you're eating the paint chips, kid.

New to btc, but I only see good things to come. Should of invested years ago...

When you went to buy, did they have a checkbox saying something along the lines of 
"Once your USD funds arrive, we will exchange them to bitcoin **at the market price** at approximately DAY DATE at TIME PST."
My problem right now with Coinbase is their arrival times are changing constantly, which isn't right... 
If you have a set time X day then on arrival day *it should be at X time*

Actually I'm very aware, but it seems like so many people here are covering for BTC. 


Is my response as well.

So with most of the BTC being made there &amp; government not allowing financial institutes to use how it was intended, how will it survive?

I can't wait until every news source stops using Silk Road as a synonym for Bitcoin

Noted. I'm talking specifically about a physical card though that can be slid or read (without a QR scanner).

Hmmm... I could of swore there were about a dozen posts saying how bitcoin was better than gold... now it *is* gold? I'm confused.
