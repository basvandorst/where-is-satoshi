No. I have realized, however, that my initial order at coinbase was still pending after 12+ hrs (50$). Still makes me think why it is transferred to two different accounts afterwards.
Hope to be the idiot that can learn a valuable lesson :)

same thing happened to me although with omniwallet and coinbase.
have it now but i am not sure what happened
have some addresses that are in my post about this. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:36:05
think i might invest in lambo then 
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:51:18
maybe this stretched currency and system
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:27:35
couple 100k probably. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:31:30
is your order still pending at coinbase?

this is what happened. I transferred btc to omniwallet from coinbase in order to buy maidsafecoins, which I did not do eventually. Then I wanted to transfer the btc back to coinbase. For that I copied my public key from coinbase and pasted it into omniwallet. (Not checking them manuall - definitely my fault). Then I checked with coinbase to see if it was going through, but it didn't. I checked for the validity of the receiving address on blocktrail, realizing that it arrived and soon later was transferred to two new addresses.
- Any tips for starting from now?  
I checked my system using avast and malwarebytes additionally i use a vpn client. 
Thank you!

maybe. but how do you know when? honestly it's your decision whether you go for it or not

you could have him find out the seed words of a trezor for a scavenger hunt or charades maybe
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:26:58
understood. never tried it!
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:15:16
i would say if you need to ask don't for now at least

Whenever an article stresses blockchain and not bitcoin I get slightly suspicious. 
Also why have an interdisciplinary approach with the university of business only?
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:00:02
I have recently installed one to keep me updated about cryptocurrency news and yes I do use this device to visit alt-coin sites and as general browsing tool.
Regarding storage however only in combination with trezor. And only small time buying as I currently have no other way around it. 
Thanks!!!

Thanks. I am doing that right now. Should I consider wiping my laptop clean?

thanks for sharing this!

if it is a new wallet you have to be verified first. it is on their site, if i remember correctly

i am not owning a bitfinex account, but from what i have read is that those are the futures after the fork.

be very careful not to give out any relevant information about you. probably best to delete this account as well. you can find a lot if useful information here and i would suggest spending time to read up on what you are not familiar with.
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:00:32
a month is a long time in crypto. you might want to keep updated more frequently

trezor works for me!

I thought you were arguing that the plot posted was linear although its exponential growth, therefore I pointed out that it uses a log scale..  
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:00:52
There is a FAQ thread right at the top of r/bitcoin. Just in case you have overlooked it. Lot's of useful information in there

Gladly. 
- transfer of btc from my coinbase account to an omnibase wallet. 
(Offer still pending after 12hrs)
- I transferred my btc from my omniwallet back to my coinbase account. (at omniwallet i have NOT exchanged them into any other cryptocurrency and decided to move them back)
- Therefore I opened my coinbase account using chrome and copied the address of my btc wallet and pasted it into the omniwallet.  
- I did not check the address (definitely my fault) and hit confirm
- I checked coinbase for verification of the transaction and saw nothing. Then I eventually compared the two addresses and realized that they are not the same. 
- After that I checked blocktrail..
 
omniwallet bitcoin address:
bitcoin address I have sent money to from omniwallet: 
1GmsL3pPKucD2mooshKDnMde8Ss8nZsCeL 
From there it was sent to two new bitcoin addresses IMO
I don't get why the offer is still pending and I simultaneously have this
I dont get why it is moved from (1GmsL3pPKucD2mooshKDnMde8Ss8nZsCeL) to two new addresses (18hABnGrh8iMxKpcNTkehk3wYEMU6ALcnx, 12njxpvRavFDDj1VSAgPPcY4z9eceyhfWU) afterwards.
Is it a security issue or am I interpreting it wrong?
Edit: it is back now from external bitcoin account
still no clue
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:02:19
you are doing quite the opposite actually. If you’re unsure about it it’s ok you can, as I said, look it up. But as a general rule of thumb it is better to be informed when informing others. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:44:16
not a chance man - look it up
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:51:56
no worries. enjoy
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:06:18
not sure if correct:
P(lottery)=(6/53)*(5/52)*(4/51)*(3/50)*(2/49)*(1/48)= 4.35*10^-8
P(more likely to win in the lottery)=P(lottery)/P(privatekey)=4.35*10^92 
Edit: assumin 50 characters for privatekey
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:38:43
that's why it is plotted on a log scale 
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:37:22
had a similar issue a couple days ago when i wanted to transfer btc from coinbase to another wallet.
Got my btc transferred back after transaction was cancelled.
