I think 0.8 is worth it to decentralize all the banks in the world. There’s also the chance we may have a completely different power source in 2yrs. You never know. ����‍♂️

Well maybe not you, but from someone who is more optimistic who wants to make the world a better place.

That’s a good point. However, by creating a new banking system many more different types of companies would likely get funded. That’s the whole point. We need a new system That’s more inclusive to different ideas and taking more chances. The important thing is creating growth. Decentralizing the banking system should create a wider range of new possibilities. New power sources included.

An optimist who has a background in science and QP that might be able to tap into new energy sources. Not me. Lol. But someone who can do it. I’m optimistic for a better future and would like to ensure that person is afforded the opportunity.

Assuming you already have a business or a house with equity to use as collateral. Someone who simply has a good idea and even the background to start a business can not get a business loan. In addition, it’s harder establish a security or lines of credit for young entrepreneurs coming out of college with mounting student loans, inflated housing costs, and expensive health insurance.

Decentralization. In other words... there’s not one person or entity making the decision.
