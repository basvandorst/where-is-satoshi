Awesome! Is there anyway to add this to the sidebar, or perhaps stick it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:52:15
According to this logic it should hit exactly $1837.28 on Friday the 13th.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:38:05
But they do charge a slight premium FYI
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:03:33
Everything is speculation. No matter what happens, nobody knows what's going to happen in the future. 
I personally think there is a bubble at the current moment due to the influx of people who blindly threw their money at bitcoin the moment they heard of the huge returns due to the extensive coverage by many news outlets.
I think that once the coverage of bitcoin dies down a little, the price will probably dip slightly due to a selloff from these folks, but I'm pretty confident it will continue upwards for a long time due to its potential.

Where were you yesterday? The price dropped to $750-ish at it's lowest before rebounding!
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:33:12
How is it? I'm thinking about getting one for college!

Buy! Just because people are selling doesn't mean all hope is lost! Stick with your gut feeling, and mine is telling me to buy.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:51:43
This is a good idea!
Perhaps we should tweet them collectively, it's worked in the past.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:15:20
I prefer the SMS code
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:20:48
Is this legit?
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:45:17
How is buying in at $30 bad...?
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:03:22
I'm not fully aware of the process, but how long have you held the BTC?
If you've held them for more than a period of 1 year, you're eligible for the 15% long-term gain tax, which is lower than short-term one.
Sorry that I can't help much more, but good luck!

The late 2013 version?

Hindsight is 20/20
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:57:06
I hope you aren't looking to invest in Altcoins, since due to the recent success of bitcoins many are being manipulated in elaborate pump-and-dump schemes. Stay safe!
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:00:50
I think my brain just exploded :/
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:55:11
Keep in mind that it can take quite a while for the whole transaction to take place, and prices will fluctuate during then.
Back when the price crossed $1000, people bought from Coinbase only to find out the price was at $1200 by the time the transaction went through.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:26:36
How do you plan to buy? Coinbase? MtGox? Localbitcoins? As far as I know, you can't buy BTC with credit cards.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:17:33
Anyone know if this site is legit?
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:44:36
Interesting, thanks for correcting me.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:40:57
We could just direct them to @_date: 2013-12-01 18:37:12
I'm the opposite, I waited too long to get into bitcoin :/
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:51:31
Hopefully major businesses give in to all this peer pressure to accept Bitcoin, we have to keep it up!
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:32:42
Did I arrive too late?
edit: Thanks OP!
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:00:54
I think a large majority of the mid-sized holders are dumping a portion of their holdings to cover their initial investment. I believe that they haven't cashed out sooner because they too believe in the enormous potential of bitcoin but still want to be safe by covering their initial buy-in in case something goes disastrously wrong.

Excellent review, very very helpful! So you don't have issues with the weight when you're carrying it between classes?
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:58:14
If you do it through an exchange such as Coinbase or MtGox, you'll have to pay capital gains tax which is currently 15% (providing you've held BTC for 1+ years making it a long-term gain).
If you want to be slightly shadier and try to evade the aforementioned tax, you could always sell at a slower pace through Localbitcoins.com for cash.
Good luck, and great find!
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:49:37
I guess, but I'm sure your professor/classmates would find it really cool that you took the time to do a demonstration. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:42:41
It would be best if you ignored this troll

How does this tipping thing work?

Your order will be canceled.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:52:55
Unlucky man, sorry to hear :/
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:42:56
It's not worth it unless you have free electricity
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:29:47
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:21:51
It's not really worth it unless you have free electricity, which is probably not the case.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:12:24
Nobody can predict the future, but hopefully!
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:44:18
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:20:07
Yes. But if you're 14, how are you going to purchase them if you can't link a bank account?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:41:02
On a side note, how long does it take to have your bank account verified on Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:23:20
Oh they'll link their account? Or your account?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:56:10
Which one? The one where you link your phone 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:35:03
Excuse my ignorance, but what is "fiat"? I've seen it all over here and I'm utterly lost :(
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:35:39
That's the same situation I'm in...I'm too young to link a bank account so my only options are Localbitcoin.com with cash OR PayPal, both which are sketchy :/
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:09:33
At this point mining is almost pointless unless you have a free source of electricity. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:32:08
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:30:59
You could always give them $0.50 worth each or something, just an idea!
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:08:29
The donations part kinda killed it...
But nevertheless, good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:24:17
Just did some looking, and it's fake...
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:48:34
Alright thank you very much! Seemed a little too good to be true, but wanted to double check.
I deleted it now, just to prevent innocent redditors from going there. Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:34:17
Do you have any BTC stored on your wallet there? If so, MOVE IT ASAP.
