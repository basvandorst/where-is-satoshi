This is dumb unless you want a "new" corporation buying their assets / customers / IP and starting over under a new name

He's not going to respond here either 
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:54:17
Why should shareholders have to talk to your asses? We've already made losses on this shitshow

What a joke
The tokens are equity equivalents for regulatory purposes and options granted for accounting purposes .

What a joke

This guy didn't get ducked. You're probably full of shit/lying to try and pretend you shouldn't have either.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:31:16
I'll buy them
@_date: 2016-08-29 13:00:28
Now you guys kith
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:41:00
Decisions like hard forking?
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:20:38
Why would you have 700 btc in a hot wallet? You deserved to lose it
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:51:30
My name is not relevant 
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:13:36
*takes out popcorn*
I'll wait to see you get your response 
Shouldn't have had more money than you can afford to lose in btc
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:36:36
You'd rather profit minded unaccountable companies be doing it as opposed to elected officials? Neither is good but the former is much worse.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:05:51
You're accepting the haircut regardless 
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:20:29
No 
That's idiotic no investor would ever go in on that
@_date: 2016-08-25 20:49:37
Yeah because bitcoins have never been stolen
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:25:27
They can take the Monopoly money because it's not real
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:23:00
I have 100% of the Bitcoin I had a month ago. That extra 33% cares.
I'll give you $5 for all of the invented crypto they gave you 
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:28:08
Please establish who you are and I will be happy to
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:19:02
Theres a reason you have 0 points and I don't nub
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:34:37
Don't point out others flaws while displaying your own 
Hold yourself to the same standards to which you hold others 
Ad hominems only make clear your own weaknesses
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:00:13
I meant on his post. An idiot could figure out he doesn't have 0 points on his account
@_date: 2017-01-27 01:50:14
Needham is not "big time" at all
That said they are right
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:48:18
I don't care enough to demonstrate to you why you are wrong
Everyone on the block had a hand in that
@_date: 2017-01-31 21:16:15
What a scam. I've used rideconnect and been cheated, was a horrible experience. 
Check out my upcoming blog  (link will be alive in a week)
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:44:51
Bulge bracket or high end boutique is big time
Those in the industry know who is and who isn't. There is noone I know who would consider Needham anything but a third rate player

You're showing your unintelligence, you should adapt instead of adopting
