** And are there any risks of using both coinid or xapwallet (missing a letter from keyboard and I copied over it so x will do lol) that involve losing the money?

oeople mentioned it here i think its a script or something you run through python, it doesnt seem to want to get confirmed no matter what I set the fee to why might that be?

Wow they both now say low fee and I haven't done anything, they said unconfirmed at first and without refunding have changed to low, I set both fee up to one before max fee what's happening with that?

I think I see my problem.. dynamic fee off is a much lower fee than on, I had dynamic on one wallet though and both are low.. how lol?

I'm only transferring £16 and £12 from 2 different electrum wallets, I don't have dynamic fees set on does that make a difference?
I put my fee up full and in writing it said the fee was 1000 per 10 blocks and it refunded me I then put it to 900 to 25 for the £16 and for the £12 it was a much lower number, only one digit thi time but I put it up full to make sure it sent not caring about the fee and it did the same, could there be something wrong with my wallet I can fix?
really not understanding the fees or why it failed, as for urgency I wanted it about 5 days ago.. do you think I should try a different a block explorer? If so It must be as anonymous as blockchain for using with tor

No need for specifics, a noob needs no shunning for seeking help, only assistance :) 
Not sure why I said block chain but I'm sure you understood me, how do I sell Bitcoin for cash could you tell me?
