Coming from and have not personally invested in Bitcoin but there is one key issue with how to laid this out and that is the missing the point the in the most of the developed world, computing power is a very real resource that drives many of the luxuries we do.
While (at least as far as I know) the algorithms it does are mostly pointless it is more of building up an environment that one day they can be not useless. What if (trying to do ELI5 example) they helped handle the server load YouTube uses for organizing videos. That is something that they already legitimately pay money for by having to build and power servers to do.
The idea at it's "core" makes sense in that computing power and algorithm solving is a "valuable" resource in modern world and how the system is scaled and designed ensures the basic functioning of a currency. Just the adoption of this by any wide spread metric is still FAR OFF, and personally likely not even for decades.
Edit: Also on how fast it has grown. While it is a massive jump and there are a LOT of caveats to those stories that "pluff" these stories it is key to also look at it from if you invest in a company or tech RIGHT before they took off. If you invested a bit of money into smart phone devices, software tools, etc in 2004/2005 you would be insanely rich today. Take Apple for example which had stock prices at $2 a share in early 2004 that is now worth $175 a share today and Apple was still "big" in 2004. Now imagine people more in the know and ground floor who can invest even earlier to get major payoffs. I wouldn't read into those stories no more than friends of major CEO's who got rich by knowing them and pulling small favors when they where small.
