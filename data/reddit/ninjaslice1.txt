What’s the Dash/Putin factor?

You’re right it does sound like a Ponzi but that’s not how I meant it.. I just think the BTC community should be more connected and help to maintain a strong price. 100k is extreme but that is just to get people’s attention. The point is that we should have faith in BTC being worth more than the current price and not to lower the sell price in order to panic sell. We can control the BTC price up to a certain extent.

Fair enough, but I would imagine there are quite a few people that would love to see the price of BTC at 100k

I see your point of view but I didn’t mean it to come across like that. I just think we should be able to control the bottom price of BTC a bit more so people don’t have to panic sell. If we are all more social and connected in the BTC community then surely it can have a more positive outcome on price and increase the belief in BTC and blockchain.

Take what you will from my advice.. many people trade BTC, if you hadn’t noticed, so they are already taking that risk regardless. Hodlers can keep hodling because that’s great for BTC too, I’m just suggesting people set higher sell orders. I was exaggerating when I said 100k, I’m just trying to make a point to not sell for such cheap prices.

True, but we could at least help the panic sellers from lowering the price below current levels and encourage them to increase the price of their sell orders. If we call a minimum of 6k for the rest of the month then that would be a start and hopefully we can move up from there and perhaps a bull run could develop from that in 2019. I just think it’s a good idea to have the BtC community more social and interactive with price goals in mind too.

Fair enough, but I still feel the current price is too low so setting higher selling prices on exchanges would help to raise the price up a bit.. Would be nice if we didn’t have so many panic sellers.

Lol exactly!
