Coinbase is giving into Fed , Circle is the Fed's experiment with Bitcoin...monitoring how users handle Bitcoin. Hence the FDIC insured. Circle is far more profesional company as they are a financial instituition and Coinbase is an exchange. The SEC wants to control it.

Circle doesn't have any fees. They charge a premium through the price you buy it for. Another benefit of Circle is the price is the same whether it is buy or sell. Best place to sell if you can and have enough on your limits. They just lifted my sell limits but have kept my buy limits the same. Very satisfied with Circle and it is much, much better than Coinbase.

Actually Coinbase is not a financial institution that is why they cannot operate in certain states. Circle is.

i reside in a state that wont allow Coinbase. Love Circle (only FDIC insured exchange, more on that in the right thread) have awesome instant buy limits and no send limits...nevertheless you got to have the Trezor. everyone wants your coins and its BTC security at its finest. Worth every mBTC.

I have used both and find Circle is easier to use. I have used Circle enough that I have 3,000 instant buy per 7 rolling days with no sending limits now. To me, using Circle is just like going to any store and buying a loaf of bread.

A Trezor solves that problem. I feel better having my BTC right next to me. JMHO.

Ironically, Bitfinex just started to move the market as soon as this thread made the Blockchain.info headlines. Bitstamp used to always be lower than Bitfinex. Now they are sanctioned by the EU and have become the leader with outrageous spreads. Reminds me of the dot.com stock trading in the early 2000's. I figured the exchanges are filling their own warchests. When the market shows downtrend and should move up, the spread should be tight Look at Bitstamp now , well over a $1.00 spread.

Read this article about RSI.   The 1 hr chart on both exchanges showan RSI over 30 which is bullish which translates into an uptrend...18 hrs in oversold...you make the call.

Next time it drops $30+ watch the patterns afterwards and ask yourself did everyone just give up an lose interest. anyways this wan't meant to be an argument. Just my observation. the 2h and 1 hr are going bullish with the 4hr following in about 2 as it begins uptrend. These are my observations, appreciate your feedback.

By law when you purchase an item from an estate sale, you purchased the item with an "as is " warranty. You are not legally bound to return the cryptopcurrency to the estate as the computer is considered liquidated. If you feel a sense of moral obligation to inform the trustee of the estate, feel free to do so. Due to the fact that it is cryptocurrency, it may never be returned to heirs of the estate. 
In comparison, let's say you went to a garage sale of a family that is moving and you do not know where to find them but bought a piece of jewelry that turns out to be worth more than the $10 you spent on it, you are not liable to return it. That BTC is yours. Ever watch Antique Roadshow? Many people have bought someone else' junk only to be their "treasure' just like you and have reaped the reward of good fortune. Buy something nice with it.

Not losing and i am not insulted by any means.  I read it right now that there should be not a quick dramatic climb but it shouldn't lay flat that long and should be rising to the resistance/support level of 452 then 460. almost 460 yesterday then it collapsed, there were enough buyers.
