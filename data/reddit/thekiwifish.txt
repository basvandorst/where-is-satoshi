Gold &amp; Silver are a store of value. An investment pays you something for holding it. As for being able to buy stuff on APMEX.... unless something is priced in Bitcoin, so what. I don't know about them but I bet they give you a quote at the time of purchase, and a time limit to finish the transaction. So they are accepting bitcoin and then converting it into their local currency asap. That leads no additional legitimacy to Bitcoin.

But you could just as easily have lost $60. If you had some stock, you would keep your capital, and receive a dividend.

However both Gold and Silver are not great investments as they don't provide a return for just holding them and, like Bitcoin, are speculative. Buffett wouldn't invest in Gold, Silver or Bitcoin.

To add to that, if you are buying gold that is also not investing. It is speculating. You are speculating that the price of gold will be going up (like you are with bitcoin....). Gold also doesn't provide a return when holding it.

And just because he doesn't invest in something doesn't mean he doesn't understand it. He may understand it very well and based on his risk appetite, realise it's a bad "investment". (I say "investment" because it's all speculative, and not investing when it comes to Bitcoin).

What most people who are "invested" and into bitcoin fail to see, is the risk associated with the rapid increase in price. Once you take risk into account, it changes the way things look a lot. If you own bitcoin, you have to ask yourself "Would it be okay if the price dropped by 50% tomorrow?". If you can't stomach that - get out now.

My bogeys are a lot like bitcoin (limited supply, divisible) but without the electricity consumption. If my bogeys have massive adoption, it may be worth much more than a company.

I'd take that over bitcoin

Sure, but over the medium term and index fund won't fall. And it provides a return.

You can buy gold that is held by an agent. Transaction times are quicker too.

"It's digital gold" they say. While they would also never store their capital in gold....

The pool of holders doesn't really impact the price as much as the pool of people wanting to buy do.

The private member's clubs are full of people who sold too early, but not of those who sold too late.

TL;DR - Time in the market, not timing the market, is important.

It's not a great long term investment really, it's not a productive asset, just a medium of exchange similar to Zimbabwe dollars (but yes it's digital, less able to be facked, no inflation etc,). Yes, it might (and probably will) go up in value, but it might also go down.
