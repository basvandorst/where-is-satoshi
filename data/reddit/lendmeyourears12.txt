in my country if you live reasonably close to even a small town you will get at least 50mbps. I work for an ISP and thanks to some government incentives we have customers who have gone from having 1-2mbps for the last 10 years to 1gbps. even in some remote areas. eventually all copper will be replaced with fibre

your not thinking long term. 5 - 10 years from now we will all have 1gbps fibre links and all our data will be stored on the "cloud"

* use an ubuntu live cd
* disconnect all other network device in case of a MITM attack (super unlikely)
* create a hardware wallet and dump all your bitcoins 
* put wallet file onto a usb (make sure its encrypted )
* print out the seed (you could even encrypt this)
* put usb and seed into fire proof safe
