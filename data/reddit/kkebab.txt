At this time last year the total market cap was roughly 20-30bn and really didnt pick up until the end of Q4. Could the worst be still to come...?

Personally I bought a brand new laptop specifically for trading and never log into exchanges on my mobile phone ever. But that's just me..

Assuming you live in the US? Any one know if this is the same in AUS

When you say you can't cash out to a bank do you mean only if i dont declare my wallet. Or, can't cash out into a bank full stop? I thought I could simply send back any profit i make

It's ironic, because of news like this I have been unwilling to return any of my profits back to my bank account. Moves like this just dig their Graves deeper.

Im sorry, i dont understand, how is getting rid of a big part at a low, a good thing?

Thats why you need to stay on your game

You need to think more long term. Of course the people who pushed it to 20k will be back. Look at dotcoms now. Do you think that cryprocurrencies are going to dissappear? If so why and if not, are we going to stay at sub 300bn market cap forever ?

Drops every day

You think people who were in before this year are going to start leaving the arena? Fat chance

Feels too quick. But 8k - 19k took only a couple of weeks iirc
