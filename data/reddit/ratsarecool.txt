Lmao ETH is dropping like fuck too *cries*

Thank you so much, I think this is the best unbiased ELI5 I’ve read on the two!

Can you get me the lottery numbers too while you’re at it?

Forgot to mention ETH, I have the same amount
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:17:02
Nope only BTC
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:15:44
I hope it’s not too much to ask, sorry for being a noob to this shit but...The block size debate...Is that going over whether theirs a limited amount of bitcoin or not? And Segwit...From what I’ve read it seems like it’s a thing that makes transaction fees much less?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:23:46
But like...Why do we want to split things up? Isn’t that just making each thing less then having a coin we could all rely on?

I did check the sub out but honestly it seems like both subs just despise each other and I haven’t really...Seen a reason yet?

But does a commodity not only have as much use as we give it? Obviously people have been giving this commodity some worth considering how much you can convert it back into Fiat currencies 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:11:00
But like...How is it a scam? To me it just seems like another Alt coin...
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:34:25
Hmm I guess I prefer bitcoin, I think of it most similar to a stock then an actual way of paying for things...
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:27:29
So Why are the BTC developers so adamant on keeping it to a 1MB block size? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:29:54
Well out of the two I meant, I have about 60% in BTC and 40% in etherium
