You make that sound like its a good thing? Most markets rely on a critical mass of users to give value. Its critical mass that makes thibgs like facebook valuable and google circles worthless.
Remove all the small people and all thats left is a heap of millionaires trading. 
All the small fish will move on and in turn give another coin value. At the end of the day theirs more small fish in the sea than large.

It can also be seen as a loss leader to acquire customer's. Preferably ones with larger balances that they can leverage out to loans. If your not one of the top banks its just another service you can offer that majors cant or wont.
I would change banks for that. But here in aus banks are still very anti bitcoin in the shadows. Not specifically saying no, but there has been alot of btc related account closures that just say "soz your accounts closed, heres a copy of our tos. No, we wont say why. Bye." so a bank that openly embrases it and makes managing, off/onramping fiat to crypto would have 100% of my business on day 1.

Couple years. But the first network nodes cost in the hundred of thousands. Then it was about 80k ea around the 100 mark and then droped to 30-40k each. 
I forget the exact model of computers used but they were all mainframes that took up trucks. Had to have rooms built to spec and have highly skilled people  to install and mantain them. Each one taking weeks to months to setup and sometimes years to get funding/negotiating. Hence not exactly a linnera comparison.

How's that working out for you?
I've thought about doing the same
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:49:45
Completely agree. Even with 0cent transaction fees ita still useless. Imagine going to pay for groceries only to find out your $100 pay check you were about to use to buy $100 worth of food is now worth $98. So get your card declined and have to put back an item, get to the car and now it would have been worth $102. 
Youd end up with dickheads holding up the line waiting for btc to go up a few dollars so they can afford whatever their buying 
Even "virtual cash" is no diffrent. In an ideal world it would opperate the same as curent fiat. $1 today is equal to $1 next week. The virtual cash part would come in in the forum of the blockchain. Whick would take place behind the sceens between the merchant and your card issuer. At wich point you simply have a debit card that takes 30mintes for the merchant to get paid (better then the 1-3day settlement times for credit cards today, but as a consumer who cares. Thats the merchants problem) even if its decentralized exchanges opperate as banks. If you cant trust banks why trust some random unregulated wild west exchange. Storing btc on a hardware wallet is no diffrent then storing cash under your bed. Except that its easier to hide and transport accross borders.
Imo its going to be the underlying tech that companies will implement into their own products and profit from. 
All that being said. I doubt coins are going anywhere especially btc and yes i do own a bit of btc.

IMO. I doubt he is satoshi. History is littered with inventors who were scooped by simply being to eairly, misunderstood, not being able to execute etc. Quite offten major inventions/game changing tech isnt credited to the person who first proposed it, but to the one who brought it to mass market. Often those people are building on the work of the original inventors.
Imo, satoshi was someone particularly skilled in the computer science/tech field who has seen the train wreck that is computer security, was aware of the govements treatment of fringe computer "hackers" and was scared of being lumped in with them. Who just so happened to come across nicks paper and had a "holy shit. Eurreka moment" being in that industry with the skills to not only understand exactly what it was he was reading but able to see the impact it could have. Id wager he spent months unable to sleep thinking about it, made some changes and decided to play with the idea then implemented his versions.

Some of these guys are spending 10s or even 100s of thousands upfront on hardware and that again in electricity. Plus time, rent, other expenses etc. That money has to come from somewhere.

Imo it depends what your "stack" is and how much it means to you. Personally my stack is around 1-2k and i always trade 100% at a 5x leverage. Which to some people is alot and stupid, to some its sweet fuck all. That said im perfectly willing to lose it as it was money i didnt initally earn and wont effect me financially if i lose it. 
mentally ive already written it off as the cost of a learning curve and probably the cheapest piece of education i will ever receive. For reals, a preschool education is worth more than "my stack" and I've learnt a crap tonne since. So i won't invest more till that stack is worth alot more, or i know more.

Their basically a bank without any of the banking systems regulations/oversights with a monopoly and very low morals.

True. But i think alot of the linked moves have more to do with bots than big whales. Since so many are linked to btc and btc to usd/t the bots can move btc to alt. Alt to usd/t. Usd/t to btc and level the market. A bot can do that 3-5times a second. Fund it with $500 and it can move 90k-150k a minute per coin (or 270-450k total volume per min) so any crazy spike in one coin quickly gets circled till its level. It looks like a whale buying 450k in a minute but realy its 1 bot making 10cents a circle.

You sell coins you dont actually own YET. Using your float as the collateral. Eventually you have to buy them back. 
Margin trading is where you take a loan for a multiple of your float. If the price rises or drops above the point where loss's exceeds the value of your float your forced to buy/sell what your holding so the person/broker you borrowed from isnt going to lose money.

There still tied up in legal crap for a couple more years. I suspect we wont see them come into play till after everyones been repaid. Which is a slow and long process.
He can also do 1 of 2 things with them. Keep them and sell for his own profit. In which case he will crash the market unless he goes off chain. Or redistribute some or most back to their original owners in which case it may somewhat crash (bassed on assumption owners will sell )or be a slow bleed as some of the old owners sell and some hold but then will stabilize and head back up. Assuming he doesnt redistribute during a crash or crazy December peak when it can compound, announces his plans clearly, loudly with enough advance notice and  does it over a period of a few months it shouldn't be TO bad.
I doubt he will keep them all. He's already pretty hated and if i were him id be fearing for my safety. Especially if i were keeping them. Best way is to redistribute 3-4x the original value and be like "yeah i fucked up. But look, you still made 3x roi when every other solid investment in that timeframe made 1-2x im trying to fix it" that would help ease the sting for most people and still leave him a 10x millionaire.

It was up about 1% 5 hours before the spike, then  droped about 3% in a couple minutes and recovered back to about 1% over an hour. Then steady for about 4 hours before boom. All with fuck all volume.
1 person buying the initial few hundred when theirs no volume pushed it up. Im assuming 500 people didnt spontaneously decied to buy all at the same exact minute.

Isn't syncing markets and arbitrage the same thing? Unless he's pushing for a single company/echange to have a global monopoly then imo multiple exchanges like we have now is the best. Stops any one from dominating or crashing the price like mt gox. Also btc regulations in different countries is a bitch.
A year ago there was massive price differences but recently arbitrage has been pretty dam tight between exchanges and trading pairs. Pretty much syncing the market.

Coinjars fine but i recommend btcmarkets. You just have to compare spot price and fees. Aus usually has a slight premium over us markets. In dec it was upto a 2.5k or 10-15% difference at times, so 400 isnt to bad. 
Also coinbase charge like 5% fees on credit card. So its probably more expensive.
Coinjars not to bad. I like their btc debit card idea, but im yet to fork out the $20 or whatever it is to use it. They had some problems eairly this year with deposits, but most exchanges have that issue at some point. I got an email saying it was resolved but havent used them since, so it should be ok. 
Every single exchange thats ever existed will have someone here on redit starting a thread freaking out that the exchange has taken 72hours longer then expected to credit/deposit their entier $5,000 worth of life savings. Claming its a scam etc. 
Acx.io is also ok. But they have low liquidity and now charge a flat $20 withdrawal fee. Which means if your withdrawing $100 you pay a 20%fee $1000 %2, 2k 1%. Break evens probably about 3k before their fees are equal to others..
I dont remember what it was like to get verified. though i do know it was a complete whore on most of these sites. Like "write a secred code on a piece of paper and take a selfie while holding your ID" Yeah i can totaly see my bank making selfies a requirement and verification didnt feel even slightly scammy. But i think most are like that, which is nuts and will stop shit tones of people signing up. I know my mums not taking a selfie while holding a prisoner mug shot style number under her face, and shes the kinda people who actually have the money to invest.
 But now im ranting. So tl;dr use btc markets. Sign up to everyone incase one is cheaper. Compare spot prices. Dont day trade on aus exchanges due to crazy fees.
