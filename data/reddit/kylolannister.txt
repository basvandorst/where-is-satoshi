Bitcoin is not asking for permission.

Or you could just not be a douche and advise people keeping currency on an exchange.

When will people realize you can’t fucking ban/outlaw/stop bitcoin?  This blows my mind.

This isn’t about winning an argument. I could give a fuck less about semantics. If you want to tell people coinbase’s crypto is insured because of one sentence on their page I’m going to say bullshit and tell you all to fuck off.   I’m not saying don’t use coinbase. I’m saying don’t blindly store crypto  there cause some neck beard read their support page.  Also eat my ass.

@_date: 2017-12-20 22:10:29
Okay you’re going to take it on good faith they’re insured from one sentence from coinbase? What’s their insurance policy? Who insured them? To say they’re insured is strongly implying fdic backing which is grossly misleading to a US citizen.

The amount of people being pro storing on coinbase is unreal on this sub today. I get it bcash has a coinbase boner today but you can be be pro coinbase and still not store crypto there. What is wrong with people?

Bcash shills all up in this post. Just don’t hold crypto on exchanges you cunts. If you have only 100s, yeah it’s dumb to xfer btc. If you have bcash xfer out with your low fees. Coinbase is great but you don’t have to suck their dick. Exchanges are fucking banks, white paper etc etc.

Why are you trying to ban the internet? The only way they can do that is to remove all the cell phone towers all over the world. No one wants to do that. How many have you personally taken down?

@_date: 2017-12-13 17:39:07
This is common with coinbase. Takes time for your bank to clear. Your price is locked in from the moment you hit buy. All standard my man.

Yeah coinbase sucks compared to owning your own keys but I would hate to see you deposit 50$ lose 3 on transaction, lose another couple bucks moving it out. Build up some money and then move it. I can’t say what the right threshold is that’s up to you. Just wanted to give you a heads up. Hodl!
