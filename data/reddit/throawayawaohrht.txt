Awesome, thanks! There it is! :)

Ok, so what info does the smartphone wallet hold? I'm sure I wouldn't want my private key anywhere on my phone. That seems like the most insecure place to have it.

Ah ok! Thank you so much :)

Sounds easy enough. I suppose I could just transfer them from one paper wallet to another.

I've been advised against using TOR unless I'm visiting .onion sites. Do you think bitcoin wallets should be set up in TOR?

I see. And how much personal info does LBC require? I'd like to maintain my anonymity.

Woot woot!! Thanks!! :D
Only .98 to go!

Oh geez, the more I learn, the more I realize I don't know lol. I understood everything up until the part about confirmations. Doesn't the transaction pop up on the blockchain as soon as the seller transfers the bitcoins to my wallet? At that point, I assumed it would be safe to hand over the cash. No? What are the multiple confirmations?

If we meet somewhere with free wifi (Starbucks for example), do I need to worry about the seller "controlling" the connection?

I appreciate the response. What exactly is a watch only wallet?

How mysterious. Thanks for all your help IronVape…made my night! :)

What's Satoshi's address?

So you're saying I need to have the bitcoins deposited into a LBC wallet first? Why not straight into my own paper wallet?

Creating the wallet seems to be the easy part. It's actually putting money into it that I'm a bit iffy about…and I considered practicing with coinbase, but I'd really prefer to keep my personal info personal.
