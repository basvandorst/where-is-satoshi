Yea.. exactly what I thought but was unsure.. I`m not taking that route.. Just started trying to wrap my head around the whole bitcoin deal and I knew that looked sketchy as hell.. I mean I could of made that post and I never ordered one through Butterfly..  Sadly it looks like most of them could be highly fake other than the normal people asking to pay through PP.. Thats one small reason I could see things fucking up in the long run for exchanges; via goods for BTC, when not making a transaction face to face.  But thank you for taking your time to honestly  answer this question.

Thanks I'll check it out. I saw this in a post somewhere and what you said makes sense.. 
"You guys are just giving BFL a free loan to make money. They have not got﻿ the hardware - There is zero point in making the hardware. If I got a free loan of millions of dollars on a vague perception of some great hardware being produced you would use that money to mine with standard GPU rigs, or put it on the stock market. When someone asks for their money back, no big deal, that person just loaned BFL $1200 to make money with for 6 months. In 6 months that $1200 was probably turned into $12000"
I figure few will actually own an ASIC and that BFL will actually be that few. Why put a product out that will essentially make things harder on yourself to constantly upgrade? The public would have to keep upgrading but why put the money back in BFLs hands when they cant even deliver the product.. If they do I dont see GPU rigs I see a warehouse full of ASICs.. at which point it will force the lower powered people out and you will have a majority of the mining in a very low amount of people, unless of course they try and keep up..

Up waayy too long testing the waters of this bitcoin pool... Just started this at the beginning of the drop (last night).. never invested though.. And I am doubting it hence the post.

But the TOS could not protect anyone that stupidly handed over BC-176.10.. like what could one do after that happens.. My thought is absolutely nothing.
