You have no idea if this is low or not. This could just be the start of it.

You can buy less than one bitcoin. Why are they not spending $1k to buy 1/10th of a bitcoin right now?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:04:21
Why? What makes you feel like $1k per bitcoin is a low price?
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:08:07
No, you're not. You said $1k is not likely because people who would like 1 bitcoin can afford to pay $1k, but you still haven't answered *why* they would want one bitcoin. You said it's because they want exposure to a world-changing asset/currency/technology, but they can *already* get that exposure, so who are all these people who would jump on it when it gets down to $1k per bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:50:17
And you think the looks of awe are because of the fact that you own more than one bitcoin and not because of what one bitcoin is currently valued at?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:42:23
I find it really strange that people would like to own exactly one bitcoin. I just don't see any reason for it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:39:59


Who are these people and why do they want 1 bitcoin? My own experience of this market is that most people who want bitcoins right now only want them because they believe it will be worth more in the future, are you telling me that there are 21 million people who would pay $1k simply to be able to say they own one bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:42:52
I don't really understand why someone would want to buy exactly a whole bitcoin. Maybe they do, and I'm just out of touch, but I don't see any reason why.

Most of Apple's cash is overseas. They have a hard time getting it into the US without getting hit by massive taxes, so it's very hard for them to do anything with it. Despite all the cash Apple also has a lot of debt. Besides, I'm not sure you could classify Apple as an aggressive growth company.

All bubbles has their ups and downs. Look at the dot-com bubble for example. It had several smaller crashes before it crashed for real. 
But I agree, Bitcoin is definitely an interesting one. Both economically and psychologically as well as a good example in how marketing works. I've been following it for quite some time now and what has baffled me the most is how absolutely no one seems to know why they're buying. Even those who seems to know a bit about Bitcoin ultimately doesn't have any reasons for their valuations when you press them a bit on the subject -- most simply shows a chart of previous performance and uses that as a reason for the future performance of the price, which is obviously completely insane. Right now it seems to have just been hype pushing the price up, which generates more hype which means more people want in which pushes the price even more up etc. But it looks like Bitcoin is now starting to run out of new buyers and thus new money. It will be very interesting to see how this will turn out.

What makes you think this is a bear trap?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:15:29
Are you talking about the fees tripling the cost? Otherwise your comment makes no sense. It doesn't matter what currency you use to buy the coffee with, the cost is an opportunity cost, which would be the same no matter what currency you use. 
So you have two options: buy your coffee in bitcoin or in USD. If you buy it in bitcoin then you lost x bitcoin. If you buy it in USD you lost y USD. If you bought it with USD you could have used those y USD to buy x bitcoin instead. This means the end result is the same; it cost you x bitcoin to buy that cup of coffee. 
Besides, with your logic there would be no reason to buy anything again ever. Why would you spend USD for a cup of coffee when you could instead exchange it for BTC and get 3x the amount in a short period of time? 
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:24:40
Lmao. Why would anyone trade this? Bitcoin really is doomed
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:55:11
So I assumed your graph was a graph over Bitcoin. If it was of some other shitcoin then it was completely irrelevant.

A slippage of $1000 or 17% lower price?
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:24:36
That's not how exchanges work. They won't sell your btc at $1 just because you accidentally typed that. Any exchange that did that would quickly go out of business.
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:03:28
This thread is about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:43:30
Lol. Good luck mate
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:44:06
My point was it will sell it at the highest bid offer. The exchange doesn't give a fuck that you want to sell it for $1, if someone wants to buy for $6000 it will sell it for $6000 not $1. The fact that you said someone might have had fat fingers and pressed the wrong price thus making bitcoin fall 17% or $1000 is absolutely ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:29:45
And you think someone would be able to sell enough Bitcoins by mistake to crash the price by 17%? And if you do, that's something you want to invest in?
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:33:33
I never claimed "exchanges wouldn't allow that". I said that if an exchange had a slippage of 17% on an asset with as large volume as Bitcoin has then why the hell would anyone want to use that exchange?
And as Kraken is a large exchange if they would have a slippage of 17% then surely even you would see something is very wrong with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:36:39
I dont know if you're realizing it but what you're describing is essentially a bubble. It's a lot similar to the tulip mania. If no one should use BTC as a currency then what exactly are you buying? Nothing. It has no actual value. That is a textbook definition of a speculative bubble. 
You should want people to start using BTC as a currency. That's the only way it will survive in the future and not crash down hard once the hype dies off.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:25:17
You can ride it as long as you want. You seem really excited about bitcoin, which is great, you should be. 
But the flaw in your reasoning that others have tried pointing out to you is that it doesnt matter what currency you use to buy the car. If you bought it in BTC for $100k which would later be worth $400k then you've "lost" (not really the right word but whatever) $300k. If you bought it with USD for $100k then those $100k could instead have been used to buy BTC which would now be worth $400k. So even tho you've bought it with USD you still "lost" $300k. The end result is the same. The cost of the car is the opportunity cost; what else could you have used the money for that you now can't since you bought a car?
So it does not matter what currency you use to buy the car. The end result will be the same. That's why your reasoning that you wouldn't spend BTC on goods is flawed. It essentially doesnt matter what currency you used, the opportunity cost will be the same no matter what.

No, the valuation is based on predictions. Even if they don't make any profits today the macro trends suggests that electric vehicles are becoming more and more popular and Tesla being a key player in it are predicted to take a slice of that market share, a market which is currently expanding. Obviously there's some faith in it too as they are predictions and thus everyone will have their own analysis of the market. But the key point is that there actually is an analysis made and not just a gut feeling.
Show me a fundamental analysis on bitcoin that indicates they will take 10% of the market that gold previously had.
Edit: Tesla also has assets, such as their production plants and electric chargers etc. that are also taken into the valuation. Bitcoin is not a company and thus does not own any assets on its own.
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:22:28
No, not at all. Tesla and Apple both have a product and a profit (or expected profit in the future). Their valuation is based on what people believe they will pay out in dividends in the future. Bitcoin's valuation is based on absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:21:17
What profits are Bitcoin going to make in the future? I explained to you the difference between stocks such as Apple and Tesla and Bitcoin. That you don't understand the difference just shows that you dont have any understanding of economics.
I haven't said that Bitcoin won't be used as a currency or as a store of value (i.e. gold) in the future, I simply explained to you why you can't compare it to Tesla or Apple. Right now though Bitcoin is not being used as a currency or as a store of value and it's current valuation is being driven by people buying it to sell it at a higher price in the future. Show me a fundamental (not technical) analysis of why Bitcoin deserves the valuation it currently has. I'm genuinely interested.
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:25:38
Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme in the traditional sense, but that is a terrible argument. You think the billions of dollars invested into Bernie Madoff's scheme were all coming from private investors? There's people making decisions in VC's, they can be tricked or make bad choices just like everyone else. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:25:24
Okay, so in your opinion Bitcoin is overvalued but you don't have any real reason to explain why?
For what it's worth, I agree that it is extremely overvalued. In my opinion the value is closer to 0, as it is currently only being bought because people believe someone else will buy it from them in the future. Practically no one wants to use it as a currency in its current state and so I don't see why it would have any value at all. It wouldn't surprise me if it soon goes the same way as all the other bubbles (dot-com, tulip bulbs, beanie babies etc.)
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:27:51
Based on what though? You haven't given a single argument to back the valuation up, more than "look at the charts". That's a terrible way to value something. It doesn't work that way. Your valuation of $2k-$3k is based on absolutely nothing. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:13:50
What value would Bitcoin provide in the future? Bitcoin is really not comparable to stocks. Reading your comments it seems you don't really have an understanding of how stocks works. I would suggest reading up a bit on it,  would be a good way to start.
Thanks for the link. It was a pretty interesting read. I agree with them that criminals will definitely have, and already has, a use for Bitcoin. However i remain skeptical that it will become the only currency used in the world (also that would be a disaster since it's deflationary). Their arguments for it are pretty weak, and the valuation they later come up with in the paper is based on that assumption which makes me very skeptical. The current costs of using Bitcoin as a currency/means of exchange is high, which has caused the use of it, even for illegal uses, as a currency to go down with Steam etc. giving up on it at the moment. The lightning network seems promising but at this point trying to predict the adoption of bitcoin in the future would be pure speculation. There's nothing wrong to purchase something based on speculation but it's important to remember the difference between investing and speculating.
