So gold has value because it has value?

whole week :(

I don't know about you suckers who paid retail but I downloaded all my bitcoins from limewire

Yeah you're right. I was going for hyperbole haha. Though I would say gold's industrial utility only makes up a tiny part of its current valuation. After all, people liked gold long before microchips. Same thing with bitcoin in that the people FOMOing in now don't give a shit about its legitimate crypto uses as much as they do about its surging price.

I watch bitcoin instead of netflix

Bitcoin is exactly like gold. In terms of how people valuate it, both are useless; one is a shiny rock and the other is magic internet dust. At this point in bitcoin's early development stage when it can't scale, its value is based mostly on pure speculation. Like gold.

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

what's xbt

Never say never. People, esp in this sub, should know better than to predict the price with such certainty. The price could fall to $200 as easily as it could spike to $2000, maybe even more likely because we've never passed $1200 and were at $200 as recently as August 2015.

lol no

How did you get burned? Because of the fork?
@_date: 2017-02-18 23:29:25
that's pretty funny

More bitcoins have been lost by people freaked out by anti-Coinbase comments fumbling around with their own wallets than Coinbase has ever lost.
Coinbase is fine for most people with small balances. It's convenient and easy. If you have a lot BTC, go cold storage.

There is this gentlemen too from 2011

ah yes the dragon sickness

Price is the only interesting thing to most people, and you need people for bitcoin to succeed. If bitcoin is $0.33 like other altcoins no one will give a shit about it

I like localbitcoin in theory because of the privacy, but in reality, I think having to deal with money with random people from the internet is not worth the risk for me.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:34:45
More like common sense
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:51:19
Good on you. You have the right priorities.
I have a Coinbase account so that's the easiest way for me. I don't know about Gemini.
Also,  for tax stuff.

Real estate is a lot of hassle imo and I don't think OP, based on his unawareness of and reluctance to pay taxes, has considered all the costs of homeownership.
It might actually be easier for OP to just rent and keep his assets liquid.
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:15:51
Agreed. OP basically picked the fastest horse at the racetrack. 
He has balls to take the risk, I suppose, so that's some props. It doesn't make me respect him though.

Yeah, I came here looking for a litecoin thread. It's significant news
