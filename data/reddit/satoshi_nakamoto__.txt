should be 
"Bitcoin - (BTC)"
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:02:42
haha well, I dont know everything :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:37:38
actually I can allow to spent unconf funds, but can not specify exactly fee example 120 satoshi per byte, the lowest I can go is "super economy" its 292 sat/byte, there's no "custom fee"?
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:12:07
Copay, let you set fee sat/byte after you try to send, on settigs you have only "economic, normal" fee.
1-no, 2-no.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:40:01
ah thanks, I will sent few coins to test it out.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:44:07
Yeah I know, not in hurry I can wait for days, thanks again :)

fuck Mycelium.
no segwit, no custom fee, no easy way of claiming free $bch.
they were the best one, became the shittiest one!
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:57:32
Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:46:07
the best
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:03:16
it's been trying to sync 2 days and 12 hours,  but 55% it finished maybe for 20hours and last \~16% for like 40hours, now progress per hour is 0.06% from 7%?
This is not bottleneck of CPU or RAM or HDD, simply not connecting to peers.
@_date: 2019-09-01 17:59:20
I hashed this file/photo [
And the .ots file when I checked with editor contains this [
I would like to verify "manualy" out of opentimestamps verification process ?
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:51:51
thanks for your help :)
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:22:08
I just checked, peers connected = 0, cpu usage = 0%
@_date: 2019-09-04 06:22:29
no, do I need to for inbound connections ?
now I have  
9 (In: 0 / Out: 9)
Progress increase per hour 0.19%
est time left for fully sync: 8 days
progress : 66.37%

first of all thank you for your long answer, and I am trying to learn and googled and tryed to add nodes, but learning as you and others.
I was checking on resource monitor and definitely the bottleneck is hard drive, I have 1 SSD and 1 hard drive, you can see the heavily used by bitcoin-qt.exe (Disk D:) is used all time 100%
so the spikes on graph that I posted before of downloading blocks, are that Core downloads lets say 10 blocks or 50blocks then it verifies and it takes a lot of time, that I didn't know such a difference of initial blocks and those blocks from january 2018, I know that with SSD is so much faster but I have only 120GB and use it as C drive.
Another thing is interesting to me that all time CPU usage from bitcoin-qt.exe is 0%, that's why I was confused and thought not downloading blocks and its stuck.
Thanks great community :)

I would like to but my ISP dont let us have public IP, so cant accept incoming connections, I have to pay extra to have public IP.
I increased dbcache to 2000MB, and still its \~100X slower progress then it was the initial sync until reached \~55%, then soo slow download of blocks, so trying to connect to fast peers manualy or I dont know what to do.
I see my post 14 hours ago and progress 66.37%, now 67.5% so 1.13% = 14 hours ?!
here a screenshot of download graph, it's not constant like in the beginning.
@_date: 2019-09-04 21:19:00
what computer resources are used to verify transaction ?
CPU is used by bitcoin-qt.exe 0%, RAM usage is 1087MB, how can you explain?
@_date: 2019-09-04 22:58:56
SSD is used as C drive 120GB for OS (Windows), and I have an old HDD 500GB (D), and Core is downloading and verifying blocks at that old HDD 500GB drive.
installed this tool to check health of HDD, and here's screenshot

Make sure you get last version check on

I use Mycelium (Android) and Electrum (win/mac/linux) with dynamic fees, never had problems!
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:48:50
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:18:49
can anyone send me some testnet coins?¿
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:39:30
first link is saying 120minutes to 'infinit', but actually there's no way you can predict, however I say its very low fee which might take some time to get confirmed, hope Im wrong :)
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:46:33
Ledger uses 'standard' backup words so you can even restore your coins on different wallets not just ledger.
Words generated by Ledger are more important than the Ledger itself, so backup up on safe place and you are good to go.
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:30:00
no way that tx is going to be confirmed within 24hours .
check these websites for fee prediction confirmation
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:23:49
whats your satoshi per byte, or post your tx id.
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:28:43
based on this site, this address belongs to huobi, 4th richest address
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:00:09
already got coins!!!
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:11:37
bc.info sucks.
the easiest way would be electrum, now you have to wait to get confirmed you transactions and if you still  have problems install electrum from  and send bitcoins to one of the electrum addresses and its just few clicks and you can sign mag, I can guide you, or maybe you can do it on your own its easy.
please back up seeds, in case you screw up somethig
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:56:41
no, only BTC
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:19:32
try and change electrum server.
on the right corner down click to the green circle and pick up random servers from the list and check your status of your transaction.
check your tx id on block explorers, if you got confirmations, dont worry your coins are safe.
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:30:07
