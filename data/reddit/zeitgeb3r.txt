If there are 1.3 billion people in China, and if 1% of them own cryptos, we are looking at 13 million people selling parts of their cryptos all at once, sending the market crashing into bear territory.
This is good news for me, because I only buy cryptos in bear market. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:53:11
1.1 million people on Robinhood wait list. More participants mean more money pouring in to cryptos.

Governments can print money willy nilly without being backed by other assets. It's called the "modern monetary theory".

My wife said the same, so I tried to sell her on Craigslist for 0.0004 BTC. I had no buyer.

offtopic: Similar thing happened to me. My wife died in her sleep last year with a heart attack. I only found out the next day when I tried waking her up. All along I was asleep next to a dead body probably a good 5 whole hours. Since then I have not been able to fall asleep properly without full on ceiling lights being turned on as I fear her ghost would visit me.

When you leave money in the crypto exchange, they own the crypto because they have the private key. 
Whoever has the private key is the owner.
