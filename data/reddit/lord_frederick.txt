:) But seriously, he has an Ipad on a chain around his neck, and I am certain he would tattoo his face with LEDs if it were possible.

[Yup, and he spent $1,000,000 for the domain.]( But this interview is simply moronic writing and paid-advertising. For example:

I partly get paid in bitcoin so I use them just as currency, even if I start spending them after I finish fiat currency, or when I find somebody interested in bitcoin but doesn't know how to use them.
