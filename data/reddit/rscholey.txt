Given a choice who would you rather have apply for the patents.  Coinbase, Apple or Samsung? I would personally have more faith in Coinbase and if my company I'd do the same.  No harm in being the first to protect ideas from other companies who's only intention is to make money from patents.

I was thinking it was already available everywhere in the USA.  How many states is it now available in and what's the target date for every state to have access?

"governments and central banks, could create a viable alternative"
Viable maybe who would want to use blockchains controlled by the governments and banks. Are these not the very people who have got us into the huge mess we are in right now?

When you're a new account you are subject to limits that will increase with time. Same for Coinbase.  Not a big deal, it's just put in place to protect you in as well as Circle from fraud.

What exactly are they asking with regards to your transaction?

Why do you consider it a bs device? I think we don't yet know the potential of what it can offer, what hardware it has and what software will come with it . Also the cost of the device is I think something that would not be significant to its intended audience of professional developers.

Can you explain a bit more about what this means and what the advantage of this is.  I'm new to all this so not quite sure why I would want direct access to the network.

Can I ask.  What are the advantages of using Multibit HD over mytrezor?  Thanks
@_date: 2015-10-12 07:32:30
Do you know of any advantages that the other wallets offer over myTrezor?

How do you know it's No17?

What capabilities does Multibit bring that mytrezor doesn't have.  thanks

I didn't see any mention of Multibit.  From what I had been reading earlier I saw many people suggesting to use this wallet. Any comments?
