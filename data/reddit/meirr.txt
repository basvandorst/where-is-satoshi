Alright, thank you much. 
I'm minimally involved in Bitcoin in that I've spent a sizable amount of fiat to gather an array of private keys used to sign off on the transactions (i.e. Bitcoins). I think I have a fundimenal understanding of how the decentralized network (i.e. public ledger), miners, transaction verification, encryption, ect. ect. ect. work. But I'm currently ignorant when it comes to the formal theories/theorems/education in finance and economic schools of thought that govern decentralized monetary systems/ commodities / economies. I think Bitcoin may actually be somewhat unique in that respect, but I'll have to search for more data. 
I'm a computer scientist and general entrepreneur by trade. So often I find myself wishing there was more time in the day for me to research and understand everything going on in the world. At present, Bitcoin, global monetary system, current planetary conflicts (wars), and the study of Earth's weather system has my attention. But I just can't keep up with it all. Sucks really.  
But I digress. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to provide the data/screenshots that you did. Best wishes!

That was exceptionally well written (and read). I enjoyed that. I'd like to hear an equally well formed argument contesting this sentiment.

Absolutely. If that's all you're able or willing to give. However, if you're able or willing to give me more, that would be more "fine enough".  :-)

Could you point me in the direction of any data that supports your statements? Specifically, data that shows that as the price begins to recover, large players have been coming in and crushing it with major sell offs? 
Also, could you point me in the direction of anyone who also has your opinion and/or backs said opinion up with data? 
I genuinely appreciate anything you can provide. Personally, I can't imagine intelligent individuals who hold large stakes in the world monitory system wouldn't attempt to crush the success of Bitcoin. I would think it's a threat to their control.
