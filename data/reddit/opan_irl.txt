Who taught you your opinion?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:50:46
So nothing we may learn could ever change that?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:20:06
Nice opinion , where'd you get it?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:19:55
Well being better than another because of race is only a thought but Nazis exist.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:01:09
So your imagination doesn't work. If I said a pink buffalo with dragon wings existed. It did exist in your mind but for a second
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:33:46
What made you assume that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:01:48
So you would accept new knowledge that allowed us to divide by zero?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:13:16
So you would except no new knowledge that changed the way we understand life?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:59:27
For people to acknowledge that new scientific facts come up everyday and one could possibly change the way we see mathematics even zero.

Naw son
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:52:09
If we know it exists it is something right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:11:39
So you know all there is to know?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:58:33
If we didn't even know zero existed before isn't it plausible to say we just don't understand how to divide by zero?
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:51:07
What is the case in your opinion?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:44:55
So you won't accept new knowledge
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:49:04
Wouldn't the guys that didn't know about zero be saying the same thing?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:28:38
We are talking about it right?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:45:03
Isn't it a small decimal number with many numbers in it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:36:50
I never said I was right. I only presented a plausible theory you denied. We didn't even know zero existed but you are implying we know all there is to know about mathematics and zero
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:52:59
If we know it exists it can't be nothing right?
