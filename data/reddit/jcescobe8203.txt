LOL. Why do u keep posting the same thing over and over again? Did you break? Do you need to be restarted? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:20:42
And then buy back in at $20k XD
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:51:14
Oh nice, I did not know that.

GDAX has a $10k daily withdrawal limit and it’s fairly easy to apply for a larger limit if you need to withdraw bigger amount of funds at once. 
As far as which banks would allow what? Paying off your loans? I’m guessing most. I know my bank wouldn’t stop me from paying off my loan. Not sure I understand where your question is trying to go.......
@_date: 2018-09-02 07:10:24
Hahaha. God I really hope it’s not a sincere question either.

As I tell everyone I meet that asks about Bitcoin, read The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous and then come back and we can talk. Otherwise I just generally decide not to even waste my time trying to educate people about Bitcoin. It's their prerogative if they want to learn about it or just spout off tired old arguments.   
EDIT: And anyone that knows anything about Gold knows its main main use is as sound money, and store of value. Those uses in electronics is way too small of a part of what gives it the value it has. That is also talked about in "The Bitcoin Standard".

Working in stocks and finance for most of my career, I find it absolutely depressing how many people take issue with Bitcoin but have absolutely not issues with our current corrupt system but will call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme due to their lack of understanding and vision. The shit that goes on in the traditional financial system is orders of magnitude more corrupt and “Ponzi-schemish” that Bitcoin. 
You’re paying a high opportunity cost for your willful ignorance my friend. But be my guest. Keep repeating the same tired lines that the banksters and govt criminals are peddling to keep the sheep in line. Keep putting your faith in corrupt central banks, fractional reserve banking, social security (an actual Ponzi scheme), over inflated stock market and bond market.

Not sure what country you may be in but I'm in the USA. I've used Ally and Chase, neither one have given me issues. Bank of America didn't freeze my account but they gave me some friction.

Hahahaha. Can’t tell if this is sarcastic trolling or if you’re actually serious. If so, then you’re paying a huge opportunity cost for your willing ignorance.

Bitcoin will reach 19k again loooong before 2023. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:58:33
I'm very confident this prediction is going to be so so so wrong. I'm screen-shoting it. Haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:48:33
You need a new bank then. Bank of American tried pulling the same shit one me and I dumped them for Ally. No issues, no fee's either. As long as I have to keep using banks, I'll be using Ally. I'm just glad I didn't give up and not get in the crypto game when BoA tried to pull their bullshit on me and got a chance to invest in cool tech (ETH, NEO, Lisk) early. The banks will try to do everything they can to impede us cuz they see a legit threat. That alone should tell you this tech is worth looking at.

Hahahahaha. This is by far the most sheep like and ignorant statement I’ve heard in a long long time. A lot of extremely smart and successful people that aren’t “losers” by a long shot see the faults in the current banking system and recognize the need for it to change. A cursory look into all the crooked shit banks have done all over the world would kept you from making such a stupid statement. Look at how much money HSBC laundered for the drug cartels in Mexico alone. And that is literally just the tip of Banks corruption. Forget the whole 2008 financial collapse.

I agree. Its exactly what I was hoping for. For better or worse, regulations are coming and if the SEC isn’t going to come in with an overly heavy hand in crypto than we should be very thankful. Especially in current market conditions. Something more hawkish from the SEC could have really sent this market into a spiral. At least now we have a chance to stop the bleeding. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:08:28
Exactly, education is big. 
Basically what the SEC Chairman and CFTC Head told the senators is that the Trojan horse is clear to bring inside the gates. Haha

I wonder if that even matters if the person has managed to renounce their citizenship. At that point, no longer being citizens what can the US gov/IRS even do? And why would banks report huge influxes of money at that point about a non-US citizen to the IRS? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:26:51
Banks and ICOs already operate under all that you mentioned. Not sure how that changes anything now. 
If this gives some regulatory certainty to institutions, then IMO it’s bullish because they’ll be that much closer to jumping in fully.

She literally just shotguns negative misconceptions and misinformation about Bitcoin. Propaganda is a perfect way to describe it. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:25:58
Don’t know what would be worse. Whether this article was intentionally and maliciously written with blatant misinformation to try and mislead people or if it was pure incompetence. Either one is highly disturbing. If you do not understand even the basics of how mining farms work, you shouldn’t be writing an article at all about crypto or Bitcoin.

Dayum. They covered all their bases. Lol.
