It's not really about loss prevention. The initial investment was so small that even a 100% loss wouldn't hurt.
It's more about managing and accessing the sum the investment has grown to, and might grow to in the future. An investment position that cannot be accessed reliably (not fungible) is not useful to the investor - and a 100% loss of €15,000, now that would hurt! I want to know if it makes sense to continue to deal with a five figures position in Bitcoin if the future of the blockchain is uncertain and may or may not result in being unable to sell the coins at a time of my choosing.

That's good to hear. :) Do you expect it to continue to work fine in every situation possible, regardless of which direction current developments go?

Ah? I did not know that. That's definitely something I will be looking into.


Thanks for your input.

Great answer, thanks for actually focusing on the question :)

I had them stored in a wallet of my on for a while. As the blockchain kept growing, my dislike of that solution kept growing. I don't need to dedicate swathes of space on my disk for a virtual currency, or spend days waiting for the blockchain to download everytime I re-install the application. The whole notion of "owning" a record of a number without any intrinsic value is flawed anyway.
But that's completely off topic and unrelated to my question. I just want to know your take on whether or not the network is in a bad state right now and/or may enter one in the foreseeable future.

Ah, but there's an even more fundamental rule in investing: "Don't trade what you don't understand."
Clearly my understanding of Bitcoin has fallen behind over time. Before I can determine X, or if I even need an X, I first need to learn more. ;)

Reports of transactions taking over a week or being pushed out of the queue, mostly.
I can't just push a button and get &gt;€15,000 sent my way in a single transaction. All trustworthy trading places I know - including the one that actually stores my balance - don't let you move that kind of volume unless you're a trusted regular with a lot of transaction volume under your belt. I, having moved a few hundred euros many years in the past, am not a trusted regular. I need to go bit by bit, over multiple transactions. If each one takes a week, and carries a risk of falling through entirely, that's bad news for me.
Of course, I could be reading this all wrong. Which is why I am asking for opinions here. I take it that your opinion is that there are no actual problems with trading bitcoins?

I understand the technology behind Bitcoin well enough to know that if the transaction volume rises faster than the rate at which transactions are processed, the technology has a fundamental problem with scaling. And a technology that doesn't scale is not going to revolutionize anything.
The question is, can everyone agree on a path forward to improve the technology? I've honestly not come across much in the way of mutual agreement in my (admittedly brief) foray into these discussions.

Thanks for your assessment.
