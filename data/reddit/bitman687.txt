What does a neckbeard, cracked phone, weed pipe and Jesus sandles have to do with anything btc? Retard.

Oh it's certainly not me I'm worried about. Just an example. Good day, sir.

If it would get extreme, there would be a barter system used instead of any kind of currency. Example: my canned food for some of your guns. Any kind of money wouldn't mean shit in a long term survival situation. Even gold bars. Just Hodl

No shit? I thought the mobile app was the same as coinbase pro. Wtf?

I tried transferring my coins to my ledger and it says  funds on hold from sept.7 for an additional 5 days until the transfer clears. But when you use a cc or debit card its instant.
@_date: 2018-09-15 01:31:59
Ok. The only reason I went this route was because there is a lower fee than using a cc or debit card. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:04:41
What the fuck?
@_date: 2018-09-15 01:02:18
Do you mean that's what is needed in order for holds not to happen or?

I just bought a psu from overstock and just used bitcoin. Didn't have to convert anything, they have an option to scan or copy their address and the buyer just sends the coin. Many different selections of coins actually.

Currently the difficulty is far too great to mine with a laptop, young one. If/when the reward becomes low enough that large mining farms simply go away, then and only then could you mine with said laptop.

Diamonds are worthless. Man made. Pieces of shit.

Of course it is. I certainly wasn't saying gold is better.
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:06:18
Never really thought of it that way, good to know.
Thank you kind sir!
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:07:59
Maybe check connection? Ive bought much less then that before (actually last night) and i had no problems whatsoever. $20 usd worth.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:58:40
Then i guess they just take a gamble on their numermatic special gold plated tungsten bars or coins.
 
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:08:38
Jesus Christ. Definitely a no no then.
Thanks for commenting good fellow!

Why all the negativity?
Hold till it hits bottom, then buy more to get more coin, then use said coin for cool shit. Or normal shit.
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:52:38
You basically scratch the stone with the bar, then drop the acid on the scratch mark. The other thing is most if not all the gold bars ( at least the ones i have seen) all had serial numbers. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:24:35
Then just bite it. If its gold you'll leave a mark, if its tungsten you'll lose a tooth.

A kit for checking gold content can be had for like 10 bucks at HF. Basically you scratch the gold on a proofing stone and drip a drop of certain strength acid on the stone, if it turns a noted color then it is the noted karat.

I would never ever scam anyone. I fucking hate scammers. I got scammed once as well. Im just trying to help you get into bitcoin buddy.
TO THE MOOOON!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:21:45
I have educated myself on all the risks. Just asking for some advice as there is absolutely no one that i know personally that is even remotely into bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:37:32
I would have transferred everything to a hardware wallet. Once my waiting time is finished for my purchase, thats exactly what i will be doing. 2 days to go.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:19:07

I just remember that when I did a bank transfer to coinbase I had to wait for funds to clear in order to make a purchase. I have not tried it since then. Maybe they changed it which would be nice but I do remember it being extremely annoying. It could also have been my banks fault. Which is why we're all here.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:54:44
Just remember when you use Robinhood, you do not have any bitcoin. Zero. Zilch. You hold no keys.
Not your keys, not your coin.
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:48:40
Scammers be gettin desperate.
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:26:02
Yes but in order to make a purchase with bank transfer you have to wait to make said purchase after funds clear.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:01:06
Buy the other half back, chicken dick.
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:02:39
If you do purchase on coinbase make sure you use a credit/bank card to do the purchase so you can get it at the price you want. Only thing you will wait for is your btc to clear. If you do money transfer to coinbase, yes you have smaller fees but you have to wait much longer for your funds to be clear as in up to a week. Which also means the price can and will change quite a lot.
@_date: 2019-06-01 00:20:21
I don't know for sure but I do know you can sell your gold there. Don't know if they can do an exchange though.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:05:53
If it sounds too good to be true, walk away.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:34:46
That's horrible. I can't stand scammers.
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:54:27
Here's an example for you, I read somewhere that if you signup at Coinex and purchase 100 CET tokens and hold them, the exchange will reward you with their dividend allocation plan. They pretty much divide up all their extra tokens at the end of the day and distribute them to all the CET holders. I bought 100 CET for around $10 USD about a month ago and am now being rewarded many other different tokens. Including Btc, Bch, Eth, Usdt, Btm, Cdy, Dash, Eos, Etc, Hydro, and many others. All fractions of a token but it all adds up.
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:27:23
Yep, sounds just like a normal bank. And all the little nickel and dime fees. With alllllll the middlemen. We dont need anymore extra added fees.
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:02:21
Isn't that what the point of Bitcoin is? To ELIMINATE the middleman.... Go somewhere else cheese dick.
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:55:57
I painted some rocks with awesome crypto symbols for Berks County Rocks or BCR on FB.
Now lets see if one of you assholes can find it!
@_date: 2018-07-01 16:20:41
Delete this damn post, titles like this are the enemy of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:30:36
I started about a month ago, only bought $9 and change worth of the CET token, which came out to 100.487 or something like that of tokens and my balance so far is $12.53. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 03:21:55
Haha, no.
In Berks County, P.A. they have a thing where you paint a rock with whatever design you want, and you hide it. Then the person who finds it either hides it again or keeps it. But whoever finds it should post a pic of it to the FB page so it can be tracked how far it goes. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 03:11:50
You got it man!
I got my kids making them too.
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:31:21
Why couldnt he just use one of us to buy him bitcoin? He would send someone money, they would send bitcoin. Fucking that simple. Someone was having this same issue a few months ago, I made contact with him, we were almost about to do the transaction and he got cold fucking feet. 
I WILL NOT SCAM YOU.
Just trying to honestly help you. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:36:33
Why would he want to re-sell them right away? He could just wait till he gets of age to sell them. Isn't the whole point of this to acquire bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:16:24
I would try and figure out a way.
The problem I was thinking about was the transfer of funds from the buyer to the purchaser of the bitcoin. You could do a direct transfer between banks but there is going to be a trust barrier there. It can be done. Then once the funds are transferred, the purchaser of bitcoin sends said coin to YOUR wallet. Of course the transfer fee would need to be agreed upon, but yes, it can be done.
@_date: 2018-07-09 13:07:41
I wasnt actually trying to sell them, i was doing this for a thing on Facebook.
Buuuut..... im at work right now, ill talk to you when im done.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:44:33
On apmex you can buy gold with btc. Not like anyone would want to actually do that.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:56:07
Hahahahahaaa! Number one rule in crypto, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
