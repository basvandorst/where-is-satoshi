@_date: 2018-11-02 19:41:06
it also said he received 3 cents on his thing but is that possibly bitcoin because I sent him 0.03 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:07:46

I think the wallet was called blockchain...do I have any legal recourse?
@_date: 2018-11-03 12:04:33
im using electrum and I just copy n pasted his address n sent it...I think he's using a block chain wallet or something

@_date: 2018-11-03 12:07:47
