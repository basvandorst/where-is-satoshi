I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say you didn't have 2 fact auth..... So why are you complaining. Do me a favor, next time you are driving in the city, set your spare set of keys on the seat, but lock the doors. See how long your car lasts in the parking lot. If you don't take securing you assets seriously, why would you expect anyone to care?

Bitcoin will fail more because of people like you OP. You and your kind have infiltrated this system and are set to destroy it for self righteous reasons. When you have your bitcoin "stolen" would you rather they devalue everyone else's holding value to accommodate your misfortune? (Like the world Bank/federal reserve does when billions were stolen from ATMs and the SWIFT system) Or would you rather teach people how to secure their assets in their own possession? Your answer will tell a lot about your intentions here.

You are uneducated, illogical, and bad at assumptions. I make high 6 figures and pay well above 20% taxes a year. I actually pay my own health care, full boat, no deductible and feel everyone should do the same(I get $0 government assistance and feel even if you make 25k a year shouldn't get assistance, If you are poor you need to prioritize your life, if you can't afford something, why should I pay for it for you?). Your assumption that I believe we shouldn't pay taxes and get free stuff is an assumption based off no information I have provided to you. I do, however, believe we should pay for what we use and not for what we don't IE, 60% of my tax dollars going to fund wars that never end when we have families that can't eat in the USA(I am a US citizen, currently working in Canada on a  business project). So in conclusion. You are very uneducated if you believe just because I don't want to pay taxes to things I don't believe in, I can't use the public roads, Is asinine. Especially considering what I DO WANT TO USE and pay for makes up less than 5% of the total US budget.

Don't think about mining as meaningless hash, please. It is the act of serving the customers(of bitcoin), decentralizing the ledger transactions, ensuring that future transactions confirm. Who cares if people think "it is the devil." You can't convince everyone. I know older people to this day that don't use Checks or Credit cards(Technological advances of their time that these people refuse to adapt to). My relation to the banks on each corner is a perfect comparison as BTC needs miners(as well as nodes, devs, etc etc) to confirm transactions. 
As Far as the Reddit comparison, where did I say it used as much as btc mining, I simply stated it is a "WASTE" no matter what it uses. It is a free service, too. Do you know how much twitter uses? Netflix streaming? Music torrents? Snapchat? My point is, whose business is it to judge where someone spends their time or money? No matter how much some outsider views it as "WASTEFUL"

It's because the bad is also generally met with no discussion. You just made two VERY bold claims and didn't back them up. This is NOT btc-e trollbox
First, lets just say crypto though, because any coin could be successful. The demands of users to shop online in a quick and secure was is in demand. Can and will crypto fill that gap? I think it is more likely than another cc design with a chip that has been proven hackable from up to 20 feet away. 
You get my point. 
Before you say crypto isn't secure, most people that are hacked on a day to day basis still think the "you wont believe what happens NEXT!" links on sites are safe to click. Education and security software/2fa solves that everytime.

Ok, since I sense I am dealing with a little bit of caged animal that can't think outside of the box. Imagine you deal with corn. You trade it,  you farm it, you sell it. Right? You're a big farmer, you trade 1000's of  bushels a day to pay for your drinking disorder. You normally get 25 bushels a day, and you sell about 75% of those to pay for your farm, employees, and hookers. Now one day a mob of corn eating  homeless people swarm farms all over the world AT ONCE, and you, as well as other farmers, are only able to make 12.5 bushels a day now because the homeless people shit on half your fields making them infertile. You can trade all day still with your digital bushels online, But the SUPPLY of corn is deminishing. Hence, the price with slowly rise, no matter how much you trade to and from yourself. If you can't grasp a simple concept of economics, I don't know how to explain it to you.

Ok lets take movies, just movies, a 89 billion dollar industry, raises it prices year over year. In some countries it is 27$ a movie ticket. I'm pretty sure they are getting paid, and well at that. Who says that people that torrent don't buy the movie after they see it. I know I do if it is good enough. How many times have you seen a shitty movie or listened to crappy music AFTER you bought it?

Not all retards are autistic you narrow minded liberal. There is LD, cerebral palsy, down sydrome, severely disabled, etc etc. My wife has a PhD in special education. Autism is not a real classification, it is a money grab by greedy low lives in this world that prey on simple minded people that have a hard on to label conditions in a "spectrum"

LMAO, you are trolling right? How can you feel secure with your bank, that SWIFT gets hacked just about monthly. There is an illusion of security with a bank. And it's simple because they need money ASAP so that can write more loans. Please tell me you're joking.

Also, who's stopping a bank from creating a physical back door, and walking out with only your money. Nothing. Nothing at all.

You shouldn't use ignorant fuck in a negative context, this isn't the 2000s. Seriously, retard? Of all the words you choose to get pissed about. He didn't say, "your sister is a retard" albeit true, he was just generally using the term. Who are you to tell him what words to use? You bleeding heart liberal.

Just because Fiat is fudgable(yes fudgable, all they do is fudge things). When that money is stolen, where do you think it comes from to be put back? They take a little from every account to reimburse yours. Then they create more out of thin air. Don't be fooled by a false sense of security. And you should get your facts straight. Your computer is just as probable to get hacked to steal your bank account info than it is to get hacked to empty your btc wallet and key. BTC has a VERY low probability to get hacked. So much so that people feel confident to leave 100k btc in one wallet.  You are a very misinformed person for someone so concerned about "security"

But typing your password into online banking is? You understand that banking websites have some of the most basic security that is easily bypassed.
