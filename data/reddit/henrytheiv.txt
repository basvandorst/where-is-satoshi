As long as the global economy continues to gain strength (and specifically the US and China's economy because they are  juggernauts) bitcoin will be hard pressed to become valuable currency.  Bitcoin did very well while the economy was tanking and people looked for alternatives for their money.  Now, the fact that it is a currency with a commodity like value (because of its low overall level of acceptance), it is less desirable than the dollar.  Consider that if you bought bitcoin a year ago, you would have made a great profit.  But if you bought a few months ago, you may have lost money....up to half of your value at this point depending on when you bought in.  If we were in a situation where the dollar lost half its value over a 6 month period, we'd be so screwed that an investment in bitcoin wouldn't matter (i.e. major infrastructure deterioration, natural disaster, or apocalypse)

This sucks for you, and I'm sorry it happened, but it is your problem to the tune of $250.  Most merchants I've dealt with that sell prepaid debit cards require cash or debit with pin for transactions.
  People will always try to scam you, no matter what the currency medium is.  We had a couple guys use a stolen credit card number to purchase store giftcards online, come in to a physical store and buy expensive merchandise, then return them without a receipt to get a new giftcard that had no paper connection to the stolen giftcards (except the fact that a quick CSM noticed it and documented everything, which let our AP get video of it all).  They got caught.

it helps having a business model that doesn't look like a pyramid scheme
