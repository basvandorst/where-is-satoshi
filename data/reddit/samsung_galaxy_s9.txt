Daaaamn boi, 38 fucking Bitcoins? You should've done a test send first. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 20:02:52
That's why things like this should be done on a blockchain. You file a claim on the blockchain claiming 0.27 BTC, it's public and can't be edited. Why we're not using it for that, I don't know.

@_date: 2019-03-17 23:12:25
Download these 2 apps: 
Import your private key into bither, and select "get fork coins", it will ask you for a BitPie address to send each fork to, you must have these addresses generated before you do this because bither will only send them to BitPie (or at least that's how it worked last time I used it). Hope this helps.

@_date: 2019-03-01 06:35:51
No, if the function is controlled completely from within the wallet, the merchant can't just withdraw funds whenever they want. What I asked was if there is a wallet that can send recurring payments. Nobody wants it you say? Millions of people use recurring payments on their debit cards to automatically take care of things like monthly phone bills. Why should Bitcoin be any different? A wallet could easily be programmed to send a payment on the expected due date of each bill. Whether or not a user friendly version of it exists or not (mobile app) is beyond me, but don't you think it would help adoption? 
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:11:35

@_date: 2019-03-05 17:05:52
Wrong. Banks can put your account in the negatives for a bounced check. Credit cards are debt by default, as are student loans, mortgages, etc. All these things are controlled with fiat. You will never see a Bitcoin address with a negative balance.

If you tell people you have 1.2 bitcoins but don't offer any financial incentive for them to help you, they usually won't help you.
