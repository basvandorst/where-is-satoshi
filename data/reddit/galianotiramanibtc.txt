Every time you spend any amount bitcoins from an address the entire balance of the address is sent out. The amount you didn't spend is called change. Most new wallet software sends the change of the transaction to a new address held within that wallet instead of sending it back to the original address.
So each time this guy spends some of his bitcoins, the entire 3,000 is atomically sent to a new address under his control.

Can someone point me to a guide for creating a cheap node?
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:06:15
Price is based on supply and demand, unless good news drives up demand as a result of speculation, you will need to wait for a decrease in supply or an increase in real demand for the bitcoin price to have a decent rise (ie. 2016 the halvening)

I agree with you from a philosophical standpoint, but that doesn't change the fact that Shrem knew what he was doing was illegal and that his deceit of his own coworkers was immoral. Let's face it funneling money to drug sales out of greed for profits is a terrible idea.

There is no accredited investor status necessary for buying btc from secondmarket, what you need is not the investment fund, just contact them and say you want to buy bitcoin, I believe the minimum order is 25 btc, they will verify your ID and then you send a wire.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:45:28
this is so awesome I cant even believe its real...
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:40:18
in that case the bank teller would file a suspicious activity report
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:30:43
so shrem was charged with aiding and abetting faiellas unlicensed msb?
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:29:18

@_date: 2014-12-19 22:40:57
I am familiar with the fincen msb registration process, but how does one get licensed?
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:48:54
no, why would that happen?
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:29:37
no it didnt, read the indictment to see what happened
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:11:47
If you read the indictment it is alleged that he knowingly helped a bitcoin seller on the dark web resell bitcoins that they both knew were going to be used to buy drugs.
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:09:54
was bitinstant ever a registered msb with fincen?
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:42:47
weird they dont mention this 
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:52:38
I did post this without realizing it was old news... the fact that it gets up voted like this is hilarious! Long live bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:15:40

@_date: 2015-05-04 01:42:55
Why would you file a CTR at cryptsy?
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:00:09

how do I integrate trezor w greenAddress?
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:44:23
so if I use " write to hardware wallet" it is using the seed displayed on my screen which is compromised as it is displayed on my computer?
ooops wrong reddit account lets try that again $20
@_date: 2015-05-20 04:12:50
Its very sad
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:28:26
I understand you removed the bitstamp order book from you system, dont you think it will  be hard to gain traction and customer base with zero liquidity and tiny volume? Do you plan on adding more order books? Why no USA banking?
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:24:04
I could draw it into wet cement all around the city
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:59:48
so by clicking use hardware wallet seed instead I am not sharing the actual seed with greenaddress, just prompting it to look to the trezor to sign transactions? I get this error message  "TREZOR initialisation failed: Error: Plugin configuration found, but could not be used. Make sure it is has proper format and a valid signature"

Would a "hard" or "soft" fork cause a disruption in transactions or canceled/invalid transactions that would cause faith in bitcoin to be lost and a corresponding drop in price?
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:50:33

encrypting it defeats the purpose of having a seed that is written onto a piece of paper I wouldnt want to worry about a thumb drive failing

Coinbase is required to "tattle" if the government deems they are not doing a good job of preventing and reporting crimes through their service they will be out out of business by civil and criminal penalties. Coinbase doesn't care what you do w your bitcoin, they just want to profit, they can profit of the government shuts them down.

If you are selling on a personal level and not as a business no money transmission or money services laws apply to you. Go ahead and sell. If you are looking for a daily limits on selling as a business, they dont exist, if you are selling as a business in ANY amount then you must comply with state and federal laws.

Corporate entity is irrelevant, whether you are operating as a business is up to their interpretation. If you are divesting thats covered in fincen guidance that says you are a user and not an exchanger. All guidance is very vague and up for interpretation, er on side of caution.

Maybe make it standard operating procedure to reach out to the banks every time someone attaches a new bank to your service and present to them an explanation of your business as well as your THOROUGH BSA compliance standards.
