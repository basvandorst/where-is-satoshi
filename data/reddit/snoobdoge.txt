hey, could you reconsider? I just posted an update to my history and could really use some help.  Here is my new post:

Ukyo's Bitfunder 15 BTCs.

nothing on Maui.

sorry about that, did not intended to be rude. The idea of calling my bank puts my mind into a bad mood.
@_date: 2014-06-07 03:38:49
thank you for the ideas.

I really like this idea, any suggestions on which prepaid card I could get having in mind that I'm not from the USA? Then I could use this anywhere and end the nightmares from my current card.

Right, try calling a bank in another country to talk about credit card issues. I will rather trade some Bitcoin.

Hey Charlie, thank you so much for trying to help, I really appreciate that you took the time to post here while you have many things going.  As noted by bobabuey;  I think my best option is to find someone in Maui to trade, will do so with the most care and let everyone know how it goes. Thank you again!

if you are going to point my "social competence", you may want to realize the fact that you are using your time on a forum to point on others peoples aptitudes.
