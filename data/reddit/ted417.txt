Lol. You're just another human being. You can go fuck yourself for all I care. You might have a good idea, but you have poor social skills.
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:29:32
Lol, nope. Y'knawmean?
@_date: 2014-11-17 04:23:58

Yeah, since a long time ago.

Question about hat: will it be implemented in tf2?

Nice try, OP's 2nd account.

Looks like I picked the wrong week to not save 15% on my car insurance by switching to GEICO.

Do you need me to repeat it again?

It's a circlejerk, yes, but it also shows that Apple is such a shitty company. You're supposed to do what you want with your fucking phone. The company shouldn't own the phone that you bought.

Well, I can afford losing $60, but I didn't think that it was going to be that bad. Oh well, now it's the waiting game and I hope prices stay low for my next paycheck.

I think he's saying that he's selling his Wallet.dat file. He has 3.489 bitcoins in his Wallet.dat file. He can't remember his password and it's about 20 characters long. He'll sell it to anyone that thinks they can crack the password.

Thing is that I'm pretty poor and just putting in money paycheck to paycheck. Kind of like a savings account.

I'm also new to this, but yeah, you'll get what you paid for. If you buy coins while the note and checkmark aren't there, you'll get what you paid for. If you buy coins while the note and checkmark are there, you'll pay for the price of bitcoins in exactly 4 business days.

I bought .05 bitcoins at the dip of $850 yesterday. I though I was the biggest genius ever.
