What prevents them from requesting the chunk from the network on another ip to satisfy the challenge, then deleting it.

Right now isnt bitcoin truly in an inflationary stage. I think your point is aimed at the expected valuation vs the dollar. Also maybe default by the barrower could be mitigated to some degree by collateralization if it is a larger loan. Then we just pair the loan with a future contract to sell the risk?

Yea I'm not sure how that can be solved some services in conjunction to bitcoin do require trust. I guess my point was the lotto ticket concept might be novel relative to micro transactions. Maybe this paired with open transaction or some type of multi Sig.

I want a portable device that holds the keys to my decentralized cloud storage (storj / maid safe etc). So then I could just plug it in and it maps a drive and the keys are safe.

It makes a good point. I don't even know how the IRS made the leap to property. A key is 256 Bits of data. Thats the beauty of bitcoin is it is not property or money or a commodity. Its technically information. How exactly are you going setup a law that has some rules for these bits and different rules for those bit. Childish or not satoshi replaced the basic function of the entire banking system with a few thousand lines of code and its pretty funny. The OP is mocking them cause they are trying to regulate mathematics that are a order of magnitude more powerful. Why dont we pass some laws to deal with lightning. I mean it strikes where ever it wants with out warning and its loud.

What prevents a user from downloading a chunk as the challenge comes in. Then deleting the file. Rinse Repeat.

Seems like it should be relative to the amount. $100 should be no big deal. So what laws would a company be breaking. That the atm is not.

This is looking from the perspective of wanting more dollars as though the exchange rate is anything more than noize at this point. The truth of the mater for well heeled investors is that it is a far greater risk not to hold some bitcoin. The bottom line is if you want more dollars, I believe your wish is going to be granted.

Physical portable security. With no way to hack keys as the device does not expose them to the internet kinda like the trezor. Its related to bitcion as a decentralized cloud storage solution.
I think the main problem will be just like bitcoin. Key generation and protection.
With a physical device it affords you passive protection that you cant screw up and would be pretty simple for anyone to use..... Just plug it in. Kinda like a roaming mapped disk.

Can anyone request a specific chunk and is there anyway they can collude to try and pull off the above scam.

At most from this point the number of coins that can exist will  almost double. So at worst the dilution is ever only going to be half of where it is now. Point being it may put downward pressure in the short run. But bitcoins are going to become more and more scarce. For some this current inflation allows a second chance to get some exposure. Miners remind you also have taken a massive leap of faith to get the coins and have had to front the cash to do so at the equivalent market prices of hardware and electricity. In the current situation. They are in actuality probably holding coins propping up the price.

I was waiting for this.
