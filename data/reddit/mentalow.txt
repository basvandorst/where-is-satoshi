Here is the catch: Chris currently claims this is due to the tether hack. Thing is, he recently removed canaries on his Twitter profile. Canaries are to say something that a NDA prohibit you from saying. But, he also claims that he has no NDA with Tether but only one with Bitfinex.. ��

So now. Instead of having the original $10,000 limit, or a $0 limit - I have a $6,805.00 limit. Sweet.
