For anyone having trouble and feeling like they are powerless to solve this puzzle try something a lot less complicated.
I sent the hidden address some funds, here is the transaction 
Attached to it I left a message as a memo...what is that message? The prize is 10% of what ever bitcoin I happen to but probably won't receive as a result of participating in this experiment

there is already a cost when considering these machines need a phone # to text codes to...having to get a phone that is not attached to you is cost enough...instacoin is charging over 10% fees...will love to see competition drive those fees lower.

when the power goes out, paper wallets will be worth a lot when the grids are back up

its not about how it is spent...it is about YOU controlling ACTUAL money

I was thinking EMP style black out where even wrist watches are finished

because only paper wallets will survive, meaning MUCH less bitcoin. When you reintroduce demand with such a small supply itll spike the price per 1 btc

Please compete hard with Instacoin ATM's... would love to finally see ATM fees lower...competition is always good

funny how this came out within the last 24 hours of this comment

best part about this all is that DASH masternodes will hopefully become more affordable. The interest earned is a great way to get more bitcoin ethereum and litecoin while the whole market takes a deep breath until the next wave comes in

you didnt see the news? I forget the guys name but there was 20,000 bitcoin buy order... people are speculating that he/they were accumulating OTC and then went on the markets to push up the price... who knows...looks like it was also an epic short squeeze

IBM invested around $750 Million US in providing Australia with blockchain, security, AI and more...what that all means I don't know but what I have been seeing is a lot of crypto buzz in Australia... now look I am not shilling this coin, I just found it today and am still researching it... but it has some legit ambition, has raised over 2x its soft cap in a bear market, and should have the same kind of "doesnt matter what the price is" sort of demand that BNB had due to its reduction in trading fees.... Help me find out if this is a scam or a good way to increase the number of bitcoins I have.
