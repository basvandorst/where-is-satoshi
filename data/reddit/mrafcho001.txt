Actually gold is not a very good conductor, copper is a much better conductor... [The reason Gold is used in electronics is because of it's corrosion resistance.](

Monero already has variable blocksizes that are really well executed, right? Seems like it is self-balancing, so the blocksize doesn't just explode due to spam.

I don't have any bitcoin accepting businesses in my area, but I'm curious, how does it work? Do you have to wait until transaction is confirmed? I can't imagine them holding up the line for 10 mins while the transaction confirms.

At least its not as bad as me **deleting** my 100+ BTC wallet, because it seemed like too much of a hassle to do anything with them at the time (1BTC &lt; $1).

Notice that they are riding fixies, so they can't coast or shift into a higher gear. They don't quite look like they are maxing out their cadence, but one can imagine a steep enough hill that results in an unsustainable cadence and detaching from the pedals would let them go faster.
Jumping back on the pedals is the real scary part with fixies.

I don't know the public address of the wallet :-\
Mined 150BTC (3 blocks) on a Pentium 4 (or possibly a multicore AMD processor... can't remember when I made the switch) in 2010 in a week or so. Turned off the miner because I wanted to play some video games and never started it again. Eventually deleted the wallet, because the hassle wasn't worth the few dollars the BTC was worth.

Why is he wasting our time with this? More genital mutilation or GTFO.

I agree with you on all points.
He got rid of an Audi R8 for the Lambo, so he's not buying this as his first racy car, nor is he doing it for the practicality of it. He is probably buying and selling expensive cars all the time, and the Lambo certainly has a lot of novelty. He'll probably be trading it in for some other equally fast and impractical car in a years time.
Everyone has hobbies and there is always people who think that hobby is a waste of time and money. If spending tons of money on cars brings this guy joy, then who are we to shit on him for it. Wish I had that kind of money to waste on ridiculous shit that makes me happy.

Nah, it's kind of like one of those high school memories where you make a fool of yourself and still feel super embarrassed about it 10 years later.
Chances are as soon as the value of those coins exceeded few hundred dollars, it would have been enough motivation to sell them.

I think they let in some starved coyotes after a while that make a mess of the chicken. Largest remaining part marks new price... or something, you gotta talk to the coyote guy to get the details.
