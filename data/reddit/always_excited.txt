It was a stunt. His friends sent him those bitcoins. They got sent within minutes of airing and the accounts those bitcoins were sent from are now completely empty.

Thanks for the reply. I just realized the time and was thinking about just reporting later.
I guess I don't really agree with the almost anarchy-ish side of bitcoin debate. I would like to elaborate on the third point a bit more though. People are naturally fearful when it comes to their own 'money'. I'm sure you are very aware yourself of how risky most people view bitcoin as. Where is that much needed trust/credit going to come from for bitcoin?

There's a [thread]( on this same subreddit. 
Here's the top reply  
20 BTC were received in 4 transactions that happened in a 2 minute window. It was probably him or some friends sending the bitcoins to make a big news story. No reason to stop that from happening!
That guy gets mad points for creativity.
