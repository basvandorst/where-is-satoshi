Very inspiring!  I have two questions:
Anonymous is clearly a big part of your choice in lifestyle, as it was the only word you bolded in your post.  Why is that so important to you?
It sounds like you got in early enough to provide yourself with a comfortable cushion, big congrats man! but here is a dilema i find myself in, as welll as im sure many other new comers to the party:
Why should I pay for my flights with bitcoin and pay instantaneously, when I could pay with my credit card and delay the payment, thereby holding my current btc amount and speculating the price will rise?

is it possible to do automated buys with GDAX?  that is the main reason i still use coinbase
@_date: 2019-04-15 22:16:57
CoinDCA.com is the single best way to do this.  Coinbase is awesome for automating dollar cost averaging, but the fees get expensive— especially in smaller consistent buy amounts.
CoinDCA allows you to do this for 0 fees, plus its free to use.

I had the same issue u/Darthbee
  
Check out [CoinDCA.com](  It connects with Coinbase Pro API to automate this.  Theres really two advantages that this combines.  
1) DCA is awesome with Coinbase because you can automate it.  I don't want to have to log in every day and do a purchase.  I want this streamlined so its automatically pulled
2) Coinbase Pro is better for making purchases, because you dont pay the ridiculous 5-10% fees.
What CoinDCA does is combine the two services essentially, so you are getting the automation via Coinbase, but making the purchases via Coinbase Pro.  All 100% automated to the rates you set.
Evern better— it's 100% FREE to use.  I stacked up a lot of extra sats by switching my automation to this.

Check out CoinDCA.  
If you are using Coinbase, this allows you to automate the DCA (much better so you don't have to think about it), but it connects with Coinbase Pro API so you don't have to be the insane 5-10% fees.  
Automation + maximizing your amount per purchase = winning  
Even better.. CoinDCA is FREE to use.

Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is one of the single best strategies you can do.  Instead of buying into the fomo, you can buy consistently over time and end up with more Bitcoin.  
If you're looking for a service, check out CoinDCA as a free way to automate this.  It connects with Coinbase Pro API so you can streamline it from your normal coinbase account.
  
Previously I was paying 5-10% in fees by automating my purchases, now I pay close to 0.
Plus its 100% Free to use.
@_date: 2019-05-14 23:35:06
Check out CoinDCA... it allows you to automate DCA, but without paying the 10% fees (assuming you are using Coinbase).  Also completely free to use.
@_date: 2019-05-14 23:42:58
Check out [CoinDCA.com]( as a way to automate this... assuming you are using Coinbase.  It connects with Coinbase Pro API so you get the benefits of automation + next to 0 fees.
  
I was previously paying 10% when using just Coinbase.  Service is 100% free to use too.
