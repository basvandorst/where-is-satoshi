Dogecoin is the largest of all these alt coins. It doesn't get any sort of bump at all from being frontpaged on You and I both know that. Further, we're all on the same team here. We're all in this together. There is no need for your separatism. Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin are in this shit together.
If this post was about Educoin vs Bitcoin, I would be more inclined to agree with you. That is one I also have some vested interest in, by the way. Something like 20 million of them or something. So if I was trying to bump a coin I'm vested in, this would be "Educoin and Bitcoin comparison" or even "Vertcoin and Bitcoin comparison". Also please note that I didn't link to their respective subreddits just now while making my point.

What if I told you dogecoin became something more than a joke the day it funded the Jamaican bobsled team? No? How about the Nascar? No? How about all the charity drives? Free dental for kids? Free helper dogs for disabled kids? Wells built in Kenya? What if I told you it is **the largest alt-coin** of all the alt-coins?
Yeah. It was a joke in its first couple of weeks. It's not a joke now. Its a fun crypto currency and you owe it some thanks, because its getting a lot of people into crypto currencies to begin with, which leads to more bitcoin users. Myself, for example.

So the way data is correlated in a word cloud is basically, the more often a word is used, the greater its weight in the cloud and therefore the greater its physical size in the cloud. Now, all this means is that the word "people" is used a lot on this subreddit. What that means to you is really just up to interpretation. Personally I find greater meaning in looking at both clouds as a whole rather than single words within them, which can easily be taken out of context and construed to mean well, almost anything really.

The sidebar quite literally refutes your point. This is not a post only about dogecoin. This is a 50/50 post. And if those same investors did not know about dogecoin by now then those investors haven't been doing a very good job because dogecoin is all over the place in the news and various community outlets. This is the biggest alt coin out there.
Like I said, if this was a educoin comparison, I might be inclined to agree with you (although according to the current rules, a 50/50 comparison with educoin and bitcoin would also be fair).

Fucking despicable that they put this up. It has that vibe of "see we found the guy on top in control heh" and tacitly mentions "he doesn't really control anything" to the reader, though that 2nd point is not driven into the readers mind nearly as hard as the first.

Reading my post now makes me feel like an asshole. Its not my points that I made so much as my tone. I apologize for my somewhat shitty attitude.


Hmm, fair enough criticism. How about we look at market volumes of the last 24 hours? [Here you go]( Note this image only accounts for currencies which are still mineable according to [coinmarketcap](


Its not an exception so much as a standard. Posts which are solely about a crypto coin for the most part are against the rules and get removed. Posts which are about bitcoin and something else are allowed. Its a simple rule. Just saying "no altcoin discussions whatsoever" is likely a more controversial one and was probably avoided for that very reason.

Litecoin is the silver to Bitcoins gold. Alt-coins are non LTC, non BTC. alt-coin majority trading is done within LTC and BTC markets. This is my perspective, anyway. Within that perspective, all non BTC/LTC coins are considered "altcoins". I'm sure not everyone will agree with my perspective, that's just the way I view it.
Edit: It should also be noted that Dogecoin is becoming an increasing contender with Litecoin for "2nd place". One prime example of this is the comparative subscriber counts in each respective subreddit. Dogecoin has a lot more. Litecoin however, is much more adopted as commercial means of transmitting value but to be fair to Dogecoin, its getting there and has come a long way in commercial adoption in its mere 4 months of existence.

It was something that had to be done sooner rather than later. What with the exploit in guessing block rewards allowing multipools to profit off the coin and negatively impact the trade value, I don't think anyone would want them to wait longer than they needed to.
The 1.5 client also sent out a warning to all users. In windows, it was a popup from the taskbar saying a 1.6 update is available and needs to be installed. I had read about the incoming patch the day it was posted, but didn't immediately patch my local wallet client because the fork wasn't coming for another 5+ days at that time.
The popup went out to all 1.5 clients a couple days ago. I don't know how it was handled for mac/linux users.

* Dogecoin is only 1 month old in reality and already accepted online at multiple webstores. You can buy everything from sextoys to computer hardware with Dogecoin.
* Dogecoin can't be mined with ASIC miners, therefore making it more available to the masses and harder for those of you with 100's of asic miners to get anything out of it. You have to go back to your radeon shelf rig and boot it up if you want some Doge.
How widely accepted was Bitcoin when it was **1 month old**? Not nearly as accepted as Dogecoin. Is dogecoins acceptability partly due to the acceptability of other crypto currencies? Of course it is. But this point still stands. It is also fair to compare dogecoins current age and acceptance with other alt coins.

And what of a world without banks? Where peer to peer financing has completely entrenched itself in society?
What of the world just before that, when there are few banks struggling to survive against the rise of crypto coins? Surely banks will be begging to take our BTC by then.

Andreas Antonopoulos disagrees with you. On a recent Joe Rogan podcast, he pointed out in the future the world will likely have 8 to 12 large crypto coins, each with a specific use.
Edit: I pointed this out because he is often referred to as the bitcoin ambassador. Funny how some of you are suddenly viewing him in a negative light just because he insinuated Bitcoin may not be the end all be all of crypto currencies.
Theres lots of room for multiple coins with multiple uses.

I.. What?
In the four months dogecoin has existed, it has: Sent the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics. Fully sponsored a NASCAR racer. Completed various charity initiatives including but not limited to: Free dental work for children, free training and acquisition of helper animals for disabled children and people, free water wells in Kenya. All of this, just off the top of my head. I'm missing *a lot of stuff* here. What has bitcoin done?
Doesn't sound very pointless to me. You sound like someone who has a bad taste in their mouth because they missed the initial boat on dogecoin. or is it that you only want your Bitcoin to succeed? Where has that attitude gotten you? We are all allies in this crypto currency thing, you know. People like you need to stop trying to draw battle lines. Its bullshit.
By the way: I buy bitcoin on a regular basis. I hold some bitcoin, some vertcoin and some dogecoin.

Everyone is downvoting you. I disagree with that as thats not the intention of the downvote button. I'd like to try and explain whats happening here. Story time.
A 9/11 truther told me once that it looked like to him the buildings were demolished with bombs. I pointed to the airplanes flying into the buildings, the gaping holes, the fires, even the fact that the buildings point of collapse (where they began to collapse from) was at the point of impact of the airplanes, not the basement as per the standard of real controlled demolitions.
His response was to move the goalposts and talk about how evil George Bush is and to assume that something wasn't fishy about 9/11 was to "bury your head in the sand".
Why do I bring this all up?
Because, what *he* thinks something looks like is very different from what the evidence tells us.
Now you have this kind of silly argument where your arguing with me about angles of words as if I had some kind of ulterior motive in creating them.
Guess what? I shared them. I know how to create them. I didn't make these word clouds. I had nothing to do with them. I know the website the creator used to make them, its very easy to use and I can tell just from looking at the images that he set both of them to random angle mode, which just chooses a fixed angle for you and does the rest automatically.
Sometimes, a conspiracy theory is just a conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:36:53
I would say it makes *very little* difference.
Dogecoin is huge. Its the largest alt coin of all of them. Its subreddit is poised to pass bitcoin in subscriber count. It has a big community behind it. There is one place Dogecoin is not going: obscurity and failure, like a lot of other alt coins.
You need to open your mind a little bit. I like the comparison myself of, crypto currencies today feel like the internet in 1998 or whatever. If you think this is some sort of publicity stunt, all I can do is say your wrong. I know you're wrong, because I'm the one whom posted it. I posted it to share it with people. Edit: Again, vested interest in bitcoin myself. I think we'll have a world with 8 to 12 prominent crypto currencies in the near future, Bitcoin and Dogecoin will be among the leaders of that world. Deal with it.
To say these people did not know about dogecoin before this post is ridiculous.
Further, seems apparent that the mods agree this post is both relevant and allowed here, because they did not remove it. it spent a full day at the top of Whats left? "You're wrong!" "No, you're wrong!". If that's the back and forth your looking for, you're going to have to go find someone else to have it with. I refuse to participate in a childish argument that wont lead anywhere productive.

I agree. As a supporter myself, one of the things I talk about when someone says "its a useless joke coin" is the *fact* that its the *largest* altcoin of all other altcoins. It has the largest community of all altcoins, if you exclude bitcoin and litecoin (may actually be bigger than litecoin already). Further, the amount of subscribers in its subreddit is second *only* to bitcoin, and its poised to pass even bitcoin on reddit in the near future.
As a shibe, I do take its value seriously. I also love the spirit and the drive behind the coin.
I am also vested in bitcoin and vertcoin. We are all allies in this.

To show you why this statement as earned you 22 downvotes and 4 upvotes, please allow me to share with you my latest doge tip bot history. You dont deserve the time it takes to take a screenshot, so you get a quote instead.
    Your current balance is: 3661.35129900 DOGE
    Your deposit address is: DK2cn1Unozy5wuCQGnYdbu11X9zuMA9scA
    You've tipped: 56385.13848877 DOGE ($38.48)
    You've been tipped: 3643.46528826 DOGE ($2.63)
And by the way, thats *current value*. Bitcoins were worth a dollar two years ago. Dogecoin is four months old and has the largest community behind it of any alt-coin out there. If you don't think that's going somewhere, you're delusional. Don't forget, I have vested interests in: Bitcoin, Vertcoin and Dogecoin.
I also gave away [Ð 25,000 on twitter]( and I give to a few causes on a regular basis. [Skeptoid]( for one, I've given at least 50k to.
I personally have hopes that 1 dogecoin will = 0.10 US (that is, 10 cents per Ð). If that happens, I'll be all the happier, knowing how much I gave away.
You know, you might have a point if I routinely tipped people 2-25 dogecoin. But I'm actually one of the guys that routinely tips ~1,000+ dogecoin. ~~So you really singled out the wrong fucking guy with your delusional bullshit. How fucking dare you call me a cheapskate? I don't see you handing out money over the internet like its a hobby -- **like I do**.~~
Not even bothering to mention various causes I have given to as well. This entire rant is only dogecoin related and only provides some examples of what I've given. The point is tipping in dogecoin is a big part of dogecoin. You can pretend it doesn't mean anything all you want but that wont change the fact that its here to stay.
