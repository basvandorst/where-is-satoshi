It's not irrelevant to those who lost money or to those who put their life savings, heart and soul into building something that is/was the company, and everyone attached to those people.

I'm in the same camp as you and my question is: If this is adoption, wouldn't that imply use? Right now we see limited use but so much hype in the media about price. I think this might be what is driving Joe Average to invest. Granted, Joe Average might make up a minority of new incoming money but I think they are all weak hands.

OP has stolen this content from JRE, which pays money to produce. OP doesn't care about bitcoin. They are just promoting their content-hijacking channel to make money.

I must have gotten into the game a few weeks after you. I just started 'hot' today.

Lightning vs. alt could end up like different versions of payment systems (debit card vs credit, etc.) but I think that eventually a few will become dominant. Unfortunately, the general public will want all of the inconvenience handled on the back end thereby favouring large corporations. Decentralization and disintermediation is nice in theory but the masses have proven time and again that they prefer convenience over autonomy.

"They mocked him in r/bitcoinmarkets...
They laughed at him in r/bitcoin...
But no one's laughing now at the one known as the 'bitcoin prophet' in May 2020..."

So can someone tell me if you can delete your account from an iOS app? All I see is an option to sign out.

I know! What's right do those filthy working class people have to a better life?

This was a tongue-in-cheek sarcastic remark poking a little fun at your comment about "just greedy working class people". To me, your comment came across as though you believe that working class people are 'less than' and don't deserve a chance at gaining from investing in bitcoin. 
Interestingly, crypto is a rare event where an emerging asset class was precipitated by retail investors.
If you intended this as a sarcastic comment, then 'whoosh' on my end.

How much do you think forums like Reddit represent overall market sentiment? There are so many more players out there who do not participate in Reddit such as institutional investors, Asian markets, etc. I ask because I would like to become better at gauging sentiment.

Good advice. How do you distinguish general fear from a 'falling knife'? Fundamental analysis?
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:06:20
No, only about 51% of them..

That was the funniest thing I've seen in a while.

You know, we can all type in large font, but that's just obnoxious. What makes you think your comment needs to be so much more visible than anyone else's? It's a nursery rhyme ffs.
