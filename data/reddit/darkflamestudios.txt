I've been feeling a lot of that regret. I have a lot of frustration with the state of the world and finances are stressful for everyone. You must be grateful for what you have, and know that every day you have opportunity to do more. I'm kicking myself a lot these days about the millions I see myself missing through hesitation or just not paying attention. I saw bitcoin back in 2011 but I didn't move on it until later. I should have been doing this right when it came out, but now is not too late. I'm sorry for your loss, I will remember him and I won't let my stresses overwhelm me. The love of money is dangerous. We all need to think, rather than "how can we get rich with bitcoin", we should ask "how can we help the whole human race with this technology?"

"The price of the digital currency bitcoin hit a two-year high Monday, trading above $700 for the first time since 2014, after it jumped 21% over the weekend.
The surge came days before an unusual event called the “halving,” an adjustment to bitcoin’s protocol designed to control the creation of new coins."
Question; when is the next time it halves?

Meanwhile the chartered banks are laughing at us because they issue new notes every 5-20 years.... and if you do a little research, just a few minutes at all, you will discover that Canada has had dozens and dozens of banknotes, all different, dating back 200+ years. Before that they actually had used playing cards as money in France.
"The Canadian chartered bank notes were paper money issued between 1817 and 1944 by private Canadian banks known as chartered banks. Notes were issued in a variety of different denominations, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 dollars."
Also according to Statistics Canada, the top Canadian Chartered Banks earned over 100 billion dollars in profit over the last 5 years.
What is even better is that "Canadian banks operate under a fractional reserve system, with 0% reserve requirement;"

From  ;
"Ethereum would never be possible without bitcoin—both the technology and the currency—and we see ourselves not as a competing currency but as complementary within the digital ecosystem. Ether is to be treated as "crypto-fuel", a token whose purpose is to pay for computation, and
is not intended to be used as or considered a currency, asset, share or anything else.
