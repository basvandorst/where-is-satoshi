"...these Terms of Service have three parties: you, BitGo, and either BFXNA or iFinex..."
As I read this, it means Bitfinex customers had a contract with BitGo. That means BitGo would have had to inform them about a change in the insurance.
Also, being insured is a major feature of a contract. I doubt that it can be revoked by simply sending a message "Hello, you have no insurance anymore. Have a nice day lol"

How can they decide this? A company can either pay what it owes or it is bankrupt. If it's bankrupt, than a liquidator will decide how to deal with the remaining assets.

This puts Bitcoin on one level with tech categories like smartphones and social media. But it is more like a brand with first mover advantage. More like Nokia then like smartphones in general. More like Myspace then like Social Media.
"Cryptocurrencies" would be an appropriate addition to this chart. Not Bitcoin.

That was an example of communication outside of BTC/LN. To trigger the other side to fund the channel. Because as I understand it, there is no such functionality baked into LN.

With 'fund the channel' I mean put BTC into it.

So the vendor and the bank have to create a contract via other means of communication first? A contract that states the vendor will send funds to the bank and the bank will put them into a channel to the vendor?

That sounds like for the vendors, the Lightning Network will be just like the pre-crypto days. They have to deal with (and are at the mercy of) big financial institutions.

Not sure what you mean. Setting up a node is not enough to receive payments. Someone has to put btc into a channel with you. The buyers won't do that. That would be more expensive then paying directly onchain.

Many consumers can buy from one shelf. But how would a node know how much funds to lock in the channel to the vendor? Even small onlineshops often make $100k/month. So how do they convince a node to put enough btc in a channel with them so that their business will run smoothly?

But how do they convince the well-connected node to put funds into the channel?

What do you mean by 'open channels with your biggest suppliers'? Send an email like 'Hello, please put $10k in a channel with us so we can receive BTC payments via your node. And please refund it every 24 hours. We have attached a PDF with a contract that handles all the details. As soon as you signed it, we will send the $10k to you so you can use these for the initial funding.'?
I don't think suppliers will dabble with that.

You mean a significant part of Bitcoin transfers already happens via LN?

I think there are over 50 million downloads of a new IOS version within the first 24 hours. So any new app Apple bundles with an IOS version will reach that goal within less then a day.
