Some people buy crypto on speculation. Some do research and buy because they believe crypto will change the world. Some read white papers, study reddit/slack channels and do their due diligence. And not all stock investors are as reasoned and wise as yourself cause If did they were, herd mentality wouldn’t dominate the stock market either.  There’s a lot of dumb in both. If there wasn’t in stocks, there wouldn’t be stock crashes like the dot-com bubble. Would there?

“Most people are buying Bitcoin, not because of a belief in its future as a global currency, but because they expect it to rise in value,” a note from economists at Capital Economics said on Wednesday. “Accordingly, it has all the hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble, which we expect to burst.”
Do most stock investors believe in the widgets companies they invest in make? Nope. Most stock so bought with the expectation it will rise. Therefore by this guy’s reasoning, all stocks have ‘all the hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble’.

I read his white paper in 2011.
I don’t think it’s wise to limit bitcoin or any crypto to SN’s original writings or intents. Steve Jobs originally didn’t intend Mac’s to have hard drives — that’s why he was fired from Apple. Henry Ford did not intend to make cars in colors other than black. Edison though his inventions should only run on DC current. Few inventions end up being used only as intended by their inventors. Don’t hamstring bitcoin to a paper written 10 years ago (eons in the cryptosphere). Bitcoin core dev’s certainly don’t.
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:57:05
That’s the issue: no investment will match the growth of bitcoin. Therefore there is no reason to cash out bitcoin for another investment unless the other investment exceeds the potential growth of bitcoin — like another younger crypto. Or it’s a no brained safe investment like real estate. Any other investment is just not smart business. I write this because people asking bitcoiners for investment capital happens all the time and rarely succeeds when people holding the bitcoin think it through.

I don’t know how the course is but a few years ago at JFK airport, I ran into a Princeton professor of Computer Science who claimed to be a authority on bitcoin.

The size of China's internal security apparatus is reportedly four time the size of the military. You do not want to go against the government if you are in china.

Same way Facebook and many other major western internet companies are banned and replaced in china by Chinese counterparts like wechat.

The article is about how the internet (electronic publishing, social media ) has demolished printed magazines. Not long ago, these magazines considered themselves untouchable and ridiculed online publishing, blogging and the decentralization of entertainment and written content. Now magazines are dying.

Chinese buying everything in your city is the outflow of money the Chinese government fears as it undermines the Chinese economy... which may be heading towards a 'hard landing' as they call it. And a hard landing can cause economic upheaval, which like I wrote, could causes serious damage. That is why the Chinese government wants to keep money in china, and that's why it's trying to seal of all exit channels... like bitcoin. You will quickly see a rapid drop of Chinese buying outside the Chinese mainland. China was recently investing heavily in Hollywood, and those billion dollar investments are quickly pulling back.

If companies can mine their blocks, then they can introduce double spends. Thus undermine the entire blockchain.

What could motivate me? I got into crypt when I bought BTC for $100 years ago. I understand crypto.
They way you and some people shit on IOTA is the way people shit on bitcoin when I first got in. No different. Bitcoin was called a scam incessantly. It used this weird, hard to comprehend innovation called a blockchain. It didn’t work the way people used to older tech expected, so they brutally ridiculed it with their expertise. Same goes these days for IOTA and their Tangle.
But the reality of bitcoin then and IOTA now is that if you take the time to understand the technology, learn how they are intended to work, and the growing ecosystems around them, you realize they are revolutionary and disruptive technology. And like all technologies in the early stages, they are flawed initially. These kinks get worked out. Btc is still battling out its kinks (like the fight over segwit and the blocksize limit).
So consider this advice from somebody who’s been in crypto for a long time... IOTA is not a scam. It is amazing tech with amazing (and everyday more mainstream ) minds building out the tech and infrastructure. IOTA has a strong potential to be the payment and secure communication protocol between the 100 billion IOT devices expected by 2025.
My guess from your writings is that you’ll disregard my advice. My friends disregarded mine when I first got in and laughed when mtgox imploded and blamed transaction malleability, accusing bitcoin of having a fatal flaw. They’re all regretting it now.

The author has valid points about famous people succeeding after failing. Big difference is that people he mentions, like Bill Gates, were never utter incompetents. 
Jesse Powell, the founder and CEO of Kraken used to tell of him rushing to Japan to try to fix MtGox during one of its initially disasters. While he and others were scrambling to keep alive the largest bitcoin at the point, Karpeles would sit on the floor, licking envelops to mail to people, totally clueless.

Ha! But how many Zimbabweans own crypto?

Guess you haven’t been around crypto long.

If there ever was a reason to avoid London Trust Media, this is it.

Sorry but you have no understanding of how bitcoin works if you think Coinbase can mine their own blocks.
Mining is a mathematical puzzle that the entire network races to solve first.

Still, next time he runs for re-election, Americans into crypto should help fund his opponent.

Becuase bitcoin works rock sold for 10 years. Lighting is still iffy.

I know that amazing story of the Code Talkers. My comment is regarding SN being connected to them and the hint being in the name.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:24:48
They’ve tried.
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:06:56
Interesting. Can you provide the link?
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:05:21
That’s a stretch

One man’s guess. We shall see...
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:16:37
Thanks for your opinion. We’ll see if it comes true. Though historically, people tended to err by underestimating bitcoin.

Whose ass did you pull these from?
