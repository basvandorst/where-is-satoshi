So bitcoin is useful because it makes defaulting on obligations easier?

Also, irrationally low. They somehow think that the "community" will self-regulate.

That's all well and good so long as there's largely parity between the different actors in the market. But in reality that's almost never the case, and a few large actors can tacitly cooperate for mutual benefit at the expense of the larger mass.

Yeah, fuck contracts! Why should I be obligated to do what I promised to do! Only the other guy should have to honor his end of the bargain!

Yes, a currency which can lose 50% of it's value in 24hours due to a DDOS is *definitely* the kind of thing you'd want to base a currency on.

Which means that bitcoins are just an extra transactional step in any exchange, and thus deadweight. Why go RMB &gt; Bitcoin &gt; RMB &gt; Product when you can just go RMB &gt; Product?

There are still opportunity costs.

You don't have a lot of something if you never spend it. And you can't spend bitcoins on much of anything, especially when one day their value can fluctuate massively.

It's screwed either way. It can't expand the money supply based on demand. It's basically like a currency tied to a railroad track. If anything gets in it's way, it's dead. Thing is, given enough time something is gonna block the way.
Hell, even gold would respond to demand to some degree. If gold got *too* scarce people would kill themselves trying to mine it and it would later increase. It was slow and inefficient, but it *did* respond to the market. Bitcoin can't even do *that*.

Bananas are a tangible good, not a currency. You can eat them, use them for decoration, a doorstop; whatever.  Bitcoins are only useful if you can trade them for something else. When you can't exchange them for something else, they are nothing.
Fiat currencies are backed by governments and are required to pay taxes. This forces velocity in the money supply and ensures stability. Bitcoin doesn't have *anything* backing it. If you made bananas a currency, you'd be a complete idiot. Hell, an even bigger idiot than if you made Bitcoins currency.

No doubt, I don't disagree that *technically* there's a finite supply of gold. I think a gold standard is a bad plan for that reason. That said, at least with gold extraction rates vary and there's little likelihood of actually *exhausting* the untapped gold supply in any reasonable timeframe. It's not very elastic, but it **is** elastic. It can respond to market demands.
So yes, gold is a bad currency, but bitcoin is an *idiotic* one.
