Buy on pumps with stop limits, and exit from the bad trades with stop loss to buy back more. And of course, when you are in profit - fix it :)

 *These predictions take several variables into account such as* ***volume changes****, price changes, market cycles, similar coins.*
I believe this is a not a full list of variables, but still doesn't contribute much into prediction, it also should include other variables like cumulative delta of asks and bids. But in reality any big whale can change the market situation in one minute. At the moment the market players accumulating bitcoin for strong bull trend by hitting stops of other players. I would say we will have way better results than this price prediction at the end of the year, or we fall miserably to 2-3k :)
**This is just my opinion and not official prediction**
