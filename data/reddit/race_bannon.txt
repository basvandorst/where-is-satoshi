I wonder how many times we'll hear this about the same numbers
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:05:42


You mean physically?  Sure.
In any other way, it's really not.  You spend money -- whether that's cash, bitcoin, or gold -- and you end up having something to show for it.  This is how the IRS got Al Capone...   If you're just hiding it and not spending it, then whether you rent a storage unit, dig a hole, or stick a USB in your pocket, it's all still pretty easy to hide.
But sure, on the rest that's a great argument against government controlled, centrally managed currency.

Wow, you must be a natural code breaker.  I bet you could get a job at in crypto.  Not many possess these skills

No way, the biggest joke of the article, aside from the entire premise itself, is:

I mean... flat earthers believe the earth is flat, and don't believe in gravity, apparently.  And that's today.

@_date: 2014-01-16 10:09:28
Wouldn't it work the same way any other currency would work?
For instance, if you bought a new TV at Wal-Mart on Monday.  Then the dollar went up by 20% on Wednesday. On Friday you returned the TV.  How much do you get back?  Would Wal-Mart calculate how much the dollar has fluctuated and give you the same value back?  
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:33:32


Fine.  But they still are.  This is akin to rappers and movie stars saying "I'm not a rolemodel."
We're taught not to judge books by covers, yet publishers spend millions on designing book covers.  Why? Because, no matter how much we know better, we still do it.  This isn't trickery or pretense.  This is accepting the nature of life and adapting to it.  Sure, free people wear whatever the hell they want.  And people will then assess them and treat them according to the way the present themselves.  
I'm not saying they should change themselves.  I'm saying we need to find people who are good at PR type stuff to fill that role.  
I'm also not saying I'm the man for the job.  Far from it.  I have a crazy beard, and am kind of eccentric.  I would go on there, and people would make the same assessment of it all based on me... which is exactly why I wouldn't go on shows advocating for Bitcoin.
One good candidate might be the Overstock CEO.  He has the look, the polish, and Joe Sixpack-recognizable credentials to be viewed as an expert.  He also probably has the motivation/incentive.
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:57:39


Well, this is fundamentally my issue with it. I actually thought both bow tie-wearers did well, and I liked all three quite a bit!  But when 2/2 male Bitcoin representatives show up sporting a style that is questionable at best, and has been out of style for decades at worst... well, yeah. It just distracts from the message. 
Let's just go ahead and create a new rule: Jeffrey Tucker is the only bitcoiner allowed to wear bow ties. ;)  
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:23:03
Oh yeah? That's cool.  I guess...
Thing is, though... When most people see bow ties they don't think Murray Rothbard.  They think the wearer is following in the sartorial footsteps of [Pee Wee Herman](  And [Tucker Carlson](  And [Bill Nye](  And maybe even [Steve Urkel](
And then they think, "if it's them smart nerdy types that use this newfangled bit money it's probably too complicated for me."  No matter how easy they claim it is.
See, when you go on a show to discuss Bitcoin, you're not just representing yourself.  You're not just representing the Bitcoin community.  You're representing the all of those things... but you're also representing the currency itself.  And you're representing all of those things to the public.  
*And the public doesn't know or give a shit who Murray Rothbard is.*
Even if they did, they wouldn't give a damn.  The public sees it and thinks "nerd/weirdo" wearing a bowtie, and then that idea carries over to the currency itself.
Want to see what the public trusts?  Look at what news anchors wear.  Look at what politicians wear.  Look at what salesmen wear.  You barely notice their clothes or their hair and that's the point.  You hear what they say and you're not distracted with trying to figure out WTF is going on with his wardrobe or elaborate facial hair.
The only person I've seen pull off a bowtie without a tux is [Nick Wooster](  And I suspect that almost no one in is Nick Wooster.  But, even if we all were... I guarantee you, if Nick Fucking Wooster himself was a guest on CNN the public would be wondering the same thing: what's with this guy's hair, bowtie, and mustache?  Instead of hearing what he had to say.  :(
@_date: 2014-05-14 10:59:08

Have you watched the *Behind the Curve* on Netflix?  Flat earthers come up with a test that will prove the Earth is flat, spend tens of thousands of dollars on equipment to do it, end up proving it's a globe, then reacting like "omg, what could these results mean? Better not share them, let's come up with new tests." *Then those tests proved a curve as well.* lol
Great thing about that though, you can do a lot of tests pretty easily and inexpensively in your backyard.  Even put a camera on a tripod and do a long exposure of stars.  
But... I'm about 399% certain you're just a troll anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:14:57
Already addressed this, dude. That’s a really expensive test to perform, which is why you’re choosing it. Since I’m not a billionaire, I’ll stick with the tests I can afford to do. Which I’ve don’t, and shared. 
Why don’t you rent a plane and fly to the edge of the earth and take some video?
Or... why don’t you actually respond to any of the points I make rather than continuing to respond with the same “make water stick to a ball” bullshit?  (I mean, I realize it’s because you can’t, and that’s the only one area you feel like you can win because no one you’ll ever talk to can afford to do it... but this approach is dumb (much like your belief in a flat earth) and disingenuous.

Open source means that the source code is open, it's freely available or distributed along with the compiled binaries.
The bitcoin software is open source, so yes.  It is.
The blockchain is open.  Anyone can see it.  But there could be plenty of closed source software that enables an open blockchain.  
In other words "open source" isn't the same thing as "open."  Open source specifically refers to source code.

I’m not the one claiming there’s an edge to the earth.  Plus, plenty of pilots fly around the earth all the time, and use great circle arcs to navigate — and actually make it to their destination. So, either the earth is a globe or they are *all* in on it. Every pilot, scientist, NASA employee, and so on — from every single country.  
Leading to two pretty interesting questions:
* Why would the hundreds of thousands of people in government and scientific research conspire to keep the earth’s flat nature from the population?  What do they gain?
*  Of these hundreds of thousands of people who would have to either have direct proof or access to evidence proving the conspiracy...  there’s never been a single leak of this evidence. Where’s the Snowden, or the Manning, or the Drake, or the Binney?\*
\* These are the US intelligence community members who leaked sensitive info within the last few years. Note that the US intelligence community is far smaller than the members necessary for the flat earth conspiracy to work, and it’s also citizens of one country.  And they can’t keep a secret.

Hahaha!  Man, you're great.  Honestly.  
This is one of the best troll accounts I've seen in a while.  You stay in character, you avoid any reasonable progress in the conversation, you take hilariously bad stances on issues, and just keep plowing through.
The only real constructive criticism I can provide is that it'll be more convincing if you put a little bit more into the replies.  Looking through your comment history I just see the same thing over and over:
* "Spin a ball globetard"
* "The Lightning network is a scam"
* "I hate Elon Musk"
* "gravity"
And so on...  It's obvious within a few "next" clicks on your profile that it's all low effort trolling.  It's funny, but I feel like you could do so much more.

I’ve confirmed it using several tests, most devised by flat earthers. All of them proved a curve. You’re intentionally choosing a test that can’t be recreated at this scale because any ball with sufficient mass to have a gravitational field would be either huge or a black hole. I’m sure you realize this, of course, and that’s why you’ve chosen it. Go test shining a light over a distance, ignoring curvature — or any other number of tests that are easy and inexpensive.

Not at all. I've looked into it considerably, both sides of it.  But I've also learned that there's just never enough evidence either way for the ones who *really* want one of the outcomes to be true.  I mean, even GoPro footage showing curvature, the failed light experiment, and on and on...  Just countless of them now.
I know Alex Jones offered to fund a show where flat earthers try out all their experiments.  I'd love to see that.  Jones is kooky af though.


Hey, just by the way, "you're" is a contraction of "you are."  That's what the apostraphe does there, it replaces the "a."  So what you said there is:


This almost sounds as silly as the other things you say!  :)  
"Your" is the possessive form.  And thanks!  Always nice to hear my ass is cute, no matter how many times I hear it in a day.


Anyway, it's super cute how you keep trying to be bossy and rude toward me -- I guess because I don't believe the same thing as you.  Reminds me of a super "vicious" tiny chihuahua, but an ultra religious one.

I understand that digital currency was talked about, and even used to some extent at the time.  I'm pointing out that nothing in the image is remotely related.


And yet they didn't. 


So the whole topic of this thread is a joke?  I guess I got then. But mainly by the fact that OP and several others in the thread is taking it as a serious prediciton, and even talking about price predictions.

It's not tied to some amount of gold anymore, but the US has 8,000 metric tons of gold reserves.  As of today, this is like

Are you talking about changes in exchange rates?  That's not the same as interest.


Yeah... because you're not getting a loan, you're counting on the value of the cryptocurrency increasing.


From what I can tell, nothing you've said has had anything to do with loans?

Was it his Rich Dad?  Or his Poor Dad?
In *Rich Dad Poor Dad* he talks extensively about how his biological father was poor, but his friend's father was rich and taught him how to invest and make money.
At no point is it ever discussed how the man supposedly made all this money -- except through book sales.
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:30:35
What?  Loans... safe, insured custodianship... facilitating transactions... c'mon man.  Do you think banks care what currency they use or whether it's fiat?  
For a *long* time banks issued their own currencies.  With crypto, they will again.
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:03:37
Yeah, exactly.  I didn't even consider that he might have meant the identity of the creator(s).

Sure, there have been tons over the, what... millenia? 
I linked to several that work quite well, but obviously as with businesses, relationships, currencies, countries, random cryptocurrencies, and probably everything else there are more failed attempts than there are successes... but the successes matter.
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:50:49
I mean... unless they mine crypto or issue their own currencies... 
Also worth noting: banks have historically issued their own currencies.  For centuries.
@_date: 2019-05-01 02:23:11
No, of course he's not wrong. I'm just saying it's obvious, trite, basic advice.  That's the summary of *Rich Dad Poor Dad*.

The same function is performed though.  You don't need a town crier for rapid news dissemination today, because the same effect exists in different forms.
Loaning money, facilitating transactions, safe and insured custodianship, and other bank functions have existed for a long time and will continue to exist for a lot longer -- whether you call it a bank or not.  Note: Coinbase is a bank.

@_date: 2019-05-09 15:21:00
What are you talking about, don't you know that John McAfee is a cyber legend?  He's been in cyber security for 132 years, and if you google cyber legend, he's what comes up.  He doesn't need to get a tattoo.  He'll just take some drugs, and get hookers to pee on him while he "meditates" on it, and the BTC will be returned by a whale as he swims out naked into the ocean.

Not that they did in this case.  This is a conspiracy theory from ages ago.  But still
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:48:50


What banks?  Central banks?  Or are you talking about my local Washington Mutual branch, or whatever?


I mean... what are stablecoins?  Expect this trend to grow, evolve, and change over time but there's a current example already of bank-issued crypto.
Banks and other financial institutions existed before fiat currency, and they'll exist after it.

When Werner Herzog said he'd eat his shoe, [he did it](  But you can't expect a man like John McAfee to live up to a man like Werner Herzog.
@_date: 2019-05-13 05:30:45
Yeah, extremely accurate right now.
And he does have something of a point with the "who's behind it" part... it's just that most of the Bitcoin community realizes we don't need anything behind it.  Most people aren't there yet

Well, (1) he's not a billionaire.  He made like $120M, then lost almost all of it.  (2) Accumulating wealth *can be* an indicator of intelligence, and one of character.  But it doesn't mean it has to be.  I've seen a lot of idiots inherit money, win money, and earn money, but I've never seen many idiots *keep* money.  McAfee has at least managed to hang on to some of it.  
The guy's obviously not an idiot.  Scam artist and huckster? Definitely.  Russian agent of influence?  Maybe.   Murderer?  Probably.  Absolute lunatic?  Obviously.
Idiot?  Almost certainly not.

I mostly see Korean and Chinese companies collaborating.  It's fun seeing the two signs in two languages over the same restaurant:
"Chinese Restaurant" in English, and "한국 식당" in Korean (meaning "Korean Restaurant")
