I've got a transaction out there that I put a .0002 fee for a .0295 transaction, been sitting in limbo for about 9 hours
Another is for .0296 with a .004355 fee, sitting for 24+ hours

What did you do?
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:34:09
You've got 2 confirmations now, should be good

That would be about the only way not to pay fees, if you send the coins from one wallet to another, fees are required, especially with the current transactions in the mempool
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:53:42
Wait for to hopefully drop from the mempool and be returned back to the original address, then pay a fee like everyone else does

Sorry, needed an extra 0, it should have been .0004355.
I use the Blockchain wallet for my normal daily stuff

Where is the coinbase lady at now?
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:06:30
And they used Coinbase...

I expect it to take off similar to what an IPO would. If it does would it be a smart idea to drop $100 or so into it?

Based on my novice knowledge, bitcoins price is set by the people selling it, and the people buying it.
For instance, if you have a bitcoin and wish to sell it, you post a sell order at, let's say 100 dollars. If a buyer puts in a buy order at 100 dollars then your sell order will fill, and your bitcoins will go to the seller, and you will get the dollars they paid, minus fees.
If someone else posts a sell order for less, let's say 99 dollars, it's likely that their order will get filled before yours.
The price you see reported by exchanges are a reflection of the average price of filled order over the last X minutes.
Edit: of course I may be completely mis-informed, hopefully someone will confirm/deny my statement.

In coinbase they could setup an automatic transaction to buy a certain amount of bitcoin and place it in your wallet

And a follow up question, how soon after the etf approval can we expect to see it on traditional markets such as scotttrade or etrade?
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:35:37
I meant more the price of the etf itself
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:16:49
yup 
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:51:34
Has anyone ever even used bitsqyare?
