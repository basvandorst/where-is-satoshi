100%. I can't believe that he can get away with something that actually hurts the company, but I guess as the CEO he has a lot of leverage.

Alt coins not performing that great anymore so people going back to BTC

Relax they are insanely busy, give them time.

We should really urge Coinbase to not list Bcash, only thing it does is to bring confusion. 
Hopefully exchanges at some point will start delisting Bcash.

The guy is a scumbag and pure cancer for the crypto scene, I really can't believe anyone supports him.

Super bitcoin and BitcoinX forks has happened. None of them are legit.

I love a little dip. It rinses out the weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:53:25
On some exchanges it did. On Binance it hit $2507

Most would definitely be ok with a bandaid fix right now.
If LN is still more than a year away from full implementation then we really need a block size increase - Desperate times call for desperate measures!
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:45:04
It will if a scaling solution gets implemented soon. But it has to be fucking soon and not in a year...
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:21:25
i have $40K i'm gonna throw into BTC as soon as the clock hit 12!

How does large sized transactions happen? I thought each transaction has around the same size.

one day 1 satoshi = $100M.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:39:52
something like that and make sure you can't mess or duplicate the coin without breaking it

If you know the traits and characteristics of a psychopath I would not be suprised if all 3 of them are psychopaths.
I am not even kidding...

What prevents the mempool from tx and fees increasing more and more with only 300kb blocks. It looks like the mempool can barely keep up with the current amount of transactions.
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:46:57
Post the transaction ID

As long as you have access to the private key, all you have to do is move your bitcoin address to a wallet that supports B2X.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:36:26
But from what I can read Bitcoin core refuse to increase the block size but i'm not sure why?
Also how much would the block size need to be increased for us to see a huge reduction in the transaction fees?
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:47:43
Hmmmm so if we keep the blocksize low people will use the lightning network, that is very interesting and might actually work.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:27:28
Those guys are pure scumbags, all of them should be locked up

Right now BCH is 100% following the price of BTC. When BTC goes down BTH goes up. When BTC goes up BCH does down. BTC just need a steady rise and BCH will drop back down below $500.
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:33:26
it's good but also means that we probably have to increase the blocksize to 2mb soon
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:26:44
Right now I wish S2X wasn't canceled...
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:53:27
$384,400 is the moon

Why BCH will never replace BTC: 
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:26:49
100% agree.

Marvel's Agents of SHIELD is one of the most watched series in the entire world.
Many millions of people will see that bitcoin logo and many millions of those people will investigate into how they can buy bitcoin. This is extremely bullish news for bitcoin!

I hope that is not true.
Twitter banning crypto ads is a good thing.

I wonder how well a gpu card will perform gaming wise once it has been used for mining. Much lower or about the same as a new one?

Kraken said they are very willing to auction the remaining BTC so that they won't get dumped directly into the market.
Hopefully that will happen.

Bitcoins ETF's and we will be there in no time.

So Robinhood don't even buy any coins as backing? Why would this even be good for bitcoin?
