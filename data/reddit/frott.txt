It is a viable currency. So is carrots and punches in the face. Define what you consider viable. Do you mean its volatility makes it unviable?
You mean popular, correct?
Because it could stay about as popular as it is now, and it would still be useful as it is now. A government "pushing it underground" would be internet censorship at a massive scale, and it would tip the hand that yep, our governments will do that. They'd have bigger issues on their hands at that point, if they want to maintain power they're going to have to loosen up on wealth.
I think the answer to your hypothetical is "they can't push it anywhere, that's how they will let it succeed."

lol sieze his computer.
yes because they're going to backtrace all of the info and triangulate on him via their satellite lasers, right?
or, they'll have a bunch of fake info and something like 1mkkd0193kfm109c9c1m029mdf01m919m92 written on paper and sit there staring at the transaction in the block chain with hands up like "LOL DUNNO."
To put it in perspective, if the OP could actually do anything that means that anyone could claim the same thing on legit transfers. Would a warrant to search for the headphones that OP actually did get pass? Never.
If it was that easy, it would happen both ways. But you can only try and see what happens. This stuff needs to get established and precedent formed.
But the ENTIRE POINT of this is that it is unregulatable, and only superficially tracable. And even if you embed some sort of "proof" into the transaction, you'd need a trusted 3rd party to verify both ends of the transaction. Gosh, sounds like banks.
@_date: 2013-03-29 05:38:09
that was my point: people will opt in to trusting a third party. 
"And they're like 'hey, we've got our own shit... and you can opt in to use Chase Preferred RockefellerCoinz safely and guaranteed if you just give us personal infos."
I mean, the vast majority do that already. Maybe the banks will change how they work to accomodate cryptocurrencies.

You've not put in enough research if you're asking "if it is worth it"
Are you talking about buying bitcoins so one day they're worth way more LOL PARTY TIME BRO?
Or are you asking if economic freedom in an unregulated, decentralized money system is worth it? Because that's a valid question too, but I don't think that's what you're asking.
Someone who believes the second question's answer is yes, will likely say the first one's question is yes also.
Now ask yourself, if you could spend bitcoins anywhere you wanted, and it wasn't regulated at all, would you then do work and prefer to take bitcoins as payment? Because besides "breaking laws" you should want that. The issue then becomes, well, if everyone suddenly uses bitcoins how do taxes get paid? oops infrastructure awk warrrrd

Bank of America coins CAN work, they just wouldn't be anonymous and they'd be regulated. 
The major difference is when BOA pulls a Cyprus they couldn't touch your coinz. 
It also couldn't be a fractional reserve system where they promise they have your coinz and you can take them whenever you want but then if everyone did that AWK WARRRRRD the bank would fail. they wouldn't be able to limit your pool.
 If they could, there'd be no point to mimicking bitcoins... its the same as banking is now.

Point re carrots and punches is that anything is a currency. You have to define viable. Food was currency at one point, I can invent situations where a punch in the face goes on a tally and is redeemable for something (BDSM?)
There were already "virtual currency marketplace" laws passed, early CIA briefings with the scientists who are a part of the bitcoin project, all public, and gov vendors using bitcoins to pay off taxes and such. I'm not sure I'd want a government datafile on me with a checkbox next to "uses bitcoins"
A good number of reddit, 4chan and wordpress users know about bitcoin. How much of the internet does that cover?
It's decentralized, anonymous currency. They can do no more vs. it than they can vs. other P2P anonymity devices aside from directly dismantling the internet for the common folks. The people who do that will simply cease to be reelected for those who will support it. 
If there's a commercial outcry to support it, it will thrive. The problem here is when the outcry is to support something that is essentially harmful to commerce. 
One bit that gets lost in the anti-centralized financing / political rhetoric is that taxes and regulation are there for the end-user's benefit, they're not arbitrary punishments.

They'd also know nothing would stick at all, which is entirely the point of bitcoin.
A technology that is unregulated and anonymous is developed to undermine "the authorities" ruffles certain jimmies: spoiler, the authorities'.
In the wild fantasy that is the endgame of bitcoins, people would only exact vigilante justice. Or, it becomes regulated somehow, either informally via "social media web of trust sites... lol, so easily scammable" or via "authorities."
But see, we have a system already that regulates money and protects against these sorts of things, we just don't like protecting it when they get overly greedy. That doesn't mean all banks are the same...
I'm all for bitcoin, love it. but also love it in a "i can't see how this would ever be feasible long-term in its current state without devolving into rogue, mafia enforcer conditions of like prohibition US or something."

Try flagging down a cop and explaining "uh well you see Bitcoin is a revolutionary cryptocurrency..."
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:08:52
that's a moot point, there are a bunch of other cryptocurrencies and none of them have had the staying power, or in the case of those built on same codebase/idea uniqueness.
Friendster failed because they didn't know how to code, and every page load it would recalculate the degrees of separation and brought the servers to a grinding halt (which i think were running in a bedroom literally LULLL)
facebook did it right, when facebook began you could only make an account if you had an affiliation to a company/school/certain groups. This got them a segmented sample audience and didn't try to do a site that was immediately for everyone with no venture budget.
remember mplayer and gamespy? when new tech came around they changed and the competitors won.
bitcoin has no scalability "upgrade" to be made that hasn't been thought of, as tech advances it actually makes bitcoins more feasible, not less.
for example, 
~the entire us goes fiber... verifications/transfers happen faster. 
~hard drives get bigger... storing blockchain becomes trivial
~better serverside tech... exchanges stop being laggy pieces of shit
~new deepweb... new channels for bitcoin to run on, skirting regulations further
if you take the criteria, there's really no better way to do it right now or with any forseeable tech changes... anonymous, peer verified, completely open transaction list, anti-inflationary, self-correcting.

transaction on the blockchain is about as much a smoking gun as a call traced to a burner cell phone.
good luck escalating it to the point that you'd ever be able to link him to an address legally. Even if you wrote his name, PGP key, and a jpg of his face to the transaction, it isn't proof it was meant for him. Anyone could do that.
That's how man in the middle attacks generally work, in fact. 
1. AAA offers to wire BBB $500 for 5 bitcoins.
2. BBB agrees and gives BBB info to AAA
3. AAA offers to sell CCC PalmPilot for $500, requests to be wired the funds.
4. CCC agrees, AAA gives CCC the info for BBB
5. BBB receives $500 from CCC without knowing who it came from
6. BBB gives AAA 5 bitcoins
7. AAA DISAPPEARS SANIC GOTTA GO FAST
best case scenario here is that chargebacks occur but in the end AAA gets the coins and people go "hey that guy is a hacker!" and scowl
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:04:07
There are facets to this, though. The underlying concept is what it is, but will bitcoins necessarily be "the one" eventually?
People get excited about it's lack of regulation, but will people eventually opt-in to trusted regulatory services, snowballing into "non-regulatory services are not to be trusted as there is a risk?"
Did the gnarly dudes who invented currency go "ok, this is the currency for once and for all?" Or did they get excited like "wow, currency!" 
Huge distinction here. Imagine tomorrow there is RockefellerCoinz and they've been mining privately for years to gain the lions share of the wealth. And they're like 'hey, we've got our own shit... and you can opt in to use Chase Preferred RockefellerCoinz safely and guaranteed if you just give us personal infos. but it's not required, but good luck if you choose to not use it!'
things such as storing the block chain lead to non-consumer-friendly requirements, unless you use trusted 3rd party methods of negotiating it. Which are guaranteed or insured again, please remind me?
So while I agree that this sort/type/category/class of thing is definitely in the future, thinking it is necessarily bitcoins is like saying the only portable mp3 players in the future are iPods.
Especially now that people are treating it like a commodity or stock and the vast majority of the transactions are to make profit with the bitcoins themselves, and not actually using them for anything, most folks see it - thanks to press largely - as "buying coins as an investment against the future value of coins."
Otherwise, it's really just a waiting game of "how long til it isn't so volatile that you could end up paying $10,000,000 for a reddit gold subscription."

Problem here is that the only wire fraud that is pursued involves more than a pair of headphones.
Pursuing, arresting and convicting someone and putting them in jail costing infinitely more money than the headphones, ain't gonna happen.
What does happen is when someone makes millions off of it, or has assets to seize. The politics are simple. The powers that be will not be in the job if they use Company assets to catch the headphone thief. They take down the big fish and that's when the press conferences are trotted out.
If anything, this sort of thing is a black eye and politico fodder "its a plague like drugs! common thugs can do this and it isn't profitable to pursue each individual case."
What would occur is some sort of action vs. the bitcoin network. It would be like having a raid on the house of someone who buys $10 of heroin, or even the dealers / drops / lookouts at this point instead of the distributors.
Just doesn't happen at this scale.

" I can't see the internet bringing down modern democracies."
Modern democracies use mouthpieces and figureheads at a very granular level. 
With 100% internet saturation, we could essentially vote on the issues and legislation directly, rather than needing those people in office. That would kill lobbyists off, reduce government drastically. People would create policy directly rather than picking someone arbitrarily because they "agree the most" with them. There wouldn't need to be party lines anymore since everyone is really a mish-mash of beliefs.
Most importantly we'd get rid of this rather "samey" choice of parties. Some think both parties are essentially neo-conservative, others neo-liberal. Every election cycle they try their best to showcase the parties as opposites on a spectrum, when they're actually rather close to each other in general when it comes to issues of power or finance.
social issues? Pffft. they're the elite ruling class with differing religious and social stances. big deal.
Anyway, the assumption here is that the government isn't allowing bitcoin to happen for a good reason. for all we know there are still some forces working from within trying to extract the bankers ;)
they'd get far more votes than those who supported the bailouts for certain banks while other banks suffered because they didn't "gamble"

I went and saw a band two nights ago and it was a bunch of kids born in 1991 playing grunge, wearing flannel and all.
gen x had the biggest music revolution, the last era of "no social media to be social" and the real 80s kids who went from 8-bit to 16-bit and so on. Our high schools had less than 1% of the students aware of what computers were, not 100%. Beepers segwaying into non brickbox mobile phones into smart phones. 
vinyl and tapes into cd players, portable even... mp3 players. then into internet massive pool
recording equipment costing thousands upon thousands for low rez / junk to pristine digital audio for cheap. CRT monitors to LED.
books into pdfs, expensive printing into self publishing on the cheap.
phone line internet to perma internet to fiber and wifi
analog to digital cameras. video recording on VHS to credit cards or porno glasses recording wirelessly.
mice with balls to lazerz, 
we are the last generation to collect things, real things, and so we went from all the things we cared about requiring work and being rare to being instant, available and cheap.
We're on the hinge of all this, been on both sides of the fence. The new generation can't appreciate it at the same level because they didn't have to go to a store to see what exotic imports from other cities IN THE US made it in there in any regard (books, software, computers, games, music, movies)...
...and the old generation must feel like you're straight up on permanent acid
