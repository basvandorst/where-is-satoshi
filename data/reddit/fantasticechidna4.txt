Number of transactions is not the same as number of payments. You can have a mega transaction that makes a lot of payments to many people, and of course that will pay a huge fee. For example an online wallet aggregating many withdrawal requests in a single transaction.

They probably will let you go with 0 confirmations because it's just a lemonade. Who's gonna be scamming kids over a lemonade with bitcoin? And the idea of paying with LN is that you already have a channel open when you go shopping.

the validating nodes allow miners to assign to themselves a reward, which are newly issued bitcoin, but only of a determined amount. They can award themselves less, but not more than what is allowed.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:59:11
lol why would you trust a stranger on the internet?
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:28:54
but it is prone to human error. devs can push a bug and open the door for printing trillions of bitcoins. so maybe you can say that the more time code is in the wild that it is less likely to have bugs, and that more recent versions are more vulnerable to human error?

you can have tor to hide your node and use -listen=0 to avoid external nodes to connect to you. 
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:13:00
you can set up a tor node. it will hide the fact that you are using a bitcoin node and with tor you dont have to configure any ports.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:02:14
that's not the whole point of open source. even if you don't know how to compile code the code is open for more knowledgeable people and they will alert the community if there's something dangerous with the code. with closed source we don't know if the code is data mining your transactions and selling it.
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:49:18
if it wasnt secure it couldnt be used as money to begin with. maybe you could say the uncensorable part is the inherent value and it only applies if you use bitcoin correctly.

so for the attack to work you have to be using the noinput in the wrong case *and* reusing addresses *and* being given different same value outputs? damn that's bad luck! sorry!
but if the noinput thing is only to be used within channels, then it is a good thing that the dasjr dude is making that shitty wallet, because it means miners can't correlate noinput wit lghtning transactions- maybe it's a dumb guy using dashjr crappy wallet or the man himself. or maybe they cant correlate in the frst place?

I've read some people saying that a mix round happens once per hour. so better if you can leave your laptop for hours in public wifi. windows is more vulnerable to malware, spyware than linux. windows is also a closed source OS. most likely it has NSA backdoors in it. but no os is secure if you dont use your common sense. wasabi uses tor by default. if using tor from home is not an option for you use public wifi plus a paid vpn you trust. expressvpn is good.

the wallet must have a support team or a support forum at least. that means someone is actually using that wallet and someone cares about user opinions (officially managed). I put up a list of must have wallet features.

any privacy improvement in the wire is good no matter you are connecting remotely to you own server or to someone elses'. if you want to protect people with privacy you don't do so by appealing to good will and diligence because that way things don't change because people don't change. it is better than bloom filters then it's a good thing. what people will do is install updates like zombies. so presenting neutrino as an update is for the greater good and that's it.
if there is a breach in the wire security then neutrino will add a layer of protection.
I think Nicolas sin is wanting 'perfection' when 'better' is available.


I agree. I think a case should be made that SPV is intended to connect remotely to your own node only imo.
I LOLd at the NPC SPV users.

you can use bitcoin core full node just for state and then use any wallet you want on top of it. coinshuffle wallet? sure. hellokitty wallet? of course. that lessens the burden of development so core devs can focus on other things.

there's this thing in bitcoin called 'economic majority'. The economic majority has a saying in bitcoin's protocol decisions. By using centralized wallets the users are giving away the power bitcoin gives to them to these centralized institutions. so yes fuck all exchanges. use them to buy and move away immediately the coins to a wallet connected to your own node and which lets you own the keys. that's the basic nature of bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-03-11 12:04:08
I've seen many developers that know nothing about user experience selling features and user experience as if they were not connected, for example people that demand granny friendly wallets and they get answered that features come first. I've also seen some companies that are not privacy friendly trying to sell privacy features to wash the company face, but in reality they make it difficult to get to those options (google changing all the time the account dashboard), or they bloat it with a million privacy switches (as microsoft does in win10 privacy section of the settings, because it puts additional work understanding what each option means). I think we should be careful not to do the same with crypto wallets (by mistake maybe) because they are privacy critical.
they fuck up privacy as I said


most users will trust the wallet if they sell it as privacy friendly because they expect a finished product so it is harmful that in reality additional steps are required to achieve real privacy. In my opinion wallets should be as private as possible by default and give no privacy options to the user.
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:19:48

Both rhetorics are wrong. The goldman sachs dude said in an interview that crypto takes the burden of having to store piles of cash away like in that breaking bad scene.

privacy tech exists that allows you to transact privately by default and at the same time allows you to disclose payment data selectively, in which is called selective privacy. Some privacy altcoins have that feature. So it is possible to do that, but holding public organizations accountable is a problem different from privacy, as they can also evade responsibility by using fiat or other dirty tricks. Privacy is a right regardless of criminals being also able to take advantage of it, the same way they can take advantage of cars, knives, encrypted chat messaging, etc. justice has many ways to apply enforcement other than reduce the rights of the law abiding majority.

depending on the value of the item you want to wait for more or less confirmations. for example if you re selling a house or a car you want to wait 6 or more confirmations. or if you are selling bread and butter you can wait just 1 confirmation. but never accept 0 confirmation payments and do not trust companies that sell you confidence on 0 confirmation.
the blockchain is slow and intended for big payments and cold storage backups. if you want instant settlement for everyday payments use lightning network.

kyc in an exchange wallet has effects beyond the exchange wallet. it is actually worse than I put it.
@_date: 2019-03-30 09:15:35
many rules are taken into account by full nodes to determine if a transaction is valid or not. One of those rules checks that the transaction is not a double spend. Imagine one satoshi only. You can trace the history of each satoshi since it was mined. Each satoshi has a history that can be traced back to a mined block (satoshis are issued as a reward for miners that solve a block). The way satoshis are transferred (spent) is by creating transactions that have inputs and outputs, for example input from transaction pointer (TXID xxxx Output  that means output number 0 from previous transaction which hash id is xxxx) to address B. That transaction is included in the blockchain. When a node receives a block with that transaction it checks that the satoshi was not spent from any other transaction pointer already, because all coins being spent have to come from an unspent pointer (or UTXO, Unspent Transaction Output). Outputs can be any amount of satoshis but I preferred to explain one satoshi (the basic unit) so you can see the precision at which things are checked. If ALL transactions in that block pass the checks they are included in the local blockchain of the node and it becomes consensus.

for  I would be happy if the wallet at least says 'ongoing payment' but not even that, I saw no message. At first at the payments list it says 'pending' for a long time for a LN payment. Then it fails with red screen and pic errors and at the payment list the payment message updates to 'failed' for that payment. When I reattempt paying to the same invoice the 'failed state message' doesnt update to 'pending' again, which would be the expected thing, and the wallet doesnt add any new payment list item for the new payment attempt, so for me the experience was the payment seems lost in lightning limbo.
@_date: 2019-03-13 10:52:19
it is possible. what you are asking for is called pay-to-many or batching and some wallets are looking into that

one confirmation means your transaction was included in a block. two means a block was linked on top, and so on. so if you just need your tx confirmed you need one confirmation. if you need more confirmations know that it takes 10 min per confirmation. so 6 would take on avg 1 hour if your fee is succulent for miners.
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:44:03
"$" can be confusing because as we all know it is used among many currencies like [Mexican peso]( that's why I tend to use "usd." as well. for a global currency as bitcoin I think avoiding complications is better. what will happen is people will start drawing the op symbol as "$" over time out of laziness.

because the nodes accept the chain of blocks that has the most cumulative computing difficulty. miners and nodes send all the solved blocks to the network. as long as a node is alerted of a new block, it validates it and adds to their local chain.
because the rules are the same in all nodes. then they agree on a common history. if a competing block arrives with more computing power, it will replace the past history, but that usually doesn't happen with many blocks and one block at a time is the usual.
it all relies in relating computer energy expenditure to deterministic math function outputs. bitcoin trusts the chain with most energy spent creating it.

When you send money you have to get the money from somewhere, those are the transaction inputs aka the coins that you are spending. The outputs are a little program that locks the coins to the new owner, or the change back to yourself. So you say a transaction has inputs and outputs. Iirc a typical transaction has one input and two outputs, but it can have as many as you want (but your fee will increase).
@_date: 2019-02-23 22:34:29
I agree sortof and I think that we should also question every 'community proposal' as yours. So I'll start with you. I don't think that we need to actively try to break it, that's the job of hackers. Normal users just need to choose products that fulfil their purposes whatever they might be. Some may use bitcoin for the freedom it gives, some to speculate on the price. It's a natural process.
If you're a UI designer, a dev, etc, someone that offers a product or service you just compete and win by merit. There is no place in a free market within bitcoin ecosystem for political action because bitcoin self regulates. And your proposal sounds like a political call. Those that fall on the convenience of custodial services, for example, will learn not to trust other people with their money when the service gets hacked.

why do you think there's a limit to begin with?
@_date: 2019-02-02 12:08:58
you don't understand the concept. when you mix the coins they cannot be traced back anymore if the mixer does the job. you don't know what coin you "get". they cannot be linked.
every bitcoin transaction creates *new* coins (UTXOs, nothing to do about inflation). what happens in a mixer transaction is that those new coins are not connected to the previous wallet they came from. watch some youtube videos on the matter some are good!


It is, as I wrote, about that you can receive mixed coins back which are linked to illegal activities.
you are contradicting yourself here. *linked* and *traceable* are cause and effect. when a mix happens the link is broken and the coins cannot be traced anymore.

your wallet was allowing an unauthorized entity (google) to access the users seeds. I dont care if google was reading or not. it is a bug because that is not intended software behaviour. of course you can wishy wash things. but facts are facts.

Wasabi already uses neutrino. neutrino afaik has nothing to do with lightning, just a more private way for your wallet of learning transactions and can be used by any wallet. but checking your own full node is still the most private way.

@_date: 2019-02-09 20:00:38
see my comment here 
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:38:07
but it has to be a miner that has started mining on minute 10 right? because afaik miners pick the transactions they wanna include immediately after they receive a new block. so a new transaction on min 10 would only have been picked if your miner started mining on min 10.

@_date: 2019-02-10 11:59:47
thanks god we have a wiki 
the difference between trusting a light wallet and a web wallet (like coinbase) is that for someone to defraud you with the light wallet they must spend energy (as the wiki says, to the point that it's profitable for them to defraud you) creating fake blocks and feed them to you, whereas the web wallet just needs to modify a database entry for free. If your full node disagrees on a block it rejects it with all the transactions in it, so you are not being fooled.
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:49:57

you are arguing [speciesism]( I think,
from that page,


This^ is nonsense because we aim to respect endangered species life as well because we value diversity and preserving equilibrium (if we are successful at it is another story..), even for species that have nothing to offer to us directly. 
And of course the cow and dog are given different treatment because both animals do not offer the same kind of resources, they were bred for different purposes. Why is it immoral for humans to depredate other species, but not for other predators like tigers, lions, etc? 
If you were to restrict our ability to feed us with meat you would actually be giving *less* rights to humans than to any other predator that can kill mercilessly. It is ridiculous to give the prey the right to life, that goes against nature.
And if you respected their life what would you eat? We humans [evolved to be omnivorous]( to profit opportunistically from available food sources. Variations in diet can have consequences. For example [vegans are at risk of anemia from B12 vitamin deficiency]( Vegans have to eat [fortified foods]( or B12 supplements (you can solve that by being vegetarian and eating eggs, but my point is if you are modifying your diet because some ideology then you gotta be careful, and there *is* a need for meat as a natural source of essential vitamins).

until the exchange releases the public keys I won't believe anything. let's follow the money. let's see, if it moves, if it follows same patterns like ransomware money. or if it just moves at all, which means they may be using the same exchange as laundering machine (like a corrupt bank), or if it moves to another exchange addresses.

so I made this tiny list
* Its code is at least open source with a free license. Better if it is an open source project.
* Check that it is possible for anyone to build the software.
* Check that you are able to verify signatures for releases.
* It has a checksum file. Usually the checksums are in the same file as the signature (the checksums are signed).
* Check that the code has been some time in the wild and that it has a community built around it.
* Check that the latest releases are accompanied by the corresponding updated code.
* Check if the app is well documented.
* It has real life people with real identities maintaining it. Usually the people authorized to update the code at the repository.
* Check if it has a working support team / forum.
* Ask in social media about other users' opinions.

But still Linux is more secure than Windows. Linux is not a replacement for good security practices but still get rid of Windows shit. you need to understand that if the users are gonna be careless ***as always they have been and always will be*** they will be better protected in a linux machine than in a windows one.

lol don't do that. the person that generates a wallet can do whatever they want with the coins, they can steal them from you. you have to generate the wallet yourself and backup the passphrase (write it down to a paper and don't lose it). it is very easy just download Electrum for android for example, it's an easy wallet:

I can give you 200 yrs
@_date: 2019-02-09 11:28:52
The blockchain is public but that doesn't mean your personal name is written on each transaction. Most wallets don't let you choose which UTXO to spent, and these wallets may use the dust coins along other coins to create a transaction. So they know that if the dust coin is used as input with other coins they can tie all those input coins as from the same wallet. Same wallet means same person, and tying coins to humans is the purpose of chain analysis.
The solution is to use privacy friendly wallets that support coin control features like Wasabi or Electrum, and never let the wallet choose the inputs for you. Never use dust to create transactions. Label them and eventually when the amount is high enough coinjoin them one by one.
@_date: 2019-02-20 08:55:38
it is true that etherum is shitcoin, it is not true that google said it.

@_date: 2019-02-10 19:12:05
I think thats not how it should work. if you buy X BTC you have to get X BTC. they should charge you from the fiat, not the amount you are buying.
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:22:54
This is related to general security. I was talking wallet specific. Of course if you use Windows youre gonna get ripped off. Also there's hardware wallets that are not open source, like Ledger.
Perfect security doesn't exist of course, but we need to aim to improve our security. And I hope my tiny list helps clarify things a bit.

if you use Tor your node will be more resistant to network partitioning. Also if laws change in your country and make bitcoin suddenly illegal you won't have an IP record at your ISP that you're running a bitcoin node. Also with a bitcoin tor node you wont need to open any ports in your router for inbound connections. you can follow this guide:
further improvement is to run Tor inside a VPN that you trust (not keeping logs). that way the ISP won't even know you are running tor.

I'm not qualified as in being a bitcoin expert buy Ive read some things, like I've been in btc since years. I don't know the hashrate distribution on the Russian side, but since they are isolating themselves from the rest of the world I think it's fair to assume the rest of the world has more hashrate than them.
so when they reconnect all the bitcoin economical activity on the Russian side that occurred during the disconnection most likely will be wiped out when the country reconnects and the Russian nodes see the chain that the rest of the world was building (which will have more difficulty) and will replace their current with this new one. that means that all transactions since the last block they saw before disconnection will unconfirm again. that means that for example if you sold a house for btc during the disconnection, your btc will be gone after reconnection. unless some nodes connect to the bitcoin network through other medium like satellite or ionosphere.
if youre a Russian node operator you'd need a way to sync the blocks plus a way to send transactions to the outside miners.

the problem is not with seeds/mnemonic. seeds is just a way to backup a wallet that must remain confidential. the problem is that the *wallet* uses that info in an insecure way. Coinomi is a closed source wallet so you shouldnt be using a closed source wallet if you care for your money. All wallets listed at  are open source.

@_date: 2019-02-02 22:53:24
many places where they don't have banking services or/and have oppressing governments. And upcoming bitcoin upgrades will make it that mixed transactions will become cheaper than normal transactions (Schnorr +  signature aggregation). So you will have the economic incentive, if not the privacy one, to do coinjoins.
@_date: 2019-02-18 00:07:11
windows is a closed source OS, so we don't know what it's really doing in the background with the data and logs you generate. for example following the guide above for linux, at some point your full node hidden server onion address is exposed in plaintext in the logs of the node. what if windows sends those logs back home? every configuration step that you type can be sent back. even if you unchecked all metric collection they can do whatever the fuck they want and bypass that because no one can review and verify their code. they are able to screenshot what you are doing on the screen.
all the network privacy software is useless if the computer is compromised. running windows means your privacy is compromised. using linux minimizes the risk of being hacked but you have to use common sense at all times. I recommend Fedora or Ubuntu.
I personally think that if Tor project offers a windows binary is just so more people generates data in transit to obfuscate that of those that really need privacy. you can't be private alone.

there's miners and there's full nodes. a miner needs a full node to know the rules of the network. a miner would need 51% of all the network mining computing power to attack the chain. it has nothing to do with full nodes. full nodes keep miners in check so they create blocks following the rules, but the full nodes follow hashrate to know which is the chain with most security hence the 51% attack risk. a proof of work algorithm change can 'fire' the misbehaving miners.

not only they are not open source but they are deceptive. they link to a public code repository in their site, but the code there has not been updated in months. the updates you see in the app stores contains unknown code. only when people noticed that they stopped calling themselves open source.
for all of that they were removed from bitcoin.org. here's the discussion

* How does the lightning network work? 
people create payment channels between themselves with bitcoin smart contracts and the aggregate of those channels creates a network in which you can send payments across many channels to anyone.
* Does it still use miners to verify the transactions? 
No. the transactions are always validated by full nodes even in the blockchain. you need to run a full node for yourself.
* If it does use miners then how could it be sustainable? 
It is sustainable without miners because Lightning does not need to maintain a global state like a blockchain. only those that are transacting need to be aware of the transaction, whereas on the blockchain everyone needs to agree. a blockchain like bitcoin has a consensus system based on proof of work and a p2p network.  but in lightning you just need two parties speaking the same protocol.
* Wouldn't the increase of transactions and the decrease of miners cause txs to be slower
afaik that would happen if mining hashrate dropped suddenly then we would need to wait for the difficulty to adjust.

it depends on your type of website. if you'll offer donation option you just paste an address. if you need invoice per product you need a software solution like btcpayserver. do not use webwallets like conbase or bitpay because they hold your coins and they can get hacked / regulated into a blackhole.
@_date: 2019-06-09 20:47:31
The wallet synced in like 5 min. Other wallets like eclair can take 15 min or more in my experience. And you can do backup, create wallet and add funds while the sync is being done in the background, like when you install ubuntu but you can keep configuring it meanwhile.

I think that the best user experience is leave the bitcoin logo as it is for any bitcoin payment type and serve a toggle switch web element to toggle legacy vs lightning, being lightning the default option and toggle action required to get legacy address.
i think we need a way to name blockchain vs lightning that reflects the security and cost, other than calling them on or offchain. for example 'direct payment' vs 'mine the payment' just a suggestion.
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:06:08
they do disappear from the blockchain and so does your money. zero conf also adds trusted middlemen that have to predict the risk factor of transactions. so more centralization. just use lightning for instant secure settlement.

you know it is about control because the bitcoin cash crowd claimed that their coin is the real bitcoin, they not only wanted to scale by forking the code, they wanted to inherit the bitcoin name and price ticker. they wanted to appropriate the narrative by saying they 'owned' the 'only true' Satoshi's 'vision' for bitcoin and played political games. There's a reason biggest exchanges colluded in the failed coup. bitcoin cash crowd also invented stupid conspiracy theories about developers being evil.

this is a nonsense statistic because miners can very well spam the blockspace and collect their own fees as reward.
moving precious metals across countries is also very costly. what big blockers proposed was in order to make moving gold cheaper let's corrupt its nature. and there you have it, a forked altcoin that was 1/10 iirc of the value of btc. and of course you have to pay less money for less security. and now lightning network will render useless many altcoins that sell low fees..

that's why I share it. I barely understand the science behind so it's good it gets exposed to criticism to see if it's valuable. maybe if you can encode a private key you can also encode anything, even an encrypted seed? would it be sec through obscurity if you encrypt the key beforehand?  at least it can be artistic.

@_date: 2019-04-26 16:33:08


IIRC that is different with blockchain.com wallets because just giving away the username and password you also give away the seed words. Bitcoin users are advised to keep the seed private, but some scams that target blockchain.com wallet ask just for your blockchain.com account username and password, even if your wallet is empty, and later the scammer asks you to change the password, like to disguise it in good faith, but the seed words do not change every time you change the account password. 
So the scammer once has your account info they login and go to Security settings and copy the seed words. Later when they finished the 'configuration' (maybe for a fake mining operation that will make you 'a lot' of 'profits') the scammer asks the victim to change the password so they victim feels safe, and asks the victim to deposit funds in his blockchain.com wallet. Once enough funds are in the address, the scammer generates the private keys from the seed he copied before and signs a transaction sending to his own controlled wallet.
This is a very common scam and blockchain.com should be aware of this. They should deny wallet creation until a backup is made and warnings are displayed. Another solution is to not save the seed in the users account after the initial forced backup. But AFAIK the did NOTHING.
This scam targets bitcoin noobs that think the only way to spend bitcoin is to punch a button in a website.

I've just tried again sending now from confirmed funds to a bc address and again same error notification:
but after some unreliable time the transaction appears. maybe some seconds, maybe enough for me to worry and try again just to get same error. but at the end it appears. all the btc wallets Ive tried before almost instantly give the transaction activity update but eclair seems a bit slow on that. I am using the def eclair node.

yes I still have one channel with enough funds to pay on its own, another with less than required for payment and one channel with exhausted capacity. also another channel that has been in closing state for a month and didn't update and I'm not sure if I really got the funds or not because the channel  current balance amount does not match with any of my incoming onchain transactions.

no because the merchant should not accept it as a payment with 0 conf. confirmations does not equal 'spent'. signing a transaction does not mean 'spending'. bitcoin has probabilistic security or something like that. 100% payent settlement occurs over a period of time the more pow accumulates on top.


this is interesting, lightning state transitions have to be signed by both parties in the channel so I think it would be doable to negotiate a opening a new channel.
@_date: 2019-04-29 09:57:33


wouldn't it also be very slow to coordinate everyone in the channel factory to reallocate funds for just one payment?

they can create their communist mining pool and seize asic factories, or command asic manufacturers to embed backdoors.
but bitcoin security doesnt depend on miners, but full nodes, so if a country starts censoring things miners would move to the cheapest place where they can mine free (as in liberty) bitcoins. full nodes would just kick off government miners with a code update.

Pretty good. here's my input.
* **Use KVM over Virtualbox**:
 &gt; **Why Use KVM Over VirtualBox?**
























* **Password Manager**: KeepassXC. Keepass for linux was discontinued iirc.
* **Encryption:** luks for partitions. encrypted containers with veracrypt.
* **Second factor:** buy and use security keys (yubikeys or similar). buy 2 (if you can from different brands) and keep one for backup (you gotta register both in same service) also do not forget to set up additional second factor in case you lose all keys (andOTP), and always download backup codes in case everything goes wrong.
* **Browser privacy addons (Use Firefox)**: Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin, HTTPS Everywhere, Privacy Possum, Decentraleyes (can break some sites but you can disable selectively), User Agent Switcher, Bloody Vikings, Cookie Autodelete, CSS Exfil Protection, Disable WebRTC, Link Cleaner, TrackMeNot. (firefox RAM consumption ~2GB, w/ all extensions and 10 tabs opened)
* **Bitcoin privacy**: Wasabi wallet.
* **Anonymous browsing**: I'm surprised Tor Browser not mentioned 
* **Encrypted mail**: use PGP. raw. do not trust addons like Enigmail because they can fuck up. use KGPG or command line.
* **Buy external disks for backup.** You can use Timeshift.
all of the above is intended for linux users. if you use windows there's no hope for your soul. with browser settings I get a very poor fingerprint check (my browser is unique &gt;:( ) I don't know what to do with fingerprinting.
@_date: 2019-04-28 06:54:05
out of the top of my head:
* hard to change consensus rules
* very conservative approach for changes
* bitcoin is where most of the crypto research and development is being made
not less important:
* cypherpunk culture and ethics (not a corporate soul less endeavour)
* sha256 mining hashrate monopoly (no shitcoin can dare to use same function for mining or else bitcoin miners can eat them)
all that makes bitcon the best store of value crypto coin.

this sounds a bit like propaganda or like they don't know what they are talking about imo. they used mining to get the bitcoins instead of buying from exchange?

non techie explanation: bitcoins are just like digital coins, some coins may be worth 20usd, some 1000usd, etc. When you make a transaction and want to spend 500 usd but your wallet doesn't have a coin worth 500 usd, it can take a bigger coin, say the 1K coin, and split it in the transaction, sending a 500 coin to the destination, and sending the rest as change back to a new address in your wallet. check again and you should see that your balance checks out.

no each miner is trying to find a rare number by brute force under a dynamic target updated every 2016 blocks using all the same hash function independently. when one finds a solution it broadcasts it to get the mining reward. the nodes add the block and build the chain and it starts accumulating difficulty. (difficulty because it was energy expensive to find the proofs of work).
it is secure because nodes will only accept the valid chain with most work. if you want to revert a confirmed transaction you have to redo a valid chain with a double spend from that point that outworks the current most cumulative work chain. anyone can check the total work of a chain. nodes assume that the *valid* chain with most work is the honest one. people can choose what amount of confirmations is enough security, for example 6 confirmations (that means the transaction is iincluded in a block and 5 blocks were built on top). if the tx doesn't get 6 confs then they can repeat the transaction. When the transaction is done an attacker would need to outwork 6 blocks to revert the transaction (and they can only revert their own transactions), and compete in real time against the rest of the mining network power. But it is more profitable to mine current block than revert past work so it is well incentivized towards security.

Restricted blocksize as bitcoin is a defense against DOS. Blockchains with restricted block size are meant to be expensive. you can remove the limits but you become vulnerable. Also without hard to change limits your full nodes ill blow up any day because they cannot keep up or got bloated. If you have low fees on restricted block size means that your code can change very easily or that no one is using your coin.


They mean fast in confirmation? I don't know. Peer to peer is the protocol, the transactions are broadcasted to all nodes for inclusion. If they mean per to peer payment, nor Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash can do them alone, you need Lightning.


means nothing, just marketing.


Why do you think confirmations exist? 0 conf transactions are dangerous because they don't have the same security as confirmed ones. You can get robbed on 0 conf. When accepting payments at least wait for a confirmation or more.


This is just marketing as well. Anyone can clone Bitcoin code and start their own team, and that's exactly what Bitcoin Cash team did.


Bitcoin is permissionless, you don't have to ask anyone to contribute or clone the code. What you can't do is force someone to run your code.

yes it is a free world, and if an exchange decides to delist a coin they are free to do so on whatever basis they like. people can move to another exchange if they want. I think exchanges are not 'free speech' platforms any more than any private social media site. If the 'speech' becomes fraudulent, hateful and harassing I would also delist. People are still free to transact in delisted coins.

it is important to now if someone is impersonating someone else to gain a relevant position, and knowing economics desn't absolve you from fraudulent activity. so it is very important.
besides, we don't need to know who Satoshi is or was. Bitcoin works without any paternal guidance from its creator(s). Don't fall for charlatans that want to gain influence. You run your full node for yourself and that's all that matters. If anything respect Satoshi's decision to step down as he did back in the day.
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:34:00

sending a transaction with higher fees before the actual one confirms is not called a double spend its called fee bumping. that's why merchants should not accept 0 confirmation transactions as actual payment.
double spend it is not possible if the money is buried deep enough in the blockchain. but what is deep enough? it's up to you to decide but experience tells that 6+ confirmations is enough. big reorgs are rare. lightning payments are not vulnerable to blockchain reorgs. although lightning is still beta.

he is saying that bitcoin is not efficient because it costs a lot to create bitcoin whereas central banks can print money costlessly. even a monkey understands that easy to make money is worthless money. if we use fiat it is because it is imposed on us by governments.
he also continues to say that because of that costly creation it would be very expensive to replace current money with bitcoin. here he demonstrates that he doesn't know that a bitcoin can worth more than 1 unit of fiat. 1BTC can be worth $20k as it happened before.
then he says that bitcoin right now is an asset not a currency. but he criticized bitcoin against fiat before. he then starts blabbering something about printing shekels. smh.

it depends. if you use biometrics as password then yes. better use it as username. use your brain memory for real passwords.


that's true but depends on the specs. some go from 10cm to 600m. you'd buy a passive low range as wikipidia says.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:49:04
yea that's the same your bank is required to do to ensure your money doesn't come from illicit sources. Most crypto services that interact with legacy finance have that requirement as well. Unless you buy directly from someone close to you but be careful of theft and scams. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:47:13
developers have their own motives, it's up to them to judge what they want to spend their time working on, or if they work for someone else. it is not like they pick what the users want, bitcoin is not a democracy. it's like a symbiosis of tech and humanity that happens spontaneously aligned with financial incentives. more like a meritocracy.

one thing that keeps me from using wasabi is that I don't understand if there's any protections against well funded sybil nodes. what stops someone from creating lots of nodes and filling rounds and rounds to pop out real people coinjoining? afaik one knows which outputs are theirs, so can a sybil entity start to gradually unmask real users by elimination?

to be fair this is the answer imo. I know other exchanges that filter by country on a per functionality basis, like inability to trade, etc. because for some reason you can't rely on kyc with documentation from those places (maybe official documentation is not reliable, weak governments). this is the same when freelancing you won't accept clients from some countries. one reason can be national sanctions as well.
note that all this has nothing to do with them being bad actors in this community (they are), this is just normal business. if you're gonna criticize these companies dont do it from their side.

Digital Currency Group in the early days funded Bitpay among others: 
Mastercard invested in DGC: 
DGC has as a board advisor Lawrence H. Summers whch was "served as the 71st Secretary of the Treasury for President Clinton and the Director of the National Economic Council for President Obama." nothing personal, but presumably you can draw a line btw DGC and govs.
DGC pushed for Segwit2X contentious hard fork without community consensus (they failed), which was seen as an attack on bitcoin principles. You can read Bitpay is among the signatories in their blog post
Bitpay was very reluctant to adopt scaling measures with wide user consensus, and I think they still don't use segwit addresses, they accept payments only.
Bitpay is censoring merchants: 
Bitpay goes against everything that bitcoin represents for freedom and they are here just to make money out of users and to put friction to bitcoin development.
if all this doesn't ring your bell then I'm sorry for you. use BTCPayServer alternative instead of Bitpay.

yea but privacy is useless if they ban your transactions because they identified a coinjoin. monero is way more private than bitcoin, but as you say cash is the most private of all because theres always a possibility of a bug in monero.

@_date: 2019-01-18 00:35:47
coinjoins are visible because the structure of the transaction, and many other things. there's efforts being put into making private txs look the same as normal ones. it's the first time I talk to a former criminal. theres a first time for everything! fungibility is not only for criminals, it's just a property of good money!
ok if you know better than me about cash then theres no point arguing :) . another thing for my argument, you need to take into account default privacy vs opt in privacy. 
monero altcoin for example is private by default, whereas bitcoin coinjoins are not. that makes a difference in the same way that, for example, Tor privacy is more robust the more diverse userbase it has, because you can't be anonymous alone. anonymity loves company. cash is private by default.

if the value increases it also increases the risk of hacking because lightning has hot wallets.
what would reinforce LN would be a price decrease, because some of the  current channels get devalued and would not afford payments and the users would need to open more channels that potentially become more payment routes, if I'm right.

hardware wallets have to be designed to be isolated from your computer and the internet which are filled with malware. adding bluetooth is an idiotic thing that only adds another attack vector to the wallet. they are starting to look like Bitmain adding tricks to the hardware. all of this on top of the fact that ledger is not open source.

Wasabi is not a mobile wallet, so not a good comparison ;)

I agree. see relevant discussion:
**edit**: I thought snappy packages were not official but it seems I was wrong.
**edit2**: also note that the malicious package in question is from the ubuntu snap store. in fedora for example, snap is not installed by default and from the fedoraproject.org I wasn't able to find a bitcoin package. so fedora looks like more secure and responsible to use imo.
**edit3**: ubuntu is not able to find a bitcoin package if installing from the terminal with `apt install bitcoin.` So maybe just advice to not use stores and just the terminal?

They wanted to increase their throughput (big blocks, private profit) and socialize the costs of validation to the users running full nodes. Big blocks mean you need bigger expensive machines to validate. 
Eventually only few nodes would be capable of validating, which will be their own running on AWS. Then they would get retro compatibility with wallets for receiving coins and control over development. That could end up with one fork per exchange, because that way they capture the users. All of that hand in hand with regulators prepared behind the curtain.
 All of that ^ FAILED. Even with 90% hashrate and most of economic activity they weren't capable of forcing users to accept the changes.

you are trusting ledger not to add a backdoor, without any sort of community audit of the firmware code. I'm not trying to convince you to not use ledger, it is just my money and I won't put it inside a device that I don't know what it's really doing. simple as that.
You can trust ledger, if you want, to not act maliciously and it's fine. It's your money and do what you want with it and I could not care less what you do. I don't expect perfect security, no one can offer that, but I have some minimal requirements for my purchases and one of them is the device has to be as open as it can be, and ledger doesn't meet those requirements.

I don't know legally, but technically you own private keys. A private key is just a number. Addresses are generated from private keys. You can  generate as many addresses as you want, and they may not have access to any bitcoins. Some private keys give you access to modify the bitcoin decentralized database (the blockchain).
If you don't validate all the blockchain for yourself (your node) then you are trusting somebody else to tell you that your private keys have access to the database.
You can't modify the database unless you are a miner or own private keys with access to unspent transaction outputs (UTXO).

this doesn't work on current block size limits because the number of transactions needed to match current network difficulty would have to be enormous and wouldn't fit in a bitcoin block. that's because current computers and smartphones don't have enough computer power to make too much work but the transactions are still all the same size pretty much.

yea, pretty easy. Hypothetically, I would dm to your reddit account a geolocation. I go to that place and hide the cash. Then you move to that place and recover it.
The more places to hide the cash there the more secure will it be until you find it. Bitcoin security works similarly, your private key is hidden in the sha256 bit space. It is so big that it's almost impossible for someone to find it.
relatively slower, but more private because there's no track of the transaction.

Bitcoin adjusts the mining difficulty to match hashrate changes. So, if today's big miners stopped mining you could set up you own miner and earn the bitcoins. the requirements are lower then more people can mine. It's the same argument than when people say what if bitcoin goes to 0 usd? There will always be someone that will buy them all even just as a collectible, and giving it value by buying it.


If bitcoin was dead you could not build lightning on top of it. Lightning requires miners confirming channel transactions.


Those of us that have been more time in this space know that Bitcoin Core is very slow on purpose on software updates because they refine the ideas a lot, bitcoin is experimental and often it's not clear how it would react. Also because a decentralized system is not as easier to patch as a single server. Bitcoin is the coin with the most money invested on it so it is understandable that a conservative approach is taken when dealing with upgrades.
But it's a positive thing imo that other altcoins test the new features, our money is secured in bitcoin, we can invest on alts, and when the bugs are resolved we port them to bitocoin ;))


Bitcoin is mostly used as speculative investment today, not store of value so the price in fiat will fluctuate a lot. Adoption will bring more stability.


Agree, gold has been here longer than Bitcoin, though.

Bitcoin broadcasts all data in a gossip way IIRC, and measured latency is very low as well, and devs work to keep it that way. So practically under normal network conditions the nodes know the last blockchain state as quick as possible. Natural chain forks have 10 minutes to solve, and that is plenty of time.
You don't have to be connected to each other node bro, that's how the primitve internet worked, and that's not how bitcoin protocol works.
I can tell you from experience as well because I run a full node and my blockchain always has the latest global state each 10 minutes on average.

1. No it doesn't. You can use blockstream satellite and a gotenna mesh to sync and broadcast transactions.
2. Lol everything today uses electricity. Credit cards also use electricity and internet and are widely used. If you lose electricity you probably have more important things to care about before money. You can also use generators.
3. You can use Lightning Network for instant payment confirmation and almost no fees. Cash is the best if you trust your gov to manage it right, but bitcoin is independent money.
4. If you use a service you must pay for it. Any other thing is not secure or sell your data.
5. You can combine bank security with bitcoin security. Like encrypting your seed and saving them into a bank safe, and use a hardware wallet to transact in bitcoin.
6. I've received a lot of helpful advice from people here and in other forums. There's also a huge amount of educational videos on youtube about Bitcoin. You can go to the pc store or ask a techie friends and family for help as well. There's plenty of information and help.

@_date: 2019-05-10 15:05:22
it's not sad dude. stop saying sad!!
fees are meant to be higher the more demand for confirmed transactions because the blocksize is restricted to avoid DOS of full nodes. if anyone can make free transactions on the blockchain full nodes would need 50GB of RAM (to say something huge). coins that have no blocksize restrictions are vulnerable.
lightning takes the burden of confirming transactions out of the blockchain so in lightning you can make free transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:49:51
yes you have because to know that you own it, you have to check your full node. from that point if you trust no reorgs will occur, you can shutdown your node until you use your coins again

@_date: 2019-05-01 19:17:08
some think bitcoin is not in need of more bandwidth, but the important part is to validate your own transactions. you don't need to store the bitcoin private keys in the same full node software, although sometimes wallets and full nodes come together in the same package but it doesn't have to be that way. you can connect remotely your wallet to a full node that doesn't hosts any private key.

if you want to use bitcoin you'll have to pay at least once the network fee. But the fee will be the same for an onchain payment transaction than for a lightning channel opening transaction. And once you are on lightning you can make as much transactions as you want for free, so in the long run you save money.
On lightning you can send as much money as your local channel balance.

you can't have a better tool for corruption and control than a bank, money wise. you don't have to use your ID to use bitcoin and no one can stop your transactions. as long as that remains that way bitcoin is the way to go for freedom.
I agree with you regarding not only techies, but other people that don't know what is the best mindset to create change. The people who invented bitcoin had an astounding understanding of human nature because they had to know what incentives would wire humans to the bitcoin protocol, but not every person here understands that, in the same way one person alone is not the spokesman for the whole community.

go to r /btc, over here we dont do personality cult..
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:41:10
so, when Electrum asks you a
* **Password**: it's to encrypt the wallet file. it's independent from address generation.
* **Custom words**: (optional). it changes generated addresses. When creating or restoring a wallet you have to select Options -&gt;  'Extend this seed with custom words'.
You need to use the **custom words** when restoring the wallet to get the same addresses. When restoring a wallet you don't have to remember the **password** you used previously, you can set a different one.
if you use different **custom words** or none at all when restoring, electrum won't give any error but the addresses will be different, with different balances.
if you forget the password you can restore with seed (+ optional custom words).
And the custom words make it more secure to store the seed because a thief would need the custom words as well to access the funds, even if they have access to the seed words.
now I get it.

I already knew all that. You seem to not understand my question: I asked for **proof** of **withholding** documents for **political** reasons. All your write up is about interpretations on timing and 'appears to be'. And to me is exploiting the fact that communications of WL with sources are not public as well as internal decisions to create a smear campaign and doubt.
One reason they might have released the files is to appear to be an important source of intelligence, not to decide who wins. But that aim was turned over by mass media into a negative thing. It is understandable in their situation to try make leaks more relevant, and to calculate timing for that.

What I commented is fundamentally different from coinbase or any other online wallet, because the bank is only storing a piece of paper, but because it is encrypted with BIP38, which some wallets do transparently to the user,  the bank can't steal the coins. You just literally need to write some words down and distribute it among friends, which will save the encrypted seeds in different banks. It is not much difficulty imo.
Online wallets like coinbase, xapo, exchange wallet, they can access the funds.
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:31:52
adding a password to the seed protects the funds in the case someone not authorized is able to read the words.

when you spend bitcoins from coinbase account to coinbase, or from xapo to xapo, or any other custodial wallet, you are not using the bitcoin network. What happens is these services swap coins btw local accounts on their servers, but the final owner of the funds is not recognized and not secured by the bitcoin network. 
When you redeem your coins from these custodial services then yes they would make a giga transaction, to cover many redeems, and that requires network confirmations and paying a fee.
If you use **non** custodial wallet then you have to pay fees sooner or later. Fees can be high, that's why we have lightning, to pay fees once and never again until your channels are exhausted.
Using custodial is not recommended because it is a mega honeypot for hackers, and you can lose all your money.

signing a message doesn't demonstrate identity unless people trust you. keys can be stolen. ownership and identity are two different things. the keys used to sign bitcoin transactions are used to transfer ownership, identities are not in play at all. bitcoin system lets you own bitcoins without depending on your social / real world identity, just by possessing a private key.

it depends because there's many types of mobile wallets. if the wallet interacts directly with the bitcoin network then you can send bitcoins to a new wallet to get rid of the unmaintained wallet. 
But, if the wallet uses a centralized service to send transactions, and that centralized service shuts down, then your wallet will stop working. here's a diagram:
* using a service:
(your wallet)--[order to send bitcoins]---&gt;(centralized service)---[send bitcoins]---&gt;(bitcoin network)
* sending directly:
(your wallet)--[send bitcoins]----&gt;(bitcoin network)
but there's also the risk that the direct wallet gets a bug that makes impossible to send coins after it becomes unmaintaned. but still that would be bad luck. so in that case you would need to restore the seed in a compatible wallet.

@_date: 2019-05-13 20:11:29
in joltfun you can buy a key with lightning and then redeem on steam.
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:45:22
great :)

I guess you coinjoined a far larger qtty. rounds take hours and servers need maintenance.
@_date: 2019-05-16 08:29:08
that is a very healthy decision. I'll do the same.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:36:06
I watched the video 2 times. best bitcoin ad ever :)

@_date: 2019-05-13 09:41:29


it should be made a noun just in your honour.
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:53:40
"integrated partnerships" always gets me.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:37:03
yes it [has](
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:19:25
once again Bcash demonstrates it's a shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-10 10:12:05
because bitcoin is getting its lightning wallets and alts cant compete, and people notice. the strongest crypto suddenly became the fastest.

anyone can run a LN node. LN payments can (soon) be split into smaller ones, so you won't need mega nodes to route 1K for example.

it can disempower if you ban US people from owning it. the rest of the world will use it and stop using dollar scam coin as reserve or that's what I wish for
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:24:20
I also check state on other nodes, like exchanges services etc. And it never fails. I trust my node. my peers are also connected to others as well. That's how the data gets to all nodes.
@_date: 2019-05-09 11:05:20
source? but still core dev means nothing, anyone can participate in bitcoin code. no one is a bitcoin representative.
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:13:53
im on expressvpn from US NY and video only plays pfizer ads. maybe I missed it :(((
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:15:06
take screenshots and contact their support. dont share screenshots here.

Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin in any way, so why call it that way? it is easier to give different names to different things.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:44:16
Ok :) besides bitcoin doesnt force anyone. You can run bitcoin any way you want.

all of them. I don't have time to explain everything to random internet strangers.
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:03:10
you forgot to put bitcoin logo on the sun
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:27:48
last paragraph is easy to quote and mislead fanatics that 'confirmation' means identity confirmation that csw is Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:29:29
here's an explorer link for the scammer address. no victims so far
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:10:02
I'm sorry, in 4 years it will be 500k easy . not financial advice DYOR.

I personally don't use closed source products for my crypto things. because closed source code bugs tend to be discovered later than if the code was open source and everyone is reviewing it, not just some restricted group of ledger engineers. so in my opinion ledger is more vulnerable than other hardware wallets.
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:29:00
shame on him for using microsoft services for crypto as well
