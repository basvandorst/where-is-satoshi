How does it work?
@_date: 2019-08-08 19:10:06
Bitcoin lightning network will never be simpler to use than crypto's like nano. Bitcoin will certainly replace gold but it will never replace fiat.
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:35:52
Bitcoin replaces gold. Nano replaces USD and other currencies.

10.6k now lol. Bitcoin is clearly not a good crypto currency compared to the rest. I could pick 20+ altcoins that would be better than bitcoin if they were as big as bitcoin. They deserve to be as they are better. Bitcoin's transaction fees were so high at the top of the last bull run imagine the fees when bitcoin hits 100k or 1 million. The only reason bitcoin price is going up is because of its popularity, if it was at the same level of popularity as some of the other altcoins then it would be considered a scam.

He is not willing to show me his real address. Can I later sue him if I had his ip address? And what if he was using a vpn
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:52:47
It's pretty easy
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:26:47

Why bitcoin. Lite coin, bitcoin cash, monero and dash are so much better
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:03:20
Bitcoin cash? A lot of other coins are more secure than bitcoin just admit it. Bitcoin cash price doubled when bitcoin only went up 50%
@_date: 2019-05-17 05:46:43
And that is why bitcoin cash is better.
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:33:34
Montero and zcash are are better coins to invest in, their more safe and secure than bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-05-12 14:54:15
U heard of bitcoin getting hacked
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:00:47
You guys heard of bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:31:34
For you's he definitely is
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:35:04
You guys say warren buffets wrong because he is ignorant and doesn't see the future. How hypocritical can you guys be. How are privacy coins like monero and high volatility coins like lite coin and bcash not better
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:57:25
Volatility=more profit
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:24:04
Higher volatility=more profits. The fees are lower, more secure. You're a blind follower
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:30:56


Look at warren buffets history do you trust him? I sure don't. Like I said higher volatility=higher prices.
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:01:06
I didn't say bcash was more secure I said there are so many other coins that are more secure than bitcoin and these coins have higher volatility so more profit
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:29:19
You do realise the transaction fees is too high for btc.

1. Edison didn't invent the lightbulb
2. If no one knew Elon musk and tesla got big and then he came back and said a rival electric car company is better then I would assume people would try to sell their tesla's
@_date: 2019-05-06 09:46:24
Buffet is one the richest people in the world and he got that money from trading stocks and buying and selling companies, why wouldn't you trust him?
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:44:06
7.5k now
