So if I have 1 BTC I will have 1 BCC as well? And the total value of my coins will be BTC price + BCC Price?

I am in Austin and I just had my mt.gox account verified today and do not plan on using it anytime soon. If you could think of a way to transfer 10k from my account to mt.gox that you feel comfortable with I would be willing to help.  I don't currently have 10k in my bank account so that would be a hurdle.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:41:45
Exactly, unfortunately its my only way in at the moment.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:12:31
