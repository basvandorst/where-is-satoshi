Dude, for some reason people ignore Steem. It already does everything Bitcoin is dreaming of doing. Zero transaction fees, 3-seconds-or-less transaction times and, even though it's currently only utilizing 1% block capacity, can already do 11.567 transactions per second. That's more than Bitcoin's current non-Lightning theoretical MAXIMUM of 7 transactions per second.
Did I mention absolute zero transaction fees? Because Steem does that.

I was about to ask that exact thing. Only one I know for sure does that is Blockchain and I don't think think anyone on Reddit is going to recommend it as the best.

I flipped all my BTC to Dash and ETH for now so that I can at least move it around freely -- at least until SegWit actually starts having some kind of visible effect.
Until then, fuck this shit.

Wow. Why the hell don't all the wallets have custom fee settings then? Blockchain does. You would think all the wallets we speak so highly of normally (the Myceliums and Electrums of the world) would at least offer the same or better. Weird.

I read this and checked one of my Mycelium wallets with $13.62 in it. Max amount I can send at the lowest fee? $7.54
If my math is right, that comes to $6.08 as my fee. At Mycelium's lowest setting.
So what the hell are you talking about?

Exactly! It sure seems like the people with enough bitcoin that these fees don't hurt are basically saying "fuck you, little guy" to the rest of us.

Obvious yet profound yet obvious insight is obvious.
