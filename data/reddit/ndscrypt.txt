I disagree, what's a 3% fee when BTC is rising by 10% per week. Anyone conplainning about a 3% fee is in the old mindset. I've recently seen people in the states saying they've been waiting over 2 weeks for MtGox accounts to be verified &amp; here you have access to a service where you can deposit money anonymously throught any major Canadian bank branch &amp; buy BTC without sending in copies of your ID &amp; without having your info recorded. Thank You CaVirtex ! LOL @ 3% fees.

He's giving a heads up to the BTC community. We need a base of people who *believe* in bitcoin who won't panic sell at the first sign of a down turn. Otherwise, like he says, a few big players could tarnish btc's public profile. I'm in this cause I believe in Bitcoin. I would *never* hold stock, hedge funds or bonds because in my opinion these are immoral ways of chasing money which, when traced back to their source, involve chinese child slaves, people losing their houses &amp; other garbage cannibalistic behaviours. This is why the current financial system keeps a certain percentage of humanity in poverty because due to interest fees there is never enough money in circulation for everyone to pay back their debts + interest. This has been built into the system. &amp; this is what we notice in our day to day lives. dog eat dog. Usury was once upon a time banned in Christianity too. It still is in many Muslim nations, that is what the "war on terror" has always been about, big money seeking world domination.
When you see how deep the scam runs, you'll shit bricks.

Bitcoin attracts conspiracy types due to it's nature. Satoshi may have been a bit of a conspiracy type, hence the genius decentralized protocol &amp; the dropping out of sight. I think it's good to scan the horizon for threats against btc while we work to build it up to a critical mass.

Our community should even be discussing contigency plans should the "authorities" try to escalate their shutting down of exchanges &amp; fear-mongering by FinCEN. &amp; if the center of society are eating shit &amp; calling it food, then what's so wrong with hanging around "the fringes"...

MtGox has done so much for bitcoin. They are a knowledgable bunch, have handled monster ddos's &amp; attempts at smashing the bitcoin market. They know their stuff &amp; believe in bitcoin.

I also feel that this needs to get resolved now. Bitcoin is being hurt, pretty badly - Once the public identifies btc as a Mickey Mouse circus where prices can drop 60% in a few hours &amp; most exchanges buckle &amp; go unresponsive for up to half a day, once that's bitcoins public persona it will be hard undo that damage. Can someone please chat with you-know-who &amp; ask them to at least put out a detailed release on what happened &amp; how they plan to deal with this in the future. Bitcoin is under attack. I suspect the usual suspects, but this time is really really important that btc *not* be killed..
@_date: 2013-03-31 20:18:04

if people are buying &amp; selling btc in Ecuador, which they are, then they are probably doing it in Ghana. Type Ghana's major city into localbitcoins.com, i'm sure there is some activity. It's probably easier than at MtGox... :)
edit- (ok, i just checked, there seems to be 1 guy selling BTC in Accra, it's a start...)

Contrary to what our sickened society has led us to believe, honesty is not a symptom of stupidity.
Be honest, be truthful. You'll be helping yourself out in the end. And everyone else too.

yes. $1000/BTC is possible. $500/BTC is probable. Distributed denial-of-service internet attacks by the ?US gov/3 letter agencies/big banks? or whoever... on MtGox occur every week now &amp; cause a mini crash. More sabotage is coming, if they can figure out a way. Full-on declaration that bitcoin is illegal seems unlikely for at least many many months...

I believe any technology can be used for good or evil. But I do believe Monsanto is evil. Along with all the aggro-chem corps, all the Haliburton type private soldier corporations, all the 3 letter alphabet soup agencies &amp; all the big banking sector... Other than that, It's all good stuff. :)

Please *do this*, Palestine adopting btc would change the world forever. :)

Excellent write up, great stuff !

LOL, I've noticed that what Canadians call "progressive" is often identical to what the US refers to as "conservative". Libertarian types. It's hardly up to me who comes anyways...

WOW, Pendulum/Knife Party never cease to amaze ! Saw these guys in 2003 in Toronto, still love them now.

Yay, brilliant !

Can you post it as a meme?
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:55:07
he who giveth, taketh away, Mt. Gox's servers are single handedly crushing the bitcoin momentum we had going....
@_date: 2013-03-30 09:52:19
Possible 3 letter US government agency attack on bitcoin? 
Who did it ? = who profits from destabilizing bitcoin ? (who fears bitcoin)
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:00:37
I think people would trade CanTire$ for btc. But what would you do with so much... oh, right.
Good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:48
MtGox, you had better explain &amp; give us your plan as to how this will not happen again. Take your damn servers offline if you have to. Implement a 1 hour delay between orders &amp; execution of orders... Do something. Grrrr....

previous ddos's in the last 2 weeks resulted in a return to pre-crash price with 24 hours. This a bigger / much bigger? ddos but bitcoin is *still* a revolutionary new currency &amp; fiat money is *still* tanking faster than a mtGox server. Id say were still in the 200$ range within a day or two. I just bought 2.4 BTC for $500. Good price, i think... Why is a multi billion dollar market collapsing every time a ddos hits mtGox. You'd think 3 weeks into this mess someone would buy a few computers &amp; cut these mini-crash attacks for the sake of bitcoin... please?

Unfounded speculation? You couldn't *prove* to me that the sun comes up each morning if I didn't want to believe it. Pardon me for insulting your intelligences but it's my impression that beliefs create realities, not the other way around.

I see now that I have failed you, bitcoin... But SpartaaaAAAA shall RISE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:11:22
Well said, I always laugh when people say "I should've bought when it was at $30"... LOL. I tell them I believe it can hit $1000, ...blank look...
Oh well. Im buying more. :) -I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you...
