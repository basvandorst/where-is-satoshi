I think the biggest challenge you will see is that bitcoin sales are fairly "rare". Think about BAC stock. There are thousands, maybe millions of dollars of shares being traded every minute. No wait if you want to buy or sell. Now bitcoin you might want to buy at the latest price of 800, so you put in an order to buy. BUT the next seller might want 859. So you wait. Then next seller wants 839. So you wait. Then the next seller wants 709... but that coin goes to someone luckier than you.
In short the "liquidity" of a thing is important to succesfully day trading. It is why no one day trades houses. It just takes way to long to connect buyer to sell considering how many are out there for trade.

I bought on coinbase today, so they at least have some up for sale.

Scale is everything.

I think that 1300 is just the most recent high plus a small increase. Look at any other wall street analysis of any stock. The target is always something like 1.05 x latest value.

That was me, my bad. Sorry folks.

There are no "instant trades". you put out a request to buy something. Then you wait for someone to sell to you. The thing that makes it seem instant on a large stock is that it only takes a millisecond because there are so many people just waiting to do something. In bit coin there just aren't that many people buying and selling at any given moment for a lot of reasons. One is that bit coins are much rarer than shares. Another is that all stock shares buy/sells are only on a few exchanges. But bitcoin trade locations are many and small.

What day do you think BC will break 100000$?

[Serious] Why did you say 10k? Why not 20k or 5k? Would love to know the reasoning you used not for the direction(up) the amount.

Well unfortunatly it seems to take coinbase about a week to deliver. So you might have to wait and see if you have 2x as you asked for.

The chinese government is against bitcoin. It is yet to be seen if the chinese people are for or against it.

I day trade stocks. Bitcoin is fun for me. Very different because of the low volumes, the high variablity, the long term uncertainty.

They let you buy as much as 10 BC or so per day. You put in your order, in theory you get the price at the time. BUT they don't deliver it to you for about a week.
