It's what is called a rhetorical question.  Here is the definition if you don't understand.  
A rhetorical question is a figure of speech in the form of a question that is asked in order to make a point.[1] The question, a rhetorical device, is posed not to elicit a specific answer, but rather to encourage the listener to consider a message or viewpoint. 
It's my opinion that your aren't making a valid point.  Saying Bitcoins don't deserve credibility because they can be stolen is crazy.  What can you posses that can't be stolen?  Hell your kidneys can be stolen.
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:36:05
That's the first troll tip I think I have witnessed.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:45:09
Does fiat currency deserve credibility?  Ever heard of a mugging?  It happens every day.  People steal things.  Its a fact of life.  
Also it is incredibly easy to make bitcoin transactions.  I buy and sell bitcoins on a fairly regular bases, and I can assure you that I am no super genius.
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:17:38
I didn't say it had the same or more credibility as PayPal or Visa.  Those are pretty credible institutions.  I am not arguing about that.  You just asked if Bitcoin deserved credibility because malware could steal it.  Then you named Paypal and Visa/MC as being more credible.  I would just like to point out that malware steals credit card numbers and Paypal info every day.

I am sure this will give Bitcoin more credibility when it officially accepted, but I use Bitcoin to purchase all kinds of stuff on Amazon.  I just use Gyft.  I bought most of my Christmas gifts this way.  I also just bought [this watch]( last week through Amazon.

Reputable companies don't make you buy products before they are ready.  When they are ready, they don't make you wait 6 - 8 weeks to ship it to you either.
I think maybe not ready is an understatement.  BFL doesn't even have a render of what they may look like on there website.  They also do not update the community with any kind of information on their progress.  This would be unacceptable in any other market.
BFL is the worst kind of company.  No one would be a fan of Apple if they did this type of thing.  Can you imagine, Apple announcing pre-orders for a device that may be released in four months.  When it is released, it will take at least a couple months, if not longer to get it to you if you are lucky.  So people pay now, and get a device 6 months+ from now.  People might flock to it at first because it was Apple, but it would not take long for people realize that this is not how a successful company is ran.

@_date: 2012-08-07 15:29:06
The fact that you have to buy something and then have to wait for it to be developed.  Then when it is developed, you will have to wait the typical 3 months for BFL to ship it to you.  If they wanted to do this, they should have started a Kickstarter page.

I have some 1 BTC coins and I think they look pretty nice.  The 5 BTC coins look pretty much the exact same, except they are silver colored.  The 25 BTC coin is huge though.  They are a little bit bigger than a one troy ounce American Silver Eagle.  I think they are not as nice looking as the ones and fives.  They are however more cost effective, so that is why I have a few.  I made my purchase over a year ago and I just checked the code on it.  There are still coins at the address.  Also, as far as the durability of the coins goes, they seem pretty solid.  I had one in my gym bag and it got pretty wet.  The bronze or whatever the coin is made of looks a little tarnished now, but the back stayed flawless.  I am sure I could get some metal cleaner and clean it up.  
As for as the silver 10BTC coins, they have a pretty hefty premium.  I prefer to just buy some ASEs if I want to invest in silver.  At current prices the 10 BTC coins have a $68.80 premium over the BTC face value for the one ounce of silver.  You can buy silver from goldmart.com for about $35 an ounce for an ASE.  That of course may be a non-point though as Casascius seems to be out of the 10BTC silver coins at the moment.  
Also Mike Caldwell is a pretty decent guy.  On my first order, I sent it from a Mt. Gox account and hit the send BTC button twice on accident.  I didn't even notice it and he sent me an email telling me I had sent too much.  He then sent the BTC back to me.  
Thats just my .02 BTC.

@_date: 2013-11-21 00:47:46
I didn't see in the document what happened if you mined them yourself.  I have quite a few that I mined on my graphics card several years ago.  I then converted them to Casascius coins.  I  did not buy hardware specific for mining bitcoins, I just had a couple 6950s I used also for playing video games.  I could not even come close to guessing how much I spent on power.  Would that mean that it was 100% capital gain?

I have about 100 bitcoins in Casascius coins. I told my wife about these when they hit around $250. I was worried if I died, they would sit in a box for all of eternity. I do have children. However I do also have a wallet that I keep some bitcoins in to buy stupid things like electronics.  This is how I can buy things without having a family meeting to discus if I really need to buy that iPad Air or not.

I can't get passed the login page.  Only BFL would require you to login to there site after you preorder something to say if you really want it.  Why did I preorder it if I didn't want it?

I just bought a Mid-2012 Intel i7 Apple MacBook Pro 15.4" with Retina | 2.3 GHz for 24 BTC on Bitmit.  I have also bought Silver at below spot prices there and countless Steam games.  You just have to watch for cheap auctions and you can get a good deal on there sometimes.  Also all the items are put on escrow so you don't release the coins until you get the item.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:13:57

They were the first pool I mined on back in 2011. I switched to Arsbitcoin and then to EMC. I have a miner that for some reason reverts to the the Bitclockers settings. It only does 300mh so I have never bothered to fix it. I usually cash out every other Monday, and on three different occasions, it would just stall out when I cashed out. On the upside though, about a 2 months ago I cashed out and they payed me double. It was only like .2 btc though.

It sat in there for about 6 months.  It looks terrible.  So I would recommend not putting it in your gym bag.  Also, if it is the 25 BTC coin, it is gold plated and as long as it doesn't get any physical damage to it, it will stay shiny forever.  As long as it is not dusty.

These were broke into several orders.  When I ordered the SSD, head phones and water cooler it took about a week to get.  The Motherboard was out of stock and they gave me the RAM in exchange for it because they were similarly priced.  I just sent them the difference.  FYI don't use Coinbase for this.  It took a day for them to send the BTC and the transaction at Bitpay had already timed out.
The GTX 680 was a different story.  About 3 weeks after I ordered it, they told me it was out of stock.  I did get different one shipped to me a week later though.
Overall I think they did pretty decent service and communication was also pretty good.  I will make future purchases with Bitcoinstore.com

Saying you want to mine at 50 mhash or 70 mhash is like driving a car that gets 2 feet to the gallon. Of course everyone is going to tell you to get a different car.

Or you could just put it in a box in your sock drawer.

I think I am used to small companies treating their customers with respect.  I emailed several months ago about my preorder not showing up on my account.  It took 7 weeks for them to reply.  Then the next day they send out an email saying that I have to confirm the order to get it.  How am I supposed to confirm?  I guess I will find out in another 7 weeks.
I can forgive the late shipments.  This is virgin territory, but there needs to be better lines of communication.

That's right, nobody uses the internet anymore. It has totally collapsed.

What deal do you get from Gyft?  Love those guys. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:21:38
Same here.

I am going to have to disagree with you.  My Lenovo X1 Carbon touch is majestic as fuck.  
@_date: 2013-05-20 22:25:03
This is the answer I clicked on this thread to see.
@_date: 2013-01-25 05:36:32
Thanks, I always wondered how to read that chart.
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:12:04
Oh shit.  I am surprised you got it back at all.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:24:20
So do you live an RV or something like that?  I am pretty sure that would qualify as a home though.  Do you just sleep in the streets then?

Well I guess I have never heard any of those stories. They said that I have the only set of keys that can open it. They even said that if I loose the keys I have to pay $250 to get it drilled. Of course this all assuming there not liars.

I sent some bitcoins to a bitpay address last week and it didn't seem to go through after about six hours. This has happened to me before with coinbase and the transaction just fails. So I sent it again. A few hours the new coins still haven't even started to send. I checked the next morning and the first transaction went through double and the second transaction also went through. If you know how bitpay works, they are timed transactions. SoI sent three times the amount of coins and have got 0 credit for sending them.  I sent Bitpay an email a week ago about it with no response. Coinbase's response was for me to ask for the coin back.

Well in about a month they might reply to that email.  I emailed them a couple of months ago about my order not showing up on my account.  They replied to it a couple days ago.
@_date: 2013-03-07 14:02:23
Better give it to him. I will send mine right away.

Now if we could just buy the Pebble with Bitcoins.

I declare ferroh the winner of this argument.
@_date: 2013-03-05 13:50:18
I'll hold you.

Hmm, that is weird.  Mine works fine and I have had 2 factor enabled since day one.  It worked on my iPhone 5 and when I got my iPhone 5s, it loaded flawlesly from iCloud.

I have mined about a thousand Bitcoins at this point.  It kind of makes me sad that I only have about 100 left.  I sold of several hundred when they were 3 a piece.  But I just have to remind my self that if the community was not active, it would not be were it is today.

Bitclockers has that problem all the time. They are poorly ran.  
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:19:56
In the news because they just shut down.  
@_date: 2013-06-11 18:16:10
Were does the number 57000 come from 
@_date: 2013-01-31 18:42:55
I just bought one.  I will update you guys when I get it.
@_date: 2013-03-07 14:01:26
Agreed.  Also I only clicked this link because I though it was Smallville related.  Spoiler: I was disappointed.  
@_date: 2013-07-27 14:02:32
I just bought a squat rack, 45 lb plates, adjustable dumbbells, and a bench using this same method. Gyft rocks!

Because BFL always ships at the exact time they say they will.  That was sarcasm.
