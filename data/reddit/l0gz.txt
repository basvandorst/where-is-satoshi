Gavin and Mike have been planning a fork together for at least a year based on evidence from the Satoshi email hack.

No doubt he will build some sort of "gitcoin" on top of this once he realizes not many people are going to mine his chain.

Gavin's salary seems to be $209K in 2013 for anyone wondering.

Can you publicly state everything that is managed or controlled by you? You seem to dominate literally every aspect of Bitcoin and it would be nice if we could decentralize your responsibilities and let other people have a role.

Isn't sirius the owner? Pretty sure it's his website and he can do whatever the hell he wants with it, and if he made you head administrator it's not like the community can do much to change that.

The whole thing is basically a scheme to try to prevent another altcoin out innovating and replacing Bitcoin. They want to make it so new coin developers are urged to use sidechains to make their coin, instead of altcoins. Then if the sidechain proves to be better, Bitcoin won't lose value. If they found a way to have the exchange rate change based on market forces, it would be ground breaking. Is this even possible? I guess you could try to build some sort of order book on top of the blockchain.

Did Satoshi Nakamoto leave you with any advice when he handed over the project to you and disappeared?

The only links Bitcoin.com has are from a few articles and blog posts covering the Blockchain.info deal, and lots of typos by people presumably attempting to link to the .org. The other sites have thousands more links built up over years from very high profile sites. Are you seriously going to argue that Bitcoin.com has higher quality links to it then those other sites? Google gives unfair privilege to keyword.com domains. This site wouldn't even make it to the third page if it was named Bitcoin123.com or something.

Seems to be, that was the account he used to introduce Bitcoin in 2009. Saved this  just in case he deletes it. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 09:25:02
Why is this site doing so well on Google search? I thought Google stopped giving keyword.com domains special treatment in rankings?

Someone messed with the sourceforge project  I can see the security mailing list.

You sound determined to take him to court no matter what he says. Do you expect him to pay millions of dollars for forum software?
@_date: 2015-05-18 18:17:36
I doubt he cared for ordering at all, otherwise he would have written his name as "Nakamoto Satoshi" in his formal writings.

It's ridiculous that a site with one page can outperform sites like the Bitcoin Wiki and WeUseCoins. This site is useless and just a giant ad for Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:50:28
According to the [backlink checker]( I used, Bitcoin.com has roughly 12,000 links to it, but Bitcoin.org, WeUseCoins.com, Bitcoin.it, all have at least 70,000. Those sites also have real content whereas Bitcoin.com has a handful of sentences.

No doubt Satoshi kept his identity hidden not for fear of law enforcement, but out of concern for his personal safety and protecting his fortune.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:05:00
Well think about it. If you were to announce yourself, you would just put a big target on your head. What's to stop someone from kidnapping your loved ones and demanding a payment in return for their safety? If you were to sell, you would crash the market and undermine people's confidence in your invention.

People are only buying in to get rich quick, rather than to use it as a legitimate currency. When you step outside and look at how many merchants actually accept BTC, it really doesn't justify the $2.9B market cap. Keep in mind that even those that accept BTC aren't exactly getting large volume of sales due to the price volatility. The current price is based on speculation on the future, and is not a real reflection of the existing bitcoin economy. You're going to see the price keep rising while the number of large merchants lags behind.

A good store of value? Seriously? One could invest $100K into Bitcoin right now and have no idea if they'll be a millionaire in 6 months or wipe out half of their investment. Gold and silver are commodities, Bitcoin is a currency. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:57:00
Sorry to break it to you, but they really don't care enough about their BTC holdings to actually attempt any sort of controversial market manipulation. A few billion dollars is chump change to the government. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:38:16
Is there a plan for what to do with the money in the long run? You're sitting on millions of dollars, and the forum already seems self-sustaining; it's just not going to be possible to consume all that wealth. In a few years time you're going to have $100M+ worth just sitting there. Why not just liquidate it amongst the staff and put this issue to an end before it becomes a serious problem? This "decentralized forum" farce has gone on long enough, it's painful to watch, someone needs to just become the owner or something.

Hashcash isn't a digital currency, it's a proof-of-work system. It's just a way to verify that someone has expended a satisfactory amount of processing power which is easy to verify.

But what if you doubt the compiler? At the end of the day, you have to trust someone eventually.

You should set up a web wallet on those domains. ;)

It was asking me to run Java on my computer. Seems down now though.

My suspicion is that a lot of people here don't actually contribute to the Bitcoin economy, nobody wants to spend their bitcoins for fear of losing out on future profits, which makes a lot of sense. People are buying in not because of Bitcoin's perceived utility, but in the hope of making more of dat fiat money. It's a bad time to be a Bitcoin merchant.

There's no such thing as the "official Bitcoin website".
