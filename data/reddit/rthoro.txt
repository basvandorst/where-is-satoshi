he just calculated wrong: 40 200 000 * 190 040 = 7 639 608 000 000

Nah, totally not, buy 5000 CNY pay 5000 CNY - card would be denominated in CNY and not btc

But you simply forget that they have to pay their employees, their goods and any other fees that are marked up onto the prices are usually paid in USD and therefore they need to calculate the prices dynamically
if they could pay for their goods, their employees and everything else with bitcoins there would be no point in dynamically adjusting the prices!
Therefore your definition of "not really believing and truly accepting bitcoins" is just wrong.

There is never a mining algo that can't be made with asics, you can just change it to a new one every 6 months to kill off any asic development, but if you repeat the hashing algos used, somebody could simply integrate every used algo and create an uber asic which can be configured for the currently active proof of work
Simply let it evolve, make asics available to everyone, make them affordable and see what happens

yeah would say the same .. there's that tiny - beforehand ... and with that he would probably owe a few million in interest

Interesting that both the 150k and the 250k was split up into smaller 5k to 10k  adresses and moved over the course of the 2/3 years
