It is trivial to dominate trading by volume: 
1. Set up an exchange 
2. Charge zero trading fees
3. Open a handful a shill accounts. Deposit 10 BTC.
4. Set up a trading bot that buys and sell the 10 BTC back and forth 10'000 times a day. 
5. Pronto. Now you can boast about being the largest exchange in the world (by volume).
Volume is irrelevant when trying to compare the size of the market. The measure you should be using is monthly revenues and profits collected by the exchanges. 
It's hard to tell what is going in in Asia because Asia is so damn opaque. I suspect that Asian market is relatively small and has relatively little effect on bitcoin price.

In theory, civil courts can run purely on the blockchain.
People who agree to fall under the jurisdiction of a "blockchain civil court" can post a bond which is then locked up in a smart contract. 
Judges and juries can be appointed using some kind of reputation and voting system.
Verdicts (penalties and compensations) can be executed by taking possession of the bonded funds (as far as allowed by the rules of the smart contract).
For criminal courts you still need some kind of government though, because physical force is required to execute verdicts.

She would most likely have lost them by accidentally deleting her wallet (or similar) before even getting a chance to sell them.

This has been going on for months. Every time there is market turbulence their site becomes overwhelmed. Why can't a company with as many employees as Kraken get their act together?

I find the way she sings mildly infuriating. She sounds like an upper class British person pretending to be lower class.

it's not overpriced, it's undervolumed

It's not either-blockchain-or-centralized.
Both can run in parallel to harness each other's strength.
The legal system is a good example. No, smart contracts will not *entirely* replace the legal system, but they could automate the more routine and "mechanical" parts of it.
PS. Oracles can be decentralized too.

Bitcoin is also a good hedge, since it's uncorrelated to other assets. Mixing a small percentage of Bitcoin into a portfolio can be a wise decision even for the most conservative saver. Or at the very least it's something worth discussing.  
personalfinance's zero-tolerance approach to Bitcoin is childish.

Where's the contradiction?
Anarchy doesn't mean "no rules", it just means "no top down rules".
Coin splits are textbook anarchy: Instead of a dominant group forcing everybody to adhere to its rules, groups who disagree are spitting off voluntarily to live under their own set of rules.
