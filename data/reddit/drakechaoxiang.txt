until they break into your house and steal your hard devices and cold storage, and use illegal surveillance to access your wallet.

I think I'm not paying someone shit who has stolen from me. If you mean the lawyer, In this particular case I don't even need one, though I have had more than one. It's "open and shut" as one might say, if they would actually hold a discussion on the matter. Which they refuse to do with me - they also refuse to take it to court knowing they will cause a precedent to be set that they don't want to be set. Legally they can't stall forever - yet, it has been a long time, many years, and this is still an issue I bring up with everyone on their end of things whenever I come into contact with them.

If the OP is fucked there is going to be violent revolution. (Unrelated to me and my situation, just as a cause and effect of this exact scenario as played out numerous times in history).

You think they won't do that if you have enough coins? I have news for you buddy.

They seized essentially everything I own (so the computers, phones, memory cards, a fireproof lockbox I had) and then when I went in and questioned them on it they played it essentially like they had no idea who I was or what I had lost, even though I've literally been in the same town doing the same shit for the majority of 20 years and I've been in there before to ask about it. I was not jailed or held on any charges, (for longer than the legal period without cause) they just confiscated my shit as far as I can tell, and since then when I've been picked up on minor offenses (because I fucking sleep outside now) they seem to just let me go and then I don't have further problems. I have been in their building to ask people about it and so on, but I get nothing but stoney-soberface headshakes, So I feel pretty fucked. None the less, I need/want my shit and I am unwilling to just let it go after all I've been through with them, I mean, this is not the first time the government has fucked me and I was always willing to walk away before no matter how bad because I prefer life, but I am really just running out of steam for the general purpose of survival lately, especially knowing that if i work and invest or save anything I earn will just be taken (read: stolen) without cause like I am a peasant needing to pay 100% taxes to the kingdom or some shit.

describing that on reddit wouldn't be helpful at all, actually, and also, that was down to the detail as far as things can be discussed.

This is not vague this is literally exactly what happened.

A friend who mined coins. I also tried to mine some, but gave up after a few blocks were completed - his computers were better than mine. He later got into full time mining. Many people locally had access to university computers who also mined, but in this particular case I can say they definitely came from him, and he definitely mined them himself and sold them to me, though I did have him hold them for me for some time. (Roughly until they hit 20-30$ per coin.) We worked together and saw each other almost every day, as well as were roomates during this time. I still didn't use them for anything.

It's not about beating some unnamed unknowable figure, it's about holding officials accountable for their illegal actions when there is record and in my case there is record unless they actively destroy it every single year (as I have the entire thing memorized and I restate/rewrite it etc, each year, to be sure they know exactly what is going on.)

they seized the devices, and a few days/weeks later they told me they had the bitcoin - probably a scare tactic like I had somehow used it for illegal purposes, so I don't know how they got it except they had physical possession of my stuff, as far as I understand they should not have been able to access it without breaking privacy laws - and as far as I understand I bought it in the first week through a friend, and it sat there until the day they took it. I certainly didn't use it for anything and I don't think my friend would have had the time or means to use it for anything in that time frame - I mean at the time you couldn't buy shit with it.

I was not given a reason, except that "we can take this" and them citing the property forfeiture laws as far as I remember (this was several years ago and I've been pursuing it since.)
