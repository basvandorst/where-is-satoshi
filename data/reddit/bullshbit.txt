With SHA-256, on average, for every bit you change, 50% of the output bits will flip.  In the case of a double SHA-256, on average, 50% of the output bits from the first SHA-256 will again flip;
Let's divide up the bits in an input hash into octiles:
I^1 I^2 I^3 I^4 I^5 I^6 I^7 I^8
On average, half the bits flip after one SHA-256, so ignoring the randomness, after SHA-256, I'll designate flipped bits with a '
I^1' I^2' I^3' I^4' I^5 I^6 I^7 I^8
Now we SHA-256 again: and again, 50% of the bits (on average will flip).  Again ignoring that the flipped bits from the input 
I^1' I^2' I^3 I^4 I^5' I^6' I^7 I^8
So, on average, half the bits will *still* be flipped from the input hash, but half of the flipped bits will be different.
Now, please elaborate on "tracing the bits in revese."   I already read the linked jheusser article.

Coins generated aren't considered confirmed by the Bitcoin protocol for 100 blocks;  And I agree, if you wait for even 6 confirmations (for your txn), you're very unlikely to run into an issue.
But there are merchants who currently trust broadcast (but unconfirmed) transactions.  (small transactions typically).  But the 51% (or hidden 51%) problem has many other ways to be exploited.  Create many trivial transactions/store blocks, etc.  
This is a good discussion, and I'd like to hear if you have any reasons to believe that in the short run, GHash.IO having 40% (or perhaps &gt;50%) of the network capacity is **not a significant issue**

Sure.  Every time someone gives bitcoin to someone else, there are two people involved.
So if all you want to know is how many times does each new bitcoin owner need to give bitcoin so that all 7B people on earth have bitcoin, the equation is:
2^n = 7,000,000,000
Just log both sides:
log (2^n) = log (7000000000)
n*log(2) = log(7000000000)
n = log(7000000000) / log(2)

So, there are initially going to be 400,000 bitcoins under control of the trust.  If the price goes up significantly faster than the actual btc spot price, those gains will be realized by traders buying/selling shares of COIN.
I suppose if the price of the ETF does begin to exceed the market rate, this is incentive for the trust to purchase more bitcoin and sell them in order to arbitrage the difference in price between the 1 ETF share an 0.2 btc.
If the ETF is approved, I expect additional shares to be created very quickly (and bitcoin purchased) due to the expanded reach of ETFs compared to bitcoin exchanges.
Get your sell orders ready, there's going to be huge financial incentive to provide exchange liquidity in the near future.

I agree - I don't like using the u/μ due to the confusion/ambiguity this creates.  I remember when MicroTorrent  (μTorrent) spelled their Windows client app with a u.  It was easy to find - just press the Windows key, type uT, and bam, uTorrent is highlighted.
Later they officially switched to μ.  Who remembers the unicode digits for μ?  I certainly don't.  Now it's more difficult to find because u is not a match for μ when searching.  If you're looking through a folder structure, μ is also not alphabetized the same as u.  With a term like **bits**, there's no need to hunt for μ or use a u in place of μ because you don't have a μ readily available.
If standard keyboards had an easily accessible μ character, I could support a term like μbit, but as the world stands, it's just not feasible.

Couldn't the same person just write daily news stories and PR related to Bitcoin and post it here at reddit?  
Reddit is currently one of the primary sources of information/links/data/analysis regarding Bitcoin, so even more "co-branding...as an authority figure in the field" could be done here.
Why should anyone share the "intangible" benefit of their hard work with you, both diluting their own benefit and enriching your business (whether tangibly or intangibly) for free.
You don't even have a website yet, Mr. Lyford *(Apache/2.2.26 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.26 OpenSSL/1.0.1e-fips mod_bwlimited/1.4 Server at banxgroup.com Port 80),* so is your business plan to take the hard work of other people, post it on your site, and make some money?

Ah, the old **[make your own luck]( trick

There will only be 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis ever created  **(think of them like "cents" if you're used to the US dollar).**  That's 2.1 quadrillion, plenty for everyone on earth to have some!   (there are currently only 1.3ish quadrillion satoshis in existence)
Another useful bitcoin unit is a "microbitcoin," sometimes abbreviated as uBTC (with the u representing a greek mu, the SI representation for micro).  Other people will call a microbitcoin simply a "bit."   Coinbase calls this unit a BIT (all caps) and you can make this your default unit for this site.  **Think of this unit like "dollars" if you're famliar with the US dollar.** 
So, to recap, there will only ever be:
**2.1 quadrillion satoshis** "cents" or "pennies" and **21 trillion bits/uBTC** "dollars" ever created.
With a world population of ~7 billion, there will be enough bitcoins for every person to own 298,000 satoshis or ~3,000 bits.
Now, the even better answer is that bitcoins can become even more divisible at any time.  This would be a like a "stock split" if you're familiar with these markets.  It would be a value-neutral change, and it's unlikely any miners/mining pools would resist upgrading to new software that supports additional divisibility.
 Farther down, pokertravis finally fixes the phrasing of his question:  If every person that has bitcoin gives some to someone that does not yet have bitcoin, how many iterations would it take?  (this is a naive question since it ignores the difficulty finding new people that do not yet have bitcoin after a few iterations, but the math is easy)
 Every time someone gives bitcoin to someone else, there are two people involved.
 So if all you want to know is how many times does each new bitcoin owner need to give bitcoin so that all 7B people on earth have bitcoin, the equation is:
 2^n = 7,000,000,000
 Just log both sides:
 log (2n) = log (7000000000)
 restated:
 n*log(2) = log(7000000000)
 n = log(7000000000) / log(2)

No, device verification exacerbates the problem!  Look, you're trusting an individual's developer account.   **All** people are fallible.  Companies have deployment procedures that are enforced with technical controls.  When an individual is controlling an application, any deployment controls would be irrelevant.
Again, device verification makes the problem much worse because it gives Coinbase customers a false sense of security.  Re-read the attack vectors I have presented - they are not by any means protected with device verification.
This is definitely **not** fear mongering.


Re-read my proposed attack vectors.  Coinbase does not have anywhere near sufficient capital to make victims whole.  Their profits are a fraction of a percent of certain transactions.  The company has significant overhead since they are very new, and nearly all their working assets are owned by other people.  How could they be held accountable in case of a loss?  Spread the loss among all customers?

Orphan rate is actually central to this post.
1. GHash.IO actors spend some btc
2. GHash.IO actors specifically omit a txn for members of their pool
3. After 1 confirmation, GHash.IO actors secretly funnel all their solved blocks from miners **in other pools** back to their own pool, giving them a 51%+ stake in their network until they orphan the second spend
Regarding your other point, that mining pools aren't all sharing their hashrate **cough GHash.IO cough**, you're spot-on.  But you're further supporting my hypothesis...

A risk of blockchain proof-of-vote is vote selling.  Sure, tihis problem could occur with the use of traditional ballets or absentee ballots, but with a blockchain, there is much higher confidence between vote-buyer, and voter.
In fact, if the payment for votes was made via multisig transactions, risk for both parties is significantly reduced.
There might be a clever way to limit vote inspection to the holder of a voter's private key (and the vote authority), but nothing immediately comes to mind.
Blockchain voting with a private blockchain (perhaps auditable by a few trusted groups) could be a solution, but this significantly limits one of the largest benefits of blockchain voting (anyone can inspect the blockchain).

+1 for good discussion, but you're incorrect here;  Inflation (real) in Venezuela spikes as high as 400% annually (perhaps even higher for some short time spans), but the *rate of change* of inflation in this country does not change rapidly, and you can go convert it for USD or bitcoins within a few days and only ("only") lose a 1% or so of your value.
Contrast with btc where you might have a 20% or larger swing in a day.
If you look at my other posts, I'm very bullish on both the utility and long-term value of bitcoins compared to fiat currency, but in this case, paying someone directly (not going through a payment gateway such as Coinbase where your btc are immediately converted to fiat) is riskier than cash.
Also, the OP did not mention the contractor was not local, so the cost of transmitting funds via Paypal or Western Union does (partially) offset the large risk of holding bitcoins for a day.

Tl;DR:  We are already at our maximum position.  We need individual investors (**that's you!**) to buy and hold.  We will unload a portion of our position on the way up (price-interval selling), and re-purchase during the next correction.
Hey, not everyone can buy low/sell high!

Cool, kinda like when you hire people to do some work, and you pay them with cash.  (except lower fees (none), and less volatile currency when you use cash)

The real money is from their rogue employee retaining a copy of your private key.  If they're smart, they won't sweep the address at the first sign of funds -they'll wait for a few juicy targets with 10+ BTC.
Hopefully it's a BIP38 private key, protected by a strong passphrase.  (perhaps you could also preserve a copy of the passphrase on a fire-proof piece of aircraft grade aluminum?  Perhaps cryobit could give you a 2fer discount if you have them create both?  er, wait...)

I took Calc I/II from him at UW &gt;20 years ago.  He wrote the textbook we used.  "Koblitz Notes."  It was a great class - he figured we could spend our time reading the textbook to learn the basics, so he dedicated portions of the lecture to useful applications (of the current topic), as well as his current research.

Hah, like Newsweek would ever produce an article their readers are actually interested in.

Perhaps I've spent too much time lurking here, and I'm getting cynical...
Every time I read a bearish post warning me about an impending drop back to $10 or $0.10USD/btc exchange rate, I can't help but think it's actually a (bullish) whale behind the keyboard (especially when the OP never returns to the thread to continue the "discussion").
And every time I read a bullish post admonishing everyone not to miss their chance to buy in at a bargain, I envision a scared sheetless (neophyte) investor who is so bearish they already sold 95% of their hodlings.
So here's my question: will the USD/BTC exchange rate reach $10,000/bitcoin by June 2014 or will I need to hold until Dec 2014?

Thanks for the tip!  I'll tip it forward!

Thanks, good explanation for being allowed to skip transactions if desired.  There could be reasons to not give so much power to the mining pool operator, or they could force members to process 0 fee transactions among other things.
However, this behavior (flexibility to append/omit coinbase txns independent of pool coordinator) is exactly what is needed for a potential exploit, per the OP.  (e.g., if the GHash.IO pool owner(s) also have significant power in other pools)

Maximum throughput.  (you can use their service as a SOCKS5 proxy, or a full PPTP/L2TP VPN tunnel).
I've also used VyprVPN in the past &amp; had very good experience with them (sustained 10+ Mbps for days on occasion).  PIA is significantly less expensive, and they accept bitcoin, so I decided to give them a try.

As long as you call it Bitcoin, and not "Edison Money," I'm all for it!

That's correct, I'm still HODLing*
