I agree 100%.  That is the kind of content that deserves a real tip.  
When you use someone's DIY tutorial that saves you hundreds of dollars the least you could do is tip then tens of dollars.  If you're broke then buy them a coffee.

You would turn down 50,000 5 cent tips? 
The alternative is no tip because you think people who tip 5 cents are insulting spammers.

Thank you!

I didn't see a requirement for QR.  It looks like you can program your wallet on a NFC tag you can carry on your key ring.

Feature Request - Can it please charge people money every time I see their stupid duck face selfie?

Tips under 1 cent are spamtastic.  1 cent or greater tips are perfectly acceptable.

I didn't want to buy them when they were 10 dollars.  Now I feel like an idiot.

I probably sound like a broken record - BUT - if this does catch on it could transform the intertubes.  Content creators may no longer have to rely on advertisements to make creating useful content worth their while.
have a wonderful day @_date: 2014-11-04 11:17:10
Thank you for being so generous!

Like tipping your waitress for great service you can tip someone for valuable ideas or commentary (posts, pages, comments).
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:25:39
I'm not at a mass convention of people who are interested in the same thing as I am everyday IRL.  To attend a convention like thiat there is usually a registration fee, not to mention travel and incidental expenses. 
You are comparing apples to oranges.

Go hit up every niche you can think of on you tube.  Indie singers, Minecraft moguls all the you tube sensations.  TIP them if you like them!  
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:15:48
I feel bad that you feel bad about people sending tips.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

Any money given for a post or comment that is submitted for no pay is a bonus.  I wouldn't complain about a 5 cent tip.
If tipping for comments, posts or opinions catches on then a 5 cent tip from each person who reads it could turn into a large sum of money.
@_date: 2014-11-04 04:37:58
Looks like it is.

Part 4 revenge of the tips!  All your base are belong to us!

Please don't spam me with your anti spam. Why do you consider my post spam.

I like this concept tipping tuesday,  let's remember this day on throwback thursday by throwing around some more tips!
In all seriousness, the theory behind small micro tips for valuable content (comments, posts, pages) is great.  If it catches on the concept could totally replace the AD infested interwebs of today.  I would definitely tip web pages that host ad free content more generously than those that have ads plastered everywhere.  Just a thought.

There is a 2 block chain confirmation update wait before crediting deposits to your wallet, so make sure you have money ready for tipping!
It looks like it should only take  around 20 minutes from the linked chart below.  Not bad at  all.

And I was talking about your suggestion not to spread tips on you tube.  Instead of trolling please provide alternative ways to tip you tubers?  Is there a better way to show monetary love to people who make content you enjoy and follow on tube?
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:02:10
Totally agree with sub 1 cent tips.  That is indeed spam. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:43:26
Thank you sir.  1 cent is fine with me. It's the sub 1 cent that I find off putting. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:30:59
You tube is paying you because you draw people to click and view their ads.  People tip because they find the content valuable in one way or another.  Showing appreciation.  Would you toss 1/4 of a penny into musicians hat for playing a beautiful song?  Or tip your waitress .003 cents?
If you can't afford 1 cent should you really be giving money away in the first place?
