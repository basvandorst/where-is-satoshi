its actually a thing. The scratch off keys are the seeds/private keys;
The main problem with buying a wallet from someone is : how are you sure no one knows the key ?

You have to read about how home PC came out. Microsoft wasnt even a thing back then. Apple did dominate a sector it created : PC at home.

You never know you have a virus. You'd be surprised at how many viruses are not detected by all antivirus softwares. You cannot claim you never had a virus on all your years of PCing, in fact I'm pretty sure you must have had a few dozens of trojans and viruses without even knowing it. I myself think i'm clean and a good session of scanning reveals i picked a couple ones here and there. That's where unix systems are better because they intrinsically are harder to infect. It's usually by misdirecting the user while pure virus spreading on windows machine is a lot easier.

Hello bitchick
Sorry for your loss. Could you in the interest of everyone share with us what phone, os, or computer app and computer os you used ?
I am getting interested in a trezor and use exclusively iOS and Mac OS and chose iOS as my first hot wallet, confirmed by antonopoulos mentionning phones especially iOS to be the safest. But I’d like to hear the specific of your case to confirm/inform which systems are subject to hacking. Again sorry for that :/ hope you didn’t loose it all

Macafee literally said yesterday evening he needs a few thousand dollars” to make a bitcoin. And the day it’s too expensive to mine a currency, he switches to another.

I’m super happy with “Coin Stats” on iOs. UI is gorgeous supportes manual and automated updates through the API keys from exchanges.

Hi5 my friend. That’s precisely my plan.
If it takes too long I will start by selling a bit of my btc but other than that detail, that’s my plain. Exponential and logarithmic plan.

they do that everyday by buying shares.
My own company got bought 4.6% of its total worth out of the blue by a competitor.
Price has gone up by 60%, after news settled went back down 10%.
Companies are worth more in assets or liquidity than in cash. The "currency" part of their operations can sometimes only be a relative small percentage. I don't think volatility is the concern of all companies at all.

Ask this to people from venezuela/zimbabwe how their bank account is doing at the moment.
The credit card is a thing, the currency is another !

I have done 6h maths / physics tests every week for 2 years
The most difficult purely scientific school concourse in france (the ENS) has only one sheet of paper with a couple questions like these only, except they are far, far deeper, and they tell you you have 5h or so to answer and you might end up producing 20/30 pages of fundamental maths/physics to get a good grade. Basically they wanted you to produce content like a physicist in front of a problem. I recall an instance that was basically "Your goal is simply to intent to create a model of the flight of the colibri" and you had full freedom of what you want to create to approach the problem.
I never applied to that school because I was unable to get to that depth level in the fields but I know some who did and they really really were good at maths. And when I mean good, I mean proper good.
Other concourses usually propose more exercises with straight questions (like this one), and some others propose a shitload of questions and you basically try to answer as many as possible and it's impossible to finish it all and it doesn't matter because it's a concourse so only the ranking counts.
Open questions are the norm in french schools, so important tests are usually long. For the big big schools the concourses were 1 full week per school, 1 or 2 subjects a day. I did 3 concourses but I know people who did up to 5 or 6. It's insane but doable.

i waas not clear, in fact they were 4h but some classes no some subjects had 5 in my school and in some cases exceptionally 6h, but most of the important ones were from 8 to 13

the video also mentions he entered at 1000 with buys up to 9000. His firt answer was not he lost money from the ATH, because he is holding. The interviewer insister on a clickbait value to put on top of his article, so he did some quick math and said he lost 500K from the ATH (that means he has 50 to 100 btc btw) but that it doesn't matter to him because he is very long on this.

I think it’s not orbiting it’s going to Mars actually ! I mean, if the 4th engine works. If it doesn’t maybe it will orbit forever ?

For now it's not happening. The dow jones dipped precisely like the BTC dip, proving that at least for now BTC is not acting like a hedge for traditional markets
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:55:42
You might wanna find a comparison of the dow jone dip, and the btc one. They are precisely correlated, proving people who wanted to cash out did on both ends.
