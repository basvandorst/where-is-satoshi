TCP/IP is nowhere near a single monolithic layer.  It is built on top of hardware driver layers, operating system layers, and then many, many, many other layers are built on top of it by the time someone sees a webpage or runs some JAVA script.
* Device: NIC
* Driver
* Ehthernet
* IP
* TCP
* Sockets
* File
* Application

That's what I meant, I should have been clearer.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:23:33
For systems which use a single encryption key this is generally true.  I'm talking about computer chips which literally execute encrypted code; known as a crypto-processor.
For these systems, each person who gets a copy of software receives a version which can only execute on their physical device and no one elses.

The effective blocksize with SegWit is not 4mb, except in some hypothetical abstract theoretical way.
The actual effective blocksize, with SegWit, and only if 100% of all transactions were SegWit transactions, based on the current actual transactions on network today, is **1.86mb**.
I'm strongly in favor of Segwit but I do not think it helps if you quote exaggerated numbers in your argument.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:10:52
I should add, the prevailing theory is this guy will just 'give' the money to himself and say it was someone from this thread. But if a known person gets it, that's different. If I got it, I would just turn it over to the rightful owners if they are, in fact, stolen funds.
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:48:45
The moral argument is pretty clear.
If I create content for people to consume, and I wish to charge money for that, then people who consume it without paying for it are stealing my work.
Why is it that paying people to do work in any other context other than creating content makes moral sense to you?
If I cut hair, give a massage, trim weeds, or perform any other kind of service it is reasonable and expected that I be compensated for my time and effort.  To perform a service and not pay for it would clearly be considered immoral in pretty much every context.  But if the service I provide is content, somehow I deserve to not be compensated?
It seems the logic around here is that if something can be 'copied' then it cannot be theft.  So, the natural response is to create content which cannot be copied.  Software distribution is moving in that direction; by giving each user a custom build of the software which can only run on their hardware, and no one elses.  
If I give you a custom copy of software; which can only run on your device and no one elses, then in that case you agree that I deserve to be compensated; but, if I don't include DRM, then all bets are off.  Since it can be copied, it is not theft?
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:24:52


I am not yet convinced we do.  If two-way pegged sidechains can be secured and easily spun-up to accommodate additional demand, I'm not sure the blocksize needs to ever be any bigger than it is today.

Just curious, how do you trade bitcoin on an exchange without it being on exchange?  I understand the logic of removing it when you have no buy or sell orders pending; but doesn't it have to sit on an exchange if you have active buy/sell orders?

If you don't believe encryption works, why are you using bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:17:04
If someone wants to distribute their own content, for a fee, that's awesome.  I'm talking about companies which spent a lot of money producing either a video game or a movie and people who steal copies of that content without paying for it.  You can conjure up all of the tortured semantic arguments you want, but the plain and simple fact is that people are getting something without paying for it.  
@_date: 2016-08-30 03:05:52
The point is that a working TCP-IP implementation is composed of many layers in a network stack. Likewise, we shouldn't keep trying to cram every single feature into the core bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:20:47
A fork is an attack on the network.  Why not just create an alt-coin on it's own network?

Of course we have to complete with free.  Good luck watching your kickstarter 'XMen' or 'Star Wars' or playing your freely made with zero budget 'Call of Duty'
I have no clue what is wrong with people like you.  You do realize that movies are not made by soulless corporations, but by thousands and thousands of creative artists who put their heart and soul into the work so others can enjoy?  They deserve to be compensated for their work, no less than anyone else who provides a service to others.

Roger posted this on Facebook where we had the following exchange.
My initial response to Roger: "Bitcoin's best use case is as a global store of value, a Gold 2.0 if you will, with payment transactions happening on other layers which derive their value from the main blockchain. 
A combination of networked payment channels and two-way pegged sidechains can solve all of the needs of the global community, including massive growth and trillions of microtransactions. 
Why this impatience?  It's like we were all given a goose that lays golden eggs and people want to butcher it now because they want a drumstick."
To which he flippantly replied: "And flying cars would cure all the traffic jams today too. Too bad none of the things you mentioned exist yet either."
My follow-up: "Well, first of all, sidechains and networked bidirectional payment channels do exist, just not yet fully deployed into the ecosystem. 
Software engineering takes time, especially software which handles value transfer in an adversarial environment. We cannot scale the bitcoin blocksize to any major degree without introducing massive risk. 
The bitcoin network should be extremely robust and risk averse. It is not the platform to do risky experiments on. That is what alt-coins and sidechains are for. 
Bitcoin's most important property is not as a payment network but as a way to store and transfer wealth without risk of confiscation by the state. The current core plan is the safest approach. Anyone can spin up an alt-coin with higher transaction capacity, and many already exist. None scale to global transaction levels though. I just think we should be much more conservative. It is more important to me that bitcoin can safely protect and store value than being able to perform low cost  microtransactions."
Another Facebook user said: "If that really is bitcoin's best use case, then Satoshi, and Bitcoin, have failed in their purpose.
And both those things you mentioned still require bigger blocks."
And my final reply:  "I disagree. Being able to hold and transfer value unmolested by the state is definitely the single most important property of bitcoin. 
No one is intentionally trying to "cripple" bitcoin, they are trying to protect it. It's a shame how few people understand how robust networks are built.  You don't keep piling more and more complexity into a single layer. 
Robust networks are built in layers with each layer being well defined and simple as possible. Each layer targeting a specific problem set. Bitcoin will never scale on-chain to global transaction capacity and it will never handle the true microtransaction use case which implies trillions of transactions of miniscule amounts of value. 
All of these things should happen in additional network layers. 
As a software engineer who has written network stacks, this just seems completely obvious to me. I get that non-technical people, maybe they don't understand this, but it is true. A one size fits all monolithic network protocol is destined for failure."

What is so difficult to understand?
Movies and video games are made by people.
Those people have jobs.
The content they create is made for sale to the public to either consume or not.
If they consume it, and pay for it, then the people who created the content are able to have a job and can participate in a our capitalistic society.
If you consume it, but don't pay for it, then you are stealing the creative work of others.
Do you seriously think that in a capitalistic society people have a right to create and sell 'things' but not a right to create and sell 'content'?
Your position in indefensible and just a rationalization so you don't feel bad about stealing from content creators.
@_date: 2016-08-30 05:17:17
I think that is a great idea
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:28:01
This is an absurd question.  The **OPTION** to purchase subscriptions to 10 different online streaming services didn't even exist a few years ago.  It was a response to market demands.  Prior to that, the only way to get content was via a bundled cable/satellite service.
The consumers wanted *choices* and the ability to purchase content on an ala-carte basis.  Want HBO but not a $150 a month cable bill? Well, now you can.  And that's a very recent development.
The market responds with more options to meet the needs of consumers, and you think the system isn't working?
Go back to your $150 a month cable bill then.

Well, I have good news for you then.  You know how it is that you can't just 'make a copy of my bitcoin'?  Well, the same kind of technology is coming soon to a media device near you!  
You claim it's not stealing if you can 'make a copy'.  Well, what if, through the power of encryption, I make it **IMPOSSIBLE** for you to create a copy of my content?  Because that is the only option left.  Nobody likes DRM, but that's where this thing is heading.  We will make content which cannot be copied; just like bitcoins cannot be copied and reused either.
Here is what the industry has been driven to.  We are creating encrypted computer chips.  Each time you get a piece of digital content, that content is signed so it can **ONLY RUN ON YOUR DEVICE** and no other.  If you try to make a copy, it won't run.  You can't hack or reverse engineer it, because the encrypted chip makes it nearly impossible to do so; with anything less than an electron scanning microscope.
So, you claim it's not stealing if you are 'only making a copy'?  Simple, we will make it impossible to copy!
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:18:28
I see.  So you do not consume either video games or movies?  Or, you steal them and feel good about yourself while you do so?  You don't give a shit about the artists, programmers, and designers who created this content?  What an asshole.

I take it you have not heard of secure crypto-processors.  Good luck with that...
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:01:33
The bottom line is that if you invest hundreds of millions of dollars creating content; be it a movie, or a video game, then you have a *right* to have people pay to consume that content.  For people to steal it, is theft, period.  I don't care what kind of tortured arguments libertarians might try to apply.
People have a right to be reimbursed for the content they create.  Maybe copyright law has 'gone too far' in some cases, but that doesn't condone theft.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:07:57
Except that's not what it happening.  Isn't a 'bail-in' when a government dumps money into a bank?  What government printed up a bunch of fresh BTC to 'bail-in' an exchange?
Calling this a 'bail-in' makes no sense at all.  What it is, is theft of customer funds.  No one is being 'made whole' and a whole lot of people are being robbed.

As someone who makes his living creating digital content for sale, I have never understood this expectation on the part of the current generation of internet users that they have some inalienable right to steal content for free.

@_date: 2016-08-30 01:21:26
It's really just the non-technical end users who, frankly, were not treated respectfully during this process. It is important for developers to communicate respectfully with end users even if the things they are asking for are not technically feasible.
The most guilty parties, however, are Mike Hearn and Gavin Anderssen and their naivete about the risks associated with on chain scaling.
Maybe they are right, maybe massive blocks like Gavin's original 20mb proposal are fine. However, you don't do that experiment on a live blockchain holding billions of dollars worth of value.  ETH and the DAO.
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:26:36
I completely agree; but if you try to scale *on-chain* such that bitcoin can function as a global payment network, it would lose it's most important property of being censorship resistant.  That's why we need layer-2 solutions to address that challenge.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:20:14
I am a content creator.  I am employed by a corporation.  The corporation pays my salary, based on the success of the content that I (along with many other people) create.  If people are consuming that content, without paying for it, then my employer (the evil corporation) is unable to continue to pay me a salary.
Let's not pull this faceless corporation bullshit.  Those corporations have employees who would like to have a salary and benefits.  
We aren't talking about some kid strumming a guitar on a subway platform.  We are talking about video games and movies which are the collective effort of thousands of content creators.
People just want to rationalize stealing.  But, back to bitcoin, I'm not sure why anyone of us should be excited that this platform designed to distribute child pornography and stolen digital content, is going to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-29 22:29:26
Nobody is moving the goal posts, this is merely a technical discussion about how we get there.  Do we cram everything into the main blockchain and, therefore, create major technical risk, or do we accomplish these goals through a series of layers in the network protocol providing varying degrees of security and features with each layer?
I argue the second approach is safer.

A lot of people have lost bitcoin with them and they have frequently had bugs. Any browser based wallet is too risky to store more than a tiny amount of bitcoin.

There is no moral argument for stealing.  Why is it that you guys think you can have one argument that makes it valid to steal the work of others but not in other cases?  If someone cuts your hair and you don't pay them for their service, you would know that is morally wrong.  But if that same person creates a song or a movie to sell to people, and you consume it without paying for it, you are totally cool with you?

People often talk about LN 'transactions' but, kind of, technically speaking (a bit of semantics here), it doesn't process transactions in anything like the traditional sense.
What the LN does is simply adjust an existing balance between two parties.  There is only ever *one* transaction, the 'settlement transaction' which establishes the currently agreed upon balance between two parties.
As soon as these two parties issue a new 'transaction', any previous transactions are null, void, and irrelevant; since you are merely updating the signatures to the *single* settlement transaction.
The LN merely manages exchanging signatures between two parties relative to a single existing funding transaction.
Now, since all it does is exchange signatures to funding transactions, **these funding transactions need not exist on the same blockchain**!
If you had two, three, four, a hundred, separate sidechains, then parties could create funding transaction on one or more of them.  By exchanging signatures in a multi-hop system users can effectively 'forward funds' across multiple side-chains.
When I realized this, it just kind of blew my mind.
I wrote an article about it, which you can find here:
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:42:56
That's actually out of date.  They now use 1 millibit.

I've been a professional game developer since 1985.  Over that period of time I have created games, which were sold to consumers, and I have earned a nice living doing so.  The system works fine.  People just want to rationalize why they should get the hard work of others without paying for it.
I pay for all of my digital content.  And I have no problems doing so.  I stream on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play, etc. etc.  It all works just fine, and I pay for the content I consume; be it video games or movies.
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:36:56
So, I actually held a huge stake in GBTC, but I sold it once the price premium exceeded my 'sanity' check limit of somewhere around a 50% premium.  Watching what is happening the past few days is just quite literally insane.  I would really love to own a bitcoin ETF in my retirement portfolio, because obviously, like many, I'm bullish on bitcoin in the future, but I can't get involved in something that doesn't even behave at all rationally.
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:05:13

What not everyone realizes yet, is that the the LN is blockchain agnostic! Since it is merely a mechanism for exchanging signed contracts, this means you can exchange contracts inter-operably across multiple sidechains.
Sidechains + LN to hyperlink them together is the killer scaling combination!
@_date: 2016-04-26 23:09:44
The moment any ETF with liquidity becomes available GBTC will crash, at least to match bitcoin price parity, but probably quite a bit lower, because it's a really sucky asset.   It has terrible liquidity, it's super hard to buy and sell into it, you have to set a limit price only as it's OTC.  The fees are ridiculous as well.

Yes. All it requires is the blockchain has the same cryptographic features required to securely sign the contracts.

The attempted technical explanation of ASICBOOST is wrong.
ASICBOOST is an optimization which made an assumption about the format of the data layout in a bitcoin block. 
If the data layout were to ever change it would invalidate their optimization.
So, while it is true that segwit changed the data layout, really anything devs might have done could have this result. It's not that the change was segwit as much as it simply that it was **any** change.
Now, here's the thing. A SHA256 hash is supposed to operate on any random input data. To optimize your SHA256 algorithm to make **any** assumption about the format of the input data and expect devs to never change the input data format is complete and total horsehit!!!
Two years of lies and misinformation have tried to confuse this simple fact.
Devs can, will, and should be able to change the data format as they wish. Miners should do a proper SHA256 implementation which makes no assumption about the format of the input data!

You say that like it's a 'good thing'.  There is a reason the bitcoin scripting language is so simple and Satoshi disabled most of the experimental opcodes.  It's not an accident.

 It's based on energy multiplied times time. I'm not sure why this is so hard for people to grasp. It requires an enormous amount of energy to mine one bitcoin, just as it costs a lot of energy to mine one ounce of gold. It's not really that difficult of a concept to grasp.

The thing is, if you participate in the regular financial system; meaning you have a job which gives you access to a 401k, then the rules of the game are different.
For example, when I have extra money from my regular paycheck I just buy bitcoin directly.  However, money in my 401k or IRA, I cannot just go out and 'buy' some bitcoins.  The only way I can come close it to purchase GBTC.
If you moved any of your 401k or IRA into GBTC a month or so ago then you are showing a very good return.  Personally, I 'pocketed' (meaning cashed out) a $50k profit trading GBTC just in the past few weeks.
It's hard to time trades perfectly, I could have had a $75k profit had I waited to cash out, but I had no idea there was going to be a big runup in price this weekend.  It could have just as easily been the opposite knowing bitcoin.

SG is a very complex change to the software which puts a massive burden on the entire industry to upgrade their wallets and other systems.  It will break most existing blockchain parsers and explorers.
It's a good idea, and should be implemented, carefully, but it is far more involved than simply changing a single line of code.
Additionally, implementing SG as a soft-fork is far more hacky and dangerous than doing it as a hard fork.
Hard forks, contrary to what is the party line in this forum, are **not** dangerous. In fact, they are far less dangerous.  In the past we have unrolled hard-forks in less than 24 hours when an emergency arose.
Another word for 'hard-fork' is 'software upgrade', and the entire bitcoin community should be capable of upgrading software over time.
Changing a single line of code to adjust the max blocksize from 1mb to 2mb is the simplest and safest change we could possibly make.
I agree with the OP; bumping up to 2mb now so we have some breathing room is the right thing to do.

That shit takes years.  You want to know how I know it takes years? Because it has taken us many years just to get bitcoin infrastructure to the point that it is today; and it will take years for LN to reach the same level of infrastructure integration and support as well.

Full nodes do not process transactions. They validate them.  Only a miner processes transactions.


Right, that is why no one is proposes 1gb blocks.  A 2mb blocksize is modest, and is hardly going to make that big of a difference.  
A 3 terrabyte hard drive costs about $115.
It is also worth noting the SegWit has the same disk space requirements as a 2mb increase.


So, you are against segregated witness too I suppose, since it increases the disk space requirement the same as a 2mb blocksize increase right?


Right, that is why a compromise of 2mb was proposed, rather than something like 20mb which would, arguably, give us a lot more runway.


That is correct. Satoshi envisioned that a fee market would develop as a result of *MASSIVELY* increased number of transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:10:13


To be clear; I am a professional software engineer with over 35 years experience.  I have written several best selling computer games, and contributed code to dozens of others.  I have worked in massive code bases, comprising millions of lines of code in numerous game engines.  I have written a bitcoin blockchain parser, simply so I could more deeply understand how the data is organized and represented.
So, when it comes to these things, I'm hardly the 'pointy haired boss', my comments at least come from well informed engineering perspective.
Saying doubling the transaction volume 'buys very little', is unfair.  Right now people are working on a very complex and high-risk change called SegWit which might, theoretically (we have yet to know what it will accomplish in practice) get us about the same degree of improvement.  It is also important to note that SegWit does, in fact, increase the disk space requirements.  It is just a semantic trick where they break the data out into two different streams; but it is indeed an increase.  Playing a semantic game saying that it isn't making the 'blocksize' larger; but still requiring full nodes to store all of the signature data into a side-car file, is adding a highly complex change to get a similar result as simply increasing the blocksize limit; something far simpler, and lower risk.
SegWit will break all kinds of existing bitcoin applications as they will all have to be rewritten to know how to access the signature data from the side channel.


I don't know why you are against compromise? You sound like the Republicans in the House.   Compromise is how things get done.  
You keep describing a doubling of the transaction capacity of the network as 'no big deal' but it is, in fact, a very big deal.


I thought we were talking about bitcoin?  
Look, if the LN and/or some other sidechain solution existed **today** and was capable of handling all payment transactions in a **decentralized** fashion; and was completely safe, secure, and well integrated into the entire bitcoin ecosystem, then I would be right there with you.  I would be like, hey, let's not change the blocksize limit yet.  Let's include full RBF now.  Let's let a massive fee market develop.
I would be all in, right there with you.
However...such a system does not yet exist, nor will it exist for probably at least two years.
You cannot propose RBF, fee-markets, and a heavily constrained blocksize **UNTIL** an alternative for payment transactions exist in the real world.
Moreover, there is a question of whether or not fee markets should be forced by artificially constraining resources; rather than by letting competing miners determine what fees they will accept for which transactions.  That is a true free market.

How long until it is integrated seamlessly into every bitcoin wallet?

How long until every bitcoin accepting website can seamlessly accept LN payments?
How long until it is seamlessly integrated into every exchange?
How long until the community has the same level of trust using the network that took people years to build up for bitcoin?
Having a 'working' LN is just phase one of a multi year process of having it fully integrated into the entire bitcoin infrastructure.

This is a rambling mess of an article. The straw men in it are so strong they could scare away a murder of crows.
At no point does the article even touch upon the question of direct end user access to the blockchain. Addressing the fact that even if a pegged sidechain could handle 100% of all payment transactions, the current blocksize limits the maximum number of users to have any value to 'peg' in the low millions.
But, sure, this was helpful......
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:31:02


500 bytes per user per six months is 'reasonable' to you?  We have very different concepts of what constitutes 'reasonable'.
You think it is 'reasonable' that people will only need to perform two transactions every six months, four per year?
You think it is 'reasonable' for 100% of the bitcoin network transaction capacity to be used up simply for users to perform four transactions per year? This would mean that, for any new user, they would have to wait, on average, months to get their very first channel opened.  Is that 'reasonable'?
If someone only needs two transactions every six months, how are they supposed to purchase and directly control bitcoins on the blockchain to begin with?
How are they supposed to purchase bitcoin, let's say, every time they get a paycheck?  Are you suggesting that they purchase bitcoin *off chain*!??
How come people only need to open **one** channel?  Does this not assume there is only ever one universal lightning network?  What if they want to open channels on multiple lightning networks, each of which might offer different features or access to certain vendors?  
Also, finally, the math, as I said, was wrong.
If you want to consume 100% of the bitcoin network transaction capacity (currently, on a good day, at 200,000 transactions per day) simply so people can perform two transactions every six months, then the **maximum** number of users who could do this is **NOT** 50 million (as luke-jr and other LN proponents claim) but 18.25 million.  
Of course, if 100% of the bitcoin network transaction capacity was used up for the sole purpose of creating LN channels for 18.25 million people, there would be a continuous non-stop backlog lasting many months.  Not to mention the fact that this leaves no room for users to purchase bitcoin and hold that value directly on the blockchain (i.e. secure their own funds) which means they would have to have an unbelievable level of trust in the LN to both purchase and hold 'bitcoin' off-chain until their settlement transaction, some six months in the future, can actually confirm.
Is this really your vision of a functioning bitcoin network?
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:59:44
I guess you didn't understand what I was trying to say.  Let me be clearer.
I invested in bitcoin based on the belief (from reading the bitcoin white paper and the past five years of development) that bitcoin was going to be a global peer-to-peer electronic cash system.
Currently a small group of individuals (very small) are trying to change it into a settlement layer for the wealthy and banks.  That is **not** what I originally invested in.
This is a problem for me, and many others, so that is why I speak up.
You need to understand, that if bitcoin does become a settlement only layer for big banks, that would imply (if successful) that the value of bitcoin would be very high, much higher than it is today.  If bitcoin was being used by banks as a settlement layer it would have to have a much higher market cap than it was today.
So, if all I cared about was 'getting rich' I would be championing small blocks and a settlement only solution.
However, my attraction to bitcoin began with a lot more than any 'get rich' scheme.  I was attracted to it for far more philosophical reasons, as were many.  When I see the network, which is supposed to be censorship resistant, be taken over by a small group of developers who are trying to turn it into something other than what I originally wanted to be involved in, it concerns me.  A lot.
Contrary to the highly censored view in this sub-reddit, the vast majority of bitcoin users do not want bitcoin to become a settlement only layer or, if they do, they don't want that to happen **until** fully decentralized and trustless layer-2 networks **exist** capable of offloading most payment transactions.
Right now bitcoin is being subverted by a small group of individuals against the wishes of the vast majority of the actual users of the network and against the original vision of the project.

The advantages are that when the bitcoin network has a massive backlog of transactions (estimated to be on the order of months by some LN proponents) you will be able to participate in an eBay style bidding war to get your transaction processed sooner than those stuck in the pool.
Pretty cool feature huh?
It also kills zero confirmation transactions, but with a many month backlog that is to be expected.
The stated goal of LN proponents is that the bitcoin network will only be used to open and close channels to the LN, which they claim only needs to happen roughly once every six months for all possible users.
They are creating a future bitcoin network that looks nothing like the one we have today.

The harsh tone comes as a reaction to a small subset of the community which has been advocating crippling the bitcoin network based on promises of vaporware.  In other words, there is history here.
According to LN supporters they believe that a steady-state where the bitcoin network has a continuous backlog of **SIX MONTHS** of bitcoin transactions is perfectly acceptable, that fee markets should develop such that the average bitcoin transaction costs hundreds of times more than they do today, and that the average user can only perform **TWO** bitcoin transactions every six months; limited by the aforementioned six month backlog of stuck transactions and users will have to participate in a bidding war using replace-by-fee if they want their transaction processed sooner than six months, if ever.
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:04:23
8.3 million people can perform one transaction every 37 days assuming they consume 100% of the capacity of the network.
It takes one transaction to buy some bitcoin, one transaction to open a payment channel, and one transaction to close a channel.
That is 111 days for 8.3 million people each.
Sounds 'usable' to me.....

Yes, GBTC can be converted to bitcoin.  Let me show you how.  Buy shares of GBTC.  Watch price of GBTC go up or down, vaguely correlated to the price of the underlying asset, now sell GBTC and use the cash to buy bitcoins.  In reality, it is rare that a commodity backed ETF can be directly converted back to the original asset.  I mean, it can happen in some cases, but as a general rule people can't just convert shares of a gold ETF into physical bars of gold that get mailed to their house either.

The free market should be based on those who process the transactions; not an artificial resource scarcity which is being imposed by a small centralized group of core developers who are not listening to what the actual users of the network want.
Let's say that there were no blocksize limit at all.  Do you think miners would suddenly begin processing zero fee transactions again, or in a timely fashion?  I doubt it.  
Realize that just because the blocksize limit increases does **not** mean that every miner world-wide will, instantly, start submitting massive blocks filled with zero fee transactions.
The fee market should develop based on different miners competing for fees in the form of transactions.  Adding an artificial capacity constraint breaks the market.

When GBTC first launched there were some insane bids over market price.  Nobody knows why people did something that stupid but, as you can see, the price has stabilized in a narrow range for quite a while. 
Volume of GBTC trading is extremely low as well.  It is still at a substantial price premium over the market price of bitcoin.  It doesn't seem to track bitcoin price changes either; meaning when bitcoin went up 10% (and is now dropping back down again) the price of GBTC stayed the same premium between 28.5 and 29.5; a fairly narrow range.

Ok, let me answer in a bit more detail.
First of all, what problems are being encountered by the transaction malleability bug?  Well, to begin with, it is blocking the lightning network, which requires it to be fixed for it to work.
Second, people have short memories, but it did a lot of damage.  Tell that to the people who lost money when the price collapsed when it was used to hack some users funds?
And, the fact that it hasn't yet been fixed, continues to support the idea that the bitcoin software is 'locked up', unable to deploy significant or real fixes.


I agree that is should be increased. I don't agree that it 'will be'.  There appears to be strong opposition to it, and without near 100% consensus it won't happen.
Right now I hear people talking about 'fee markets' and the bitcoin network being solely used for settlement, rather than as a payment network. 
I shared the same opinion as you for a long time.  I always thought 'we can fix this down the road'.  I am now, based on the current outcome of the blocksize debate, becoming increasingly pessimistic that this network can or will adapt.  Your optimism is great.  I hope you are right.  I wish I could share it.  However, I am becoming increasingly pessimistic that bitcoin is going to be able to adapt to it's growing needs if we ever have any hopes of it becoming a useful world-wide payment network.

According to LN proponents users will only ever open two channels **per year**, pay a substantial fee to do so, and have to wait months for that channel request to be processed due to a massive backlog.  This is the vision of how the LN will work according to This idea that you can just 'open a channel' here and 'open a channel there' presumes that a large population can even do such a thing on the main bitcoin blockchain.
The thing no one seems willing to address is that the current blocksize limit means, at most, only two million people can actively use the bitcoin blockchain directly.  To be clear, I define 'active' as performing just two transactions per **month**.  
In a scenario where fee markets develop and access to the main blockchain is restricted by a massive backlog of transactions, I don't really see how the LN can function for the general public.
While I don't want to see the mythical 'cup of coffee' transactions necessarily happening on the main blockchain, I do want a network which allows the general public to have direct access.

SegWit has the exact same bloat as a 2mb increase.  Simply writing the signatures to a different file on your hard drive is still increasing the data bloat.
It's a hacky and overly complex way to semantically claim you didn't increase the blocksize by writing half the data in the block to another file on disk.

I wanted to give you two small items of feedback. First, one share of GBTC is *not* worth 1/10th of a bitcoin. Since the fund takes a 2% fee out annually, currently one share of GBTC is only worth about 0.095 bitcoin, which is a significant difference.
Another point. While you correctly state that it will be about the year 2140 before all 21 million bitcoins are issued, it is always important to note that, for practical purposes, nearly all of the 21 million will have been issued within the next 20 years. The block reward decreases exponentially, so it will take another century to technically reach the max amount, but for practical purposes most of the currency will have been issued much, much sooner. 
I'm afraid when people use that 2140 number most people assume it is issued at a linear rate.
I wish more articles would state something like, "Within 20 years almost all of the 21 million bitcoins will have been issued."

The 'villians' are the core devs unwilling to compromise and listen to the vast majority of the user base. The issue is that the fundamental economic contract of the bitcoin network is being changed through inaction.
Everyone, nearly everyone else, are the 'good guys' because most of them are willing to compromise in good faith.
The sad part is that through their unwillingness to compromise there is a high probability they will completely lose control of what is currently considered to be the core reference client. Quite frankly, things have gotten so bad that I think that is as important a goal as a blocksize increase at this point.

It takes two transactions for each channel; one to open the channel and another to close the channel.  Since it requires the user to own some bitcoin in the first place to open a channel that is at least one additional transaction for the user to have acquired some bitcoin in the first place which LN proponents fail to account for.  In addition, this begs the question how does the user buy additional bitcoin over time?
Ignoring how the user ever got any bitcoin in the first place to open their first channel, that is still 6 transactions per year to open and close three channels.
You claim this will happen utilizing just 60% of the bitcoin network's transaction capacity of 220,000 transactions per day.
60% of the network's transaction capacity is 48,180,000 transactions per year.  Since you claim that each user will submit 6 transactions per year (open and close three channels and ignoring the question of how the user ever had any bitcoin in the first place without having executed a transaction) that leaves room for 8.03 million users.
You still have not addressed the question of how does anyone acquire bitcoin in the first place without performing a transaction?  It requires that user control some bitcoin to be able to open a channel in the first place.
You have not addressed the question of why 3 channels per year?  What makes four months the magic number?  Why not one channel a week?  Or every two weeks to coincide with when people get their paycheck?  If a user wants to buy some bitcoin with each paycheck and 'settle up' their account, how do they do that if they can only open one channel every four months?
Why do users only need one channel open at a time? Wouldn't users want to have many channels open at the same time representing different business relationships they might have with different entities?
Finally, you don't seem to understand why there would be an extensive backlog.  In your scenario you are suggesting that 60% of the entire transaction capacity of the bitcoin network is being used by 8 million people wanting to open a a channel once every four months.
This means that the average wait time for a new user to get a channel processed is 2 months; 1/2 of the sampling frequency.  
If, on every single day, only the exact number of people try to open a channel, and then, the next day, exact that number of people submit a transaction again, under this artificial non-real world scenario could you possibly avoid the delay.  However, that is not how things work in reality.  If, on the first day, all 8 million people submit a single open channel request, some will wait a year, half will wait more than six months, etc. etc.  The **average** wait time will be 1/2 the sampling rate which, in your example, was once every four months.  So, on average, a typical user will face a 2 month backlog before his open or close channel request is processed.  It's somewhat similar to why a freeway gets backed up when it is heavily congested; even when there is no accident to be found.
What exactly is your background?  Do you work as a software engineer for the lightning network, or did you just read some slides and hear some chatter on reddit?

I don't understand this cart before the horse way of doing things. Can you explain to me why we are not increasing the blocksize now until the LN is actually a reality?
I was really looking forward to OB before, but now things seem very uncertain.
If someone from core or LN could explain how OB is going to work in light of a heavily constrained network, I would love to hear it.
Originally, I thought there was going to be a short term bump in the blocksize, but now I understand that isn't going to happen.
Can someone from OB explain their plans, because I thought it was ready to launch Q1 2016.
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:44:20
I see. So, since the bitcoin network can only process 220,000 transactions per day, then the maximum number of people who can use OB is 220,000 and, at that, only if they pay a high enough fee to get their transaction processed relative to everyone else who also wants to use the network.
I think eBay does a lot more than 220,000 auctions a day, so OB will definitely be constrained to a maximum user base out of the gate.
Well, that sucks, I was really looking forward to using it.

Yes, we need bigger blocks.  Even with the LN we need bigger blocks.  Transaction capacity limits the number of people who can actively hold value directly on the blockchain.  Everyone should be able to  hold and transact value directly on the blockchain.  If someone wants to provide a service that can move some day-to-day payment transaction volume to a second layer, hey, that sounds great.  And many will be happy to use such a system, once it exists, is trusted, and has been fully integrated into the existing ecosystem.
Until then, the bitcoin network must continue to grow to accommodate the users and help increase bitcoin as a trusted value transfer network.
You can take your LN vaporware and come back when it exists in a form that it can actually offload some small percentage of bitcoin transactions from the core network.  Until then, stop advocating crippling the bitcoin network **today** to the point that it is unusable.  And, by unusable, I mean so constrained that there is a backlog of transactions that cannot be processed in a timely manner.

The larger the blocks the more transactions there are in them.  The more transactions there are, the more fees the miner collects.  Each transaction, typically, contains a fee.
Currently, as of today, the total amount of bitcoin fees are only on average only about 10-12 bitcoins per day.
 
The network produces 3600 bitcoins a day as block rewards, so currently the fees are just 0.3% of the total compensation.
This is so low that miners really don't even give a crap about transactions right now.  We frequently get zero transaction blocks because, hey, why bother to include transactions?
If the number of transactions daily rose 20 fold, then the reward would be on the order of 240 bitcoins a day.  Still no where near the mining reward of 3,600 bitcoins, but at least now we are talking 'real money'.
What is particularly important is this.  The mining reward is going to drop in half very soon; in 2016.
After that, because it is exponential, it will keep decreasing rapidly.
The official plan of record is that transaction fees are supposed to make up for the mining reward in the future.  However....if transaction volume doesn't increase then either (a) the fees will be so tiny that miners will lose incentive and the network will drop in security or (b) the fees will have to be raised so high to keep the network running that it will destroy one of the most important benefits of bitcoin; which is the ability to move money inexpensively.
Why miners would be against getting more transaction fees, by processing more transactions, is a mystery to me.
They must know this transition needs to happen relatively soon because the block-halving is, like Winter in the Game of Thrones, most definitely coming soon!

Most objective people believe this as well.  The problem is that it doesn't **exist**.  When it does, and is capable of off-loading a significant amount of day to day bitcoin payment transactions, then we can talk about not raising the block-size limit.
The Lightning Network, as you describe, does not actually exist in reality.  In fact, it probably won't exist in that form for years; due to the amount of time it takes to build out the entire infrastructure.  
In the meantime, until the lightning-network actually exists in concrete form, we need to increase the block-size limit so that bitcoin is not destroyed by basically ceasing to function.  Having massive backglogs in the blockchain, fee markets, and the loss of zero conf transactions, is a horrible, horrible, outcome in the short term.  It will hurt the bitcoin economy and value severely.
Another point you seem to be missing is this.  The blocksize limit, as it exists today, restricts active users of the bitcoin network to no more than about two million people (and that is being very generous by defining an 'active user' as someone who only performs two transactions per month).
Let us imagine that, today, the lightning network existed in flawless and perfect form.  A lightning network which could process a hundred billion, trillion, zillion, transactions per second per day.
Guess how many **people** could actually use it?  Only about two million.  
There are some who will claim the real number is 50 million, but that is a lie.  Even using their absolute most absurd optimistic numbers, where people are considered to be 'actively' using the bitcoin network by only performing 4 transactions per year, that is still only about 12.5 million users.  And, that assumes that 100% of the entire bitcoin network is consumed simply opening and closing channels with an average wait time of 3 months per person!
So, for the lightning-network to work, the block-size must increase dramatically simply to accommodate more human beings capable of holding value on the blockchain to open and close channels to begin with.

Yes, the network can run using a fraction of the current hashing power, but that would result in a great loss in security.

However, that will either result in vastly higher fees or a huge drop in the utility and security of bitcoin. Neither outcome is desirable.

Here's is Andreas repeating, as he has many times before, that bitcoin scaling is 'no big deal'.
And, directly from the bitcoin wiki, as it has been there for years:
"With some modifications to the software, full Bitcoin nodes could easily keep up with both VISA and MasterCard combined, using only fairly modest hardware (a single high end server by todays standards). It is worth noting that the MasterCard network is structured somewhat like Bitcoin itself - as a peer to peer broadcast network."
The claim that bitcoin can easily scale continues here:
One thing about scaling, is that people haven't done the math to figure out just how impossible it would be for hundreds of millions of people to have any value stored on the main bitcoin blockchain.  Even if they were going to use blockstream or the lightning network for the bulk of their transactions, simply having value stored on the blockchain itself would be incredibly difficult with those kinds of numbers.  And, if you imagine billions of people rather than 'merely' hundreds of millions, it becomes truly absurd.
My point is, that even if off-chain transactions end up doing the heavy lifting for small day to day transaction processing, you still need to scale up substantially for a large population to have some value stored on the core blockchain itself.
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:42:26

Why does everyone seem to assume that the lightning network will work to offload transactions from the main bitcoin network in a timely fashion?
It will take years, if ever, for the LN to have the level of integration necessary to be able to handle this transition.
If the LN network existed **today**, and if it were integrated into payment providers, wallets, exchanges, and the entire infrastructure top to bottom, to such an extent that I could seamlessly use it between exchanges, wallets, and merchants, that would be one thing.
But it is **not** ready today.  In fact, it is unknown if it will ever be ready.  For us to change the fundamental economics of the bitcoin network based, solely, on the promises of a technology which will not exist in concrete form for years, is definitely a legitimate concern.
How long will it take for people to gain the level of trust in LN as they have with bitcoin today?  How do we know that LN hubs and operators will not be forced to comply with AML/KYC and all of the things people complain about Circle and Coinbase today?
I don't think anyone in the bitcoin community wants to have a 'fee market' develop due to the promises of something that doesn't exist and won't exist in a usable form for years, if ever.

Hard forks, or software upgrades, should be a normal part of the healthy development of bitcoin.  Virtually all software has regular upgrades over time.  Bitcoin should as well.  It is also a way to make sure that node operators and miners are running more current software.
You start with the assumption that hard forks (software upgrades) are somehow 'bad', but I simply don't accept that premise.
Bitcoin has been hard forked in the past, and it should probably be hard forked at regularly scheduled intervals (on the order of once every 18-24 months) in the future.

I don't think there are really that many eXTremists out there.  What you see as 'eXTremists' is really mostly a reaction to what has been happening with core.  A large portion of the bitcoin community feels that they are being betrayed and ignored.  The fact that core won't even do something as simple and trivial as bumping the blocksize to 2mb is evidence of that.
Most everyone wants a compromise solution.  As things progress, more people simply want the main reference client to no longer be in the hands of a centralized group of individuals who are ignoring the wishes of the larger community.

Sidechains assume an individual has value stored on the main blockchain. The main blockchain can only support a tiny population to hold any value to be pegged, and pegging itself generates transactions.
This will allow us to scale from a few hundred thousand users to a few million. Still very niche.

Simple answer, they cannot and will never be able to own any actual bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-12-30 00:18:21
It's simple. Just ask yourself this question. How much code do you have to change to support a blocksize increase? Answer, one line. What is the chance it will break anything else? Almost zero.
SegWit, while a potentially interesting solution to the transaction malleability bug, would require massive amounts of complex code changes and would have ripple effects up and down the entire ecosystem.
Also, both approaches increase the data requirements to store the blockchain on a full node. Both.

He is missing a key point. Ignore the question of whether or not bitcoin can, or should be, used to buy a coffee. Instead, simply ask 'how many people can even use it all, for anything'?
The answer to that question, considering the current transaction limit, is not that many people, not that many people at all.
The number of people who can feasibly access the bitcoin network, irregardless of fee amount, is only a few million.
If bitcoin cannot handle representing value for more than a few million people, then it is nothing but a novelty toy for a small group of tech nerds.
Anyone interested in the success of bitcoin should, at least, hope that hundreds of millions, if not billions of people, should be able to store value on the network.
So, stop counting cups of coffee and start counting people. It's not that many with a 3tps limit!
@_date: 2015-12-23 04:35:35
Why not? Because it doesn't exist.
You do realize that for the lightning network to work it must share all of the same decentralized principals, security, and trust as the bitcoin network itself?
If the LN contains large centralized hubs in data centers, then the parties that run those nodes could be considered money service businesses and be required to implement AML/KYC and expose the operators to legal risk.
It will be a very long time until a large decentralized LN will exist which the community trusts enough to park more than a very tiny amount of value into.
It will take years for wallets, exchanges, and payment providers to fully integrate the LN as a seamless payment channel.
The LN is an exciting technology, but don't confuse the idea with reality. It is a long, long, road from an idea to a network that can accomplish all of these functions in the real world. It may succeed, it may fail, it may end up not being as big a deal as anyone imagined. What we do know is that it will take **years** before it could possibly be fully integrated into the ecosystem.
It took over five years for bitcoin to get where it is today, with a lot of hard battles won and lost. To think that the LN will not face a similar battle is naive and hopelessly optimistic.
I still worry about the State attacking bitcoin, I'm even more concerned that the State will attack the LN as well.
Yes, the LN is exciting technology, but acting like it is a given and assured success and solution when it is years away from that potential is irresponsible.

It is a regular debit card that you can use anywhere, but it is funded via bitcoin.  When you make a charge, the vendor/provider of the card will convert bitcoin to USD at the spot market price.  Ideally you can also 'hot-load' the card, so that you only keep as much bitcoin on the card as you need for any given purchase.
Sadly, the only card which has all of these features is Xapo, and they are not available in the US due to our absurd regulatory environment.

And, the point I have been trying to raise, is that even if we had perfectly integrated off-chain solutions you still need/want to peg them to value stored on the bitcoin network; and the current bitcoin network can, at most, handle a few million people holding any value at all. The blocksize has to increase simply to make room for a larger population of users.

@_date: 2015-12-15 16:22:57


I see no downsides to increasing the blocksize to 2x; which would immediately double transaction capacity in the short term.
In the long term, even if layer-2 solutions can handle 100% of all payment transactions, if you still want individual human beings (not corporations and wealthy individuals solely) to be able to hold value directly on the bitcoin network, then the blocksize will need to be increased many fold.
Not for cups of coffee, but simply so that people can safely and securely hold value directly on the bitcoin network.
On this sub-reddit LN network proponents have seriously, and with a straight face, claimed that having a steady state of a a **SIX MONTH** backlog of active transactions on the bitcoin network is a perfectly acceptable state that we should be working towards.
So, let's all just agree that no matter how many transactions you shove off to the side for cups of coffee and micro-payments, individual *people* have a right to be able to access the bitcoin network directly to hold and store value.
@_date: 2015-12-05 16:38:50
It only makes sense if the card can be hot loaded, that way you only keep as much bitcoin on it at any given time as you expect to need for specific purchases. I believe you can do this with the Xapo card.

So, let me get this clear, my credibility has taken a hit because I have pointed out basic facts and flaws with the current state of the system? If anything my credibility should go up.
For many years we were told that the scalability problem was no big deal and easily solved. Yet, in practice, absolutely nothing has been done and the community is frozen unable to make any changes.
That isn't a good thing. If we cannot address the scalability problem then bitcoin cannot achieve its initial promise.
And don't start talking about 'fee markets'. If sending a transaction on the network is going to be expensive, so much for helping out the worlds unbanked.

The only part of lightning which 'is bitcoin' is when you open a channel, and when you close a channel.  Everything else happens on a layer-2 network which has:
* No integration into existing bitcoin wallets
* Has no integration into existing bitcoin exchanges
* Has no integration into existing bitcoin payment processors (BitPay, Coinbase, etc.)
* Has no integration into existing websites which accept bitcoin currently.
* Has no integration into existing blockchain explorers, and other supporting infrastructure we have come to expect for bitcoin.  
* Has no trust from the community; trust takes a long time.

Off-chain solutions on centralized services are no solution at all. Bitcoin is a decentralized system which allows people to control their own money. Centralized off-chain systems are simply banks, the user does not directly control their own private keys.

Miners today currently earn over $8 per transaction. The sender of the transaction doesn't pay that amount, instead it is built into the quickly diminishing block reward. If fees are ever going to replace the blockchain reward then the network must be able to handle orders of magnitude more transactions per block.
You think an $8 fee to pay for a cup or coffee or make any small purchase online is reasonable on the bitcoin network? I think not.
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:26:03
Bitcoin was always meant to be a payment network, not a settlement network. That is why we spent years telling people about the low fees and fought for merchants to accept it as a form of payment. It was supposed to empower the billions of unbanked people.
Now it is to be a high fee settlement network only accessible by large offchain corporations.

Lighting network and other side chain proposals assume pegging to some actual value on the main network. Do the math. Take one billion and divide it by the daily transaction volume of the bitcoin network and you will see that it is impossible for that many people to peg any value on the core blockchain.
Even if transaction processing happens in a side chain there isn't enough bandwidth for a billion people to hold any value on the core blockchain.
Only a limited population can actually hold any bitcoin on the core network.
Also, if you cannot store value in the network, or use it as a payment network, what is the point?

Since the inception of bitcoin the question has always been, "what happens if it becomes widely used" and, the answer has always been, we can scale up the block size to deal with it.  Always. 
It is broken.  Currently bitcoin is a fringe payment network which is not widely used.  If you have any hopes of bitcoin ever becoming a successful global payment network then it must scale up.
Also, and this is probably the most important point, is that bitcoin transactions are currently subsidized by the block reward.  The block-reward diminishes exponentially over time, and it's about to halve very soon.
As of today every single bitcoin transaction has an effective 'fee' of about $8.  The actual fees, the ones included in the transactions, are negligible.
We have been told, once again since the start of bitcoin, that when the block reward decreases, it will be made up for by transaction fees.  Now, seriously, do you want to pay $8 to send a single bitcoin transaction?  Because that is what it is going to cost if you don't increase the transaction capacity.
I cannot understand why bitcoin miners are not heavily in favor of increasing the block-size.  They must realize that their long term survival is based on transaction fees and, if the total number of transactions are low, then the fees will be low.
I don't understand why everyone seems to be objecting to what has always been the stated plan since day one.  The stated plan was that, over time, the transaction volume would increase and transaction fees would replace the block-reward.
However, if we keep the transaction volume low, then it will end up costing us each $8 or more just to send a single transaction on the bitcoin network!  This will, quite obviously, kill bitcoin as a payment network!

People forget that sidechains and payment channels still require settlement transactions directly on the blockchain. It helps with scaling, a little bit, but not much; because the transaction limit on the bitcoin network is so low that even with sidechains only a very small percentage of the population could even have entries on the main blockchain to begin with. Do the math.
This means that everyone, the general population, will be forced onto centralized third party solutions which, in turn, means we lose nearly every benefit bitcoin was supposed to deliver in the first place.

GBTC does not affect the price of bitcoin; it is too low volume and there are insufficient arbitrage opportunities.  However, each share of GBTC represents 1/10th of a bitcoin and, therefore, the price should always at least match the current market price of bitcoin.

I'm actually cool with off-chain solutions taking over the vast bulk of the daily transaction processing.  Actually, I'm hugely in favor of that.  My concerns are as follows:
* Off block-chain solutions are not ready yet.
* Even if off block-chain solutions existed, they are not yet integrated into all of the software infrastructure yet.  Meaning, you should be able to use your existing bitcoin wallet software and have it seamlessly integrate into off-chain solutions.  You shouldn't even need to know that it is using such technologies, it should 'just work'.  How long until we are there?  Probably years.
* Even if off-chain solutions exist, and are integrated into all of the various payment software infrastructure, there is still a problem.  Off-chain solutions still perform settlement on the blockchain; meaning to use them you still need to have some value on the core blockchain.  The current transaction volume limits do not scale to hundreds of millions, or most definitely billions, of people being able to peg any value on the blockchain.  Many will say 'this is just fine' because third party centralized solutions will be made available; but that would just be traditional banking as we have it today; not something I'm very interested in supporting.
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:26:55
You do realize that the lightning network is based off of the notion that the user can create a payment channel ON VALUE STORED ON THE BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN!?
With the current existing block size limit only a few million people, at most, can have *any* value stored on the blockchain.
This isn't even about day to day transaction processing, this is about how many human beings (much less machines, exchanges, scripts, bots, corporations, etc.) can gain any access to the network.
To protect bitcoin you want to limit it to a few million users who have to pay exorbitant transaction fees for the privilege!?

It is for exactly this reason that miners should be clamoring for a block-size increase!  Their long term survival depends on transaction fees, not the block reward.
Maybe everyone isn't aware of this but, as of today, every single bitcoin transaction nets a miner an $8 payout.  We, the users of the network, get to piggy back nearly for free because of the block-reward.  However, as the block-reward decreases, it must be replaced with fees.
Do you really want to pay $8 to send a transaction on the bitcoin network?  I don't think so.  But miners are going to expect that kind of payment, or have certainly grown to expect that.
Now, if we increase the block-size substantially ,then the fees can finally begin to take over as the real 'reward'.
Why aren't miners clamoring for the block-size increase?  Don't they want more fees?  Don't they realize the writing is on the wall and the block-reward is going away, quite soon?  If we don't have a concrete plan to replace the block-reward with transactions fees, the network will die.  
I don't know about you, but I'm not going to use the bitcoin network if it costs an $8 fee to send a single transaction.

@_date: 2015-12-15 17:20:11


This conversation was absolutely 'in context' and it was with the infamous 'luke-jr'.  I can dig up the thread if you want, but really what is the point?


It is true that striking a balance between blocksize and keeping the network decentralized is a valid concern.  However, a few points here.  First of all, the bitcoin network is already insanely centralized today.  So, if you care about decentralization, we should probably start discussing what, if anything, we can do about that.  The only reason there are thousands, if not tens of thousands, more full bitcoin nodes has almost nothing to do with blocksize.  The reason there are not already tens of thousands of full nodes is because of (a) pool mining which does not require individual miners to run a full node and (b) because there is zero financial incentive for non-miner nodes to run one.
How much bandwidth or diskspace the bitcoin node consumes has almost no bearing on the matter.  Disk space is cheap.  Bandwidth is cheap.  Really cheap.  Way, way, way, cheaper than what tens of thousands of miners are already spending on hardware and electricity costs to provide hash rate.
There is no reason to believe, at this time, that a modest increase in blocksize would affect the number of full nodes.  I'm all for more full nodes and for more miners who are providing hashing power to the network to be doing full validation.  How do we make that happen, when it has almost nothing to do with blocksize to begin with?
At any rate, I'm not against things like the LN taking over 100% of payment transactions.  In fact, I'm a big fan.  Can't wait for it to happen.  However.....even in a future where 100% of payment transactions happen on layer-2 networks, you still are going to want individuals to be able to hold value directly on the blockchain.
I'm not sure if you have counted lately, but there are a whole lot of people on the planet earth.  Like 7 billion. 
Now, I'm not expecting all 7 billion people to be able to hold value on the bitcoin network tomorrow.  But, let's say two million?  That is the current limit for the number of people who can actively participate on the existing bitcoin network today.
Luke-jr, and others have repeated this nonsense claim, that 50 million people can actively use the bitcoin network with a 1mb blocksize limit; just so long as they only perform two transactions every six months.
There are a number of problems with this statement.  First of all, the numbers themselves simply don't add up.  However, even if they did, it assumes that 100% of the bitcoin network capacity is used up with a six month backlog of transactions, just so 50 million people can open and close one payment channel twice a year.
These kinds of claims are so absurd that it becomes difficult to take LN promoters very seriously.

Here's my version of the conspiracy theory.
First, imagine that there are groups of extremely wealthy people and/or organizations who want to buy as much bitcoin as humanly possible but, of course, at the lowest possible price.
These wealthy investors could buy all of the bitcoin that they can off exchanges (direct from miners and payment processors for example).  If the price of bitcoin starts to go up organically on the exchanges, they can just dump a small amount of their bitcoin holdings to dampen the enthusiasm.
This is just a wacky conspiracy theory of course.  Personally, I want the price to stay low up to the point that there is a general bitcoin ETF available like 'COIN'.
Currently GBTC trades at too much of a premium and is not very liquid.
Maybe there isn't a bunch of pent up demand from investors wanting to buy into bitcoin with their Etrade and Fidelity accounts.  Or maybe there is.  Time will tell.

Now that they have real funding, can they make a commitment to make sure that their marketplace can be curated? I want to make sure that people can consciously subscribe to certain markets and stay out of others.  Those markets that you do subscribe to should be able to to be curated by a community.  This can work just like arbitration works, you have a reputation based system for market moderators who can take down spam and off-topic stuff.
If you want to subscribe to illegal drugs, well, good for you.  But, if you don't, then you should feel safe from being bombarded with illegal marketplaces and spam.
If it ends up becoming a cess-pool of dark-web style illegal trading sites, I don't want to have anything to do with it.
The authors always say they can't control what people put on it.  That's fine, but they can create a system where the community can decide what marketplaces they want to be a part of and which ones they don't, as well as a mechanism for the community to moderate the listings which show up.
Without good moderation and spam prevention, this Open Bazaar will either be unsearchable or a cesspool of noise.

What a ridiculous amount of hyperbole and misrepresentation.
First of all, raising the block-size limit was, and always has been, the plan of record to deal with scalability.
In this article the author claims 'there is no problem' when, in fact, there is.  He wants fee markets to emerge so transactions are processed by the highest bidder, and everyone else is priced out of the network.
At the current transaction limit the bitcoin network can, at most, handle only a few million users and, even then, that is assuming those few million people are making very few transactions.
Is this anyone's ideal of success for bitcoin?  A network that can only handle a few million people at most?  Even with raising the block-size by an order of magnitude, we only open up the bitcoin network to a few tens of millions of people; better, but hardly world domination.
I don't think anyone should feel satisfied that the bitcoin network will only ever support a few million users.

I used to be a moderator on I was relieved of my duties for sharing my views. I wrote an article and did a podcast on LTB on this topic as well.
I am now a moderator on and I keep trying to get this message of compromise out there to anyone who will listen.
The most ironic part is that I am actually in favor of nearly everything the lightning network supporters are promoting.
I believe 100% of all payment transactions should move to layer-2 networks. I believe the blocksize should be constrained so that it grows no larger than is necessary to be used as a purely settlement network but, with this caveat, it must be big enough that any *individual person* can hold their own value directly on the blockchain and are not required to use a 3rd party service.
I support full RBF and fee markets.
Where I differ is that I don't think we should add any of these constraints or change the fundamental economics of the network **until** fully decentralized, fully trusted, fully immune to capture by regulators, fully tested, and fully implemented layer-2 solutions exist and not a minute sooner.
Crippling and changing the economics bitcoin today based on the hopes of some future technology that will take years to develop and may never work is madness, and I won't support it. Not until it has been through the same trial by fire the bitcoin network has gone through.
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:29:18
Think about it this way.  Let's not talk about buying a cup of coffee for a moment, let's just consider how many human beings can buy some bitcoins and hold value on the blockchain.  
Let's say that, to do that, they will perform an average of just 10 transactions per year.
It's hard to believe, but at the current rate of about 100k transactions per day, only 3.65 million people could even submit 10 transactions per year.
With a block size increase to 8mb, at least we have the possibility of getting that raised to tens of millions of people.  
If you wanted one billion people to perform 10 transactions each, it would take them 273 years to get their transactions processed at the current transaction levels today.
One billion people times ten transactions each is ten billion.  Divided by 100,000 transactions the network processes per day gets you to 100,000 days; or 273 years.

You are correct, the $30 figure is wrong, because it is based on old numbers when the transaction volume was lower and the price of bitcoin was higher.
We must first realize that the block reward is going away.  People like to cite the 2140 number but, in reality, the block-reward will diminish to a minuscule level in less than 20 years.  Fees are supposed to replace the block reward.
So, currently miners receive 3,610 bitcoins a day for the service of processing transactions; that's 3,600 for the block reward and about 10 bitcoins in transaction fees.
That means that miners earn around $902,500 a day for processing around 100,000 transactions.  This means they earn about $9 per transaction.
After the block-halving, the average transaction fee will need to rise to $4.50 per for the miners to earn the same reward as they do now.
It is *not* $30 per transaction, that was my bad, I was citing an old number.  That is what it was back when the price of bitcoin was over $1,000 and the number of daily transactions were lower.  Today it is about $9 per transaction.

And were you gambling?  Were you sending funds directly from you coinbase account to a gambling website?  
Assuming that you did this, then you made several mistakes.
Mistake   Online gambling is illegal in the US; so you must have been knowingly doing an illegal activity.
Mistake  : If you are going to knowingly use bitcoin to do illegal activity, then you sure shouldn't do it from a regulated account; as this, obviously, violates the terms of service.
Not that I would recommend that you be doing anything illegal, but if you are going to do so, then you should not be purchasing your bitcoins from a regulated exchange and, even worse, you shouldn't be using a regulated exchange as a wallet.
This is some pretty common sense stuff.  I'm not sure why anyone should act surprised, or annoyed, that Coinbase is required to do these things if they intend to stay in business and not send their executives to jail or be fined out of existence.

The only arbitrage opportunity for GBTC is that a qualified investor can sell shares at a premium and then he can take the fiat out to buy more bitcoin than he started with; either on the open market or by reinvesting in BIT.  It's a way for them to increase their bitcoin holdings.
With COIN, if it ever comes online and if it becomes a huge big deal, then eventually it will use up the Winklevoss twins stash and they will have to execute buy orders on the open market.  What that happens (if it ever happens) that would create buy pressure and the price should increase.
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:41:11

I agree with you that the solution for large scale transactions absolutely should be offchain.  However....for offchain to work, the user must have some value on the main blockchain to begin with.  And, with the current transaction limit, only a relatively small number of people (on a global basis) can have *any* value represented on the blockchain at all.
Of course things like ChangeTip and Coinbase don't have this problem.  Now, I'm a fan of things like ChangeTip, because a centralized off-chain service which deals with only tiny amounts of money, doesn't bother me that much.  For larger amounts of value, centralized off-chain systems like Coinbase, are merely just a repeat of the existing banking system which I thought we all wanted to avoid.

Yes, you can. In fact you can change **anything** in your own copy of the code. Not only could you raise the blocksize limit, you could change the block reward, the difficulty, the number of bitcoins in existence, you could even generate transactions that give you a trillion zillion dollars of bitcoin.
The thing is, if you mined such a block and submitted it to the network, every other miner on the planet would reject it. You would have to convince the majority of the miners on the planet to run your version of the code with these rule changes and, as my British friends like to say, "not bloody likely".
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:50:30
GBTC did like 1,100 bitcoins in one day about a week ago. It had no effect on the price.
There is a slight arbitrage opportunity for BIT holders, as they can 'sell their GBTC at a loss', but at a premium over current market prices. Then they can immediately buy bitcoin on the open market or more BIT shares and get 30% more bitcoins than they started with.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:02:15
I'm ok with fee markets, up to a point.  One of bitcons major selling points is as a low cost payment network.  I'm ok with paying 2 cents to have my transaction processed; maybe even 10 cents, but that is starting to get a bit high for small transactions.

You can never know for sure, but you can make some estimates based on statistical probability. The biggest question is are Satoshi's coins 'lost forever' or merely in hibernation. Until he moves them there is no way to know for sure.
Assuming Satoshi's bitcoins are lost forever (a huge and probably unsafe assumption) it is probably around 12% or so.

I never said it did.  What I said is that the current blocksize limit represents an upper bound for the maximum number of users of bitcoin.  Even if you only want it to serve as a 'store of value', only a relatively small number of people worldwide can access it.
This is the scaling problem I am most concerned about; making room for more people, not cups of coffee.

What you call 'constant negativity' is also called facing reality.  I have worked on software projects my whole life.  And, there were plenty of times when managers made wildly optimistic schedules which were completely disconnected from reality and, as always happens, reality wins and those schedules went out the window and, sadly, a lot of engineers suffered for this very poor planning.
You want me to to provide solutions?  Ok, yeah, sure.
Here is my solution.  Adopt a modest blocksize increase for the next several years to give time for things like the LN to grow and mature.  We should not change the fundamental economics of bitcoin (i.e. continuous backlog, loss of zero-conf, and fee markets) based on the hopes of a technology which doesn't exist yet.
When the LN exists, is integrated widely in the infrastructure, then we can discuss how we can not raise the blocksize limit since layer 2 networks can take care of day to day payment transactions.
This is me offering a practical and realistic solution.
Unlike others, I do not support bitcoin-xt (101).  I do not believe that the bitcoin blocksize should grow so large that it can accommodate all of the microtransactions and payment transactions for the entire planet earth.  However, until we have layer-2 solutions in place, we can't break bitcoin today.

I don't get the comment 'fractional size'. The correct answer is the vast number of zombie coins which never move and are most likely lost forever.

@_date: 2015-06-20 18:07:51
I don't understand the question?  It's basic math.  If transaction fees are supposed to replace the block-reward then the transaction fees must rise substantially unless the block-size is increased.  
If you want to send bitcoins on the network for say a 4 cent transaction fee after the block-halving, then the network would need to process 11.25 million transactions a day, or 112 times more than it does currently.

That 'logic' is silly.  It doesn't matter. If you held your bitcoin for a long period of time to ultimately achieve your life goals, you are a holder.  The US government is going to charge you taxes on that purchase (in USD) whether you bought a house 'directly' with bitcoin or it got converted to USD along the way.

So, we constantly hear people freaking about because they bought into bitcoin at $1,000 or $800 and then the price is lower and they feel like they have 'lost all of their money'.  The truth is they have only lost money if they choose to sell at a loss.
A common piece of advice shared here frequently is to use 'dollar cost averaging'.  Sure, maybe you bought some bitcoins at $1,000 apiece, but if you also bought a bunch at $350 apiece, your average is going to be a lot lower.  This has generally been considered a good strategy for the long term investor.  
So, just for the heck of it, I looked at my own personal spreadsheet of all of my bitcoin buys since December 3, 2013 when I bought 200mbtc (0.2 bitcoins) at $1,077.45 apiece.
For the record, my actual dollar average price is much, much, lower since I was buying bitcoins throughout most of 2013.
However, to be fair, this is a record of my own purchases over the last three and a half months.  You will note that I bought more when the price was down than I did when the price was on the rise.
There was no particular hard rule to this, I just bought when I had some extra money and the price was falling and it seemed like a buying opportunity.  Other times I bought just because I wanted some bitcoin to spend on purchases.
You will note that, as of today, (and of course that could change tomorrow), I am only down 6% since having bought in at over $1,000 per bitcoin.
Everyone needs to decide for themselves how they want to invest, but I thought this was an interesting real-world example of dollar averaging at work.
My average purchase price over the last 3 1/2 months for a total of 19.88 bitcoins was $533 per bitcoin, which is only showing a slight loss at today's price.

That is a valid point. People still do drugs. Also, millions of lives are ruined because of the fact that the government makes drugs illegal and people end up in prison or otherwise enmeshed in the criminal injustice system.
Just because you can't technically stop people doesn't mean they can't put people in jail, make their lives a living hell, and prevent all non-black market use.

I have been a long time customer of Amazon and I am also a member of Amazon prime.  I plan to continue to be a customer as well.  However, I think you should be aware that recently I have been doing most of my online shopping at Overstock.com and TigerDirect.
The reason I have made this change is because these two sites accept bitcoin as a payment method and Amazon.com does not.
My preferred method of payment for *all* online transactions is bitcoin.  The reason for this is because of the incredible risk of using credit cards online.  Over the past several years I have had my credit card number stolen three times and also had to get new cards issued because of data breaches like the one that recently happened with Target.
Credit cards are fundamentally not secure.  They are incompatible with the modern day Internet.  All someone needs is your credit card number and they can start making fraudulent charges.
Even though the credit card companies say that you are not liable for those charges, which is true, it is still a giant hassle and an incredible violation of privacy.
On a matter of principle I will no longer use a credit card for any online transaction unless I can avoid it.  Until Amazon changes their policy, I will continue to use other companies for most of my online purchases; even if they have a slightly higher price.  I also refuse to make a single penny donation to any online charity unless they accept bitcoin.  I will not give up my personal information or put myself at risk simply to make an online purchase any more.
I really love Amazon, but the company was built on the Internet and should, in my opinion, be adopting the most secure payment system ever invented for the Internet which is bitcoin.

It is fair because you are comparing one payment network against another. The prevailing narrative today is that we shouldn't think of bitcoin as a payment network. To which I call bullshit. For years we have been selling bitcoin as an efficient low cost payment network and now people are changing the script. Could it be a settlement network with all transaction processing happing on off blockchain centralized networks? Sure, it could, but that isn't what I was sold or signed up for.

* This contest is now closed * There is still one remaining bonus question out there with a 5mbtc prize is you want to try it.  
To further education about BIP38 encoding of paper wallets, I am providing a fun trivia contest that people can play.  This is the second one of these I have done.  I tried to make the questions harder this time since the last one ended very quickly.  I am also posting this one later in the day to give (hopefully) more people a shot at it.  
An important note, if you think this is fun and want to tip me, please do not.  Instead find one of the public key addresses to one of the questions which hasn't been answered yet and send a tip there instead to increase the prize pay out. 
*NOTE* Since I posted this late, right before I'm heading to bed, I won't be able to update this as questions are answered and prizes are claimed through the night. Before you waste your time trying to answer a question, check the link first to make sure somebody else didn't already snarf it.  When I wake up tomorrow I will update this post with the answers to those which have been claimed.
I have created 9 paper wallets in BIP38 encoding.  The pass-phrase for each wallet is the answer to a trivia question.   At the end of this post are detailed instructions about how I created this trivia contest in case you want to make your own.  The funds to sponsor this contest were donated by me, simply because I thought it might be interesting and fun.  Also, I would like to encourage other people to use BIP38 wallets, learn about the mechanics of bitcoin paper wallets, and for general education.  I probably won't do another one after this. Hopefully I will have inspired some people to take this game to the next level with better questions, better prizes, and better graphics.  Question  has a 31.11111 millibit prize because it is especially hard.  If you win one of the prizes I will need your social security number so I can file a 1099 form with the IRS (that was a joke!)
* What is BIP38 encoding?
BIP38 encoding is a way to create a bitcoin paper wallet that needs a password to unlock.  You can read more about it here.
* How can I test whether my answer works or not?
The easiest way is to use the 'Add Private Key' option under the 'Import / Export' key option on the blockchain.info website.
The trivia questions are in the *Jeopardy* style format, meaning you must answer in the form of a question.
* Each pass phrase will begin with 'What is', 'Who is', and 'What are'
* Each pass phrase will end, and must include, a question mark
* All of the questions are bitcoin themed so you should try to think of what bitcoin related topic, phrase, person, or business might best match the hint.
* Case sensitivity and punctuation are important.  For example, if the answer is a proper name, then the proper name will be capitalized.  If there is an initial, it will have a period.  If there is a list of items, it might have commas between them.  Some of the punctuation may be non-obvious and that is intentionally part of the challenge of the question.
* Some of these are easy, some should be more difficult.
* Once someone has claimed the funds I will update this post accordingly.
* I have confirmed that all of these keys are valid and the exact response will unlock the key.
* This is important!!! You *must" spend the money to claim the prize!! Just guessing the password isn't enough, you have to take the bitcoins too!!!
* You can test a BIP38 password if you have a blockchain.info wallet, just use 'import private key' and paste the private key in.  If you have a Mycellium wallet, you can scan the private key QR code and then enter you guess. If you are doing this on a mobile device, it's quite slow and not a very good way to do it.  I'm sure there are other options as well.

Block 170 is the famous block in the bitcoin blockchain which represented the first time any one person ever sent bitcoin to another person.  In this case it was the creator of bitcoin, Satoshi, who sent it to famous cryptography expert Hal Finney.

* Detailed instructions for how I created this BIP38 trivia quiz
* Step  : Create a set of questions and answers
* Step  : go to 
* Step  : Move your mouse around until it goes to the next page
* Step  : Select 'Paper Wallet'
* Step  : Enable the checkbox 'BIP38 Encrypt?'
* Step  : Change Addresses to generate to 1
* Step  : Change Addresses per page to 1
* Step  : Enter the answer to the first question in the text field marked 'Passphrase'
* Step  : Click on the 'Generate' button
* Step  : Hit Shift+PrintScreen
* Step  : Launch Microsoft Paint or some other image editing program
* Step  : Paste the screenshot
* Step  : Crop the image to just the wallet image
* Step  : Save the image to disk
* Step  : Repeat steps 8-14 for all questions so that you have one image for each question
* Step  : In Microsoft Paint or some other image editing software, copy/paste all of the images onto a single page
* Step  : Above each image enter the text for the trivia question
* Step  : Save this image to disk
* Step  : Use a QR reader to scan the public and private key for every question and add them to your trivia question sheet
* Step  : Go to 
* Step  : Click on Wallet and login to your blockchain.info wallet, if you don't have one create one.
* Step  : Click on Import / Export
* Step  : Click on the button that says 'I Understand'
* Step  : Click on Add Private Key
* Step  : On the dialog box labeled 'Encrypted Private Key' enter the password (trivia question answer) that you used when you created the paper wallet in step 
* Step  : The password should be accepted and imported into your wallet.  If the password fails, then you screwed up somewhere along the way and you should repeat the steps to regenerate that encrypted wallet.
* Step  : Note, by importing the private key you now have the ability to spend any funds stored in those keys.  If you are sponsoring a trivia contest, obviously the point is to let the winner spend them.  You are only importing the keys yourself here for two reasons.  First, so that you can verify that your wallet works.  It would suck if you made a mistake and somebody spent a bunch of time trying to guess the answer and they never could because the wallet was bad.  The second reason you import the key is so that you can get a notification when someone successfully answers the question and 'sweeps' (spends) the money.
* Step  : Send money to each key that you have verified which will be the prize reward.  Obviously you should not send the money (bitcoins) until you have first verified that the encrypted key is correct and the answer to the trivia question has been unlocked.
* Step  : Post your contest!!  I have now done two of these and they each took my about two hours to set up.  Obviously someone could make a piece of software that would automate this process.  It's an interesting demonstration about how you can pay out prize money to people using bitcoin and BIP38 encoding.  As someone with a background in the game industry, I did find this to be quite a bit interesting the way it can work.

I will correct you, you are wrong.  If everyone just decided to accept bitcoin, instead of dollars, then we would have no need for dollars (other than to pay taxes of course).

Yes, I'm saying that. Bitcoin is a thought crime. Believe a digital token has no value, no problem. Believe it has a tiny bit of value. No problem. Believe (and the key word here is 'belief') it has more value, then they can start throwing people in jail for believing that.
This is not about bitcoin, it is about whether or not the public is allowed to *believe* a non government backed token has value or not.

On a cell phone you can use the Android Mycellium wallet app.  Probably the easiest way to do it is to just create a wallet over at the blockchain.info website.
A number of other bitcoin wallets support BIP38 encoding.
Another way to do it, is simply go to 
Click on 'Wallet Details' and paste the private key there, it will ask you for the password and if it is correct it will decode it.

@_date: 2014-04-24 21:04:43
Here are the things I see which are good about this development.
* This solves the problem of being unable to spend  bitcoin in most places.  That part of the chicken/egg problem is solved.
* Yes, there is a fee, but that fee is for the merchant and this is a fee that they are already willing to accept for transactions to begin with.  It's certainly not a new fee for them.  Moreover, as some merchants become more comfortable with bitcoin, they may choose to save money by integrating with BitPay or Coinbase to still get fiat instantly but at even lower transaction costs.
* This finally fixes most of the security issues surrounding using a debit/credit card in that it is incredibly easy to load the card, on the fly, with only the amount of bitcoin you need for a specific transaction.  The bulk of your bitcoins can continue to be maintained independently and securely under your own control.  You will never have to use your bank debit card again to make a purchase if you choose to store all of your spending money as bitcoin instead!
* This will allow the bitcoin economy to grow as more people will be willing to accept it in payment knowing that it can immediately be used virtually anywhere.
* This does not necessarily have any real impact on volatility but that is a personal choice.  If people want to keep using dollars, well more power to them, they can still do so.  However, for those people who want to help the bitcoin economy grow and participate in it, then this is a great step towards making that happen.
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:59:16

All these things are correct.  Fortunately mining is a self-adjusting system.  Some adjustments will be in order to accommodate the reality of taxes.  We are liable to see all US based mining pools have to start filing 1099 forms with the IRS before too long.
The point is, many people are going to abandon mining because of this or run the risk of being audited and getting in trouble with the IRS.
Mining will probably move overseas to locations that are not subject to this rule.

I have noticed some bitcoin trolls using this post as 'evidence' that early bitcoin founders are 'exiting'.
Let me correct this false narrative right now.
Approximately 30% of all early bitcoins are dormant worth, in total, billions of dollars. Yes, that's billions with a 'b'.
If some early bitcoin founders are cashing out a statistically insignificant amount of bitcoins, on the order of millions with an 'm', you shouldn't overstate your case.
I only brought it up here because I have suggested previously that the earliest bitcoin keys were likely lost forever and that, apparently, now seems to not be the case.

A few follow up points.
Later today I am going to regenerate the dataset with the following changes.
* I am going to change the date format to year-month-day because it makes it easier to sort
* I am going to add a second date field which is the date of last previous use. This will make it much easier to find movement in the earliest blocks since the current 'age' column is relative.
* I am going to change the zombie score equation from days*bitcoins to days squared times bitcoin. This will make the sorted values be heavily weighted by age.
It is important to note that the value movement I have highlighted here is relatively small. What is mostly significant is that fact that the transactions come from very early blocks presumed previously to be entirely in hibernation.

Does anyone know, if you post an auction on Ebay are you allowed to state that you will accept payment in bitcoin or do they ban such posting?

Yeah, I'm a mod.  But I don't think I can ban people.  I can just remove spam posts and stuff.  And, just because I'm a mod doesn't mean I can't voice my concerns about bitcoin.  Too often this sub-reddit is an echo chamber where no criticism is allowed (via massive downvote brigades).
Bitcoin isn't perfect and if you want to see it succeed, and I do, then we need to address some of these issues broadly.
I'm very disappointed with how this block-size debate has unfolded.  It makes me very concerned as to whether or not bitcoin is capable serving as a world-wide value transfer network or not.

Why would it require a hard fork?  It would require a bump of the transaction number is all.

Largely agreed but I still fail to understand why any reasonable person didn't realize they were going to have to pay taxes in the US on bitcoin profits when using it as an investment.
I think the rule on miners having to pay taxes *at the time the bitcoins are mined* is a little absurd, hopefully that will be corrected.
I think there should be clarifications for using bitcoin as a currency versus as an investment (probably some kind of threshold, so tracking gains/losses on a cup of coffee is exempted).
As many have noted, complying with the stated IRS rules is essentially impossible for anyone who is not simply a long term buy and hold investor.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:59:16
Yes, when you cash out you pay taxes on any gains you made or you can report a loss.  Unfortunately you can only realize a maximum $3,000 capital gains loss.  This is how it works for stocks and, as I understand the IRS ruling, they are saying the same rules apply to mined bitcoins.

I'm just saying that opcodes which enable new smart contract features are generally useful to everyone.  Saying it's 'just for LN' isn't entirely accurate.

Marketplaces like this work based on 'reputation', the reputation of the buyer and the seller and the escrow agent.  You can likewise have a reputation as a moderator of the marketplace.  It there is no way to control spam, if there is no way to keep the market from being flooded with garbage or incorrectly tagged items, it's gonna be a mess.
I think this can easily be solved by community elected moderators.  Members of the marketplace can vote on moderators and, likewise, they can vote to remove moderators who they think are abusive.  It seems pretty doable.

The 'nonce' value is used by miners, and it can be ignored if you are simply parsing the blockchain for transactions.  The scope of my article was not to discuss issues related to mining or transaction validation.
My guess as to what is going on is that the 'nonce' is just a random number which is used to generate an SHA256 hash which miners must then solve for.  The 'nonce' itself is a fairly arbitrary random number and it doesn't matter whether it overflows, underflows, or outerflows.  It's just a 32 bit seed is all.

If there is no charge for using it with merchants that sounds good to me. This is a bridge that solves the chicken and egg problem until merchants realize they would be better off accepting bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2014-04-24 20:54:25
Agreed.  I see it working like this.  I only transfer enough bitcoins to my bitcoin/debit card wallet shortly before I know I'm going to make a purchase.  This offers a lot more protection than I have today.  It allows me to 'be my own bank' for almost everything except a relatively short transaction period window for a specific purchase.
Right now if someone gets my credit and/or debit card they can run up a whole lot of charges very fast. 
This solves a lot of the chicken-and-egg problem in my view.  Gone is the problem that you can't spend your bitcoin anywhere and, in time, more merchants may start accepting bitcoin directly.
It also allows me to avoid using banks as much as humanly possible, which is one of my primary goals with bitcoin.

There is a whole bunch of technical talk in this article which is mostly over my head.
However, in the conclusion, the author states that ETFs don't offer any advantage over existing exchanges.
Well there is one advantage that has me waiting for an ETF. I already invest in bitcoins by purchasing them directly on an exchange.  However I have 100's of thousands of dollars wrapped up in a 401k and I can't invest one penny of it into bitcoin futures. I would love to shift a portion of my portfolio into a bitcoin fund.
Likewise people who invest don't want to necessarily use exchanges due to the technical complexity and admittedly justified security fears.
Something they can buy through their existing traditional investment accounts holds a lot of appeal for many; including me and I know how to buy bitcoin directly.

Thanks Ken for replying.
One thing I wanted to clarify.  I thought the way that malleability worked in relation to MtGox was that the modified transaction was accepted into the blockchain (with a different transaction id than the original send) which is what allowed a user to spoof their accounting software into getting a double-payout?
This pair of transactions seems to show that:
See this set of transactions on the blockchain.info website:
See how the address received two payments of the same amount within a relatively short period of time.  
At any rate, I'm starting at the basics which is to look for all unique patterns in how the input-scripts are represented for every transaction in the blockchain, trying to create a kind of 'fingerprint' of all of the different permutations.
I think my first step is going to be to report some basic statistics about how many transactions use which forms of the input-script over time.

Watching the US just blatantly use the banking system as a weapon of war is really pretty disturbing.  They treat the banks as their personal servants, whether it's to attack Russia or a stripper's cash receipts.  I realize maybe I live in a bit of a bubble hanging around the bitcoin subreddit, but this frequent use of the banks as an arm of the government to wage war on people and nations is really starting to be a very disturbing trend.
As we all know, bitcoin completely circumvents all of this.  Hurrah for bitcon right?
But, it makes you wonder, are they really going to allow significant capital to flow through bitcoin in a way that they cannot confiscate or otherwise directly control?  For how long?
I imagine we are just a few months away from a terrorist attack where they will 'blame' bitcoin as having financed it.  I expect false-flag like attacks or otherwise demonization of the protocol within six months or less.

Your IP address is only exposed when you send a transaction. Also, your IP address is not recorded in the blockchain; however that does not preclude anyone from monitoring the network and recording them themselves.

@_date: 2014-07-22 20:04:21
True, but if bitcoin becomes a major world-wide backbone for the transmission and storage of value it will do so based entirely on faith in the network.  If the network went down, or there was a bug which corrupted the blockchain, it might be a blow so severe it could bring the entire thing crashing down.  
My analogy is this.  I used to work on medical diagnostic software.  Today I work in computer games.  If I have a bug in my game software, worst case scenario is someone loses their current progress in a game.  That's a sucky experience but no real harm done.  When I was working on medical software, a bug could lead to an incorrect diagnosis which could lead to a patients death and that would just be awful.
With bitcoin, a single unexpected bug with the release of an update could accidentally destroy billions of dollars of value.  
Large complex software systems end up having emergent behavior, it's the infamous 'butterfly' effect.  You can change one line of code that appears completely harmless, or you could have a simple typo, and it can manifest itself in other totally unrelated systems.  You can even have sleeper bugs where a bug is created, but it does no harm whatsoever and ends up in the code for years.  Then, later, you make a minor change which appears harmless but that minor change causes the sleeping bug (in code you assumed was rock-solid) to now manifest itself and all hell breaks loose.  You look and look at your most recent code change and can't find anything wrong with it, but it's because the problem only showed up due to intended consequences of how that interacted with older legacy code long since assumed to be solid and stable.
These kinds of things have happened to me when working on millions of line code bases, which is why I consider it a legitimate non-zero risk that a bug in the software could do devastating damage to the entire value network.

Ok, here is the link.  You do not have to build the source code, a windows 64 bit console application is checked in.
If you don't know how to sync an SVN repository, you can install Tortoise SVN which is pretty easy to use.
So, here is how you get the answers you want using my tool.  You will need a Windows 64 bit machine with a *lot* of ram and free disk space (probably &gt;=8gb of RAM).
(1) You must have the entire blockchain synced on your local hard drive.  You get this by running the official bitcoin-qt client.  If you haven't changed the data directory then it will be located on your machine at c:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\blocks
(2) To run my tool you go to a command prompt and run 'blockchain64.exe' and pass in as the command line the directory name where the blk?????.dat files are located on your machine.
(3) Decide how many blocks you want to process.  If you want to process them all, then don't do anything but, let's say you only want to process up to block 150000, then you can type 'max_blocks 150000' and hit enter.
(4) Next type 'scan' which will scan the blockchain headers up to the 'max_blocks' provided or until the last block is found.
(5) Since you want to produce detailed statistics on individual addresses you will next need to tell the tool that you want to process all transactions.  You do this by typing 'statistics' and hitting enter.
(6) Now type 'process' and hit enter.  This will actually process every block and analyze all transactions and addresses.  Depending on the speed of your computer and hard drive, this could take like 15 minutes to run.  You will get feedback as it is processing the blockchain data.  This will consume an enormous amount of memory on your computer and if you don't have enough memory and free disk space it could hang your machine.
(7) When this finishes you can now start running queries against the database.  To find out the top 1,000 addresses by balance, for example, you can type 'top_balance 1000'.  To report all of the transactions details of a specific public key address you can type 'adr &lt;key&gt;' and hit enter.  To find the addresses which are the oldest (above a certain minimum balance) you can type "oldest &lt;n&gt;" and hit enter.  To change the minimum balance threshold you can type 'min_balance &lt;n&gt;'  The tool also outputs some data during the process phase to a file called 'stats.csv'; this is a comma separated file you can load into Excel.  You can gather statistics by year, by month, by week, or by day.
You can find 'zombie' addresses by typing 'zombie &lt;days&gt;' where &lt;days&gt; is how many days old before an address is considered a 'zombie' (has had not output transactions performed on it since that time.)
This tool is largely presented as an educational resource and if you are a programmer you are encouraged to modify the code to produce additional data you might find interesting or output it in a different format.
@_date: 2014-01-05 14:28:41

@_date: 2014-11-22 17:00:53
Ok, I admit this one might be a little difficult to interpret, but let me try to explain.
People often talk about those giant public key addresses, the ones which hold say over 100,000 bitcoins.  Then there are guys who have say 50 bitcoins and they put them in one address.  And, finally, there are guys like me who own over a hundred bitcoins but store each one in a separate public key.
It is easy to read too much into quantity of value stored in particular public keys but it is still kind of interesting to know what that distribution looks like.
In this graph the X axis is time, with one entry per day.
The Y axis is a breakdown of the total percentage of bitcoins stored in public keys of a particular size.
You will note that for the first two years of bitcoin almost all of the value is in that big orange block which represents public key addresses with more than 50 bitcoins but fewer than 100.
Obviously these represent all of the early 50btc miners rewards over the years.
The top of the graph represents the big money bitcoin public key addresses; those with over 100k bitcoins in them.
The idea here is to just get a sense of how bitcoins are distributed based on public key addresses; how many are in big accounts, medium accounts, etc.  I realize this graph is a little difficult to read, but I figured people would still like to see it.
I can make the raw data available if anyone wants to try to graph if differently.
Here is a link to the same data but focusing on only the period of the past two years which is a lot more interesting to look at and easier to interpret.

@_date: 2015-12-28 20:34:52
I'm a fan of SW almost 100% because if finally fixes the transaction malleability bug, and for no other reason.  I think we should get it in as soon as we can, safely, for this reason alone.
Claiming it is a scaling solution is just a very silly game of semantics.  It is a block-size increase for all practical purposes since it increase the disk space requirements the same as one.
@_date: 2014-01-18 20:38:41
I don't find the distribution of addresses all that interesting, but I have made charts which show that sort of thing.
Here's a blog post I made showing a breakdown of address distribution, including all of the dust, over time and by balance.  People found this 3d surface graph a bit confusing.   As I said, I'm working on an interactive 3d app that let's you view the entire blockchain over time and in real-time.
@_date: 2014-01-19 06:16:12
Yeah, because everyone's biggest complaint about bitcoin is that its not volatile enough.
The bottom line is that extended periods of relative stability at prices near $900 per btc is obviously a good thing.

I agree but when you think about retirement, and you are a young person, the whole thing is high risk.  Right now they are predicting massive world-wide unrest, economic collapse, and global devastation due to climate change.  If you are in your 20's the entire idea of betting on a 'retirement' in your late 60's is pretty high risk to begin with.

Just for fun, I added a bonus round question.  If I do one of these trivia contests again, I will set the entire thing up this way.  The public key, the private key, and the clue are all contained directly on the blockchain.info website!
* Bonus Question: 
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:22:03
* Privacy : I can buy things online without revealing any personal information about myself.  That's freaking huge.
* Investment : It's money I can use as both a currency and an investment at the same time.  Some may point out that it's a volatile and risky investment, and that's just fine, but it's also a choice.  My choice. And I like freedom of choice.  Try taking your investment gold into Walmart, or to make a purchase online with it.  It's really a unique situation to have something that functions both as a commodity investment and a highly efficient payment system simultaneously.
* I control my own money.  I have zero risk of confiscation by the government.  I don't have nosy bankers asking my 'why' I want to withdraw my own money from a checking account.  This is insanely important to me.
* I do not trust the current fiat currency system.  It is being inflated and is debt based, almost certain to collapse at some point in the future.  I would rather invest in a new economy based on bitcoin than further support their soon to be worthless paper money.
Reason enough?
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:51:00
Yes. Scientologists, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and evangelicals often do that. I mostly ignore them because I don't need the negative karma on my soul.
Back to your original point, the question of accepting bitcoin at your business, first, there is a perfectly rational reason not to do so. It is a pain in the ass, the accounting burden more so, and it will hardly account for any business. Perfectly reasonable.
What isn't reasonable is to reject it because it 'isn't money' because, to the business owner, they never see bitcoins if they don't want to, they just get fiat at a low fee, in other words it is just another payment network.
For many businesses it is probably more trouble than it is worth, like accepting Discover, Diners Club, or American Express.

It has weathered many attacks in the past and will weather just as many in the future.  It's not called 'The Honey Badger of Money' for no reason.
But, seriously, it's going belly up.  Sell me your coins for $100 apiece, I'll take them off your hands....

This question get's asked again and again.  All of the bitcoins are not available for sale.  Of those which are, such an attempt would drive the price through the roof making every BTC holder wealthy.  Then, once Gates finishes his buying spree, the price would crash.

That sounds good to me, let's see them try.

Here is why.
* A 2mb bump in blocksize is a **trivial** and a relatively (relative to SegWit) low-risk change which shouldn't be controversial.  The fact that fake controversy about it is being generated is a sign that there is a hidden agenda involved.  All scaling scenarios for bitcoin require massive increases in the blocksize; not to support more payment transactions, but simply to support more users.  Since all parties, with the rare exception of some truly out there people, agree that the blocksize is going to need to be increased, then their refusal to do it now through stalling tactics reveal a hidden agenda.  They don't want to increase the blocksize **until** a substantial fee market has developed.  If it was merely a matter of a free-market fee system developing, that would be one thing, but a fee-market comes with some horrible side effects; which include destroying bitcoin as a payment network **before** any alternative off-chain solution exists.
* SegWit is not ready.  
* SegWit has not yet been tested.
* SegWit will break numerous applications; from wallets to websites to block explorers, etc.  A bump to 2mb has none of these problems and is very low risk.
* SegWit is a very complex code change, more so because they are trying to do it as a 'soft-fork' which means that it will silently break all kinds of software.  As any software engineer knows, complexity presents risk.  Large scale software projects often demonstrate a 'butterfly effect' where one tiny change in code can have unpredictable ripple effects that affect seemingly unrelated systems.  To be safe, changes require extensive testing to make sure problems don't show up and, often times, still don't show up until they are out in the wild.  Getting SegWit implemented and fully tested will take a long time.  Doing it as a soft-fork; rather than the far cleaner hard-fork approach, is especially dangerous.
The point is that a 2mb **shouldn't** be contentious.  It is the most simple and lowest risk change we could make to the code.  The fact that some people, who freely admit that the blocksize is going to have to grow anyway (to support a larger number of users), but refuse to do it now (since they haven't achieved their desired goal of a heavily constrained fee market), is probably the bigger issue.

Miners and people using bitcoin to buy things causes a steady-state sell pressure.  Buys are more sporadic.  The recent run-up in price was due to some whales buying in.  The whales left for the moment so a deflating of the price is natural.
Contrary to popular belief, bitcoin is not currently a deflationary currency.  The supply is inflating daily due to mining activity.  This will taper off in the future but, for now, it does cause a ever present sell pressure over time.

Two things. First, long steady stable price of bitcoin at $450 sounds fucking awesome. Reduced volatility and a high valuation that's all good to me. Extreme volatility with frequent crashes is far more concerning.
Second, the price is not moving because exchange volume is low. Exchange volume is low because the exchanges suck and everyone is, reasonably, being cautious.
When new major trusted exchanges come online it will be a total reset for the price discovery game.

My point being that even though the coins are being sold off-market, the price they get will be tightly bound to market price and you can manipulate the market price quite a bit if you are a happy whale and know what you are doing.

This has been reported by others in the past.  The bottom line is that you can't use a savings account like a checking account.  Savings accounts are intentionally designed for people who want to keep a lot of money in, well, 'savings'.  
If you want to do lots of funds transfers you are supposed to use a checking account.  It's an easy enough mistake to make and easy enough to correct.
Personally, I closed my savings account because I have no interest in keeping 'extra money' in fiat.  If I have any extra money it's either going to go into bitcoin, gold, or some other form of investment.

You start with this.  How much money do you have?  You might say, I have $2,000.  Really, check your wallet? Well, actually, you only have $5 in your wallet, the rest of your money is just numbers in a computer at the bank. 
In fact, the vast majority of everyone's 'money' is just numbers on bank computers, and when we make payments, via credit card or debit card, no actual physical money changes hands.  One computer is just sending a message to another computer.
Bitcoin is essentially no different.  It is digital money represented as numbers on a computer.  However, unlike the banks, instead of the money being stored on a banks computer, with bitcoin, the money is represented on tens of thousands of computers world wide!  
Every time you make a transaction, instead of it being recorded on one central bank computer, it is recorded on tens of thousands of computers world wide using a 'peer-to-peer' database.
You may not know what a peer-to-peer network is, but many people use them all of the time.  If you have ever used bit-torrent, then you have used a peer to peer network.
Bitcoin is similar but instead of streaming music and videos, it is recording ledger entries representing value.
You might wonder, how come people can't hack these databases?  What keeps people from just stealing bitcoins by sending bad transactions?
Without getting into the technical details the simple answer is 'math'.  This is an extremely simplified analogy, but it works nonetheless.  If you send a message from one computer to another stating that 2+2 = 4; then every other computer will verify that this is true and accept your message.  However, if you send a message saying that 2+2 = 5, then every other computer in the world will reject it because that math is wrong.
The math behind bitcoin is vastly, vastly, more complex than this, but you don't need to know those details unless you are getting a degree in computer science and cryptography.  Suffice it to say, the peer-to-peer distributed bitcoin database (ledger) is confirmed and validated by irrefutable math.  No one can 'hack' the system, because you can't hack math.
Technically the only way someone could cheat the system is if they controlled more than 51% of the computer power running the network, and even then, the cheats they could apply would be very limited.  This 51% attack is considered generally impossible and impractical.
Finally, the digital values you transmit on the bitcoin network act as a form of currency; just like US dollars, Euros, etc.  And just as these currencies change in value against each other on a day to day basis, so does the value of bitcoins change against other currencies.
You can choose to use bitcoins in two ways.  First, you can treat it as an investment because, unlike all other world currencies, bitcoin is limited in quantity (again by mathematics) to a fixed number of them.  Over time, so long as bitcoin continues to be around, bitcoins should on average increase in value.  They may have significant volatility because, currently, the market is extremely small, but on a long term trend they should go up in value.
However, that isn't what is interesting to this audience.  The far better and practical use for bitcoin is online commerce.  Bitcoins are the perfect form of money for the Internet.  You can send money to and from any person in the world nearly instantaneously, nearly for free, as simple as sending a text message or email.  It is also highly secure, unlike credit cards which are severely broken.
So, my recommendation is to purchase small amounts of bitcoin, store them on your cell phone, and use them for online purchases.  At least that's what I do.

I think that is true, but then let us be clear that they aren't regulating a technology, they are regulating thought and speech.
People in general are hypnotized by the mythology of money. They think it is magical and special and only the state can bless it.
This is proven by the fact that 99.9999% of businesses will not even accept bitcoin as having value.
But we know that is not true. We can choose any monetary unit we wish. 
So, there are some things that 99.99999% of the world hasn't figured out yet. This is about freedom pure and simple.

It means that in the last year some people who mined bitcoins when they were essentially worthless and left them untouched for years decided to spend or otherwise move them. There are millions of bitcoins which were mined in the first few years of bitcoin which have never been touched. Tracking how many of them move years later is kind of interesting.
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:30:07
Yeah, I just updated the spreadsheet with the results if you had only been dollar averaging since January 1, 2014.
The results are:
$10,600 invested.  16.89 bitcoins purchased at an average price of $627 apiece for a loss of $1,982 or a 18% drop in value.
This is calculated against today's price of $510.
However, if you had made one single $10,600 investment when bitcoins cost $1,000 apiece you would have a dramatically different result.
I would rather have 16.89 bitcoins and be showing an 18.7% loss than only have 10.6 bitcoins and be showing a nearly 50% loss.
That's the lesson here.

I think the real issue, the big issue, is what are they going to do about people who are running around buying cars, houses, and other expensive luxury items who think they don't have to pay taxes when they do that.
Are they going to start making retailers report when people buy big ticket items with bitcoin?
And, don't even get me started on alt-coins. I have a nice little spreadsheet showing every time I have bought bitcoins for USD and every time I have sold bitcoins for USD with the intention of being a good little boy and reporting that all on my taxes.
However, as soon as I started buying things with bitcoins, handing them out as gifts, and played around with alt-coins, I can't even begin to hope to keep track of all of that in a way that would satisfy the IRS.

Ok, it's been long enough so I will now report the answers to the clues.  This was just a first experimental game for me to figure out how this might work.  I have just come up with an ideal for a much more complicated and interesting game that should, in theory, take people a long time to play and have lasting power; meaning the game could continue to be played by people (so long as there are no spoilers posted) for a long time.
The first clue was 'Grok' and the answer was 'Heinlein' which is, of course, a reference to the frequent use of this term (meaning to deeply understand something) in the book 'Stranger in a Strange Land' by Robert A. Heinlein.
The answer in the blockchain is here:
Here you will see that the next clue is "Mule".  The answer to this clue was "Asimov" since 'The Mule' was a major character in Isaac Asimov's famous 'Foundation' series.
The brain wallet clue then becomes: 'Heinlein+Asimov' taking you here in the blockchain:
The next clue at that location was 'Corey'.  This was an intentionally very difficult question, the one that stumped most people.  I did eventually give out some additional hints but the person who got the answer first did so without any additional hints.
One of my favorite fantasy series of all time is 'The Amber' series by Roger Zelazny.  In most of the books in this series the main character is Prince Corwin.  However, his name on our earth was 'Carl Corey'.  
Since the answer was Zelazny this led to the following brain wallet passprhase:
Which can be found here on the blockchain:
The clue found here was 'Teg'.  Since 'Teg' is a pretty unique name I don't know how difficult this one really was going to be for people to figure out.  One of my favorite science fiction series of all time is 'Dune' by Frank Herbert.  I hoped to make this one a little bit tricky since even though 'Miles Teg' is a major character in the Dune series, he doesn't show up until the later books which not everyone has read.
This leads us to the following brain wallet passphrase:
Which is here in the blockchain: 
The clue we find here is 'Fireman'.  This might have been considered difficult if you didn't know what the genre was but, since the genre is science fiction and 'Fahrenheit 451' by Ray Bradbury is one of the most famous science fiction books of all time, I didn't think this one was too difficult.  In the book, the main character 'Guy Montag' has the job title of 'fireman' who is hired to burn books.
One my key goals with these clues was to make sure that you couldn't simply do a Google search and get the answer.  For example, 'Teg' is a pretty unique name but if you do a Google search on it it turns out to be an acronym for a ton of companies unrelated to any science fiction series.
With this final answer we have completed the puzzle to form this brain wallet phrase:
This leads us to the following location on the blockchain:
Here you can see a note of congratulations to the winner and a larger cash prize of 30 millibits which was taken by reddit user It's going to take me a while to put the next one of these together since it is going to be much, much, more complicated. I actually have to write a piece of software to create the game.  The questions will be a lot easier but finding the winning prize will be much more difficult.  I don't want to say too much more about it because the game design is part of the puzzle.
Thanks to all of those who played!

It's neither good news nor bad news.  It's just data.

So, I am now re-running my stats which break down the entire blockchain on a daily basis.  Since I switched to memory mapped file access (and I don't have an SD-DRIVE in my machine) I expect this to take a long time to run (possibly all day).  When it's finished I will make a post with any interesting data.
Also, I added an option to generate a report showing all ASCII data embedded in the blockchain.  Most if it is just little ASCII messages in the coinbase blocks inserted by the miner but, occasionally, there is some other interesting stuff in there too.  I will make that data set available as well.

I just re-ran my stats and thought I would share.  There continues to be a pattern of just a couple hundred very, very, early mined bitcoins being moved every few months or so.  This time, on October 14, September 22, and September 29, 2014 some bitcoins which were originally mined less than a few weeks after bitcoin was created in 2009 were moved.  
There is nothing really to conclude about this, it is simply interesting to know that someone who mined bitcoins over the first couple of weeks still controls those keys after all of these years and has managed to not touch them for almost five years time; not even to move them to a more secure wallet.  Kind of amazing to me.
@_date: 2014-07-12 15:55:03
That would be awesome. I still see plenty of long term risk for bitcoin but when the ETF launches I think the short term risk will be very low and quite likely a price doubling. Doubling up my 401k would be nice.

Wow, so stability is bad? Stability means it can be widely used in commerce and for remittance worldwide. Today the only people who even have any bitcoin to spend are early adopters and people willing to accept massive risk to hold it for any length of time. Stability breeds confidence for the average consumer so that they can safely use it as a store of value. If it is not only relatively stable but also slightly appreciates on average it could replace savings accounts everywhere.
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:53:20
My best hope is further proliferation of two-way ATMs to make worldwide remittance become a reality.
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:12:32
Ok, well as I said it might be a dumb suggestion.  Let me rephrase it as a question then, how can we modify the protocol so that transactions are immutable?  Obviously everything else in the transaction is immutable (otherwise bitcoin wouldn't work) so why can't the transaction hash somehow be folded into that?

However, unlike traditional fiat currency, they can't simply print more.  And, if all they do is hold the bitcoin and never spend it, what is the point?  Once they do spend it, on goods and services of values, then the currency gets redistributed throughout the economy. 
See how free markets work when you don't have a federal reserve pumping 70 billion dollars a month into it to prop up wealthy bankers?
That money by early holders and thieves will, once spent, end up in the hands of market makers providing goods and services of value.
I look forward to the day when they begin to spend their wealth.

Here's an amusing transaction for you.  Not everyone is moving large sums of ancient money around, some people are moving pocket change.
Check this one out.
On June 26, 2011 someone sent one millibit to this address.  At that time one millibit was essentially worthless.  Actually, it's still not worth much today either.
Then, on July 23, 2014, just a few days ago, they went to all of the trouble to spend that 1 millibit three years later!
You gotta love it.

Part of me wants to do the same because I believe the hype cycle practically guarantees a profit. However, I'm thinking that on principle alone I will probably just refuse to get involved.
I'm still open minded, but I want to see specific detailed use cases that call for a Turing complete language to solve a problem that adds value. And, by that, I mean the actual code. I want to know why looping, and recursion, provide value.  Instead I just hear a bunch of nonsense, techno babble, and the same old alt-coin metrics.
There doesn't appear to be anything here that colored coins couldn't solve just as well.

Well even if you assume all 4 million outstanding zombie bitcoins belong to Satoshi that's only about 4 billion dollars; a lot of money but a lot less than Bill Gates. I take your point that if bitcoin grows by orders of magnitude then wealth disparity is a worthwhile discission.

Bitcoin failure to me is that it is outlawed by the state, no legitimate business will touch it, and the only value it derives is from the black market.

Why? These are cheap coins if you believe in the long term prospects of bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a binary bet due to the inherent mathematics of the system.
In five years bitcoin will either be worth much more then it is today or virtually zero. There isn't room for much middle ground. This is, quite literally, basic math.
I won't bother to list the litany of risks. There are many. Bitcoin is a very risky investment. But if you are betting on bitcoin at all you better be betting on a several year time scale.
It's still risky and it's still binary but it hasn't hit zero yet which means the experiment is still playing out.
Bitcoin is based on hard math. If it succeeds it is guaranteed to be worth a great deal more. If it fails it is guaranteed to be worthless.
If you are making that binary bet and you are committed to it then, indeed, these are cheap coins.
Wake me up in two years and either (A) $500 bitcoins are a bargain and I'm wishing I had bought more than I did or (B) bitcoins are worthless and I wish I hadn't thrown good money after bad.
To me they seem cheap.

Apparently the malleability problem involved a portion of a script being modified. My question is this, how come when the sender signed the transaction the complete contents of this script were not part of the signature too? This seems to be a security risk if the script code can be modified but the signature still be considered valid?
Why can't the devs revise the signature code to take all portions of the transaction data into account so this won't happen again?

Yeah, simple as this.  As much as humanly possible use bitcoin for all of your online transactions.  As more and more vendors begin to accept it that becomes more and more possible every day.  
This is about your personal privacy really.  Buying things online without giving out your credit card number and without giving Visa, Mastercard, or PayPal a cut feels really good.
This is how you can do this in a practical way.  Set up an account on coinbase which you can link to your checking account.  The setup is pretty much identical to setting up a PayPal account.  Buy relatively small amounts of bitcoin that way so that you can then use it for your various online purchases and donations to charity.  Send some of it to your cell phone wallet and try to use it in the 'real world' when and where you can.
The only downside is that you will be subject to some small amount of volatility, but if you aren't dealing with large sums of money I, for one, think it's worth being exposed to a little volatility in exchange for supporting the network.

The argument isn't spurious because that is, quite literally, what it is. It is a public ledger (database) representing tokens.
Nothing more and nothing less. The fact that some humans assign 'value' to these ledger entries is completely arbitrary. Proven by the fact that it took many years for anyone to treat them as having any value at all.
Even today 99.9999999% of all merchants in the world refuse to accept that bitcoins represent any value at whatsoever.

That's funny because the  reason I spend bitcoin is so that I don't have to give out my credit card number to anyone.  I'm on about my 4th credit card in the past few years. It was skimmed twice at physical locations (bar / restaurant), fraudulent charges after an online transaction, and reissued after the Target fiasco.
Now with Tiger Direct and Overstock I can buy almost anything I might want online with bitcoin, and I do.
I also absolutely REFUSE to make any online donation to any organization unless they accept bitcoin; and those that do I am very generous to and support.

Some people, like yourself, seem to be intentionally trying to misunderstand what I'm saying.  So, let me state it again, in a simple and clear way.
* The vast majority of all bitcoin addresses contain almost no value.
* Many addresses hold funds which have been irrevocably lost forever, and we don't know how many they are nor do we have a way of knowing for sure.  It's probably a very large number.
* Many of the top addresses represent businesses and some of those businesses are exchanges which means that the funds actually represent the holdings of an indeterminate number of individuals. 
* Many addresses belong to a single person but we cannot know which.
Because of these variables, there is no way to create a statistic based on 'income distribution' when the underlying assumption defies these facts.  There may well be income inequality, however, we can never know given these fundamental limitations in our knowledge about how addresses may or may not map to individual people.
Clear enough?
I was not saying there isn't wealth inequality, there probably is, what I was saying is that you can't say with certainty statistics based on false assumptions.  Suppose 30% of all bitcoins are irrevocably lost and many of the top bitcoin addresses actually correspond to exchanges.  If you quote statistics about inequality without taking these two variables into account (which you cannot know with any certainty to begin with) then clearly your statistics are bogus.
Unless you suddenly found a way to make all bitcoin addresses non-anonymous and somehow found a way to distinguish hibernating from lost coins and businesses from their customers funds, well, you cannot say with any specificity such statistics.
Get it??

There is a chance that your wallet addresses can be inferred if you ever submit a transaction which pulls outputs from different addresses.
If this occurs then it's probably safe to assume that the person who submitted that transaction controls all of the input addresses and, therefore, a wallet association can be inferred.  This kind of thing can happen rather frequently when using wallet software as it scans all of your addresses for available funds and will pull from multiple addresses if necessary when submitting a new transaction.
However, as far as I know, this is the only way you can make such an inference simply by scanning the blockchain.
There are many, many, examples in the blockchain where multiple addresses are used for inputs.

Ok, to me this is the most interesting chart I have produced by running my tool against the blockchain.
Here's what this chart shows, and it's current as of today.
Addresses controlling about 2% of the total value of bitcoin were accessed in the past day, another 4% in the past week, another 13% in the last month and so on.
This chart shows that over 65% of all bitcoins in existence are associated with addresses that have had some activity within the past year.  The remaining 35% shows the breakdown by age. 
This should give you a very clear visual idea of the total holdings residing in relatively old addresses which have remained untouched for a long time.

I find this an interesting assertion, as cults are one of my favorite subjects. I study them intensively.
One key feature of cults is that they cultivate an irrational belief in a particular ideology.
In contrast, the blockchain is based on irrefutable concrete mathematics and perfect logic.
Many of the supporters of bitcoin, like myself, are professional software engineers who understand both the mathematics and software underpinning blockchain technology in incredible detail.
We recognize that this is a true breakthrough technology which is as game changing as the invention of the internet itself.
All of this forms the basis of a concrete belief system in an innovative technology, this belief is anything but 'cult' like.
Perhaps you just don't understand what is really going on here.

There is a one word clue for each and the clue will usually be either the first or last name of a major character in one of this author's famous books.  Your answer will be the author's last name only, capitalized.  So, for example, if the clue was "Monolith" your answer would be "Clarke" for Arthur C. Clark since, of course, the clue is a reference to the infamous monolith in 2001 A Space Odyssey.  
Now you take the current clue sequence and paste it into the Passphrase section of brainwallet.org to find the public and private key.  If your answer is correct, use the private key to sweep the funds.  At that public key location on blockchain.info you will see in the public note section the clue to the next answer in the chain.  Remember that each time you add on, you must include all of the previous answers in sequence.  So if, for example, the second clue was "Frodo" then the answer would, obviously, be "Tolkien".  To find the next clue you would have to enter "Clarke+Tolkien" into the Passphrase to find the public and private key.  Just entering 'Tolkien" would be incorrect.
Once you have been able to string all five answers together successfully you will get the grand prize of 30mbtc and bragging rights as the winner.
I would like to say that this particular scavenger hunt is not a very difficult challenge.  Most of the clues lead to very obvious answers of the science fiction or fantasy author if you are at all familiar with the genre.  At least one of them will probably be considered difficult.
So, let's get started.  Your first clue is: "Grok"

Yes, this is true. There is a lot of magical thinking about money.  People believe in money for the same reason they believe in Jesus Christ, because it was drummed into them forcefully since an early age.
Robert Heinlein used to talk about this a lot in his science fiction books.  In one book as he was ranting on about this topic his main character started burning money to the horror of the person the lecture was directed towards; he did this to make the point that it is just paper.
Somebody needs to explain why a sheet of paper with the number 100 printed on it in ink is "worth more" than a sheet of paper with the number one printed on it.  It's purely a shared delusion and mystical belief.
Human beings can all agree, rather arbitrarily, what they will believe to be money and, poof, so it is.
Bitcoin, and dogecoin, and all of the others help bust the mythic nature of money.  It exposes the con that people have been under for a very long time.
It's like a long time religious person finally realizing there is no God.  At first they are a bit angry but soon they realize how liberating it is.
Here is a bit more on the specific Heinlein quote I was referencing:
For example, in Time Enough for Love, Heinlein's character Lazarus Long is seen burning money at the bank he is running on a small planet. A friend is aghast that someone could be so foolish as to burn something as valuable as money. Long explains that whenever his bank has to issue money, he just prints more. Rather than leave money laying about (and tempting robbers) he just burns the "deposits" until someone asks to withdraw money - at which point he prints more.
And it is a story-within-the-story that really tells a significant truth. The underlying value of money is not in the paper and ink, but in the idea of its worth. And like the disbelieving character in the story, most people simply don't get it. After all, money is valuable, right? You can't simply burn it. (And the story pretty much mirrors what our government does on a daily basis - shredded old obsolete bills and printing millions more to replace them).
The Gold Bugs should read that story - and understand that the value of gold is really just an idea that can (and will) change over time. Gold is no "safe haven" for investors, as history has shown. Once the idea about its value increases, the supply will as well - leading to a decrease in the idea of its value.

Oh, I think a lot of people are jumping through hoops trying to track 'stolen' coins and coming to a lot of wrong conclusions.  Anyone can tag an address with a label and I think a lot of these are false.  I'm  not sure you can ascribe a lot of meaning to it with any degree of certainty.

Thanks to everyone who played the BIP38 Trivia Contest.  It was a lot of fun and you guys did a great job on some really difficult questions.  It's been a couple of days and still nobody got the answer to  so I closed it out.
Here's the link to the original contest:
I did add a bonus question here if anyone wants to take a shot at it:
I ran two of these trivia contests and the community seemed to enjoy it.  It was an excellent way to learn about BIP38 encoding as well as how to sweep the contents of a private key.
I personally donated about 300mbtc for the two contests.  If somebody wants to sponsor another one, I am happy to take donations for the cause.
I work in the game industry myself and I think it's kind of fascinating that you can devise a game, with a payout, purely by using the blockchain.
The next time I do one of these all of the questions will be hosted directly on the blockchain.info page in the forum of a 'Public Note' as in the example above.
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:38:39

That's a good ideal. Since people solved this one so quickly I will do another one soon with harder questions and more information on how to test their answers. 
To be honest I considered having to figure out BIP38 as part of the challenge.
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:10:52
Not yet, but I see no reason why they would not add this feature in the future.  There was an article out today saying that Microsoft intends to ingrate bitcoin deeply.
The way this would most likely work is say you want to buy a game or rent a movie.  You select 'pay with bitcoin' and a QR code would pop up.  You point your cell phone at the TV screen and, boom, a split second later it's paid for; without compromising your personal money in any way.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:20:40
Bitcoin is digital cash for the Internet, it's as easy as sending a text message and behaves just like cash.  You can send it directly person to person.  The most common, and convenient, way to use it is on your cell phone.  You download an app called a 'bitcoin wallet' and you can use it to send and receive bitcoins.
You can buy bitcoins at  or   Both services act approximately like PayPal in that you connect it to your checking account and then can buy and sell bitcoins whenever you want.

My main reason is that I absolutely hate, hate, hate, giving out my credit card number to anyone online.  And I would *never* give out my debit card number online.  So, for me, the main reason to use it is to protect my privacy.
The current credit card and debit cards in the US are completely unprotected in any way and, even though they say you 'aren't liable for fraudulent charges', it's still a giant pain in the ass when it happens.

I have created a shared Google docs spreadsheet which shows what would have happened if you bought $100 worth of bitcoin each day of the year for one year.  This is the true definition of dollar-cost-averaging.
The post I made yesterday which got so many upvotes was not true dollar cost averaging, it was more just a record of my buys 'on the dips'.
Either way, the point is that when you want to make a long term investment in something which is highly volatile, it's probably better/safer to buy a fixed amount over a long period of time instead of just doing one big buy-in while it's on the rise.
If you bought in one time, at a high point, then, yeah, things don't look so good.  So, one strategy (and this is just one) is spread your investment out over a period of time.
And, if $100 a day is too rich for your blood, $10 a day gets the same results but lowered by a factor of 10 of course.   $10 a day would still net you 20.3 btc with a $6,712 profit.

Well, you might be right. But bitcoin lives or dies based on the consensus of the community. Right now I get a sense that the community is fed up with this current foundation and, in a decentralized system, there is plenty of room for multiple groups to voice their opinion on the future of the technology.
@_date: 2014-04-30 18:34:58
Something important for people to know about my graphs and statistics here.
Let's say you have a bitcoin address that holds 100,000 bitcoins which have not been touched in over two years.  That would place those 100k coins in the 'over two' years section of the graph.
Now, let's say you spend one single Satoshi out of that address.  Realize that this marks *all* 100,000 coins as 'alive' and 'active' and shifts them into the 'just spent today' category.  It does not shift just the one Satoshi to the current category and leave the remaining in the 'two years old' category.
This is because that single Satoshi spend demonstrates that the owner has control over the private key and is thus declaring all 100k coins as 'alive' and part of the current economy.
I realize some people might treat the data differently, but I am mostly concerned in bitcoin addresses with zero spends for a long period of time.  If you do a spend, of any amount, then you are demonstrating that you control those keys.
Imagine if Satoshi started doing even the tiniest spend from one of the earliest mined blocks.  It doesn't matter if he only spends a single Satoshi, that would still be a massively huge and important event for the community as it would demonstrate that he is in active control of those funds.

I have often been fascinated by the psychological pathology of the garden variety internet troll.
If I think something is stupid I waste almost zero energy trying to convince stupid people they are wrong.
I can appreciate a well reasoned debate on the pros and cons of a technology, or even ideology, but few internet trolls seem interested in that.
I have witnessed bitcoin trolls attack with the ferocity normally reserved for an evangelical Christian trying to convince someone they are going to hell if they keep following the path they are on.
If bitcoin is worthless, and stupid, then it is hardly your concern or business trying to attack people who think otherwise.
I often wonder why bitcoin trolls don't hang out on gambling sub-reddits, or penny stock sub-reddits, attacking those guys?
Oh yeah... I think I know why.
It's not because they give a fuck about any individual bitcoin investor, it is most likely because they have a vested interest in a competing business and technology.
If you truly give a shit that bitcoin investors are making a bad gamble why don't you hang out at casinos and race tracks trying to save those degenerate sinners?

It's interesting playing the "when I was young" game. When I was young my parents could talk about when there was no such thing as TV, and my grandparents had clear memories of growing up without electricity or cars.
My best, favorite, "when I was young" memory is when I realize that I am so old that I can remember when men used to fly to the moon. Today the United States has to hitch a ride from the Russians just to get into orbit.
I saw Apollo 11, 12, and 13 launch, personally, because I lived at Cape Canaveral and my father and uncle worked for NASA. My Uncle was one of the main computer programmers for the Apollo missions.

As many people on this subredit already know I'm very pro bitcoin but I'm also pro-honesty and there are a lot of semantic games being played here.  Call a bug a bug and, personally, I would rather this be fixed properly than a bandaid work around.
Allowing transaction which were modified by a 3rd party to be included in the blockchain while rejecting the original sender's transaction is more than just an odd quirk or, for fucks sake a desired feature.
Fix the protocol and make everyone upgrade!
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:53:02
You might be misunderstanding.  The system does *not* reject the 3rd party modified transaction, it *accepts* it as being valid, even though it is not.  The only valid transaction is the one originally signed by the sender.  In the case of a modified transaction the *original* sender's transaction gets *rejected* as a double spend.
If you think it is valid and correct behavior for a 3rd party hacker to be able to modify *your* transaction and have it accepted by the network, I'm quite surprised by that.
Just because they have not figured out a way (yet) to modify it in a way that steals money, does not make it particularly acceptable.

I bought a car, and I sold a bunch of bitcoins for a down payment on it, so it's not technically accurate to say I "bought the car with bitcoins" since I didn't pay for the whole thing that way.
It sure helped though and I probably wouldn't have bought the car if I hadn't made so much in returns on my bitcoin investment.  I sold 16 grand worth of bitcoins, the car cost a lot more than that though.

What prices have *I* bought at?
Here's a list of the price every time I bought in the past year.  Obviously I bought mostly at the lower price points.  Once I got past October of last year most of my bitcoin purchases were so that I could buy things online without having to use my credit card or just slowly grow my holdings a bit more.
In November I sold enough bitcoins to get back my entire original investment back out, bringing my cost basis to zero.  Since then I have bought some more higher priced coins so that now my current average buy price is $50 per bitcoin.
SOLD AT : $325.81

So, my goal is to show, *EVERY SINGLE BITCOIN ADDRESS*  every single one.
And let you see it in relationship by size and date with every single other bitcoin address, over time.  And I want you to be able fly around the data interactively and view it.  I want you to be able to see new addresses spring into existence, old addresses go away, and addresses woosh/move/animate as they move through time.
I want you to be able to interactively select, with the mouse, any address and inspect it.  
So, this is like version 0.000000000000001 of an app that I'm working on.  Maybe I should just delete the video, as it's probably way too early to be showing it in public yet.

* Step  : Go to this website: 
* Step  : Select 'Paper Wallet'
* Step  : Enable the checkbox 'BIP 38 Encrypt'
* Step  : Where it says passphrase enter a relatively difficult password, this protects your funds from being stolen even if someone were to get a copy of the paper wallet.
* Step  : Decide how many paper wallets you want, the default is 3, then click 'Generate'
* Step  : Print out *several* copies of the paper wallets on your printer.  You could also make a digital copy as well if you wanted by printing them to a PDF file; or scanning them in with a scanner if you don't know how to print to a PDF.
* Step  : Send bitcoins to the public keys on the paper wallets, this 'funds' them.
* Step  : Save multiple copies in multiple locations.  If you are concerned about somehow paper being destroyed, you can save digital copies as well (like as a PDF file for example on a thumb drive.)  While it is unlikely anyone could ever guess your passphrase best practices dictate that you never store the digital copy anywhere online.  Instead store it on a couple of USB sticks and put them in a safe in a couple of locations.  Because of the passphrase (BIP38 encryption) even if someone steals your bitcoin paper wallets they cannot redeem the funds.  Obviously the passphrase should be reasonably secure.
That's all there is to it.   My recommendation is not to put all of your eggs in one basket.  Say you have 10 bitcoins, even though you could put them all on a single paper wallet, I would recommend consider creating ten paper wallets and put one bitcoin on each.  That is what I do.  The reason for this is because some day, in the future, when you want to redeem/spend those bitcoins, you can bring them back online to a hot wallet one at a time instead of all at once.

I think ethereum is adding complexity for the sake of complexity. They are using magical thinking that if they create a Turing complete system then "anything is possible" when, in fact, a well defined contract protocol and a well defined DAC protocol would actually be better.

Yes they are. I built the source and stepped through the VM in a debugger today.

You are somewhat correct, they cannot do much about peer-to-peer bitcoin only transactions.  However, even that isn't assured.  I can imagine a cop setting up a sting operation to buy some bitcoin and then arrest the person.  In fact, I can imagine this all too easily.
What they will mostly do is just create chokeholds at every point where someone might want to use bitcoin to buy something of value on the general market.  They will control where fiat gets converted to bitcoin and back (they are already doing that aggressively) and they will control where people can spend bitcoins at legitimate businesses.
If you can't convert bitcoins to and from any fiat currency, if you can't use them at legitimate businesses, then the only thing left is the black-market.  
The United States already has millions of people locked up for non-violent 'crimes', like growing and or smoking a weed.  There are plenty more in jail for the 'crime' of violating their financial rules.
The state has a tremendous amount of power in the form of violence which they can, and do, wield whenever they wish.  Look at local police stations being given heavy military equipment.  Cops killing and beating people up.  In fact, there was recently a ruling that police forces can intentionally disqualify intelligent people from being cops.
Sorry to be so depressing but the on the ground reality in the United States is one of a brutal police state with a massive surveillance infrastructure which destroys all privacy.
The only hope for bitcoin is that other countries will allow it to flourish and the US will have to walk a middle ground so that they are not 'left out'.  However, that's not really all that realistic either because the US is a bully which wields it's power over the rest of the world without much restraint.
Bitcoin is a direct challenge to that power, not just the power of the government to control the people but the power of the banks to keep them in slavery.  So, yeah, not gonna be an easy fight.

The semi-realistic extremely bullish take on bitcoin is probably around 10k per in a couple of years. That would give you $100k, call that $70k after taxes. A hell of a nice return. You could buy a corvette, a piece of land, a down payment on a house, or pay off a bunch of student loans.
All great things, some even life changing, but you aren't going to retire on it.
For decades, that is so hard to even imagine. I suppose it could be some astronomical number or, more likely, zero.

I think any very 'strong' password is sufficient.  And, even though there is probably no real risk, I gotta wonder why ever email it or otherwise store it anywhere online?  Seems kind of contrary to the purpose.

What counts as 'accessed' is any spend transaction.  Receiving money does not count since anyone can send money to an address and it would be false to assume that sending money to an address somehow marks it as 'alive' or in active control by the owner.  We see this with famous old addresses like the genesis block getting spammed with deposits all of the time, even though there has never been a spend transaction from that original 50btc block reward.
That is the public key address of the first block-reward ever mined by Satoshi in the genesis block.  Note that there are 880 transactions, some as recent as yesterday.  However, in my chart, that address is still considered 5 years old because no spend has ever occurred from that address.

I showed you C++ bit shifting code that isn't simply halving. This has nothing to do with floating point. The question is why exponential instead of linear. The answer is that it was an arbitrary decision which has some nasty consequences as the reward halving over time will throw the mining economy into chaos.

I was being sarcastic. The real question is if they insist on using a VM then why write their own?
That makes no sense at all.  They use an industry standard cryptographic library so why not use an industry standard VM?
One that has an existing high level of security, full functioning, and a large array of existing development tools?
All embedded VM's can be easily expanded so anything custom they feel is required for the crypo system could easily be added as a "package" on top of an existing proven technology?
I would never try to write a custom VM from scratch if my goal was to be completely general purpose and Turing complete.
It makes no sense to write their own crippled, limited, and untested VM from scratch. No sense at all.

You are misunderstanding.  If it moves from the mining pool to another users address, and that user *never* moves their coins, then they are included in the list.  This is about public-key addressees with no send transactions.
So, in the example you cite, the mining pool would have a 'live/used' address, but that doesn't mean the end user who got the payout is automatically considered 'live'.  Their payout address is only 'live' if they, in turn, spend the bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:57:20
Yes and no.  It accounts for *all* bitcoins, so long as those companies aren't performing fractional reserve, it does represent all of theirs too.  However, what this means is some of the very big chunks, say 5k or greater bitcoins could represent the cold storage for exchanges which, in turn, represent the 'off ledger' balances of hundreds of thousands of individuals.
It's just really tough to read too much into individual bitcoin holders and distribution by bitcoin public keys.  It's interesting data but it can lead people to false conclusions as well.

The solution to true micro-transactions will come in the form of a service, like changetip, or sidechains.  Tying up the main bitcoin blockchain for microtransactions is probably not the right way to go about it.  You don't need to worry about 'centralization' of a service like 'changetip' since the funds involved are very small.

For a total of 67,021 coins, figuring an average price of $500 that's approximately 34 million US or so.  Out of the two million that still remain untouched, that's kind of a drop in the bucket though.  The fact that they come to life in spurts on certain dates is kind of interesting though.

Look, I'm a libertarian enough.  I generally believe that all victimless crimes shouldn't be, well crimes.  If there is no victim, there is no crime.  However, there are plenty of crimes with victims, including some really heinous crimes like child-pornography which is spread directly through technology like the 'DarkMarket'.  
It is irresponsible to develop a 'marketplace' which facilitates criminals to abuse women and children under the cover of complete anonymity and protection.
In your world should child-pornographers be able to distribute images of their victims world-wide completely cloaked by technology that you develop?  That's not the world I want to live in or the kind of technology project I wish to support.
It doesn't sound like 'DarkMarket' has any concrete plans to restrict, ban, or otherwise limit this kind of activity.  Until they have such a plan, I won't support this project in any way, shape, or form.

I disagree.  While a bar chart does a good job of showing the relative sizes, what it doesn't do is easily visualize the relative size of the sums.  In other words, at a glance, the pie chart let's me tell that 'half of all' of these items are within a certain range.

People are already ignoring the self reporting of sales tax on online sales. That was my point.
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:52:13
The scenario I see is this.  Right now they are attacking the choke points where bitcoins are converted to fiat and back, because they can regulate the shit out of that and people generally need to use fiat to do anything of real value.
However, in a future where people don't bother to convert to fiat, the next step is that they attack businesses.  They either simply make it illegal for businesses to accept bitcoin or they put onerous KYC/AML requirements on them for large purchases to the point that it's more trouble for those businesses to accept bitcoin than it is worth.
The point is, I don't see how they are going to 'allow' millions of dollars to be transferred without them having any way to control it, cut it off, or track it.
So, back to my original question, you are saying there is no interest or plans on the part of the US government to 'regulate' direct peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions?
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:37:40
I think the government threats are very, very, real.  They can start arresting people or fining them.  This has already happened in select cases and will only grow larger.  Look at operations like Cryptsy.  A completely unregulated exchange.  All of these exchanges which just let you trade crypto-currency for crypto-currency, those guys are gonna be fucked.
They could require that all bitcoin addresses be registered.  They could require blacklists. They could apply all kinds of burdensome and onerous rules on businesses which accept bitcoin as payment.
Want to buy a $50,000 car with bitcoin?  The government is going to want to know about that.
The laundry list of things the government can do to harass and frighten people is long.  Businesses are risk averse.  If they think accepting bitcoin puts them at risk, and it will only take a few arrests for them to treat bitcoin like kryptonite, they will drop it like a hot potato.
I put the threat of government regulation and scare tactics as having a strong probability of destroying the value of bitcoin.

I think this conversation has devolved a bit.  Most people don't understand computers in any particular detail.  My original post was simply using the analogy that most of the average persons 'money' already exists on computers that they do not control or understand.  Bitcoin is just another version of digital money.  The actual value judgement about who's system is better or worse, etc. is obviously a much more involved and detailed conversation.
When people used to walk around with most of their spending money in the form of actual cash, I could understand the average person's confusion.  But, today, people hardly carry around any cash at all.  They use debit and credit cards which transfer entries in databases on computers that they do not control or understand.  In that respect, bitcoin is just another way to send value using computers.  
It's as much 'money' as the database entries in their other accounts and, I would argue, even better because they have more direct control over that form of digital money.
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:27:36
I just came up with the most amazing idea of how to visualize the blockchain in 3d.
What I'm going to do is take like the top 50,000 addresses. Every address is displayed as a color coded 3d box. Each box is scaled in size relative to its total value. Boxes are stacked/packed in a 3d grid. On another axis boxes are placed based on their age.
In this way you will see, in an interactive 3d app, *every single address*  as a discrete 3d graphic.
Now, the cool part, you will be able to animate this 3d model over time! When new addresses appear the box will animate. When old addresses are gone they will animate away. When an address changes value it will grow bigger or smaller.  When it changes age it will animate to its new location on the timeline. 
Boxes will retain a persistent look and location so you will be able to track by color coding specific addresses moving around.
This will be a real time interactive 3d app that you can spin and rotate. If you hover over a box with the mouse it will display its address. If you click it, it will open the address in block explorer.
Imagine something like a Rubik's cube but with different sized cubes to represent different bitcoin amounts.
I'm thinking this could be really cool. Since my background is in 3d game programming this is actually a simple project. 
I will try to make a prototype of this visualization in the next day or so.

This country has lost it's moral authority over the past decade.  An answer of 'simply do what the state tells you without question' is not a good answer.  I do not think a free person in a free society should have to give up all of their rights to financial control, whether that is using private money or simply moving their own money around as they wish, simply because the state says so.

Yeah, it occurred to me the reason development is moving slow is, in part, due to the insane risk involved in releasing a new version of the protocol that might introduce a bug.  I work in video games, if we release something with a bug, no big deal, we just release a patch.  But if your bitcoin release has a bug it could accidentally destroy 100% of the value over night.

Dude, the blockchain is a *public* record.  It is designed to be researched and analyzed.  
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:54:00
Because a brain-wallet password *is* your private key and it's a very low-resolution private key. 
What keeps bitcoin wallets safe is the fact that the private key is a very, very, very, large random number.  
A brain-wallet is almost, by definition, a much smaller number.  The reason people use a brain-wallet is because a full bitcoin private key is such a massive number that is is considered virtually impossible to memorize.  So, instead, people pick something that is easier to remember.
It's not that a brain-wallet couldn't be as secure as a bitcoin private key, however, for it to be that secure it would have to be just as huge and impossible to memorize.
A Brain-Wallet password encodes exactly *ONE* private key.  If it has even 1 bit less precision than an actual bitcoin private key, then it is less secure.
On the other hand, a BIP38 password is simply used to obscure an already highly secure private key.
A single BIP38 password could be used to encode an infinite number of bitcoin private keys.
I hope this explanation makes sense.

Bitcoin has worked fine at many market prices, it comes down to how much value you want/need to move through the system. I think the technical term is the 'velocity' of money.
Right now the bitcoin network supports hundreds of millions of dollars worth of value to move every month.
However, if use grows and suddenly the network needs to move billions of dollars of value then the market price needs to grow to meet that demand.
Back when bitcoin was worth just a couple of dollars each the network supported a much smaller amount of value.

So, a lot of these guys give some very complex scenarios requiring a lot of technical knowledge that is probably overkill.  I've been guilty of over-thinking it in the past as well.
You can be pretty secure with a much simpler approach.
Coinbase will now allow you to create and print a paper wallet.  Do so.  Then transfer the vast majority of your bitcoins to it (send to the public key on the paper wallet).  Make multiple copies of your paper wallet and store them safely.
The remaining amount of bitcoin treat as 'spending' money and you can use a cell phone application as your primary way to access it.  Sure, there is some small level of security risk but it is small and you are only talking about pocket change.
When you transfer to paper wallets, don't keep transferring to the same paper wallet.  Make multiple paper wallets each containing a maximum amount of bitcoin that makes sense to you (no more than 1btc is my recommendation).
Then, when you need to 'spend' some bitcoin, you can simply import the private key from one of your paper wallets that has just the amount you are willing to transfer at a time.
This is pretty secure and safe, pretty simple, and a lot easier than installing Ubuntu and doing all of those other steps.
You can get paranoid, and to a certain degree it is justified, but you can find a middle ground too.

The reason that I think they 'cashed out' is because the blocks mined over a one week period early in the history of the blockchain have been moved in groups several times in the past 9 months, each time corresponding to large spikes in the price.  Like I said, the raw data will be provided shortly and everyone can just look at it directly for themselves.  One of the moves was over a million dollars worth of bitcoin (from exactly this set of mined blocks) right when bitcoin hit it's all time high.

I think the best approach is to strengthen and support bitcoin as the core value infrastructure and not undercut it by creating competing systems. Then you can build layers on top of it that add additional services.  I think a well defined and secure protocol that provides specific services is a more secure solution than an open ended programmable model which is fraught with potential problems. Complexity breeds bugs and bugs in a cryptocurrency can destroy the value and faith stored in them.

Yeah, apparently others have complained in the past, I am not the first.  This is just one more reason why I absolutely refuse to use any 3rd party wallet service.  I do use coinbase to buy bitcoins but the moment they arrive I transfer them directly to a wallet that I control.  In fact, I don't hold any bitcoins on any third party sites for any reason.  Even if I want to play around with an alt-coin, I transfer a deposit, make a trade, and then *immediately* withdraw it.  
The biggest appeal of bitcoin to me is controlling my own money, so letting some 3rd party host my wallet seems entirely against that ethos.
@_date: 2014-06-16 17:51:29
Bitcoin already makes extensive use of fixed point math as it is.  This really isn't enough reason for it.  Fixing point or floating point, either way, decreasing the miners reward at a rate different than just 'half' is not a rational technical reason because a single shift is easier than say dividing by 1/4, or 1/8, or 1/16, or 1/64th, all of these can still be accomplished with simple shift arithmetic.  
I think the question here isn't technical, it's about economics.  What is the economic rationale to halve the reward at fixed intervals versus adapting it more smoothly over time?

Sorry, not sure what is 'wrong' about my statement?  If the brain-wallet passphrase has fewer bits of entropy then it is less secure.  If you are saying that they can generate a passphrase, one which can be memorized, that still has the same number of bits of entropy as a standard private key then, yeah, I guess that is true.  Most people are not doing that though I would imagine.  I did say in my post that if you create a brain-wallet passphrase with just as many bits of entropy as a standard private key then, yes, it is secure.  The only thing I suppose you are arguing about is whether or not such a thing can be 'easily memorized'.  Maybe it can, I'm a bit skeptical though.  At any rate, I much prefer BIP38 myself.
It is also true that one brain-wallet passphrase produces exactly one private key.

Bitcoin debit cards are just a bridge, an important bridge. Bitcoin has a chicken and egg problem, debit cards solve that.
Overnight everyplace in the world will accept bitcoin whether they know it or not. 
People haven't even begun to understand how significant this is. So long as the ability to "hot load" the debit card remains, then you can use it to send money to anyone anywhere on the planet by beaming it straight to their debit card.
In time businesses will realize that they could save money by just accepting bitcoin directly. In the meantime we can grow the bitcoin economy worldwide by piggybacking on top of the legacy system.
The important point is that *we* hold bitcoins and we control our own money.
Think of this scenario. You have a friend or relative overseas. They have a bitcoin debit card. You can hot-load their card on the fly almost instantaneously. And you, personally, don't pay any fees. The merchant does.
In time more and more merchants will realize that they should have been accepting bitcoin directly all along and make the switch.
Bitcoin backed debit cards that can be hot-loaded would be the single biggest event towards global worldwide acceptance.
My fear is that the banks can't be that stupid and they won't allow it because allowing a bitcoin debit card to run on their network would be a form of, not that slow, suicide.

I just sent the following email to the author of this article:
I wanted to give you a different point of view about your recent article.
The first is regarding your statement that bitcoin has no intrinsic value.  It actually does.  It's intrinsic value comes from the network which backs it up and that networks's ability to provide nearly frictionless transmission of value.  It is literally, and I mean quite literally, like stating that email has no intrinsic value.  Bitcoin is a value transmission protocol and that, certainly, has some intrinsic value.  How much value that is will be determined by the market, which is happening now.
The second thing I wanted to caution you about is assuming that the MtGox exchange had a bunch of money stolen.  This is very much open for debate at this time.  The current working theory, backed up by a lot of circumstantial evidence, is that the money was never stolen, it was more likely frozen by the US government as part of an active investigation and the principals are all under a gag order not to talk about it.
 
Even if this is not the case, there is still no evidence that anything was stolen, far more likely the principals in this case were running a fraud and now they are paying the price.
Conflating one bad exchange that has been in its death throes for almost a year, is not the same thing as the damning the system as a whole.
Just as when the Fed's shuttered Silk Road last year, so will the shuttering of MtGox be a very healthy step forward in the evolution and maturation of bitcoin technology.
Finally, don't confuse short term growing pains with the long term potential. Actually the volatility of the price of bitcoin has been decreasing over time.  The measure of success or failure of bitcoin will happen on an order of years and, over years, volatility will decrease as the regulatory landscape becomes more clear and greater adoption and acceptance takes place.
Most importantly, the technology underlying bitcoin cannot be 'uinvented'.  Even if bitcoin fails, and becomes the 'myspace' of cryptographic currencies, the fact remains that this technology is here to stay in whatever form it ultimately manifests.
It seems absurd that in 2014 when we can send a text message or email to nearly any person on the planet in an instant, that it still takes days and massive fees to send a small amount of money to anyone internationally.  Billions on the planet are unbanked and lack access to basic financial services while, at the same time, these billions do have access to cell phones.  International remittance and commerce are huge markets that will be greatly expanded with the advent of digital value transmission protocols.
Try sending 25 cents to someone in another country using any other mechanism than a cryptocurrency.  The simple fact is that you cannot.  Don't confuse growing pains with the truly revolutionary promise of this incredible technology.
If you needed any more proof that digital value transfer is the future of finance, check out this website.  
At first glance you might think you are reading about bitcoin but, actually, this is brought to you by the existing international banking system, Visa and Citibank.   I'm not a big fan, personally, but it shows that digital value transfer is the future.

I probably should have written up a whole article on this, but it's late, and I don't have the time.  I reran the blockchain against my statistics tool to produce this graph.  The funny thing is my tool is very close to no longer working.  
My tool was designed for speed so it loads the entire blockchain into RAM.  However, the blockchain is now so large it can no longer easily fit into memory which means I probably need to rewrite my code to store everything into a database which will make it much slower.
There are now about 53,644,262 unique bitcoin addresses which have ever been used in history and this is growing very quickly now that most wallets generate a unique address for every single transaction.  Needless to say, this consumes a ton of memory to collate.
This graph shows, I believe, a reasonable measure of 'liquidity', in other words a measure of all bitcoins in existence, how many move each day, week, month, etc.
As you can see on average somewhere between 10% and 30% of all bitcoins move every month.
Personally, I take this as a sign of a pretty healthy and dynamic economy.
Look at it this way.  Imagine if 10-20% of all of the gold in the world was moving every month.  That would definitely be a sign of a healthy gold market I would think.
Here is the raw CSV data, feel free to make a nice sexy USA-Today style graph and upload it here.
** EDIT ** Additional data.
Someone asked to see a version of this chart zoomed into focus on just over the past year. Here is the link.
You will notice that as the year has progressed there have been more holders but, still, over 10% of all bitcoins are active any given month.
We cannot conclude whether this 10% represents commerce (legal or otherwise), traders, or merely people moving coins from one wallet to another. However, it does show that the network is being used to transact a lot of value; which is really it's primary purpose.
Here is the list of the 3,353 zombie events which have occurred over the lifetime of the blockchain, sorted by age of last use. This list defines a 'zombie' event as a bitcoin address which had previously had no spend transactions for over three years.
As you can see, 3,353 is not a lot of transactions compared to the millions which are performed every year, so as we can conclude that very old bitcoins moving is a relatively rare event.
List provided as a simple CSV text file.
Here is a graph of these zombie events by day over time:
In case you are curious about those who really huge spikes above 4,000 bitcoins, here they are in the blockchain:
10,000 bitcoins which moved on April 4, 2014 after sitting unused since April 18, 2011.
6,705 bitcoins which moved on December 20, 2013 after sitting unused since December 18th, 2010:

Yesterday I posted some graphs that I created based on some analysis I had done on the current blockchain.  They got quite a few upvotes and positive comments, but a lot of people criticized the graphs themselves.  For the record, all I did was just right click on the data in Excel and do a default graph.  However, it seems there are a lot of graph artisans here on Reddit who have strong opinions about how data should properly be presented.
Therefore I am making the raw data available here and I encourage people to create their own graphs and attach them here in the comments.  I eagerly await your stunning graphs, bar charts, and scatter plots.  Go have fun.
This data was produced from the following open source tool that parses the raw blockchain.  Feel free to download and build the code if you want to verify the raw data itself.

I meant like a 100% profit; meaning a $100 investment earns $200. I probably phrased it wrong but that is what I meant. Like if you invested $100 and it rose to $120 that would be a 20% return on the original investment. So a 100% return would mean double your money.

If bitcoin stayed at $500 and never fluctuated up or down by more than 1% for fifty years I would be perfectly happy.  In fact, that would be a phenomenal outcome as far as I'm concerned.  Unfortunately, the math doesn't work that way.  If it's around for 50 years it must increase in value due to the design.

So, I would love to have a decentralized peer-to-peer market place.  That would be so awesome.  On the other hand, I won't be comfortable participating in a marketplace which offers products that I find, personally, morally objectionable.  I realize that every person probably has a different opinion as to what is, or is not, morally objectionable.
For me to use this, I would need to have some assurance that I could restrict my view only see and participate in categories that I personally am comfortable with.
If not, then I'm going to be sloshing around in the same marketplace that is selling child pornography and killers for hire.  Thanks, but no thanks.

Apparently you didn't read what I wrote. Major companies are not going to switch to bitcoin, and its lower costs, until they are convinced it is safe and legal and worth it to them to do so. A transitional period using the existing payment system is what will convince the big retailers to make the switch.
Once they realize that a massive volume of sales is being done through bitcoin, only then are they going to be convinced to switch over.
See chicken and egg....
This is the Trojan horse way to drag them onto the new cheaper and more efficient payment network. This is about transitioning them out of the 1950's technology and into the future.

Really? I fail to understand? I've been coding in C, C++, and assembly language for 34 years, in total a few million lines of code.
Now, explain to me, what use is there for embedding a Turing complete virtual machine in the middle of a transaction processing system? 
I'm open minded. Show me the code. I'm really curious.
Or, perhaps, is this all smoke and mirrors and "build it and they will come" logic?
How many instructions are allowed in the code? How much instruction space and ram? How big is the stack? Is there a limit on recursion? Does it allow pointer math? How large can loops be? Does it support concurrency? 
What computation is this for? How does the computation run? When, where, to what ends?
Name the last time you sent a bitcoin transaction and thought, damn, if I could just run thousands of lines of code on thousands of miners machines I could solve my problem?
When you read their white paper almost all of it is about standard altcoin metrics and almost nothing about this virtual machine and, when you get to that, it's just hand waving and claims that it can 'just do anything'.
There are a whole lot of big problems with cryptocurrencies and a more advanced scripting system is way down at the bottom of the list of priorities.
Right now our biggest issues are DDOS attacks, transaction malleability, and scalability. Let's focus on that first.

Sure, I guess I get that.  However, if it is already priced in it's doubtful it will go down much either.
Here is the thing, I'm not the only guy who is into bitcoin and has a 401k.  Like others, I have been investing my 'extra' money in bitcoin over the past year, others even longer.  I would imagine that most of us who are already investing in bitcoin would absolutely love to shift at least a portion of our 401k into bitcoin.  I would shift 10% (long-term and ongoing contributions) over night.
However, it is bigger than that.  The millions of investors who have Etrade, Schwabb, and Fidelity accounts have never had a chance to buy so much as a fraction of a bitcoin to date.  The amount of media hype surrounding bitcoin over this past year I believe has created a great deal of pent up demand.  I suspect quite strongly that the average home hobbyist trader would buy 'at least just a little bit' of a bitcoin ETF on day one.  
I may be wrong, but I suspect the level of pent up demand for people to just dip their toes into bitcoin that can be publicly traded is really, really, strong.  I'm not suggesting that all of these people intend to take some sort of big position in bitcoin, but I am suggesting that many of them will at least buy a little bit for fun and out of curiosity.
If the launch of a public bitcoin ETF doesn't nearly double the price of bitcoin in a month I will be very surprised.

Ok, no more guess work.  Here is an exhaustive list of early bitcoin blocks which were spent over the course of the past year or so.  You guys can interpret this how you will. When I say very early I mean just that, only coins mined in the first two months of the blockchain. 
There were 200 bitcoins moved on February 7, 2014 in four transactions.
There are 1,850 bitcoins moved between November 15-18, 2013 from a range of early bitcoin block addresses.
There were 200 bitcoins moved on October 9, 2014.
Finally, during the early run-up in price of 2013 a total of 3,532 bitcoins moved between April 5, 2013 and May 28, 2013.
Here is a link to the summary of these events.

Some of these startups are based on the technology only, but others are based on specifically on value transfer.  And value transfer means bitcoin, because all of the other cryptographic networks have way too small of a market cap to be useful.  Not only that, but bitcoin's current market cap needs to grow substantially for the value transfer to accomplish their goals.

4,000 transactions per second is 571 times as many as our currently supported at the one megabyte blocksize limit.  This means a single block would have to be 571mb; or over one half a gig of data.  This would produce 30,011 gigabytes in the blockchain per year, or a total of about 3 terrabytes.  Now, we can talk about how bandwidth and disk-storage are cheap but I remain skeptical.
I think we can probably increase the current block-size by a factor of 10 without causing any sort of emergency, but by a factor of 571, that seems a bit doubtful to me.
But, seriously, I hope you are right.

Shhhhhshhhh...nobody tell them that bitcoin's price is intrinsically linked to its usefulness as a payment gateway. 
You can't use it to make payments unless it has value, and not just any value, but enough liquid value to support the level of commerce being conducted on the network.  
For example you can't use Ron Paul coin to send a million dollars. There isn't enough liquidity. If bitcoin needs to accommodate a much higher volume of liquid value then price will have to expand to support it.

It's very entertaining and, quite frankly, I think this week is going to be one of the best for bitcoin's history.  A lot of people forget that bitcoin is a living breathing community and ecosystem which is resilient to attack.
Every time it gets attacked it becomes stronger on the other side.  This is all a huge buying opportunity and once a few weeks pass and, yet once again, bitcoin has not actually died, people are going to realize it's got legs.
If I had a millibit for every time bitcoin has been declared 'dead' I would be a very rich man.  Like many, I'm in this for the long haul.  I will measure the failure/success of bitcoin on a scale of years from now.  These are just growing pains and, quite frankly, buying opportunities.
Bitcoin might well fail and be worth zero some day.  I fully accept that as a possible outcome.  However, events like this week strengthen it rather than the opposite.
Who thinks another fucking illegal drug site going down is going to be 'bad news' in the long term?  Who thinks MtGox going belly up is going to be 'bad news' in the long term?
This is like ridding ourselves of toxins at this point.  I would also like to point out that for all the bitching the feds do about how bitcoins can be used for illegal activities, they seem to be having no difficulties arresting people lately.  They have been more successful, by far, arresting people in the virtual currency space than they have arresting bankers who have laundered a hundred thousand times more money.  You know, maybe one of these days people are going to notice the discrepancy.  Either admit that bitcoin is small potatoes and not really all that hard to deal with from a criminal perspective or start arresting bankers at HSB and JP Morgan.  They need to make up their mind.
And, seriously, the community should start demanding that the real money launders (the *people* at the big banks) start getting arrested.  The law should be applied equally!

Guys, you can buy an Android tablet for like $50 and use it as a your mobile wallet.  Not ideal, but if you can't get out of your iPhone contract or whatever, it's a perfectly reasonable compromise.  It is also a great way for you to get familiar with the Android OS and realize that you might just prefer it in the long run.  Set up your iPhone as a wi-fi hotspot and just use the Android tablet as a mobile wallet.  No ideal, I know, but it's a way to bridge the gap.
You can even buy the cheep Android phone from TigerDirect (or a number of other sites) using bitcoins.

I think the key observations are being able "see" the massive number of coins which sit unmoved over time.  The second interesting thing is to see how many coins stop moving since the beginning of the year.  This is rather natural as we have an extended period where the price is well below a previous all-time high.  Essentially showing what we all already think, which is many people are now strongly holding.
I also thought it was interesting to watch the massive amount of bitcoins which were liquid when the first real trading periods were getting going with bitcoins.
Essentially just realize the left hand side of the graph is liquidity, coins associated with addresses showing spend transactions over the previous day, week, and month.
The further you get to the right (past a year or two) are all coins which are lost, dormant, of waiting to come out of hibernation and kill the market.

Well, my company gives me stock awards in lieu of cash bonues.  I am taxed when the stock is given to me.  So, say they award me 100 shares of stock; I don't *get* 100 shares of stock.  I get like maybe 75 and they sell the other 25 to take out the taxes owed *at the time of the award*.

Yes, I ran some trivia contests with BIP38 wallets to educate people a while back.  
I'll give you an example.
Here is a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet.
Here is the public key address:
It contains 5 millbits (about $3) worth of bitcoin.
You have the private key in the image above, but that private key has been encrypted.  To retrieve the money you must know the password.
Here is the private key:
The password is the answer to a trivia question.  The trivia question is related to movies and refers to a particular action movie.
The clue is: "What was written on the side of the stolen black truck in pursuit of a taxi?"
The answer is two words, all upper-case.  Once you guess the correct password, you can 'sweep' the funds.

Obviously my late night post was just an alcohol fueled rant that I assumed, as is true on most occasions, I would regret in the morning.
Probably what I was surprised by the most in the comments, were people who didn't think my assertion that bitcoin is tiny relative to banks and world-government fiat.  That seems kind of self-evident to me.  Others didn't believe the claim that MasterCard, banks, and world governments are attacking bitcoin.  This seems kind of self-evident to me if you read this sub at all, as we post every news story about it daily.  Heck, the big story of the past 24 hours news cycle has been the near collapse of the Russian ruble, a government which has made the use of bitcoin illegal.  So, yeah, I think that kind of proves the point just a bit.
So, to back up some of the statements above.
Here is a link to a Forbes article talking about the $190 billion dollars a year in credit card fraud that is currently just taken as an 'acceptable' loss.  That was in reference to my statement that the daily transaction volume of bitcoin amounts to 'rounding' error for the big banks.  They accept 38 times the market cap of bitcoin *annually* as just a write off.
Some people thought I threw out a straw-man claiming MasterCard was attacking bitcoin. You can dismiss the now infamous YouTube video:
What is more significant are lobbying efforts at world-governments who are considering legislation of bitcoin. Lobbyists are expensive and you don't pay them to attack something unless you consider it a threat.
Finally, there is the question of whether world-governments care enough about bitcoin to attack or ban it.  Really?
While I can understand that some people don't care for my style of late night drunken rambling, I do think the substance of the argument was true.

What do you mean by 'taking the karma hits'?  I know there are a lot of downvotes (141) but there are also 472 upvotes, with 76% liking the picture.  Wouldn't that mean a net increase in karma of 331 points?
I had no way to predict that a quick throwaway picture I took with my cell phone would 'go viral' so to speak and get this many hits.  This was just a follow up to a thread from a week ago where another user (CoinCult) created this image with input from the community.  I just wanted to post the image to show that someone had actually used the image he created.
I get the argument that using Dorian's likeness in a cartoon is somehow offensive but I kind of hope the man is capable of taking a joke.  Anyone who walks out his front door to face a mob of reporters and shouts out "Who's going to buy me a free lunch?" has got to have a sense of humor.
This image was not made out of spite or malice.  It was made to poke fun at the absurdity of this entire situation and with a certain amount of fondness for Dorian.
That's the way I feel about it.  All that said, I get it if some people can't take a joke or think it's in poor taste.
Looking at the votes here, it appears that 76% of users have a sense of humor about this and 24% do not.  I can accept that.

Here is the letter I just sent to Senator Manchin:
I appreciate your concern for the citizens of this country, but I am afraid that you may have a deep lack of understanding of the technology underlying bitcoin.
A few things you should be aware of.
(1) Bitcoin is a protocol, not a currency per-se.  It is a way to transmit information over the Internet and that information can represent 'value' if the sender chooses to treat it that way.  From a technical standpoint, it actually cannot be shut down without shutting down the Internet itself.
(2) This technology/protocol cannot be un-invented.  It has already been copied thousands of times and is replicated all over the world in multiple forms.  Banning bitcoin is like trying to ban email, twitter, or text messages.  It's really not practical.  
(3) Bitcoin is already being regulated by the US government.  All exchanges which convert bitcoins into US dollars and back are under strict regulatory requirements.  Your call for regulation is redundant, it's already happening.  And, as already pointed out above, a ban is impossible, especially in what is supposed to be a free country last I checked.
(4) Bitcoin works off of an open source public ledger that is 100% transparent.  It does not come even close to representing a significant problem for law enforcement more than cash does today; this isn't just my opinion this is what was said at recent Senate hearings on the topic.  It is important to remember that, of course, more illegal activity is done with the US dollar by orders upon orders of magnitude greater than ever has been done with bitcoin.  Yes, criminals try to use bitcoins for illegal activities, just as criminals will try to exploit any value system, but they have been caught, repeatedly, and shut down.  We don't make the US dollar illegal simply because criminals use it.  We don't shut down the Internet, and email, and text messages, because criminals use it either.  Likewise, shutting down bitcoin (which technically can't even be done) makes about as much sense.
(5) Many people in government and the technology industry have been steadily working together to create a better regulatory environment for this powerful technology which could change the world of finance and lift untold millions out of poverty.
(6) Our existing financial system uses ancient 1950's technology simply to transmit value around.  How is it that in 2014 when we can send an email or text message instantaneously it still takes days for money to be transferred around the world?  Why is it, in 2014, that when the technology has been in existence for over 20 years to protect users of banking services from being victims of identity theft, still the banking industry has done nothing about it?  Every year billions of dollars are lost and millions of people suffer from identity theft and credit card fraud.  Cryptocurrencies offer protection from these kinds of abuses.
(7) Banks have been predatory on the poor, raking them on service fees and overdraft charges.  Billions of people on the planet lack basic banking services but do have access to a cell phone.  The *protocol* in bitcoin affords the opportunity for all of these unbanked throughout the world to have access to international financial services.
(8) Realize that digital value transfer is going to be done by the banking system either way.  We should be in favor of free-market competition in this space and not give it up entirely to the predatory international banking system.
(9) You talk about crime that is being done with bitcoin while, apparently, ignoring the fact that international banks have been knowingly laundering hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money.  Not a single person has gone to jail.  If you are so legitimately concerned about financial crime, why not address these far more egregious offences as well?
(10) Finally, this last item.  Suggesting that the United States model it's financial policy after Russia and China is hardly a testament to American ideas of freedom and liberty.  You might want to rethink that argument...
Thank you for your time in considering in this matter.  I implore you to become better educated about the work being done to bring this incredible technology to the world and, please remember, it cannot be 'un-invented'.  Therefore it is better to work with industry partners than to send all of this business elsewhere in the world or give up the space to the International bankers who will continue to operate as they have been doing, which is to take advantage of the poor, deny access, and aid in criminal enterprise.

I think the biggest thing the average person has trouble getting their heads around is 'what makes it money', and once they realize that all of their 'money' is already just entries on a computer somewhere, that usually gets them a little closer to understanding.
@_date: 2014-07-09 22:18:59
I think you are correct.  Here is my analogy.  Already today billions of dollars of purchases made online (and this has been going on for years) are being made by tax dodgers.  
Almost nobody is aware that if you buy something online and the seller doesn't collect sales tax then you, personally, are responsible for self-reporting and sending it in with your state tax forms every single year (for those states which collect sales tax which is most of them).  This is really highly analogous to the bitcoin ruling with the exception that this is state and local taxes instead of federal.
This has been a massive loss of tax revenue for the states and has become a bigger and bigger issue to the point that new laws are being drafted to force online businesses doing more than one million dollars in sales to collect sales taxes (previously they were exempt since they only had to collect tax for the state the business was registered in).
So, here we have a long track record of the general public ignoring nuisance and impractical tax laws that made no sense whatsoever.
I think calculating capital gains on a cup of coffee bought with bitcoin probably falls in the same category.  Nobody is going to report it, and nobody is going to care, and eventually the rules will be revised to be something more sane.
All the IRS would have to do is make a rule that purchases under say $100 wouldn't be subject to capital gains / loss reporting.  That simple rule change would eliminate the bulk of bitcoin transactions for day to day use.
The threshold could be higher or lower, but either way, it's a simple practical solution.

Hot loading is extremely easy; and no I wouldn't do it 'for every purchase' but I wouldn't have a problem doing it every few days for walking around 'pocket' money.

It's still early dude.  Bitcoin is still held by only a very, very, few number of people.  If (and of course that's a big if) it reaches wide scale adoption then obviously anyone investing today is still an early adopter.
Bitcoin is a risky bet, nobody should invest more than they are willing to lose entirely.  However, the bet anyone is making today is based on the hope that it will, one day in the future (measured on a time scale of years) reach much wider adoption.
That may never happen.  In fact, the odds are probably against it.  That's what makes it such a risky bet.  However, and let's be clear, this still makes people entering today 'early adopters' by definition.

I suspect the majority of those keys are owned by Satoshi and I would, personally, consider it likely that he still controls the keys.  I get the impression that Satoshi was a very diligent and careful person when it came to his personal security and he obviously saw just how big of a thing bitcoin could become.
I suspect he probably does control the keys, but that is just a guess on my part based on assumptions about his personality.  Even if he has control over the keys, there is still a major question if he ever intends to use them.
The fact that he has never used them to date could be interpreted to mean that he never intends to use them.  Or, maybe, he is going to wait until he is worth a trillion dollars and make some grand gesture.
Who knows, but if he were to spend so much one millionth of a penny's worth today it would be a very, very, big deal.
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:49:25
Exactly, that's why it is so surprising to me that these old coinbase transactions haven't at least been moved to a newer, higher security, address.  It really does make you think they are abandoned.  And, as you point out, without them being claimed they could, in theory, be susceptible to ECDA being broken though, hopefully, that's not a realistic concern.

I have bought a lot of bitcoins on Coinbase over the last year yet my wallet balance has been under 5 millibits 99.999% of the time.

I'm not trolling.  The proposal is for 'DarkMarket', not 'FreeMarket'.  The proposal does not have any mechanism for moderating the market.  If you add such a proposal then maybe you will get some more support.  Until then, thanks but no thanks.  You act like creating a peer-to-peer market means 'it has no rules and the community cannot control what goes on it', but that is absurd.  
Just as bitcoin has rules that everyone must abide by, likewise a peer-to-peer market can have a set of rules as well.  The market is going to be comprised of a community, you can build in rules that allow that community to self-police what is allowed or not allowed to be posted.  
Even dumb old Reddit has a simple rule set that allow the community to upvote and downvote posts, raising and lowering their visibility.
But, to claim that you are going to create a peer-to-peer marketplace and cannot be held responsible for establishing a way for the marketplace to be moderated is a cop out.

Ok..if you don't consider $160 billion bullish, not sure what to say.  That's pretty bullish if you ask me.  I don't foresee bitcoin replacing visa, and mastercard, or any existing government fiat currency.  I do foresee it taking over much of the remittance market and some percentage of online payments, but even for those use cases you just need enough liquidity to transact value.  Meaning, if you want to service a 100 billion in annual remittance you don't need a market cap of 100 billion, you just need enough liquidity to transact 100 billion in a year, which is a much smaller cap.  
My biggest bull case is also the bubble case.  I can easily see many people using it as a 'store of value' (i.e. gold replacement).  That is probably the best argument to make for the bull case, is if people start parking portions of their retirement and other cold-storage value in it.

It's been a while since I updated these statistics, and there have been some significant developments I believe since the last time I did. 
What we are seeing is a lot of the 'zombie' coins getting coughed up and an ever shrinking pool of coins which refuse to budge, regardless of what happens to the bitcoin price.
Here are some additional statistics.
First, here is a list of all bitcoin public key addresses with a balance of 100btc or more.  As of today there are about 14,600 bitcoin public key addresses showing a balance of 100btc or more.  Obviously these addresses change fairly frequently, but it is interesting to see an updated list.  The spreadsheet also indicates the days since the last time a spend transaction was done from any key.
Here are the two graphs I find the most interesting.  First, is a graph of the total number of bitcoins in 'zombie' addresses over time.  These are bitcoins which have not had any spend transaction on them since prior to February 2013.  
What is particularly interesting in this graph is that there were about 5.5 million bitcoins considered 'zombies' prior to November of 2013.  
Obviously, as the price shot through the roof, this dislodged a lot of zombie coins which is reflected in the graph.
What remains, as of today, are 3.8 million zombie coins which reside in addresses which have had no send transactions since prior to February 2013.  That's right at about 30% of all bitcoins ever created.
As always, we have no way to be sure if these bitcoins are completely dead and lost forever or, perhaps, may rise from the dead at some point in the future to disrupt the market.
What I find particularly interesting is to see the coins which got 'shook loose' while bitcoin had it's big run-up in value over the past six months.
Finally, we have this very interesting graph which looks a lot like the 'bitcoin days destroyed' graph on blockchain.info but with one major difference.
This graph is in exact values.  It doesn't make a specific determination whether a zombie coin is one year old or four years old.  It is simply considered a zombie or not based on it having an original value a small fraction of the current market price.
So, this graph shows the exact number of bitcoins which 'rose from the dead' on any given day over the past year.
These spikes will be correlated to the bitcoin days destroyed graph on blockchain.info but on this graph you can see the exact value of how many bitcoins were involved.

Nice! I'm going to Zurich on Saturday, I will try to get to this machine and give it a try.  Here's a question, can I withdraw money or only convert fiat to bitcoin?

@_date: 2014-04-30 00:11:26
Not without a change to the protocol.
@_date: 2014-05-14 04:29:55
For what it's worth, it's scenarios like this which make me imagine a future where the idea of sending something like a $1 transaction on the bitcoin blockchain will sound absurd to the average person.
The blockchain may end up becoming the 'Fort Knox' of cryptocurrencies and serve as the primary backing/store of value while the vast majority of all transactions happen off-blockchain using either side-chains or third party processors.
The smallest transaction we might ever end up seeing on the blockchain itself could end up being $1,000 of value or more.
This leads to an interesting question.
We have all heard about the incredible transaction volumes that VISA and Mastercard process compared to bitcoin.  I wonder what percentage of those are over $1,000 apiece?  I wonder if they amount to 7TPS?
I think you are definitely onto something.  I do not believe that the core bitcoin protocol can accomodate any significant 'fix' to the transaction rate problem beyond just increasing the blocksize a little bit, which would barely be a weak band-aid at this point.
Innovation is going to have to happen *fast* far more quickly than the bitcoin core can accommodate.  Solutions will have to come elsewhere which, by the way, I'm fine with so long as they don't destroy the core value embedded in the blockchain itself.

First of all, we don't know for sure they are even going to allow bitcoin wallet apps and, if so, they will likely restrict them by country of origin and, of course, they can always just remove them on a whim.
All that said, there is a revolution going on and bitcoin is going to be a major player in a number of broad markets over the next few years.  For a company which prides itself for being on the leading edge of technology and innovation they cannot afford to stand on the wrong side of history here.
People can already get around their 'ban' by using HTML5 wallets and the old 'join my co-op' angle.
Finally, bitcoin is not illegal in many places in the world.  It is being used by ever larger and larger players.
Heck, we hear the announcements on this sub-reddit every day of the week about this company and then that company accepting it or developing products that are targeting mass adoption.
Just how long can Apple realistically afford to stay out of this?
They are gaining a well deserved reputation of being the NSA's best friend and a controlling nanny of their customers.  They are facing greater and greater competition from the Android ecosystem every day.

Governments "can" do all kinds of awful things to control people.

** Note **
I am *NOT* plastering these on people's cars.  That is just a photograph of a bunch of paper wallets that I printed out to hand out to people I meet.
The car those are on is my own car, the one I kind of bought with bitcoins back when they shot through the roof late last year.
I wanted to take a picture of the paper wallets and I was outside and it was convenient to stick them there for the photograph.  I didn't even think at the time that when I posted the photograph (and gave away a free lunch) that I would be implying I was putting those on people's cars at random.
I see now that is very obviously what people would think, but this was my mistake.
Yes, I printed out 20 bitcoin wallets.  Yes I'm planning on giving them out to strangers.  No, I am not putting them on people's cars.
I am handing them out whenever the topic of bitcoin comes up in conversation.  If people have read the Newsweek article, this makes a nice conversation starter as well.

So, DoctorDbx, you asked me a straight question and I gave you a straight answer.
How about you?  Will you answer straight?
Approximately how many bitcoins do you own and at what cost basis? How long have you been investing in the grand bitcoin social experiment?
What are your motivations in biticoin? To get rich?  To provide non-predatory financial services to the world population?  To protect yourself from identity theft in online transactions? To avoid using fiat currency?
To buy weed on Silk Road 3.0 the Honey Pot returns?
Inquiring minds want to know why your mind is so inquiring.  Ask me any of these questions, or more, and I will answer truthfully and honestly.  Will you?
I'm trying to convince others that they should, rationally, be making a long term investment in the future of bitcoin to change the world for good, all of the time realizing that this bet is very risky and they could lose their initial investment and should consider that risk accordingly.  That's what I'm trying to do.
How much skin do you have in the game?  What are your goals? Do you want bitcoin to succeed or fail, and in either case, why?
You seem so curious about us, but I'm terribly curious about you.

The last I ran stats recently and about 25% of all bitcoins are in addresses untouched for over two years. This is down from 30% when I wrote the zombie article. I will rerun the stats again this week, but probably somewhere around 20% of the total is a good guess.
So many people who mined bitcoins in the early days when they had no value just threw away or otherwise deleted their keys.

You, apparently, do not understand the concept of the 'velocity of money'.  Bitcoin was useless when it was worth a penny apiece. It had some utility at $1.  At $20 apiece it was useful for buying and selling weed online.  At $450 it has enough utility to support a certain level of remittance and commerce, but not a huge volume on a global scale.
These startups are investing on the hope that bitcoin serves as a major payment network.  For bitcoin to work as a major payment network then it must be able to transmit far more value than it can today.  For it to be able to transmit far more value it must have (A) a lot more liquidity and (B) a lot higher price.
It's called math.

My question is does this ruling mean that buying and selling bitcoin is subject to (A) sales tax and (B) property tax.  Gold is not subject to sales tax or property tax, but many other things which are bought and sold as 'property' are.

The issue is not about sales tax (VAT) its about avoiding capital gains/income tax because you used appreciated bitcoin/commodity to make the purchase.
Simple example. You buy 100 bitcoins for one dollar back a while ago. Now today you want to buy a Tesla. If you sell the 100 bitcoins for $85 grand you have to pay income tax on your gains. However, if instead of cashing out the bitcoin for US dollars to buy the car, instead you use bitpay to buy the car "directly" and, tada, bitpay has just helped you evade taxes on $85 grand of income.
This is not a hypothetical. I know people who have bought cars with bitcoin and have no intention of reporting it on their taxes.
Worse yet, it doesn't have to be a car. Even a single cup of coffee or any bitcoin purchase of goods or services represents a realized gain.
Today Overstock.com and BitPay are poised to become one of the biggest facilitators of tax evasion through this process.

What if your cold-storage wallet is encrypted with more security than the bitcoin key itself?  What's the risk?  I use a TrueCrypt volume to contain my cold storage keys.

I have often asked myself, what if bitcoin was completely non-anonymous would that make it useless?
I think the answer is that it would cripple it severely, but a lot of its core benefits would survive.
You could still transfer value around the world and it would still have a fixed monetary supply. That alone has some significant value in and of itself.
Frankly, if the powers that be, let that much survive it will still be an accomplishment.
I 'mix' all of my bitcoins, not because I'm dodging taxes or buying drugs online, but purely as a matter of privacy.

Not 100%.  There is a pattern of a transaction which indicates it might be the result of malleability, because the transaction (though valid) is not in a 'normal' or most common format.  You can infer somewhat, but it's still a bit of guesswork.

Actually, it is a valid criticism.  Most speculation on bitcoin is based on the notion that it will become a major payment network in the future.  If you are only holding, but not making use of the network, nor encouraging others to use the network, then some of the criticism is warranted.

I think you are wrong. Primarily because you posted a link to data that I, personally, extracted from the blockchain and has been wildly misrepresented.
Yes, 70% of all bitcoins represent either a store of value or are lost forever. A reasonable guess is 10% or slightly more are lost forever.
Do you really think that 30% of any commodity or currency changes hands every few months?
My data shows that a massive percentage of all bitcoins in existence move through the network on a regular basis.
That is a very positive sign and to try to spin that as a negative is ignoring every other commodity which acts as a store of value in existence.

Please don't be stupid.  The more that bitcoin is used as a payment network, the better it is for it's evolution as an important technology over time.  Bitcoin isn't just some kind of 'investment', it is a payment network.  It is a payment network independent of Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, SWIFT, and others.  When businesses use it as a payment network that it always a 'good thing'.  If they don't want to hold bitcoin, that is their choice.  However...as bitcoin makes it's slow march upwards some of them will probably be wishing they had.

I apologize for volunteering you. The simple fact is that you are an excellent spokesperson.
And, I do volunteer myself, for whatever that is worth, but I'm not nearly as well spoken as you are; though I do write from time to time.
Even though bitcoin is decentralized that doesn't mean the community cannot coordinate communication. Especially when you consider how many well funded businesses are invested in this endeavor and how strong the forces of FUD are at work.
I made this post late last night out of frustration that even pro-bitcoin sites were still misscharacterizing the malleability problem.
Maybe this issue is just too technical to communicate to a media that lacks the level of sophistication required to digest it. Much of bitcoin is like that.
I am happy to volunteer to help coordinate a formal response to bitcoin technical issues, so long as I can coordinate with other stake holders and thought leaders in the community.
And, oh yeah, I can code too.
@_date: 2014-07-13 13:15:20
I think this.  If you consider every single person who has invested in bitcoin to date, by going through the painful process of registering with shady looking exchanges and figuring out how to personally secure their own bitcoin, then there are probably 4 times that many people willing to just click 'buy' on an Etrade or Fidelity account.
More to the point, I think many of the people, like myself, who have already invested their 'liquid cash' into bitcoin are also sitting on a lot of funds in trading accounts, be it 401k or IRA, or something else, that they would love to shift some into bitcoin if they could.
So, yeah, not gray haired folks, but the same people who have already been investing in bitcoin to date would be able to shift additional funds into an investment they don't have access to currently.

According to the current rules, miners have to pay taxes on all of those bitcoins they mined.  If they want to comply, then they will have to sell a bunch of bitcoins to do so.  That creates sell pressure.
The fact that the rules state that you have to track gains and losses for every single transaction, even a cup of coffee, makes bitcoin effectively useless as a currency. 
Most of the perceived value in bitcoin is in the hope that it will become a viable currency some day.
While the IRS ruling sounds like a sweet deal for long term investors, it's a kick in the balls to the miners and throws into question if it can actually be used as a form of currency to buy and sell things.
Remember all those items we bought on Overstock.com and TigerDirect?  Or how about that Bee's Brothers honey?
Do you have a record of every single one of those transactions, the cost basis of the bitcoin you used, and your realized gain or loss every time?
Because, if you don't, and you don't file it on your taxes, then you are technically a tax evader subject to fines, penalty, or even prison.
As ridiculous as this sounds, it is the reality of the situation today.
I will be the first to publicly admit that I did not track my profit/loss every time I used bitcoin as a currency.  
Until this is clarified, this is huge problem for bitcoin in the US.  
The other problem, is that it is not as simple as just picking a threshold where this rule applies or not.  The IRS likes to keep things vague on purpose.
You owe the same capital gains taxes whether you bought a cup of coffee with bitcoin or a Ferrari.  If they pick some  threshold amount, people will take advantage of it so, instead, they don't state any threshold at all.
Personally, I keep my 'investment' bitcoin separate from my 'spending' bitcoin.  I have never made a large purchase with bitcoin, all small items under $100, and I'm going to live with that.

So, for me, my main reason is so that I can buy something online without giving out any of my personal financial information.  This is a *very* big deal to me.  I have had my credit card number stolen no less than three times in the past few years and every time it has been a big pain in the ass and it feels like a major violation; almost like being robbed.  That last time it happened, somebody ran around Las Vegas ****using my good name**** to have a great time and spend thousands of dollars.
Even though I was not financially liable, it was still a pain in the ass and it felt like a violation.
Credit cards are simply broken due to the lack of security features.
So, that's probably my main practical reason.  The rest of my reasons are philosophical.  Pretty much every time I have ever used bitcoin to buy things I am using bitcoin which has appreciated substantially over what it was worth when I originally acquired it at.  That's a way bigger reward than some 'cash back' or 'airline miles'.  In fact, I find it somewhat ironic that you say one of the benefits of using a credit card is that you receive virtual currency in return (airline miles, etc. are simply another kind of digital currency).
So, there you go.  Security and I get to use an appreciated asset to buy things.  It's fast, easy to use, convenient, and secure.
Now that Overstock.com accepts bitcoin I plan to do 100% of my online shopping there until Amazon.com begins accepting bitcoin.
I get the sense that your post is a little bit of a troll but the simple fact of the matter is that until the credit card companies fix their horrific security flaws, I will not be using them any more for online purchases.  And let's not even get started on credit card companies vampiric interest charges and penalties.  That's a whole other topic.

No, the US does not have a chip or a PIN. It's absurd. Yes, I was reimbursed each time but it still feels like a violation.

It is not a bad thing.  It is a good thing.  However, a short term correction in the price is expected as the people bidding on the coins at auction want to get as low of a price as they can so they will try to reflect that in the market price.
Once it shakes out everyone will be quite pleased that the coins are out of control of the feds hands and back on the open market.  Once finished the price will stabilize and return back on its normal trajectory to the moon.
What will be fun is to see at what price point people think the market coins are a bargain and start snarfing them up.  Sadly I don't have a lot of fiat left to buy any more right now.

In the US almost every state and local government charges nearly 10% in sales tax. This is computed and filed automatically at physical retailers. 
However, currently, most online sales are exempt from this requirement; instead putting the burden of self reporting on the consumer.
This allows major online retailers to get a nearly 10% price reduction over physical retailers, giving them 
an unfair advantage.
Currently there is a lot of discussion in the US to change this situation and force online retailers to collect sales tax.
The point being that, like bitcoin, there was an overly burdensome and impractical requirement for the consumer to self report and collect taxes that nearly 100% of people ignored. Now the government is changing the rules to make the process more automatic and reasonable.
I think the comparison is accurate.

They have to file an amendment.  Does anyone on this subreddit pay taxes?  None of this is new, the rules already existed, the IRS did not make up some new rules for bitcoin.  They just decided to treat it like stock.  Anyone who thought they were going to get rich off of bitcoin without having to pay taxes wasn't thinking too clearly.
The fact that you *can* evade taxes doesn't mean you aren't still obligated to pay them.  The IRS is not very friendly and is backed up by lots of men with guns and prisons.  Ask Wesley Snipes how that not paying taxes thing is working out for him..

It will never be completely non-profitable.  It's a self-regulating system.  People are often under the false assumption that the bitcoin network needs these massive computer systems to run.
It does not.  There is no difference if we had 10,000 low end PC's doing hashes on the CPU or a million running ASIC's.  Either way, transactions will get processed just fine and the difficulty will adjust accordingly.

I don't think any of my Freemason brothers give a shit what my belief in God is.  One of our main rules is that there is no discussion of religion allowed, which pretty much keeps that sort of thing in check.  I'm comfortable with my definition of God and that's all that matters to me.

Here is a link to the top 150,000 bitcoin addresses sorted by their age:
Here is a link to the top 150,000 bitcoin addresses sorted by their balance:
Here is a link to some blockchain summary statistics over time by month:
Here is what it contains.  It has a list of the top 150,000 bitcoin addresses by value.
For each address it lists the following:
*Days since this address was used for a spend output.
*The current value at this address.
*The first time this address was ever used.
*The Last time bitcoins were sent to this address.
*The last time bitcoins were spent from this address (if ever)
*The total number of bitcoins spent from this address.
*The total number of bitcoins received to this address.
*The total number of transactions on this address.
*The public-key of the address.
This data is output twice, first sorted by balance and second sorted by age.
Obviously it's a large file, but you can import into a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel and sort and graph it however you wish.
If you create some interesting graphs out of the data, I would certainly be interested in looking at it myself.

Bitcoin has a fixed mathematical distribution which is public knowledge, mathematically based, cryptographically secured, and agreed upon through consensus by the community.
If the USD had the same properties I would be all for it.
However, instead, it is created at will by private bankers with no oversight by the public or the government and is a for profit venture for a secret cabal of banks.
Currency now has competition.

Sorry, they are not being moved to new addresses.  They are moving forward in time.  When I finish this visualization it will be much more obvious.  I am going to change these from boxes to bricks, on each brick it will display either the exact bitcoin balance *or* the first 8 digits of the public key address.
When a new address is created it will animate in (grow from a tiny dot to full size). When an old address is removed, it will shrink away.
However, when an existing address moves forward in time it will animate forward instead of just 'popping' like it's doing in this version.

The network is still limited at about 6/7 transactions per second. That's fixed based on the block time and block size. They could increase the block size but that would make the blockchain start growing even more wildly than it already is.
If more than 7 transactions per second were submitted on a continuous basis with no letup then transactions would just end up getting dropped.

I find it interesting that people use my data to draw completely different conclusions.  The bitcoin network is both a way to store as well as transfer value. Every time I analyze the data it appears to be successfully serving that purpose.
At this early stage I'm not sure how much I care whether that transfer of value is from gambling, drugs, commerce, remittance or speculation. 
I am simply amazed that the network is still up and running and no governments have successfully shut it down.
A peer-to-peer value transfer system is fundamentally a useful thing. If it takes ten more years for it to grow in acceptance and  accommodate a place in more traditional commerce, well I'm patient.
For myself personally I use it both as a store of value and as much internet based commerce as possible.
I'm happy if just a bunch of libertarians want to use it for our own political reasons for the next ten years. At least I'm not using a credit card, I am not giving out my personal information, and I am not having to go through a bank.

I suppose my thought was not to turn it all into bitcoin and leave it there but rather turn it all into bitcoin when the ETF launches and then cash much of it back into less risky investments after the initial run-up.  While there is still long term risk in bitcoin, I think the risk of the price of bitcoin dropping immediately after the ETF launches is somewhere approaching zero.

More to the point. I don't measure the success or failure of bitcoin based on daily market price.
I measure the success on the mere fact that the network continues to function and has remained largely unmolested by the state.

Just a brief follow up.  I spent about 4 hours this morning finishing the article which accompanies this image.
The article now documents how to find the public key for an output in a transaction.  It talks about hashes, associative containers, and how to build the block-chain taking orphan blocks into account.  Finally it discusses how to compute the transaction hash, process all transactions, inputs, outputs, and associate them with public key addresses.
I'm sure there are typos and errors and, as others have pointed out, this information has already been made available by others elsewhere.
However, I am of the opinion that there is value in additional documentation about the blockchain for the bitcoin community.
I 'only' got 28 downvotes for this.  I'm not sure why I get downvotes for providing documentation, for free, to the bitcoin community, but, whatever. To those of you who upvoted, and the two people who sent me a bitcoin tip, thanks.

Well, here's the problem as I see it.  Nice libertarian philosophy says that people should be free to buy and sell drugs and that providing a safer market for this activity is actually a good thing for society.
I can buy that argument.
What I cannot buy is the argument that says that hiring contract killers, paying people for other forms of violence, and child pornography are victim-less crimes.

Question  : Changed the world with this, spawned a new way of spending with this block, from this person to this person.
"What are 285 bytes, block 170, and from Satoshi to Hal Finney?"
'Changed the world' is a reference to a famous blog post titled '285 Bytes That Changed the World' which describes the genesis block of the bitcoin blockchain in extreme detail.  You can read it here: 
Block 170 is the famous block in the bitcoin blockchain which represented the first time any one person ever sent bitcoin to another person.  In this case it was the creator of bitcoin, Satoshi, who sent it to famous cryptography expert Hal Finney

He's definitely pretty trolly. He puts a negative spin on everything.
His most obvious bias comes from when he tries to classify 'legitimate' use of the network or otherwise describe some use as 'good' or 'bad'.
Bitcoin is a value transfer network. It is agnostic about the purpose of those transactions.
So long as the network survives and continues to allow significant value transfer to occur it is a success.

So, Tim seems to be acting as the eternal bitcoin gadfly around here and he might be wearing out his welcome if he keeps this up.
I have communicated with him quite a bit and shared a lot of data.  I have also given him the advice that while constructive criticism of the bitcoin ecosystem is useful it is best to temper it with a sense of balance and optimism as well.
At this point he is beginning to sound more like a generic bitcoin 'hater' because he sees only problems and no solutions and, apparently, nothing positive about bitcoin.
This becomes especially clear whenever he starts talking about 'legitimate' uses of bitcoin and 'legitimate' owners.  He tries to pass value judgments about how people choose to participate in a nascent economy.
A particular point I would like to raise is regarding the graph he includes which I generated.  Here we are both looking at the same data but we have two entirely different perspectives on it.
I see a healthy and vibrant burgeoning economy and he sees something which is pathological and destined for failure.
The analogy between bitcoin and gold is a good one and cannot be over-used in my opinion.  Today there are over a trillion dollars of gold being held by people as a store of value.  They cannot use that gold to buy things online at Overstock or Tiger Direct.  In fact its actual utility in real world commerce is really quite limited.
Meanwhile, people hold bitcoin as a store of value while, at the same time, using it for legitimate commerce.  Tim cites the 10%-15% liquidity as if it were something bad, while I see it as a really positive sign.  If 10%-15% of all gold reserves in the world changed hands every couple of months in commerce, I'm sure all of the gold bugs in the world would treat that as a sign of success.
One of the main elements of my graph are all of the bitcoins which are held in old addresses.  He, and many others, seem to assume that these coins represent some sort of existential threat to the bitcoin economy, and, maybe they do.  However, I have a different way of looking it.
I strongly suspect that the vast majority of those bitcoins associated with addresses 3 years old or longer, are irrevocably dead and will most likely never re-enter the economy.  Of course we have no way of knowing this with absolute certainty.  Maybe Satoshi is sitting on every private key to every bitcoin block he ever mined and has some deep and mysterious purpose planned for them.
Maybe, in addition to Satoshi, other early miners or investors hold their private keys, never once transferring them to a new more secure address, and plan to shake the bitcoin world to its knees at some unknown point in the future.
However, seriously, I really, really doubt it.  We have seen a trend over time of really old coins coming out of retirement and re-entering the economy, and, we have seen *the rate of this activity taper off over time!*  As time goes on the frequency with which large numbers of really old coins move is ever diminishing.  This, of course, makes perfect sense.
If you had bitcoins in a really, really, old address, you would be highly incentivized to at least move them to a more secure wallet at some point even if you were not intending on selling or spending them.  You would want to test the key to make sure that your wallet was not corrupted.   Bitcoin wallet security has advanced tremendously over these past couple of years and I am amazed by people who would leave millions of dollars worth of bitcoin untouched in a very ancient wallet without at least doing some kind of a 'test send' or otherwise move them to more secure storage.  I have, just myself, moved my bitcoins multiples times as I have learned more about bitcoin security.  First I stored them on an encrypted digital wallet, then I moved them to a paper wallet and, finally, to BIP38 encrypted paper storage.  If you haven't moved your bitcoins from their original mined address for over three years, not even so much as a one penny transaction, you must have an incredible amount of willpower is all I'm saying.  Or, more likely, they are long lost; thrown away on the trash heap as they were not worth anything at the time.
When I create that graph, I monitor 'age of last' use based on any send transaction, no matter how small.
So, if you at least entertain the idea that roughly 30% of all bitcoins ever mined are irrevocably lost and no longer a part of the active economy, all of the sudden many of the assumptions made about the vibrancy of the economy have to be re-adjusted.
Personally, I think an economy where 80% of all of the currency/commodity is held in reserve as 'savings' or a 'store of value' while the remaining 20% is used for active commerce, sounds like a very vibrant and healthy one.
I also don't need to make a bunch of value judgement about what corresponds to good or bad commerce.  Movement of value is what is important as far as I am concerned and so long as the network is serving that purpose, I'm calling that a win for the team.
Yes, there are many things to be critical about the bitcoin network.  However, every criticism should be countered with an optimistic view about how we can fix and improve upon it.  I'm still in this not as a get rich scheme but for the real political and social change that bitcoin can affect on the world.

So, to be sufficiently paranoid, here is what you could do as additional steps.
When you go to this website: 
Instead of just running the software there instead click on the link 'github repository' which will take you here:
Now click on 'Download Zip'
All this is doing is downloading to your computer the same exact software that you are running on their site.
Now copy this zip file to a USB stick and move it to some computer that has never been connected to the internet.  Unzip the file and run the HTML page 'bitaddress.org.html'
You are doing the same exact thing, but this time you are running the software locally on your machine and not connected to the Internet.  If it is actually a computer that has never been connected to the Internet before then you have reached a sufficient level of paranoia that you can feel completely safe.  The bitcoin community has vetted this bitaddress.org software and i
When you are connected to the Internet to generate your keys there is some very small off chance that some piece of malware exists on your computer that is somewhere, somehow, 'watching' what you are doing at the time.
You can reach a level of paranoia that is truly overkill at some point.  On the other hand I have heard horror stories too.
I think the main point is that when you send your bitcoins to the paper wallet, do it in smaller increments.  You want to avoid a 'single point of failure' as a general rule.
All this said, compare this to things like Coinbase and BlockChain.info which are only ever accessed via the internet and always susceptible to Malware attacks, so you are certainly significantly reducing that risk by running the paper wallet generator offline on a separate machine not connected to the internet.

Bitcoin has a ton of problems. The number of transactions per second is way too low, the confirmation time is too long, and the proof of work is a massive waste of energy. People always say these things can be 'fixed' but that is easier said than done. Any changes to solve these problems would present risk and be met with resistance.
Of course they could all be solved by a new alt-coin.
As a bitcoin investor myself I'm rooting for things like sidechains which solve these problems by piggybacking off of the core bitcoin blockchain.
I can easily envision a future where the idea of using the blockchain to send a single 5 cent transaction is as ridiculous as spending a million dollars for a stamp.

I wrote about this a year ago. for what its worth none of this should be news.
There have been numerous posts here about it. The tax law has always been clear on this topic, none of this is new.
I have carefully tracked every time I have converted to fiat and back but, realistically, tracking purchases is impractical.
When/if the price of bitcoin ever stabilizes this will be less of an issue.
All you can do for now is do your best. If you really feel like you made and realized some gains then make your best effort to file it.
No one should be surprised they were going to have to pay taxes on their profits.
I have been very careful to never cash out a penny more than I have put in so, to date, I have realized no gains.

I have invested a lot into it personally, therefore I am not betting against it and, yes, I believe it has a good chance to stay.

Did you exclude all bitcoin addresses with a balance of less than .1btc?
Also, you do realize, it is impossible to correlate addresses to people right?
Your "analysis" is meaningless because there is no way to know which addresses belong to individual people or large exchanges or other businesses. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 13:38:23
Well, consider this. Over 1/3 of all bitcoins reside in addresses which have been untouched for well over a year. So, think about that. Over 33% of all bitcoins are controlled by people who are not involved in this simply to get rich quick.  They are already millionaires, some maybe even billionaires on paper, but they have resisted the urge to cash out. What are the holding on for? I would argue most likely on principle for the day when the need to 'cash out' no longer matters.
Many people involved in the bitcoin movement are in it for deeply philosophical reasons.  I certainly am. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:56:33
This cannot be repeated often enough.  If you own an Android phone then run, don't walk, and download and install the Mycelium wallet.  Immediately backup the keys and store them safely.  If you ever lose your cell phone, it won't matter, you can easily restore your funds from your backup keys.
Second, only use your cell phone wallet for a relatively small amount of walking around money, whatever that means to you, but certainly not thousands and thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin.
For thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin, store them on a BIP38 paper wallet.  This is bitcoins stored at an address printed on a sheet of paper.  The address is encrypted and you could give a copy of that sheet of paper to anyone in the world and they still couldn't touch your funds unless they held a gun to your head and made you give up the password.
Also, while not required, I recommend that you don't store all of your offline bitcoins in a single address.  For example, let's say you have 100 bitcoins.  I would recommend, quite literally, creating 100 bip38 paper wallets and storing one bitcoin apiece into each of them.
My reasoning behind this is two fold.  First, if you ever want to bring bitcoins out of cold storage, you can do it 'one bitcoin at a time' and, second, why have a single point of failure?  The worst case scenario if you do something monumentally stupid when you bring your bitcoins out of cold storage is you lose just one.

@_date: 2014-01-16 14:28:28
A big concern is that a change, any change no matter how small or seemingly innocuous, could cause a bug that might accidentally destroy the entire value invested in bitcoin.
Because this risk is real, and so very high, it means that there will be tremendous resistance to making hardly any changes to bitcoin. More likely changes will be done on alt-coins first and certain desirable features only back ported to the bitcoin code base once they have been thoroughly vetted in the real world.
Complex software experiences something like "the butterfly effect" where a tiny change can end up showing up completely elsewhere as an intended consequence.

I am not a professional quiz maker or anything, I just did this for fun.  It does show that you can make a neat game out of using BIP38 encoding. Now, all of you winners, please be sure to file this on your tax returns......  I will probably do another one of these soon.  If someone here thinks they are good at making up quiz questions, contact me by private message because that was the most difficult part.
To further education about BIP38 encoding of paper wallets, I am providing a fun trivia contest that people can play.  A lot of people got annoyed by my 'free lunch' post yesterday, so I'm trying to make up for it here. Also, someone randomly (I don't know who) sent me some bitcoins this morning, so I'm trying to spread the wealth.  Important note.  If you think this is fun and want to tip me, please do not.  Instead find one of the public key addresses to one of the questions which hasn't been answered yet and send a tip there instead to increase the prize pay out.
I have created 12 paper wallets in BIP38 encoding.  The pass-phrase for each wallet is the answer to a trivia question. 
The trivia questions are in the *Jeopardy* style format, meaning you must answer in the form of a question.
* Each pass phrase will begin with 'What is', 'Who is', and 'What are'
* Each pass phrase will end, and must include, a question mark
* Case sensitivity and punctuation are important.  For example, if the answer is a proper name, then the proper name will be capitalized.  If there is an initial, it will have a period.  If there is a list of items, it might have commas between them.
* Some of these are easy, some may be more difficult.
* Please let me know when you have claimed a prize.  You should 'sweep' the key to claim the 10 millibit reward.
* Once someone has claimed the funds I will update this post accordingly.
* I have confirmed that all of these keys are valid and the exact response will unlock the key.
* You can test a BIP38 password if you have a blockchain.info wallet, just use 'import private key' and paste the private key in.  If you have a Mycellium wallet, you can scan the private key QR code and then enter you guess. If you are doing this on a mobile device, it's quite slow and not a very good way to do it.  I'm sure there are other options as well.

Bitcoin may be regulated, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. And points/tokens are obviously interchangeable terms when it comes to digital artifacts. See there is another one for you 'digital artifact'.
Of course governments can attempt to regulate and control private money. It doesn't mean anyone has to like it.
They have the guns and the police and behave like a mafia deciding who gets to play, by what rules, and how much of a cut they get.
The reason bitcoin is going to be regulated, and not game currencies, is because bitcoins have value.
If any game currency achieves exchange value it too will be subject to regulations.
Why does bitcoin need to be regulated today but not in 2009? Why does bitcoin need to be regulated but not a fork of the code?
The difference isn't the technology, they are the same, the difference is that one has a market value and one does not.
And what is market value other than a shared belief?

People are legally required to pay sales tax on every single online purchase. How many people actually self report that on the billions and billions of online sales annually? Almost no one.

This article also ignores the fact that this particular ruling can, and probably will be, changed since it is unreasonable and impractical.

How do daily price fluctuations change the long term equation of the success, or failure, of bitcoin?
If bitcoin exists in five years time, is still legally accepted to buy goods and services online, and hasn't been made illegal by the state then *any* price today is a bargain.
That doesn't mean the long term investor doesn't want to buy more at a lower price.
There is no question that bitcoin is a long term risky bet but, if you intend to make that long term bet, then day to day price volatility is irrelevant.

Ok, here is a revised spreadsheet using your numbers of real dollar cost averaging would have produced if you invested once per week.
I used your exact numbers, meaning an investment of $13,900 over a 20 week period while bitcoin was in a 'bear' market with one investment each week of exactly $695.
The biggest difference is that using actual DCA you end up with almost 21 bitcoins instead of just 20.
Also, by using DCA on a weekly instead of a daily basis, you fail to hit a number of the lower price points.  It would be interesting to redo the spreadsheet with a daily instead of a weekly buy.  It would also be interesting to look at the spreadsheet if it went back to May of 2013. (EDIT: I just revised the spreadsheet doing a daily buy of $103.73 and while the percentages are about the same, you do end up with 21.3 bitcoins, and a slightly lower average)
The main point here is that if instead of doing a single buy-in at the high point, you spread your buys over time, you also get a better average price for your investment.
Personally, I buy over time but not at a fixed rate.  I tend to buy on dips, which is completely my own personal choice.
Once again, here is the revised spreadsheet, using your numbers, but actual DCA.
@_date: 2014-01-12 22:28:28
They are all wrong. This is well established under barter trade.
According to your logic the following is true.
I could buy a $100,000 car with bitcoins and owe no federal taxes.
But if I sell $100,000 worth of bitcoins to buy the car I *would* owe taxes.
Whether you get cash or a car, either way its a taxable gain event.
@_date: 2014-01-05 00:17:08
Here is what I did.  Once the price of bitcoin hit $1,000 apiece, I started getting nervous having all my eggs in one basket.  I have all of my bitcoins now stored in 1 bitcoin apiece sized addresses.  That way if I ever need to pull some out of cold storage, I can do it just $1,000 at a time.  It limits the risk of my making some stupid accidental mistake since I'm always operating with smaller units.  And, sticking all of your bitcoins in one address, even if it's technically safe, is still sitting out there on the block-chain as a big blinking neon light that says 'money here, money here..'
So far I have no regrets having done this and it's been a few months.

I didn't say there wasn't a use for bitcoin in underground markets, but as far as being able to use it for general online purchases, as an investment vehicle, as a way to send remittance around the world, all of these are points of attack that the governments, run by corporations threatened by these changes, can sink their teeth into.

I can't tell a big difference.  Even though supposedly coinbase charges fees and circle does not, the difference whenever I do make a buy seems pretty small.  Because I have been a verified customer on coinbase for a long time I can get a much larger instant purchase there than I can with circle.
TLDR: They both seem to work fine with no major differences.  Choose whichever you prefer.

So, let's discuss all of the portions of the transaction which *are* signed.  If you created a transaction hash from those parts, it would be immutable, correct?

There needs to be enough buyers to compensate for all of the sell activity happening relative to this 'good news'.  All of those donations to Wikipedia, all of those purchases on Dell, etc. those all immediately get converted to USD and end up as sell orders on the market.

You are completely missing the point here.  This is about averaging out the price of your highly risky investment.
At what point did I say that bitcoin isn't a risky investment and you could lose all of your money?
I never said such a thing.
What I'm saying is that if you are going to invest in this risky and highly volatile thing, then it's better to average your investment over a period of time rather than just one single buy-in at a peak.
Bitcoins are a risky investment.  You could lose all of your money.  
Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.
However..if you do plan to invest, then my recommendation is to invest over a longer period of time rather than one big buy at once.  You could get lucky and that one buy-in could happen to be at a low point, but that would be luck.

A lot of people seem to be missing the significance of this.  Bitcoin has always had a chicken and egg problem.  Yes, it offers much lower transaction costs, however, it would require all of the merchants to switch over their point of sale systems to support it and, other than a few rare exceptions, this has not been happening on any scale.
Meanwhile, since so few merchants accept bitcoin as payment, it has been stifling the growth of it as a currency leaving it to be little more than a purely speculative vehicle; which leads to price volatility.
Proponents of bitcoin generally have one key goal, which is to transition from government backed currencies and shift to an international and global currency which is backed by mathematics and a fixed and determined growth model, rather than ones backed by governments and guns and subject to the whims of central banks who can, and often do, print as much as they want.
So, how do we get to there from here?  Well, that gets us back to the chicken and the egg.
By using the existing debit/credit card transaction system as a *transitional* bridge we solve the first problem out of the gate.  Instantly bitcoins can be spent nearly everywhere globally.
Once this happens, then bitcoin can begin to evolve from being a purely speculative vehicle and instead grow as a powerful tool in global commerce.  This should reduce price volatility, and increase acceptance.
One of the things people don't seem to realize is that there is an immediate advantage here to the consumer.  We all know that credit card fraud and identity theft is rampant.
At first glance, you might think that a bitcoin backed debit card doesn't offer anything to solve that problem.  However, you would be missing a key feature of these systems.  Bitcoin allows you to have not just one account, but as many of them as you want with varying levels of security.  With a bitcoin backed debit card you are finally, truly, much closer to 'being your own bank'.
You do not have to store your bitcoins on these debit cards!!!  The bulk of your bitcoins are stored, securely, on your own wallets under you own control!
These debit cards can be 'hot loaded' on an as needed basis shortly before you make any purchase.  Even if your debit card were to be lost or stolen, the most they would have access to is your current pocket change, and nothing more!
Once more and more people begin shifting to using these bitcoin backed debit cards for payment, and as the bitcoin economy grows, eventually merchants will realize they can save a whole lot more money by accepting bitcoins in a more direct fashion.
Another feature these debit cards provide is accounting services with annual year end reports, suitable for filing taxes, removing most of the headache and concerns raised by the recent IRS rulings that consider bitcoins as a commodity subject to capital gains and losses.
These bitcoin backed debit cards, capable of being hot-loaded, are about creating a bridge that transitions us from the old payment system to the new, it allows bitcoin to grow as a useful currency, provide consumer protection, let consumers 'be their own bank', introduce bitcoin to a global marketplace, and lead to growth in value and price stability.
This is the key lever needed to transition the world off of government based debt backed currencies which are being printed at a breakneck speed and devalued by central banks, to the benefit of the wealthy and used to fund wars and oppress the poor.
This is how we get to 'there' from 'here'.

What I saw is 1,850 bitcoins moving right when the price of bitcoin was at an all time high.  That's over 1.8 million dollars worth of bitcoin being moved over a two day period which had, prior to that, remained untouched since the first few weeks of the blockchain history.  That sure looks like cashing some out.  And, if so, what is wrong with that?  I think any early bitcoin founder cashing out some coins or otherwise making use of them is great.  And, even if they were 'just moving them around' that is still a very significant activity since those coins were untouched since they were created.

I agree. Decentralized doesn't mean the community can't coordinate communications. What does a bitcoin foundation even exist for if not to communicate to the world at large? Maybe I missed the bitcoin foundation press release this week.

I'm pretty sure he owes the IRS at least a penny in capital gains on those socks he bought....

Well there are many who would not consider May 2013 (when I started buying bitcoin) being an 'early adopter'. I will reserve that title for people who bought in during 2010-2012.
I showed "infinite profit" because I sold enough bitcoin to recoup my original investment giving my remaining bitcoins a cost basis of zero. That was in November 2013.
But, since then, I have been slowly buying back in, *at current price levels*.
Anyone who is investing in bitcoin should be investing on a two to five year timeline with an expectation of a binary outcome.
Day to day variability is largely irrelevant beyond opportunities to dollar average lower.

Bitcoin debit cards.  People have not yet grasped just how mind-blowing this will be.  Suddenly you can spend bitcoin essentially anywhere in the world.  The debit cards will be able to be 'hot loaded', so you can use them for instantaneous world-wide remittance.
For example, my wife could be sitting in a restaurant in Europe and I can send bitcoin to her debit card from anywhere in the world and by the time the bill comes she can pay for the meal.

What is significant isn't the quantity of bitcoins moving but rather that they are moving at all. I have seen a steady pattern of about 200btc mined in the first few weeks moving every couple of months over the past year. I think that is interesting.
If they were mine I would move them *all* as soon as possible to a new more secure wallet.  The fact that these ancient coinbase transactions are moving piecemeal is really fascinating to me.

Let's say their software had a bug such that it didn't recognize a transaction properly and just automatically kept resending funds, well, in theory, that could have drained their funds due to their shitty accounting software.
However, this is highly doubtful.  Far more likely a criminal (this is a criminal website) stole all of the coins and used this 'bug' as an excuse for ripping all of his criminal customers off.

Yes this is normal. The same advice as always applies. (A) don't invest more than you are willing to lose completely and (B) have an investment horizon of at least a year. If bitcoin still exists in a year it will either be worth a lot more or virtually nothing.

Hot wallet on cell phone for spending. Everything else on cold-storage BIP38 encrypted paper wallets which have never been on the Internet.
Create one paper wallet per (unit) (it could be 0.1 btc or 1btc depending on what seems reasonable to you personally).  When you want to pull some money off of cold storage, then you can just move to your hot-wallet only the amount you need at the time.
The Mycellium wallet will let you directly import a BIP38 QR code, so it's one easy way to bring things from the cold to the hot-wallet.

You keep BTC all the time and it's only converted to USD right when you make a purchase.  So every time you run the card, right then and there, it's like 'selling' just exactly enough BTC to pay for that one item.
You keep BTC in your Xapo wallet however, and here is the single most important thing, you can hot-load your Xapo wallet!
So, here is how I plan to use it.
* Keep next to nothing in my Xapo hot-wallet/card.
* Right before I need to use the card, I whip out my cell phone and send just enough BTC from my personal wallet (which I control the private keys) to the Xapo hot-wallet/debit card.  
Example use case.  You sit down to dinner.  Send some money to the card to cover the meal and, by the time dinner is complete, it will have been confirmed and be ready to spend.
Better yet, send money to anyone in the world that they can spend on virtually anything.

I realize that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can survive every attack on them directly.
However..and this is the key point..they can prevent their mainstream use for financial services, remittance, exchanges, and business acceptance.
So, yeah, you can probably still by weed on the black-market with bitcoins in such a scenario, with a very, very, very, low valuation by the way, but if that's what happens then it has failed.

I don't understand why anyone leaves any amount of money on an unregulated exchange.  If you simply want to buy bitcoin and hold, then buy it and then move it to cold-storage.

I thought they were all dead but this data shows, in fact, that they are not.  This is rather significant.  Satoshi may not have been the only person mining block  however, the list of possible people who mined blocks between January 30, 2009 and February 7, 2009 is pretty damned small. And that person has been redeeming them at intervals over the past nine months.  This is, in my mind, significant, because if Satoshi controls the private key to one of the early blocks and is willing to use it, it's safe to assume that he controls *all* of the private keys to most of the early blocks and is quite willing to use them as he sees fit.

As someone who has worked in the video game industry for 30 years I can assure you that bitcoins are just like digital tokens in a game.
Listen to Richard Garriot, a pioneer in the game industry, talk about this when he was interviewed on LTB.
For the first couple of years bitcoins had no value, and were treated just like meaningless points in a video game.
Today, just like people wish to accumulate game currency and items, people are accumulating bitcoin tokens.
If, tomorrow, I fork an *exact* copy of the bitcoin code those tokens will be unregulated and have no value.
The point of my post is that governments are not regulating bitcoin, they are regulating belief.
I'm not saying that I am surprised by that but as someone who values freedom it still tastes bad.

Not everyone is a programmer who knows how to build the source themselves.  I just made one available if you want to play with it.  The executable package includes the first 128mb of the bitocoin blockchain, so you can experiment with it even if you don't have the entire blockchain on your machine.  Does require a 64bit machine and one with a lot of memory if you want to access all of the features.

I think that if you are willing to lose $22k on a chance to make a large return then, sure, go ahead.  Just realize you could lose every penny of it.
Bitcoin is still a very risky investment.
The obvious risks are:
* Something bad could happen with the software destroying all of the value.  It could be a bug of some kind or anything else which causes people to lose confidence in the blockchain as a store of value.  The blockchain could get corrupted, forked, attacked, any number of things could happen.
* Bitcoin is supplanted by something better which people switch to; the old 'MySpace' theory.
* Various governments pass regulations that frighten off enough investors that it loses most of its value. Related to this, governments could pass regulations destroying the 'fungibility' of bitcoin making them worthless. Or they could start filing tax evasion charges against a lot of people and frighten them away.  There are just so many ways that governments can create FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) that it could scare off people and cause businesses to stop accepting it.
I think these are the three big risks and no one can be sure what the chances are that one, or a combination, of these three could occur.
I believe that there is still every possibility that the value of bitcoin could collapse.
If none of these three dire predictions happen then, over time, as people grow in confidence of bitcoin as a store of value, then the upside is indeed still pretty huge.
This is a gamble, imagine you were placing a bet in Vegas on a hand of blackjack.  At this time you really have to think of it in those terms.
Also realize that bitcoin is a long-term binary bet.  You are placing a bet that will either pay off huge (&gt;100% return) or go to zero over the course of several years.
If you do make the bet, remember that, and don't freak out about intermediate volatility.
*EDIT * Oh yeah, I left off my most important advice.  Short of putting a bunch of money at risk as an 'investment' I strongly encourage anyone and everyone to buy $20-$100 worth of bitcoin, stick it on their cellphone wallet app, and spend it everywhere possible!  The risk is negligible and participating in the burgeoning bitcoin economy is an awful lot of fun!

You are saying that is is a valid use case for someone to submit a transaction and then, while it is in flight, someone else can modify it, and submit a modified version of the transaction?

I would argue that anyone owning less than that isn't being an active participant in the economy. You can change that cutoff to $10 instead, it doesn't change the numbers much.
I agree with the article that likely not much over 200,000 people own any appreciable amount of bitcoin.
Of those it is very dangerous to try to associate specific addresses with a specific population since many people control multiple addresses while many larger addresses represent cold storage for exchanges; or lost funds, or confiscated money by the feds.
We really don't or cannot know.
I am not saying there isn't wealth disparity, what I'm saying is that you have to exclude dust/noise, know your upper bounds (which this article discusses), and don't draw hard conclusions about the population because you simply cannot know for sure.

My rationale for picking January 2013 is because the price of bitcoin has risen astronomically since then; which to me means you would have to have a lot of willpower to have never done a single spend (and that's my criteria for non zombie status a *single*  spend no matter how small) or not to have simply moved the bitcoins to a more secure address.
If I change the zombie criteria to much earlier it really doesn't change much since the bulk of the zombie coins are all those 50btc mined blocks that never moved.

It seems clear to me now that the future of bitcoin, if it is even going to have a future, is as a digital fort-knox, where large sums of value are tied up and move infrequently, while the bulk of transactions will have to take place off-chain.  The real problem is we have no good solutions for this now.

BTW witcoins, are you being intentionally dumb when addressing me at a personal level?
I bought a bunch of bitcoins in 2013 at a relatively low cost basis. I spent a total of $16,500. When the price of bitcoin skyrocketed late in the year I sold *some* bitcoins (not all) to recoup my original investment and bring my cost basis to zero.
Since then I went ahead and bought some more, increasing the total number of bitcoins I own, but still keeping my cost basis very low relative to the current price level.
The fact that I took the money I cashed out to pay towards a car was just a personal anecdote that I shared because you were being such an asshole online. I still have the car and enjoy it very much. I would have bought it whether I cashed out any bitcoins or not, it really isn't particularly relevant to my profit/loss statement. I could have bought cans of spam really, it's beside the point.
The fact is that, today, I still hold a lot of bitcoins at a very low cost basis relative to the current valuation. If they go to zero, it won't be that big of a deal to me because my bitcoin "investment" represents only a couple of
percent of my overall portfolio.
Now, here I am sharing all kinds of information with you but still you intentionally misrepresent the situation.
You know my name. My personal history. My profession. My employer and a great deal about me. That is ok. That ship has sailed. I decided 30 years ago I was not going to hide behind a pseudonym online.

So, while I was focused on the topic of BIP38 wallets, and I'm not actually a big fan of "brain wallets" for security reasons, you could actually design a better "game" using a sequence of linked  brainteasers to follow a chain of clues through the blockchain. I will try to devise one of those games in the future. This would be a good way to create a much more complex branching game.
One answer could take you down one path of keys in the blockchain while a different set of answers could take you down another.
Heck, maybe I could encode the beginning of Zork in the blockchain that way. I should give it a try.
If there are any other closet game designers out there I've thrown it out as a challenge. Design a game where people have to answer a series of riddles to traverse a path through the blockchain. Each answer will lead to the next branch in the blockchain. You can leave small monetary rewards for the first people who solve the adventure.  Though, one challenge is avoiding people using the blockchain itself to avoid leaking clues to to your clues.  That's in interesting dilemma to have to deal with...
Yeah, definitely brain wallets work better for creating a true branching game.
Just to get things started I seeded a couple of clues starting here.  You should actually be able to follow them all simply by using the blockchain transaction history since I didn't create a new address for each transaction.
This is just a demonstration to give you the idea of how someone might create a branching game in the blockchain using brainwallets.

Two different topics. I think shaky and criminal exchanges create volatility and make it harder to determine a stable price.
The second topic is bitcoin related startups investing in infrastructure.
Bitcoin is a value transmission protocol. Today it can handle a certain amount of value transmission which is tightly bound to the price of bitcoin.
For it to accommodate more value to serve a broader market then the price must increase accordingly due to the fixed and limited quantity of bitcoins in circulation.
That's basic math and what most find appealing.

So, first of all, your bitcoins at coinbase are probably about as safe as your USD in PayPal; assuming you have enabled two factor authentication.
That said, we live in an era where people get their computers hacked and infected all of the time.  People with coinbase accounts have lost bitcoins because of this.
For example, you might click on a link, go to your coinbase account, enter your credentials and even two-factor authorization and, while you are doing this, a virus on your machine could snarf your credentials and steal your coins out from beneath you immediately, with no recourse.   I have heard stories of things like this happening.  The same thing could happen with PayPal, or your banking website, etc.  The degree of risk is probably low, but certainly non-zero.  And, it really depends on how well your machine is protected from viruses, trojans, etc.
So...when dealing with matters of money, people are justifiably paranoid.
The beautiful thing about bitcoin, the absolutely, unbelievably beautiful thing, is that you can take 100% responsibility for your own funds.
It's not necessarily the easiest thing in the world I suppose, though personally I don't think learning how to use BIP38 wallets is really all that difficult.  Or you could buy a Trezor and learn how to use that.
If you are unwilling to learn how to secure your own private keys then, sure, go ahead and trust that coinbase nor your account will ever get hacked, and leave them there.
Or....learn how to use cold-storage and control the private keys yourself.
Personally I have bought and sold hundreds of bitcoins on Coinbase.  My bitcoins are never actually stored on Coinbase for more than a minute or two at any time.
I hope this advice helps.

What don't you understand?  It shows the percentage distribution of all bitcoins based on their 'age' over time (age being defined as how long since a spend transaction was performed relative to a public key).

You cannot yet today invest in bitcoins using your 401k, Etrade, or any other mainstream investment vehicle.  You cannot use bitcoins to buy goods and services at hardly any places.
Anyone making a 'bet' on bitcoin is making that risky bet on the hopes that, some day, it will be a mainstream store of value and method of payment.

Proof-of-work in a future where bitcoins are worth an enormous amount of money would likely lead to a obscene waste of energy.  This paper points out the obvious, once you think about it for a minute, that people will always be willing to pay nearly as much in energy costs as a bitcoin is worth to mine it.
As of today bitcoin mining probably uses about one gigawatt of electricity continuously, or equal to about one half the power output by the Hoover Dam.
A $40,000 bitcoin would cause miners to use easily 100 times as much energy.  
It would be gratifying if the 'proof-of-work' served some other purpose than simply pure busy-work.  Maybe it could do something useful, like also encrypt communications or in some other way service a greater good.
Contrary to what a lot of people might assume, bitcoin mining has almost nothing to do with transaction processing (note the number of mined blocks with zero transactions).  All of the daily transaction volume of the entire bitcoin network could be easily handled by a handful of laptop computers.  The mining effort is truly all just wasted 'busy' work to prove that you did some calculations which, in turn, just waste electricity.

I like the spreadsheet but I'm not sure I agree with your rhetoric. So using this strategy, versus just doing a single buy at the peak, the individual's average cost basis would be much lower. 
Which is really the only point I was trying to make. I am not saying that bitcoin isn't a risky investment and you could lose every penny.  I am merely saying that if you are going to invest then spread it out over time in such a volatile market.
I would much rather have a cost basis of $695 than $1,000.
Also, just out of curiosity, why not redo that spreadsheet but go back to May of 2013 when I started investing and see what the cost basis would be. I'm guessing it would be about $200 per.

I did the same calculation today. You have to ignore this whole distraction of hashrate and simply focus on price.
In general rational people will not mine Bitcoins at a loss. That works out to about 1/4 of a Hoover dam.
That said, I suspect a whole lot of people are mining at a loss, often because they are either stealing or ignoring the electricity cost.
It is probably more like one half a Hoover Dam; about one gigawatt.
The real problem is what if bitcoins someday are worth a great deal more money than they are today?
If a single bitcoin becomes worth $10,000 then I guarantee you that, on average, miners will spend nearly that much in energy cost to get it.
Now, all of the sudden, we are talking about many Hoover Dams.
One thing people don't seem to realize is that mining has almost nothing to do with processing the measly 7 transactions per second the Bitcoin network supports.
The current transaction volume of the worldwide bitcoin network could easily be handled by a few dozen laptop computers.
They don't call it "proof of work" for nothing. I think we should rename it to be "proof of busy work".
This is going to become a major impediment to the growth of bitcoin because the energy wasted by mining at a higher valuation is simply obscene.
This may doom bitcoin and mean we have to switch to a more energy efficient cryptocurrency that uses proof of stake instead.
This is common sense by the way. Imagine if a single bitcoin was worth one million dollars. Who wouldn't pay a $900,000 electric bill to mine just one?

Actually, yes and no.  Some, who are maybe focusing on contracts and such are primarily focused on the tech platform.

Because they are talking about moving single Satoshis worth of value around, something you cannot do on the main bitcoin network.  Also, they are talking about wanting to do massive numbers of transactions, also something the bitcoin network cannot do.
The current bitcoin network cannot be used, and likely never will be able to be used, for large scale microtransactions.  Something which allows you to do billions of transactions of tiny amounts of value will have to function on some kind of alt-chain or side-chain approach; the main bitcoin network cannot and probably never will be able to handle it directly.

I created an animation which shows the distribution of bitcoins based on the age of last transaction for every address, day by day, since the first day of bitcoin.
The link above only shows the past year.  I think what is interesting in the data is that you can see how strongly people have been 'holding' throughout the beginning of this year.
If you would like to look at the raw dataset yourself and create you own graphs and analysis, here is a link to a Google docs spreadsheet with the raw numbers.

What he says here is perfectly true. Bitcoin is the worlds most inefficient network. The current 100,000 transactions a day could easily be handled by a couple of low cost notebook computers. The proof-of-work aspect of bitcoin, which quite literally means 'useless busy work', is monumentally inefficient.
Now, imagine, what if a single bitcoin was worth $10,000/USD? In which case I guarantee the network will consume at least $10,000 worth of electricity to mine each coin.
So, yeah, gold mining is not environmentally better than bitcoin were bitcoin to be worth as much as gold.

It's a self regulating system.  If miners don't think they are making enough, then they will stop mining, which will then lower the difficulty and increase the reward to the remaining miners which, in turn, will cause more people to mine, blah, blah, blah.
It's all completely self regulating by the nature of the system. It self balances based on cost/reward that *volunteer* people contribute to the effort.

Nope, they immediately get snarfed into the system.  I know this because recently I sent some money to a friend of mine (I didn't know they were giving me a coinbase public key).  I looked at the transaction history in blockchain.info and I saw that the funds I sent him quickly were all depleted and included in a massive transaction with tons of inputs.
Yikes I thought.  Somebody hacked his account I thought!
So I called him and found out it was a coinbase public key and coinbase almost immediately swallowed up those funds and sent them elsewhere into the maw of their big machine.  He logged into his coinbase account and it still showed him that he had that much available (even though the funds were whisked off elsewhere.)  So, he is trusting the integrity of their internal accounting and database.  Something I personally wouldn't do.
In this case all was well and good, but it still gives me the willies leaving any funds with a 3rd party.
I buy all of my bitcoins with coinbase but I always (and I mean *always*) withdraw them immediately to a wallet I directly control.

So, its all just bits and bytes. The blockchain is just a database which gets stored on people's computers, though typically just people who run the core client, which not many people do anymore.
Anti-virus software scans files on the users machine for a specific sequence of bytes of data that match known computer virus code.
If a transaction in the bitcoin blockchain contains the exact identical stream of bytes which an antivirus program already treats as a known virus then the software will quarantine that file.
When sending a bitcoin transaction people have the ability to input arbitrary data.
Someone could embed data which exactly matches the bytestream of a known virus.
It is important to note that even though this sequence of bytes is in the blockchain database files on your computer it could never be executed.
This is merely a situation where the antivirus software is being "spoofed" to trigger a false positive in error.

If you have risked money in bitcoin that would hurt if you lost it *all* then you have risked too much.  I don't know how many times we can say this.  Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.
Bitcoin is a long term binary bet.  Treat it that way.
If you aren't a professional trader and don't have the stomach for day to day volatility then you should never have gotten in in the first place.
"Your entire life savings", is clearly too much!
Pick a number, whatever that number is for you, maybe it's $5,000.  This is the amount that if you lost it all, you could walk away and not be upset.  Now, wait 3-5 years and see where it's at.
If it's not already glaringly obvious, you wouldn't have lost a penny if you hadn't sold!  You should not get emotional about paper gains or losses.  You never lose any money unless you sell and realize that loss, something you did which was a rookie mistake and foolish.

It is a special unicorn because it acts as both a payment network and a store of value and has cash like properties.  All of these things combined folded into one make it a strange hybrid beast for which no existing laws easily map.
If there are going to be regulations, then let them be reasonable and rational and address bitcoin as it exists and operates, rather than making bizarre rulings like applying VAT to it or trying to associate individual personal identities to addresses.

This is completely untrue.  The press release wording is a bit awkward, because they are trying to promote Coinbase as well as send people who don't have any bitcoin to a site where they can get some.
However, the reality is that you can send bitcoin directly from any wallet.  I just bought a one year subscription using my cell phone and Mycelium wallet, directly scanning a standard QR code.
So, your entire title is simply false, though the wording of the press release is admittedly awkward.

I only use Bitcoin-QT for blockchain analysis. I never store any funds on it.  In fact I don't store any substantial funds on any online wallet of any kind.  I keep all of my bitcoins on cold-storage paper wallets.  That's why it amazes me that these ancient bitcoin-qt wallet owners have let their bitcoins just sit for all of this time.  I sure wouldn't leave bitcoins sitting for 5 years on an untested online wallet, I would put them on a sheet of paper and into a vault.
At any rate, my assumption that nobody who mined bitcoins in the early days still actively controlled their keys seems pretty wrong.  
When you do a burn down graph the bulk of the ancient bitcoins are still all untouched, but the fact that such very, very, early bitcoins are still active is definitely significant in my view.

I will just keep using bitcoin even though their value will drop.  The thing is, just because our government makes it illegal, it doesn't mean all governments will.  Bitcoin will always has some value in some places.  I think they are well on their way of not so much making it illegal but, rather, regulating it to the point that it becomes impotent.  They are just going to keep arresting enough people that no one will touch it with a ten foot pole.  We aren't that far away from that right now.
Soon enough the word from on high will be to not outright make it illegal but instead establish regulations which basically make it impossible to use bitcoin in its current form.

So, he is using my data. If I wrote this article it would be titled, "Incredible usage of the bitcoin network, 30% of all bitcoins move every few months!"
If 30% of all gold changed hands wouldn't that be remarkable?
To me this data is incredibly positive but the author never saw a bitcoin glass as anything but half empty.
**EDIT** 
I might add that this chart does not and cannot account for all of the off-blockchain transactions.  Maybe everyone doesn't know this but say you go to Overstock or TigerDirect or NewEgg or Dell and you go to buy something with bitcoin. When you get to the checkout and you have a coinbase account and it offers to the option to let you pay via your coinbase account (rather than just scanning a QR code), then that transaction never shows up on the blockchain.  That is just internal accounting at Coinbase.  Only if you scan a QR code and actually do a send from your personal wallet will it show up as a blockchain transaction.
Likewise, if you deposit money on an exchange and then, afterwards, start doing hundreds of trades.  None of those trades show up on the blockchain.  The only time exchange volume shows up on the blockchain is when people do a deposit or a withdrawal.
So, this article is clearly missing a massive amount of economic activity.  Some of those very large 'unmoved' blocks probably represent the cold storage for various exchanges.  Lots of money is moving on their internal databases, just not on the blockchain unless the cold-storage has to be cracked open.

I was referring to, quite literally, the total number of bitcoins which move on the network over time. Every few months 10-20% of all bitcoins in existence move. I can't say for sure why they moved, but they aren't dormant.
Also, this excludes all off blockchain activity such as happens on exchanges. Those we have no idea about.
For example an exchange could hold a huge number of customer bitcoins in cold storage. All of the trades which happen on that exchange would never show up on the blockchain directly. So that economic activity isn't even measured.

Sigh...so...Dorian has no public record as a cryptography expert.  All of his online written material doesn't even come anywhere near close to matching the precise well written content of the real Satoshi.  And, most importantly, the real Satoshi is notoriously careful about protecting his identity; so the idea that he would use his real name is simply absurd on the face of it.
There is no evidence in any way that this reporter, who spoke to Dorian for all of 30 seconds, did anything other than misscharacterize and misrepresent a man who doesn't speak English as his native tongue.
I have read another blog, and I don't have the link at the moment (and can't find it anymore because the web is spammed with Leah's crap), that targets a specific expert in cryptography who has a long track-record of published academic papers which match the Satoshi written material exactly in any every way 'forensically'.

Complete nonsense. The association between bitcoin public key addresses and  individual "people" cannot be determined. 23 million bitcoin addresses have a balance of zero because they were just used for intermediate transfer. 1.5 million or more contain "dust" and are chaff and should be excluded. Any public keys with a significant balance (a) show a more balanced overall value distribution and (b) *still* cannot be associated with individual people.
One person can control hundreds of public keys and a single public key could correspond to a business holding value for hundreds of people.
You *cannot* determine value distribution of individual persons by analyzing the blockchain and any "analysis" claiming to do so is completely and utterly flawed.

Out of curiosity, I asked a gold dealer what he would give me for it, and he said 10% less than spot price "because I gotta make some money off it".
Other than a zombie apocalypse, I'm not sure what good physical gold actually has.

To be fair, to support billions of transactions pretty much requires off-chain solutions, you could not realistically raise the block-size limit high enough to accommodate that level of daily transactions.
I strongly suspect that there is a solution in the works by these private companies, but they simply haven't announced it yet.  The bit question is will that private solution be open-source, decentralized, and protect anonymity?  If it does, then great, let us know about it.  If it doesn't, well, there are going to be some serious questions raised.

That's your choice.  I pay my taxes but if you want to evade them that's your business.  There are many cases where people are obligated to self-report their taxes (for example servers receiving tips). 
So, you ask 'who the hell', well I'm one person.  I have carefully kept track of every bitcoin I have ever bought or sold and it's value at the time in a spreadsheet.  So far I haven't made any money off of bitcoin, but when I do I will pay my capital gains on it.
That said, I keep bitcoin I buy to use as a currency separate from the bitcoins I have for 'investement'.  I do *not* track every time I buy something from TigerDirect or Overstock.
That seems more or less impossible to me.

Great post. So far 21 is off to a horrible PR disaster.
Here is my theory. They started out as a bitcoin ASIC mining company that drank the moon flavored koolaid; meaning their business plan assumed that the bitcoin price was going to explode.
Obviously, that didn't happen. So now they are 'pivoting' by trying to repackage their ASICs as a consumer product even though that makes no logical sense based on the excellent analysis in this article.
I would love nothing more than to see a machine to machine value transfer protocol based on the bitcoin network embedded in billions of devices.  However....the economics don't make sense and the bitcoin network doesn't even scale, so what is the point?
If they have a solution for the scaling problem then let's hear it. That should be the lead.

You are wrong.  This is code which changes the consensus rules for bitcoin at the protocol level.
If, today, a cartel of miners deployed **HACKED** clients which changed the blocksize limit, this would be **IMMEDIATELY** signaled to the world as a 51% attack.  It would be treated as a defcon level 1 event that would bring all forces of the community together to respond to this **ATTACK**.
With BU, if a cartel of miners 'signal' a different blocksize, that's *NOT AN ATTACK*, it's now the 'proper behavior of the protocol'.
It fundamentally changes from Nakamoto consensus (everyone runs by the exact sames rules and anyone who does't is deemed an attacker) to 'emergent consensus' where the rules are, fuck that, whatever I want them to be.
If you cannot understand the difference, dear lord help us.
This the most insane, risky, crazy thing ever proposed in the history of bitcoin and people are pointing hash-power at it!??

Actually I got interviewed by a reporter in the last couple of weeks and they asked a bunch of questions about how many bitcoins were 'zombies' and how many were active.  Since this is a continuously changing value it it difficult to just say it is 'this much' and 'that much' definitively.  I hope people don't have difficulty interpreting this graph but it really shows how many bitcoins are actively moving at any one time over time.
I sent the link to the reporter.  The article hasn't come out yet.  I'm concerned it might be overly negative but I was did the best I could during the interview.  I'm not the only person who was interviewed; I know they talked to Tim Swanson and he is a big bitcoin debunker.

Why am I here? I want bitcoin to succeed in the third world and service the unbanked. I want it to be a tool against predatory remittance fees and service fees for people around the world to simply spend their own money.
So far the only serious criticism levied against bitcoin is that it's volatile. Ok, fine, thanks. Playing blackjack is volatile too, and we warn people about the dangers of gambling.
But adults in a free country have the right to speculate however they wish. Volatility reduces with adoption, just leave bitcoin alone and let it compete in the fee market. It will succeed or fail on its merits.

I don't think you pay any fees.  The fees are eaten by the merchant, which is their choice.  They already pay fees for credit/debit cards and figure that into their price.
Over time, as the bitcoin economy grows and merchants realize they can get substantial savings by accepting bitcoin more directly, chances are they will do so.  However, by using the existing credit-card system we can bridge from the old economy to the new.  It might take 5-10 years, but there could be a time when bitcoin will be considered the world-wide reserve currency.  Until then, we have to piggy-back on the old government backed fiat currencies and legacy payment systems.  This is just a bridge.

Look, I want bitcoin to be widely adopted, but there seems to be some shady shit going on these days with both Lawsky and NASDAQ, and the NYSE, and most especially 21inc.
Since their stated business goal makes no logical or technical sense, I think it is fair to be skeptical.
Are they suggesting each one of their embedded chips will be a full validating node? Of course not. It will be a micro pool mining rig contributing to centralization and control of the network.
They state that individual devices will send Satoshi's and participate in large scale micro transactions.
But we know that is impossible on the bitcoin network!

You don't need to increase the on-chain blocksize to scale bitcion!
In fact, in the long run, a smaller blocksize than 1mb would likely be desirable.
The safest way to protect bitcoin against attacks by the state is to treat it like fort-knox.  It stores the value.  It protects the value.  It is so small, thin, lean, and mean, that the state cannot attack it because it can pop up anywhere, and everywhere, across the entire planet.
All other use cases should be shifted to secondary layers, each serving their own customer base, use-cases, features, and security requirements!


Nonsense.  Bi-directional payment channels and sidechains already exist.


Read up on drivetrains.


Not true.  That would only be the case if all channels were opened directly on the main blockchain.  The LN can inter-operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains at the same time.
This hulk-smash hammer approach to scaling the big-block proponents have is both naive and dangerous and, in the end, solves nothing.
The demand for cheap on-chain transactions is not linear.  It's is geometric!
You don't need 2mb blocks to serve the world. Nor 4mb.  Nor 8mb.  You would need blocksizes so large as to be insane.
So, that makes on-chain scaling to meet world-wide payment demand a non-starter.

I agree with you that the *current* cost of energy being expended by bitcoin mining could be argued as being efficient for the value provided.  Though a lot of people would probably debate even that point.
The issue is, what if bitcoin goes to the proverbial 'moon'?  If one bitcoin was worth say $40,000 then a $144 million dollars of electricity would be getting burned a day by mining operations.

I start by explaining that almost all of their money is already digital. People hardly carry cash around anymore and most of their 'money' is just entries in a banks computer system.
Then I explain that bitcoin is just numbers in a different computer system.
This is my super non-techy explanation that gets people over the hump of not understanding how it can be 'money'.
Of course any follow up questions can explain that bitcoin is money for the internet, and that you can send and receive it as easy as an email or text message.
I also can explain that it is a different currency than the USD and can rise and fall in value just like other foreign currencies do.
I can explain that instead of their money being held and controlled by a single bank computer, that with bitcoin money is maintained by a global network of tens of thousands of computers and are secured by mathematics.
This gets most of the main concepts across with no technical discussion.

Bitcoin will never scale due to blocksize increases; not anywhere near the order of magnitude necessary to accommodate billions of transactions.
The only way to truly support billions of transactions, but keep bitcion itself alive, is some kind of side-chain type system.
The 20mb limit is not meant to 'solve bitcoin's scaling problems'.  There is no solution for that directly on the blockchain.  Instead, it is meant to give us breathing room until the lightning-network and/or some other side-chain solution can be deployed and integrated throughout the ecosystem.
The 20mb limit gives us that breathing room and it is both a conservative and safe approach to get us there.

Is this a joke or something?
Core has done extensive testing and development on an upgrade that provides a near immediate doubling of on-chain transaction capacity.
It is being actively blocked by a portion of the community.
The core team has made incredible improvements which will lead to additional network layers allowing bitcoin to scale to service the needs of everyone in the world; through a combination of sidechains and networked bi-directional payment channels.
They have been diligent, careful, and great caretakers of a live network protecting over 19 billion dollars of value.
The market price is up over 5 fold in the last year or so  and destined to grow more.
Maybe you should talk to the people who are currently attempting to hijack the network with a 51% attack in the form of the most dangerous piece of software ever proposed.

I cannot fathom why people are paying premium prices for this psuedo-bitcoin-associated asset.  I put in a $6,000 buy order from my self-managed IRA with a bitcoin price of $250 (a slight premium).  I refuse to buy this, or any other bitcoin backed asset, above market prices.  It's clearly over-valued when an argument could easily be made that the price should actually be less, since this asset isn't nearly as useful or flexible as bitcoins you manage yourself.
It does, I suppose, show interest and demand for a publicly traded bitcoin backed asset; I just wish the Winklevoss twins would get their COIN out, which will have much more liquidity.

That would be true....if....we had a valid sidechain system in place today and fully integrated into all of the various wallet applications to make them useful.
For a successful side-chain type system to work, it would need to be completely invisible to the end user; meaning they wouldn't even be aware that transactions were taking place off of the main blockchain, everything would 'just work'.
We are probably at least a year away from something like this happening so, in the meantime, we need to increase the block size now.

No, you are right. I think the correct solution is something like the lightning network proposal. The problem is that it isn't available yet, and something like it won't be available in wide distribution for years.
That is why I support a one time block increase (size to be debated) to give us time to bring these technologies forward to solve the problem permanently.

Yeah, let's put 16 billion dollars at risk because some people are impatient that they can't do low-value, low-fee transactions, on the worlds most secure decentralized network to safely store and transfer wealth.
There are a 100 alt-coins out there which have lots of properties that bitcoin does not.  Nothing is stopping anyone from using them.  And, with the aid of Shape-Shift, lots of people are using them.
The prime-directive of bitcoin is to protect the goose that lays the golden eggs.
I can put up with high-fees and the inability to make low-value payments while layer-2 systems come online.  That's a fair trade-off if the network stays protected.
Also, you simply cannot scale bitcoin on-chain very much safely.  Maybe 4mb, sure, but that buys virtually nothing.  The only way to scale bitcoin to service the needs of everyone on the planet is through layer-2 systems.
Segwit offers a near doubling of on-chain scaling capacity right away as well as provides numerous improvements that will enable bitcoin to serve those needs for everyone.
This siren call of on-chain scaling is naive, simplistic, pointless, and unhelpful.

There is no way of knowing.  A single person could hold 100,000 bitcoins and store them in 100,000 separate addresses.  Single addresses which have a large balance could correspond not to a single person but, instead, a large business or exchange which aggregates the funds of many people.
In short, there is just no way to really know and those who perform analysis based on false assumptions trying to associate addresses with people are not helping.
A common mistake people make is pointing out that 26 million bitcoin addresses have a balance of less than one one thousandth of a single bitcoin; as if this were supposed to mean something.
The real number is that 25 million bitcoin addresses have a balance of *zero*, meaning they were simply used for intermediate transactions and are not associated with any active account. 
The remaining roughly 1.5 million addresses with a non-zero balance but just a fraction of a bitcoin are simply dust, and are not relevant or important to any kind of an analysis.
If you only look at the distribution of addresses where the balance is greater than say $100 worth of value, then the distribution is reasonably balanced at that point.
It is known that about 30% of the early bitcoins, presumably owned by Satoshi and other early miners, have never been touched.  These are probably the biggest concern as there is no way to know if these are lost forever or are waiting to rise from the dead.
Every single day people who have large balances 'cash out' on exchanges and, when they do, the distribution of bitcoins spreads out wider and wider among the community.
There is certainly some wealth imbalance, but it doesn't appear to be particularly extreme or a major concern.
Here is a graph of bitcoin balance distribution based on age of last use:
Here is a graph of bitcoin balance distribution by value.  It is important to note that you cannot draw *any* conclusions about 'how many people' this represents for the reasons cited above.  This is just a sense of how many coins people and businesses stuff into a particular public key.
For example, in my case, I own nearly a 100btc, but I store them in nearly a 100 separate public key addresses.  So, you would have no way of knowing that I own a 100btc, most people would think I'm 100 different people.  The opposite is true when a single large address represents the funds held by an exchange that could easily represent a hundred thousand separate people.

As the title says, it's an early first draft.  Sorry, maybe I shouldn't have uploaded it yet.
At any rate, every single box represents exactly *one* bitcoin address.  The boxes are to scale.  So an address that contains 64 bitcoins is a box having a volume of exactly 64 units.
The z-axis is time.  I haven't put the labels on it yet.  This has a one day resolution.  Every single row represents exactly one day.
So, all of those giant piles of boxes which don't move from years ago, are the infamous 'zombie' coins people have heard so much about.  Now you can actually see them to scale, right along side everyone elses coins.
I know I may have made this available prematurely.  I was just psyched to see this visualization working at all.

Each miner can choose to fill a block all of the way with transactions, or none at all.  What they cannot do is choose to create blocks larger than 1MB.
The only way I know of to create a soft-fork that allows for blocks larger than 1mb that is backwards compatible with older non-upgraded nodes, is the accounting trick of separating the witness data from the rest of the block using the rather clever trick that Segwit employs.  This turned out to be a fairly arcane way to sneak a blocksize increase as a soft-fork; with all credit due to for coming up with it, or so I have heard.
If you know of another trick to increase or otherwise dynamically change the blocksize limit in such a way that older non-upgraded nodes would not reject the blocks, that is news to me.
The last time the blocksize limit was changed, it was made lower, not larger, so older non-upgraded nodes would still consider the newer 1mb max blocks as valid.  You can't go the other direction as a soft-fork unless you resort to the segwit trick.


What makes it harder for the competition, is forcing them to accept massive blocks that could cut out some of the nodes in the world.  Nodes which cannot process massive blocks, due to limited bandwidth, CPU, and storage capacity would be booted out of the network.  Really, any pathological use case that might come up which could give one group of miners an advantage over another would likely be exploited.


Some are, some are not.  But certainly most nodes are not.


You say this so casually.  As if this would somehow be acceptable.  Virtually no one in the technical community thinks large geometric scaling should happen on-chain.  
If anyone wants to propose an increase to 2mb or 4mb blocks as an interim stop-gap solution until layer-2 networks are fully operational and available, that is a perfectly reasonable thing to propose.  It isn't 'crazy talk'.  And, really, that's what segwit offers.  However, this notion that we are going to let the hard-block size limit grow to any arbitrary size is completely absurd.  Yet another reason why BU is a non-starter of a proposal.


The fact that it takes a hard agreed upon consensus limit and turns into an 'emergent consensus' property.  This opens the system up to numerous avenues of attack.  It breaks Nakamoto consensus.  And, this has been pointed out repeatedly in this thread by others with well cited references.


Not that I'm aware of.  They certainly did not go through the BIP process as far as I have heard.

Yeah, so it's a shame you don't understand how dangerous BU is.  If you are in favor of a blocksize increase, then support a client that offers that.  That is **not** what BU offers.  
BU makes a key consensus metric dynamically adjustable. Because it can be adjusted dynamically, on the fly, this fundamentally changes the game theory of the network. If some small group of miners want to squeeze the blocksize limit down to a minuscule size, they now can and the rest of the network must honor it. If some small group of miners want to make the blocksize limit massive, so as to prevent lightweight nodes and miners from participating, they can do that as well.
These consensus rules, buy design, as supposed to be extremely difficult to change and were never intended to by on-the-fly dynamically adjusted.
This change makes it incredibly easy for a small cartel of miners to change the rules to their benefit or as an attack on their competitors.

Yes, if you are the kind of person willing to place a 100k bet on a single hand of blackjack, then yes, it is strongly recommended.
Seriously, only 'invest' (read that gamble) on bitcoin what you are willing to lose.
How much is that?  $100?  $1,000?  $10,000?  $100,000?
That's a personal decision.  Bitcoin is a fairly binary bet, it's either going to worth a lot more in a few years or, most likely, largely worthless.  Most of its valuation is based on the belief that it will become a major way to transfer money for goods and services in a few years.
There are a number of things which could prevent that from happening.
It would be a lengthy post to discuss all of the risks but, suffice it to say, there is a lot of risk.
My personal recommendation is that every single person on the planet with a cell phone should own between $10 to $100 worth of bitcoin.
That would serve two purposes.  First, that isn't enough money that most people's lives would be over if they lost it all and, second, if every person owned that much, well, bitcoin would have largely succeeded.

With BU, if a cartel of miners agree to make the blocksize smaller, much smaller, they can.  Why would they do that?  Not sure.  Why do we assume that all miners are altruistic?  With Nakamoto consensus they are forced to all play by the exact same rules without signalling to the entire world '51% attack'.  But, BU enables, at the protocol level, the ability for any group of miners to co-ordinate, at the human to human level, changes to the consensus metric for the own personal selfish short-term goals.  The bottom line is that opening up a consensus metric is ripe for abuse and it is not increasing security.  It's increasing risk.


I am not in favor of geometric on-scale scaling.  Period.  To my knowledge, virtually no one in the technical community is either.  Current thinking is that '4mb' is about as big as the blocksize should get 'safely'. Obviously that is a soft-number.
I don't need to cite every single piece of research on this topic. I'm sure you are familiar with it.  Obviously certain optimizations could be performed to make the 'real' number be somewhere between 1mb or 8mb, or somewhere on that order.
However, it cannot, nor should it ever be geometric.  For bitcoin to support on-chain transactions for every person on the planet, for every machine on the planet, for every microtransaction on the planet, is not a desirable or realistic goal.  Scale by 2x, 4x, 8x, maybe; but not by 20x, 50x, 100x, 1,000, that's off the table.
Especially when we already know that layer-2 systems can, will, and should solve all of these use cases.
Making such radical changes to a live network currently protecting (let me check....) **19 billion** dollars of value ( is madness.
I get that you believe all of this stuff can be done, and is safe to do.  I get that.  I'm not even going to try to talk you out of it.  But there is no way, period, that this would be acceptable to perform on the main live network!!
Do it on a sidechain or an alt-coin, but this kind of risky, what could it hurt, attitude is madness.
I personally hold a lot of value on the bitcoin network.  There is no way I would feel comfortable accepting something like these ideas with my money.
I get that you think this all fine and safe.  Satoshi said it 'would be able to grow'.  Gavin (incorrectly) said 'I tested 20mb, it's fine'.  Craig Wright says, no problem...
However, I disagree. So does Andreas Antonopolous.  The entire core development team.  Nick Szabo.
Maybe you are right.  Maybe we can have massive blocks.  And giant data centers.  And everything will all just work right.
But you are heavily in the minority.
If 'the other side' was pushing something like bitcoin classic, a simple 2 or 4mb HF bump, while I wouldn't agree with that either (I prefer segwit as a SF), it's not a dangerous proposal either; other than the fact that it's a HF.
BU is something else.  Highly dangerous.  Breaks existing consensus game theory. Opens up new avenues attacks.  Threatens the entire network with untested changes.
I mean I can go on and on here.  
I will agree that you *MIGHT* be right.  *MAYBE* it's safe to do all of that.  I doubt it, but maybe.  It sounds wildly risky and nothing anyone anywhere should be taking seriously, much less pointing hash-power at, today.
Do it on an alt-coin.  Do it on a sidechain.  Let it run for 5 years, safely protecting value immune from the state.  Then come back and talk to me about putting it on the mainchain.

But the bitcoin network only handles 7 transactions per second and there is no need to be hashing. Note, they won't be mining, they will be hashing for reasons I cannot yet understand.
Frankly, their current business model make no sense to me. And, further centralization of mining and tracking users devices, who needs that? And, on mobile, margins are so thin you aren't going to make a profit selling chip IP as they claim.
So far nothing about this makes sense. 
I agree with your point that building a direct machine to machine value transfer network is worthwhile, but I don't know what 21 is going to do about that on the existing bitcoin network which can handle almost no volume.

Even though I bought in at a much higher price than you did, I still got in early enough that even as the price drops near $200 I'm still ahead of the game.
It is a lot easier to be a holder, and calm about it, if you are still showing a paper profit. It is even easier if, during a previous run-up, you sold enough to get back your entire initial investment.
However, for anyone who got on board in the past year and a half, a pretty long time in bitcoin land, they are sitting on a loss, and I can completely understand how difficult that might be.
You can say, "only invest as much as you are willing to lose" as much as you want but even then, when you are looking at large paper losses and fears of losing it all, I can see how some people may be filled with anxiety and regret.
As far as I can tell absolutely nothing has changed in the fundamentals.
I assume that some people, with nothing to lose, are cashing out. I wouldn't be surprised if it was mostly criminals and hackers. Once they part with their coins and they move into the hands of people who actually believe in the technology, I imagine this phase will be past us.

Yes, of course.  The LN is awesome.  What isn't so awesome is when people exaggerate what all it is capable of doing.
* To avoid a hub-and-spoke model (meaning for it to be even slightly decentralized) every person will need to have active probably four channels or more.
* Users will need to collapse channels when they become unbalanced.  No one can perfectly predict and tie up all of the value they will need at any given time.
* Users will likely open and close channels much more frequently than once every six months.
* The LN works fantastically for low value high frequency transactions, but it has all kinds of issues transacting large amounts of value; meaning people are likely to use the LN for all of their 'cups of coffee' but do on-chain payments for anything of a much larger value.
They point of all of this is that it is a myth that the LN means users will never have to do any on-chain transactions.  This is simply not going to happen.  The LN will be capable of off-loading the vast majority of low-value transactions from the bitcoin network.  Which is fantastic!  And something we should all be very excited about. However, this notion that it reduces the need for any scaling or can handle 99.9999999999999999% of all transactions is absurd.

A company already does this. They are called Xapo. But they do not offer their product in the US. Imagine this scenario. Your loved one is any place in the world and needs money to buy something, anything. You send bitcoins to their bitcoin backed debit card and twenty minutes later they have access to the funds with no fee. In this scenario the merchant eats the fee. Which is stupid for them. Once more and more retailers realize the benefits of bitcoin they will cut the credit/debit card processor out of the middle and just use BitPay.

* I answered someone in another thread and my answers address most of your questions here.  Or, at least presents my argument with references. I'm sharing the same response here.


Because classic does not change the consensus rules of bitcoin.  It's still Nakamoto consensus.  If everyone agrees to a new blocksize limit, one known to be 'safe', then that's reasonable.  
Bitcoin classic also makes almost no changes to the existing bitcoin source code, so therefor it represents much less risk as well.
The primary risk of bitcoin classic, in my view, is that it's a controversial hard fork.  I don't think it's the worst ideal in the world but, all that said, segwit as a soft-fork which provides similar on-chain scaling relief immediately and also includes bug-fixes is by far my preference.


Wow, let me count the ways.  First things first.  BU is comprised of massive changes to the code base that were not performed according to the current peer-review and testing process.
We really don't need to discuss anything else.  That alone is completely disqualifying.  This is a live network protecting 19 billion dollars of value.  You don't treat it like your personal pet project where 'anything goes', with a 'what could it hurt' attitude.  The current bitcoin core development process is extremely rigorous.  
In addition to that.  BU changes the consensus mechanism for one of the most important key metrics (block-size).  This is a metric which does *not* just control 'how many transactions can you do'.  This metric also controls CPU utilization, bandwidth consumption, storage requirements, sync-time, orphan rate, and impacts every single blockchain analysis tool ever written, likely in a very negative way.
Currently, this metric is constrained because all of these other effects are significant.
 Nick Szabo's excellent article here:
And reference to the Cornell study:
With Nakamoto consensus all participants, miners, nodes, users, exchanges, tools, wallet providers, all agree on one set of rules.  Anyone who violates any of these rule is no longer consensus and is immediately identified by the network, and community as a whole, as an active **attacker**.
BU, instead, introduces a new (entirely untested) consensus model called 'emergent consensus'.  Now, if any group of actors contrives to adjust the blocksize limit, larger or smaller, **IT IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED AN ATTACK**!  What used to be considered a 51% attack which would have raised alarm bells from the entire community, is now considered 'a perfectly valid and allowed action at the protocol level'.
This what I refer to as simply insane.


Not in the way you think.  I don't think that bitcoin transaction capacity should be constrained.  I think that is highly undesirable.  However, I don't think the solution in any way, shape, or form, involves raising the on-chain blocksize limit.  I believe the solution for geometric scaling involves a series of layer-2 networks, each designed, focused, and targeted at specific use cases.
Segwit offers us immediate short-term on chain scaling as well as helps enable improvements which will accelerate layer-2 solutions.

This is kind of not helpful.  A lot of the demand is from people who have money tied up in retirement accounts that cannot easily get access to bitcoin.  Most people are stuck with a brokearage account they are locked into by their employer.
I'm a pretty sophisticated bitcoin user, I've been holding for 4 years.  I buy bitcoin directly all of the time and I even do some trading on an exchange.
Meanwhile, I have a huge amount of money tied up in brokerage accounts as part of my retirement portfolio that I would dearly love to gain access to bitcoin exposure.  I cannot change the brokerage as it's part of my 401k plan with my current employer.
Also, quite frankly, the average investor trusts their brokerage much more than they would some scary wire transfers to exchanges around the world, all of which they have heard nothing but bad things about over the years.

Every single day thousands of brand new addresses are created which, at the end of the day, contain only dust. As well, 70,000 brand new, never existed before, addresses are created, receive some value and, at the end of the day, are emptied to zero. Over 50% of all new addresses on the blockchain are emptied by days end. This suggests that the transactions performed against those addresses, for that day, were intermediate/throwaway.
Overall the address space of the blockchain contains 97% dust.
My analysis has been focusing on the state of all addresses in the blockchain on a daily basis.  
Individual transactions don't tell the whole story, you have to look at where value started and where it ends up once all of the transactions have been sorted out. Picking a one day metric is somewhat arbitrary, arguably every few hours would be even better.
I will make sure my next series of analysis focuses on individual transactions and overall statistical distribution.

I would call dust any bitcoin address left with a balance of less than one mbtc at the end of the day. If all the bitcoin you own in the world is one mbtc I wouldn't consider you a big 'holder' in the economy.
My analysis tends to focus on individual addresses rather than single transactions alone.
I have an article coming out in a couple of days which presents a lot of this data.

Well I just went ahead and ordered one to try it out.
Ideally a bitcoin debit card would convert bitcoin to USD only at the moment of purchase and, at that, using the best available market price like BitPay and Coinbase do.
With the ANX card you decide when to convert bitcoins to USD ahead of time, so in this respect it isn't much different than Gyft.
The big questions are how fast can you hot load your account? Meaning can you transfer bitcoin to the card moments before the bill comes?
The question of what exchange rate is more important.
I assumed it would be like BitPay and Coinbase, but if there is really some 12.5% spread that is completely unacceptable.
It should be zero and the credit card sweep reaps the merchant fees.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:47:21
Yes, great post.  Because, like Lord Leto, Satoshi had true perfect prescient vision from the rich spice mixture he consumed daily.
Look, Satoshi was awesome, but, he was not perfect.  In fact, massive amounts of his code was commented out, from nearly day one, because it was unsafe and risky.
This is also the ultimate straw man.  Absolutely no one is against scaling bitcoin.  It can, will, and should be scaled.  Scaled to every shape, size, and flavor; **On sidechains and using bi-directional payment channels.**
However, today, the current network is **protecting** 16 billion dollars of value.
The safe, and prudent way forward, is to push all experimental and risky changes to other layers.
There are actually people on these forums seriously promoting something called 'bitcoin unlimited' which fundamentally changes the core bitcoin game theory!! 
It's not a simple blocksize increase but, instead, literally changes the game theory underpinning the entire network.  This is a rather insane and risky proposal, but still it is being considered an acceptable option by many who lack the technical understanding to realize just how insane this is!

Here's a simple explanation, I hope.  When someone submits a transaction on the bitcoin network to be processed by miners, it is possible for a malicious actor to 'listen' for that transaction, make a slight modification to it, and then resubmit the same transaction (slightly modified) to the network.  Once they do this, there is a chance that the modified transaction will be accepted by a miner and incorporated into the blockchain instead of the original one.
This problem has been known for a long time and was generally considered harmless and low priority since the modification that the malicious agent can do to the transaction does not affect the actual transaction in any concrete way (meaning all of the same inputs go to the same outputs in the same amounts).  The malicious agent cannot modify anything in the transaction that is considered important.
Think of it like this as an example.
If I write down the number: 1 or 1.0 or 1.00 or 1.000
In all cases that has the same exact value, even though the format of how we expressed the number changed.  In all cases it still means 1
So, even though the bitcoin network does allow a modified transaction (modified in a harmless way) to be accepted into the blockchain (arguably a bug) it was never considered a 'big deal'.
The problem arises not from the bitcoin network itself, which still works fine, the problem is from poorly implemented wallet software which uses something called a 'transaction id' to identify the original transaction that was sent.  It is probably not unreasonable for a piece of wallet software to assume that the transaction that is included in the blockchain will have the same ID# as the transaction that was sent.  However, since a transaction can be slightly modified by an attacker and this (harmlessly) modified transaction can be included in the blockchain instead of the original one, the transaction ID number can change.  The transaction ID number is a 'hash' of the contents of the transaction; a computed value.
So, if the wallet software looks for the transaction ID they originally sent to show up in the blockchain as 'confirmation' that the transaction succeeded, this allows people to 'spoof' some wallet software.  In the case of MtGox, their software would (possibly) automatically decide the original transaction was unsuccessful and then resend a *new* transaction depleting their funds a second time.  This would allow people to fool MtGox (not bitcoin itself, just MtGox's accounting software) into sending money multiple times to an end user.
All that said, there is deep suspicion that this ever happened in any massive way.  I, and others, have done analysis on the blockchain and we cannot find any appreciable amount of transaction malleability related transactions as showing up in the blockchain and few associated with possible double sends.
I hope this explanation is sufficient.  To be clear, this was an exploit in the bitcoin protocol (one known for years) that could trip up some people's wallet software.  The bitcoin blockchain itself was never at risk and never allowed any double-spends or otherwise invalid transactions to be processed.  This was just an exploit that could trip of some companies bad accounting software.

These shares can only indirectly affect bitcoin price from a psychological perspective.  It may change public 'belief' in what bitcoin is worth.  However, when people are buying GBTC it generates very little buying pressure (if any) on the open bitcoin market.
Now, if people who are BIT investors are trying to get more bitcoins, it could create some buy pressure.
In other words, if they sell GBTC at a premium and then *immediately* take that money and buy more bitcoins; either on the open market or by dumping more money into BIT, then that could create some buy pressure.  But, we don't' seem to have seen that yet.

The tone of your response is as if I made all of this stuff up as a strawman.
Look, if LN proponents said, "Look how awesome this is, it can reduce 50% of all transactions on the network." I would **NOT** be having this discussion.
I direct you to the main Lightning Network website and slides which make these claims, as do all of the LN proponents who claim the blocksize doesn't need to increase because it can 'support 50 million users'.
A 50% reduction in on-chain transactions is probably a realistic and laudable goal.
Sign me up.  I'm in.
But the notion that it can offload 99.99999999999999% of transactions, I didn't make that up!  That is on the LN website, and repeated ad-nausum on these forums, and on the slack channels, daily by LN proponents.

It is a misunderstanding to think bitcoin only has 21 million units.
This is akin to saying, "I only have 21 million tons of gold."
The current base unit of bitcoin is called a 'Satoshi' and there are trillions of them.
And, if were to run out of them, we can shift a decimal point and create more.
What you are describing is not a flaw but rather a key feature of the currency.
As bitcoins are lost, or otherwise more scarce, it just makes everyone's remaining tokens increase in value.
This is a good thing. Something most bitcoin enthusiasts are excited about.
Unlike fiat currency, where trillions are created out of thin air at will by bankers who devalue everyone's money and ultimately fuel a bubble 100% guaranteed to collapse in the future.
If I give you a $100 I can guarantee that in ten years it will be worth less. 100% guaranteed by design.
So long as bitcoin survives and grows with adoption you can be pretty sure it will increase in value.  
Having a predictable money supply ruled by math, rather than bankers, is the preference most of us are choosing.

You keep saying things like 'it has been proven' but you provide no references of data to back that statement up.  Spreading an investment in a volatile commodity over time reduces, to some extent, the degree of volatility risk you encounter.  To me this is a 'proven' fact simply through the data I have presented here, if not common sense itself.  It's simple math.  
You claim that 'nothing can change the fact that you bought at $1,000' but that is simply not true.  If you buy one bitcoin at $1,000 and two bitcoins at $500, then that makes your average cost basis lower.  That is just common sense.

I find the 'bitcoin days destroyed' chart, personally, to not be very useful.
Here is the data you are looking for.
First, here is a graph of every major zombie event, by day, in 2014.
These are absolute values (not days destroyed), so when you see that big spike at 10,000 on April 3; that literally means 10,000 old bitcoins moved.
I use the term 'zombie' to refer to bitcoins associated with an address which has had no spend transactions for three years or more.
Here is a spreadsheet showing all of the major zombie events in 2014; with a list of the public address of each so you can verify for yourself.
Finally, here is a list of every single zombie event for the entire history of the blockchain.

Coinbase is a fine business.  So long as people feel a need to exchange fiat (government backed) currency for bitcoins, then you are going to need some kind of regulated exchange to do so.  Coinbase seems to be a good company that offers an excellent service.
There are ways to purchase bitcoin for fiat without having to submit to the regulatory requirements, but that comes with a price.  You can exchange bitcoin, person to person, in a cafe, but if you go that route you will pay a hefty premium for whatever privacy that affords.
Let us hope that most people interested in acquiring some bitcoin for investment purposes are not criminals and tax dodgers.  If that is the case, then what is the problem with providing the same level of identity verification that is required for all other financial services?
If you sign up for an Etrade account, you know they are going to be providing tax records.  Why should Coinbase be exempt from that?
The most important thing to remember is that after you buy your bitcoins from coinbase you can *immediately remove them to 100% your own control*.  Something I highly recommend everyone do.
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:36:36

I agree a big discussion is necessary before changes are made, but we shouldn't act like a hard fork is somehow inherently an issue.
We have been promised for years that we can solve technical problems with bitcoin through software upgrades.
The tone of this article seems to imply that bitcoin should never be improved to solve any of its well known problems if it requires a fork.
I'm not sure that is something the community expected. I think most of us expect bitcoin to be revised and improved to meet the demands of future growth.
If it is never allowed to evolve that is almost like a death sentence.
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:12:26
The simple fact is more people are selling than buying.
So, who is selling?
* Merchants who "accept" bitcoin but really just convert to fiat immediately
* Miners who have bills to pay. We often hear that bitcoin is a deflationary currency but it is not currently. New bitcoins are created every day which go on the market and drive the price down.
* Early adopters who got thousands of bitcoins for next to nothing sell all of the time. To these guys this current 'low' price is still a massive return, so they don't care.
* Criminals. Bitcoins are being hacked and stolen all of the time. These criminals want to get back as much 'real' money out as fast as they can.
* Disillusioned investors trying to cut their losses. At every price point there are people who sell because they are giving up and trying to stop the bleeding.
So, there is a shit ton of sell pressure.
Now, where is the buy pressure from?
Very, very little. Every day there are fewer and fewer people willing to double dip on supposed 'cheap' coins.
The only way out of this cycle is if something happens that brings in a bunch of buyers. That could be due to economic conditions in a country or maybe some wall street type investment vehicle.
Until then the price looks like it is going to be depressed.

I honestly don't think zombie coins contribute much to price.  Statistically they are quite small and rare events.  The only real threat would be if Satoshi were to dump his million coin stash all at once.  Otherwise, the largest zombie events have been on the order of 10,000 coins.  That's a lot, but probably not going to affect the market too much.
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:15:45
Agreed, but it is still worth monitoring them and looking for statistical trends. The 25,000 in the past three weeks was a truly significant quantity that happens rarely.
@_date: 2015-01-10 19:08:46
Correct, the only tweak I really did was making it the square of the number of days.  The reason I did this is because if someone spends just a tiny amount of bitcoin, but it was from a really, really, long time ago, I want it to stick out like a sore thumb on a graph.

As you can see, most transactions today involve newly generated addresses. We don't know if it is between two people, a mixer, change, or bots.

If 4mb is the maximum, and the average transaction size is about 570 bytes (as it is today) then, at most, only about 10-15 million people can have direct semi-regular access to the network.
What this means is that even if payment channels can offload a near infinite number of transactions (which they can) still only a very tiny population will ever be able to hold or otherwise peg value on a blockchain.
I find that very disappointing.
It's not about the number of cups of coffee, it's about the number of people who can have regular direct access to the blockchain to protect their value safely.
I realize that bitcoin doesn't even have this level of usage today. However, if it cannot scale to a larger population over time, especially if that population is meant to include machines as well as people, then it is dramatically limits the impact it can have on the world.

We generally don't mind newbie questions though reading some FAQs first is probably a good ideal.
My strongest recommendation is that everyone, and I mean absolutely everyone, should buy just a little bit of bitcoin and then, immediately, start using it.
It is the best way to understand it, which is simply to use it. Making an online donation or purchase with bitcoin is so remarkably easier than using a credit card it simply must be experienced first hand.
As far as whether to invest in bitcoin as a long term bet, yeah, it is still a good time and, if bitcoin survives, almost always a good time.
That said, it should still be considered a high risk investment, not just because of short term volatility but also because bitcoin could still fail for a number of reasons.
So, only invest long term what you can afford to safely lose and, please, regularly buy small amounts for daily use.
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:21:49

Coinbase and Circle are both good. I can't really recommend one over the other.
About paper wallets. Let me explain.
To say you "own" bitcoins is to say that you *control* a password that gives you the right to spend a certain quantity of them.
It is really that simple. Whoever has the password, owns the bitcoins.
However, when you use a piece of bitcoin software, usually called a wallet, that software is managing these passwords for you. The problem there is that most software these days can be hacked or attacked. Or your computer might crash without a proper backup.
So, the absolute safest way to secure bitcoins is to simply store your password on a sheet of paper that has never been on the internet.
But, getting paranoid even further, what if someone steals your sheet of paper with the password?
That is why now we have a standard called BIP38 which allows you to encode and print your password (called a private key) in such a way they it requires yet another password to access it.
For the mechanics of this just Google "how to create a paper wallet".

Here is what I meant by 'fake'.
Every single day 5-10% of all transactions involve 'dust'. I, personally, consider dust on the network as chaff and certainly not indicative that the transaction volume has some larger economic meaning. Most of these dust transactions are generated by automated systems, not individuals.
The other thing I mean when I say 'fake', and more significant than dust, are zero balance transactions.
Today, due to privacy concerns, fewer and fewer people (or automated systems) are willing to simply create a single transaction to send value. Instead, intermediate transactions, often many of them, are created as 'throwaways' to mix or otherwise obscure the source of funds.
I would argue that large volumes of dust and scratch throwaway  transactions to confuse the source of funds is largely responsible for the rise in transaction volume.
In fact, I bet only a very tiny percentage of transactions actually represent a single person moving nontrivial value from person A to B. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:22:08
Are you aware that every time you have bought something online, be it eBay, amazon, Craigslist, or even at a garage sale you owe taxes?
And, if the sales tax was not taken out by the seller then you are personally responsible for self reporting and paying those taxes? And, if you don't account for every penny, you are committing criminal tax fraud?
Do you know how many people have self reported the billions and billions of dollars of unpaid sales taxes for online purchases? Virtually no one.
Add to that, due to bitcoin's price decline of last year most people would be showing losses not a gain.
When a tax rule is so nonsensical and puts the burden of self reporting on the consumer it, frankly, generally gets ignored.
So, yeah, you have a tax reporting requirement, just like you do for all of your other online purchases that you already ignore.

Yes, it is a threat. Bitcoin has first mover advantage and network effect. It also has a well known and understand inflation schedule and monetary supply.
However, bitcoin's development environment is broken and poisonous. The system is unable to scale and the development team in control is unable or unwilling to listen to the people who actually use the network.
By all measure ethereum doesn't seem to have these problems.

I assume you mean SegWit.  SegWit does not achieve a 1.8mb effective blocksize until every single wallet has been updated to support it.
Meanwhile, a 2mb blocksize increase requires virtually no change or, if so, like a one line code change, to any existing wallet software.
It is safer, simpler, and easier.
I believe they should both be done; and SW should be done as a hard-fork, which will be far less cludgy and hacky.
Also, LN launching in any form doesn't mean much.  It will take years for it to be integrated into the entire bitcoin ecosystem of wallets, exchanges, and payment providers.  As well, it will take years for users (you know, the actual freaking customers) to trust the LN with more than a minuscule amount of value.  The community must be ready and willing to switch to the LN. Quite frankly, right now, the community as a whole is pretty pissed off.  
You guys all assume that just because LN launches, magically, everyone will come running and dump all of their bitcoin into open channels overnight.
This may never happen!  Trust is earned.  What has Blockstream done to earn the trust of the bitcoin community?
It took years before people were willing to dedicate more than pocket change to the bitcoin network.  People trust it today, as a store of value and payment network.  You think people will just give all of that same trust to LN overnight?

So, I should probably have explained this better in my article.
Pay-2-Script hashes are almost exclusively being used for multi-sig.
What happened is Gavin implemented the standard script instruction for multi-sig originally.  However, it was almost never actually used.
Shortly after, he introduced Pay-2-Scripth hash, which can not only be used to implement multi-sig but a whole bunch of other things.  Pay-2-Script hash is much more general purpose/programmable, so now the original multi-sig is largely deprecated and no one is using it.

The 'rational' explanation is the obvious one.  
Almost all bitcoin supporters over the past five+ years, got involved because they believed in the promise of a global peer-to-peer electronic cash system.  Today, the current core development teams says, "Nope, that's not what it is.  It's a high-value,  high-fee, settlement layer for the wealthy, banks, and other institutions.  There is no room for regular users on the blockchain.
Here...just wait for this piece of vaporware and shut up."
The community is rightly, and deeply, concerned about the future of this project that we all invested in, and watching it get taken over by a group of radicals who want to turn it into something else entirely is the rational 'explanation' for this 'shitstorm'.
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:55:27
Yes, I thought that might be interesting because whenever coins are mixed often times that leads to a huge number of inputs and outputs.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:08:50
I'll try an analogy.  Maybe it's like, why doesn't everyone have five hundred gallon gas tanks on their car?
Increasing the block-size has costs.  Right now the blockchain is a scarce resource; very scarce, but it can be relatively easily be run on any laptop computer.
As the block size increases twenty fold it, in turn, increases the disk storage and network bandwidth requirements twenty fold.  That's a big increase.

With this configuration, I can send $1,000, but I cannot receive a single penny.
Now...once I have sent $1,000, I can receive a $1,000 in return, but only until then.

Under the current rules no miner can unilaterally change the blocksize, since no single mining pool has 51% hashrate.
However, a couple of mining pools could agree to attack the network by running a hacked client with a different blocksize limit.
Note that word, "attack".
That's what it is when a group of miners collude to perform a 51% attack on the network.
With BU's new 'emergent consensus' this is no longer considered an attack. Dynamically adjusting one of the most important consensus metrics of the network is now enabled, at the protocol level, as being allowed.
The BU crowd would have you believe blocksize is a meaningless metric which merely controls the number of transactions the network can perform.
That is not true. It opens up wide avenues of attack, especially if unbounded as BU proposes.
It controls bandwidth, storage, orphan rate, transmission time, CPU consumption, and affects numerous pieces of live software in the ecosystem.
Opening up that metric to be dynamically manipulated by any couple of cooperating miners, without it being treated as an active "attack" on the network, is highly dangerous.
If some people want a bigger blocksize limit, then propose it. But BU is not that. It opens up a myriad of new attack vectors on the network and changes the underlying game theory. Now miners can manipulate the blocksize for short term gain, to push out competitors, or due to the heavy influence of one nation state where they are co-located.
Want the Chinese government to make the rules for bitcoin miners? No problem. Endorse BU.

As we have already seen with bitcoin, people are actually more likely to buy things when they are using a currency which has increased in value; because they have more purchasing power.
During bitcoins' recent downward trend in price people have been less likely to spend because that means realizing a loss.

So, after learning more about this, I feel like this card isn't being accurately described.  What it is, is a pre-paid USD debit card that you can load by selling them bitcoin, way, way, way, ahead of time; not at the time of purchase.
Calling it a bitcoin debit card is a bit of a stretch, as it only holds USD which just happened to have been converted from btc, days, and days, ahead of time.
My ideal bitcoin debit card would convert bitcoin to USD *at the time of purchase* at the best conversion rate at that time; and I would be able to reload my bitcoin on the fly as fast as normal transaction times.
Meaning, I could sit down to dinner, hot-load enough bitcoins to cover the meal, and by the time the check comes, it would be available to pay for the bill.
My motivation in having this feature is security.  If I load up my wallet ahead of time with thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins, and my debit card is lost or stolen, then that is a huge problem.
I don't think the ANX card is particularly useful in its current form.

If I had the answer to that question....I would be the bitcoin hero of the day.
From my understanding the current hope is as follows..
The hope is that bitcoin mining chips are soon going to hit a wall where they cannot get substantially faster than they are today; due to hitting the physical limits of moores law.
Once that happens (probably less than two years from now), then bitcoin mining hardware becomes a true 'commodity' item.  
Once that happens, then bitcoin mining could be completely ubiquitous and highly distributed.  This was kind of the idea 21 Inc. originally had.  They wanted to get a bitcoin mining chip in nearly every electronic device on the planet.  However, it doesn't appear that's working out for them.
So, once hash-power is no longer concentrated in the hands of the few, we could in theory see much greater decentralization.  Of course, you would still face centralization of mining pools but since people can readily switch which pool they want to participate in, that should help maintain a degree of decentralization as well.
Right now, today, the way things are, the outlook is bleak.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:30:34
To be clear, this card is only, very technically, a 'bitcoin' debit card.  It actually does not process bitcoins.
It is a standard pre-loaded USD debit card.  It does not hold bitcoins, it does not process bitcoins, it does not use bitcoins when you make a transaction; just USD.
The only thing that makes it 'bitcoin' is that you can sell bitcoins to load the card with USD.
Now, if you could sell them, on the spot, to 'hot load' the wallet, then it might actually be useful. However, you have to pre-load it days in advance, so calling this thing a 'bitcoin' debit card is a big stretch.

I will try to post some links later. The quick answer is that it takes an order of magnitude more transistors on a chip to implement floating point operations than integer.
Floating point wasn't even available on computer chips for many years, instead it was implemented in software. Eventually Intel introduced the floating-point coprocessor as an optional add on.
Even when computer chips generally had floating point units they were still very slow. Most 3d computer games in the early nineties still faked everything with integer math.
Today most processors have floating point units and they are now very fast too; but it still takes a lot more transistors to implement over straight integer math.
Do a Google search on the history of IEEE floating point.

The network is currently at a near saturated state on a regular basis. Because it is near saturated it makes attacking the network much less expensive.
SegWit will not achieve a benefit until all wallet software has been updated, which will take a significant period of time.  
LN coming 'online this year', doesn't mean much.  LN requires a massive, massive, massive, infrastructure change to be effective.  It will be years before wallets, exchanges, and payment processors support LN.  It will take a long time for the community to build trust in  it and be willing to commit a significant amount of value to it.  The fact that some version might launch 'this year' means little.
The risk of a modest blocksize increase has been wildly exaggerated.

I don't see this as a big mystery.  Good news aside, where is the buy pressure?
Here are the reasons there is so much sell pressure:
* Merchants who "accept" bitcoin but really just convert to fiat immediately
* Miners who have bills to pay. We often hear that bitcoin is a deflationary currency but it is not currently. New bitcoins are created every day which go on the market and drive the price down.
* Early adopters who got thousands of bitcoins for next to nothing sell all of the time. To these guys this current 'low' price is still a massive return, so they don't care.
* Criminals. Bitcoins are being hacked and stolen all of the time. These criminals want to get back as much 'real' money out as fast as they can.
* Disillusioned investors trying to cut their losses. At every price point there are people who sell because they are giving up and trying to stop the bleeding.
So, there is a shit ton of sell pressure.
Now, where is the buy pressure from?
Very, very little. Every day there are fewer and fewer people willing to double dip on supposed 'cheap' coins.
The only way out of this cycle is if something happens that brings in a bunch of buyers. That could be due to economic conditions in a country or maybe some wall street type investment vehicle.
Until then the price looks like it is going to be depressed.

Yes, if you remove low-value payment transactions that makes more room for users...up to a point.

It will (and is) failing because no one cares. Most people don't want it. We had a solid year of mostly positive news in terms of merchant adoption but user adoption is flat and the price reflects that.
So, it fails because not enough people choose to use it and expose themselves to its extreme volatility.
I can't blame them. I'm a huge bitcoin supporter and try to make almost all of my online purchases using bitcoin but even I would have been better off using a credit card as the currency has steadily declined in value all year. Even trying to average, well the average is down.
For bitcoin to succeed it needs less volatility and a general trend of increasing in value over time.
So, lack of interest, declining price, and extreme volatility are hurting bitcoin to the point that it will probably never see mainstream adoption.

We have been told for five years that 'when transaction volume becomes an issue' we can simply increase the blocksize to accommodate it.  These comments are in the source code.  This has always been the plan.  So, why is this a 'controversy' now???
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:56:49
You could try investing it over a longer period of time and dollar average or, if you think the price is good now, buy it all at once.  Lots of people who invested in bitcoin have a cost basis a lot higher than the current price.
All that said, remember that bitcoin should still be considered a very high-risk investment. Not only is it volatile, but its value could go to zero based on a number of possible factors.
Because of this, you should only invest what you are willing to lose.  If losing 25k is something you can just shrug off as a bad investment outcome, then sure, go for it.
If losing 25k would cause you a lot of personal pain, you probably shouldn't do it.
If watching your 25k investment, on paper, go up and down in value like a Mexican jumping bean would cause you stress, then you should probably avoid it as well.
If you are a competent and qualified day trader, well, if you were you probably wouldn't be asking this question.  Due to the volatility, there is a lot of money to be made in this market by savvy day traders.
Bitcoin as an investment is best to think of as a long term binary bet.  Exactly like putting money into an early venture capital backed startup; where you are accepting a great deal of risk for a potential large reward, or total loss.
If bitcoin still exists in say five years time, it is hard to imagine it would be worth less than it is today.  However, in five years time here are some of the things which could happen to bitcoin:
* It could become the 'myspace' of Cryptocurrencies where it fades out and is replaced be something more popular. It might simply fail to grow fast enough to meet the demands of the market place.  There are many outstanding technical challenges remaining.
* A general loss of faith in the currency, due to continued volatility, lack of consumer adoption, and reports of hacks and lost funds.
* Governments start over-regulating it or even outright making it illegal to use.  People start going to jail for tax evasion, criminal use, etc. and that alone scares off enough people from using it.
* A bug or other error in the software could introduce devastating losses and make the ecosystem collapse.
* Attacks on the network might take it offline for extended period of time and again produce a loss of faith.
There's a whole lot going against bitcoin right now.  The volatility is pretty difficult to stomach and the volatility really reduces it's potential value to individual consumers.
All that said, I have personally invested about as much as you are suggesting.  I have done so, even though I am aware of all of these risks.  My cost basis is also substantially less than the current market value, so it causes a lot less indigestion when I am looking at profits on paper.
My first recommendation, as always, is to buy *some* bitcoin and start using it.  Make some donations to good causes.  Give some tips to friends and family.  Buy some things online and see if there are physical retailers in your area where you can buy a meal or drink with it.

Welcome to the real-world.  
Sometimes it is worth remembering that even if all bitcoin to fiat and fiat to bitcoin exchanges are heavily regulated with lots of reporting, that alone does not destroy most of the advantages of bitcoin.
To date, no one has seriously proposed prohibiting direct peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions (something which is technically impossible to do, but could be made practically difficult by governments).
As someone who's long term goal it to not use fiat at all, these exchanges don't concern me that much.  My long term goal is not to 'cash out' but rather to never have to at all.
In the meantime, governments are going to monitor these things, and that's just reality.
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:37:06
You and me both brother, well said! In an era of negative interest rates, asset forfeiture, and banks limiting access to cash, the volatility of bitcoin can seem like the safer bet.

As long as the price of bitcoin doubles every four years then the block reward stays the same.
On top of that, as bitcoin evolves into primarily a settlement layer, fees will grow.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:09:54
From a number of lines of code standpoint, maybe. But it does nothing more functionally than a simple blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:15:33
I agree. I also wonder why sidechains are not considered part of the scaling  solution. Since, in theory, one could launch dozens of sidechians to serve different communities.
Meaning, while the LN requires on chain transactions for each user, a sidechain does not require individual users to peg value against the main blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 15:03:57
Did you miss my point? To 'hold value in bitcoin' still requires on-chain transactions. For example, with LN these are channel open and close transactions. While they are infrequent they are definitely still real on chain pressure.
The blocksize limit, in addition to gating the total number of transactions, also gates the total number of users. Even if 100% of all payment transactions are moved to layer-2 networks, still only a relatively small number of people (measured on a global scale) can ever 'peg' value to the main chain.

All I can guess is that someone(?) is buying all the bitcoin they can without raising the price above around $420.
This has been going on for the past few weeks.
While literally over a hundred million dollars worth of value has moved into ETH, and bitcoin is in the middle of its worst crisis and public relations nightmare since MtGox, the price is barely budging.
It seems unusual and not part of the normal price behavior we have seen in the past.

They do indeed.  In the form of increasing the value of bitcoin by making sure people can still access it.
@_date: 2016-03-09 19:32:30


That would only work if:
* The participant is willing to dedicate the maximum amount of value they ever intend to send or receive over a 3 month period.
* The participant can find someone else willing to commit an equal amount of value to keep the channel balanced
* The user only operates in a hub-and-spoke model which will be highly centralized.  For it to be decentralized, the participants of the network need likely at least four channels open; not one.
You mention watching the video, right?  The video doesn't mention any of the complex real world issues facing building the actual functioning network.  It only talks about the specifics of signing the smart contracts involved. Which is great, and important, but just a tiny piece of the overall problem.
@_date: 2016-03-09 20:19:28


Yes, the bitcoin network uses game theory to reach consensus through proof of work.  It took a long time before people 'trusted' that system as good enough to hold value and, even today, people still remain nervous about a 51% attack.  Due to miner centralization this is still a real and legitimate concern today.
The game theory around LN has not ever been tested.  It is based on the 'threat of losing all funds', but this is accomplished via highly time-sensitive claiming transactions.  While it is certainly a cool ideal, it will have to be proven in the real-world.  This takes time, a lot of time, and trial by fire from the worlds most persistent hackers to know whether or not it is truly fail-safe.  Just because the idea sounds good on paper, doesn't mean it will work perfectly in the real-world.  


How is it not a hot-wallet?
LN transactions *are* bitcoin transactions.  For them to be valid, the parties need to sign them.
Now, if you want a unidirectional channel, it might be feasible to insert a hardware wallet and manually sign each spend transaction you perform.  
However, if you did that, then the LN would be solely a hub-and-spoke model with massive centralization.
For the LN to work, signed transactions have to be forwarded throughout the network; and that requires computers connected to the internet capable of signing transactions *automatically*.
Are you seriously suggesting that the LN can handle 'billions of transactions' a day with every single participant inserting a Trezor every single time they forward a signed transaction?
Obviously not.  Explain to me how the network operates without software which automatically signs transactions on behalf of the user?
And, what do you mean by 'outsourcing'?  You mean allow a centralized 3rd party solution to sign your transactions for you?  If that is your solution, well, we already have that today, it is called Circle and Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-03-09 14:12:51
It's not me who keeps repeating it. It is LN proponents who claim with LN there is no need for a blocksize increase.
Why don't they put up a new slide deck which shows a blockchain which is a mix of channel transactions with other activity, and a realistic estimate of the number of channels people will actually need to open and close taking into account requirements for decentralization and rebalancing?
Why not use more realistic estimates?
We need to improve communications about what is a realistic outcome.

There is nothing 'simple' about the LN.  It is a highly complex network that incorporates some very sophisticated game theory that is supposed to prevent attack vectors; including things like having 'bounties' posted to the general network to make sure no one can steal your funds.
For it to remain decentralized all participants will need multiple 'always on' LN channels which will effectively make their software a 'hot-wallet'.
You are correct that LN transactions *are* bitcoin transactions.  That part is true.  But the peer-to-peer layer to negotiate signing those transactions is highly complex and unproven.  People will require an enormous amount of trust that this software works and cannot easily be hacked.
@_date: 2016-03-09 17:49:24


Gosh..I wonder just where I could have gotten that ideal.  Oh wait, yeah, it's from the Lightning Network website.
Note that the slide claims that people will only ever need **ONE** channel every **SIX MONTHS**.
This is not a realistic use case.  The thing is, small-block proponents continuously use this slide as justification for why we need no on-chain scaling *today*.

Because LN does a bunch of things the bitcoin network cannot do.
* instant confirmation
* true microtransactions, it can literally support billions of transactions of miniscule value; something bitcoin cannot, nor should ever be asked to do.
* enhanced privacy of transactions
The LN is great for small value transactions, leaving the main blockchain free for more active users and larger value transactions.

You are wrong about how many channels and with what frequency they will be opened. The LN works great for low value transactions but has many issues with high amounts value. As well, to keep LN decentralized as a mesh network, every user will need likely four or more open channels.
People will still perform on-chain transactions for high value payments. 
LN still requires a reasonable number of on-chain transactions that *must* be confirmed in a timely manner.

Yes. The answer is yes. Bitcoin was designed to work and behave like cash or, maybe even gold.

The only thing protecting your entire stash of bitcoin is the protection of a password. That, and trust in a huge array of software products.

Better question, why are we crippling bitcoin today based on vaporware promises of tomorrow?  Especially when the claims of what the LN is capable of achieving are wildly exaggerated.
If people start out by stating lies about what the tech can actually accomplish, isn't that a big warning sign?
LN proponents like to paint a scenario that in the future no one will ever need to perform on-chain transactions.  This is simply not true.
The LN works fantastically well for low-value transactions, but to remain decentralized it requires many more open channels and it cannot handle large value transactions well (due to channels becoming imbalanced and numerous other concerns).
@_date: 2016-03-13 18:44:06

There really isn't a whole lot to do to make it work.  A LN node has to be synced to more than one blockchain is all.  As long as they are fairly compatible in terms of scripting rules, etc. (which most would be as they would likely all be based off of the same core source code), then implementing it is fairly trivial.
What makes this work is when you realize that the primary thing that the LN does is allow for the rapid exchange of signatures to open smart-contracts.  This process of changing signatures, in no way, has to happen on the same chain.

RBF only has a purpose if the bitcoin network is highly constrained, moving all payment transactions off to layer 2 networks. Thus, the only on chain transactions will be for settlement.
*edit* RBF does have one other use. It allows for fraudulent activity and makes scamming people really easy. It's like handing someone a dollar bill with a rubber band attached so you can snatch it back out of their hands.

As a soft fork the implementation is inherently going to be hacky. It will also 'silently' and in unexpected ways cause all kinds of existing software to fail.
As a hard fork, the implementation can be more simple and vastly cleaner. No hacks. And, as a planned and scheduled hard fork, (otherwise known as a software upgrade, a standard practice throughout the entire software industry) the community will have a lengthy amount of time to cleanly revise their software with a non-hacky solution.
Rushing a soft fork, guaranteed to break all kinds of software, without sufficient testing,  and with a hacky implementation is definitely not the right way to do this.
Contrary to the party line in this sub, hard forks are safer and cleaner than soft forks. Regularly scheduled and well planned software upgrades should be embraced by the community.

I think once there is an ETF, with a lot of liquidity which you can easily get into and out of with normal trading, (not OTC limit only orders) then there will be no appreciable spread because of the arbitrage opportunities. I think the spread on GBTC will not only disappear but the price will drop below the bitcoin value because its a shitty asset. It has very high fees and it is like a weird derivative. It is an asset based on an asset someone else held for 18 months.
Do I think bitcoin will reach $600 this year? Yeah, probably. And maybe the price people are paying for GBTC is because they are betting on that. Or they are just paying the premium because it is pretty much the only way to get bitcoin exposure in your 401k. 
That is certainly what I have been doing. I bought GBTC for my IRA at 27, and sold at 59. So, regardless of whether it is closely tracking the bitcoin price or not, fuck it, I made money.
I know that as soon as the winklevoss ETF is available I will sell any GBTC I am holding immediately. I expect so will everyone else.

@_date: 2017-03-20 23:22:17
I don't care for this picture, because it doesn't reflect the fact that fees collected on secondary layers are merely used to fund on-chain transactions themselves.  Meaning, the miners **do get** the fees collected on secondary layers, whenever open or close channel events occur, or a sidechain does merge-mining, those on-chain events are paid for out of the fees collected on the secondary layer.
They **do** get the fees from the secondary layers too!
Plus, they can run their own LN nodes and sidechains and collect fees directly from them as well.
The biggest point, of course, is that enabling layer-2 networks will increase the price of bitcoin; which is the main factor which controls how much money they make.

They literally do not understand that the demand for cheap on-chain transaction capacity is orders of magnitude larger than the largest blocksize technically feasible.

One thing people should remember.  All of the quite legitimate concerns about using a 3rd party to perform transactions off-chain do not necessarily apply for micro-transactions.
There is no way I want transactions of fractions of penny happening on the main blockchain (and they couldn't anyway what with an average transaction fee over a nickel).  However, if someone wants to 'hold 25 cents on my behalf' to pay for micro-transactions, I don't think I really care that they are centralized or hold my funds.

BU is trying to change a hard consensus limit, one never ever designed to be 'changed on the fly'.  This is a consensus rule that must be agreed upon by the entire network.  Now, we are going to change it, at the protocol level, to be dynamically adjusted at the whim of the majority of the network hashpower alone; with no sign on required from the rest of the ecosystem.  
So, what used to be perceived as a 51% attack is now, no longer an attack.  It's just a way to game the system to someones advantage.
As things stand today, it takes only a handful of mining pools to come to an agreement that if they find that tuning the blocksize limit, either up or down, gives them some advantage over other mining pools, they can do so.  Mining is a cut-throat business which is already very aggressive in terms of how they try to compete with each other.
BU supporters push this off as 'no big deal' and 'they can do this already', but it is a big deal.  And they can't do it already today without signalling to the entire world that they are running a hacked client and executing a hard-fork attack on the network.
BU changes all of that.  It's no longer an 'attack'.  Now it's 'emergent consensus'.  Not Nakamoto consensus, but some new flawed consensus model that is untested and, as already explained numerous times in this thread, is open to a wide array of new attack vectors.  Not to mention the fact **NO ONE IN THE TECHNICAL COMMUNITY BELIEVES THE BLOCKSIZE LIMIT SHOULD BE UNBOUNDED**!!
There's an argument to be made to allow the blocksize limit to grow, a modest amount, to give the network some runway until layer-2 systems are available.  Segwit is an example of that argument in action.  There is **NO ARGUMENT** to be made for unbounded, open-ended, **ON-CHAIN GEOMETRIC SCALING** which BU allows.  That, plus the massive changes to the source code that bypassed all existing process, and the wildly dangerous changes to the consensus mechanism, make BU a very, very, reckless proposal deserving *no* hash power.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:41:13

No.  I'm saying that if the miners throw more hashing power at the network that is THE GAMBLE THEY TAKE!
That's like blaming the dealer for a gambler's own bad bets.
Everyone knows the rules to the game.  If you throw more hashing power at the network, as does everyone else, the difficulty rises.  The only way you are making your money back is if the price rises accordingly.  Which is why the difficult adjusts, of course.
If miners want to just keep making bad gambling decisions by throwing ever more and more hash power (i.e. electricity and hardware costs) for a diminishing return, that's their own damned fault.
However...since the block-reward halved, and the price has effectively doubled, given the *same* hash-rate, to provide the *same* level of security as they were before, their reward would stay the same.  If they throw more hash power at it (their choice), they are betting on even higher prices.

Segwit hasn't been activated for political, not technical reasons. It offers a near doubling of transaction capacity and does, in fact, increase the blocksize limit.
There is a clear technical path forward to scale bitcoin using different network layers.
As a software engineer myself, I am confident that this is the correct technical solution to the problem.
BU is not a blocksize increase. In fact, it allows any small group of miners to collude to actually make the blocksize even smaller.
It changes the consensus mechanism for the network and it is both reckless and dangerous.

I've heard it may be technically possible to do LN without segwit, but it's very hacky to do it that way.
And, this is a silly argument anyway.  The current core client is a continuation of a successful software engineering project by a massive team of people.  For it to be blocked now, for stupid political reasons, (meaning not technical at all), is counterproductive.
If it doesn't get adopted, it doesn't matter.  Bitcoin continues to function as the new digital gold and all of our bitcoins end up in the hands of billionaires and hedge-funds.  Not sure that is the outcome anyone was really hoping for. 
We need *both* digital-gold/safe-store of value, and a payment layer; of which LN is only a *portion* of the total solution.

Unlikely, but you can follow some common sense procedures to be relatively safe.  Most people, including myself, are quite comfortable storing small amounts of bitcoin on on their cellphone wallet.  I recommend using Mycelium.


The best way, if it is an option, is to attend a 'bitcoin meetup' group in your area.  This will accomplish two things.  First, someone will be happy to sell you $20 worth of bitcoin in person and, second, they will be able to answer all your questions that you might have about the topic.
If there is no bitcoin meetup in your area, you have several options.  One is to see if anyone near you is selling bitcoins via the Mycelium app you installed on your android cell phone.  Or you can sign up for an account with Circle or Coinbase.  You can also try localbitcoins.com


Yes, all the time.


Like I said, a bitcoin meetup group is your best bet.  Just try to find anyone you know IRL that has bitcoin.


It has been a lot less volatile lately.  More likely it will be worth $19 one day and $21 the next.


No, bitcoin behaves like cash.  This is on purpose.  


There is no such thing as a 'wallet company'.  Bitcoins are protected by a password.  I really huge ass password.  All a 'wallet' does is manage your password.  
Bitcoins are stored on a global ledger called the blockchain.  To access them (to send and receive transactions) you use a piece of software called a 'wallet' which just handles submitting and receiving the transactions and manages your bitcoin password (known as a private key).

So, let's take the LN for example.  On the LN network there might be tens of thousands of transactions, it not billions of transactions, for every single on-chain transaction.
Each of those LN transactions might have a very tiny fee associated with them.  However, once an actual on-chain transaction is performed, in the form of an open and close channel operation, it might have a substantial fee (say on the order of some number of dollars).  Obviously, all of the transaction fees collected on the secondary layer must be sufficient to pay for the on-chain fee.
In the case of a sidechain, every single time value is pegged and transferred to or from the sidechain to the mainchain, it too will need to pay a substantial fee which would come from the aggregate of layer-2 fees.
This is a rather silly debate.  If layer-2 systems were to enable tens of millions of new users and billions upon billions of micro-transactions, all pegged to and secured by the main chain, obviously the fees on the secondary would accrue to the main-chain whenever channels or opened and closed or otherwise pegged.
This is a tide which lifts all boats.  It is not at the expense of the main chain.
In addition, today, and for a long time to come, the bulk of the revenue a miner gets is in the form of the subsidy.  By enabling layer-2 systems which could expand the scope of bitcoin by many orders of magnitude, it is rather clear this would lead to a much, much, much, higher valuation of bitcoin.
The number one way miners can increase their revenue is to enable the bitcoin network to grow in terms of utility and user base.
If layer-2 systems bring on tens of millions of more users, and billions of additional micro-transactions, than clearly the value of bitcoin the token will skyrocket!
Would they rather have a $10,000 bitcoin, or collect more 4 cent fees while destroying the decentralized nature of the network that gives it the most value to begin with!??

If you remove low-value payment transactions that makes more room for users...up to a point.

As many have already pointed out, in that scenario you need to be a doomsday prepper and gold will be fairly low on your list of concerns or needs.
Not my favorite book in the world, but I read it anyway, "One Second After" by John Matherson tells a first person narrative of what it would be like to try to survive a nationwide EMP attack.
If I recall, most of the focus was on food, water, guns, medicine. I don't even remember gold being mentioned.

I don't get that logic.  Their employer's investors are investing in bitcoin because they think bitcoin could be a huge wild success.  And, the employees are incentivized through time-locked bitcoin awards.
Meaning, everyone's incentive is to optimize for bitcoin success.
How is that bad for bitcoin?  Incentivizing actors through shared prosperity and rewards of value is how the whole network even operates.
I know many of these guys personally by now.  I talked with them for hours at bitcoin conferences.  I have never met any group more passionate about protecting the bitcoin network than this group of individuals.
They may not have done the best job of communicating online, but their motivations are very clear.  Protect the network.  Grow bitcoin as a currency.  Create additional layers to let it take over the world.
They are the ones pushing for these incredible layer-2 technologies which will allow bitcoin to transform the whole world and economy.  I couldn't be more excited about the future of bitcoin.

BU is not a scaling solution!
It has no blocksize increase in it!
It not only allows the blocksize to increase (through 'emergent consensus', i.e. a couple of mining pools getting together), it also allows them to *decrease* it.
Worse yet, it has no limits or caps on it.  The blocksize could be made massively large or very small with just the cooperation of a couple of mining pools.
Worse yet than even that, it employs new game theory for one of the most important consensus rules of the bitcoin network.  A consensus rule which governs *much more* than simply 'how many cheap transactions can I make'.
It controls all of kinds of resource consumption limits; every one of which could be 'gamed' in the form of an attack.
Under the old consensus rules everyone is required to abide by the same exact set of rules and anyone not doing so, was considered an active attacker of the network which would allow the community to respond appropriately.
Under this new 'emergent consensus' any small group of players can manipulate the rules for their own short term personal gain or benefit, most likely to lock out their competitors.
BU is *not* a blocksize increase.  It's the most dangerous hard-fork attack ever attempted against the network!!!
@_date: 2016-01-03 18:20:33
This. 
I have been buying and selling GBTC for about six months. I kept selling because I wanted to limit my exposure. Every time I have sold, based on a price drop in bitcoin, I have ended up losing money on paper.
A little over a week ago, when bitcoin had a large price correction, I sold my position. Since then GBTC *rose* from 59 to 63.
I think people are buying GBTC with a long term outlook expecting it to 'double in 2016' based on numerous media reports. That is why the price doesn't track very well, people are betting more on its future value and less concerned about day to day fluctuations.
All that said, I'm up 70k even with my sub-optimal trades.

@_date: 2017-03-28 19:27:48
So.....I thought the same thing until I realized the solution.
The solution to the problem of onramping hundreds of millions of people is not by having them open up channels on the main bitcoin network, but by having them open up channels on well secured sidechains.
The technical term for this is 'sharding'.
This is not a short term problem anyway.  But we do have a long term solution.
The secret sauce here, that not enough people yet realize, is that the LN works **across multiple blockchains seamlessly**.
This is the magic glue that can bind all blockchains together; especially if they share the same unit token of value.

I come from the video game industry, so I guess we just have a different philosophy. We typically have a number of build configurations; debug, checked, and release.
Asserts have performance impacts that we just can't afford in video games.
We may have some fatal shutdown checks in a release build, but only in special cases. Our games receive extensive QA and are supposed to be pretty crash proof in a final shipping build.
I guess it just depends on your product life cycle.

@_date: 2017-03-21 22:52:13
Wow, you really haven't been thinking about this.
How about charging 1/10th of one penny to watch a single viral YouTube video?
How about charging 1 penny to read an article on a major news site?
This enables an entire new economy built on aggregation of massive numbers of micro-transactions.
How about paying a fraction of a penny per minute or second to be connected to some streaming content?
How about machines paying each other for access to various services?
The use cases for mass scale microtransactions are many.  This could totally transform the entire Internet away from being driven by 'ad revenue' and 'clicks' and instead allow users to pay for the content they consume in incredibly tiny bite sized chunks.
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:26:31
True. But that is always true. Bitcoin does not scale exponentially on chain, so on-chain scaling will never serve a global audience.
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:12:38
Yes. Sidechains are the only way to onramp many tens of millions of new users. They could never operate on the main chain anyways.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:50:49
It is not a blocksize increase. It is a radical change to the bitcoin consensus mechanism.
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:54:01
I'm still so naive I think we all want the same thing.  I think we all want bitcoin to scale to everyone in the world and we just differ about the right technical way to get there.  
However, there is a reality here.
There are two major kinds of bitcoin users.  People who treat bitcoin as an investment/commodity/digital-gold-like asset and the people who want to use it as a payment network.
The thing to understand here is that the people who want to use bitcoin as an investment vehicle, for it's unique properties as a currency (21 million coins, fixed inflation schedule, etc. etc) do not need on-chain scaling.
Frankly, most of the people will **prefer** 3rd party custodial accounts.  They are going to want to use Etrade, Fidelity, Schwabb over meeting some stranger at localbitcoins or otherwise navigating the backwaters of trying to acquire bitcoin in the real world.
If an ETF launches, and I realize that is a really big if, it will allow bitcoin to scale to many tens of millions of new users over night.  Sure, they will all be on 3rd party custodial accounts but, frankly, these people will prefer that.  They will feel far safer having their COIN shares sitting on an exchange they are familiar with, with all of their existing trading tools.
The point here is that the investor class does not need any on-chain scaling, including segwit.
If someone wants to pay $10 to perform an actual on-chain transaction to control their own personal wealth, they will happily do so.  
What segwit offers is a way to get some on-chain scaling today and, most importantly, accelerate layer-2 technologies which in theory all true bitcoiners really care about and want to see happen.
But, it's important to note.  It's not needed for this use case. 
If segwit never activates and the network continues to function exactly as it does today, with the same transaction capacity, the digital-gold use case is not blocked.  Also, federated sidechains, which obviously are not fully decentralized but at least limit custodial control, can and do still work, as they are working today.
So, if the on-chain scaling crowd thinks the digital-gold folks are somehow going to 'fold' at some point.  That's really not going to happen.
So, perhaps people just start flowing value into some alt-coin which is more focused on low-fee, low-value, fast confirmation payment transactions, maybe that's where things end up.  
Everyone likes to say bitcoin is useless if you can't use it for payments.  But it's not.  Because you can still use it for payments.  People are moving money on it all of the time; arguably with ever higher and higher fees pricing out low-value use cases; but to the digital gold crowd that's not a problem.
Personally, I want the best of both worlds.  I want my digital gold, and I also want my layer-2 networks.  That's what segwit offers as a path forward, but don't think that the digital-gold use case somehow 'needs' the payment network use case.
If wealthy people can send $10,000 around the world in 10 minutes for a couple of bucks, that's plenty functional enough for their needs.

What purpose does it have? Who wants it? Who asked for it? Don't say it is about stuck transactions, because there are far easier and safer ways to deal with that.
It only has a 'purpose' if the bitcoin network is artificially and heavily constrained such that average confirmation times are taking days, at which point, most everyone else would consider the network in a failed and broken state.
Stuck transactions can easily and safely be handled by a standard timeout. No need to form a new transaction that spends to different outputs.

@_date: 2016-01-15 15:24:03
Dude, there should only be one reason a transaction takes over 48 hours to confirm and that is because you didn't set a reasonable fee. In any other case, having an *expected* 48 hour mempool backlog is a symptom of a heavily broken network. The 48 hour penalty is a stupid tax for failing to provide a fee.
I have zero interest in a bitcoin network where the average confirmation time for reasonable fee bearing transactions is over ten minutes.
Stop pretending a 48 hour backlogged mempool is a reasonable and expected state for the network to be in.
Being able to reverse payments with RBF is a stupid idea.

Blocking includes spreading propaganda against it.  With a 95% activation rate, Segwit requires the full buy-in from the entire community.  Which was a fair place to start.
You do realize that bitcoin as digital-gold largely managed through custodial accounts does not need Segwit, or BU, or any additional scaling at all.
So, if the community refuses to come to any consensus (and spreading conspiracy theories, lies, and disinformation doesn't help) then we will be stuck what 1mb forever and it will likely never work as a payment network.
Oh well, you can always use litecoin instead.

While there is certainly a bit of an 'echo chamber' effect happening here, nevertheless, much of the news is, well, actual news.  I have a Google News alert for 'bitcoin' as well as a number of other search terms.  For example, I have a news alert for the company I work for (a very large tech company) as well as some topics which interest me such as 'scientology' (I always like to keep track of what this cult is up to), and I get an order of magnitude more news alerts for bitcoin than I do any other topic.  As well, the source of those alerts has switched from bitcoin 'news' sites, to much of the mainstream financial media and, more importantly, has significantly switched from negative to positive reporting.
What certainly is true is that the user base of bitcoin does not seem to be growing relative to all of this 'news' and 'acceptance' of the currency.
Until that happens, and we address the scalability issues, all of this other stuff ultimately doesn't matter much.  We need more adoption by the general public (which seems to have slowed to a crawl) as well as support for a higher transaction volume.
Sadly, the thing which is going to drive more user adoption is probably a significant increase in price.  It seems to be simple human psychology that people want to jump in if they feel like they are 'missing out', but the price has been depressed for over a year now, and that is probably significantly affecting user adoption.

Agreed.  I would never use the LN for anything other than 'pocket change'.
I might open a LN channel for say $100.  And that would be big enough to handle all the cups of coffee transactions I should ever need to do.
I would never receive my paycheck or any large payment over LN.
I do not think the LN is particularly useful for large value transactions.
But, let's look at what it is good for.
* It can offload the vast majority of all transactions on the network today for low value payments
* Instant confirmation 
* Enables all kinds of micro-transaction use cases that would never have been economically feasible on any other payment network.  Send value for the cost of a few electrons zapping over the Internet
* Very low fees
Get it?
High value transaction happen on the main blockchain.
Low value transactions, walking around money, on LN.
If we reach a point where there are so many high-value transactions on the main network that it, too, is clogged, there are options.  Hopefully by then well secured decentralized sidechains will be in existence or we will find safe ways to increase on-chain transaction capacity.  But that's a problem 'down the road'.
Right now the bitcoin network is clogged with low-value payment transactions. Those are what need to be moved to LN.

Well, the obvious one is that it puts the complete unilateral control of the network in the hands of a single person.

The Chinese government can institute full AML/KYC requirements and blacklists on miners.
Miners can, and will, collude to modify the main consensus parameters to increase their monopoly, shutting out all competitors.
It will, obviously, lead to massive centralization of not just mining, but node operators as well.

Yet another person who repeats the false premise that the bitcoin network can support 50 million users with 1MB blocks.
And, yet once again, treats the LN as a 'given' when it will take years for it to be fully deployed and adopted throughout the entire ecosystem; and that assumes everyone is willing to commit 99.99999% of their transactions to a, currently, non-existent system which has not had years to gain trust and users.
LN is a great idea, but it is years away from being able to function as promised and may have systemic failures that prevents it from every fulfilling its promise.

It would be a whole lot more helpful if we would all discuss realistic scenarios and time frames.  Virtually all of my criticism of LN has been based on the fact that people are repeating exaggerated claims and timelines.
In my view this is not a binary thing.  To scale bitcoin will require both on-chain and off-chain scaling.  And since off-chain scaling isn't going to exist in a form capable of off-loading even 50% of transactions for quite some time, we should probably start scaling on-chain *now*.
@_date: 2016-01-17 23:11:41

LN nodes are collecting fees for transactions the miners cannot process.  Miners are going to process transactions for fractions of  penny that pay fees on the order of 1/1000th of a penny?
I think not.  LN is a micro-transaction engine.
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:47:01
I don't necessarily see it as a big issue since people will always be able to still use the bitcoin network directly should they choose to. But the size of the problem from the perspective of the state is much smaller.

I don't think anyone is saying 4mb blocks would be the death of bitcoin. Segwit provides a doubling of transaction capacity now. In contrast, BU has 256mb blocks and breaks the consensus mechanism of the network. So hardly a viable option.

@_date: 2017-03-26 04:10:48
I want to debunk this myth that the miners can already do this.
It is true that a couple of large mining pools could collaborate to perform a 51% attack on the network with different consensus rules.
However, if they tried to do this, the economic majority would respond to this attack with great force and vigor (what is happening right now with the BU hardfork attack).
However, if BU were the accepted client, such a change to consensus rules could be done without it being considered an attack, and with no involvement from the economic majority or recourse.
This is an important distinction.
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:32:48
Yeah.  Ver's response to my question of why he is blocking segwit was why are we blocking BU.  It's hopeless.  Because long-term holder/investors don't even need segwit or on-chain scaling.
If the COIN ETF launches, that alone could bring millions of new bitcoin users into the community.  It doesn't matter if it's in a custodial account.  Frankly, they will prefer it.
Brave bitcoiners wire transferring money to foreign exchanges can't understand why your average trader on Fidelity or Etrade is going to be a lot more comfortable with COIN? I get it.
Bitcoin will continue to scale, through custodial accounts, and grow in value, without segwit.  I want segwit because I want decentralized layer-2 scaling.
On-chain scaling to a VISA like payment network should never happen.  They are hurting their own cause.

A LN transaction is, in fact, a bitcoin transaction. However, it's also a zero confirmation transaction. Not an ordinary zero confirmation transaction though. This one is backed up, not only by the signatures, but also some game theory.
**EDIT** Some more detail on this topic.
* A LN transaction *IS* a bitcoin transaction.  This is a misconception many people have so it is worth repeating.
* While a LN transaction *IS* a bitcoin transaction, it's also an **unconfirmed** bitcoin transaction.  This distinction is important too.
* While a LN transaction is an unconfirmed bitcoin transaction, it's not an ordinary zero confirmation transaction.  It is one which is enforced by smart contract rules and time verification.
The details about how these smart contract rules are enforced are complex and wide open for debate.
A few things from my own personal perspective:
* I would never claim that a LN transaction is 'as secure' as a confirmed bitcoin transaction.  There is no reason to believe that.
* I would, however, claim that a LN transaction is more secure than a typical zero-confirmation transaction, due to the smart-contract properties which enforce it.
* I would never claim that the LN is suitable for replacing high-value high security transactions on the bitcoin network.  I am of the personal opinion that the LN is only suitable for handling low-value payments (i.e. &lt;$100), which comprise the vast majority of all transactions on the bitcoin network today.
Something like the LN is probably capable of off-loading the majority of low-value payment transactions that are currently being 'priced out' of the network due to the current fee market.
In addition to this, the LN enables new kinds of economic activity never possible before.  It is capable of sustaining economic activity for massive numbers of high-volume, low-latency, low-value, micro-transactions which could be fundamentally transformative in scope and power.  It is  a truly amazing technology that I think few people have yet grasped the total impact of.
Since the LN requires on-chain transactions to open and close channels, the number of participants is still limited by the current blocksize limit.  This is a real concern, but not necessarily a short term one.
Over the long term, once we are in a situation where even when all low-value payments have been moved to things like the LN, and we find that people cannot even perform high-value payments on the network because bitcoin is so mega-successful that so many people want to use it directly (i.e not through 3rd parties) then, hopefully, by then, well secured and fully decentralized sidechains capable of onboarding more users will have been deployed.
Or, the blocksize limit will have been raised safely to support more users directly on chain.   
These are problems for down the road.  For now, the question is how do we move low-value payments, which do not require the same level of security as high-value transactions, onto a secondary layer.  Things like the LN are an excellent way to achieve that goal.

Great.....so we are all supposed to be excited because we are adding features to bitcoin to make it work like the legacy banking system?
The bottom line is that RBF only has a reason to exist if the bitcoin network is so heavily congested that it can no longer confirm transactions in a timely manner. In other words, if it is in a broken state.
Most of us don't want a broken network.

It is too dangerous to do segwit as a soft fork. It should be done as a well planned and very well tested hard fork with sufficient lead time for developers across the entire ecosystem to revise their software to deal with it.

Dude, if the bitcoin network is taking 48 hours to process your transactions then it is **broken**.  Transactions should be confirmed, on average, every ten minutes.
The only reason for a transaction to be stuck for 48 hours is if you forgot to add a fee (something most bitcoin wallet software these days does automatically).


Once again, if the bitcoin network has not processed a transaction in 48 hours then that transaction was either missing a fee or the network is in a pathological and broken state.  No one, and I mean no one, should 'want' their transaction to take more than 10 minutes to be confirmed.


No, they shouldn't.  So long as their transaction has a sufficient reasonable fee, it should be processed on average in ten minutes.  If it takes substantially longer, then the bitcoin network is **broken** and needs to be fixed.


Just the opposite.  If you are so fucking stupid you sent a transaction with no fee then, lucky you, you know you can get it unstuck in 48 hours.  The 48 hours is penalty for your own stupidity.

It is relevant to note that all core plans include a blocksize increase to accommodate more active users.  Why they are so resistant to doing it now, when they absolutely know it will need to be done if *ever* bitcoin has more than a few hundred thousand users, is the issue.
This is clearly because they want to *FORCE* a fee market and shove low-value payment transactions off of the blockchain *FIRST*.
The problem is, the community doesn't want that.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:15:14

@_date: 2017-03-21 01:01:31
You are wrong about BU. It is not a blocksize increase. It is a radical change to how the network reaches consensus and opens up new avenues of attack. It is highly, highly, dangerous.

According to dozens of articles in mainstream financial press in the past two weeks. Do you have a Google news alert for bitcoin? If not, I recommend you set one up. I'm used to seeing bullish articles from bitcoin 'news' sites but this time the bull is showing up in Forbes and other business Media sources.
I find it all a bit surreal but these things often become self fulfilling. The general narrative is that with the block reward halving of 2016 there is a general expectation that this will produce a doubling of the bitcoin price. 
I have no idea if that is true, but that is the narrative being sold and, I believe, the fuel for current GBTC price going up even when bitcoin price is going down.

Let's say I run a LN node.  And I choose to have my node be synced to more than one blockchain; so it can bridge across them.  And, same thing goes for another guy, and another guy, and another guy.

Roger Ver, and BU are actively blocking it.  They are also the most responsible for spreading a steady disinformation campaign about it.
Were they not doing that, it's hard to say how many of the rest might be willing to move forward.
I'm not saying that means we would get 95% approval, but actively cock-blocking it is certainly not helpful.


An, indeed it is.  But it's not currently functioning as a low-cost, low-fee, payment network.


Yeah, me too. That's why I'm eager to get segwit activated, sidechains and LN deployed.

What you want is what is called a 'stop limit' order, and neither GDAX or Gemini support that yet.  I don't know about other exchanges.  A 'stop limit' order let's you not only set a price to sell it, but also a limit that says 'Sell if it hits this price but...not if..it drops below this price'.  This prevents you from getting hosed by massive dumps.
You can also just write your own script, but that's a bit more advanced.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:16:08


You don't understand how LN works then
* It is not a 'private network'; it's an open source decentralized network just like bitcoin
* It works using smart contracts pegged against existing UTXO's on the bitcoin blockchain; it doesn't work without a blockchain to back it up.

XT, Classic, and now BU, it's all the same thing; a controversial and adversarial hard fork attempt.
If you don't like how bitcoin works, and can't get your BIPs approved and accepted by the community, then go the Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, route.  Create your own alt-coin.
If they want to 'preserve their value', then they can 'pre-mine' their alt with the UTXO set from the current bitcoin network.  Nothing is stopping them.

Price has doubled since the halving. What are miners bitching about? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:07:04
They are against it for two reasons. First, they have been fed a steady stream propaganda (read that lies). They have been told it's not a blocksize increase, they have been told it is risky and dangerous, they have been told you could lose coins, they have been told it won't have any near term affect on transaction capacity.
However, the real reason isn't technical at all. They are simply pissed at core and believe conspiracy theories that Blockstream, and their corporate overlords, are taking over bitcoin. They really believe this. Strongly. And the hurt egos over this are out for revenge.
That's the main reason. Purely political payback. They want to to rip control of the core client back into the hands of Gavin and their perceived "original vision" of Satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:59:06
Or you meet a guy in a shady bar and pay a premium.  Still more cost effective than mining.

Another thing to consider, is if you do not have NDEBUG defined, typically this means that the STL will enable enormous amounts of additional debug testing for all of the containers. This can often have severe performance impacts on code.
Generally speaking, release builds are also supposed to be as perfomant as possible. 
I know in the video game world this is never acceptable, I would imagine a bitcoin full node should​ also be performance sensitive.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:06:39

The LN scales transactions, not users. It requires every user to perform on chain transactions to work. The bitcoin blocksize limit dramatically limits the maximum number of active users. If LN has any hope of being even slightly decentralized, it will require each person to maintain at least four active channels.

A thought.
Roger Ver traffics in conspiracy theories about Blockstream and their source of funding.
Meanwhile​, Ver has reportedly massive bitcoin wealth (almost entirely attributed to the success of the current bitcoin core team and their relentless professionalism in producing high quality code).
If Roger had spent the past two years working with the core team while simultaneously funding his own big block sidechain, can you imagine the state we would be in today?
Roger is not the solution. He is the problem.

If that's all you moderate on, that can work fairly well. Moderating for spam, begging, that helps of course.
Moderating for topic, that seems to create the biggest problem.
If I come here and bash some alt-coin, it will probably stay up. If I promote an alt-coin it will get deleted immediately.

You are correct. Having majority hash power in the hands of one single individual in Communist China who is proposing a 51% hard fork attack on the network is absolutely nothing to worry about.

Show me in the whitepaper where it says the consensus rules should be dynamically modified on the fly by miners alone?
I'm pretty sure the idea is that the entire network, as a whole, agrees to one single set of consensus rules.
If you make it so that the consensus rules can be dynamically modified on the fly this is a fundamental change in how the network reaches consensus.
Maybe it's better if I explain it with this simple example.
Currently, any group of miners could agree to run a hacked client with their own custom rules.
However, if they did so, those clients would be immediately identified as 'attackers' and the community would react to this hard-fork attack.  All participants in the network, developers, exchanges, users, other miners, would all work together to deal with this attack.  (BTW, that is what is happening now with BU.  It is a hostile attack on the bitcoin network!!!)
With BU, any couple of miners can agree to change a consensus metric, on the fly, and no one can do anything about it.  Because it is no longer considered an 'attack' but instead the network working as designed.  The technical community, the users, the exchanges, have no control over this at all.  They must simply accept the outcome because this new 'emergent consensus' system was deployed and became the 'official client'.
Many people, including myself, do not believe the blocksize limit (which controls far, far, far, more than just how many transactions can be processed) should ever be allowed to grow dynamically; and certainly not to obscene levels like 256mb; which is currently allowed and valid under BU.
If this BU HF occurs, it would mean that miners, and miners alone, could dictate at least this one consensus rule which would lead to extreme centralization of the network.  Once this happens it is just one tiny short step away from the Chinese government demanding that all miners in China (representing by far the majority hash power) implement AML/KYC and blacklists.
Let me get back to this point.  BU *allows* miners to set the blocksize limit to 256mb.  They can manipulate the blocksize limit on the fly, which they can and will do to gain advantage over competitors.
Miners are motivated to consolidate their own power and maximize their profits.  They don't care if they raise the blocksize so high that it knocks off their competitors.  To them, that's a feature, not a bug.
@_date: 2016-01-06 13:35:25
So, you use the old 'stuck transactions' dodge? RBF is *not* for clearing stuck transactions. There is another BIP which cleanly and simply fixes this problem.
Valid fee bearing transactions which are not confirmed for days is a sign of a broken network in a pathological state.
RBF has only one purpose, and it is not unsticking stalled transactions. The only purpose for RBF is to support an auction house eBay style bidding war fee market in a highly and artificially constrained network.
RBF is intentionally designed to destroy bitcoin as a payment network. Period.
The only time RBF makes sense is if **in the future** nearly 100% of all payment transactions are being handled by layer-2 networks then and, only then, would RBF be an appropriate BIP.  However, today, when bitcoin is in its infancy and one of it's primary use cases is as an irreversible electronic cash system, adding RBF today would hurt bitcoin irrevocably.
Pushing a 'feature' which intentionally destroys the bitcoin network as a payment system **before** any viable layer-2 networks exist to offload payment transactions is simply sabotage at this point.
Benefit of the doubt...let's say the inventors of RBF thought it was a creative solution to an actual problem.  Well, guess what, the community has spoken and they don't want it.  If it is not removed from core, the community will simply switch to a client which does not have this 'feature' of destroying bitcoin as a payment network.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:26:41
I agree. It is dangerous for bitcoin to ever allow more than two million people to be able to hold value on it directly. Everyone but the wealthy or major companies must go through trusted intermediaries if they want to hold any value in 'bitcoin'.
Once all bitcoin value is held by Coinbase, Circle, and other exchanges, and once a fee market and constrained network capacity only supports the wealthy and major companies will things be set right.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:31:30
Hah hah, several of his scenarios are super bullish.
Segwit doesn't get activated.  Bullish.  Bitcoin as digital gold remains protected and payment transactions continue to happen on centralized secondary layers (i.e. exchanges, Coinbase, etc.)
Segwit does get activated.  Super-bullish.  Sidechains and payment channel networks evolve to take bitcoin to the moon and back again several times.
There is no scenario where BU or some other adversarial hard fork activates that isn't disastrous.

For LN to be implemented cleanly/efficiently, we need Segwit.  At any rate, segwit offers all kinds of features and fixes transaction malleability which is a huge blocker for a lot of future tech.
Also, Segwit offers an immediate blocksize increase.  It offers a lot.  Nearly 100% of the technical community supports it.

I used to think that, I don't think it as much now.  Some things changed for me.  I realized that the demand for cheap on-chain transaction capacity is exponential, and not just from buying mythical cups of coffee. I attended a conference where it was made very clear that if the bitcoin network, the most secure decentralized value transfer network on the planet, was willing to make an unlimited number of cheap (i.e. pennies apiece) transactions available, they would all get used up rapidly for non-monetary use cases.
People want to put inventory in blockchains. Medical records. Purchase orders.  Stock trades.  Deed and title transfers.  Colored-coins.  The list goes on and on.
I think a bump to 2mb would be filled in a day.  4mb two days.  10mb, a week or two later.  So long as miners would fill blocks for pennies a transaction, I truly believe the demand is that massive.
So, realizing that, I don't think actually bumping the blocksize limit by a small amount in the short term accomplishes much.  
What does accomplish a *lot*, are drivetrains, mimblewimble, and payment channels.
So, that's where my head is at these days.
I'm not opposed to the blocksize increase in segwit as a matter of 'compromise' which is what it was intended to be.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:53:35

Because they are actively attacking the network which is holding my value.  I have every right to object to this attack.


They are not trying to 'solve the scaling debate'.  They are participating in an attempt to perform a 51% adversarial attack on the bitcoin network.  That's not trying to 'solve' anything.






Untrue.  Core is the same group of developers who have shepherded bitcoin to the state that it is today.  They are disciplined, professional, conservative, and careful with my money.  I trust them to keep my money safe.  As a software engineer myself, I am impressed by their level of professionalism and the good process that they employ.


BU is an attempt to perform an adversarial 51% hard-fork attack on the network.  A network currently protecting 20 billion dollars worth of value, and not an inconsequential amount of my own personal money.

Transaction fees from increased transaction volume as bitcoin gains adoption by more than just two million users. Increased adoption increases the underlying value of bitcoin.
Constraining the bitcoin network marches towards failure as only two million people can actively use it and, thus, the value of bitcoin will be unable to grow since the network fails to grow.

For your post tax investments, absolutely, you should always just buy and hold bitcoin directly. However, IRA's and 401k's have lots of restrictions which limit what assets you can invest in and how.

Yes, it could be 'soon', 'a long time', or 'never'.  However, if it does get approved I am sure there would be more than sufficient advance warning before it goes live.  It's not like we are going to wake up one morning and COIN will just magically be available for trade with zero advance warning.  The day the approval comes through will probably be a sufficient 'sell signal' for me.  
The SEC isn't going to approve this without public notice, and it's not going to go live ten seconds later.  We should have plenty of lead time to factor it into our trading strategy.

You may be correct, but there are so many guesses and assumptions with that scenario.  I already trade GBTC based on the amount of the price premium today.  If it becomes too far disconnected from bitcoin, I sell, if the premium narrows, I buy.  The problem is that it is has been holding a non-stop steady price premium of over 70% for the past two months.  Which just seems insane to me.  But, it's hard to stay out of it, because as bitcoin goes up, so does GBTC, and it's certainly been a way to really turbo-charge an IRA these past few months.
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:37:44
Kind of...but how do you hedge against bitcoin volatility? As silly as GBTC seems, at least you can buy and sell it during bull sessions and market corrections. This seems like it only offers "hold and forget it" as an option. But maybe I'm wrong.

A slight, but important correction.  SegWit *does* raise the blocksize limit.  It increases both bandwidth and disk storage requirements, equivalent to roughly a 1.8mb blocksize limit.
It uses an accounting trick to fake out the consensus algorithm to treat a 1.8mb block as if it were only 1mb in size but, let's be clear, it *is* a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:26:58
Segwit then secondary layers.
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:09:05
Sorry. You are right. I meant cost basis as far as the IRS is concerned.
@_date: 2016-06-08 16:41:06
The premium is actually 81.3%
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:59:16


Well, 250,000 transactions are still processed daily.  As SegWit rolls out, that will likely rise to over 400,000 transactions per day.
And, if you limit low-value transactions (including those used simply to watermark someone's content), there is plenty of room for many people hold and transact value on the blockchain.


Bitcoin is evolving.  It just doesn't evolve as fast as you want, or necessarily the way you want.  But it is evolving.

The actual mechanism is remarkably complex.  There is this thing called BIT (the bitcoin-investment-trust) which only the very wealthy buy into, with a minimum investment (if I recall correctly) of $25,000.
Well, the guys who manage this found a trick/rule/loophole where if someone has held a security for a certain period of time, it can be repackaged and sold as an ETF-like product.  (This isn't exact language, I'm just trying to give you a rough sketch of the idea).
So, the GBTC shares are a repackaging of holdings from the original BIT investors.  Each share of GBTC is 'supposed' to correspond to 0.0954 bitcoins.  Originally it was 0.1 bitcoins, but the GBTC fund takes a 2% fee annually, so each year the amount of bitcoins per share steadily decreases.
So, back to your question, how does the price track bitcoin?  Well, really it doesn't.  Investors know that each share of GBTC is *supposed* to represent 0.0954 bitcions, even though they can't actually convert the shares to bitcoin in any way and there is no way to actually prove, as far as I can tell, that a share of GBTC reflects actual bitcoin.
It is a bizarre, strange, weird, derivative asset which people have been trading anyway because it is pretty much the only way to get exposure to the price of bitcoin via your retirement account.  There is, technically, a way you can buy and hold bitcoin directly via an IRA, but the process is quite complex to set up.
Most people just want to be able to put in a buy or sell order over their existing ETrade/Fidelity/Schwabb account and, in the US, GBTC is the only thing you can trade today.
The price of GBTC has almost always been higher than the price of the underlying bitcoin it allegedly represents (except for a few brief occasions).  There is absolutely no reason for the price of GBTC to be higher than the underlying bitcoin value.  The only reason it is, is because it's the only vehicle available and it has very low liquidity.
The only shares of GBTC available are those that original BIT investors provide.

Completely subjective, but in my own mind GBTC, as it exists today, might rationally command about a 30% premium since it is the only way to hold bitcoin in a tax deferred status.
For a long time I traded the asset with that thought in mind and, for quite a while, the 30% premium was more or less what we were seeing.  
However, during the bull run of the past couple of months GBTC has been trading at a 60-70% price premium!  Which, frankly, I thought was nuts, so I sold, expecting it to crash back down to a reasonable range.  But, it never did and I ended up losing a ton of profit because of it.
Do I think it's worth a 60-70% premium?  Absolutely not.  But, apparently the market does and while bitcoin is having another big bull run in front of the halving, and the fact is GBTC is the *only* way I can get exposure to that bull-run via my retirement account, I'm back in for now; but watching it very closely.

I cannot say that you made a good decision. I currently hold more than that amount in bitcoin...however...I invested in early 2013 and have already taken out massive amounts in profit, so the money I'm currently risking has a cost basis of zero and if I lose it all, it won't really affect me that much.
However...you are in a different position I assume, where if you lost all of this money it would be devastating to you.
Honestly I think bitcoin is quite likely to do very well over the next year with the halving coming on, but if you reach a point where you can pull out your original investment as profit that might be a wise thing to do.
Your call, you are clearly a gambler.

There is no technical reason. It's simply an an agreed upon limit, enforced by the software, which is run by all participants.

When you open a Lighting Network payment channel, it is done by having two parties fund a single multi-sig transaction.  Either one person, or both, commit a certain amount of bitcoin to create the initial channel.  If only one person commits money, then it is initially a one way channel.  If both parties commit an equal amount of funds, then money can flow back and forth equal to the maximum amount deposited.
Using hashed time locked smart contracts, these two parties can execute a near infinite number of 'transactions' over this channel simply by exchanging signatures indicating the current balance between them.  However, they cannot perform a transaction larger than the amount on deposit.  They also are restricted as to how large a transaction they can perform as the channels become unbalanced. 
This money is 'tied up' in the channel.  The user cannot use the bitcoins dedicated to this channel for any purpose outside of the context of the existing LN system which it has been dedicated to, not without 'closing' the channel, which requires an on-chain transaction to be performed.


The example of $100 is not some hard amount, it simply represents an amount of money the average person **might** be willing to tie up in a payment channel for the dubious benefit of accessing the Lighting Network for 'more efficient' transactions.  To many people, $100 might even be too much money.
$10,000 is definitely a lot of money to many people.  If the purpose of bitcoin, in conjunction with the LN, is to 'help the unbanked of the world', well the 'unbanked of the world' generally don't have $1,000 to their name (much less $10,000).  Tying up a $10,000 worth of capital for the sole benefit of performing 'more efficient transactions' is not going to be something most people are willing to do.  While your money is tied up in a LN payment channel, you are subject to volatility risk.  Most people who use bitcoin for payments, convert it to fiat fairly quickly.  Even though bitcoin is a lot more stable today than it has been in the past, it exhibits relatively high volatility compared to most fiat currencies.
Would the average person be willing to dedicate $100 worth of value to a LN channel so they can more efficiently and cheaply perform micro-transactions on the internet?  Maybe.  Maybe the real number is closer to $20 or $50, but definitely not $1,000 in my opinion (and certainly not $10,000).


Nothing.  And, I think, for relatively small amounts, maybe that won't be a problem.  But...let's say you want to provide liquidity to the LN so you can make money off of your bitcoin by collecting transaction fees.  If you are willing to provide $100 worth of liquidity to 100 people, you would have to tie up $10,000.  But, if you wanted to provide $1,000 worth of liquidity to just 100 people, you would have to tie up $100,000!  To collect minuscule fees and be subject to volatility risk as well as the potential for hackers to game your system which, effectively, acts as a hot-wallet while connected to the LN.


The payment channels only flow relatively smoothly if the value being transacted is substantially smaller than the channel capacity.
So, if you have say a $100 channel, you could send 100 $1 payments before the channel became 'full', or near unbalanced, that can provide a 100x scaling of one-chain to off-chain transactions.  However, if you wanted to send just a single $100 payment, your channel would instantly be completely full and unable to transact more value.  
The fact that the LN requires a substantially greater amount of capital dedicated to a channel than the average transaction size, means that at a practical level it is only suitable for relatively low value payments.
Higher value payments would, and should, happen 'on-chain'.


Let's say you open a channel with $200 but you use it to send two $100 payments.  After just two payments the channel is completely full and you can no longer send money over it.  The channel has to be substantially larger than your average transaction size for the LN to work smoothly.  For low value, this probably isn't an issue.  However, tying up a lot of money to a channel simply so you can use the LN to do a high-value payment, does not seem practical.


That would work fine, but you would have to tie up a $1,000 simply so you can send $100 payments off-chain.  Maybe you are wealthier than most people, and can dedicate a $1,000 worth of value indefinitely simply for the convenience of using the LN as a payment system but, I think it's fair to say, most people will not be willing to do that.


Yes, that seems reasonable to me.


It's more complex than that.  For any transaction capacity you 'free up' by moving low value payments to the LN, that 'freed up' capacity can, will, and should, **immediately** be filled up by **new users** coming online.  
Realize that 'scaling bitcoin' does't just mean supporting more payment transactions.  Equally importantly, arguably, most importantly, it means supporting **more people**.  Each LN channel requires on-chain transactions, therefore every time a new user enters the ecosystem, they create additional transaction load.
It is worth noting that if, today, you quantify a 'small transaction' as under $5 worth of value, then far less than 50% of all transactions processed by the bitcoin network today are that small.  Meaning, even if you can off-load 50% of all transactions from the bitcoin network and move them over to the LN, the remaining higher value transactions are still there and, as previously mentioned, that 'freed up space', can (and should), immediately get filled up by **new users**, which is the long-term goal for everyone in the bitcoin space.
@_date: 2016-06-11 15:00:26


Yes, it is different.


Because it can only be used via the LN.  You are locked into a single payment rail.  You are also locked into the amount of value dedicated to that channel.  If you want it to become 'unlocked' you have to perform a settlement transaction on the main chain, which comes with both a time delay (which could be significant) as well as possibly a high fee.
So, you can 'get the money out' but not without some time and fee penalty.  If you want your money 'now' having to wait for the settlement transaction to clear could certainly be considered an inconvenience.


No, you can only spend it on the LN, which is likely to be highly limiting.  You may be envisioning some hypothetical future where the LN is a mainstream payment network that every person in the world uses and accepts and, sure, if that were the case it would be less limiting.  However, that's a hypothetical future.  Today, you can send money to anyone anywhere in the world so long as they install a bitcoin wallet.  Now, that person may neither want nor accept bitcoin, which greatly limits the utility of bitcoin of course.  Yet, requiring someone to create a LN channel, large enough to accept your payment, would be a much higher barrier to entry.


Correct, and this is one of the biggest problems with the LN.  These varied amount of value in channels makes payment routing extremely difficult and complex and creates frequent situations where they is no way to pay someone because the channel connecting the parties has insufficient capacity.


By 'small' I mean the amount of value someone would be willing to tie up in a dedicated LN channel for the sole purpose of getting access to the network.  The LN is a value proposition.  The bitcoin network works today absolutely perfectly for all use cases except for extremely small amounts of value.  It is a great deal of additional effort and complexity for someone to use the LN.  People are not going to be willing to tie up significant amounts of money to a LN channel for receiving very dubious benefits.  For the user, or the network as a whole, to achieve any significant scaling benefits means the channels must be funded at large multiple of the average transaction size (otherwise it would just become almost immediately full and unbalanced, which would make it useless).
 &gt;So I think you are saying that for people who have holdings that are significantly larger than their daily, monthly, or yearly spending, that they would be able to avoid Blockchain transactions using the Lightning Network, but others would not?
I think it's a giant leap of faith to think that a large number of people would be able or willing to dedicate significant amounts of value, as well as liquidity providers matching that value so that the channel is bi-directional, for long periods of time.  First of all, most people don't have that much money to dedicate up front.  You also cannot perfectly predict how large a channel you will ever need over a given period of time.  The LN payment channels are unforgiving.  They have a certain amount of capacity before they become 'full', or are unbalanced, or cannot find a feasible network path due to widely varying channel capacities.
For the low-value use case, this is less of a problem.  As the amount of value you want to send over the network increases, the limiting effects of these various sized and unbalanced channels makes the network overly complicated.
And, all for what purpose?  On chain transactions for large value payments work fine and have none of these issue?
I see the valid use case for the LN if you want to send a thousand transactions for pennies apiece.  Using the LN to send large amounts of money is limiting, difficult, impractical and, at the end of the day, unnecessary.  The main bitcoin network handles large value payments, where the fee is negligible versus the value being transmitted, very well already.


Correct.  Trying to 'predict' how big of a channel you are ever going to need at any given time is never going to work.  And, your only solution is to 'guess high', which is impractical.
Another thing you should be aware of is that if you are using the LN, then the software you are using will behave as a 'hot-wallet', capable of automatically signing transactions to forward them throughout the network.  Best practices for digital currency is that you only leave a relatively small amount of value in a hot-wallet.
If a hacker got a virus installed on a machine running the LN, they could easily redirect all of your funds to another party.  


Is this a serious question?  Do you not know what 'volatility risk' is?  The price of bitcoin fluctuates dramatically relative to more established fiat currencies.  Today, most people accepting bitcoin for payment do not actually hold bitcoin.  They immediately convert it to fiat to limit their volatility risk.  With the LN, if someone wants to accept a significant and large number of payments, they must open a channel large enough to accommodate that level of economic activity.  For the duration that this channel is open the bitcoin is 'locked up' in the channel, and only accessible if the user commits a closing transaction; which is time delayed.


They are risking having bitcoin tied up in a payment channel in the event of a major market correction.


Once again, I find i hard to believe this is a serious question.  Do you not know that hackers take over people's computer systems all of the time and steal things?  The best practices for bitcoin is that only small amounts of money is ever kept in a 'hot-wallet', meaning a bitcoin wallet that is actively connected to the Internet.  Larger amounts of value are, and should be, stored offline using secure methods.
To participate actively in the LN requires that participants have a hot-wallet.  If you have a relatively low value channel, this is probably acceptable risk.  However, if you had a large amount of value tied up in a LN, as did hundreds of thousands of other people, this would create a massive target for hackers world-wide to create viruses which would infect people's computers and redirect funds to their own accounts.
This already happens today on a constant and regular basis.  Exchanges are hacked.  People's computers are hacked.  This is a real, legitimate, and high risk.  It would not be wise to tie up large amounts of funds to a LN hot-wallet in my opinion.


What is 'confusing' about saying risking $100 is significantly less of a problem than risking $1,000?


Reality and common sense suggests that $10,000 is objectively high value to most people.  


Sure, but you just put $100,000 at risk to a network that could be hacked, and good luck finding any other participants who could handle transacting that much value.


No, I mean high-value relative to the risk vs. benefits using the LN.  Realize that the bitcoin network handles high-value transactions just fine.  We don't need the LN for high-value transactions, it's only benefit comes from a huge number of small payments to keep fees small.  


This statement doesn't make sense.  People use payment networks.  If a payment network, for example, can only process 10 transactions per day, then either one person can preform ten transactions, or 10 people can perform one, but in no case can more than 10 people use the network a day.


What 'system'?  I'm lost here, what are you talking about?


Your question doesn't make any sense.  What I'm talking about is how many individual people can regularly open and close LN channels on the main bitcoin blockchain.  It's not an infinite number of people, it's finite based on the transaction capacity of the network.  Meaning, even if you move all of your payment transactions to the LN still, all of the channel open and close transactions must occur on chain.  The on chain capacity is highly limited and only so many people can use it to open and close LN channels.


I don't know what this sentence is supposed to mean.

The price rise simply confirms that miners will keep being well compensated after the halving and they are getting a bonus the few weeks prior to it.
Anyone trying to spread FUD about the halving is doing just that, spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt. I think mostly so financial rags can create a compelling narrative. The halving presents zero risk, it has been known about and planned for for four years. The price is responding nicely.
We survived massive collapses in the price in the past without disaster to the network. So, while we are in a bullish period, there is zero reason to think the halving presents either a technical or economic risk.

Also, that requires you to hold until capital gains tax applies (which from what I read is one year, not two).

I limit my exposure to GBTC by buying and selling it based on the current price premium. 
This strategy has worked well for me, but I would have made a lot more money had I never traded it all, meaning just bought and held.
However, I still feel like it should have some relationship to the underlying asset.
By selling when I feel the premium is too high (thus protecting my gains) and buying when the premium shrinks, I feel like I'm limiting my risk and I have a fairly large buffer to get out of my position in the event of a major correction.
All that said, I have very little experience as a trader so this is just one strategy, probably not the best, but I've become comfortable with it.

* The price of bitcoin would increase due to the 'civil war' being over, progress being made on scaling, enabling of layer-2 solutions, smart-contract and scripting improvements, and transaction malleability finally being fixed. It's probably a safe bet that if SegWit were activated, enabling all of the improvements to bitcoin it promises, that the price of bitcoin would increase substantially, and the block-reward is still how miners make most of their profits.

Why would they get settled on the layer-1 bitcoin blockchain?
I don't get why people have so much difficulty understanding this concept.
The purpose of the bitcoin network is to issue the bitcoin token and secure it against all attackers, period.
That is the number one most important role of the bitcoin network; to issue the currency and maintain the security and integrity of the blockchain.
Transactions can, should, and will, occur on other layers using *THE SAME TOKEN*.
Why the fuck should you care if your transactions are processed by some additional layer in the bitcoin ecosystem?  You should no more care about that than you care about how your packets are routed over the internet when you request a web page.

A LN channel ties up money.  Bitcoin is still considered a pretty volatile asset.  Most people will be unwilling to tie up a large amount of bitcoin for an extended period of time and accept the associated volatility risk.  This is just one reason of many.
The main reason has to do with how the LN works.  The LN uses bi-directional payment channels which simply shift money on a balance sheet between two parties.  
This means a few things.
* The largest amount of value you can transfer over a payment channel is equal to the size of that payment channel.  So, for example, if your payment channel was opened with let's say $100 worth of value, but you want to send $101 dollars worth of value, you cannot.
* Payment channels require both parties to commit money if the users wish it to be bi-directional; meaning to both receive and send money.  If, for example, you open a payment channel with $100, but the other party commits $0.  Then you can send up to $100 worth of value (until the channel becomes full) but, until you send money, you  cannot receive any.  
* Channels become unbalanced.  Once you have either sent or received any funds, this further limits how much more money you can continue to send or receive over the channel while it is unbalanced.  To rebalance a channel, may require closing and reopening it, causing a transaction to occur on the main chain.
* If you open a LN payment channel for say, $100 worth of value, but you only use it for low value payments (let's say less than $5) then you can send 20 $5 payments before the channel is full.  Moreover, you should be able to replenish/rebalance your channel.  So long as the payments you intend to make are a small multiple of the total size of the channel, then the LN works pretty well.  If you wish to send payments nearly the size of the channel, it falls apart quickly.
For this, and a whole host of other even more complex reasons, it is not realistic to expect something like the LN to handle large payments.
For the micro-transaction use case (transactions measured in thousandths of a penny worth of value) the LN is one of the most amazing inventions ever; opening up new kinds of economic activity previously impractical ever before.
For relatively low value payments, say less than $5, it could work very well.
For higher value payments, it has numerous issues, due to unbalanced channels and the quantity of capital which would need to be tied up in them.
This isn't a problem right now.  Today 35% of all transactions on the bitcoin network are for less than $5 worth of value.
The LN could become an amazing payment network for relatively low value transactions (the proverbial 'cup of coffee') and also enable a whole new world of economic activity never possible before (true high-frequency micro-transactions), but it does not appear practical or suitable for high value payments for a whole host of reasons.

Yeah, this it the same question I have.  When I 'deposit' bitcoin into my GDAX account it doesn't prompt me to enter the 'cost basis'.
Having them report erroneous data to the IRS is going to be a nightmare.
If they compute the cost basis as the USD price when I deposited, obviously that would be wildly to my advantage, essentially Coinbase helping me commit tax fraud.  So, clearly, they gotta figure this thing out.
Similar issues come up if you frequently take your bitcoin on and off the GDAX exchange (something many people do for security reasons).  Each time you pull it off and put it back on, that would disrupt any cost-basis calculations they have going on.

Fair enough.  I've brought up the topic of 'condescension' with this group.  It's exacerbated by the fact that there is no such thing as an 'official PR' group for bitcoin.  Instead it's an ad-hoc collection of social media platforms, some of which are downright pathological.

The premium price will evaporate in an instant and, there is a chance, GBTC will actually drop in value below the corresponding bitcoin price if people perceive the COIN ETF is a vastly superior vehicle (which it likely will be as it will track the actual price of bitcoin directly and have much more liquidity).
The instant we know this ETF is going to happen, I will sell all of my GBTC.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:40:56
Yeah, same thing here.  I have a little spreadsheet that I maintain which tracks the price premium of GBTC.
It shows the effective bitcoin price of GBTC and the price premium as a percentage.
I also made a different spreadsheet which showed the price premium of GBTC over time since it's inception, and I tried to interpret some general trends; i.e. how far it deviates before the market usually corrects.
I tried to use this as a guideline for when I should buy and when I should sell.  If the price premium was below a certain percentage, I would go ahead and buy in.  If the price premium deviated too high, I would sell and try to hold profit with the hope of buying back in lower.
This more or less worked, limiting my exposure, for quite a while; but due to low liquidity getting into and out of GBTC at anything approximating a 'market price' is really, really, difficult.
My plan fell apart the past couple of months where the price premium has been over 60% virtually every single day!
Now, with the bull market we are in, I finally just decided that 60% is the new 40%.
Just yesterday, with those articles about bitcoin being 'a new asset class', and recommendations that everyone 'get a little bit' into their portfolio, I figure it will probably stay in high demand for a while.
I've got a lot of cushion where I can still sell and hold onto previous gains, so I'm back in the pool again.
What kills me is if I had simply bought in a 27-30 (as I did originally) and then never touched it (I lost all of my profits trying to bail out of the Hernia in time) I would be up over $200,000 profit!
But, this is all a learning experience for me, so any profit above 10% is probably more than I ever would have realized leaving my investments in some mutual fund.  It's been interesting...to say the least.
I'm hopeful that if any proper ETF launches we will get a pretty significant advance warning.  I think GBTC can probably survive the launch of a competing ETF; but the price premium should vanish immediately.

So, for the past year we have been arguing that a controversial hard fork did not represent the will of the economic majority (meaning people talk with their money).

The main advice everyone here is giving you is the most important. Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.
You must treat bitcoin as a **long term** investment. Think 3-5 years. Anywhere in between, don't worry about the price. 
If bitcoin is even still a 'thing' in 3+ years odds are it will have a healthy return relative to other conventional investments.
That said borrowing money to invest in bitcoin, money you clearly cannot 'afford to lose', was foolish.
Fortunately for you bitcoin is on a bull run today. So sell now, take your few percent profit, and pay off your second mortgage!

Don't think that this might not affect bitcoin for a while too.  The mainstream press does an excellent job of lumping everything into one pile.
I don't want to be an 'I told you so' kind of guy, but I debated with Vitalik when Ethereum was being designed and I told him then that a smart contract system which was built from 'hard coded contracts with very fixed rules' was probably better/safer than a completely wide open programming language.

@_date: 2017-08-15 21:01:19


Because people would be unable and unwilling to commit large amounts of value to create a fully decentralized mesh network.
Say you want to send up to $5,000 on your channel.  Well, you *need* $5,000 worth of bitcoin on that channel.  Or, someone else has to commit that much value.  This will lead to a hub-and-spoke centralized configuration of the network.  To keep it decentralized, you might need 4 channels.  So you would need to do 4 on-chain commit transactions; I suppose you could spread that $5k across the four channels; but you are going to end up with routing problems.
Either way, it is a lot of money to commit simply so you 'could' send that much money.  If you need to send more than that, you cannot.
This will tie up enormous amounts of capital in unbalanced channels simply to keep open capacity for something that 'might be used'. 
It's similar to a problem of memory fragmentation with a memory allocator.  
When memory becomes fragmented; after repeated allocations and de-allocations, you reach a point where you could have a machine with lots of memory but fail to be able to perform a single contiguous allocation.  In a similar way, unbalanced LN channels will constrict the flow of money and lead to the inability to do monetary transactions.
As channels become more and more unablanced, it limits the flow of money.
The biggest issue is just how much capital has to be tied up to account for the **maximum** amount of money you **might** want to send at some point.
For these reasons, to me, it only seems practical for very low amounts of value; on the order of like $10, $20 or so.
If hundreds of millions of people each wanted a channel that might accommodate as much as say $5k, do the math, it is an insane amount of bitcoin would have to be dedicated to keep the channels open.
Additionally, there are numerous security concerns with using the lightning network.  To be a full participant in the LN (in an effort to keep it decentralized) then your node would have to be open and running 24/7.  This is the same as keeping a hot-wallet open on your computer at all times.  This would be a hacker honey pot to attack.
There are many, many, issues with the LN at scale that have not been addressed.  To be fully decentralized every participant would need at least 4 channels open; not one.  Due to the fact that people cannot accurately estimate how much money they might need to transfer at any given time, due to security concerns, and due to unbalanced channels, frequent on-chain transactions will still be necessary.
There is a myth that people will open 'one channel forever' and never need to do another on-chain transaction again.  This is completely false and inaccurate and not how the network can, will, or should function.
The LN can be a killer app for micro-transactions (millions of transactions for a fraction of a penny) but using it to do large amounts of value transfer simply does not work in my view.

So, here's my opinion.  The 'other side' has now become so entrenched in their view that they are no longer interested in **any** compromise.
Their goal now is to completely take control of the development branch away from the current core team.
If it was just about 'doubling the transaction capacity', they would accept Segwit.
Since there is currently no base blocksize increase even on the roadmap, this segment of the community feels betrayed and no longer holds any trust in the core roadmap or position.
Frankly, it seems like a complete stalemate to me at this time.

Yes. Bitcoin is a success. It's almost impossible to change when there is a conflicted community. As by design.
Meanwhile, it keeps processing transactions daily and trades on exchanges worldwide.

The LN is **capable** of being fully decentralized.  That doesn't mean it will be, but it **can** be. 
If every single person who uses LN has, let's say, an average of 4 channels open, then the network can form a configuration known as a 'decentralized mesh network' without any centralized hubs.
Now, in reality, it may be the case that LN does tend to have points of centralization.  However, I tend to believe people will only be using LN for low value transfer; relatively small amounts of money, which has never been a major concern by the state anyway.
The state is going to care if you are moving millions of dollars around the world, but $5, not so much.

@_date: 2017-08-24 18:28:35
What the actual fuck? Segwit is for LN *only*? This is insane, especially after years of being told the opposite.
I 'get' what Luke is talking about here.  He thinks the blocksize should be smaller to begin with.  That's an opinion he has that not everyone shares.
However, the argument against Segwit2X and an argument presented here for years is that Segwit offers a near doubling of on-chain transaction capacity.  It was supposed to give us 'runway' until layer-2 solutions come online.
Also, LN offers very little scaling of additional users of bitcoin because every single user of LN must be able to perform on-chain transactions; at a reasonable cost and without a major delay in confirmation.
The number of individuals who can actually use LN is deeply gated by the base blocksize.
It's also important to note that the primary transactions which will occur on the LN will be for relatively low amounts of value.
These are **not** transactions we are moving off of the main bitcoin network because the main bitcoin network hasn't been usable for low-value transfers in quite some time!
The main network is being used for moving large sums of money to and from exchanges where a $3 fee is acceptable.
So, it's not like LN is somehow going to reduce demand for on-chain transactions in fact, if anything, it will increase them!

This is only true for very small amounts of value. Also, if a LN is to be even slightly decentralized, then every participant should have roughly four channels open, not one, so it can form something more closely modeling a mesh network and less hub and spoke.
For the low value use case, LN makes lots of sense. Most high value payments will still happen on chain.
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:50:47
Here's another way to put this. Let loose your wildest conspiracy theories. Imagine that the bitcoin community were infiltrated by numerous undercover agents of various intelligence agencies with the goal to subvert or change bitcoin to be more friendly to the state.
Now, I'm not saying this is happening. I've seen no evidence of it. Every person I have encountered at these conferences appear to have their absolute most sincere interest in seeing bitcoin succeed. 
However, in the event of such an attack on bitcoin, via infiltration and political manipulation, the fact that bitcoin is **enormously** difficult to change is probably one of its greatest strengths.

@_date: 2017-01-05 22:04:33
Here's probably the best way to look at it.  If you are 'long' on bitcoin (meaning you are in it because you hope/expect it to grow in value by more than 10x in the future), then your goal is not to get the highest dollar value in your portfolio in the short term; your goal is to get the maximum number of bitcoins possible.
The easiest way to acquire more bitcoin is simply to buy (or work) for them over time.
The more challenging way to acquire more bitcoin is to try to trade them.  However, most traders end up losing bitcoin rather than gaining more.
In retrospect it always looks easy.  Why didn't everyone sell at $1166 and buy back at $900?  This would have greatly increased the number of bitcoins they hold.  
Well, that is easier said than done.  Over on the trading subreddit it is littered with the corpses of wanna be day-traders who all say they would have more bitcoin today had they never traded at all.
Simply holding your bitcoin, and buying more over time to dollar cost average, is the safest surefire way to increase the size of your portfolio.
Unless you are a very experienced trader, trying to make optimal trades to acquire more bitcoin is extremely difficult to do.
What usually happens is people trade to maximize their USD 'profit', but end up with fewer bitcoin than they started with.

That slide-deck makes assumptions which do not match in any way real-world operation.  I have pointed that out to the authors and their response was, yeah, it was just something we threw up there as a placeholder.  They realize the numbers are bogus, but that doesn't prevent people from repeating the slide over and over again.
The slide deck assumes that people will only ever need to open one channel.  This is false. It leads to a centralized hub-and spoke model.  Authors of the LN have proposed that each LN participant has at least 4 channels open, not one, to keep the network in at least a semblance of a distributed mesh configuration.
It doesn't take into account on-chain transactions to rebalance channels.  It doesn't take into account transactions that are too big for the LN.  It doesn't address the amount of capital tied up if it were ever to be used for large value transfer.
The slide assumes that 100% of the entire bandwidth of the entire bitcoin network is consumed with nothing else than opening and closing LN channels.  No other activity of any kind. 
In a situation where the network is heavily congested, as it is now, as you can see people already need to wait days to get a transaction confirmed.
If you plug in the numbers described in that slide, the average wait time for a new user to open a LN channel would be measured in **MONTHS** if not years. 
The slide also assumes massive, massive, massive, block sizes which is not the plan-of-record.  The current plan is to not increase the bitcoin blocksize, beyond segwit, probably forever.

The one feature of Mycelium that keeps me using it is the ability to create a single spend transaction from cold-storage.

At the time GBTC was extremely illiquid.  You couldn't get in or out of a position at anything approximating market price.
It's a really bizarre asset and when you can just buy BTC directly and hold it, that just makes more sense to me.  I feel more comfortable holding other investments in my 401k.

I would imagine in the case of a stock split the cost basis is split down the middle and the acquisition date is the same.
But, I don't know that for a fact, it just makes common sense.  I can definitely see the argument to treating it the same as a stock split, on the one hand, but on the other hand a coin split produces two independent securities which is distinctly different than a conventional stock split.

You need to understand that any open crypto-currency system has to be capable of standing up to all forms of sustained attacks.  Bitcoin has been hardened for years against attacks and continues to evolve in a highly hostile ecosystem.
One obvious weakness in BCH is the fact that is has low fees.  I know the BCH crowd thinks low fees are great, but actually they are not.  Low fees are an attack vector.  Bitcoin used to support zero-fee transactions in the past, until repeated spam attacks forced it to change.
If you are thinking adversariallly, and you should always be thinking adversariallly when it comes to an open network, you must welcome, explore, and defend against all forms of possible 'attacks'.
Here's what gets me.  What I don't understand is why the BCH crowd has not gotten 100% fully behind IOTA?
IOTA has **zero fees**.  Forever!!  It has infinite scaling!
Now, the big question with IOTA is whether or not they have fully thought through all possible attack vectors but they have certainly thought more about it than BCH devs have done.
If you care about scaling and low fees, then you should be researching IOTA.  I think bitcoin is here to stay as the new 'digital gold', but that doesn't mean it can, or ever will, be the micro-transaction and payment network winner world-wide.  That crown might go to IOTA or other networks that turn the entire concept of a blockchain inside out!

Not really. Luke is asking people not to use the increased capacity available; which is unreasonable.
We have been telling everyone who will listen for years that Segwit offers a near doubling of on-chain transaction capacity.  Now he says 'don't use it', which is absurd.
There is some serious, serious, magical thinking about LN right now.
Let me make this clear.
LN does not remove **any transactions** we see on the bitcoin network today and, in fact, it **increases** transactions!
LN enables the ability to send low-value payments quickly.  This is awesome.  It is super cool.  We should all want it.
However...and this is very important...**no one is using the bitcoin network today for low value transactions**!
When people are paying $3+ fees for a bitcoin transaction, let's be clear, they aren't using bitcoin to 'buy cups of coffee'.  They are using it to transfer wealth, and a lot of it. 
For a $3 fee to be justified, you need to be sending a lot of value.
The kinds of transactions which are enabled by the lightning network are transactions which are already priced out of the bitcoin network today!  The LN offers **NO TRANSACTION RELIEF**.  None, zero.  It enables new kinds of economic activity; which is awesome, and cool, and wonderful.  But it most certainly does not reduce transaction pressure from the network today which is already full from users moving massive amounts of value.
Are you going to use the LN to move your money to and from exchanges?  I don't think so.  I don't think anyone will.  The LN is for moving small amounts of value, not large value transfer.

@_date: 2017-08-21 14:52:38
Just a gentle reminder.  LN does not enable 'billions of users'.  It enables tens of millions, at best.  Which is great, don't get me wrong, but we don't help ourselves with this level of extreme exaggeration.
If we wish to onramp 'billions of users' we will either need an extensive network of sidechains (my preferred solution) or radically increase the bitcoin blocksize (not a fan).
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:47:22


I wasn't saying it like it was a 'bad thing'.  I agree that access to the network should not be extremely inexpensive.  It's just that we don't have a good mechanism for people to adapt to a fee-market right now and, at a certain point, fees are too high and delays are too long to force most users to other networks.
If those 'other networks' were sidechains pegged to the main bitcoin network, or the LN, this would be a *very good thing*.  Unfortunately, there is no way for the bitcoin network to move transactions off to a second layer at this time.  Which means, users are forced to either centralized 3rd party systems which don't operate 'on-chain', or to an alt-coin .


Define 'low-fee'?  To completely fill the entire transaction capacity of the network, even with relatively 'low fees', still costs thousands of dollars.  No 'kid running a script' could afford to do that.
In fact, it doesn't require the kid fill that much if the entire network is already saturated with normal 'real' traffic.  Then the kid only has to submit a fraction of the 1mb limit worth of transactions to push things over the edge into a continual backlog.
If the blocksize limit were 2mb, it would cost a great deal more money to perform a spam attack.
The bitcoin network has been limiting low-fee, and zero fee, transactions as an anti-spam measure for a long time.
It's all just a matter of what your definition of a 'low fee' is and how many transactions are required to saturate the network.  Actually, a 2mb blocksize limit would help with this, because it would make launching a spam attack much more expensive.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:19:32

It's not stealing if you find a "loop-hole" in the contract.
@_date: 2016-06-01 23:57:54


Here's the honest answer.
Today about 37% of all bitcoin transactions are for less than $5.
About 12% of all transactions on the network are for less than 50 cents.
And, surprisingly, between 1-3% daily are for less than 4 cents worth of value!
Here is a graph which shows the daily breakdown of the value of transactions by percentage over the entire lifetime of the bitcoin network.
What this tells us, is that things like the LN are capable of offloading approximately 40% of all transactions from the bitcoin network once it is fully adopted.
This is great, simply fantastic, but it's no single solution.
What makes matters more complicated, is that we are talking about how many **people** can use the bitcoin network.  Even users of the LN must perform on-chain transactions, in a timely manner, to be able to open and close channels.  This creates new on-chain pressure if we want to onramp more users; even if all of their low-value payment transactions happen off-chain.
Increasing the blocksize, whether it is by the adoption of SegWit or just bumping the blocksize outright, doesn't help all that much.
The problem at hand, is how few people actually actively use the bitcoin network today, versus the number of people on the planet earth.
Obviously, this commercial is targeting the general unbanked population of the world, measured in **billions** of people.
The bitcoin network, in it's entire lifetime since day one, has only processed a few hundred million transactions since 2009.
To support more than a few million active users, even if all low value payment transactions are moved off-chain, would require a massive blocksize increase.  If we wanted to support a hundred million people, or a billion people, the increase in blocksize would be astronomical.
The good news, none of this is really a problem today.  We don't have a billion, a hundred million, or even **one million** people trying to regularly perform on-chain transactions today.
The point is, if bitcoin is to grow to support more people, **many** more people, then neither the LN nor a modest increase in the blocksize limit accomplishes that goal.
I am still of the opinion that if two-way pegged sidechains ever became a real 'thing', then it might be one avenue to onramp more users without putting on-chain transaction pressure.

For real?  I have asked in the past and was told only very select ETF's and customers got that privilege.
"Now theoretically, it is true that you can convert your GLD shares to physical gold and take delivery of it. But practically, you can’t. For one thing, you have to be approved to do so (generally meaning, you’re either a broker or a market maker), and then you have to redeem a minimum of 100,000 shares. And even if you meet those qualifications, buried in the firm’s prospectus – a very tough read, by the way, but you can get a copy at their website if you want to try your luck – is a provision stating that they have the option of redeeming such shares in cash equivalent rather than bullion."

Obviously not.  The analogy is not apt.  By definition any 'secure network' must be hardened against all forms of attack.
Would you suggest we all create crypto-currency networks and just ask everyone to please, just pretty please, don't attack it, game it in any way, pretty, pretty, please?
That's not how it works.


Absolutely fucking bullshit and you know it!  BCH was an attempt to hijack the bitcoin 'brand' and 'value' by stealing it's UTXO set.
Furthermore, the idiotically stupid EDA is acting as an attack against the bitcoin network; an attack which the network will adjust and adapt to, as it has to.
But don't be fucking coy.  BCH was 100% absolutely head on directly an attack on the bitcoin network.  
And, due to the extreme centralization of BCH combined with the mind-numbing technical incompetence of its development team it will fail.  It is already in the beginnings of a death spiral.

Each share of GBTC originally represented 0.1 bitcoin. However, over time, fees keep eating into it so today one share onky represents about 0.095.
You cannot convert it back to actual bitcoin in any way. The price trades independently of the price of bitcoin and currently people are paying almost a 90% price premium for it. The only justification for the price premium is  because it is the only way to easily get bitcoin exposure in a retirement account (IRA, 401k).
In the past the price premium has disappeared almost overnight leaving investors rekt.
In my view it is simply not worth it. Better to just buy BTC directly and hold it. Once you have held it for over a year it will be eligible for long term capital gains which tax wise isn't that bad.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:00:57

Yes. And I'm not sure that would even be considered an 'attack'. These networks function on a set of game rules. That is a perfectly valid way to play the EDA game. BCH is an attack on the bitcoin network due to the EDA thrashing of hashing power and efforts to muddy the brand identity of bitcoin.
It would be entirely reasonable for parties interested in protecting and defending the bitcoin network to use this method to dilute the negative effects of the EDA and hasten the death of that chain.

I think you missed the point.  You should care about the USD value *years from now*, not today.
If you want to make a short term investment in bitcoin to turn a quick profit, go right ahead, but that's a lot more risky proposition than just buying bitcoin and waiting several years; which has always proven to be a winning strategy.

I'm getting a lot of people criticizing my short comment.
It wasn't some in depth analysis or anything. Just an observation that people are dumping BCH and they aren't selling it for USD, most are just dumping it to increase their BTC position.
I don't know anything for sure, it was just an observation.
Also, I would argue that the bitcoin price has been suppressed for a while due to the uncertainty surrounding hard fork drama.
Once that uncertainty was removed I fully expected the market to rebound.
Or, it's just market manipulation as some say. Who really knows? We will have to see where we are in a few weeks.

I don't feel bad. I tried to reason with that community for a very long time. They are like members of a cult who cannot be deprogrammed. Also, their leader has been pumping alts for a long time. If they took his advice and bought DASH or ETH they likely did well. If they sold their BTC for BCH, well they are just speculating. They can manage to prop that alt up for a while.
Realize that even though the price rise in BTC is breathtaking, as a percentage it is still small compared to many alts.
I bought 8k worth of something called IOTA and it tripled in price in three weeks. I just cashed it out yesterday and bought more BTC. And I turned all of my BCH into BTC before this current price spike.
Speculators gonna speculate.

I think the most significant thing about the EDA is the mind boggling stupidity and collosal technical incompetence of it. (For those who don't know, EDA stands for either 'emergency difficulty adjustment' or 'extremely dumb ass', take your pick.)
This was not a surprise. Anyone who thought about this for more than ten minutes would have realized this would happen.
Yet you hear people like Roger Ver attacking the core team for being technically conservative.
Was Garzik in any way involved in this BCH debacle? What about Gavin?
Who all sacrificed whatever little technical reputation they had remaining for this disaster?
EDA will lead, inevitably, to the destruction of BCH. That's a simple fact as the reward keeps halving and fees cannot make up the difference because the fees are miniscule and the network is essentially unusable due to the EDA adjustments.
I have another thought too.
BCH has no long term future. Period. Not while EDA is live for sure. Who is propping up the $600+ price, I have no clue, but they are all going to be bagholders in the end.
By the time Coinbase customers finally receive their 'free BCH' the price may be down to less than $100 and the network nearly dead. I smell a class action lawsuit happening.

One of the things I love about this idea is that the guy who is running the server could actually make a certain amount of 'real money'.  Even though it costs barely pennies to submit even large changes to the page; in aggregate and over time, this could end up being a significant amount of money.  Which is a fantastic demonstration of how microtransactions can produce real revenue in aggregate.

I do not, personally, believe we should ever raise the blocksize limit. I believe exponential scaling should happen on secondary layers. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:41:48
LN channels can be settled on sidechains. Any discussion of scaling must include sidechains.
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:40:10
There seems to be a giant missing hole here; which is the fact that the bitcoin network, in its current state, has an extraordinarily limited capacity.
While it is 'kind of cool' that blocks can be broadcast from a satellite, kind of, I don't see a great deal of value in it when the network fee to submit a transaction is $8 and the network is still highly constrained.
Even if something like the LN existed to take care of relatively low value payment transactions, the current capacity of the bitcoin network is so constrained that still very few people can actually use it.
What good is it to create a satellite system to broadcast bitcoin blocks to the whole world if fees are exorbitant and the capacity incredibly limited?
We are clearly not getting the entire picture here.  
I sent a transaction yesterday with a $1 fee and it still hasn't been confirmed over 24 hours later.  One I sent today with a nearly $9 fee did get confirmed in 10 minutes though; which seemed obscenely high to me.
$9 to send a transaction?  Capacity dramatically limited to a very small number of people?  How does a  satellite network broadcasting blocks in any way solve any of the scaling problems of the network???
We are not getting the whole picture here.  The Lightning Network most certainly is not the solution.  It only works for extremely low value transfer and produces a huge amount of on-chain transaction pressure.  
I was always of the opinion that true scaling would have to come in the form of sidechains and the LN combined.  But LN with the bitcoin network alone, simply does not compute, no matter how many times people keep referencing that highly erroneous slide-deck from a couple of years ago.

@_date: 2017-08-04 15:07:23
This is such a strange position for me.  On the one hand, as the price crashes, I'm 'losing money'.  On the other hand, I'm kind of frankly thrilled that the price is crashing because I'm not a big fan of this whole fork to begin with.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:11:00

@_date: 2017-08-15 17:41:50
I still don't get how this is supposed to work in practice. Fees for a transaction are about $8 and the transaction throughput is incredibly tiny.  I don't see how this satellite business in any way solves those scaling problems.  Seems like someone hasn't thought this all of the way through or we are only hearing a part of the story here.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:20:04
LN does not scale users. It scales microtranactions which aren't even viable on the bitcoin network today anyway.
The transactions which will occur on the LN are transactions no one would be doing on bitcoin anyway. So it doesn't offer any scaling benefit.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:24:57
What's hitting me today is the fact that I no longer feel like I can afford bitcoin any more; which seems like a major milestone.
I remember distinctly in 2013 buying 10 and 20 BTC at a time for $1,000 here or $2,000 there.
Today that won't even buy me half of one bitcoin.
Even if I wanted to dump a massive amount of new investment in bitcoin I might only be able to buy a few.
It really feels like we are entering a whole new phase now.  I didn't think it would feel this different, but it really does.
If this 4k+ valuation lasts, we a truly entering a brave new world.
Previously I always felt like I could wake up one morning and bitcoin could just  crash to near zero. As each day passes that seems ever more remote a possibility. Just too many people have too much skin in the game now.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:50:22
I guess I should have been clearer.  I can't sell my tokens yet anyway.  The exchange I use and am comfortable using, does not yet accept BCH deposits.  So, I can't sell them anyway.  The simple fact of the matter is that whatever 'loss of free money' I have experienced with BCH is already made up by the increase in value of the BTC which, quite frankly, is far more important to me.

That sounds like a reasonable plan.  I expect a lot of volatility over the next few weeks.  The only problem with your plan is this. If you live in the US, by virtue of 'selling all of your bitcoin' you have created a taxable event.  So, if you sold say $100,000 worth of bitcoin, you probably owe roughly $30,000 in state+federal taxes if it was a short term gain; less if it was long term.
That really eats into your profit.

You seem to be missing my point. I am a small blocker. I do not think the blocksize should **ever** increase. I think all transactions by regular users should not happen on the main blockchain.
My question is, what is the plan to accomplish that, because I do not believe, for technical reasons, that the lightning network is the solution to that problem.
It requires other technologies to do it. IOTA​, which may or may not work as advertised, at  least claims to have solved this problem.
I am not advocating for on chain scaling. I think it is a really bad idea. However, I do not yet see a clearly articulated vision for achieving massive off chain scaling either.
Maybe the answer is using something like IOTA. Which would be a shame because I would rather it be based on the bitcoin token.

There already exists a big block hard fork of bitcoin called BCH. We do not need, nor want, yet another hard fork at this time. We should see a substantial increase in transaction capacity with segwit, as well as rapidly enabling layer-2 networks.
Mostly, we don't need the drama. If you guys would just leave bitcoin the fuck alone and let segwit bear fruit we will see a rapidly appreciating price.
If you so desperately want bigger blocks use BCH!!

I have been trading it off and on since it launched. It's a pretty shitty investment vehicle. The moment an actual ETF launches I'm afraid the fair market value of GBTC is going to be near zero, or at least far less than it is priced today.
It has very poor liquidity so it is difficult to get out of a position.
All that said, I did make a lot of money trading it, but as some sort of long-term proxy for bitcoin I think it is not safe. The first time a real bitcoin ETF is launched, or possibly even announced, GBTC will have a major price correction.

IMO it should fail because they already got their hard-fork.  To create yet another hardfork with a blocksize increase so soon would be wildly irresponsible.
We are about to nearly double the capacity of the bitcoin network with segwit.  We do not need any 2X hardfork now.  Not when this BCH hard-fork *just launched*.
Let that dev team add segwit to BCH.  Let them make massive blocks.  Let them fork weekly.  I really don't give a rats ass what they do to BCH.  They just need to leave BTC alone at this point.
The last thing we need is yet another hard fork.

Since fees are essentially free on BCH and they are mining new blocks at an insane rate of speed I'm somewhat surprised no one is spamming the network so that all blocks are 8mb.   
As pointed out by others this would have little effect because BCH is already extremely centralized and has virtually no full node participation.
Probably better would be exploring all of the game theory implications of EDA which is, in fact, like a wobbly washing machine about to explode apart.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:52:18
All I'm trying to say is that we need a clear public and open roadmap for how we scale to the world population.  This announcement does not address that at all.  And, no, the lightning network is *NOT* the answer; as it requires on-chain transactions.

@_date: 2017-08-03 20:59:47

Huh?  I'm lost.  What is the plan to scale bitcoin to hundreds of millions of active users? I missed that.
I am *not* a big-blocker.  I do not think we should grow the blocksize, ever.  I think scaling should come in the form of additional network layers.  However, the LN is *not* a solution to on-ramp hundreds of millions of new users because they all require on-chain transactions (plus a raft of other reasons).
So, what is the plan of record to on ramp hundreds of millions of new users? Other than spawning a shit ton of sidechains, I don't know what the solution is.  And everyone pisses on sidechains whenever you mention them around here.

These were being traded in my 401k, so I would have simply diversified.  I did make money on GBTC, but since it was my retirement money I was being very careful limiting my exposure.
You need to know this though.
Earlier this year when people thought the COIN ETF might launch the GBTC premium completely disappeared!  And very quickly too.
I am simply not comfortable holding an asset so wildly disconnected from the underlying value and with such a massive premium.
Anyone buying today at these prices is gonna get wreckt if/when a better competing product launches; because that premium will vanish overnight.
The bitcoin I hold directly doesn't have these problems and, today, is worth substantially **more** than my 401k I have been investing in for many years.  So, I'll just stick to buying and holding BTC directly.  
My 401k has been heavily in TSLA and NVDA the past year or so, so it's not like I'm hurting.

I don't think you understand how LN works.
The only way someone new enters the system requires an on-chain funding transaction.
People cannot join and participate in the LN without having funding transactions on the main chain.

I'm confident I could give away those USB sticks to anyone and my bitcoin would still be safe.
I spent time teaching my wife how to go through the full round trip process to get at the actual bitcoins.
I'm satisfied with this process. If both me and my wife die, well, those bitcoins will be gone forever.

I agree with you that &lt;$100 in a channel use case is likely ideal for LN.  And, it will absolutely offload a huge number of on-chain transactions as well as enable all kinds of new micro-transaction use cases that were impossible before.
But my original post was focused on how many 'people' can use LN; and that is still gated by on-chain transaction capacity.
The last time I ran some statistics, about 30% of all bitcoin transactions today are for $5 or less.  And about 70% are for $100 or less.  That certainly frees up some transaction capacity to onramp new users; but not enough to make it so that a major population could come on board.
Maybe you get a 3x or 5x gain.  But it's not enough to on-ramp huge numbers of people.  That is why I believe that if you wanted to get 10, 20, 50, 100 million people to use the LN, you can't fit them all onto the existing bitcoin network; it will require sidechains to do that.
However, there's one super cool feature of the LN that not enough people talk about.  The LN can inter-operate across multiple blockchains!
So, I could be on SideChain-A and you could be on SideChain-B, and we could still exchange value between each other using LN as an intermediary.  That's how I think we will reach a much larger population, not by increasing the main bitcoin network blocksize; but rather by spinning up hundreds, if not thousands, of sidechains (in the same way that multi-player games just spin up more and more servers as demand grows).

Ok, two things here.  First, so long as the price of bitcoin doubles roughly every 4 years, the existing subsidy continues to compensate miners at the current level.  Second, if bitcoin evolves to being used primarily as a settlement layer for very high value transactions, then you can easily expect to see the average fee rise to closer to $10 or so; which is quite price competitive for moving tens of thousands to millions of dollars securely around the world.  
So, yes, an average transaction fee of $10 combined with a much higher market price for bitcoin should more than keep existing miners happy.

This is why, in the long term, people will *not* be opening and closing channels on the main bitcoin network.

The shards can be bound by things like the LN; because the LN can bind multiple blockchains together.

Then you don't understand how the LN works.
The LN requires on-chain transactions to open, close, and rebalance channels.  If we would like the LN to be decentralized (and we would) then ideally each user of the LN would have not one channel but more like four.
LN channels are limited in capacity.  If you open a channel with $10 worth of value, but you want to send $11 worth of value **YOU CANNOT**.  The channel simply does not have capacity.  So, you either need to send that $11 as a regular on-chain transaction, or, you need to close the old channel and open a new one with more capacity.  You must be able to estimate, ahead of time, how much channel capacity you will ever need.
But..that's not the end of it.  Because channels become unbalanced we need to frequently use regular on-chain transactions or close old channels and open new ones to rebalance them.
The LN does not eliminate the need for on-chain transactions, it can only reduce them for small payments like the mythical cup of coffee.
Since all LN channels are to be handled directly on the main bitcoin blockchain, then the main bitcoin blockchain becomes a gating limit on how many individual people who can actually use it.
In fact, virtually no transactions on the bitcoin network today are for low amounts of value or, 'cups of coffee' if you will.  The fees are too high. The network is too congested.
So, if we launched the LN it would not help in scaling at all!  Because, first, it would cause a bunch of *new* transactions just to create the channels in the first place, and then the transactions which would be occurring on the LN are transactions which aren't even practical on the network today anyway!!

Every time you create a 'shard' of the bitcoin network, in the form of a sidechain which pegs value to the main chain, that network can have a wildly different ecosystem than the main-chain.
It can use different blocksizes, blocktimes, and security model.  
Might there be some degree of centralization on some of these sidcechains?  Sure, but centralization on a sidechain which has perfect anonymity, no custodial risk, and only works with relatively low amounts of value, would probably be fine.
So long as the main bitcoin network is perfectly secure, sidechains dedicated to specific low value use cases would not need the same degree of security or decentralization necessarily.

Yes.  There is really little difference between a full-node and a mining-node.  Both have a complete history of the entire bitcoin blockchain and can validate every single transaction in exhaustive detail.
A full-node just doesn't produce blocks, but it does everything else.
In the original version of bitcoin the standard client could do both mining and validation.  Many forks of the bitcoin software still allow this.
It was only disabled in the bitcoin default client because mining on a CPU these days is meaningless.
The chance of finding a bitcoin block doing solo CPU mining is probably on the order of winning the Powerball lottery three or four times in a row.

There are numerous issues with that 'napkin math' but I want to address on in particular, which relates to traffic theory.
Let's say that you want to fill 100% of the bandwidth of a network for exactly one transaction per year.
Question, what is the *average wait time* for a new user to get a channel open request processed?
The average backlog will likely be measured in **MONTHS**.
And, I think we can agree that having to wait months to get access to the network is essentially unusable.
A network which has reached 100% capacity cannot respond to demand in a timely fashion.

I do not see that it changes mining incentives.  The miners are primarily compensated in the form of block subsidy.  As the utility of bitcoin grows, through the expansion of additional layers, then the market value of bitcoin will increase dramatically.  Additionally, as more and more 'low value' payments move off to secondary layers, that means the remaining transactions on the main bitcoin network will be for much, much, higher value (think thousands to millions of dollars).  Those transactions can easily afford to pay a much higher fee which will, in turn, increase the fees miners are compensated with.
Moving low-value, low-fee transactions to secondary layers, increasing the overall value and utility of the bitcoin token, will do nothing but make more money for miners.

Bitcoin does support smart contracts. The contract is held in a confirmed transaction on the blockchain.
Look, if you say you 'own some bitcoin' what does that mean? It means there are transaction outputs on the blockchain that you, and only you, have the private key to sign for.
Same thing with a LN smart contract. You exchange signatures with the other party giving you authority to spend unspent transaction outputs. You can close the contract at any time but, while it is open, simply holding the signatures gives you control over the funds.
Also, the LN is only useful for low value payments (think less than a $100 worth of value). For larger value this would occur on chain, be it on the bitcoin layer-1 network or a layer-2 side chain.

I use paper wallets and here is how I did it in steps.
* Step # 1: Move your bitcoin from that paper wallet to new paper wallets.  While this step is not technically necessary, it will greatly reduce confusion and provide you the most security.  Don't worry about your bitcoin cash tokens.  Those are still going to exist on their blockchain.  Sweeping the bitcoin to a new paper wallet is a way of 'separating' the coins.  Once this step is complete your bitcoin will be on the *new* paper wallets and your bitcoin-cash will still be accessible on the old ones.
* Step  : Once your bitcoin are safely on a new paper wallet, you can now install a bitcoin-cash wallet and sweep the funds from the old-paper wallets to it.  I use 'Coinomi', and in that app it's a very straightforward process.
* Step  : Once your bitcoin-cash tokens are on your Coinomi wallet, you can either send them to an exchange to trade, or just use changely or shapeshift to convert them to bitcoin.
You can use this bitcoin-cash blockchain explorer to check your BCH balances.

There is already a modest increase in blocksize pending approval called segwit, which not only nearly doubles the transaction capacity but fixes transaction malleability and adds important scripting improvements which will allow bitcoin to grow and scale. 
It is also implemented as a safe soft-fork, rather than the more violent approach of hard-forking the network and the entire ecosystem at once; which your 'simple' 2mb blocksize bump would require.

No.  One of the minor miracles of the lightning-network is that it works across multiple blockchains simultaneously.
You can, literally, send litcoin over the lightning network and someone else could receive bitcoin instantaneously.
This is because the LN merely exchanges signatures to already present smart contracts.  The contracts don't even have to be on the same blockchain.
In this fashion, you can use the lightning network to send bitcoin tokens between additional network layers.
I get that you, and others, may not yet 'understand this'.  It's complicated.  I'm never going to claim it's not complicated.  So is quantum mechanics, cryptography, and other forms of advanced mathematics.  Just because something is complicated and difficult to understand doesn't mean it doesn't work.  
Sadly, the 'big blocker crowd', is largely being driven through technical illiteracy.  Yes, the bitcoin network which expands to many additional layers *will be* much more complex than the single layer-1 network we have today.  The fact that something is complex is not a negative.  Things which do really cool shit are often quite complicated.
There is enormous complexity underpinning all kinds of technologies each of us use in our daily lives.  The average person has no clue how their cell-phone operates.  Including myself, I'm a software person not a hardware person, so how the actual hardware operates is way over my head.  That doesn't prevent me from using my cell phone.
This is why the 'bitcoin cash' hard fork is so great.  The technically illiterate crowd can go create their massive giant centralized network and watch it crumble around them.
Meanwhile, let bitcoin move forward on the current roadmap which has been designed by some truly brilliant engineers who have a clear vision for how the network will scale for the next decade.

My argument has factual support though.  I attended the 'Distributed Trade' conference this summer where all of the attendees were looking at non-monetary use cases for blockchain technology (stock trades, inventory management, purchase-order tracking, and medical records).  
If the bitcoin network could support a billion transactions a day with an average cost of a few cents apiece, I assure you that non-monetary use cases would consume all of it, rapidly.

The LN works by tying up funds into something called a 'channel'.  This is a smart contract on the bitcoin network.  The users exchange signed transactions between each other but don't actually commit them to the main bitcoin network.  This is how the 'scaling' works; because it defers committing the transactions and instead simply lets the two parties exchange signatures.
So, here's the problem.  
You can only send or receive as much money over the lightning network as is available on your open channel.
Meaning, if you open a channel for $1, then the most you can send or receive is just $1.  You cannot send any more.
And, it's worse than that.  If you open a channel with $1 but the other party doesn't commit any initial funds, then you can only send up to $1 but you cannot receive any money; at least until you have sent some.
It's like pouring water back and forth between two glasses.  Once any of the two glasses is full, you can't pour any more.
So, how does this work for microtransactions?  Not that bad.  You commit a small amount of money to a LN channel, say $10, and you can do as many itsy-bitsy-teenie-tiny transactions you want, so long as you don't exceed $10 in capacity on either side.
This can work, for sure, and it is the LN 'killer app' as far as I'm concerned.
However, if you want to be able to send and receive say thousands of dollars worth of value, then you and another party much commit *THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS* worth of value to a channel.  
That is simply impractical.
Further, as channels become unbalanced, it can quickly become impossible to find routes to send large amounts of value, because it requires a giant web of open channels each with a large enough capacity.
I do not see how the LN can function for anything other than the true micro-transaction use case (transactions for very minuscule amounts of value).
Larger value transactions will still need on-chain access.
Since there is not enough capacity on the main bitcoin network to support that, then either the blocksize limit would have to be dramatically raised (unlikely to happen), or those large value transactions will need to be pushed off to another network, perhaps a sidechain.
One of the features of the LN is that it can inter-operate *between multiple blockchains* at the same time.

The mere fact that the value of GBTC is uncorrelated to the price of bitcoin is a big problem. The low liquidity is the biggest issue. You cannot make a 'market' order. It's only an OTC asset.
You cannot convert GBTC back to bitcoin and there is no provable way that the bitcoin it is allegedly backed by exists.
I just feel like it is a really shitty asset to trade which I only touched because it was the only way to kind-of get exposure to bitcoin in a brokerage account.

Why would that be an issue with a network dedicated to low-value transactions?
@_date: 2016-11-29 19:00:30
Yeah, so people don't work like that.
Let's say that you want to open a channel one time, and keep it open forever.
That channel would have to be larger than the maximum amount of funds you would ever use for the entire period of time.
That could easily be thousands of dollars over time.  People don't have thousands of dollars just sitting around to tie up in a channel.
Channels become full and unbalanced.  People may want to receive more money than their channel capacity can hold (requiring an on-chain transaction).
This idea you have does, in fact, work if you open a channel for say $100 worth of value, and you only use it for cups of coffee and small transactions.
It doesn't work if the goal is to do all of your economic activity over it.  
I do not see any practical use case for LN channels for anything larger than 'pocket change'; money for low value transactions.
This does nothing to solve the 'store of value' use case.  It's the 'tie up all of my value' use case.  Whatever money you have tied up in a LN channel is now completely exposed to volatility risk.  
I do not see any scenario where the average person can do all of their economic activity over payment channels, only the low-value use case.
Realize that a LN channel is typically going to operate as a hot-wallet on the person's computer.  Are you going to stick your entire bitcoin stash to a LN channel?  Absolutely not.  Maybe $10, maybe a $100, but that's about it.
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:17:05


You would still need the LN, because the LN enables things no actual blockchain can do.  The LN enables massively scaled micro-transactions.  Nobody wants to commit trillions of low-value microtransactions to a dedicated permanent blockchain, that's a waste.

Yes, LN requires on-chain transactions.  However....who said those on-chain transactions have to happen on the bitcoin network??
You can open and close payment channels on a sidechain (shard) of the bitcoin network.  As population grows, you can add more and more shards.  The cool thing is that the LN is capable of hyper-linking multiple blockchains together into a seamless payment network (so long as they all share the same base token of value).

I say that because, in the case of a real ETF which actually tracks the price of bitcoin, who would hold any of this GBTC crap? It's not an ETF. It's a derivative of another product that is supposed to represent a certain amount of bitcoin.
Would you hold it if an actual ETF with high liquidity existed? I wouldn't hold one share of GBTC if a vastly superior product were available.
It's already extremely difficult to sell GBTC due to the very low liquidity.

I'm literally saying that to scale bitcoin we need to expand the network to include additional layers!
If you create a sidechain which pegs value to the bitcoin network, and inter-operates seamlessly, or you create a bi-directional payment channel, those are not something separate from bitcoin, they *ARE* bitcoin.  They expand the bitcoin ecosystem to include more and more features.
Why the heck people think cramming every single transaction and every single use case and every single person on the planet into a **SINGLE** network layer is 'the right thing to do' blows my mind.
That is not how scaling is done in any other part of computer science.
You don't scale 1,000x by building a 1,000x faster computer.  You scale to 1,000x by using 1,000 computers.
I can envision a future where the bitcoin network is comprised of hundreds, if not thousands, of sidechains seamlessly inter-operating together.

Here is what I do:
Generate a private key for a trezor.  
Do not write the private key down in plain text anywhere.  
Encrypt the private key using an encryption key, and only that do you store.
Finally, have an additional seed word which is not written down anywhere.
The key to decrypt the additional seedword is based on a kind of cipher (example: First letter of every paragraph from a particular chapter of a book).
You communicate this cipher method \*verbally\* to your heirs.  Actually walk them through the entire process, but use a different book/key, to make sure they remember and know how to derive the key.
In a safe deposit box, only accessible to your heirs upon your death based on a trust you have set up, store the key to the cipher (in this example, the name of the book and chapter).  
In the extreme case that your safe deposit box became compromised, this would not be enough information for anyone other than your direct heirs to decode the full private key.

People need to perform transactions to hold any value on the blockchain.

I like how he immediately jumps to the "everyone's cup of coffee" argument. The current blocksize limit allows only about three million people to transact ANY value on the network. All of these sidechain proposals assume that individuals can still peg some value to the main blockchain. What this means is that, even if a sidechain could support billions of micro-transactions per month, still only about three million people could hold value on the main blockchain to be pegged.
In other words, bitcoin doesn't need to scale to support more cups of coffee, it needs to scale to support more people!

Fair question.
BTC is better because it has the best development team.  It has the most security and the strongest most mature market.
But, you are correct, the market is fickle and if the market price of bitcoin crashed, it would be in trouble for sure.
It has proven the test of time better than all of the other cryptos in my personal opinion.  It's where I store my wealth and feel safest to do so; as safe as you can be holding crypto.

The problem is this.  If you do 100% of your trading activity on GDAX/Coinbase and let them have full custodial control at all times then, yeah, they could generate a reasonable looking 1099.
However..if like most you keep your BTC off of the exchange 99% of the time, then CB has no clue what your 'cost basis' is.  And any form they generate would be next to useless, if not misleading.
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:03:18
So...if the S2X chain has a ton of hashpower, and BTC is starved, you know what that means right?
It means people will be able to split and move S2X coins to exchanges quickly, but **not** BTC.
This means there will be massively more S2X on exchanges to sell, but way less BTC to buy.
Think about what that means for a moment...
Get it?
If S2X has majority hashpower it means it is a highly liquid asset to be sold in quantity, but BTC liquidity will dry up, making it worth even more.
I can find no one willing to trade their BTC for S2X. But nearly every BTC owner wants to dump at least some of their S2X coins ASAP because they think it's likely the only chance they will get an airdrop.
Look, I'll trade you 50 S2X tokens right now for 50 of your BTC. You gonna do it?

Dude, anyone can fork bitcoin with a click of a mouse button in two seconds. And, in minutes, they can change the rules. But, you see, the thing is no one will run that client.

No one can be a dictator of bitcoin, anymore than someone can be the bitcoin CEO.
Anyone can propose a new client. If fact, that is all they can do is make a proposal. They can argue and defend their proposal but no once can force miners and node operators to run their software.
Right now some are acting like bitcoin-core holds that exalted dictator status and they are rapidly learning the hard lesson that they don't control shit.
The only people who control bitcoin are 51%+ miners who use the same client.

So, guys, I'm a moderator in this forum, though I don't know for how long. It is late on a Saturday and I just logged in to see this mess. One of the forum moderators has been deleting hundreds of, what appear to me, to be perfectly valid comments.
Bitcoin-XT is NOT an alt-coin. It is an alternate client. Bitcoin-core is not some magical specially anointed copy of the code.  That is deeply flawed and centralized thinking.
Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized and whichever client the majority of the community runs will, naturally, organically, and by design, become the new rule set on the network.
I get that some people are strongly opposed to this fork. But, censoring discussion and incorrectly calling it an alt-coin is not the solution in my opinion.
For the record I haven't been removing any of these comments today and, after sharing my opinion in this post, I may be removed as one of the mods.  Which is fine if that happens. This is a volunteer thing that I do only when I'm already on the forum and have some free time.

The problem is that Grayscale is dumping an enormous amount of BCH over the next several weeks; about 170,000.  That's gonna be a lot of sell pressure.
Also, when they try to steal hashpower, what happens is that it actually makes it easier to sell BCH and harder to sell BTC.  Hashpower attacks have an interesting reverse market affect.

I'm not sure how it was secret. I saw a linked post where thymos stated his views publicly.
It also isn't a new policy. This subreddit has long removed posts about alt-coins.
The real question then, is bitcoin-xt an alt-coin or not? Since it is designed to run on the bitcoin network, I wouldn't technically consider it an alt-coin myself. On the other hand, it is a form of attack on the bitcoin network because it runs a non-standard hard fork.
If it were up to me I would allow the discussion, but thymos has a different opinion.
I am not in favor of bitcoin-xt personally. My preference would be a compromise change on bitcoin-core. I would be satisfied if all we did was raise the blocksize limit to just 2mb now, as that would at least double capacity.
I'm not really happy about how any of this is going. I never thought the biggest threat to bitcoin would be the inability of its greatest  supporters to agree on even minor changes.

I would.  But, you see, people commit bugs all of the time.  To branches.  Then they get reviewed.  And then they get tested.  If they end up going out live, that is potentially disastrous and I would expect some mea culpa's if that happened. 
Changing this software is so dangerous that any changes must be made with the absolute, utmost, extreme caution.
There's something about complex software that not everyone understands.
You can make the most simple innocuous looking change to a piece of source code.   You can look at it, and it seems fine.  Your peers can look at it, and it seems fine.  You can test it, and it can pass all tests.
Then, when you put it out into the real world, there is a 'butterfly effect' where even the simplest code change can expose another bug that was hidden and dormant for years, and shit can go south.
I've had it happen.
In fact, I had a massively multiplayer online game that was played by hundreds of thousands of people have a bug like that.
It shut down the entire team, full time, for over two weeks to find it.  The bug was almost impossible to reproduce.
This shit is complicated, and people who act like it's 'nothing to make a simple change' are naive and inexperienced.

His behavior is really transparent.  I've met him in person.  He's like crazy super intense, passionate, and hyper-emotional.  Guys like that are super easy to read.
He 100% honestly believes that:
* Blockstream is evil
* Blockstream is destroying bitcoin and going against the true original vision of Satoshi and the project
* Craig Wright really is Satoshi and is going to bring back his original vision of massive transaction capacity to service every person in the world.
* He is the champion of bitcoin saving it from this evil corporate blockstream takeover.
In other words, he believes exactly all of the bat shit crazy stuff he says.  In his mind he is the *good guy* and anyone following the core developers and roadmap have been brainwashed by censorship.
He really, truly, believes all of these things.  He thinks he is the good guy here.

You are aware that dogecoin and ethereum run on a different network right? If you submit a dogecoin transaction the bitcoin network never sees it or attempts to process it. This is what makes it an alt-coin, the fact that it runs on a different network.
Bitcoin-xt is a fork of the bitcoin-core client. It runs on the same network. It processes bitcoin transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. It is backwards compatible and only changes the ruleset to allow larger blocks if it reaches a supermajority of the BITCOIN network.
This means that it is not an alt-coin, it is an alt-client.
Understand now?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:07:33
Even if they must, BCH is so centralized I don't see why they would have any difficulty getting all the exchanges to update on short notice. Other alt-coins do it all the time.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:16:34
You are not foolish. What you are is an alt-coin trader. You were gifted an alt-coin for free. You can hold it or sell it. This is entirely a personal decision.
For me I look at it this way. There are hundreds of alt-coins so the question is, would I have bought this alt-coin had it not just been gifted to me?
If the answer is no, then go ahead and sell it. If you 'believe in the future' of the alt-coin, go ahead and hold it.
I sold my BCH at 0.1btc. I think it reached as high as 0.15btc at it's highest, so I could have timed the market better.
BCH is going to get **crushed** in the coming months due to massive dumps from GBTC and others.
If you don't believe in the long term prospects of BCH or want to time the market better, you might want to sell now.

The bottom line is that as frustrating as this S2X experience is, it's going to end up being probably the single greatest shining moment in the history of bitcoin.
A 51% attack without replay protection has always been an existential threat.
With the correct tools, enough nodes, support in the market, we can fight this back and win resoundingly.
Having beaten back a 51% hostile hard-fork attack once, few will bother to try it again; as it's just a great way to lose a lot of money.
Miners work for us.  Their job is simple.  Mine blocks at a profit.  They don't control the protocol. They never did.  Neither do corporations.
Now it's time they learn.
It's also important to realize that they are pushing a complete straw man bullshit narrative that 'core doesn't want bitcoin to scale'.  That's the biggest lie of all.
Core wants bitcoin to scale.  Much more than some modest 2x bump would offer.  We will scale exponentially to levels difficult for people to even imagine right now.
And, the technologies that we are going to use to scale **will destroy a number of businesses currently in the NYA**!
Once we have fully decentralized exchanges with cross-chain atomic swaps; at that point most crypto-exchanges will go out of business.  
There is still a role for businesses to play, helping people to on-ramp and off-ramp fiat, there always will be, but eventually, where we are heading, people aren't going to want shitty fiat at all.

Transaction malleability has a unique signature in the blockchain when it has been successfully processed. Myself, and others, analyzed the blockchain for instances where this occurred.

Here are two ways.
* Move some of your bitcoin onto an exchange **right now**.  I have already done that.  Not much, but not zero either.  The exchange will give you B2X tokens to sell immediately.
* For your cold storage bitcoin.  Log into your exchange and withdraw a small amount of B2X coin to your cold-storage address.  This will 'taint' your coins.  You can then sweep the entire cold-storage wallet and that transaction will be B2X only.

*EDIT* I have not been in communication with theymos in the past day. I meant I had been in communication (via modmail) regarding his position on bitcoin-xt. He informed all of the mods that bitcoin-xt should be treated as an alt-coin. This was a few weeks ago.
Yes. I'm in communication. Theymos's position is that bitcoin-xt is an alt-coin, indistinguishable from dogecoin or litecoin. He is wrong, but he claims that is the reason for this. Dogecoin and litecoin operate on independent networks. No one submits a transaction to dogecoin and it shows up in the backlog for the bitcoin network.
Bitcoin-xt is an alternate client on the bitcoin network. This notion that there is only one pure authorized, authentic version of the bitcoin software is nonsense. That is centralized thinking. The correct bitcoin software is the ruleset being run by a majority of the network. Today that is bitcoin-core, but there is no reason to assume it can be the only valid software.

Presumably people will buy the BCH because they 'believe in bitcoin cash' (I find it hard to believe many people will fork over millions of USD to do that) or, far more likely, they will buy it well under market price with the intention of dumping it for a fast profit.
Depending on what the auction winners do with the BCH will determine how it affects markets; but it is only an indirect effect.
If Grayscale just dumped massive sell orders on the open market they would crash the price.  Which they are not doing because they have an obligation to get the maximum amount of value they can.

Everyone's agenda in bitcoin is protect their investment.  That's how bitcoin works you idiot.
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:50:51
My thoughts. Lately bitcoin seems like the 'Occupy' movement. Paralyzed by the notion that not only can no single person be a leader but that no real consensus can ever be met.
I'm terribly disappointed by the block-size debate. For a while I thought it was healthy but, over time, it now seems to be a sign of deep dysfunction.
I have made a significant personal investment in bitcoin, based on a combination of belief in the technology and ideology, but nothing concerns me more than this current crisis. Not governments, not the bit license, but rather the fact that we appear paralyzed and unable to improve or make changes to bitcoin.
If this impasse is not resolved soon then we will all be moving to some alt-coin because bitcoin is going to be dead. A worldwide payment network and currency exchange is hopeless if it can only support a couple of million people on a planet comprised of billions.
I hoped, and expected, some kind of compromise. So, 20mb is too big? Ok, how about 2mb? That at least doubles capacity.
I have been so optimistic seeing real organic growth in the bitcoin ecosystem. Seeing people in countries with horrible currencies and other people blocked from access to conventional payment networks learn how to use bitcoin to solve their real life problems.
What are we? The new Occupy movement sitting around in a drum-circle incapable of getting anything accomplished only to become completely irrelevant through our incompetence and inability to affect change and make decisions?!?

What the community wants is a happy and harmonious development group able to reach compromise to deliver features that people are asking for.
We want bitcoin to scale to allow more users.  When bitcoin-core reaches a reasonable compromise proposal, I think this will all die down. Until then, if the majority of users want the FEATURES offered by bitcoin-xt (who developed those features is less important) then that is the direction it will go.
I don't want bitcoin-xt personally. I also don't want bitcoin core held hostage by developers who refuse to address at even the most basic level scalability issues.
Maybe when the bitcoin core devs realize that they do not personally "own" or control bitcoin, they will wake up and start acting responsibly. Until then, people who want bitcoin to scale (and I'm one of them) have no choice but to run bitcoin-xt.
This reminds me of the bitcoin foundation. When they acted like they owned and controlled bitcoin. What did the bitcoin community tell this centralized organization to do?  Oh yeah, we told them to fuck off and they are now bankrupt and gone.
If bitcoin core devs don't wake up soon, they could suffer the same fate.

I hear you...but....what about this?
Let's say that decentralized off-blockchain solutions save the day and fix all daily transaction problems. Great. But, for bitcoin to still even be relevant, or even part of the discussion, users of these off-chain solutions must be able to peg against value stored on the main blockchain.
Currently only about three million people in any given month could peg any value against the main blockchain.
So, what I'm asking, is even if we only use the bitcoin network as a high fee, scarce resource, settlement network, what good is it if only a few million people can even access it? How does that help the unbanked?  How does it help any larger segment of society than us early tech-nerds who got excited about it?

There are a few people who managed to sell BCH for more than 0.1BTC.
You are confusing price.  If you sold BCH at $300 when the price of BTC was $3,000; you are way ahead of the game than if you currently hold BCH worth say $600.  Because the price of BTC has done even better.
And, who really wants to hold BCH long term anyway?  Some do, but most BTC people do not.  If you are going to hold any alt-coin, there are better alternatives out there.

I heard he had 300,000 bitcoin 'at one time'. I don't know if that is true of not.  Considering how much he promotes alt-coins and does stupid shit like buy BCH, I figure he has could have lost a bunch of them over time.
On the other hand, he's probably gotten in early on nearly every alt-coin, like ETH, so he's probably expanded his fortune more than he's lost.
It's probably safe to say he's worth hundreds of millions at least.
Frankly, anything over $10 million is more than any person 'really needs' as far as I'm concerned.  
Even on a conservative 3% draw; $10 million generates a $300,000 year income and I'm gonna say if you can't live a decent lifestyle on 300k a year, GTFO.

A hard fork is when there is a change to the bitcoin software which modifies the rules. Anyone who doesn't upgrade to the new version of the software is on the "old fork" and people who upgrade to the new version of the software only accept the blocks with the new rules.
This effectively creates two copies of the bitcoin blockchain. It represents a massive threat to the bitcoin network as it creates a loss of confidence and a fragmentation of the core database.
Today most rule changes include a consensus threshold, where the new rules will only be applied if a super majority accepts them.
Since no single person 'owns' bitcoin, reaching consensus on rule changes is an ugly process and, frighteningly enough, might become impossible.

So, I assume the goal of this algorithm is to always make it profitable to mine BCH right?  And, if that is the goal, the only way they can do that is by bribing miners with an accelerated block reward; as they have been doing.
If they can only get miners to mine their shit coin by bribing them with accelerated coinbase rewards, that is the true definition of a death spiral; because they will only accelerate the halving and they will have no fee revenue to replace it.

I'm in Silicon Valley on a business trip and, especially with the recent rise in the price of bitcoin, I really wanted to find a place for an IRL transaction.
I used my airbitz app and found that merely a block away from my hotel was a smoke shop that accepts bitcoin.
I stopped by tonight and the cashier had never used the bitcoin point of sale system before. I walked him through it so he could make their first bitcoin purchase.
Then I set him up with the Mycelium wallet and gave him $10 worth of bitcoin as a gift. After that he had a bunch of questions, like how to buy more, so I walked him through the whole Mycelium local trader option and I sold him$10 more.
It really felt great considering these important and critical times in the history of bitcoin.

If you try to sell it all at once it will crash the price. Sell it all at once off exchange and you might get close to market rate (if you can find a buyer). Otherwise you just have to sell it slowly over a long period of time.

So, in context, you think claiming the bitcoin network was never designed as a payment network is a sincere and genuine non-trollish comment?  Really?  I don't know what sub-reddit you have been living on for the past three years, but it has always been promoted as a low cost payment network that could easily scale as demand increased.  Only recently, *very recently*, has the script been flipped.

@_date: 2015-07-07 04:53:44
The 'proper fee' in my opinion strikes a balance between bitcoin still being useful as a payment network while not causing a backlog of transactions.  There is an upper limit to how high the fee can get before bitcoin stops working as a day-to-day transaction network.  It could probably be more than two cents, but not much more than a dime, is my guess, before it stops working.
Currently, we could alleviate a lot of pressure just by make a very modest increase in the block-size; not 20mb, just something 2 or 4x.
Once realistic off-chain solutions exist, and wallet software supports them, then we can, at that time, start increasing the fees more.
Of course, these off-chain solutions do not yet exist, nor are they integrated into existing wallet software.  Until then, a massive backlog of fee bearing transactions is a failure of the network, in my personal opinion.

It was a simple question which could even have a yes or no answer.  You seem to be suggesting that a mod cannot also post to I'm pretty sure that isn't the case and, if it is, then I don't want to be a mod anymore.  Being a mod is a relatively thankless job which primarily involves removing spam, scam, and duplicate posts throughout the day.  
Obviously I am well aware that bitcoin would not, and could not, ever have a steady 1% increase in value.  It is simply not designed to work that way.  That wasn't what the question was about.  The question was a hypothetical to explore the motivations of individual bitcoiners.  The general narrative to many is that bitcoin is a get rich quick ponzi scheme being hyped by early adopters.  This is proven out every single time there is a price rise and this forum gets flooded with more 'immature, childish, drama-queen, uninformed, and hysterical' posts about 'going to the moon'.
I find it really interesting that you interpret my posts this way.  I'm a huge bitcoin supporter.  For a wide range of reasons.  And I am personally invested in bitcoin.  But, bitcoin is not perfect.  It has a lot of problems, many of which seriously need to be fixed. 
The reason I made the post in the first place is that it is a question I often ask myself.  I have a decent number of bitcoins and I often wonder if I would be satisfied if they merely held their value (rather than having some chance of being worth a ridiculous sum in the future) and, for me, the answer is always yes.  I was curious what other people thought on the same topic.

With the number of new people signing up to Coinbase combined with all of the press coverage surrounding CME, I think that is driving the price rise.
Let me give you an example.  I have a friend who has millions and millions of dollars worth of BTC that he bought for less than 30 cents apiece.
This guy can influence the market when he dumps S2X coin.
For anyone to buy today, they would have to spend millions of dollars buying up BTC, what, only to dump it?

I have been very critical of the Lightning Network for a long time because it requires so many on-chain transactions.
This paper **may** indicate a radical solution to the problem.
I haven't dug into this yet in great detail but, at the top level, it seems sort of like a lightning network for the lightning network.
It's a layer that goes between the bitcoin blockchain and the lightning network that end-users interact with.
This additional layer allows you to rapidly open, close, and rebalance channels *without causing on-chain pressure*!
This intermediate layer, too, uses payment channels as well, and acts as a middleman/proxy for end users.
Like I said, I haven't dug into the details yet.  I don't even know if it works or not.
However..what I'm super excited is that someone is:
* Acknowledging the problems I have been concerned about for a very long time.
* Proposing a solution that does not involve sidechains.
Now, it may not actually work, but if it does, this could be the infamous 'missing link' to make everything all work together.

It's worth noting that the spread between the GTBC price and the open market price for bitcoin is at its narrowest range yet.  
Previously GBTC had been trading at the equivalent of $280-$300 per BTC all while the price of BTC was around $240.
Today the price of BTC is near $290 and the price of GBTC is around $307; still a markup but nowhere near where it was in the past.

Here is a revised chart showing the correct relative GBTC price.  As correctly pointed out, the price of shares of GBTC to bitcoin is not one share = 0.1 bitcoin, but rather one share equals 0.0965 bitcoins; and is steadily decreasing over time due to this funds very expensive and excessive charge of 2% a year for a passive fund.
Here is the revised graph:
The blue line corresponds to 1 share of GBTC equals 0.1 bitcoin; which is what my original graph had.  This is incorrect.  The red line of 1 share of GBTC equals 0.0965 bitcoins is the correct one and, as you can see, this makes the price premium even higher.  And, over time, the amount of bitcoin your shares represent diminish at a rate of 2% a year; so you gotta hope bitcoin is increasing in value by more than 2% a year to stay ahead of the game.
All that said, Webbush is still pumping it as a good buy so..shrug...

They act like there is nothing they can do about what people post on the network but that simply isn't true. They have gone to some effort to implement a reputation system, which is deemed necessary to prevent people from running scams.
It is just software. They could also implement a community based moderation system that would support curating the listings. This is not some big technical challenge. 
They are building both a physical network and a community. If you give the community the proper tools then they can help create a welcoming marketplace that does not promote illicit products.
But, if you design a system without any such tools, then it will rapidly degenerate into a cesspool no one will want to be associated with.

By 'proposes' I mean produces a bitcoin client which introduces features that would require a hard fork.
Is it your belief that the bitcoin software is frozen in stone? It can never change? That any change requiring a hard fork cannot be discussed here?
How can people reach consensus when they cannot even discuss, compare, and contrast different features?
I still don't understand why, in a decentralized network, any one software implementation and proposed change, has authority over another?
From what I am hearing it seems that the bitcoin network cannot, will not, and will never scale big enough to support more than a few million users.
I haven't been involved in bitcoin as long as you, but I think we both came to it with a similar motivation. If bitcoin can only ever serve a few million people. If it can only be used as a high fee settlement network for wall street and big banks, well, frankly that is not what I signed up for. I wanted something to free us from bankers, government fiat, and empower the unbanked. But a bitcoin network that can only service, at most, a few million people cannot do any of those things.
Any solution which helps solve scalability issues must require a fork from someone. Whether that fork comes from core or some other group.
But, we cannot even discuss scalability in bitcoin because all scalability solutions require a hard fork and all hard forks are unauthorized attacks on the existing network.

Bitcoin is fundamentally political and most of its supporters, including myself, are involved for political reasons. 
Here are just a few basic properties of bitcoin which make it fundamentally political.
* It challenges the notion that only the state can create money. Private money is fundamentally political.
* It has as a core property the ability for individuals to control their own money without need for a 3rd party or intervention from the state. It cannot be confiscated. It cannot be blocked. It cannot be controlled.
* It has as a core property the idea that individuals should be able to protect their personal privacy for financial transactions.
All three of these are fundamentally political and, worldwide, governments oppose these ideas.
Sorry, but bitcoin is a political technology at its core.

As you can see in the chart there was some rather irrational pricing when GBTC first launched; people were paying absurd sums of money, I don't know why, just because they finally could?  Hard to say.
The price has been at a consistent premium since then, but the GBTC market seems to respond slowly and with the rapid run-up in BTC price of the past few days it has caused GBTC to nearly reach parity.
The big question will be when BTC price is higher than GBTC and how the market will respond.  Will GBTC actually be lower than BTC come Monday morning?  It's likely.

You seem to be missing the point.  Ethereum may be the greatest invention in history.  That is fine.  I welcome people to discuss it on the sub-reddit for that alt-coin.  And, no matter how awesome you think it is, it also *is* just another alt-coin; with it's own network and is completely disconnected from the bitcoin network.
If someone wants to write a post about how bitcoin (not Ethereum) is integrating some new ethereum like features; that would be fine and relevant to bitcoin.  But, not the other way around.
@_date: 2015-07-07 04:44:41
That's a totally reasonable question.  I think it should be a balance of a 'reasonable' fee while still allowing bitcoin to be used as a payment network.  Back in the old days people would send bitcoin transactions worth one one hundred millionths of a penny for free.
A week or so ago, you could send a transaction for a few cents.  Low enough that even for a cup of coffee, you could ignore that.  
Can that be raised? Sure, but how much?  You reach a point where if it is to high bitcoin simply stops working as a payment network for anything other than very large purchases.  Which, sadly, dramatically reduces it's usefulness and appeal.
However, there are two variables we can adjust.  One is the fee, of course, but the other is the block-size.  Raising the blocksize has always been part of the plan for scaling bitcoin for years.  Now, suddenly, it is off the table?  I feel that those who are promoting a winner take all fee market, while not even considering adjusting the other side of the equation, clearly have an agenda.
It should be a balance of both.  A combination of increasing transaction volume *and* adjusting minimum fees to strike a balance.  At some point off-chain solutions will have to accommodate micro-transactions.  What I don't consider acceptable is the bitcoin network backing up and simply failing to process minimum-fee paying transactions as is happening today.

I'm getting so tired of hearing how 'hard' bitcoin is to use. I explain it to people all of the time. I set them up with a wallet on their cell phone in minutes.
Millions of people have PayPal accounts hooked up to their checking account. That process is identical when connecting a coinbase account. I have had numerous people create Coinbase accounts with no special help or assistance from me.
Sure, there are technical complications related to safely securing large amounts of bitcoin in offline cold storage but, for the typical non investor usage, it really isn't that difficult.
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:17:34
I did, but to me the key question is does the trust actually hold bitcoin to back each share of GBTC? I believe they do but it would be nice to get more 'proof' of reserves and that sort of thing.  I'm not particularly concerned about exchanging shares for actual bitcoins; that is not interesting to me.  I just want a fund which tracks the market price of bitcoin and, in the US, GBTC is the closest thing we have to it.
@_date: 2015-08-12 02:02:14
Here is what I don't understand. Doesn't this still require that an individual have funds on the core blockchain? I understand that individual transactions can be moved off to the side, but I thought it was still pegged to some balance in the main blockchain?
This would make bitcoin act as a settlement network, where most small scale transactions happen on blockstream.
So, here is the problem. The current bitcoin block limit cannot act as a settlement layer for a very large population. Meaning no matter how many transactions you move off to the side, still, only a very small number of people can hold any value on the blockchain itself.
At a one mb limit the bitcoin network can only support a few tens of millions of people holding any value at all.
Don't many of these business models based on using bitcoin as a settlement layer want more than ten million users!?

We have had negotiations as to what constitutes a 'small' or 'minimum' fee and they have been adjusted over time.  Maybe that is two cents worth, or four cents worth, but never was it supposed to a be cage fight, winner take all system.  We are not supposed to get massive backlogs of transactions in a working payment network.  This was never the 'plan'.
If anyone who has been around for the past three years thinks a $5 transaction fee on the bitcoin network, and a massive backlog of unconfirmed transactions, 'was the plan all along', I gotta say, that's a bit hard to believe.  The plan of record was to scale the bitcoin network as demand grew.  It was not to make an exclusive network only accessible by banks and wealthy people.
@_date: 2015-07-09 04:54:50
The real issue is when the "attack," represents user adoption. Bitcoin can currently support only a few million legitimate users at a time.
In other words, simple user adoption represents an "attack". Bitcoin needs to scale by at least one order of magnitude to continue to grow.

How is it 'consistent'? Bitcoin is not tied to any one specific client implementation. That would be a dangerous centralized point of control. I doubt Satoshi would ever support three core devs holding the bitcoin network hostage acting like they are the ones who own, rule, and control the only 'authorized' client. If we are arguing for that then I have major concerns for the bitcoin core devs.
They are now acting as the owners, rulers, and controllers of bitcoin. This makes them subject to all manner of legal risks including prosecution for financial crimes in the eyes of various world governments.
The only 'official' bitcoin client is the ruleset being run by the majority of the network.

I'm not sure whether or not one single thread based on a news article which discussed ethereum in terms of how it was relevant to bitcoin would be a problem. In fact, something like that might realistically be allowed.
But that is not at all what I encountered this morning.  It was a steady stream of ethereum spam all over the subreddit.
I also don't think the argument about how 'cool' or 'innovative' an alt-coin is should determine whether it is allowed here or not.  That is a slippery slope.  Most of the objections in this thread have been from people gushing about how awesome Ethereum is.  I'm not debating whether or not ethereum is awesome or not. At least if I want to have that debate I will do so at Whether an alt-coin is cool or not, doesn't change the fact that it is an alt-coin; which policy states are off-topic for this sub.
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:08:56
So, far cheaper than a 51% attack, a malicious actor can shut down the bitcoin network just by spamming the network with (relatively speaking) high fee transactions. After a few days, or weeks, it would destroy confidence in the network.

Yes, is being censored.  As one of the moderators I'm one of the guys doing the censoring.  Of course, by censoring, I mean moderation.
People in general don't know or see this, because moderation here is fairly decent, but on a daily basis this subreddit is flooded with spam, duplicate posts, scams, and off-topic posts.  We moderators are not perfect, we don't catch them all (your reports help a LOT!), but we catch a lot of them.  We also sometimes remove things by accident we probably shouldn't have.  People report these instances and they usually get corrected.
So, yes, this subreddit is being censored (i.e. moderated) and that is a good thing; because if it wasn't this would be a bigger zoo than it already is.
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:55:41

He is incompetent, not because he had a bug in his code, but because he didn't have it extensively reviewed and tested before being deployed to a live 100 billion dollar+ financial network.
The fact that CEOs managing billions and billions of dollars of assets allowed and encouraged this to occur is quite literally obscene.
We have been telling everyone for years now how absolutely careful you have to be about this stuff.
Lots of other industries which protect things of great value (transportation, medicine, and, yes, other financial networks) employ the most stringent process for development, review, and testing.
And, every time we tell the community this, what do we get back?
"Oh, it's just a one line code change.  What could possibly go wrong?"
Meanwhile, ETH is losing money left and right from people running buggy scripts on the fucking 'Turing complete' blockchain.  As if being Turing complete is supposed to be a **positive** and not what it really is, an irresponsible and unacceptable security risk.

I see. So a small group of developers are allowed to hold a centralized iron grip on what constitutes the "official" bitcoin reference client? You make reference to their authority as experts but bitcoin-xt is backed by devs with equal reputation.
A 'popularity' vote is the only way to move forward. All of bitcoin is a popularity vote. At any time a group of miners could collude to change their bitcoin clients and they would win if they have 51% hashing power combined.
Letting the community decide is the only, proper, decentralized solution. Appeals to authority and centralized control are not going to win many converts.

Increase the block-size, which was always the plan.  And, while I think a reasonable negotiation makes sense as to what constitutes a 'low-fee' (2 cents, 4 cents, etc) I don't consider $5 USD anywhere near acceptable.

I hope it will.  First, I hope the Lightning Network presentation materials will get revised. Second, my goal is stop people like 'luke-jr', (who is a core dev) from repeating these false claims as fact.  He does this all of the time, and uses that slide as a justification for why the blocksize should actually be decreased!
Probably the biggest thing I hope to accomplish is to show that opening and closing channels just once every six months, simply will not work.
If I had a sufficient background in mathematics, maybe I could prove it that way. 
But, instead, I'm just going to simulate it.  It is my 'intuition' that if a massive number of people were trying to access the bitcoin blockchain just twice per year, the *average* mempool backlog would probably be measured in weeks.  And, of course, if transactions are backlogged by weeks, the entire concept of the LN simply doesn't even work.
Obviously the *real* solution to these problems is a combination of both on-chain scaling combined with off-chain scaling.
However, how can we have a sensible conversation when core devs are claiming that none of this is even a problem!?
If, it turns out, that the realistic use case is for every person to have four channels open, and with them averaging opening and closing a channel say once every few weeks, then let's run those numbers.
If that is the realistic assumption, great, let's work with those numbers.  However, I have had extensive and exhausting conversations with core devs who swear that one channel every six months **IS** the realistic use-case.
At any rate, a simulation that actually attempts to shove as many people as possible onto the LN has real value.  Not a simulation of Bob, Larry, and Alice, but a simulation of, quite literally, tens of millions of people.
I think it will be useful.

I could have just kept removing the alt-coin posts without making any comment.  As a public service I decided to make a specific post reminding people what is already clearly stated in the side bar of this forum:
Here you go, exact quote from the sidebar for this subreddit:
"Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies."
All this says is that my post was probably unnecessary as the policy was clearly stated.  So, definitely I may have made a mistake by making this post to remind people that Ethereum is, yes indeed, just another alt-coin; no matter how excited people are about it.

You are preaching to the choir. I agree with all of this, but I'm still not convinced calling an optimization an 'attack' is entirely productive. 
They still produce valid blocks, even if they use a shortcut. I don't see how they aren't playing by the rules. I agree, it is not ideal. It was not intended that this shortcut be utilized. And I agree we should change it.
But there is no incentive for them to change the bitcoin software in a way that breaks their shortcut.

Here's 'the problem with that'.  Because he is so wealthy **he has nothing at risk**.  He can threaten **our** value by attacking the network with no risk to himself. 
That's the issue.  He can treat our network like a playtoy and put our money at risk with no personal risk to himself.
He has repeatedly pumped alt-coins over and over again.  He previously told everyone that 'Mt Gox is just fine', nothing to worry about.
So, the issue with him 'being a millionaire', is that he can fuck things up for everyone else, attack **our money** while accepting no personal risk at all.
No matter how much money he pisses away attacking the bitcoin network, even if he's not making a killing trading alts (which he probably is), he will still be obscenely wealthy in the end.
Meanwhile, those of us who really do have money at risk on the bitcoin network suffer.

It uses a hacked copy of the reference client source code which has been corrupted by an inexperienced development team.  This client is wildly out of date with the reference client.
The development team hacked the client such that core consensus rules are now dynamically controllable by miners alone, on the fly, changing the fundamental consensus mechanism of the network and exposing it to new vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
The client is not supported by the economic majority, those who actually have money at stake in bitcoin.  
The attack is being done by just a handful of individuals who want to change the network for their own economic advantage.
It fits the definition of a  hostile, adversarial, and controversial 51% attack in every possible way.

The Lighting Network *is* part of the bitcoin network.  What you do is lock up some funds into a multi-signature *confirmed* transaction.  You then execute hash-time-locked contracts to adjust the balance between two parties, without actually committing the transactions until a later date.  Meaning, you can exchange a signed contract with the person/company you opened the channel with every time a 'transaction' occurs; however you don't commit the transaction until you want to close the channel out.  The entire time you are always dealing with bitcoin transactions; they just haven't been committed yet.

You are correct for a single-direction payment channel, but that isn't very interesting.  A bi-directional payment channel requires *both* parties to lock-up funds in the funding transaction to allow money to move both directions.

The LN slide deck says that.
See the following image.  This is the nonsense I'm trying to debunk.  The myth that the LN can support 50 million people who open only **ONE** channel every **SIX MONTHS** with a 1mb block size limit.
Core devs are repeatedly referencing this slide deck as gospel for why the blocksize doesn't need to grow until we have 50,000,000 active users.  
One of the things my simulation is going to try to show first, is that if 50 million people attempted to use 100% of the transaction capacity of the bitcoin network to cycle two transactions every six months, that the entire network would simply stop working; since the average wait time to clear a transaction would probably be weeks.

Here's the best analogy I can think of.  Let's say a thousand people have money on deposit with the bank.  (Let's assume a fictional bank which doesn't practice fractional reserve).
Now, let's say those customers have an average daily balance of about $200.  However, at any given time, some people might have more money than that, and some less.  This is a constantly changing amount.
For the bank, this doesn't really matter.  So long as they have enough money on deposit for all of the customers, they are just moving around values in a database.  Also, this is exactly how the bitcoin blockchain works.  Transactions constantly redistribute funds from old outputs to new outputs each time.  Money gets freely and evenly redistributed within the system.
However...with payment channels, it doesn't work that way.  Let's say that even though, on average, every customer only has a $200 balance but, at any given time, any customer wants the *option* to have up to $2,000 in their account; this doesn't always happen, but maybe on payday or something.
With the lightning network, you cannot freely and easily redistribute the balance of all funds on an immediate need for each user!
Instead, $2000 must be on deposit for every single customer since that represents the maximum amount they will ever need; even though the *average* amount is $200.
With the original scenario, for 1,000 customers each with an average balance of $200, then only $200,000 of money is required to service them.  However, with the 'payment channels', instead 2 *million* dollars must be on deposit!
The amount of value 'locked up' is proportional to the *maximum* amount of value every user will ever want to transact at any given time!
For the micro-transaction use case, this isn't a big deal.  However, if you want to do high value transactions over a very long period of time, an obscene amount of value would have to be locked up to allow for money to flow through the system.
Who is going to provide the billions upon billions of dollars worth of bitcoin to keep these channels open? Only very large corporations with deep pockets can provide that kind of liquidity, and those corporations will be subject to heavy regulation.

@_date: 2017-04-26 02:49:39
You need an on-chain transaction to open a channel and another one to close it. However, if you wish to be a full participant in the network and help keep if fully decentralized you would probably want to maintain four open channels.
However, the real issue is that channels can only support a maximum amount of value transfer relative to the funding transaction. If your channel is unabalanced or your transaction in any other way exceeds channel capacity you either need to do an on-chain transaction or close and reopen a new channel.
For these reasons the number of on-chain transactions will be much higher than this notion of just one every​ six months or so. It is also the reason why LN is probably only useful for relatively low amounts of value.
LN can only offload high frequency low value payments which, frankly, are already priced out of the network today.
So, yes, it can handle the mythical "cup of coffee" but everything else will still be on-chain.
@_date: 2016-02-12 23:04:23
It wasn't easy.  It took a long time to wrap my head around it all, but with that example you can actually make a pretend lightning network in the real world.

@_date: 2016-02-26 22:07:27
Apparently this article has gone somewhat viral and, in turn, it has become quite controversial.  I would like to add this note.  I am a huge fan of the Lightning Network.  I think it offers a fantastic opportunity to off-load the vast majority of LOW-VALUE payments from the bitcoin network; and that is a really good thing.  However, I see numerous problems with the notion that it can off-load virtually all payments, including high-value payments, and that users will keep high-value payment channels open, exclusively, for six months at a time.  Maybe I'm wrong, and time will tell.  However, I think all of the concerns raised in this article are legitimate, and we will see how it plays out over time.  
To those who are proposing the Lighting Network as a solution for the mythical 'cup of coffee' problem, I'm right there with you. I believe it could be a godsend for not only that use-case but many other small-value transaction use-cases which were impossible before.
However, to those who claim people will only ever need to perform two transactions every six months, that 100% of all payment transactions can be off-ramped to the Lightning Network, that 100% of the entire bitcoin transaction processing capacity will be consumed by simply opening and closing channels, and that tens of billions of dollars of value will be locked up into payment channels with no loss of decentralization and unaffected by regulation, I still think these claims are absurd.  I also think that the claimed multiplier factor for how many users can take advantage of the LN without a corresponding block-size increase, remain off by more than an order of magnitude.
This article is not an anti-lighting network article.  How could it be? I think the Lightning Network is awesome.  This is a reality check article.  One that questions how long is it going to take, and just how much can it really accomplish, and the risks involved along the way.  These are all legitimate questions to ask!

If that is the case then LN cannot be decentralized!

By 'exists' I mean as a functioning system that is usable by the community and capable of off-loading payment transactions from the bitcoin network.
It will take a very long time before it is in a state capable of doing this, if it ever happens as that is a long road ahead.
We are making important decisions today based on promises of a technology which does not yet exist.
I readily admit that the LN could easily solve the mythical 'cup of coffee' problem.  What is less certain is if it can solve the 'every single kind of payment problem' such that people virtually never perform a single on-chain transaction.


You are wrong.  The LN requires every single user to have an on-chain funding transaction to open a channel, and another one to close a channel.  LN proponents claim that people will only ever need to do those two transactions once every six months and 100% of their economic activity otherwise can happen on the LN.  I think this claim is, quite frankly, extremely dubious.  There are numerous issues with this assumption, as pointed out in my article already.
You continue this false narrative by throwing out numbers like '100-180' million users, with the existing 1mb block size limit, which is just simply a lie.  The actual number is probably about 2 or 3 million people at most.


You get no argument from me.  As I say repeatedly in the article, the LN is a killer-app for small value transactions.  I think it is a fantastic solution for that use case and it will be able to offload all of those mythical 'cups of coffee' transactions from the main chain.
What isn't realistic is thinking it can handle 100% of all economic activity requiring users to only open one channel every six months.


Centralization means that only large businesses will be able to provide the necessary liquidity for large scale use.  Those businesses will be subjected to regulation.  If you want to open a payment channel with any of those companies, get ready to provide your name, address, telephone number, social security number, and every other piece of personal information.
Once again, maybe for cups of coffee, we don't care?  But, clearly, it is not the same thing as bitcoin, and your identity will be tied to that channel and tracked.


None of my criticism was about the LN for small value transactions.  It handles that use case very well.

The system only obviously works for micro-payments.  How it works with larger amounts of value with channels opened for extended periods of time is unclear.


That is for the large value use case.  If a million people each want to open a bi-directional channel with a $2,000 limit each way, guess what, only major corporations can provide that kind of liquidity.

I don't know what truthcoin is.  I will have to go look it up.  But sidechains are considered an extension (layer) on top of the bitcoin network because they integrate directly with the main blockchain via two-way pegging.  
Ethereum, however, is an independent network which is completely disconnected from bitcoin.  The only thing Ethereum has to do with bitcoin is that they raised a $18 million dollars worth of bitcoins to fund their alt-coin.
If Ethereum merge-mined two-way pegged value against the cor bitcoin blockchain, then posts about it would be allowed and welcomed in this forum.  However, because it does not, it has the same status as any other unrelated alt-coin.

I think it is the next logical step.  We increase transaction capacity.  Enable new features.  Begin deploying layer-2 systems.  If we need to grow the core blocksize after that, then maybe that will and should happen.

@_date: 2017-04-14 22:03:41


I am confident that virtually everyone would use segwit for payment transactions and that most all popular wallets and payment providers are ready to support it.  So, I do believe it would provide immediate relief.
What, you aren't going to use segwit to pay for a cup of coffee if it gets you a lower fee?  
The reality is, people will use it for the majority of their payment transactions immediately once it is activated.
No, I'm not going to move my cold-storage coins to a segwit address.  I will move my spending money to a wallet that supports it, immediately.  And so will almost everyone else the community.

* The size of output scripts
* The other parts of the transaction data that aren't input and output scripts
As you can see, the largest portion of the transaction data is the input signature data. Our current average transaction size is about 600 bytes or so.
The second image is the same graph, but with the 25% discounted rate for signature data found in the input scripts.
As you can see we effectively shrink every transaction by nearly half size.
All data is based of the current state of the blockchain up to January 1, 2016.

@_date: 2016-02-06 19:43:03
Wow, you really don't understand the laws or restricted capacity?
Ok..let's try it this way.
We have a bus.  The bus is on a route and can carry a total of 1,000 passengers a day.  The bus runs 24/7 so, if people queue up, exactly at even intervals, throughout the entire day, morning noon and night, then 1,000 people could, indeed, ride the bus.  But, that isn't how people work.  They bunch up at particular times in the morning and in the afternoon.  Since there is not enough room for them, some people will end up getting to work extremely late.  If they can bump themselves up in priority, then the very, very, wealthy people will get to work on time, and those who are poorer will get fired from their jobs because they show up 8 hours or more late.
But...that isn't the situation we are describing.  What if 2,000 people want to ride the bus every day, but it can only carry a 1,000?  And the 'Central Core Planning Committee' simply **refuses** to allow more buses to run.  And, let's say the bus works like Uber surge pricing, and will take people in order of how much they are willing to pay.  With this replace-by-fee mechanism the richest 1,000 people will get to ride the bus, those who pay the most will wait the shortest amount of time to get a ride, and the others will also end up having to wait a very long time and be quite late.
But..and here is the point of restricted capacity.  What about the other 1,000 people.  **THEY DON'T EVER GET TO RIDE THE BUS AT ALL!!!**
When demand exceeds capacity, the whole system fails.
If you are expecting people to only open and close one payment channel every six months then, regardless of how much they 'replace by fee', the *average* wait time for the average person (not the uber wealthy) will be on the order of days, weeks, or even months.  Some won't *ever* be able to get a transaction process.
So, once again, can you not see how assuming a massive number of people can cycle the bitcoin blockchain just once every six months, using up 100% of the total capacity of the network will simply not work?
The Lightning Network *requires* that transactions be processed in a timely fashion or people will **LOSE THEIR MONEY**.
The point here is that even if all payment transactions are handled by the lightning network, the main bitcoin blockchain transaction capacity will have to be dramatically increased to support more users capable of opening and closing channels **in a timely fashion**.  A scenario that assumes 100% capacity of the network with a cycle time of once every six months will simply **NOT WORK**!

The government doesn't regulate nodes, they regulate businesses.  It is my belief that for the LN to scale (I'm not talking about using it for small amounts of value, but for transmitting large sums of money) that liquidity will only be able to come from very large businesses; like Coinbase, Circle, etc.
And those businesses *will* be regulated.  So, the only way to open a channel with them, will require AML/KYC.
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:39:10
I completely agree.  Our inflationary monetary system has a lot of negative effects.  Because our money inflates (becomes worth less over time) it creates a horrible feedback loop where people must *always* increase both consumption and production in a vicious cycle.
This is horribly destructive to the environment and creates a cycle where we must always produce and consume more and more simply to 'stay even'.  It also creates endless boom/bust cycles which most people accept as 'normal'; but not everyone agrees.
Most economists think this is an absolutely wonderful system and view the negative consequences (heavy debt, rampant production of garbage shit no one actually needs, and frequent and violent boom/bust cycles) as irrelevant.
These same economists view the mere concept of a deflationary currency as evil and destructive.
However, with a modestly deflationary currency, it actually encourages people to make products with real value that last.
I am not an economist.  I actually don't really have the answers to any of these problems.
However, I think in a free market of ideas we should at least be afforded the opportunity and free choice to decide which model we prefer.

I'm as excited about the LN as anyone, but repeating wildly exaggerated claims is not helpful.  You do understand that if the bitcoin blockchain is 100% saturated with tens of million people trying to open and close channels that there will be an eternal backlog resulting in confirmation times measured in weeks, if not months, right?  And, if confirmation times are that backed up then both the bitcoin and the LN are broken.
There has to be available capacity for any regular user to be able to open and close a channel with little to no delay for the LN to work.
Not that any of this matters, because getting tens of millions of active users of the bitcoin network is a pretty wild scenario to begin with.   There are only 15.2 million bitcoins ever created, and substantially less than that even available for people to purchase.  So, if we have 120 million people who all wanted to buy some bitcoin, they could each only own a small fraction of just one.
I think sometimes people forget just how tiny bitcoin is.
Stating that the LN offers a multiplier effect is sufficient, you don't need to make wild claims disconnected from reality.

The bitcoin network processes 91.25 million transactions per year. (250,000 transactions per day times 365).
91.25 million divided by 4 transactions per year equals 22.81 million people.
Your 50 million number is based on an assumption of a bitcoin network processing 7 transactions per second when the **actual**  network in the real world operates at 3.
If 100% of the entire capacity of the bitcoin network were being consumed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the average confirmation delay would be weeks if not months.
If the average confirmation time were weeks, or even months, then the Lightning Network would fail. It requires a responsive bitcoin network to execute closing transactions.
Making someone wait weeks or months to open or close a channel would be pointless.
Finally, your assumption that  people will only need to open one channel every six months is baseness. If that were the case that single channel would have to lock in six months of economic activity. No one has that kind of liquidity.
In reality users would probably open several channels every few weeks, corresponding with a regular pay period.
Your claims are based in a non existent fantasy world disconnected from reality.
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:22:53
I'm not sure I see that.  In the short term we would have segwit, which should offer a near doubling of transaction capacity.  This will enable layer-2 networks as well which should begin to migrate low-value use cases over to sidechains and LN.

No, that doesn't compute. LN still needs on chain transactions and is arguably only useful for low value payment transactions.
For us to onramp hundreds of millions of users will require sidechains to accommodate them.

How does growing bitcoin to support more users equal 'price drop'? It is just the opposite. The more people who can do on-chain transactions leads to increased adoption and corresponding price increase.

No doubt there is plenty of gray area for sure.  However, on the topic of alt-coins, we have been pretty rigid on that for quite a while.

Not everyone understands the distinction.

Those have all long since been sold I believe.  Biggest concentration of bitcoin in a single address is probably exchange cold storage or, possibly, long since lost wallets.

But you can cash out indirectly; meaning just sell the GBTC and buy the equivalent amount of bitcoin on the open market.  This works just fine.  The purpose of GBTC is so that you can buy and sell a bitcoin backed security via your standard stock trading platform and, ideally, get tax deferred exposure for retirement accounts.
The real question is whether or not GBTC will ever actually track the price of bitcoin.  There have been some serious allegations of fraud made in this thread already that I find disturbing.
How do we know that a share of GBTC actually represents 0.1 bitcoin?  Are we just taking this on faith?  Where are there proof of reserves in this whole thing?
There are still a lot of open questions about this OTC pink-sheet stock.

These images show a graph of unspent transaction outputs in the blockchain that are older than January 1, 2013.
As you can see, the total number of bitcoins which have not been spent in a long time has reached a steady state of 3.5 million bitcoins spread across 1.8 million UTXO's.
So, let's now compare this to the UTXO set from just 2009-2010
This image shows the number of UTXO's from 2009-2010 still unspent since 2014.
You will notice that on January 1, 2014 there were a little more than 44,000 UTXOs.  Over the past two years, about 1,000 of those UTXO's got spent, leaving us with a steady state of 43,000 unspent transaction outputs from 2009-2010 which have never been touched.
This graph is the most telling.  It shows a graph of the value of all UTXOs from 2009-2010 versus those from 2009-2013.
The relevant take-away is that the unspent transaction outputs from 2009-2010 remain almost completely untouched for the duration.  You can see it is almost a perfect flat-line of 2 million bitcoins.  These are generally assumed to belong to Satoshi and have never been spent.
The rest of the graph, which encompasses all UTXO's up to the end of 2013, accounts for an additional 1.5 million bitcoins.  These are bitcoins which all would have a cost basis dramatically below today's prices, and haven't been moved since prior to 2013.
So, this gives us 2 million bitcoins, presumably belonging to Satoshi, for which we have know way of knowing whether or not they will ever come back into circulation.  And, there is an additional 1.5 million bitcoins which have remained out of circulation since 2013.

I'm not trolling. This is a serious question. In the document you use the word "attack" repeatedly.
That's a highly loaded term.
To me this sounds like an 'optimization' which any software engineer would try to do.
How is this not merely an optimization? Why use such a loaded term as an 'attack'?
I totally get the fact that this is leading to increased centralization and blocking improvements, and that is a totally valid point. However, engineers are always going to optimize their hardware and code.

There is a lot of trust.  You have to trust that the network can safely manage your transactions, without losing or corrupting them.  You have to keep a *hot-wallet* at all times to participate in the network; subjecting yourself to risk of being hacked.  You have to trust that claiming transactions will be executed in a timely manner, which is probably the biggest piece of trust of all.  You have to trust it enough to tie up value for an extended period of time, while also subjecting yourself to volatility risk you might not accept otherwise.

The LN is only a scaling solution for the micro-transaction use case, and the bitcoin network doesn't even handle micro-transactions anymore.  So, it is a scaling solution for transactions not even supported by the bitcoin network.

Why is no one listening to what I'm saying?  I am not saying that OB should censor anything.  What I'm saying it that OB should make community tools such that the community which is using the network can curate the listings.
Without organizational tools, this will become a giant mess of noise and spam.  Let's ignore the issue of illegal stuff for a moment.  
If I go onto Ebay, or Etsy, or Amazon, I am presented with a beautiful interface that allows me to rapidly search for products and services.  A lot of people spent a lot of time making those interfaces.
If OB has no such interface, and a way to organize and display search results while also making sure people are not bombarded with noise, spam, porn, and all kinds of stuff they don't want to see, it will be unusable.
I'm a huge fan of the concept of a decentralized marketplace. However, I believe just as much work (if not more) has to be done in regards to how the marketplace is presented, searched, and accessed, as the reputation system for escrow services.
I'm even ok with the OB allowing 'illegal' stuff on it.  But....only so long as I can 'opt-out' and my node will *NEVER* see, store, or touch, any of that material I don't want to see.

Once we hit transaction capacity some things are going to have to give.  First, fees will rise substantially, which will push more and more people off of the main blockchain and they will instead use other solutions (alt-coins, coinbase, circle, paypal, credit cards, banks, fiat, etc.)
People will continue to use the main blockchain, but more as a way to store and protect wealth and less as a way to transact value.
From what I can gather from bitcoin-core, they have made absolutely no commitments that the average person should ever have direct access to the bitcoin network.
They view it as a way to store and protect wealth, a kind of internet fort-knox for rich people.
An Internet Fort-Knox is still another way for early holders to get rich, I suppose, but not necessarily what many people got into bitcoin for in the first place.

This shows three graphs which visualize the 'velocity' of bitcoin value.  The first one may be the most interesting.
It shows how the distribution of all unspent transaction outputs based on their age for the last year.
As you can see in the first graph, for 2015, around 500,000 bitcoins move every day, about a million bitcoins every week, and about two million every month.
This contrasts with the two million bitcoins which have never moved since 2010, and a total of 3.5 million bitcoins which have not been touched in over four years.

It is insulting that a ridiculously wealthy man, who made his fortune from bitcoin, now wants to attack those of us who still hold our value on the network today; simply because he lacks the technical understanding about how these things should be done safely.
The technical community as a whole, probably well over 90% of all people who have a fairly deep technical understanding of how bitcoin actually works, are in favor of layer-2 scaling rather than on-chain.

Yet another person who thinks that every single person can get a ride on a tiny bus, just so long as you let them bid up the price for a seat.  It doesn't work like that, of course.  No matter how much fees rise, only a few million people at most can use the bitcoin network on a semi-regular basis.
We haven't actually reached that limit yet.  Many on-chain transactions arguably could, or should, be priced out of the market.  Low value micro-transactions and dummy transactions simply used to mix coins.
If you remove all of that, there is room for growth on the main blockchain for now; but not for long.
The bitcoin blocksize limit constrains the maximum number of active users.  People need to know that the LN only helps scale payment transactions, it does absolutely nothing to scale for number of users.
Today, we don't really have two million people trying to regularly use the bitcoin network for on-chain transactions.  I would be surprised if it is much more than a couple hundred thousand people at most.
However, we certainly want to allow more users to have direct access to the blockchain in the long term.

The distinction is which network it runs on. You can make an exact copy of the bitcoin source code but merely modify which peers it will connect to and that makes it an alt-coin.

Thanks Paul. This is the exact same message I have been trying to communicate for a while. Rather then the community fracturing and fighting, sidechains offer a way for robust experimentation using the same token as everyone else.
It allows for frequent and safe hard-forks. Eventually spinning up a new sidechain should present no more challenge than spinning up an alt-coin today. Actually less.
Each sidechain could offer different features to match the needs of specific communities and use cases.
To me this is quite obvious as it matches how networks are scaled in other environments.
It's time to stop the fighting and conflict and focus everyone's energies towards a mutual shared goal of enhancing bitcoin for everyone.
If the time and effort already invested in controversial hard forks had gone into getting sidechains rolled out, we would be in a better place, but t it is hardly too late to redirect efforts now.
@_date: 2016-09-04 22:09:22
Right. But I think the difference is this. When there is a sudden drop in price, there tends to be a lot of panic selling even from generally inactive traders, because nobody knows where the bottom is. Even people not actively trading or sitting on the sidelines can freak out and sell on a massive market correction. However, when there is a large jump in price, those same people are usually happy to just stare at their paper profit.

Did you read my article?  LN transactions **are** bitcoin transactions. I was trying to dispel some misconceptions about LN, but I guess it didn't work if you think this.
The only thing the LN does is act as a match-maker to get two parties to sign a multi-sig transaction for funds deposited on the blockchain.

This statement is not true. The numbers on the document you reference are off by over an order of magnitude.
It would help in this discussion if people would stop using wildly exaggerated numbers which could never be achieved in the real world.
You claim that with 1mb blocks the bitcoin network could handle 120 million users (so long as they do their payment activity on the lighting network). 
The current real-world capacity of the bitcoin network today with 1mb blocks is about 250,000 transactions per day max. It takes two transactions minimum to use the Lighting Network; one to open the channel and another to close a channel. So, for 120 million people to each perform two transactions take 960 days (32 months) using 100% of the entire capacity of the bitcoin network
Days = (120000000*2) / 250000
With that many people trying to access the bitcoin blockchain, the average backlog to open or close a channel would be many, many, months.
As you should know, the Lighting Network is extremely time sensitive. Transactions to close out a channel have to be processed in a timely manner, or funds can be lost. The Lightning Network requires an uncongested bitcoin network to function.
In reality, people need to open and close more than one channel every 32 months. The average user will need to open multiple channels, and may need to close channels as their situation changes. When a user opens a channel they must ‘lock-in’ a certain amount of funds, and the amount locked-in by their channel gates the maximum value they can send or receive. No one can perfectly guess just how much money they need to tie up in a channel, so if they ever need to send or receive more money than the channel capacity, then they have to open a new channel.
In addition, if anyone is performing attacks on users of the Lightning Network, it may require closing the channel to avoid loss of funds.
So long as people keep repeating insane claims like 120 million people can use the bitcoin network with Lightning, we aren’t going to make any progress.
What are the actual real word numbers? Optimistically a low few million people can open and close channels on the bitcoin network on a semi-regular basis.

How is it relevant? Serious question.  I get how sidechains launching would be relevant.  I get how Lightning Network payment channels would be relevant.  But how is an alt-coin running on a completly independent network, disconnected from bitcoin in every way, have anything to do with bitcoin?  It's just another alt-coin.  
If you want to promote an alt-coin, that is fine, but it is against the rules of this sub-reddit to do so here.
Seriously, what in the world does Ethereum have to do with the bitcoin network? That is other than the fundraising which raised $18 million dollars worth of bitcoin.  As far as I am aware that is the only connection between the two.
Can I transfer bitcoins from the main bitcoin blockchain two-way pegged to the Ethereum network?  Can I move them back?  Can Ethereum help with scaling the bitcoin network?
If the Ethereum network provides for sophisticated smart contracts and other forms of programmable services, hey, I think that is just awesome.  However, that has nothing to do with the bitcoin network and should be discussed on not here.

Very well stated.  This needs to be repeated again and again.
Frankly, in an ideal world, bitcoin would run on a fully encrypted mesh network that would be capable of surviving independent of ISP's and the existing Internet.
We might even want much smaller blocks as well.
There is little recognition for how bitcoin is supposed to survive a truly concerted attack by state actors.  
This notion that you can just keep upping the blocksize limit, increasing bandwidth costs and putting a giant bulls eye on every node without consequence, is naive.
Those who argue for bigger-blocks-now, come hell or high water, have lost all concept of just how revolutionary bitcoin is. 
Today bitcoin has a market cap of only about $10 billion dollars and has very tightly regulated onramps and offramps.  In other words, today, it's a 'manageable' problem for the state.
However, if the market cap were to grow to a 100 billion dollars and people would stop bothering to convert to and from fiat (operating primarily in bitcoin alone and thereby circumventing most existing controls) the attacks from the state at that point would be severe.
Petty payment transactions can, and should, take place on layers built on top of bitcoin via other networks with different security requirements and acceptable levels of risk.
The primarily role of bitcoin should be to establish a way to store value that cannot be shut down or confiscated by the state.
I don't care if the state tracks my cup of coffee purchase, I do care if they try to track, block, whitelist, blacklist, or otherwise interfere with my wealth.

@_date: 2016-09-14 04:36:18
I didn't miss anything. So long as the core network is safe and protected then it can support an infinite number of transactions on secondary layers.
This isn't a question of whether or not bitcoin should scale, of course it should, it's whether or not is should scale on chain.

To be clear.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe the LN can upgrade seamlessly, even protocol breaking changes, while everyone has open nodes and etc.
Maybe...I don't know.
I do know that the devs shouldn't have to worry about those issues prematurely.
I can easily see a scenario where upgrading the software is resisted by the community because it would break their current software they already had deployed live.  And I think we shouldn't have to deal with those problems yet.

The most likely scenario is that it breaks a bunch of stuff people have been developing on the mainnet, and the community resists an upgrade. Or the network is partially upgraded and bad things happen.
The simple point is this all just becomes a distraction and waste of time for the LN developers if people are using software on a live network when they didn't yet announce it was ready.
They shouldn't be put in support position or have to solve all of these upgrade/deployment problems now if they aren't ready.

I understand that the node has to sign transactions; of course.  That doesn't mean that private keys have to sit around in 'cleartext'.
Let me give you just one example of how this could/would work.
You could have a hardware device, like a Trezor, which does the actual signing.
At least this would mean only your exact physical machine could do signing because only your machine would have the trezor plugged into it.
Of course, this still wouldn't prevent someone from infecting your node with a virus, but at least it would secure you from trivial copying of your private key since it would never be visible on the machine or internet at any time.

Huh?  China is cracking down on the Chinese, like they always do.  What does that have to do with bitcoin, or the 'entire bitcoin ecosystem'?
If you mean it's a threat to extreme mining centralization in China, I say good riddance.  The extreme centralization of mining in China has never been a good thing.
By design the bitcoin network will adapt to any major drop in hashing power.  Losing bitcoin mining will have no long lasting negative effect on bitcoin and, frankly, is probably a positive in the long run.
One single person in China controlled far too much bitcoin hashing power.  That was never a 'good thing'.  This company also created a hacked version of the SHA256 algorithm and created a hostile fork of the bitcoin software solely so it would work with his hacked hardware.  Again, good riddance.


If bitcoin cannot survive an authoritarian government banning it, then it doesn't deserve to exist.
I create video games for a living.  Have you ever tried to get a video game published in China?  You wouldn't believe the shit you have to go through.

S2X does not have replay protection, unlike BCH.
The signers of the NYA have no intention of listing S2X as anything other than BTC, which includes the largest exchanges and largest number of non-technical users. Users who hold bitcoin on custodial accounts, the vast majority, will never get a choice. Coinbase will decide for them and cite 'majority hashpower' as the rationale​.
Saying this is 'just like bitcoin cash' is untrue. This is very, very, different.
If these actors added replay protection and listed S2X as an alt, I would agree with you, but this is a much more serious thing.

Governments making bitcoin illegal has, and continues to be, the number one threat to bitcoin. 
Our only hope is that by now enough millionaires and billionaires have sufficient skin in the game to prevent it.
Not enough people have done this thought experiment though.
Imagine if bitcoin was highly regulated, with whitelists and blacklists. Heck, maybe owning your own bitcoin was considered illegal and you could only transact through third parties with full AML/KYC. Yet, the government still allowed it to exist as a store of value.
Even in that highly corrupted state, it would still be better money than all fiat currencies.

However, to be truly 'trustless' you would have to review every line of source code both in the bitcoin software and whatever other pieces of software you use (wallet, paper-wallet generator, etc.).
The reality is that this is beyond the capacity of most.

I think that is a fair question. The main reason is that there is actually no screaming emergency to raise the blocksize limit that high now, and certainly not through a hard fork. There are other ways to increase transaction capacity.

Something not everyone knows. 
People often assume that a bitcoin transaction corresponds to sending money from person A to person B.
Yes, this is true in the simple common use case, where maybe you are sending bitcoin from your personal wallet to somewhere else.
However, the way a bitcoin transaction is constructed it can be composed of many inputs and, more importantly, many outputs.
As we encourage more and more companies, and even individuals, to implement transaction batching, what happens is they construct a transaction with many, many, outputs. 
This results in a more efficient usage of the bitcoin network.
As transaction batching increases it may appear that the 'total number of transactions' on the bitcoin network is going down when, in fact, they are actually dramatically increasing because each output is essentially a logical 'transaction' in and of itself.
We need to get various websites and other places which report network metrics to revise their graphs to show the total number of outputs processed daily to get a much more accurate measure of network throughput.

Whether it's 'most', 'some, or just the ones who are part of DCG, they are still businesses.  Businesses subject to full AML/KYC and the full force of government regulations.
You really want to set a precedent that a group of businesses, with cooperation of some miners, can change the consensus rules of bitcoin?  
If they do it once, and can still 'call it bitcon', then the government can compel them to implement full AML/KYC, whitelists and blacklists on-chain.
In what world is 'all of the fully regulated businesses' changing the consensus rules a 'good idea'?


It is the entire technical community.  'Core' means the devs actually contributing to the github repot.  They are the technical community. 


Full nodes represent the community.  That's the only way the community can fully validate their own transactions and make sure that the miners and bad actors are not cheating.  People who don't run full-nodes or otherwise waive their right to securing their own transactions are not very relevant.
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:15:25
Except that they own most of the bitcoin users and they define what is 'bitcoin'. There are far more bitcoin users who only operate under 3rd party custodial control than those who control their own private keys and even fewer who run a full node.
I believe they think they can get away with this because they control the majority of users and their bitcoin. That's why they won't implement replay protection. They fully intend to tell their users that their chain is the real bitcoin and the minority chain is just a bunch of butthurt internet trolls.
Honestly, I think they are going to get away with it.

That would be pretty dangerous advice. BCH is much more volatile than bitcoin and in a death spiral due to it's rapid rate of inflation and no fees. Plus, with yet another hard fork looming, it is liable to crash due to being irrelevant. It has effectively no development team and only exists because certain people are propping it up.
Most of us sold our BCH to increase our bitcoin holdings by 10-15%.

* The dev team at no point ever agreed to the NYA.  Ever.
* The 'big block' crowd **just** created their own hard fork of the bitcoin network with their own development team.  There is no reason in any way, shape, or form, for there to be **another** hard fork now.
The entire purpose behind the NYA was a 'compromise' to avoid a hard fork.
Well, guess what, there was no compromise.  The community split!  When BCH launched, it was a decision by the community to 'go their separate ways'.  One with big blocks, no segwit, and a new development team.  The other, with the original dev team and roadmap.
The BCH HF changed everything.  Instead of of any hope for a 'compromise' there was a split.
There is no reason for yet another a hardfork at this time.  Period.  Full stop.

They are not the 'same side' when they have none of the technical community and almost none of the end user community.
What they are attempting to do is 'fire the core developers' and place the entire project under their direct control.  
Even if they 'mean well', the bottom line is that these are all businesses subject to extreme government regulations.  Having demonstrated that they now completely own and control the bitcoin network (which is what this fork would mean in no uncertain terms) they could be compelled and required by law to implement full **on-chain** AML/KYC, whitelists, and blacklists.
These are not things that you 'compromise' on; and that is why the technical community and most of the user community is so against this.

The new weak hands don't own much bitcoin.
Back in the old days, whenever there was a substantial price dip, I would by 10 to 20 bitcoin.  Later, I would buy 1 to 5 bitcoin on a price dip.
Today, even when bitcoin dropped 'really low', it would have cost me over $6,000 just to buy **two**.
I find it doubtful that anyone with significant bitcoin holdings (&gt;100 btc) is going to be 'freaking out' any time soon.  If you've been on this ride for 4+ years, you've seen it all and know well the long term value proposition.

Control is a group of corporations with cooperation from some large mining pools taking over the software and in effect the network.
All of those actors can be compelled by governments. In fact, they already are. So demonstrate just once that you can change the network, without cooperation from the decentralized developers and end users, then you now 'own it'. 
The only fix for this is if mining was not so centralized, but it is. We have warned of mining centralization for years, now it's happening.

I did do stuff with the money. The first time I bought an Acura NSX. Another time it was GBTC that I sold to increase my 401k. Another time I paid off all of my kids student loans.

A weak hand is someone who gets into bitcoin and, the first sign they are showing a paper loss, they freak out and sell (at a loss).
Bitcoin should be considered a 'long term' investment by anyone who gets into it.  With a timeline measured in years, not months, weeks, or days.
Bitcoin trades differently than the stocks your average investor is used to.  
Stocks trade on well regulated exchanges during a civilized set of hours during the weekdays.
Bitcoin trades 24 hours, seven days a week, in a largely unregulated environment which is comprised of professional stock traders who prey on the weak.  It trades on dozens of exchanges all over the planet, presenting rapid flows of capital as people try to arbitrage between them.
These traders will find your weaknesses, any emotion the herd might be manipulated into, and leave you weeping.  These guys are sharks of the highest order.
Even a seasoned stock trader can be humiliated by the bitcoin markets and watch their bitcoin quickly dribble through their hands.
The only sound strategy is to buy bitcoin, keep buying bitcoin, and wait for years.
If you want to make a quick turn around profit in these shark infested waters, you better know what the hell you are doing.  Trading on emotion will get you wreckt!

So, the 3-4% number comes the fact that investments often have major price corrections.  So, yeah, you might make 7, 8, 10% some years.  But, you need to do that to offset the major crashes which inevitably happen as well.  
The logic is that a 3% withdrawal rate has been proven to be 'safe' to never lose any principal over an indefinite timeline.

What's with the 'temporarily' will result in two chains comment?  **temporarily**?
Bitcoin Cash still exists months later.  Ethereum Classic still exists more than a year later.
What is this 'temporarily' all about?
Personally, I hope it's 'temporary', too.  Well, actually, I hope the idiots behind S2X just call the whole thing off when they see the writing on the wall.  There is zero reason to sustain that failed project now, or in the future.

I will add to this.  My background is in video games.  Trying to get a video game approved in China is Kafkaesque to say the least.  Let me give you one example.  A game studio tried to get a popular boxing game approved in China.  When the boxer would land a heavy blow, the screen would flash red, indicating his pain.  China's ministry of culture required it to flash blue; since red could be perceived as blood I guess.  If anything in your video game could be perceived as political, even in the most minuscule form, it would be banned.   Only the softest, safest, most watered down game for small children can get approved, and even then you will have to change a lot of stuff.
That's just how controlling they are over the most trivial of things.

You have to explain the difference between investing in any tech company before it has any earnings and investing in bitcoin. It's investing in the future potential of the tech either way.

I completely agree with this.  If we keep fracturing the network all of the time, I don't see how that can be considered a positive.
Bitcoin was supposed to always just have 21 million coins.
But now it's going to have 21 million BCH coins and 21 million BTC coins and soon 21 million S2X coins.  
How anyone can spin that as a net positive, I don't get at all.  This has created nothing but chaos and confusion.  Our supposedly finite immutable bitcoin is undergoing frequent mitosis!

I'm lucky it hasn't been banned or made illegal. I'm lucky a competing cryptocurrency hasn't taken over.
But, I could buy any stock and face the same exact risk profile.
If I buy a pharmacuitical stock and their drug works and gets approved was that all 'luck' too?
I really fail to see the distinction. Personally I know of tons of stocks I consider vastly more risky than bitcoin.
Sure. It was 'luck' in the same way anytime you buy a really well researched stock and it does well it is also 'luck'. 
Why is it if it's a stock I researched thoroughly and it does well that makes me a 'savvy investor' but if it's bitcoin it's gambling?
I don't buy that. It's either all savvy investing or all gambling.

Yes.  Didn't everyone who bought in back then?


No, it most certainly was not.  No risk, no reward.  That's how all investing works.


No.  Luck had zero to do with it.  Luck is buying a lottery ticket and your numbers getting called.  Luck is winning a big poker hand.
Investing in something you have the vision to see could be a big thing is not luck.  That's like saying the guys who invested in Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft early were 'lucky'.  They were not lucky.  The were visionaries who saw the growth potential of that market and accepted risk for a possible large reward.
That is exactly what I did with bitcoin.  I am a software engineer.  I didn't invest in bitcoin until I had, obviously, first read the white-paper.
Then I downloaded the bitcoin software, built it on my computer, and reviewed the source code.
Did you do that?  I did.
Then I wrote my own bitcoin software so I could understand the technology in great detail.
Did you do that?
Did that make me 'lucky'?
No, that made me an extremely informed early investor who saw the potential of this technology.  I invested my time and energy to thoroughly understand this technology years before other people did.  That is not luck!

One way would be something like this. Create a bip38 encrypted cold storage wallet.  For the password, use a phrase from a book. How that password is formed should be unique (first letter of every other word, or some other combination).
Convey this information to your loved ones but **not** the name of the book.
In a safe deposit box, which can only be opened upon your death, leave the paper wallet and the name, chapter, paragraph, of the book which unlocks the code.
Only your loved ones will know how to recover the password with that information.

It's worth mentioning that selling any of your bitcoin for USD triggers a taxable event (at least in the US).

Almost nobody.  Except I have made entire huge blog posts about the topic and point it out here on a constant basis.  But, yeah, 'nobody'.
The thing is, this isn't **YET** a big problem.  LN is a multiplier.  It increases capacity dramatically and enables new forms of economic activity, in particular micro-transactions, which were never really viable on the bitcoin network.
There is no blocksize big enough to accommodate true exponential scale for billions of users.  It's simply not going to happen, ever.  Nor should it.
You don't scale networks by throwing bigger and bigger computers at the problem.  You can only scale linearly by a certain amount.  To scale exponentially you need parallelism, and in the case of bitcoin, parallelism will come in the form of sidechains.
But, again, this is not a short term problem.  In the short term things like the LN will provide a significant multiplier effect much larger than a simple linear blocksize increase could.

To be clear, ASICBOOST uses a *hacked* version of SHA256.  To be a true implementation of SHA256 it should be able to take **any random block of data** and compute the hash.  That's not what ASICBOOST does.  They found a consistent pattern in bitcoin data and optimized around that pattern (i.e. not random).
So, as soon as anyone made a change to the bitcoin protocol (further randomizing the input) their **cheat** failed.
All miners are obligated to perform a full valid SHA256 hash.

Here is what you do as I understand it. Segwit2x does have **optional** replay protection.
So, first, of course, directly control all of your private keys.
After the fork happens, load the Segwit2x wallet **with optional replay protection enabled**.
Import your keys and 'spend' all of the bitcoin by sending them to new keys you control.
Once done, your old keys are no longer spendable on the S2X branch because they have already been spent.
You can now submit transactions on the bitcoin network using the old keys safely because the transactions cannot be replayed on the S2X chain.
Now, this is an obscene burden to put on the end user but I guess that is the price we pay for being attacked.

@_date: 2017-09-19 17:55:40
They can but...
Why would they?
Bitcoin, at it's core, is a technology that cannot be suppressed or 'un-invented'.  The powers that be realize it is here to stay.  They will continue to find ways to 'manage' the problem, as they are doing now by heavily regulating bitcoin exchanges.
Currently bitcoin is primarily a speculative instrument.
There is a strong possibility that bitcoin might be exposed to a very wide investor class (it has not yet).
If bitcoin were to be available for trade on well regulated exchanges like Schwabb, Etrade, Fidelity, FOREX, etc., then what would likely happen is the vast majority of all bitcoin in the world would end up there.  
This is already happening to some extent today.  Certain individuals and companies already own the lions share of all of the bitcoin in the world.
Once the majority of all bitcoin is sitting in IRAs, 401ks, and brokerage accounts, it really doesn't represent a significant 'problem' for governments.

A hard fork is bad enough. A hard fork without replay protection is suicidal.
The price has increased 400% this year and they want to throw all of that away by starting a cluster fuck hard fork now!

The math works out.. there are 363,762,732 pounds of gold in the world.  If you divide that by 21 million, it works out to about 17 pounds of gold for the equivalent distribution as one bitcoin.
Bitcoin already seems 'too expensive' to most people.  As the price rises, this perception will only get worse.
We don't quote the price of gold in pounds, or even tens of pounds, we do it in ounces.  
Today, one millibit is only $6.15.  
Or, putting it another way, buying one bitcoin is the same thing as owning 17 pounds of gold.

Miners follow the price. One bitcoin is worth about $4,300. One S2X coin is worth nothing at this time because it has no market value yet.
If the market continues to value bitcoin at a much higher price that is where hash rate will move.
I don't think S2X is a good idea, but I admit it is in people's right to create it.
Just do it fairly and legally. List it as a new coin on the exchanges and let the market decide.
What if hashpower switches between the two chains weekly as price discovery occurs.
Will you rename the tokens every time hashpower moves back and forth?
At the end of the day users give a token value and miners follow profit.
Give S2X the koolaide test. List it on exchanges and if people value it over BTC, more power to you.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:24:24

For your own protection when you transmit either BTC or B2X to a customer you want to make sure that you yourself do not suffer loss due to replay protection correct? Is it not your intention to split all BTC that you control or receive so they are immune to replay attacks?
When users send you funds, and their submission can be replayed, while that isn't technically your responsibility it will lead to customer complaints will it not?

They can hard fork. They just cannot call it bitcoin or steal people's money.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:26:39
Your live and let live attitude would be fine...if...S2X had replay protection and the S2X supporters did not make it abundantly clear that their goal is not to co-exist peacefully side by side with BTC competing fairly in the marketplace but, rather, to **destroy** the BTC chain, starve it to death, kill it, and take over it's exchange symbol.
They are not playing nice.  Signalling has merit, and that's what my post calls for.  I find it hard to believe that 95% of the miners really want S2X to happen.  They should start signalling their opposition now, so that talking point can go away.
To sit idly by and do nothing, just assuming everything will all just work out fine, is not the right approach.  We should continue to build consensus opposition to this hard-fork on all fronts.
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:28:30
What's particularly telling is that this hard-fork is so rushed that exchanges cannot even come close to being prepared for it in time.  If that doesn't prove some kind of fucking point, I don't know what does.
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:56:04
Eric, if you destroy the BTC chain then you destroy my money. I didn't buy S2X coin I bought BTC.
Add strong replay protection and let the free market decide. Otherwise this is an attack with the explicit intent of destroying the BTC chain.
Yes, I control my own private keys to the BTC chain. If you destroy that chain you have stolen my money and replaced it with an inferior token. 
Even if the BTC chain survives, without replay protection I can have my money stolen in replay attacks.
Of course you already know all of these things. You are being disingenuous, one might even say 'toxic'.

Because a small group of corporations subject to full government financial regulations will have taken over the project. 
This sets a dangerous precedent.
It sets the precedent that this well regulated group of corporations now 'control' the bitcoin software with cooperation of a group of miners.
Having set this precedent governments can then legally compel them to add full AML/KYC, blacklists, and whitelists, to the network.
They **can no longer claim 'we can't do that'**!!
If you demonstrate you directly control bitcoin just once, that means you own it.
This is irrefutable and anyone who has read the history of PayPal (which originally intended to be much more like bitcoin) can see it as true. 
For those who don't know:
* AML stands for 'anti-money laundering'
* KYC stands for 'know your customer'
* Whitelists are pre-approved users of the network which get preferential treatment (corporations and banks)
* Blacklists are people the government suspects of being a bad actor and are blocked from using the network
Realize that most of the signers of the NYA are already subject to these regulations which they must apply to their customers.
However, since currently they can claim 'no can control' over the bitcoin network itself they cannot be compelled to censor transactions.
Once Segwit 2X activates that will no longer be true.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:26:51
Well, they may be, time will tell.  But bitcoin cash is different; it was a new asset that people did not previously buy/own.  This is about someone converting an existing asset BTC, into a new asset S2X, without permission from the property owners.  Not quite the same thing.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:37:24
Sadly, very sadly, you are wrong.
If S2X gets 90% hash-rate, and has no replay protection, and all exchanges including Gemini, Coinbase, BitPay all follow the S2X chain, I 100% guarantee you that they will call that 'bitcoin'.
This is the reality we are faced with right now.  S2X has *no* replay protection, so the legacy chain will likely die.

I explain that bank's computers can be hacked. That the bank has complete control over your funds and can freeze your money or the government can even garnish it.
With bitcoin, instead of your money being stored on one computer, it is stored on tens of thousands of computers spread around the world and cannot be hacked because it is protected by immutable math. If someone were to try to cheat or steal your money, 'the math wouldn't add up' and all of these computers collectively would reject it.
So long as you control your own password safely your money can never be stolen, frozen, or confiscated.
No one who has safely protected their own bitcoin password has ever lost money using bitcoin because you can't hack math.

Fair points all.  That said, bitcoin certainly benefits from the co-operation of a number of actors.
How all of these bitcoin businesses, representing a huge percentage of the bitcoin economy, could sign onto an agreement without involvement or co-operation from the actual software engineering team rather boggles my mind.
I already sent an email to Coinbase about my concerns.
This seems incredibly reckless, and I think it's fair to call all of the signatories of this 'agreement' to issue a new statement that acknowledges that the reasons for the original NYA are no longer valid (i.e. 'bringing the community together').
The community split in half with the BCH hard fork.
Splitting again now would be wildly irresponsible in my opinion.

What doesn't make sense?
The market is rejecting S2X.  Once the uncertainty of it is removed, the price of bitcoin will likely rise dramatically.  By defeating this hard-fork attack, bitcoin will have demonstrated, yet once again, it's ability to ward off attackers who might try to change the consensus rules against the will of the economic majority.
This is extremely bullish for bitcoin and those who launched the attack in the first place own a tremendous amount of bitcoin, so they will, in the end, greatly financially benefit from the defeat of S2X.
On the other hand, if a contentious split actually occurs and creates market confusion and disruption, the price would fall.  So, for the S2X guys, failure is success (at least financially if not ideologically).

I guess what I'm saying is that a brokerage account also functions as a savings account.  You can hold a cash position in it if you want.  I just think it makes way more sense to hold a high dividend paying blue-chip stock than earning essentially nothing in a conventional bank savings account.

It's behaving as a form of arbitrage. It's so easy to move between alts that traders are going to chase every price movement. I kind of expected this.
It's for this reason that I think that litecoin could actually function similarly to a pegged sidechain. It wouldn't really be pegged but market forces could keep them in sync enough to be usable. Meaning you could use litecoin for low value payments and bitcoin as your savings account.

If the bitcoin network is starved of hash-rate; and blocks stop getting created for months, this would, in fact, kill the current chain.
If you did an emergency HF POW change, well you have just created your own fork-coin and they would declare themselves victor and insist their fork-coin is the 'real-bitcoin'.
With enough hashpower (and who knows if they really have miner support to get away with this) it could, in fact, be devastating to bitcoin.
This is why it is so important for miners to signal their true intentions now.
If S2X gets 50% of hashrate and BTC gets 50%, then things are going to be fine.  If S2X gets 95% of hashrate and BTC only 5%, they will kill our chain.  You might think, 'miners won't go against their economic interests', but there are other forces at work here.  Governments and businesses are influencing things with huge amounts of power and leverage; backroom deals could be being made to assure miners to mine at a loss long enough to kill the BTC chain.
These are real threats!

I might add though, it's very tempting to do the following.  Take the amount of bitcoin you own, divide it by how long you think you have left to live, and see how much value that is annually.
Since I'm already 56 years old, I figure living another 30 years is pretty damned optimistic (men in my family don't tend to age well).
For me bitcoin is *already* at a price level that I could live on cashing out just 1/30th of my holdings per year.  Not to live well, but to get by.
It's a fun calculation to do.

If this fork dies, in spectacular fashion ideally, this will end up being one of the great moments in the history of bitcoin; that it was able to repel a corporate takeover attempt.

The difficulty is a value which adjusts, on average, once every two weeks.  It is designed to generate one new block, on average, once every ten minutes.  Other cryptos generate a new block at a much faster rate.

A lot of times a programmer will say something like 'that took me 10 minutes' and they are referring to the time they spent actually changing a couple of lines of code.  However, review, testing, multi-platform support, and deployment can easily make a few line code change take days or even weeks.

Mining difficulty is correlated to the price of bitcoin.

I did once at 185.  It then went to 255 which was an obscene premium and I sold for a very tidy profit.  Since then the premium has been so irrationally disconnected from the underlying asset I have never been tempted to buy back in.  If the premium ever came back down to the 20-30% range I **might** consider it, but it's just too out of wack for me to feel comfortable.
Instead I just bought some more bitcoin directly and I think if I want to invest more, I'll just keep doing that.

You act like 'majority hash rate' is a persistent and irreversible state.
Can you explain to me why miners would mine a worthless coin like S2X?
If nobody wants S2X (which is becoming abundantly clear) miners won't mine it.
All hard-forks must have replay protection.  All hard-forks represent a new token.  Whether that token captures market dominance or not is for the free market to decide, not miners.
People do not value a coin based on how much hash-rate it has.

Not once does Eric or Xapo talk about market price.  They only talk about hashrate.  And, even market price can move back and forth for an extended period of time with no definitive winner.  We can't keep renaming chains every time hashrate or price moves around.  The name of the token is defined by the consensus rules; that is the only thing which is stable and unchanging.  Once you break/fork you have created a new token.
Their entire assumption is based on the notion of **killing** the BTC chain.  This is evident by the lack of strong replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-11 03:06:36
I got into bitcoin at around a $100.
I have seen a 48x increase in value on my investment.
Guys who got in way earlier than me, at a dollar, have seen a 4,800x increase in value. Pretty crazy to think about.
Today, imagining just another 10x increase in value to $50,000 seems kind of insane. Maybe it could happen.
But the days of 20x, 50x, 100x gains from the current price seem to be over.
If bitcoin ever begins to approach a trillion dollars in value it will be a radically different beast than what we have seen to date.
It will start destroying weak currencies at that price level, for example.
I would love to imagine we might see more than another 10x growth, but even that seems mighty speculative.
All that said, eventually we want the price to stabilize, smooth out, and appreciate at a much more gradual (but steady) pace.

You are correct it is 'fair game' to take advantage of the system in any way you can, and if the system fails then it fails.
What you cannot claim, however, is 'overwhelming consensus' when clearly there is not.
The idea that miners determine consensus is the biggest load of horse-shit I have heard all day.  The users of the network enforce the rules against bad actors.

If they have majority hash power they can kill the existing chain. They will simply call S2X the 'real' bitcoin and since it will be the only functioning network they will get away with it.  We have no EDA to keep the current chain alive.
Bitcoin was designed to keep alive the chain with majority hash power. They will state that legally they are on the 'valid' chain.
There is literally almost nothing we can do about it other than raise holy hell while being ignored.
They have the winning hand.
This will be a completely successful 51% attack.

@_date: 2017-09-28 17:02:27
I have yet to see how people profit from some of their actions.  Miners mining at a loss.  People creating hard-fork drama intentionally which is depressing the price.
People refusing to add replay protection to their hard fork when they 100% know that will throw the market into absolute chaos.  Where is the profit motive for that behavior?
My point being, not everyone seems to be acting purely on profit motive and self interest.  There's a lot of squirrelly behavior out there.
This is why I always make my bias clear when I write posts. My bias is that I primarily use bitcoin as a store of value.  Due to the incredible success of bitcoin I now have a huge amount of my personal wealth tied up in it.  I care far more about my wealth being protected as a stable store of value, than I do accommodating cups of coffee transactions on-chain.
See there, I make my motivations clear.  It comports with my arguments and behavior.  Some people, I can't figure out what they are fighting for.
For example, Ver goes and creates his very own private big-block hard-fork of bitcoin that he insists on claiming is 'the real bitcoin' but, rather than going off and enjoying his new found giant blocks, he won't shut the fuck up about our small-block network.
Some people's motivations are still very murky and unclear.

No, it was because to me the **current** price of $6,000 already feels like this.  I got into bitcoin under $100; so I've already experienced a 60x price increase.  Going to $45,000 would *'only'* be another 7.5x.
I expect the same pattern to repeat itself at all price levels, simply because it has always been that way.  Listen to the real old-timers who talk about the 'terrible crash of bitcoin' when it went from $3 to back under $1.
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:10:37
Hysterical. Bitcoin can upgrade extensively using soft forks without causing a chain split. It's splitting the chain that is the problem. 
Things which happened way back when in the chains infancy don't necessarily directly apply to a chain protecting tens of billions of dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:55:41
My yardstick is, and for a very long time has been, about 5-10% of gold.  Nobody is going to give up their gold completely, it's been a store of value for 5,000+ years.  But I do think bitcoin could siphon off about 5-10% because of the advantages it offers.
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:23:37
You are right, this is certainly one scenario how it could play out.
However, it would be far better if the fucking hard-fork never launched at all to begin with.  It's more drama, bad media attention, confusion, will lead to loss of funds by some parties, it will be a giant mess even if your optimistic scenario plays out.
Far better to prevent the fork from happening in the first place, and there is still time to do that.

You are assuming the new chain will get all of the hashing power.  It may, or it may not.  The community is very divided on this point.
However, you need to remember that miners will only mine a token if it makes them money.
If the S2X coin is worthless, they are not going to mine it, plain and simple.
There is likely to be tremendous market volatility during price discovery (the period of time when a new asset or two competing assets in this case, undergo rapid changes in value as the market tries to decide 'what they are worth').
We could literally see a situation where the price fluctuates dramatically between the two tokens on a rapid basis, as whales start moving massive amounts of money around.  Realize that the people who set the market price are traders, not normal mortal human beings like me and you.  We just sit here and calmly hold our bitcoins, because we are not professional day traders and would just lose all of our bitcoin if we tried.
Traders love this kind of volatility.  Fortunes will be made and lost, quite literally, in **minutes**.
Meanwhile, while the price of the two tokens is changing dramatically, so too will the miners switch which coin they are hashing.  Miners will always mine the token that earns them the most money.
It really doesn't matter how many miners are 'signaling' segwit2X.  If the market thinks a segwit2x token isn't worth much, then miners will stay on the current chain.
Which chain has the 'majority hashing power' could literally change on a daily basis!
People who act like miners just make some decision and blindly mine the coin that matches for, I don't know, their personal sense of ethics or something, don't understand the situation.
Miners work for us.  They perform a service and are paid a fee in return.  They have zero loyalty to any specific token, only the one that makes them the most money.
It's important to note, getting back to your original question, that even as hash rate flies back and forth between the two chains, based on market price, this won't slow down trading that much.  
Even while the whole community is telling everyone 'get your bitcoin off of the exchanges', the traders won't be doing this.  The brave ones know that there are fortunes to be made.  They will have large amounts of bitcoin sitting on the exchange already.  They will also have USD and other fiat balances; as well as other cryptos because there is a lot of money to be made between them as well.  Trading which happens on exchanges doesn't touch the blockchain, except for deposits and withdrawals.
So the trading will happen unabated.
If 50% of the hashpower goes to the S2X coin and 50% hashpower goes to bitcoin, then both chains will slow down by half until the next difficulty adjustment; which will take weeks.
If one chain has 90% hashpower, then the chain with just 10% will take much longer to adjust and getting transactions processed will slow down dramatically.  
When S2X launches, this outcome is not going to be determined by which chain some miners point their hashpower at, it will be determined by market forces and miners will simply point their hashrate at whichever one makes them the most money.

The first time Gavin Andreesen proposed a hard fork to raise blocksize (to 20mb!!!) the moderators of treated any discussion of that hard-fork attempt an 'alt-coin' and largely blocked people from talking about it and many members, angry about that, started getting banned.
Back at that time, I was actually a moderator on and I disagreed with that decision.  In my view, Gavin was making a proposal for the community to discuss, and I figured we should be let that happen.
I quit as a moderator of once I recognized that I couldn't support that moderation policy.
I was then invited to be a moderator of It was intended to be a censorship free forum for discussion all things bitcoin.
I stayed a moderator there for quite some time.  However, virtually all 'uncensored' and largely 'unmoderated' message forums will, over time, degenerate into a cesspool of trolling, personal attacks, and largely become dysfunctional.
This is exactly what happened.  As time went on, in my view, that community become more and more toxic.  I also studied the issues surrounding the risks of hard-forks and raising the blocksize and, in educating myself, I become convinced that the path the current core developers are on was the right technical approach. 
I am a software engineer myself and, in the past, I have worked on medical software which was very fault-intolerant; so I can respect a highly conservative and cautious approach, especially when it comes to a network protecting billions of dollars.
I eventually resigned as moderator of because the place was no longer functioning and my being a moderator there, rather than doing some good, was actually creating a problem.  Worse yet, I no longer felt the sub had much of anything to do with 'censorship' and was just a dysfunctional cesspool of hate and trolling.  
From what I gather today, there is a substantial percentage of the bitcoin community (around 25%) which deeply disagrees with the current set of developers working on the bitcoin software.
They want to 'take it back' and they are going to great lengths to accomplish that.  
This has been a kind of 'civil war' in bitcoin that has been going on for years.
However, on August 1st of 2017 this '25% of the community' launched their very own hard fork of bitcoin which addressed all of their concerns.  This new version 'fired the core developers', it 'removed the offensive segregated witness code', and 'increased the blocksize dramatically'.
In short, they got everything that they wanted, except the market value of bitcoin.
It also, on day one, demonstrated a mind-boggling degree of technical incompetence, by introducing a poorly designed and thought out 'emergency difficulty adjustment' algorithm which is causing the slow death of that token.
So, now this same 25% of the community wants to hijack bitcoin again, this time using a much more direct head-on attack.
Why they couldn't just take their bitcoin-cash hard fork and go their own way, I truly have no idea.  Almost everyone on the majority side of the community are ok with that.  Have your hard fork, do with it as you will.
There are a bunch more details about miners and other stuff, but that's the basic history of things.

Stupid analogy.  The 'population' is the users and economic majority; who are by an overwhelming majority against S2X.  The analogy here would be like a group of corporations going into a private meeting and deciding who should be president.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:18:41
My understanding is that S2X has 'optional' replay protection.
So you would launch the S2X client with replay protection enabled. Import your keys and send them to new S2X only addresses.
It should then be safe to submit transactions on the real bitcoin network, since on the S2X network they have already been spent.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:51:47
Transactions are already censored in a sense. By the same companies which are trying to push this fork through. People are kicked off of Coinbase every day. That's already censorship. Just wait until these companies are legally compelled to do that onchain too.

What are you talking about? That's the current active **non-forked** chain.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:13:42
On what legal basis do you think you can fork a blockchain and take the exchange symbol and users funds?
It cannot be 'majority hashpower' because at this point there will be three active bitcoin chains with hashpower sloshing between them. If hahspower moved back to the original chain a week later, what are you going to do? Rebrand again? Refund users funds?
What if between all three forks (probably soon to be dozens now that fork wars has started) *none* have 'majority' hashpower?
Do you mean just the top two? The two most recent?
Look, you can fork. I get that. But you can't steal the exchange symbol and exchanges which hold custodial funds cannot automatically convert them to the new fork. That would be theft.

If I have a channel open and I want to be able to send up to $4,000 worth of bitcoin on it. Then myself and another party have to commit $4,000 worth of value.
If I commit $4,000 then I can send it, but I cannot receive any because the channel is unbalanced in that direction.
If the person I opened the channel with commits $4,000 then I can receive but send any money.
If he commits $2,000 and I commit $2,000 then I can only send or receive a maximum of $2,000 initially.
If I ever want to send or receive more funds than the channel has capacity for I cannot without doing on-chain transactions.
The amount of value tied up in that channel simply to maintain capacity is wasted.
A better system would reallocate funds based on who was using what at any given time like a bank does it.
Maybe I'm failing to understand how the value in these channels can be fully utilized at all times without requiring channel open close request to rebalance their size.
If there is a clear explanation for this, I haven't read it.
I would love to write a LN simulator to better understand the network traffic topology of this, but I don't have the time now.
To me it still seems an insane amount of capital has to be tied up and inefficiently allocated for the large value use case.

So, the technical community does include Garzik and others. However, they represent a small minority of the technical community and are no longer actively involved in maintaining the code.

Only hard-forks.  Soft-forks do not create a new chain.  They are, by definition, fully backwards compatible.
Some would disagree with me and argue that a 'non-contentious' hard fork with 100% support that kills the original chain would 'be the same token'.  However, after recent events, I'm not sure there is any such thing as a 'non-contentious' hard-fork and there will never be 100% consensus for anything.
The good news is now that segwit is activated, we can do an awful lot of interesting stuff as a soft-fork going forward.


Soft forks extend the consensus rules, they don't change them.  It's a subtle but important distinction.  You can tell the difference because a soft-fork does not cause a chain split.  Also, any features of a soft-fork are *optional* and not required for users to support.  All of their old wallets and transactions are still valid and they can still use the features they used previously.

When a fork coin comes out, sell it and get more bitcoin.
I got 12 extra bitcoin from the bitcoin cash fork, from people so stupid they would give good money for that shit.
No one wants S2X coin. Anyone stupid enough to pay good money for it will get completely reckt and we just get more real bitcoin.
The *only* purpose S2X has is to 'fire the core devs'. As soon as it becomes apparent that isn't going to happen, that fork quite literally has no reason to exist.
Miners will not mine a worthless token.
This whole S2X thing was a scam. They seriously, honestly, expected exchanges to just list it as BTC.
As soon as it becomes fully apparent that isn't going to happen, and that no sane exchange will list it without strong replay protection, it will fold.

For the 'market to decide' there has to be a clear market for the two separate tokens and for that to happen requires strong replay protection. 
If S2X had strong replay protection I don't think anyone here would have such a big issue with it.
The lack of replay protection means that is a direct attack on the existing bitcoin network with the intention of not 'competing fairly in the marketplace' but rather by using a 51% hashpower attack on the incumbent chain with the stated intention of destroying it.
For a 'free market' to happen, you need to be able to trade the two tokens without disruption, without strong-replay protection that is not so easily done.

Were that extreme case to occur, then yes, that would be a problem.
However, you are making the assumption that the market will follow hashrate, rather than the other way around.
I don't think the S2X coin is going to be worth all that much.  So explain to me why 99% of the miners are going to mine a worthless fork-coin for years on end to kill the other chain?
Were this to happen, then bitcoin would fork with a new proof-of-work, essentially firing the miners, and the community which supports the current core-devs, consensus rules, and roadmap, would move with it.  It would be messy.  It is certainly not an ideal outcome, but the point is that it would not be the death of the version of bitcoin that the vast majority of the community currently supports.
I still don't see how miners are going to mine a worthless fork-coin for years at a 99% level.
When one bitcoin is worth $4,000 and one S2X coin is worth $40, you really think 99% of miners are going to keep mining that shit-coin?
Nobody wants S2X.  It solves absolutely nothing.  The only thing it accomplishes is increasing the blocksize limit (something bitcoin cash *already does*) and 'getting rid of the core' devs; which is absurd since 99.9999999% of the segwit 2X code was written by the core-devs.  Contrary to popular belief, the vast majority of bitcoin owners don't want to 'fire core'.  They place their confidence in that development team and show that confidence by holding their bitcoin through all of these attacks. 
If 25% of the community wants to 'fire the core devs' and hard-fork, **that already happened** with bitcoin-cash.  So go use it.  The rest of us value the current chain, the current consensus rules, the current devs, and the current roadmap.  We will stick with BTC, thank you very much.
If miners insist on mining S2X, even at a massive loss, simply to 'kill BTC' what will happen is that the miners will get fired instead. Not my ideal outcome.  I don't think 99% of the miners are going to be that stupid to mine at a loss for days, months, weeks, or years.

I compare bitcoin to gold because it was intentionally designed to mimic the properties of that store of value.  Gold has a 7 trillion dollar market cap.  I figure bitcoin will easily be worth 5-10% of gold in the coming years, simply because it is dramatically more useful than gold is (can't zap gold over the internet).
Bitcoin's primary use case is as a store of value like gold, not a payment network like VISA.

You talk about 2 years of frustration without acknowledging that the major guilty party was a mining cartel trying to block upgrades because they had a hacked SHA256 implementation that gave them an advantage.
They blocked protocol upgrades to protect their hack and created much of the community drama and split with propaganda.

Dear *"anyone who will fucking listen to me"*, Ver is promoting an alt-coin that has already cost investors massive amounts of money.  He has a terrible track record on these things.  He has previously pumped numerous other alt-coins and only recently was pimping the S2X hard-fork as 'the real bitcoin'.
BCH is not 'the real bitcoin'.  The 'real bitcoin' is the continuous non-broken chain that lists on exchanges under the BTC symbol and currently commands a market price of around $5,600 each.
If you continue to follow Roger Ver's investing advice it will end in tears for you, all the while Roger continues to be worth literally hundreds of millions of dollars.

Miners role is to validate blocks for money.  Jihan Wu created a hacked version of SHA256 which does not actually do a full SHA256.  Then he spent the past two years using every dirty trick in the book to get the community to capitulate to his demands.
Enough is enough.  You can design any ASIC miner you want, just so long as it does a **full** SHA256 against any random input data.  That is the textbook definition of a hash.
Enough with miners trying to control anything regarding the protocol.  This is literally as if the janitors at my tech company were demanding to control how I write my code for self-driving cars.
Miners perform a service for a fee; period.

Yeah, so when litecoin is being used so much that it has consistently full blocks and those problems, let's talk.  Meanwhile it's available transaction capacity today for low value payments, if only Coinbase and BitPay and other payment processors would support it.
Of course, not just Litecoin is suitable for that, many alts as well, but LTC has the longest history and shares the code and design philosophy of BTC so I think it's a good fit.

I agree. They have &gt;51% hashpower lined up to mine at a loss long enough to declare S2X the winner and rebrand the token.

Because BTC does not have an EDA the original chain could die.

It has a much higher transaction capacity than bitcoin. Plenty to handle a lot of payment transactions now.

Yes, because I believe that bitmain will make that happen.
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:48:24
By your logic, if the US government bought a bunch of ASICs and got majority hashing power for their full AML/KYC compliant bitcoin software, we should all just shut the fuck up and do or say nothing about it because, well, they got majority hashing power.
Also, anyone who thinks miners will mine a worthless coin are delusional.
Hash-rate is not a persistent irreversible condition.  Miners will point their hashpower wherever they can make the most money.  They follow profit.  Why would they mine a coin no one wants, regardless of how many 'agreements' got signed or how many bits they signaled?
Finally, this a serious question.
Let's say that S2X launches.  And, on the first day, one S2X coin is worth a bunch more than a bitcoin, and miners mine it.
Then, a day later, a bunch of whales come in and crash the S2X price with massive sell orders.
Now the BTC chain is whole lot more profitable to mine, so miners rush to point their hashrate there.
Now, did S2X 'become bitcoin' on Monday, and then 'not become bitcoin' on Tuesday?  This is not some extreme example.  It could actually happen.
When you realize this you will see that it is not hashpower that defines a cryptocurrency, it is the consensus rules of the continuous blockchain.
After having watched our community go through this for a while now, I am now convinced completely that if at any point in the future even core created a hard-fork, that too would be a new token and would need replay protection and to be listed as a new symbol.
Now we see why core devs have been so resistant to hardforks for so long.  It's a clusterfuck situation.

Correct. This is exactly the reason why I believe the LN is only useful for the micro-transaction use case.  If you want to pay your rent, you do it on-chain.
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:16:44
Apparently the S2X crowd doesn't see it that way. They fully plan to fork on mining power alone even if 99% of non-mining full nodes do not. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:23:16
I hope you are right, but I think I have accurately captured the way 'they' look at it.
Coinbase, GBTC owners, etc. understand none of of this stuff.  Whatever is called 'bitcoin' in their 3rd party custodial wallet is bitcoin to them.
I honestly believe these companies who signed the NYA are counting on this.  Collectively, through custodial accounts, they control a massive percentage of the ecosystem and whatever they 'call bitcoin' is going to be bitcoin to their user base.
The fact that they refuse replay protection is proof positive of my thesis.  They know, 100%, that they plan to hijack the bitcoin brand and move it into a development fork that they wholly own and control.
I mean, this is all pretty clear and obvious at this point.  They get majority hashing power, they get control over the software, and they already control the vast majority of active bitcoin users since most of them are hosted by 3rd party accounts they control.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:23:39
I think most people care more about protecting and controlling their own wealth than making micro-transactions for small purchases.

If I said or implied it doesn't produce a valid hash, that isn't what I meant. I meant what you just said, for the optimization to work it needs the data in a particular format.
So, for this optimization to work means a miner is trying to influence the data format for bitcoin. And that is not how it works.
So, sorry their optimization doesn't work now that the format has changed. There was no reason for them to assume the format would never change.

That is wildlly unreasonable, if for no other reason than hashrate is transient. Hashpower could switch between two fork chains multiple times in a week.

The problem is it can be driven to be used entirely for black market activities; which is a long way from realizing it's full promise.
However, I don't think this is really going to happen.  The crypto-currency genie is out of the bottle and cannot be stuffed back in.  It also brings with it far too many efficiency improvements to go away.

In my personal opinion, the LN is only useful for microtransactions.  I do not think it works for larger amounts of value.  I can envision people opening up a LN channel for $100 or so, use it for micro-transactions, and probably never bother to close it.
The rest of the normal, higher value transactions, will occur, initially, on the main bitcoin network, but also on sidechains, or even alt-coins like litecoin using atomic swaps.

Erik. This isn't an abstract point. You actually have some strong influence in this supposed "free market" outcome.
So, will Shapeshift support S2X and BTC trading immediately?
If not, how come you aren't supporting the "free market".
Is it, perhaps, because S2X doesn't have strong replay protection, hell even soft replay protection, and you can't offer it as a fair trade because users would lose funds due to replay attacks?
Serious question. Is Shapeshift going to offer S2X to BTC trading and if so, how, and if not, why?

It probably doesn't exist in the LN API *yet*, but it's an incredibly standard thing to have what is called a pub/sub model in an API.  It's a generic way to register for events.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:52:25


Eric, are you just intentionally repeating this as 'reasonable' without recognizing the falsehood of the claim??
* Hashpower is **not** 'the market'
* Hashpower is fickle and can switch from chain to chain.  It is not a persistent irreversible state.
* *'The market'* is determined by the **price** of the token, not the amount of hashpower (though hashpower tends to follow the price *when acting rationally*).  That said, the market is fickle and it too can swing back and forth.
The only thing which is guaranteed to stay consistent is the blockchain **which does not fork**.  Hashpower can swing back and forth between two chains.  Price can swing back and forth between two chains.  They are not persistent irreversible states.
Would you have Shapeshift and Xapo redefine which one is the 'real bitcoin' on a daily, or weekly, basis as whales battle out for market dominance on exchanges!??
The only way to uniquely identify a token is by it's consensus rules leading to a continuous non-split chain.
Now, Eric, I know for a fact that you are not a stupid man.  So I can only assume that you are ignoring these facts because they don't fit your narrative.

This is nonsense. It is an independent chain with different consensus rules incompatible with the current chain. It *will* result in two chains. The current chain is called BTC. The new chain will have a new exchange symbol.
Miners will mine the more profitable chain.
Currently BTC has a market price of about $4,300. The S2X token, which does not yet exist, has no market value.
I'm rather skeptical that miners are going to mine a token with no value.
If the original chain has a higher market value, it will get majority hashpower.
It is not impossible that during market uncertainty and turmoil that majority hashpower will cycle between the two chains.

A LN node is essentially a hot wallet. If people get a virus on their machine, or some other malicious software, it could cause their node to send money to the attacker and then close the channel.
Also, hackers can wreak havoc on the network flooding it with invalid channel close requests which do not result in a 'refund' but rather a loss of funds.
Flooding the network with cascading channel close requests could create chaos.
Attack vectors are not just whether or not someone can steal funds but also how malicious and disruptive they can be as well.

My suggestion is really just have a 'sweep all funds' one click button is all.  The warning message also can throw you off.  And the fact that you enter the funds and it tells you that you don't have enough (because of the miners fee) these are all things that happened to me the first time I tried and I found it a bit confusing.  I was also trying to demonstrate to my wife 'how easy it is' and that demonstration turned out to be a bit of a fail for these reasons.

@_date: 2015-04-15 23:12:58
Like I said, the feature is useful, but it is also a bit confusing and complicated if you just want to sweep the funds.  For example, when you create the send transaction it then pops up a warning saying you are sending the funds to your 'own wallet' which, is of course, exactly what anyone would want to do, but the pop-up warning makes you freak out and think you are doing something wrong.

I agree with you that if it wins in the marketplace then it wins in the marketplace. But it won't be called BTC on exchanges.
My question is why not compete in the free market by enabling replay protection and protecting users funds?
What exchange symbol will SegWit2X trade on shapeshift?
Because if you trade it as BTC and lose people's funds there are going to be problems.
What is one SegWit2X coin worth right now?
I know that one BTC is worth about $4,300.
Now, tell me, why would anyone mine S2X unless it is worth something?
Have you done price discovery on S2X coin? Is there even a futures market?
It doesn't matter how many miners signal something, they aren't going to mine a worthless coin.
Moreover, you assume that 'majority hash power' is some persistent and permanent state.
If the price of S2X cycles dramatically against BTC you could easily see majority hashpower swing back and forth.
Are you going to call S2X bitcoin on Monday and the current chain bitcoin on Friday while the market does price discovery and miners move their hashpower to follow?
I get that you are super confident that S2X is going to win.
Good for you. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. Let the free market decide.
But if you try to list S2X as BTC on your exchange, or if you lose people's funds because of lack of replay protection, be prepared for the consequences.
You act like you have already won this battle when it hasn't even begun.
Miners will mine the most profitable chain. They don't decide how much a token is worth. The free market decides and I am very skeptical the market is going to choose the S2X coin. It could also modulate dramatically between the two chains for an extended period of time.
Why you want to intentionally create this market disruption is a mystery to me. I know you have a shit ton more money at stake than I do. Why you want to risk it all in a reckless game like this is beyond me.
I am confident the free market will chose the best token and the hashpower will follow the value, as it always does.

This is true.  But signalling helps.  We build consensus organically from the collective will of many stakeholders.  Having stakeholders more strongly signal their true intentions has real value.
If we make it clear enough that hashpower support, or at least overwhelming hashpower support, does not exist for S2X it may prevent it from launching entirely.

Why can't the bitcoin core node temporarily block any peer which forwards an invalid block? Thinking something like, if a peer forwards an invalid block they are immediately disconnected and that IP address is put in a exclusion list for say 15-30 minutes. After that a peer from that same IP address could reconnect.
Wouldn't this rapidly cull the bad nodes?
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:00:45
Coinbase said that the current chain will be called BTC.  Last I checked, it's worth nearly $6,000 and nobody wants S2X.  Thus the cheering.

The project isn't fucking 'led by developers'. If that were true we would have had segwit activated two years ago!
Developers make **proposals** that get discussed and the community either rejects or accepts.
But you sure as hell need competent developers and that, S2X does **not** have.
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:02:25
That's a fair point.  I'm not sure what I could contribute to bitcoin source.  I would if I thought I had something valuable to offer.  My background is in video games and I do not have a deep knowledge of crytpography.  I could certainly contribute in terms of general code cleanup or possibly working on the wallet software though.  
One thing I would like to do is continue doing blockchain analysis.  I would also like to work on some network simulators.  I think there is a strong need for us to have better network modeling tools to simulate various scenarios so we can have some real experimental data to base our design decisions on.

If there is a Segwit2X hard fork which gains maximum hashing power, and if there is anything left of the old chain, that's probably what they will call it.  Because the exchanges, Coinbase, BitPay, etc. will all start calling S2X 'bitcoin'. 
This is what we are facing if this madness doesn't get reversed.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:58:44
At least it wasn't an effort by corporations I guess that is something. But, yeah, there are a lot of stakeholders.
At the end of the day if they want to create a corporate bitcoin, I believe they can. I don't think it is a good idea, but they can. Doing so without replay protection is, IMO, criminal fraud.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:57:44
Don't you feel that the BCH hard fork, which is a weak attack on bitcoin by trying to steal the user base and confuse the brand identity, kind of negates any NY agreement?
There already exists one big block hard fork, I cannot fathom why we need yet another now.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:43:09


Provably vested parties include the developers and the investors.  They were both excluded from this hostile hard fork attack.
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:27:38
You have it so fucking backwards it's absurd.  Miners will point their hash-rate at the token that is worth the most money.  Not the other way around.  Miners follow the money.  Users follow the token which they support.
I could fucking care less which token 'has the most hash-power' on a daily basis.
For example, I have no fucking clue how much hashing power ethereum has (though I hear it's a lot).  Do I buy ethereum because it's got a shit ton of hashing power?  No.  I would buy ethereum if I supported their technology, roadmap, and development team (which I do not).
You will be amazed when you find out how few people actually want the S2X coin.

At over $4,000 we have been mainstream for a while.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:42:52
What brings it home to me is this.
You know how we always say "don't invest more than you are willing to lose"? For each person that is a different number but, for me, that amount was $15,000.
So, in 2013 I bought 150 bitcoin for $15,000 and got on this ride. Since then I have bought more, sold some at a profit, and bought more again, but I still have about that many.
What gets me is that the same $15,000 investment today wouldn't buy even 3 bitcoin.
It's pretty wild to think about.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:57:43

You are making a big assumption that there would need to be any identifying information in the pub/sub model.  I see no reason why that would be required.

So, it takes a day or two from the time I convert my current investments to cash so that I'm ready to pull the trigger on a fresh buy order.  It's now been two weeks since I did this, and I'm getting tired of waiting.  I'm about ready to move my money back into another investment but...I don't want to miss the launch window (assuming it represents an opportunity).
My question is simple, will we get advance warning before the symbol goes live and, if so, how much warning? 
Also, I have no interest in buying GBTC or any bitcoin backed security at above market prices.  That makes no sense to me at all.
I've got IRA money burning a hole in my Etrade account ready to move into something backed by bitcoin but that doesn't seem like it is happening any time soon.

This is a lousy analogy. You would do both. Spin up extra servers as a short term fix for customers while, at the same time, working your ass off to fix the code.

Here is something to help put it in perspective.
How much money do you have at stake in bitcoin?
Whatever it is, you are still a minnow.
People and corporations literally have tens of billions of dollars worth of value at stake.
You really think they want to bring the whole thing down?
Yes, there will probably be some major market volatility, but too much money is at stake for people to commit financial suicide over this.
At least that is how I try to put it in perspective.

Imagine thousands of banks worldwide each operating their own miners. You aren't allowed to be on the network unless you have a valid digital signature issued by a consortium/governing body. This prevents just anyone from joining the network.
Over 51% of all of the machines would have to be hacked for the network to be threatened. If someone goes rouge their certificate is revoked and they are no longer are allowed to participate in the network.

The current banking system still takes days to move money from  one account to another.  So, obviously, bitcoin is superior to whatever the hell they are using now.

I agree with everything you just said. I was merely stating that the time that fees need to compensate for mining rewards is much sooner than the popular narrative.

This is serious guys. Coinbase, Gemini, and the GBTC fund, have no intention of honoring the current bitcoin chain!!
They intend to claim the chain with the most hashing power is 'by definition' bitcoin.
But, as we have seen, hashpower changes all of the time. It usually follows the money and, right now, only the current chain with the current rules, commands a $4,300 price.
The S2X chain would, and should, have no market value initially.
If these companies get away with this they will be stealing your bitcoin and replacing it with something you did not agree to!
It is already clear that the economic majority supports the current chain and consensus rules.
If they swap out your bitcoin for the new chain, you have just been **robbed**!
If they attempt to list S2X as BTC they will be committing fraud!
The current chain will live, and win, so long as exchanges list it honestly!  
Demand that all exchanges list S2X separately and make it clear, as we are already doing by running full nodes, that if they mine S2X we will not value it and will dump it. Hard.
If these companies list S2X as BTC that is fraud and I expect many large holders to file suit.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:24:31

Uh, dude, I don't know if you heard but S2X is DOA.  The lead (pretty much only dev) quit to start an ICO shitcoin, and no exchange will list it as BTC.  And rational miners will not point hashpower at a shit-coin worth 1/20th the price of the real thing.

Ripple maintains a cryptographically secured universal ledger.  That sounds close enough to a blockchain to me.

In all of my posts I have made it clear that I think bitcoin is vastly superior to any kind of fiat backed cryptocurrency.
So, that neither makes me a troll or a shill.
However, that this sub fails to understand, or refuses to understand, that the exact same technology underpinning bitcoin can be used by other people for different use cases is a bit hard to understand.

I have already made hundreds of thousands of dollars off of bitcoin. The bitcoin I have remaining effectively cost me nothing. That makes it easier for me to just hold. Even if it all goes to zero I can honestly say I made a lot of money off of bitcoin.
It's important to realize that even in a corporate takeover scenario bitcoin can still be worth a lot of money because, even highly regulated, the currency still has some important properties of scarcity.
Also, the uncensored fork will still survive.
So while it may be bearish for freedom it may not necessarily be bearish for price.

Yes.  I didn't say it was something you, or I, or any other bitcoiner would want to be involved in.  However, 99.999% of the world's money is already entrusted to banks, so it's not much of a leap for your average lemming to still entrust them.  In fact, the reality is, that most of the general public would trust 'fedcoin' over bitcoin; which they already associate with criminal activity and hackers.

As long as we have a mycelium thread, I would like to hijack it to post a question/feature request.  I was showing someone 'how easy' it is to sweep a BIP38 private key with Mycelium but it turned out it wasn't that easy after all.
I was expecting it to just sweep the funds but instead, after you scan the QR code and enter the BIP38 password, you have to initiate a spend transaction and compute the amount less miner fee and select your own destination which will then give you a warning message.  All combined a bit confusing.
I can see the value in this, it is actually very cool if you just wanted to pull some of the funds off of the cold-storage.  
However...it wasn't what I was expecting.  I would like to suggest that after you finish decoding the key why not have the user interface provide two options 'Sweep all funds' or 'Create a spend transaction'?
Since most of the time people are just going to want to sweep all of the funds to their wallet, that would be most convenient.

You are assuming the existing BTC chain will be unusable.  That is not true at all.  It may be slow, not unusable.  Which is just one of many reasons that significant time is required for markets to make a determination.
Also, many big traders will keep large positions on exchanges because, well, they like to make money.  And they will be trading furiously; all of which is entirely off-chain.

I'm quite familiar with it.  I also signed the John Ratcliff agreement.  You are under obligation to it, did you know? In the John Ratcliff agreement all forks of bitcoin must have rock-solid replay protection.  Me, and some of my friends, signed it and now you are all obligated to follow it, because, you know, it's an agreement.
Look, I didn't sign some NYA.  The development community didn't sign it.  An agreement without support of the actual owners of bitcoin, or the technical community which creates and maintains the software, is absolutely meaningless.
It's as if the janitors at my tech company all got together and signed an agreement about how I should develop software for a self-driving car.  God bless these guys, they do a good job, they take out the trash and keep the area clean, we really need them, but they do not have the power to sign any agreement on my behalf controlling my software.

Here is my personal take on it.  I donated $25 to Rand Paul even though I think he has zero chance of being nominated, much less elected.  I also disagree with him vehemently on a number of his views and statements.
So, you might ask then, why did I contribute?  I did because I think he is one of the few candidates who is actually raising issues that I care about.
If Rand Paul were not running we would hear virtually nothing from the other candidates on the topic of the surveillance state or the pathetic drug war.
The other candidates just want to politely ignore these issues entirely.  So, I gave Rand Paul $25 so he can keep running his mouth off.

I didn't ignore any 'point' you made.  I answered all of them.  
Regarding soft-forks, do you object to pay-2-script transactions? Do you object to multi-sig? 
Look, your transactions are processed by the network whether you choose to use segwit or not.  That's just how it works.
If you truly hate segwit so much that you want to operate on a chain which doesn't even have it at all, there are a number of other networks for you to choose from.  Bitcoin cash was specifically designed with that goal in mind. Maybe you should go use that fork?

The bitcoin network will soon no longer be constrained by the current on-chain system. When you add additional layers, these layers extend and encompass the network as a whole.
Yes, we want to limit the blocksize for the main chain while also enabling additional layers not limited by it. Not just payment channel networks like lightning but also things like mimblewimble or even DAGs which are two way pegged to the base token value.
In time the primary role of the layer-1 network will be to issue and secure the currency across all additional network layers.
This is how bitcoin will scale exponentially to serve everyone in the world.
Onchain scaling for exponential usage simply does not work. This isn't how you scale any network.

That has not been the public position of pretty much any exchange.  They would face serious legal jeopardy if they tried to do that.
Hash-rate is not a permanent state.  It flows from crypto-to-crypto based on market value. 
By your reasoning if the majority hashrate moves between two forks of bitcoin they swap the exchange symbol?  I don't think so.
Consensus rules on a continuous non-broken (non-forked) chain, define a crypto.  When you fork, you create a new token.

So, I can see a scenario like this.
You have a LN mobile wallet.  Your cell phone is online virtually all of the time anyway, so I'm not sure why you couldn't receive funds automatically.
If you are disconnected and a person wants to send you money,  their send transaction is put into a 'pending to be sent' queue.  When your cell phone is back on the Internet, it could send a signal (this is all done automatically by the wallet software) indicating it is ready to receive.  The transaction is then signed and all is fine.
If someone wants to send you money while you are offline, so long as you **automatically** receive the money the next time you are online, I really don't see the issue here.

What about miners who are literally facing execution from the Chinese government?  How about those guys?  You think mining for profit is going to be the deal breaker for them?
By far the majority hash power of the entire world resides in a single nation which, quite literally, has rolling execution vans.
This is not hyperbole.
If the government of China wants to take control of bitcoin via majority hash rate, they can compel those miners through a combination of physical threats of violence as well as potential long term rewards if their take-over succeeds.
Yes, they will mine at a loss if the government compels them to do so.
Miners will mine at a significant loss if they believe their ultimate reward is control of a network that will potentially be worth trillions of dollars.
You and I may think 'only the true bitcoin' will survive, but they simply do not see it that way.  This is a corporate and government take-over attempt of the network!

Have you ever heard of 'garbage collection' as it relates to computer science?
It's a similar problem.
For example, I can have a computer with a gigabyte of memory.  However, if I do enough memory allocations, eventually, I will be unable to allocate memory *even though there is plenty of memory available* due to fragmentation and the inability to find contiguous blocks available.
Here is a Wik page discussing the problem of fragmentation due to resource allocation issues (think needing to 'defragment your hard drive'):
Channel balancing in LN is very similar to the problem of garbage collection in memory allocators.
In the lightning-network, to perform 'garbage collection' would require that channels be closed and re-opened to 'rebalance' them.  This will create a lot of on-chain transaction pressure.
During the period of time while channels remain unbalanced there is potentially an enormous amount of value locked up and inaccessible, just like in a fragmented memory heap.
If the LN allowed value to freely flow across connections, this wouldn't be a problem, because value could flow smoothly between nodes.  However, since a certain amount of value has to be pre-allocated, you end up having extreme unbalanced situations.  Value tied up in unbalanced channels which cannot be accessed or the inability to transfer large amounts of value due to limited connectivity.
For the low value use case, this is still true, but the aggregate amount of value may be manageable.  However, if you wanted to support the ability for anyone on the network to be able to send or receive large amounts of value, then it would require literally orders of magnitude of value to be pre-assigned to make that happen.
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:47:36
Probably not.  It should though.
I think the main issue here is going to be legal.  Exchanges have some very strong obligations to protect people's money.  S2X, without replay protection, represents a dangerous risk to customer funds.
Frankly, I don't see how any exchange can list that fork-coin without replay protection in it.  They would get sued into oblivion.
You can argue 'max hashpower' is the 'real bitcoin' all you want, but I'm afraid that won't hold up in a court of law.  Virtually all expert witnesses will rightly claim that a token is determined by the consensus rules on a continuous chain, not some transient hashpower which changes allegiance hourly based on market forces.

It doesn't have any 'intrinsic value'.  Just like all of those little sheets of paper you put in your wallet.
Let me explain.
I'm going to give you a sheet of paper and on this sheet of paper is written in ink the number '100'.
Now, I'm going to give you another sheet of paper, and on this one, written in ink, is the number '1'.
Now, if you go into a dollar store, they will give you 100 items for one sheet of paper and only one item for the other.
In both cases they are just sheets of paper with ink on them.  The only difference is that one sheet of paper has ink smooshed on top of it forming  a symbol that people call '100' and on the other the ink forms a different shape.
There is no intrinsic value.  The 'value' is assigned through a collective form of group hypnosis.  Collectively a group of people ascribe value to these sheets of paper based on a wide variety of reasons, one of which is it's presumed 'scarcity'.
Bitcoin has value for the same exact reasons.  It is scarce, immutable, and used by a community as a way to represent and exchange value.
Unlike the USD, bitcoins, however, are extremely, extremely, rare and impossible for forge.  While the US Government prints up new sheets of paper and (mostly) just issues digital versions of their token at will, making it increasingly less rare (thus eroding it's value through inflation), bitcoin has a very clear and obvious fixed issuance schedule governed by math and enforced by the rules of the software run by the collective owners of this currency in the form of 'full nodes'.
The utility of bitcoin is, quite obviously, vastly superior to that of the USD, and all government issued currencies for that matter.
Over time, as more people realize just how vastly superior bitcoin is, it's 'value' will continue to increase until it reaches a certain equilibrium state; which is probably decades into the future.
One thing to note.  Is that bitcoin arguably does have some intrinsic value in the sense that work had to be expended to produce it.  Work has to be expended to produce a dollar bill too.  I mean, there's printing presses, paper, ink, etc. all of which cost money.  However, it doesn't really cost 'more work' to produce a $100 than a $1 (other than maybe some very marginal deviations).  Of course, most USD is created out of thin air on a computer, where the work expended to produce it is effectively zero.
However, bitcoin is different.  Each bitcoin, right now, is worth about $4,300.  This means that typically $4,300 worth of electricity was consumed performing the work necessary to issue each and every bitcoin today.  In this way, bitcoin is a bit more like gold, which actually requires a miner to perform work to dig it out of the ground.  So, it has that over government fiat.

@_date: 2017-10-03 21:08:02


That makes zero sense.  What do you mean by the 'minority' chain?  You do realize that hashrate is not a persistent condition right?  Hashrate changes based on market value.
At this time I see zero reason to think that one S2X coin will be worth even a tiny fraction of BTC.  Probably well less than the 0.1 level BCH tries to maintain.
Now, explain to me why miners are going to mine S2X coin if it's worth only 1/10th the price of BTC?
What miners 'signal' means nothing.  When the fork occurs, and a new token is created, and if it has replay protection, and if it is listed on exchanges, then it will garner a market value.  Miners will point their hashing power at the chain which is worth the most.
Not the other way around.  
Anyone who owns any BTC and leaves it on an exchange has a complete and full expectation that their BTC represents the chain, and consensus rules, that they bought it on.  If the exchange wants to give that customer an equal amount of replay-safe S2X coin, that is absolutely fine.
Your assumption that S2X coin will be worth mining is not warranted.   Currently the S2X coin has no known market value.  What I do know is that the S2X has no support from the technical community and people who hold BTC prefer it over S2X above 75%.
How you think that translates to a higher market price, because of what some miners signal or not, doesn't mean shit.  People who run full nodes are almost entirely rejecting S2X.  That should give you some indication of how much 'support' this fork-coin has.
@_date: 2015-09-05 05:53:07
You do realize that only a few million people can hold value on the bitcoin network, right? So those billions of people transacting on sidechains, how are they ever supposed to hold any value on the main blockchain?
Bitcoin doesn't need to scale for more cups of coffee, it needs to scale to accommodate more people.
For these billions of people transacting on sidechains, what value are they transacting with? It certainly can't be backed by bitcoin, because bitcoin cannot hold value for more than a few million people.

Why cannot a decentralized authority blockchain that anyone can verify which copy is legitimate, without consulting a 3rd party, exist but it exists on a network which restricts who is allowed to mine blocks?
For example, I run a full node of the bitcoin blockchain.  My node is independently verifying the blockchain *but* it cannot function as a miner.

The EDA is destroying BCH.
Bitcoin was designed to have an exponentially decreasing block-reward subsidy.
Also, by design, is that fees are supposed to make up ever more and more of the miners reward to offset the decreasing block-reward.
But...BCH has no fees.  It has no transactions.  And it will never have much in the way of fees, because it has giant blocks and the creators of BCH think fees are evil.
So, without any revenue from fees for miners, BCH will die.
At some point, people need to realize that high fees on BTC is a **major feature not a bug**!
Once we have LN and atomic swaps, people will be able to do low-fee transactions on additional layers.  This is the plan.  This is the design. And it is proceeding nicely.

I do not believe that a blockchain *requires* currency to be issued.  The currency issuance of bitcoin is designed to incentivize miners.  However, an alternate blockchain could have a completely different reward system, especially if miners were restricted to approved participants.
In other words I'm talking about an open ledger that anyone can verify but only a restricted group is allowed to 'mine'.  That group being banks.  And, why would they do this?  So they could charge lots of fees, which is what banks like to do.
To say the only way to run a blockchain is by issuing currency is simply not true.  You could easily design one which is entirely fee based which, btw, is what is supposed to happen to bitcoin in the future.

Unfortunately, none of this makes sense unless they have an off-chain solution. The bitcoin network can only handle about six million transactions a month. If hundreds of millions, or billions, of devices want to use bitcoin it will all have to happen off-chain.
That said, I don't have a big problem with any company offering off-chain products for micro-transactions. I don't see how letting an off-chain centralized company access pennies worth of value is a real concern.
Frankly, I don't know what they are doing but if it leads to a bitcoin backed value transfer network embedded in hundreds of millions of devices, sign me up.

I'm saying that a valid hash function does not care what the input data looks like.  ASICBOOST, apparently, cares what the input data looks like or it breaks their 'optimization'.  If they require the input data to be in a specific format, then it is not really a full SHA256 implementation.  A hash function, by definition, works with *arbitrary* input data.

Can someone explain this to me?
I'm willing to accept that the bitcoin network may need to transform into a purely settlement network, and small day to day transactions pushed onto side-chains.  
That puts me firmly in agreement with what Szabo is saying here.
However, here are the things I don't understand.
* No decentralized off-chain solutions currently exist.  The only example he gives is 'ChangeTip' which is a centralized off-chain solution.  I don't have a problem, personally, with ChangeTip because it is designed purely for very small transactions.  However, they do know your identity, and those transactions are tracked.    I also access the bitcoin network to deposit or withdraw any meaningful value.  I wouldn't trust ChangeTip with more than a few dollars worth of value.
* If he is proposing that all bitcoin transactions should happen off-chain, then aren't we back to where we started?  We would become subject to centralized risk and loss of financial privacy.  While governments and banks might like that, I'm pretty sure most bitcoin enthusiasts do not.
* If there is supposed to be some kind of decentralized off-chain solution (which as far as I know does not yet exist) isn't it supposed to be pegged to value on the main blockchain?  Meaning, even if you do the vast majority of your day to day transactions off-chain, you must still be able to perform a few transactions a month to hold any value to be 'pegged', right?  With the current blocksize limit, only about 6 million people can perform one transaction on the main blockchain (i.e. hold any value) a month.  How does Szabo, or other off-chain supporters, propose to solve this problem?  How do we support a larger number of people being able to hold/peg value on the main blockchain without raising the blocksize?  Is the proposal to remove the ability for individuals to hold value on blockchain itself and have them hold some alternate value on the side-chain?  I have never had this adequately explained to me.
* Even if a decentralized off-chain solution existed (which it does not) it will only be useful when it is integrated into the entire existing bitcoin infrastructure (wallets, exchanges, payment providers) etc.  How long until I can send or receive bitcoin with my cell-phone wallet and have it occur seamlessly on a side chain so I don't even know it is happening?  When?  Years?  Never?
TLDR: Even if you support off-chain solutions and bitcoin as a settlement only network, how are we going to accommodate more users?  Does Szabo, and theymos, and Back, all propose that only banks and centralized institutions be allowed to 'settle' directly on the blockchain?  Do they believe the general public should be able to hold value on the core bitcoin network and, if so, how with the current blocksize limit?

@_date: 2015-09-05 05:47:27
Can you explain to me how people can transact value on sidechains without also holding value on the blockchain? After all, only a few million people can peg value on the blockchain.
What this means is that even if an off-chain solution could handle billions of transactions, it would have to be billions of transactions for just a few million people since only that many can hold value on the main blockchain.

He has 'proven' it because Satoshi made it extremely clear from his initial white-paper that he meant bitcoin to be a peer-to-peer cash system.  He also stated, publicly, that growing the blocksize would be no big deal in the future.

I'm going assume you are serious, so here are the serious answers but, really, it all boils down to two words.  "Good riddance".


No.  Not sure what that question even means.  Do you mean will the value of bitcoin collapse because of this?  The answer is no.








You need to understand.  The 'Bitcoin Foundation' was a self-appointed public relations group promoting bitcoin.  
There is already plenty of interest to support funding for core developers.  Funding core developers was, arguably, about the only thing useful the Bitcoin Foundation ever did, but, we hardly need them for that.  In fact, we can do a much better job of it ourselves.
Let me reiterate. The 'Bitcoin Foundation' was a public relations front.  They didn't do a very good job.  They had relatively little influence in terms of lobbying governments and they did a horrific job communicating during things like the MtGox fiasco.  They also lacked transparency.
We are much better off without them.  That is not to say that Bitcoin couldn't benefit from better lobbying, education, and public relations.  We just don't need this front group to accomplish that.
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:01:49
It's not an argument.  Did you see what I wrote?  I think bitcoin is vastly superior for exactly these reasons.  To banks, being able to freeze funds and do full KYC/AML is a feature, not a bug.  
Nowhere in my post did I suggest such a system would be in any way superior to bitcoin.  I was simply arguing that banks could use the technology if they choose to do so.

They are doing the work.  They produce a valid hash.  It's that they are not hashing arbitrary input data; which is the textbook definition of a hash.  Their 'optimization' is based on making assumptions as to to the format of the input data.  If you make assumptions about the format of the input data, you are no longer performing an arbitrary hash.
This is why, when the software makes changes to the input data, it 'breaks their optimization'.  However, were they doing a full proper hash to begin with, they wouldn't, and shouldn't care.
Show me anywhere in any whitepaper or anything else that said that miners can make hard-coded assumptions about the format of the input data to the bitcoin SHA256?
It doesn't exist.  The format of the input data can, and does, change when the software is revised.

You are assuming that the market *gets* to decide.  For the market to decide, exchanges need to do a whole bunch of shit.  Like not list S2X coin as BTC.  Like require S2X coin to have strong replay protection.

I invested in GBTC for a couple of years.  For most of that time it traded at about a 20-30% price premium.  Which was a problem for me; but I justified it as being 'worth it' because of the ability to hold BTC (kind of) in my 401k.
However, it became irrational earlier this year and started trading at a 100%+ price premium and is largely disconnected from the price of bitcoin.
Also, earlier this year when people thought the COIN ETF might be approved, the GBTC price premium went to *zero* almost overnight.
Anyone who buys and holds GBTC today is still at risk of watching the price premium disappear in an instant, without any ability to get out of your position, if any competing product is launched or even rumored to be launched.
Meanwhile, I can just buy more BTC and hold it for long term capital gains with my after-tax money.
If you want to risk having your GBTC drop in price without warning because the premium simply vanishes in an instant, more power to you.  But you wanted to know why I think it is 'horrible' and that is why.

Reformatting your list of bitcoin traitors to make it a bit easier to read:
* Roger Ver

* Barry Silbert
* Vinny Lingham
* Brian Armstrong

* Larry Summers
* Blythe Masters
* Bruce Wagner
* Brock Pierce 
* Jiang Zhuoer.
*The following are not involved in S2X directly but are no friends of bitcoin*
* Mark Karpeles
* Tim Swanson
* Jamie Dimon
All of these people were once (past tense) great supporters of bitcoin (excluding Jamie Dimon and Tim Swanson who have always been anti-bitcoin).  Many of them are now actively betraying the community and what we are trying to create by pushing this unwanted hostile hard-fork attack on the bitcoin network.  It **is** contentious.  It has virtually zero support from the development community.  It does not have support from the end users and the futures market price reflects that.
It is definitively **'hostile'** not only because it is contentious and lacks developer support but, most importantly, because it lacks proper replay protection.  This makes it inherently a 51% attack on the network trying to change the consensus rules (no different than any other attacker).
This hard-fork attempt will, hopefully, fail.  With the current futures price and the lack of general consensus, I don't really see, at this point, how it can succeed.  Nevertheless, all of these people, most of whom were once champions of the freedom that bitcoin represents, have now become traitors to our cause.
They will forever be remembered for what they are trying to do here today.  There is still time for them to call this reckless hard-fork off.  They could redeem themselves, but I'm afraid it is getting close to being too late for most of them.
Bitcoin is currently an 80 billion dollar financial network.  These supposed market and thought leaders are willing to put the entire thing at risk, including their personal fortunes and investments, by launching a reckless and contentious hard fork which will create market confusion, lead to loss of funds, create incredible volatility, leave a dark stain on both them and the public perception of bitcoin, and probably result in numerous lawsuits which could devastate their businesses if they continue on this path.

Bitcoin is already a success. Could it grow to be many times larger? Sure, it could. But it works perfectly fine as it is too.
If five years from now bitcoins are worth $230 and anyone around the world can still directly access the network, as they do today, then that is still a huge win in my book.

I am a huge proponent of bitcoin and I have made a significant personal investment in its future.   If that future means that only six million people can ever use the blockchain directly then I am very discouraged indeed.  If it means that the software itself is locked up under centralized control, a point of attack, and those controllers do not respect or honor the wishes of the actual users of the network, yeah, I have problems with that as well.

Bitcoin is the token listed on exchanges based on the current chain. Any new chain is a new token.
Proof of work follows value. If the hashrate cycles weekly between two chains, by your logic, bitcoin would flip flop weekly.
A token is defined by the chain it runs on, not some transient hash rate.

Because if bitcoin were to become 'successful'; meaning accounting for hundreds of millions of transactions on side-chains, then it is limited to only a few million people who could ever do settlement transactions.
The current blocksize limit doesn't just limit transaction capacity, it severely limits user capacity; it can handle roughly one transaction per month for a few million people at most.
If there are hundreds of millions of off-chain transactions, then the only people who can afford to do 'settlement' transactions are limited to banks and large institutions fighting it out for that settlement slot.  It's not that an individual couldn't perform a transaction on the main chain, but they might have to pay $20 or more to compete with banks and other centralized networks which are doing settlements to accommodate the 'poor folks' who could never get direct access to the network.
I'm surprised not everyone understands this; that the blocksize doesn't just several restrict the number of payment-style transactions, it also severely restricts the number of settlement transactions possible.

I have no problem with anyone creating a hard-fork under a new exchange symbol and trading it.  It's really no different than any other alt-coin.
My problem is when the hard-fork does not have strong replay protection because then it is an actual attack directly on the network with the intention of maximum disruption, potential loss of users funds, and with a clear and stated goal of killing the incumbent chain.
That is what is happening here, and if were being done by anyone other than some corporations, we would rightly refer to it as a 51% hostile take over attempt.  Which is exactly what this is.

Well, 1mb blocks support about 5 million people holding value on the blockchain (and that is super conservative, assuming they only do like one transaction a MONTH).  2mb supports 10 million people.  I think we will need to scale an order of magnitude higher than that.
Yet, really, this all may be a moot point.  This controversy is really hurting bitcoin and it may be what kills it as greater usage and adoption may stop.  I don't know why there cannot be reasonable informed debates on this stuff.  Meanwhile, we are dealing with censorship and DDOS attacks and all many of 'dirty tricks' and hidden agendas.  
So, great, in two to four years bitcoin will allow as many as 40 million people to perform one transaction a month.  I guess I should get excited about that, I guess....

The real problem of centralization is mining pools.  I don't think there is any solution to this problem, but this is what is causing the centralization risk.
If every single person on the planet could run a full-bitcoin node and receive a small amount of bitcoin reward in return many more would do so.  However, due to the combined hashing power of mining pools, running a full-node on a home computer would only earn about one one millionth of a penny a year I'm guessing.
Is there some way to decentralize mining pools?  I don't know, maybe greater use of p2pool type systems is the way to go.

Here's the problem. As things stand right now with the IRS your suggestion is bad financial advice. Every time you 'buy something' you incur a short term capital gain which is taxed at the highest rate.
Wait a year and it becomes long term capital gains and is taxed at a much lower rate.
So, until there is a change in the IRS ruling holding is the only good option.
People who have made killing on bitcoin and get pushed into the highest tax bracket could see more than a 50% tax hit on their profits.
That's the 39% federal tax rate, plus medicare, plus social security on part of the gains, and finally state taxes all of that can easily add up to almost 50 cents on the dollar.

So, I think my math is correct here.
Today a single bitcoin transaction pays a fee of about 4 cents.
Miners are earning about $900,000 a day.
So, for transaction fees to make up the difference and, *without transaction fees increasing*, the network would have to go from 100,000 transactions per day to 2.25 billion.
Seems unlikely to me....
What I think is far more likely is that, in the future, transactions on the bitcoin network will likely only be for very significant value and with substantially higher fees.
All of the day to day transactions (your cup of coffee, what have you) will have to move to side chains or some other off blockchain system.
I can imagine a future where the idea of using the bitcoin network to buy a cup of coffee will seem insane.
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:37:31
Well, let's look at where we are today.  The original intent of bitcoin was that all of the participants would also be miners.  We see how that turned out.  Today mining is incredibly centralized.  It might as well be just a handful of banks.  We have extreme centralization in bitcoin today.
Since POW work on a distributed network acts as a layer of security, I don't see why that network of participants being open, or closed, really matters that much.   
I don't see why the distinction between mining being open to everyone, or restricted to an approved set of people, is the make or break here.  
I imagine a scenario where someone hacks into a bank's computer or data center.  In a fully trusted system with no POW, the hacker could just steal some money, no problem.  With POW, the hacker would need to be able to execute a 51% attack to to overwhelm the system.
Banks get ripped off all of the time currently.  So why can't they use POW, even on a private network, as an extra layer of security?

Unfortunately, the math doesn't work for that.  LN is inherently an inefficient allocation of value due to channels always being unbalanced and the need to have channels large enough to accommodate the maximum value transfer / store at any given time.

@_date: 2015-09-08 22:10:35
Hmmm...ok.  So, why not support a short term increase to say 2mb blocks to give us breathing room since their tech won't exist for years?  I really believe the general public should be able to at least hold value on the blockchain.  I agree they don't need to use it to buy individual cups of coffee.  However, bitcoin has to scale substantially if it is ever expected to support more than a few million people holding any value at all.
So, you believe they support growing the blocksize to support more individual users, but not more transactions?  I hate having to be a mind-reader here, because I'm not getting clear message on any of this.
If off-chain solutions existed *today*, and were incorporated into the existing bitcoin infrastructure *today*, then I would be more more willing to accept their argument.  However, their technology doesn't exist, isn't proven, and won't exist for many years. It is also very unclear how it will all work in the end.   
In the meantime, if even one country decided to make greater use of bitcoin than they do today and, considering world crises as they are, that could happen at any moment, we are putting ourselves in a dangerous place.

My free advice, as someone who had a lot of money in GBTC until recently.
The depth of that order book is so shallow that I'm afraid you could be utterly fucked.  The moment an ETF is **announced** there will be a rush of people trying to sell their GBTC.  
Immediately you won't find any buyers until the premium completely vanishes (which is currently at 53%), so you will take a 53% hit right there.
However, I'm afraid it won't stop there.  I think people will quickly realize that GBTC itself is a failed piece of shit asset and not only will the premium disappear, it will start trading far *below* the supposed underlying asset value.  There is no way to convert GBTC to bitcoins.  GBTC has a very high service fee which rapidly erodes the underlying asset you hold.  The price doesn't track the actual market price of bitcoin.  It has no liquidity.  For all of these reasons I think no one is going to want to own a **single** share of GBTC the minute a viable ETF is available.
Look, you do whatever you want to do, but I got out and I'm not holding any until some stuff settles out (SegWit gets activated, hard fork threats go away, and an actual ETF is either approved or disapproved).
I've considered doing a self-directed IRA, but just decided to trade other stocks for a while instead.

Let's all be clear. Roger never intended bcash to be just another alt-coin to peacefully coexist with bitcoin.
It was fully his plan and intention that bcash destroy bitcoin by starving it of hashpower.
This isn't a conspiracy theory. Go back in the archives. It was the openly stated goal, and is still their highest aspiration today.
Just as Christians believe in the rapture, bcashers believe in a great prophecy called 'the flippening'.
The theory works like this.
They believe if they can pump up the price of bcash high enough that it is more profitable to mine than bitcoin, then miners will move to the more profitable chain. This will in turn cause the bitcoin network to slow down into a death spiral it can never recover from.
The repeated series of pump cycles, propaganda, combined with high fee spam attacks were all attempts at making this flippening happen.
They have attempted this a number of times and, at one point, managed to get bcash equal to 0.5 bitcoin for a hot minute.
They believe this 'flippening' prophecy with a religious zeal normally associated with crusades.
This is what is going on. It's not a conspiracy theory. It is their stated goal. Just read the forum posts from the time period of any previous pump cycle.

Well, to be fair, I'm not much of a mod.  I have never banned anyone, in fact I don't know if I even have that authority.  All I do is delete threads which are obvious spam.  And, for those who don't know, I mostly respond to reports, so if you see something that looks spammy or very non-bitcoin related, click the 'report' button and if I'm online I will usually delete it.
Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn't switch this to a news only site.  It would cut the trolling down by about 90% if we did that.  It would take away some of the fun of just casually posting about your bitcoin thoughts and experiences but, then again, that is where all of the troll shit comes from too.

Yes...the developers of the software have a lot of influence.  But it is the community which either accepts or rejects BIPs.

The explanation for a steadily dropping price does not require any conspiracy theories.
Bitcoin has constant sell pressure.  Constant.  And not nearly as much corresponding buy pressure.
Sell pressure comes from:
* New coins mined daily need to be sold.
* Anyone using the bitcoin network for commerce almost exclusively cashes out to fiat immediately; creating constant steady sell pressure.
* Thieves and hackers are stealing bitcoins all of the time.  They don't give a crap about price, or holding for long term, or that their actions affect price.  It's found money to them, all they want to do is cash it out as fast as they can for 'real' money.  This is probably one of the most significant factors.
* Day traders manipulating the market for fun and profit.
That's it.  That's all it takes.  And, until there is steady buy pressure from the general public, that's what we can expect to see.
There is every chance some big whales may splash in from time to time and we see the price rise (as happened on the GBTC announcement) but once that splash is over, it will continue the downward trend.
What would really save bitcoin is not big wall street types, it would be a billion people all trying to buy $20 worth.  That would be the ideal scenario.  But, I wouldn't hold my breath.

And, for the reasons you listed, 'fair value' is likely to be near zero.  Who wants to own an asset that:
* You cannot convert back to actual bitcoin
* Does not track in any way the price of the supposed underlying asset
* Has massive maintenance fees which rapidly erode the underlying asset.
* Has no liquidity making it nearly impossible to trade.
I predict the 'fair value' of GBTC once an ETF launches is going to be near zero.

I thought the EU was already going to outlaw the 500 euro note?  And, you have limits on how much cash you can deposit or withdraw from banks.  In fact, any large cash transaction triggers regulatory issues and, at least in the US, can lead to confiscation of your money and criminal arrest.
So, sure, you are free to use cash for cups of coffee and the like, but try to use cash to manage large sums of money, not so much.


The Liberty Dollar and Liberty Reserve as two examples.


That is certainly an attack that would work pretty well.  The only thing preventing that right now is every country would have to more or less agree.  Which they could.  But if bitcoin is legal in some countries, but not others, that creates a host of interesting dynamics.
You may be right.  Maybe we are all just fucked anyway. Governments can just make bitcoin straight up illegal to use.  It could, and still would, survive as a black market currency, but I agree that it's market value would be much less.
All that said, we shouldn't be moving in the direction of making it easier for the State to attack node operators.

I'm not sure you are saying anything that I disagree with other than the fact that the lightning network doesn't exist yet, isn't incorporated into any bitcoin wallet software, and doesn't solve the fact that the current blocksize limit restricts bitcoin to a couple of million users at most, no matter how many small transactions are moved off of the main chain.
Bitcoin can certainly scale by an order of magnitude without any significant risk, we are currently near the limit, and off-chain solutions which might reduce transaction burden are still years away from reality.

The non-contrived sample is that RBF 'detection' is not built into any existing bitcoin wallets and the mere fact that you have no way of knowing, as an end user, that someone sent you an opted-in RBF transaction, **DESTROYS TRUST IN ALL TRANSACTIONS**
It has taken us 5 years to build trust in the existing bitcoin network.  Even as an 'opt-in' feature, the mere fact that someone can execute a replace-by-fee transaction after you have already accepted their original transaction, just the fact that the chance exists, destroys all trust we have built over the past five years.
A new feature which lets someone reverse a transaction after the fact is no feature that anyone wants; 'opt-in' or not.

In the spirit of my original post, I worry that if the bandwidth usage of a typical node starts increasing by orders of magnitude, this becomes an attack vector.  All the state has to do is pass some Bitlicense style regulation that rules all node-operators are MSB transmitters, and then every ISP deems it their responsibility to block or shutdown any user who is running a node.  
It's a lot easier to 'stay under the radar' if your bandwidth requirements are really low!

Yes, the issue is less the price premium and more the liquidity of the asset. What good is an asset if you can't sell it at something resembling market price when you want to?
@_date: 2016-10-27 21:45:21


Thoughts are that GBTC doesn't track the price of the supposed underlying asset, so the 'real value' of GBTC (once an ETF launches) is more likely going to be zero or, at least, far below the supposed underlying asset value.
It's a very, very, risky bet to take.  And, if you want to make that bet, you would be far better served just buying bitoin directly.
For example, for the 'price premium' of GBTC, you could just freaking sell your IRA, take the tax hit now, and buy bitcoins outright.  Or you could just set up a self-directed IRA.
Holding GBTC because you believe in bitcoin as a long-term investment is not wise, IMO.

You got rekt worse than you even realize.  When you sold at $6,600, if that was at a price higher than you originally bought, you just bought yourself a giant ass tax bill.  If it was bitcoin you had held for less than a year, you will pay short-term capital gains at a very high tax rate.

Rewrite history much?  
BTC+Segwit had consensus or it would never have activated.
It was a soft-fork which was activated by vast majority of the network. 
BCH is just a random alt-coin that Roger Ver launched and had a premine of the initial UTXO set. 


Not true.  Segwit never would have activated with 20% support. It had an 80% activation threshold.


This is true.  A minority of the community created an alt-coin called BCH.  They are welcome to their alt-coin, just as Dogecoin, Litecoin, and many other forks of bitcoin have existed for years.
What you can't do, however, is fraudulently claim it "is bitcoin" which it is not.


I know you are repeating falsehoods and I am correcting them.


There is no 'code' associated with a fee market.  RBF, segwit, are both optional soft-fork features which were activated with super-majority consensus of the network.
The code was extensively tested and peer reviewed. There was nothing hacked about it.


It added not only an EDA, but also increased the blocksize, defaced the source code by removing RBF and segwit.  It is now introducing new opcodes.  Every day it is becoming a wild-west exercise in software development, so centralized that it hard-forks at will.


That is not a fact.  The chain which did not hard-fork away retains the exchange token.  There is absolutely zero difference between BCH and bitcoin gold and other bitcoin hard-forks.  They are all just alt-coins which have just as much right to exist, I suppose, as any other alt-coin.  They cannot, however, 'claim to be bitcoin', because that is not true.  And to do so is fraudulent behavior.


I disagree.  I think for Roger it's all about his own ego and power over the bitcoin network.  He may not be able to admit that to himself.  In fact, I'm willing to grant that maybe he believes he is 'sincere in his beliefs' but his actions speak much louder than his words.

@_date: 2016-10-10 23:44:16
I took a little bit of time today, just because I was curious, to answer the question, "How much bitcoin would you have if you bought $100 worth once a week, over the lifetime of the blockchain?"
Here is a link to the google docs spreadsheet containing the data.
I gathered data based on buying bitcoin daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.  While there is some variation based on just happening to coincide with a better price point, in general it didn't make a massive difference. 
For example, if you bought $100 worth of  bitcoin weekly since bitcoin first had a market price (September 2010) you would have $11.1 million dollars (or about 18,000 bitcoins).  If you bought monthly, you would have 12.7 million dollars; though the variance goes down over time.
This post is important, because people always ask the question "Is this is a good time to buy bitcoin?"  The answer appears to be that if you are willing to buy a certain amount, over an extended period of time, then "any time" is a good time to start buying bitcoin.
Even if you hadn't started buying bitcoin until February 28 of this year, you would still be showing an 18% return on your investment.  Sure, maybe you could have done better in the stock market, but the year isn't over yet, and an 18% return is nothing to sneeze at.
I started investing around March of 2013, but I haven't been buying steadily or in equal amounts over time.  Nevertheless, I'm still sitting on well over a 100% return on investment for that time period.
It is important to note, that bitcoin should still be considered a risky investment. Something unexpected could happen tomorrow that would suddenly make the price collapse nearly overnight.
That said, bitcoin has been around with a market price for over six years, and while it certainly has it's ups and downs, it has never 'gone away'.  The best way to deal with these ups and downs, is to 'dollar cost average'; just steadily buy a certain amount over a long period of time.
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:25:19


bi-directional payment networks and sidechains are P2p however.
If you point is, that the bitcoin network is not going to function *on-chain* as a P2P electronic cash system (vs. a settlement layer) then, yes, that's where things seem to be heading by the sheer fact that it is impossible to do on-chain transactions for all of the economic activity of the entire population of the planet earth.

A 72 hour timeout seems to be an absolutely reasonable penalty for making the bone headed mistake of forgetting to include a reasonable fee for a high value transaction.
Every other use case is based on that notion that blocks are always full and there is always a massive backlog. If blocks are always full and there is always a large backlog that is a failure of the bitcoin network. The solution is to make sure that reasonable fee bearing transactions can always be processed.

I've never felt fully comfortable with GBTC for two reasons.  First, because of the premium, which is often irrational and adds yet another layer of volatility on top of bitcoin volatility to begin with.  Plus, bitcoin trades 24/7 but GBTC only trades during regular trading hours.  This can create a massive disconnect in price and Monday mornings can lead to a heart attack waiting to happen.
Second, because it was impossible to make a market order.  That's not so much an issue today, but for much of it's life, you could never match buy/sell orders at anything approximating a market price so every time there was any kind of a market correction you couldn't get out of your position very easily.
Now that the market cap is so high, this is less of a problem, but the premium being irrational still is.  That and this whole current bull market runup is a little bit insane, and you don't want to buy in and be the guy who eats a massive market correction.
I've found other investments which have given me some pretty great returns in the meantime; primarily Tesla and NVIDIA, both of which seem tame by bitcoin/GBTC standards of volatility.

Yeah, but if they would look at the amazing shit that is coming down the pipe they wouldn't 'feel betrayed'.  No one is stopping scaling!  Just the opposite.  People are working their assess off on scaling solutions.  A number of them.
If people were promised **on-chain** scaling then, yes, that opinion has changed but, wisely so.
Satoshi wasn't Nostradamus nor was he Hari Seldon.
We are going to have scaling but, no, rapid large scale on-chain scaling is probably too risky at this time.
Realize there there is a 1.7mb blocksize increase just released in the current code base!  That's nearly a doubling of transaction capacity combined with numerous improvements which will facilitate all kinds of incredible scaling technologies.

The only reason transactions are getting 'stuck' is because the blocksize is being artificially constrained. I have never had a transaction stuck, but I have had transactions take a long time due to the backlog.
Today the two largest bitcoin payment providers are BitPay and Coinbase, both who process tens of thousands of zero confirmation transactions per day.
Do they support RBF? Are you claiming their entire business model is flawed and should go away? That bitcoin should never be used as a online payment network?
Seriously, this is madness. This is a horrible solution to a problem created by the artificially constrained blocksize.
A hard lesson is about to be learned. The vast majority of bitcoin users want the bitcoin network to function as a payment system, as it has successfully acted for years.

No one is basing large financial transactions on zero conf.  People are basing small payments on it taking into account the acceptable low risk.  I am completely befuddled about how this 'feature' no one really asked for, and as far as I can tell, almost no one even wants, was blithely accepted into the bitcoin core. When other developers wanted to incorporate a change which the vast majority of the general bitcoin community wants, a modest increase in block size, debate was suspended, people were banned, and that version of the software was described as an 'attack' on bitcoin and an alt-coin.
To me RBF appears to be far more of an attack on the core principles of the bitcoin network than simply adjusting a single block-size parameter which is a less than a one line code change.
Actually, I think this RBF fiasco is a good thing; because I can't find hardly anyone who wants this 'feature'.  Maybe this is what it will take for the community to realize that there is no 'official' bitcoin core client, there is simply the set of core rules that the community as a whole agrees to.  I can only hope that no miners adopt this change as it is so clearly against the core principles of bitcoin.  Creating a 'feature' which encourages double-spending is deeply irresponsible in my opinion.

Great work, glad you are doing this.
I would expect to see a lot of movement during the BCH fork, as many people (including myself) moved all of their cold storage to new keys to separate out the two tokens.
Also, coins which have not moved for &gt;5 years are quite likely, IMO, lost forever. 
There was an extremely strong incentive to split keys after the recent bcash and bgold hard forks.

Yeah, sure, I will believe it when I see it.

Because over the lifetime of GBTC the premium has averaged between 10-20%.  I have watched the price of GBTC every single day since the day it launched.  The only time this kind of massive premium happens is during a bull-run in bitcoin price and FOMO action kicks in.  The premium always settles back down to reality as soon as a market correction occurred.
This happened less than two weeks ago when the bitcoin price dropped a bit and the GBTC premium narrowed to 10%; which is when I bought in at $190.  I sold at $270 happy to take the profit then.

Let's back up here. The claim is that RBF was allowed to fix stuck transactions. However, it does a whole lot more than that. It provides an official supported path to encourage double spends and fraudulent transactions. RBF also turns a highly constrained blockchain to act as an eBay style auction house where bidding wars can be established to get transactions handled. It is a horrific solution to the blocksize limit problem. Rather than increasing the blocksize limit so that all reasonable fee bearing transactions are safely processed, RBF is designed to create a fee market bidding war.
It is not needed for stuck transactions, you already admit that the 72 hour time out change will gracefully solve that problem.
RBF exists to turn the blockchain backlog into a bidding war. That is why it was created, plain and simple.  Now stop acting surprised that people do not consider this a viable or desirable way to solve the scaling problem.

This is trying to solve a non-real problem.  The existing system is working fine.  People make thousands of zero confirmation transactions daily and there are virtually no issues.  People are having transactions get 'stuck' but, not because their 'fee is to low', but because the transaction capacity of the network is artificially constrained.  
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:51:17


Possibly.  But that attack hasn't happened yet.  I'm pretty sure most people at blockstream would resign immediately if the government compelled them to add AML/KYC etc. to bitcoin.


Yes, they can...but...you would have to coordinate that with every country in the world for it to really work.  If bitcoin is legal in some places, but not others, that could potentially provide huge advantages to the country which doesn't make it illegal.  Bitcoin is slippery, it can re-route in a lot of ways.  People don't call it the 'honey badger of money' without reason.  However, keeping the footprint as small as practically possible is a huge part of the agility for the honey badger.  If you bloat it up, make it huge, make it more difficult to reroute and reorganize, that's a step in the wrong direction.
This stuff isn't all binary.  Like 1mb everything is fine, and 1.1mb everything blows up.  It's on a sliding scale where, as the scale slides upwards, we get into more dangerous territory.  And, even setting the precedent is problematic.


As long as the core bitcoin network is solid, I'm confident layer-2 systems will be able to regroup and reorganize as needed.  You are absolutely correct, layer-2 systems will be attacked too.  However... so long as the main network remains solid and secure, it becomes the firewall that allows us to restructure the layer-2 systems as needed.

You are saying those one year old transactions are still sitting in the mempool? How come the 'fix' for stuck transactions isn't simply aging them out?
Regarding, "what is wrong with the lightning network", the answer is not necessarily anything. The 'problem' is that it doesn't exist, is not integrated into any wallets, is not integrated with any payment processors, and has not had time to develop a level of trust and adoption to be considered a reliable solution for current day problems.

@_date: 2015-10-25 14:14:33


Huh?  What?  You stopped making sense.  Human beings who own bitcoins perform transactions.  What are you talking about?


I didn't make that up either.  The number of transactions allowable per day is well defined by the 1mb limit. This is a basic fact of the network.  There is nothing 'made up' about this.


No, I most certainly did not insist this.  You are reading things that that I didn't say.  What I said is that for someone to own bitcoin, they must be able to perform transactions on the main blockchain.  If you want to use an off chain solution for payment transactions, that is certainly possible, while taking on a certain amount of risk.  However, if a person does not control the private key to bitcoin held on the main blockchain then they don't 'own' any bitcoin.  All they own is an IOU from a third party; typically a bank or an exchange.


Sure, but that won't be bitcoin.  If you can't access the bitcoin network directly, then you can't own bitcoin.  If your only access to bitcoin is through a third party, that is simply a banking relationship which largely defeats the entire purpose of bitcoin to begin with.


That is true.  So, one needs to raise the capacity to support more users.


That is true.  So, that is why I agree with those that state the bitcoin network should be a settlement only network.  The question here is, who can have direct access to the network?  Individuals, or banks?


Agreed, and currently that limit is roughly two million active users.


Well, nodes are not counting on fees currently.  Currently fees are fairly negligible.  However, I agree that eventually fees will become important.  Of course, if the block size is increased the fees will rise correspondingly.


People are giving up on running nodes because they have recently suffered DDOS attacks for doing son.  The main reason they aren't running nodes, however, is that there is no incentive to do so.  The problem of centralization is pooled mining. I assure you that if every individual had a small financial incentive to run a node, we would have an order of magnitude more nodes.


Straw man.  I never suggested any such thing.  I said the blocksize needs to grow to support more users able to hold value on the blockchain.  A fact you have yet to dispute.

A lot of people still haven't grasped the fact that treating bitcoin-core as the only 'legitimate' bitcoin client is flawed reasoning.  There is deep irony in the fact that the small-block-size contingent uses the excuse that larger blocks will hurt decentralization all of the time while they are trying to exercise centralized control over the software and the message forums where the community can discuss these topics.  If you can 'destroy' or 'attack' bitcoin simply by proposing an alternate client, then bitcoin isn't very resilient.  The fact of the matter is that bitcoin can handle this just fine.  The community, at large, will choose which version of the software to run and, whatever they choose, will be the 'official' version, until it is not.
Bitcoin is a permission-less decentralized network. No one needs to 'ask permission' to make a change to the bitcoin software.  Anyone can do it.  It's a free world.  And, anyone can choose to ignore various forks of the bitcoin software.  However, there is no single 'centralized' authority which can bless what is a 'valid client' and what is an 'invalid client'.
I'm not in favor of bitcoin-xt either.  I would much prefer a compromise solution coming out of bitcoin-core.  However, what I am in favor of, is that alternate versions of bitcoin clients have a right to exist as proposals to the community.
If bitcoin-core doesn't start becoming functional again, we will *have* to move to some other client simply to get improvements and bug fixes.  Right now bitcoin-core seems fundamentally broken.  The transaction malleability bug has been a thorn in the networks side for years now and it continues to disrupt things; yet the patch to fix it still hasn't been applied and released.
Moreover, key members of bitcoin-core are against zero confirmation transactions or the network being used for payments.  
Since bitcoin-core seems to be dysfunctional and completely broken, the community must look to alternative versions of the client if we are going to get any bug fixes or improvements moving forward.

Sigh, the blockstream proponents on this forum have been championing a small block size and fee markets, severely crippling bitcoin by making it more expensive and limiting access to a tiny population of people.
Hearn was championing larger blocks so that the bitcoin network could remain accessible, at a low cost, and for a much larger population of people.
So, you are simply wrong on every single count.
Anyone championing small block sizes and a fee market are, quite factually, crippling the bitcoin network. That is a basic fact.
At the current blocksize limit only two million people can actively use the bitcoin network, and that is if these 'active' users only perform two or three transactions per month.
These are basic facts. Now, maybe the lightning network, some day, might help offload a lot of low value transactions and, when and if that happens, that will be great. However, the lightning network does not yet exist in that form and, more importantly, even if it did it will still take years before it is seamlessly integrated into wallets, exchanges, and payment providers.
So, please, stop spreading flat out lies. These are statements of fact. Crippling bitcoin today on the promise of something unproven, untested, and won't be ready for years is absurd.

@_date: 2015-11-08 20:03:27
Because bitcoin behaves like cash and they don't control it. The threat is from digital money held and controlled by banks. That said, the small block proponents seem dead set on destroying all of these features of bitcoin so I'm more concerned about their agenda.
@_date: 2015-11-07 18:38:48
Yes, that isn't what I am talking about.  The bitcoin protocol supports, in theory, a nearly infinite number of users (a number so large it is incomprehensible to the human mind) and it can divide bitcoins down to infinitesimally small sizes, however the network capacity is so small that only a couple of million people can actively use it.  
If one billion people wanted to perform exactly one single bitcoin transaction, it would take decades upon decades for the network to process the backlog.
The current block-size limit, which limits the number of transactions to about 150,000 or so per day ( means that only a couple of million people can 'actively' use the network.  I define 'active' as the ability to perform roughly two transactions per month.  By comparison, I personally performed about 150 transactions *last week*.
There will be some who claim that this limit doesn't matter because people can perform transactions 'off-chain' using Circle or Coinbase.  While this is technically true, it is also fairly useless because off-chain transactions are not decentralized and essentially require a 3rd party business relationship which acts as a bank.
Now, I don't have a problem with using Coinbase, or Circle, to buy or sell bitcoins.  However, if you leave bitcoins with Coinbase or Circle, then you do not actually 'own' them; any more than you 'own' your dollars once you deposit them to a bank.  
The entire purpose of bitcoin was so that people would be able to control their own money without requiring a 3rd party and without risk of government censorship, tracking, or confiscation.  
So, let's not be coy here, unless an 'off-chain' solution is fully decentralized and trustless, then it is not bitcoin.  It is a banking relationship which opens users to all of the risks that bitcoin is designed to protect against. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:28:18

Clearly solving the 'stuck' transaction problem is not the real reason for RBF.  Fixing 'stuck' transactions should be done via a timeout; which is a vastly simpler solution to this problem.
The only 'problem' RBF is meant to resolve is fee markets.  It is being created in expectation that the bitcoin blocksize is heavily constrained, that there is a giant backlog of transactions, and people can 'bid' in this fee market using replace by fee.  That is the real reason RBF is being created; even in the face of the fact that most people in the bitcoin community consider a massive backlog of transactions on the network a major flaw to begin with that should never occur.
We don't need to turn the bitcoin network into an Ebay style auction house and bidding war. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 04:39:24
Your math is wrong. The bitcoin network supports less than 5 million transactions per month. Seriously, do the math.
So, you are saying that 50 million people can perform one transaction every 10 months and the lightning network handles everything else automatically?
That is absurd. You would need one on chain transaction simply to acquire some bitcoin, another on chain transaction to peg some value to just ONE payment channel, and another transaction to settle.
Even being as generous as possible someone would need to perform at least 3 or 4 on chain transactions per month.
That is far less than 2 million active users.
You really think 50 million people can buy bitcoin, open a payment channel (just ONE!) and settle?  That would take years to process.
Explain to me, using the current 1mb limit, how 50 million people can perform 3 on chain transactions a month?

Here is my take on it.  One of the biggest existential threats to bitcoin is trust in the software itself.  With so many reports of hacks that we hear about on a daily basis, people have a completely reasonable right to be skeptical that the whole system could just collapse due to a flaw or attack at some point in the future.
The more companies demonstrate that blockchain technology is completely solid, then the better it is for the value in bitcoin.
Think about it.  If we woke up tomorrow and found out that the bitcoin network had been hacked, all of the value would likely disappear overnight.   That has always been a real and legitimate fear.
The more major players show faith and trust in blockchain technology then, likewise, it demonstrates that it is reasonable to put faith and trust in the long term ability for the bitcoin blockchain to survive as a store of value.
I welcome companies which want to use blockchain technology for fiat based coins.  That is a Pepsi challenge I will take any day of the week.  It shows that digital currencies are the future, that the technology is strong, and that people can easily convert between them.
Given a choice between a digital currency based on fiat and one based on bitcoin, it's an easy decision for me.  That said, I would likely use a fiat based digital currency at times, for the same reasons I want to use bitcoin.  To keep my online transactions secure.
I suspect that any of these fiat based blockchains will also provide as 'features' things most bitcoin supporters do *not* want.
Fiat based digital currencies, even if they are using blockchain technology, will almost for sure restrict access to select and approved participants.  They will almost for sure disallow anonymity.  They may provide support for chargebacks.  They will probably support locking and freezing of funds by government entities.  They will restrict access by country as well.
These will probably be sand-boxes for big banks to move massive sums of money around the world and provide highly regulated and controlled access to consumers.
So, even though they both might use blockchain technology, I think you can see that bitcoins advantages will become quite clear.  Then, the only question will be about volatility and, hey, if you can't stomach bitcoins volatility, I completely get it.  Use fiat coin all you want.
I think both systems will operate just fine side by side, there will even be on-ramps and off-ramps between the systems (like Ripple does today).
I think anyone using blockchain technology is nothing but a net positive for bitcoin for these reasons and more.

I sold half of my bitcoin holdings a little over a month ago, largely because of the BU hard-fork 51% attack threats.  That, and I had invested enough in my bitcoin holdings that it was causing me excessive levels of anxiety.
I took the profits and did some great things with them and the rest of my bitcoins are all essentially free since I've taken out both my original investment and a significant amount of profit.
It's somewhat difficult to think about 'how much money I lost' had I not done that.  On the other hand, I think about how much anxiety I lost as well.  Had I not done that, I would be freaking out even more right now.

Dude, wtf? There is absolutely nothing unethical about writing financial software. Your sense of 'ethics' is really messed up.
Permissioned and non-permissioned blockchains can and will both exist. There is nothing 'unethical' about writing software for either system. It's just code dude, get over yourself and stop making personal attacks against software engineers for the crime of taking a job.
Personally, I welcome permissioned blockchains. If bitcoin is so fragile and weak that it is threatened by banks which adopt elements of the same technology then it doesn't deserve to survive.
Even permissioned blockchains offer a lot of benefits over existing systems. Faster settlement times, more transparency, and far, far, better security. Who wouldn't want those benefits to show up in existing financial networks?
And don't give me this crap about how permissioned blockchains can't work, or there are no benefits to them, because that is simply not true. It is just wishful thinking.
The future will have permissioned and non-permissioned blockchains competing in an open marketplace and bitcoin will find its place in the market. It might end up just being the network for online black market activity, or it might become the next big store of value after gold. Who knows?
But you are naive if you think banks cannot and will not use this technology for themselves, and any software engineer has every right to participate in that effort without compromising his 'ethics'.

It is quite easy to modify a blockchain network to require that participants of mined blocks must sign that block with an approved signature which exists in some named registry.

In this scenario you are only vetting the participants.

You acknowledge that someone could, in theory, hack the credentials of one of the restricted participants but...even if they did..they still couldn't do anything malicious because the private network (now breached) would still be fully protected by the blockchain.

I support bitcoin-xt's right to exist as an alternative client.  I support people's right to run that client.  I support the right of people to freely discuss bitcoin-xt on reddit and other message forums.
As far as whether or not I, personally, am in favor of bitcoin-xt, the answer that that is complicated.  Yes, I'm support of it, but only if bitcoin-core continues to be completely dysfunctional.  What I would prefer is that a compromise solution be implemented into bitcoin-core that sets a clear path to allow more *ACTIVE* users.
I do not believe that the future of bitcoin should be as a payment network.  I think the long-term future of bitcoin should be a settlement only network *THAT EVERYONE CAN USE*!!!!!
I would like to see the vast bulk of all payment transactions to move to offchain *DECENTRALIZED TRUST-LESS SOLUTIONS*.
So, as you can see, what I want, does not exist.  Nor does it appear likely to exist at any time in the near future.
So, unless bitcoin core returns to being a functional development group capable of addressing the needs of the community, then I guess I am in favor of bitcoin-xt, if there is no other alternative client which can move bitcoin forward.
To me it is of critical importance that the block-size be increased soon, not to accommodate more cups of coffee transactions, but rather to accommodate more people able to hold value on the blochain.
Does this sufficiently explain my position?

It is a minor change to the bitcoin software which, if 75% of all miners choose to adopt it, will increase the transaction capacity.
As a bitcoin owner it won't really affect you, or your bitcoins, in any way technically.
It may affect the bitcoin economy, since an increase in transaction capacity allows more people to be able to use bitcoin. And, of course, for bitcoin to succeed at a larger scale it must be able to support more users.
Today, despite all of the press and hype about bitcoin, it can only support about two million active users.

I'm trying to revise my strategy.  I've pretty much always been a pure long-term 'holder'; with a timeline of say five years from now.  That point of view hasn't changed, but what has changed is my attitude about dealing with the repeated boom-bust cycles.
For example, if I had sold all of my bitcoins at over $1,000 and then bought back in at $200, I would have five times as many bitcoins as I do today.
Now, obviously, no one can time the market perfectly, but the fact of the matter is that bitcoin spent months at a valuation much higher and then spent many months at a valuation much lower.
So, let's say instead of selling at a $1,000 and buying back in at $200, I had sold at $750 and bought back in at $250; I would still have three times more bitcoins than I did to begin with.
So...this time, if we see a major correction, I'm going to try to sell, and then buy back in, to increase my total stack.  Obviously not day trading on the one hand, on the other watching large scale trends and benefiting from them is probably a smart idea.

Ok, so we don't need it 'yet' but we add it anyway?  Even though the community seems largely opposed to it.  But you suggest we incorporate it now, 'just in case' we might need it in the future. Meanwhile, we need a blocksize increase immediately and we are not allowed to do something even as simple as just bumping it to two megabytes from one, because the entire decision making process is locked up.  
Think about that?  We could **DOUBLE** the transaction processing of the bitcoin network simply by changing a single  from 1 to 2; but that is considered too scary and risky, even though Satoshi always suggested that raising the blocksize would be a natural thing to do as transaction volume increased.
Instead, RBF is invented as a scorched earth mechanism to deal with an artificially constrained network, and is readily accepted into bitcoin core even though the vast majority of the users of the network are opposed to it.  Sure...makes perfect sense to me.

Obviously that is different for every person.
* You could need $250 to make bail to get out of jail.  Well, that would be life changing.

* Maybe you have $50,000 of student loan debt, so that would change your life.
* Maybe paying off your $200,000 home mortgage would be life changing for you.
* Or maybe you want for life.  Then, you need a number north of a million dollars or so.
I recently sold a big chunk of my bitcoin and paid off all of my children's student loan debt.  That certainly changed their lives.

It seems like your main concern is about centralization of nodes if the blocksize is bigger?
That may well be a concern, but it is not the one that matters.
Currently bitcoin mining is already obscenely centralized due to mining pools.
The reason there are so few nodes is that there is zero economic incentive for anyone to run a full node.
Now, imagine if everyone who ran a full node received, lets say, $10 a month for doing so.  The result would lead immediately to a massive increase in nodes. Because people want bitcoin and, hey, $10 is ten bucks.
Unless we solve the economic incentive problem none of this matters. When a handful of centralized mining pools control the entire network, then I can't imagine things getting any worse.
Whether the blocksize increases or not will have little impact on the tiny number of people already running full nodes. Disk space and bandwidth is cheap. The real issue is that there is no financial incentive to run a full node.
If you care about centralization then try to solve that problem.
And, as I said before. If the blocksize doesn't grow, dude, it doesn't fucking matter. Because the bitcoin network will just serve the same 50,000 geeks and drug dealers who find it useful at that size.

If you aren't desperate for cash it doesn't make much sense to me to sell while the price is rising.

The value isn't there if you can't sell it!  That's like buying a penny stock and looking at your massive paper profit when it's impossible to actually execute a sell order.  I'm not saying GBTC is as bad as that, but it's not that far from it.
If you want to just buy 10 shares or something, then fine.  But if you want to hold 100, 1,000, or more shares, getting into and out of that market is very difficult.
Frankly, the 'underlying asset' of GBTC is kind of a fiction.  Sure, somewhere, somebody, is supposed to hold actual bitcoin to back up a share of GBTC.  Maybe?  It's a bizarre derivative of another asset entirely.  Not to mention massive fees which erode the amount of the underlying asset dramatically and rapidly.  One share of GBTC is **not** worth 1/10th of a bitcoin.  It rapidly diminishes due to the very high fees.  Today one share of GBTC is only worth 0.094 bitcoins and, the longer you hold it, the less bitcoin you have.  Frankly, it sucks.
It's not an ETF.  There is no way to convert GBTC back to actual bitcoins.  
As soon as a real ETF is available then the value of GBTC (based on the underlying asset) should be substantially **LESS** than it's corresponding supposed asset value; simply because it's vastly inferior in every way.
You would be better waiting for an ETF to come online before risking money in GBTC.   The moment an actual bitcoin ETF is announced the price of GBTC will *plummet*.  Not only will the premium vanish but, frankly, I think the entire asset could collapse because it's kind of a piece of shit.  It is only vaguely correlated to actual bitcoin in some bizarre abstract way.  It's like buying a mirage.
Perhaps you don't know what GBTC actually 'is'.  So, Grayscale investments created this bitcoin investment vehicle for high net-worth individuals.  They get **actual** bitcoin.  When they buy into 'BIT' their investment corresponds to actual, provable, bitcoins which, I believe, they can redeem for bitcoins at some point should they wish.
But, that's not what GBTC is.  GBTC is the BIT investment vehicle **repackaged** into some kind of bizarre asset that has no way to convert back to the original bitcoin it is supposedly backed by.
This is so far and away from what an actual ETF should be that comparing the two is not advised.
I fully expect that not only will the price premium on GBTC disappear the moment an ETF is announced but, over time, I expect the entire thing to completely collapse due to how vastly inferior it is to a real ETF in every possible way.
This is the reason I sold all of my GBTC shares.  I feel safer waiting for an actual ETF to come out and invest elsewhere until it does.

Sure... SegWit as a soft fork involves 'tricking' non-upgraded clients to accept non-validated transactions; since the signatures have been moved elsewhere.  
With a hard-fork, it would not require any 'tricks'.  We would simple recognize segwit transactions by *all nodes* and properly process them; fully validating the signatures and making sure the entire ecosystem was upgraded at once; including wallets and other parts of the bitcoin software stack.
Releasing a soft-fork which makes any older software fail to validate signatures and for existing wallet software to fail in unexpected and untested ways, is far more dangerous than a well planned out and scheduled hard-fork.

Either way you are trusting a group of people to act in concert.  Quite frankly, *most* people would trust the banks more.  That's why the market cap of bitcoin is tiny and the total amount of money stored with banks is trillions dollars.
A blockchain processed only by banking computers would actually be preferable to most people and certainly by all governments.
Personally, I prefer bitcoin.  That said, if my bank would let me send USD over a blockchain just like bitcoin, that would be very convenient.

Isn't that like saying there are lots of other metals, so why will gold remain popular?  Let's look at another crypto.  ETH has already had a split into two tokens.  It has an inflation schedule that no one apparently understands.  How many ETH/ETC will there be ever?  An infinite number?  How many more times with ETH split because of a bug or disagreement in the community?
Bitcoin has a bedrock guarantee of only 21 million coins, ever, period, with a well defined issuance policy.  It is by far the most secure of all cryptocurrencies.
You are correct, there is a free market that people can choose from.  Obviously, a lot of people are dumping money into ETH (though for the life of me I cannot understand why).  I think bitcoin is on its way to well establishing itself as digital gold.
As far as 'technical' issues.  Once segwit is adopted, I think bitcoin is going to out tech every other currency. In fact, I wouldn't want to be holding any alt-coin once layer-2 systems start getting deployed in earnest in a couple of years.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:24:23
Same here.  I originally bought GBTC at $27.  And, I was happy holding it in my 401k.  Then Mike Hearn rage quit and I suffered a massive, massive, loss.  I've been gunshy ever since and haven't been comfortable holding any amount of GBTC for any period of time.  I have bought it and sold it as the premium shrank and grew, so I still have made money off of it.
That said, if I had just kept that $27 GBTC and never sold, I would have 1.5million in my 401k today.
Of course, I could have bought the ETH presale and I didn't.
I could have bought some penny stock yesterday, and I didn't.
I try not to live with too much regret any more about 'taking profit', because I hate being the bagholder in the event of a massive market correction.

You can't ignore the fact that we have an existing user base and infrastructure. Whatever you want to say about zero confirmation transactions doesn't really matter relative to the fact that existing payment providers have been successfully using zero confirmation transactions for years and built up substantial businesses and a customer base.
Wallets are important. If I am using an existing wallet how would I know if someone sends me an RBF transaction so I can know to ignore this scammer?
Regardless, this whole discussion is absolutely absurd. No one asked for replace by fee. No one wants it. It solves no problem while it creates many.
Altering the bitcoin software to intentionally support fraud in the form of RBF is absolutely a ridiculous notion and is, and should be, rejected by the entire bitcoin community.

You would secure who can participate the same way you secure bitcoins currently; via signatures.  And, yes, a person could indeed steal a signature or otherwise hack a system.  However, that is the beauty of the system.  They would have to steal the credentials of more than 51% of the systems to be able to steal money.
Someone who stole credentials or otherwise hacked a computer would be detected; and those credentials would be revoked and new ones issued.
In other words, I'm not envisioning a system particularly different than bitcoin currently works today.  
It would still be a peer-to-peer distributed trustless network based on blockchain technology.  The only change is that to join the network, you must have been issued credentials by a central governing body.  
So, in this fashion, the central governing body would control who could, or could not, participate in the network.  They couldn't control the funds or steal money, etc., this group could simply control who is allowed to participate.  Even if a hacker was able to get into the system, they  couldn't do anything malicious because it would be protected by the same logic as bitcoin does today.
Moreover, if they were on a network that doesn't even issue block rewards they would have no incentive to do so.  A hack would not give them access to block rewards (as there wouldn't be any on this network), nor would they be able to double spend or otherwise attack the system.  They would literally have to take over 51% of all of the machines comprising the network; which would be essentially impossible.
I'm not proposing something especially different than bitcoin, I am merely suggesting that it could run on a network which restricts who is allowed to be considered a 'miner' and would not issue block-rewards.  Since these hypothetical miners would be part of a global business consortium who gains larger benefits by being one of the members.

No, not really.  The 'roadmap' has no scheduled hard fork blocksize increase.  It is not on any approved bip.  It has not been merged into the depot.  
Only SegWit, which is not really a blocksize increase per se.  It doesn't gain any benefit **until** virtually every single piece of end user software and infrastructure has been rewritten to support it.
SegWit is desirable, primarily to fix transaction malleability.  However, as a capacity increase, it's rather poor.
Now, I'm sure you already know all of this, so I can only assume you are trolling at this point.


That is not true.  Some softforks are safer, some are not.  SegWit as a HF is relatively clean.  SegWit as a soft-fork is an extremely hacky solution and cludge with a huge ripple effect throughout the software ecosystem.


Already rebutted above.  SegWit is not a capacity increase any time soon; it requires the entire bitcoin ecosystem to upgrade, which will take a very long time.  It will also reduce security for those who do not upgrade. It adds an enormous complexity burden on every piece of wallet software and payment system.


You are wrong.  But, carry on.  If the bitcoin community cannot demonstrate the ability to deploy well orchestrated and planned upgrades to the software (yes, via a HF), on average once very 18 to 24 months, then we are pretty incompetent.
For the record, I have been a professional software developer for over 35 years, and I know a thing or two about deploying software updates.

This is completely untrue.  The value of the blockchain (and corresponding network) is an immutable secure globally shared ledger.  Whether the participants in that network are rewarded by the issuance of coins, or because they do it out of the kindness of their own hearts, or they do it because they are in a shared joint business venture, is beside the point.
You are confusing how people are motivated to participate in proof of work, with the value of the blockchain itself.

Other than that, it really doesn't much matter.  The open source project has been taken over by a different team.  For all we know, the main person who wrote most of the bitcoin code is now dead.
If it turns out that Satoshi is Craig Wright, with his dead programmer, and a wider group, it still doesn't matter; because Craig Wright has proven himself to be a flake of the highest order several times over, having severely damaged the reputations of a number of good people and been repeatedly caught in lies, exaggeration, fraud, and an ego the size of Australia itself.

Isn't the advantage of blockchain technology over something like a secure database is that blockchain technology is resistant to being hacked?  We have recently seen examples where 'insiders' have hacked bank software to steal millions of dollars.  Presumably these were all centralized secure servers but still the hackers got into them.
But, if the network was based on blockchain technology, even if a hacker got at the banks computers, they couldn't spoof or lie to the entire network; unless somehow they managed to get control of the whole network which should be decentralized and physically separated.

I think it is important to remind people that even if LN existed, and worked, it is still relatively useless until it is integrated seamlessly into wallet software and payment networks.
I can buy things, with bitcoin, on thousands of sites, really easily using just my cell phone and wallet app.  It works great.  This took a LOT of work to accomplish. It took years for us to have such nice cell-phone wallets (thanks Mike Hearn!) and years more for integration of bitcoin payments into tens of thousands of online markets (thanks BitPay, Coinbase, and purse.io).
Now, how long is it going to be before I can have LN seamlessly integrated into my Mycelium wallet and into all of the sites which currently handle bitcoin payment processing?
Even if LN existed and worked flawlessly today, it would still take years for it to reach the level of wallet integration and payment channel support that bitcoin has achieved in the past few years.
And, finally, the most important point, no matter how many micro-transactions you try to shove off to some side-chain or payment channel, you are still limited to only a few million people being able to hold any value on the main bitcoin network unless the blocksize increases.
So, even if we get something like the LN which can handle let's say 'billions of transactions', it can only be used by the same few million people who hold any value on the main blockchain to begin with.

Because they still need the benefits of a blockchain of course.  You are just assuming that all blockchains have to be public; they do not.  A blockchain which restricts access to approved participants and encodes regulatory compliance is a perfectly valid way to use blockchain technology.

Eventually, they will.  And, by the time that happens, hopefully we will have off-chain layer-2 networks to relieve the work-load.  Something like the lightning network for example.
However, as you know, the lightning network does not exist yet and, even if it did, it will take years for it to be incorporated into wallets, exchanges, and with payment providers.
So, crippling bitcoin today based solely on the promise of a technical solution that won't be available for years from now, certainly makes no logical sense whatsoever.

Bitcoin does break with more than a couple of million active users. Do you understand basic math? Multiply 150,000 transactions a day times 31 days in a month. Assume every user needs to perform at least two transactions per month to be considered 'active'. Now divide into 100 million people and you will see the fact that bitcoin cannot support that many on-chain users.
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:44:14
Can you explain how transactions on the network today which only 'compress' to 1.8mb somehow are going to fit into 3.7? What gets thrown away?
@_date: 2015-10-24 15:52:02
I would like to ask you a question?  You refer to this 'data center' vision.  A couple of points.  First, even Satoshi acknowledged that eventually bitcoin nodes would move to data centers.
Second, and more to the point, is how do you expect bitcoin to *EVER* service more than a few million active users if the blocksize doesn't grow?
With the current blocksize limit only a couple of million bitcoin nerds world-wide can perform a couple of transactions a month on the main blockchain.
Even if you had a perfect off-chain solution, where 100% of all payment transactions could occur off the main network, still, only a couple of million people could actively hold value on the main blockchain.
When I say 'actively', I mean one or two transactions per month.  Enough to buy some bitcoin (one transaction) and send or peg some value to an off-chain network for payment transactions.
Do you envision a future where only a couple of million people can hold value directly on the blockchain?
What use is that?  If you wanted say 10 million people to be able to hold bitcoin value, how would they do so?  Would they all just have accounts on Coinbase and Circle which, as we know, does not actually amount to really 'owning' bitcoin.  That is just a banking relationship and offers absolutely nothing new or valuable.
Bitcoins major benefit is that individuals can hold and transact value without an intermediary.  Unless the blocksize increases, only a couple of million people could ever actively hold value on the blockchain.
If the blocksize grew to just 8mb, instead of a couple of million people being able to perform 2 transactions per month, woo-hoo, now 16 million or so could.  That is definitely an improvement from where we are today, but it doesn't really solve much.
If you want to keep the bitcoin blocksize fixed at 1mb forever, while that would reduce the cost of running a node (avoiding your feared data-center situation), here is what would have to happen.
* The fee to send a single transaction on the main bitcoin network would rise to $10 to $20 per.
* Only 'banks' and large institutions could afford to do these transactions.
* Almost no individuals, only very wealthy people, could hold actual value on the main blockchain.  Everyone else would have to buy their 'bitcoin' from 3rd parties who hold it on your behalf and make large settlement transactions on the main chain.
This is the future you are proposing?  
@_date: 2016-05-24 19:14:48
Sigh...it makes perfect sense.
**PEOPLE** use bitcoin.
For a **PERSON** to use the LN, they must first hold value on the main bitcoin blockchain, requiring them to perform an on-chain transaction for the 'funding' transaction, and another on-chain transaction to close the channel out.
For the LN to be even slightly decentralized (behaving more like a mesh network than a hub and spoke model), then each user would ideally have, not one open channel, but instead four.  That way they can join the mesh network to help route transactions in the LN channels efficiently.  If the user only has one channel, then the LN will naturally have to form a hub-and-spoke model, forcing all transactions to go through centralized intermediaries.
You do understand that to use the LN each **PERSON** must have an on-chain transaction to open a single channel?
You should also be aware that the LN has many issues with high-value transfer.  It works best with relatively low amounts of value.
This means that each **PERSON** who wants to use bitcoin will have, in addition to a relatively small amount of funds committed to four open channels, will also still perform on-chain transactions if they wish to hold or otherwise invest in bitcoin with higher value.
So..the point here is this, even if the LN allows for scaling a near infinite number of transactions (and it does), each participant, each user, each **PERSON** who wishes to use the LN must perform *on chain* transactions to open and close channels.  
The current blocksize limit means that no more than a few million people can ever use the LN, because that is the maximum number of people who can open and close channels on a semi-regular basis.
I have to ask, seriously.  Are you just trolling, or do you not understand basic concepts like **people** who use bitcoin to hold, store, and transfer value?  People perform transactions.  Since the bitcoin network has a highly gated transaction capacity this means that it, likewise, gates the number of people who can use it actively.  What part of this simple fact do you not understand?
Did you honestly believe that people could use the LN without performing on-chain transactions and, if so, what gave you that ideal?

The proof is not redundant because their are layers of trust!  You trust someone to participate in the network yet, at the same time, you realize that any individual node or collection of nodes could be hacked.  So, you add onto the private network the trustless technology in the blockchain.
Get it?  Layers of trust.  If one thing breaks down, you have a failsafe, and if that breaks down, you have another.  Redundant security because it may well be needed.  Ask all of the people who have had their data hacked by 'trusted' secure systems in the past year.  I'm suggesting laying a trustless system on-top of a secure system; acknowledging the fact that individual secure systems can be hacked.
@_date: 2016-05-24 05:00:18
Your question makes no sense. The LN can process a near infinite number of transactions, since intermediate transactions are not stored, only final settlement transactions.
While, in theory, some of the existing low value transactions on the bitcoin network could be moved off to the LN, the remaining high value transactions would still occur on chain.
More to the point, the LN only scales payment transactions, it does not scale users.
Each user of the LN requires on chain settlement transactions, as well as the ability to both acquire and hold larger value.
The transaction processing capacity of the bitcoin network today, can only support a few million users in this way. 
Even if 100% of all low value payment transactions occur on the LN, the main blockchain limits the maximum number of active users to just a few million people.

"These people" are the users of the software; who are really the most important people of all.  More importantly, hard-forks, otherwise known as a 'software update', when well planned and executed are far safer than insidious soft-forks which can leave dead and out of date versions falling behind the rest of the ecosystem.
I think you've been drinking the wrong koolaid for a while, since you seem to be coming from a perspective where up is down and black is white.
In software engineering providing regular software updates which enhance the features meeting the needs of the end user is how things are supposed to work.
If you ignore your users, they will go away and use something else (i.e. alt-coins in this case).
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that survives and flourishes via decentralized deployment of the software.  Regular hard forks, which provide a clean, concrete, scheduled, and safe way to upgrade the software for the distributed community, are healthy and what we should be doing.

Bitcoin has already survived multiple hard forks without any issues.  There is no need to create more drama than is necessary.  Hard forks are not a 'bad' thing, personally, I would recommend that bitcoin have regularly scheduled hard forks at least once per year.


This is simply untrue.  bitcoin-xt only goes live months after a specific data *next year* and then only after a super majority is met.
At any rate, bitcoin-core development is broken right now due to the fact that it is in a frozen state, unable or unwilling, to move bitcoin forward.

Transactions on the bitcoin network are censored all of the time!  They are deemed 'invalid' and thrown away; because the consensus of all miners makes an agreement as to what is considered a valid transaction and what is not.
These transactions are simply censored in a way that the collective group of miners agrees to; based on the bitcoin software they are running.
Anyone could create a bitcoin blockchain which censors transactions based on any number of a set of arbitrary rules.  Whether anyone would want to use such a blockchain is the big question.

I would very much love an off-chain solution. It isn't that I lack the imagination, it's that I don't count on things that don't exist.
Moreover, even if we had a true trustless decentralized off-chain network, and it was seamlessly integrated into all wallet software and payment networks, we still have a problem.
If your goal is that individuals should be able to hold value on the bitcoin network, value they could transfer through sidechains, there remains a major problem.
The only way to hold and peg value on the blockchain requires at least a few transactions per month. However, with the current blocksize limit only a couple of million people could do this.
Of course you can avoid all of these issues if you simply use centralized off-chain solutions like coinbase or circle. But I think neither of us want that.

I didn't even discuss the technical reasons in my post.  Which drives me nuts that 'big blockers' don't understand the most basic facts about the matter.
* Networks can scale linearly, to a certain degree, up until they reach the limits of what's feasible.  Meaning, if you have a server which can handle 1,000 users, you can buy a server which is twice as powerful and now support 2,000 users.  However, you very quickly hit a hard limit this way, because servers which are, say, 10x times more powerful do not exist.
* You scale exponentially not by getting an ever larger and larger server, but rather by spreading the work-load across multiple servers.  With bitcoin, this means you create additional 'sidechains/shards' of the network that new users can participate in.  All of these servers can be hyper-linked/connected in such a way that is invisible to the end user.  
All networks scale exponentially by adding additional layers.  Why should bitcoin be any different??

I 100% agree that bitcoin should become a settlement only layer.
The problem at hand is how do we get there, from here?
It will take years before layer-2 solutions like the LN exist in a form capable of offloading a substantial number of payment transactions from the bitcoin network; if ever as there are still many challenges.
If someone were to deploy a fully functioning, feature complete, LN implementation today, it would offload exactly zero transactions.
For it to offload transactions, first, a number of bitcoin wallet applications would need to be written to support it.  However, that might only solve the peer-to-peer use case.  Until payment processors, exchanges, and others support it, it wouldn't be able to take off.  Next is probably the the biggest challenge; convincing anyone to even use it.  It will take a long time before a substantial number of people will be willing to commit value to a LN channel and use it for day to day transactions.
As well, the LN has numerous issues with the high-value use case.  So, it's only 'killer app moment' is to offload low value payment transactions.  While a substantial number of bitcoin transactions today are for relatively low value, which are good candidates to move to the LN, there are still many left.
Here is a graph showing the number of bitcoin transactions daily sorted by the size of the transaction.
As you can see approximately 35% of transactions are  for less than 0.01 bitcoin (about $5), which would be easily moved to the LN you would hope.
Roughly 70% of all transactions are for less than about $100 worth of value.  For anything higher than that, it will be a long time, if ever, that these can be moved to a layer-2 network.
The bigger issue, is even if 100% of all payment transactions are moved to something like the LN, still, each user must hold value directly on the bitcoin blockchain in the form of opening and closing channels.  And, not just one channel, but likely more.  If each end user only has a single channel, then the LN will naturally form a hub-and-spoke model which has numerous issues.  
For the LN to behave more like a mesh network, then each user would likely have four channels open.  This creates a lot of on-chain transaction pressure per user.
For a few million people, this should work fine.  However, if you want bitcoin, with layer-2 networks, to scale to tens or even hundreds of millions of people, then the blocksize would have to grow by orders of magnitude to support all of those channel transactions.
There is a myth that people can just open one huge channel, and never close it, but there are numerous problems with this scenario, not the least of which is that people cannot afford to tie up that much bitcoin ahead of time, plus channels naturally become unbalanced and this would lead to a hub and spoke network configuration with centralization risk complete with full AML/KYC requirements for users to get their channels established.  Not to mention the fact that this is all a remarkably complex way to simply send a payment.
As well, people will still want to do large value transactions directly on chain.
The actual solution to the problem of scaling is that it requires both more on-chain transaction capacity as well as moving low value payments to layer-2 networks.
The only scenario I see that could resolve this issue fully is sidechains.
Sure, the wealthy can afford to pay high transaction fees to move massive amounts of money around directly on the main bitcoin blockchain.  For everyone else, it might work if they could utilize pegged sidechains for their lower value needs and, just like your 'World of Warcraft' analogy, we can 'shard' the bitcoin network by firing up ever more, and more, instances of sidechains to onramp more users.  
The cool thing is that the LN can inter-operate across multiple sidechains, so you won't have a problem of person (A) being on one sidechain being unable to send value to person (B) who is on another.  The LN can link the two sidechains together via enforced smart contracts.

I didn't make anything up. The raw numbers are quite clear. If you do not personally control a private key to bitcoin stored on the blockchain then you do not 'own' bitcoin. And, as things stand today, only a couple of million people can actively access value on the blockchain.
Please be specific. How do you think, lets say 100 million people, could 'own' some bitcoin under the current system with 1mb blocks? 
With the current blocksize limit it would take nearly two years (666 days), using 100% of the transaction volume 1mb blocks can support, for 100 million people to do a single transaction on the blockchain.
If people don't hold private keys giving them access to bitcoin on the blockchain then they don't 'own' bitcoin. The best they might do is 'own' an IOU from a bank holding alleged bitcoin on their behalf.
This discussion isn't about cups of coffee or other use cases for the bitcoin network as a payment channel, but rather how many people can hold value directly on the blockchain. If they must resort to 3rd parties, such as banks, to 'hold' their bitcoin for them that pretty much defeats the entire reason bitcoin was invented in the first place.
This isn't rhetorical. I really want to know. How do you think a 100 million people could hold value on the bitcoin network with 1mb blocks? Do you consider coinbase, circle, exchanges, and banks which hold bitcoin on the users behalf as an acceptable alternative?
I really want to know.

No, that is not correct.  Banks do *not* currently run global world wide shared ledgers.  They each have their own ledgers and then they use a network (SWIFT) to submit push/pull requests.

Based on feedback from the community, I refactored my blockchain parser program to be much simpler and easy to follow.  The new code is located at the link above.
This version uses the STL 'unordered_map' to build the hash maps for transactions and blocks. It does not pre-allocate memory.
It also does not have all of the complex analysis code nor does it collate and total the contents of all public key addresses that the old version did.  The previous version gradually grew too complex for people to easily follow the code.
In the interest of simplicity, this now simply parses each block in the blockchain and can print out the complete contents of each, largely matching the same information you would see in a blockchain explorer.
I intend to revise this code in the future to add more analysis and accumulation of public key statistics, but not right away.  In the meantime, this is being provided as a free open source educational tool.

I agree, I would like to have a bitcoin payment option; not just with Netflix, but with all online sites. I used to really think getting people to use bitcoin as a payment network was a big deal and a major use case. But now we are told that the bitcoin network is a settlement only network, one where at the maximum users might make two transactions a year, to store or retrieve their digital gold.
Considering that is the position of bitcoin core today, it becomes hard to get excited about anyone trying to use bitcoin as a payment system any more.

For fees I would assume they are close to zero. Certainly they should be treated as a percentage of the value transferred at worst to accommodate true microtransactions. This is the thing LN should do well.
I think experimenting with more configuration permutations is useful.

Little has changed??  Are you serious?
Since the last time we had massive fees and a huge mempool here is what has changed.
* Segwit adoption has dramatically increased; more wallets, exchanges, users, all support it. Including, finally, Coinbase.
* Transaction batching by exchanges has dramatically increased, making much more efficient use of the blockspace available.
* Millions and millions of UTXOs have been consolidated.
* The lightning network has been deployed on mainnet.  And while it's not offloading any significant number of transactions at this time, it is still a major technological achievement that shows the way forward will work.
* RSK launched, and while few people seem to notice or pay attention, the fact that there are functional sidechains is still a pretty big deal.
With these changes to how people are using the network, the mempool backlog we saw back in December would have been completely cleared today.
So, enough with this 'nothing has changed' narrative.
The community learned that the blockchain is a valuable resource and they are now acting as better stewards, by not abusing it with inefficient practices.
Also, and I don't think enough people recognize this, the fact that people were willing to pay massive fees during that time, *as painful as it was*, was also an incredibly positive development too.
It showed that sending bitcoin was **so valuable** to people that they were willing to pay very high fees.  Fees so high that the fees themselves were beginning to compete with the coinbase subsidy.
Why is this so important?  Because the plan of record for bitcoin is that fees need to begin replacing the block-reward subsidy, which is decreasing far more rapidly than most people realize.  This isn't something to 'worry about in a 100 years' but something that will be happening rapidly over the next 20 years.  The block-reward decreases **exponentially** and will be going down to a minuscule amount far faster than most people realize.

Listening to that CW rant was an experience. He was wrong so many times it was staggering. Especially his attacks on Segwit, which were the most disingenuous; as well as his claims fixing transaction malleability wasn't important. Just flat out wrong.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:14:31
Currently there are a group of developers holding bitcoin hostage in an attempt to prevent it from growing. They are against an increase in the blocksize, they are in favor of fee markets, and they are against zero confirmation transactions. They have also failed to do anything about the transaction malleability bug. Additionally, if anyone proposes alternative solutions they are attacked personally, discussion is censored, and anyone who runs a client which supports larger blocks are being subjected to DDOS attacks.
This is the situation we find ourselves in today. I USED to think that resolving the scalability issues would be no big deal, but I no longer feel that way. Now I feel that the bitcoin network is broken and frozen in place with its current limitations.
Finally, for someone to actually own ANY bitcoin they MUST perform a transaction on the blockchain. Anything else, using some off-chain centralized system like coinbase or circle, is not actually bitcoin. That is just a bank holding funds for you with non of the protections provided by directly owning the bitcoin yourself.
If this person is lucky enough to actually hold value on the bitcoin network and they would like to use some off-chain system for micro-transactions, be it for changetip or fold-app, they must still execute at least one additional bitcoin transaction to transfer funds from their main blockchain wallet over to the off-chain network.
That means at least two transactions are required; one to buy bitcoin in the first place and a second one to deposit funds into their fold/changetip/side-chain/lightning-network account.
Regular users can be expected to make a minimum of at least two transactions per month directly on the bitcoin network.
Since the bitcoin network can only support about six million transactions a month that means only three million people can expect to do two transactions a month.
If your suggestion is that users can hold bitcoin, 100% off of the blockchain, using Coinbase or circle, well, thanks but no thanks. Then it is just a bank acting as a trusted third party which is useless as far as I am concerned.
The bottom line is that more than a few million people need to be able to control THEIR OWN private keys!

People who have been repeatedly abducted by aliens are being subliminally programmed to purchase bitcoins by their controllers. The aliens, mostly grays from Zeta Reticuli, intend to control the future one world government through manipulation of the global currency.

In some sense, sure, yeah.  I mean how can you not 'regret' missing out on making tens of thousands of dollars more money if you had just waited a couple of months?
However...look at the time when I made this decision.  The ETF had been denied.  There was an active BU HF attack.  The price had crashed substantially.  There was just an enormous amount of uncertainty in the market.  I'm not sure who could have predicted this current runup in the price, I certainly wouldn't have predicted it, and I still don't understand why it's happening.
That said, this is true of any asset you sell and take profit on.  Sure, it 'could' have gone up.  It also 'could' have just as easily gone down.  
What didn't change is what I did with the money, and I'm very happy with that outcome.
My selling about half of my bitcoin resulted in the following.
* I got 100% of my entire original investment back out.  Not just what I spent on those bitcoin, but the ones I still have left. My effective cost basis, at least in my own mind if not for tax purposes, is now zero.  Speaking of taxes, another reason I did this is that I recently sold a bad real estate investment and realized a $40,000 loss.  I was able to offset that loss against the bitcoin gains for tax purposes.  That was another motivating factor in selling at the time.
* I not only got my entire original investment back out, but I also took a lot of profit as well.  So, not only can I say I never lost any money in bitcoin, no matter what happens, I can also say that I made a lot of money off of it as well.
* Now that I took my original investment back out I no longer have any worries about the remaining bitcoin I own.  When I had a lot of money still personally invested I had a lot of anxiety over it.  In other words, I had invested 'more than I was willing to lose'.  Now I feel like I'm 'playing with the houses money' and I don't really stress about the price.
* Bitcoin is still available for sale. There is nothing preventing me from buying on the dips.  In fact, the last time it dipped around $900 I did actually buy a little bit more.  If I want to slowly add to my stash again, I can.  Nothing is stopping me.
* The biggest thing of all, is what I did with that money.  I paid off about $90k of student loans for two of my adult children.  This, to them, was life changing.  How much this changed their lives, and removing financial anxiety and burden on them, was worth far, far, more than my desire to hold onto those bitcoin.
In this respect, I would still recommend the same to others.  If selling some of your bitcoin, and taking some big profit, can affect a major change in your life, I recommend it.  I don't ever recommend selling all of your bitcoin to anyone, but selling some, once it has become worth 'too much to lose', doesn't seem irrational to me.
As I said, if you change your mind later, it's still available for sale.

I like that the core devs think and care about these issues. From the big-block crowd I get virtually no sense of cypherpunk ethos.
I'm all for experimentation but risking the main chain seems ill advised.

I don't know of many people who are against SegWit; just many who are of the opinion that it would be safer and more prudent to do it as a HF rather than an ugly and very hacky SF.


Yes, it is.  That is why we need it, and have needed it for many, many years.


It does not double the blocksize.  In fact, it has no affect at all until the developers and users all adopt new software, not yet written.  You see, even if SegWit is deployed, there will be no transactions to take advantage of it, because no wallet software, payment providers, bots, or exchanges support it.  For it to achieve even something approximating a doubling, nearly 100% of all bitcoin software has to be rewritten and every single user of that software having upgraded.
Hint.  That's gonna take a while.  A long while.  
Clearly, a 2mb HF, which could have been done safely months ago, would have been the less risky and more concrete solution.


Who are you talking about?  I've written several articles and done a podcast praising the LN, and why it is so important to remove the approximately 70% of low value transactions from the bitcoin network.
However, like SegWit, the LN will not be able to offload any transactions until every single piece of bitcoin software will have to be completely rewritten, all of the exchanges, payment providers, wallets, bots, scripts, you name it, it all has to be rewritten before it can route payment transactions through the LN.
And, of course, even if all of that software was written, you would have to convince the general bitcoin user to start using it.  This will take **years** to accomplish, even after version 1.0 of the LN is 'launched'.
And, of course, the LN can practically speaking only off-load about 70% of bitcoin transactions, and also will add additional transaction pressure as more members of the general public begin to use the LN and require their own on-chain bitcoin accounts.


Bitcoin was created as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system for anyone to use.  It should be available to all, not only the extremely wealthy and banks.

The blockchain and network creates a global immutable shared ledger.  Whether people get paid to validate the ledger, or they do it out of the kindness of their hearts, or because it is a closed business model, none that matters.

Segwit **is** a scaling solution.  In so many ways.  First, it provides a near doubling of transaction capacity.  That's an effective 1.8mb blocksize limit, which is a substantial capacity improvement over today.
Second, segwit will usher in and enable additional networking layers; which is how bitcoin will be able to scale exponentially to meet world-wide demands while, at the same time, not putting the core bitcoin network at risk.
If you try to scale 'on-chain' first, you can only scale a relatively small amount in a linear fashion safely. It will never scale on-chain to act as a direct payment network for worldwide global usage.  That will simply never occur.  If we did try to do that, it would turn bitcoin into something else entirely that would destroy some of its most important properties while, at the same time, still not serving the use case for worldwide global demand.
If, instead, you introduce features to the network in the form of additional layers, those layers cannot, and do not, threaten the core network (and the value it stores and protects) in any way!
On these other layers you can have big blocks, mimblewimble, dash-like features, ethereum like features, bi-directional payment channels, and more and more.  None of these layers can, or will, threaten the base network in any way.  Each layer can offer it's own specific features, do it's own kinds of experimentation, offer its own security model, all the while still enhancing the bitcoin network and sharing the same base value token.
The future for scaling bitcoin has never been more promising.  If only technically naive people, or those who do not understand the balance of security and risk, would stop pushing for simplistic solutions that, in actuality, solve nothing and would threaten the network in the end.

So you keep saying....but nevertheless zero confirmation transactions are currently accepted by nearly every single online merchant.  If someone has to wait 10+ minutes (and as the constrained blocksize and fee markets develop, it might take *hours* to get a confirmed transaction), you have just completely destroyed any possibility of the bitcoin network of ever being used for payments.
However, I am using bitcoin as a payment network today.  I use it all of the time.  And I *NEVER* have to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation.  Clearly the current system *DOES WORK*.

So....actually.. this is not entirely true.  You can create a blockchain easily enough on a closed proprietary network where the participants are all in agreement without a monetary reward as incentive.
Realize that a blockchain does *not* have to represent a monetary token.  It is merely a database.  Yes, you do need some kind of financial reward if you expect the general public to run the software to validate transactions; however, that is not a requirement.
A business (like a bunch of banks) can run their own private blockchains only accessible to their partners.  I suspect any number of proposed 'fiat-coin' systems will be extremely closed; yet still use blockchain ledgers to validate transactions.

You can actually scale bitcoin on chain quite a bit without hitting any hard technological limits.  However, even that is a tiny drop in the ocean compared to global world wide usage for all use cases large and small.  There is no way to scale on-chain for that use case, no matter what Craig Wright says.
At the end of the day, most payment transactions need to occur on other layers.

I don't get what you are trying to say.  You are aware that the majority of the hash power in the world has the ability to completely fuck shit up and split the coin into two tokens creating massive market uncertainty and chaos?
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:10:15
I think my original point is quite valid.  The fact that bitcoin lets you transmit value nearly instantaneously around the world, irreversibly, and anonymously, makes it insanely easy to steal relative to other forms of value.
A lot of people claim that it isn't really anonymous, but if that is the case how come virtually no one who steals bitcoin is ever caught by tracking them through the blockchain?
People follow the first couple of hops and quickly get lost afterwards.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:50:26
Two reasons.  First, selling bitcoin has major tax consequences. If you have experienced significant gains and you are in a high tax bracket, the taxes could eat up a lot of your profits. Second, to be safe in the event of a potential split leading to two viable tokens, you want to hold your own bitcoin prior to any such split.
@_date: 2016-05-24 01:22:34

You can create ten forks of bitcoin a day. There is nothing stopping anyone from doing that. No permission is required. However, getting your coin listed on all of the world's exchanges as "the bitcoin", good luck with that. That is the challenge that faces BU and nChain. They can fork all they want. But will their fork coin be called 'bitcoin' by GDAX, Gemini, BitPay and others? Miners don't control that decision. The economic majority does.

ChangeTip is a service provider which links your social media accounts (reddit, twitter, facebook, etc) and gives you access to a hosted bitcoin wallet.  You are only supposed to put very small amounts of bitcoin there, essentially pocket change, used for tipping.
You can deposit bitcoins into your changetip hosted wallet and you can also withdraw funds as well.
Actual tips do *not* go onto the bitcoin network; which is a positive thing because there is no point in cluttering up the main bitcoin network with low-priority microtransactions.  At least that is my opinion on the topic.
ChangeTip is a free service though I imagine, at some point in the future, they will probably skim a small percentage off of the tipping transactions if it ever grows large enough; which would be a perfectly reasonable business model if that is their plan.
For the rest, just read their website and view their tutorial videos.

The vast majority of the worlds wealth is already controlled through centralized systems.  It is the status quo.

In the mempool it doesn't store duplicates?  Meaning when it sees a new transaction, before placing it into the mempool, it first confirms if it is already represented (regardless of whether or not it produces a different transaction hash) and then throws it out?

Dude. Realize you are making a decades long investment and anything short of that is noise. If you panicked, that means you probably invested more money than you are willing to lose.
Make a long term binary bet where the outcome is either a large return or zero. Give yourself a timeline of at least several years.

@_date: 2015-03-13 18:27:04
Agreed.  What you seem to be missing here is that you can create a blockchain network where the only miners who are allowed to participate are vetted!  Meaning, it works just like bitcoin *but* not everyone is allowed to participate.  Obviously who is, or is not, allowed to participate would be based on cryptographic signatures which are controlled by a central governing body. (It is worth noting that Ripple already works somewhat like this today!)
You cannot understand that a blockchain network can be created that works almost exactly like bitcoin does today yet is restricted to a specific group of people via cryptographic signatures?

So, let me note something here.
Recently, like in the past two weeks, the price of bitcoin shot up from the low $200's to nearly $300.
That rise was based on speculation that the launch of GBTC would create a lot of buy pressure.
Today the price is dropping because, popular theory, some criminals are dumping their stolen money.
Now, realize, if you are waiting to buy into GBTC before it launches anything that lowers the price ahead of time is to your benefit.

I would like to add an editorial note to this thread. I posted this on both and here yesterday. This is a post which exposed a scam that cost a lot of people a small amount of bitcoin but, in aggregate, a substantial sum. (Just the single transaction which swept my two cards stole over 5btc, and that was just one of probably many such transactions.  The address these funds were swept to got over 85 bitcoins total.)
This is generally useful information to the bitcoin community, and was confirmed by others.
On the post received upvotes, discussion and, most importantly, independent confirmation.
On the post was completely ignored.
Since it wasn't complaining about core, or ETH, or otherwise being negative on the blocksize or censorship topic, it was deemed by the community as essentially off-topic.
This shows me that for actual bitcoin news, is functioning better.

If that were true why did the premium shrink to zero the moment there was even a rumour of a competing product?
The only reason there is a premium is because there is no competing product.
You do realize that you still have to pay taxes on IRA/401k right?  It's not like it's tax free or something.  Taxes are merely deferred until you make a withdrawal.
Long term capital gains tax rate in the US is between 0 and 20% depending on how much money you are make.
Since your worst case tax scenario if you just buy and hold bitcoin outside of a retirement account is 20%, it's hard to imagine why a price premium of over that amount would ever be justified.
The point being, just buy and hold bitcoin directly.

Because it wouldn't solve the scalability issue.  It would be a short term 'quick fix' to double capacity.  I'm in favor of doing that myself too.  I have been for a long time.  But, it's nothing more than a 'kick the can down the road' type of thing.

Sorry I didn't make myself more clear.  I agree with your point that an individual can keep his own private keys safe.  However, since the only thing needed to 'steal' bitcoins is access the private key, thieves are highly motivated to get those keys by any means necessary.  This goes from an individual on up to computer systems which can be hacked or simply be stolen by an 'inside-job'.
It's not that cash and gold and other things of value cannot be stolen, but bitcoins are a lot easier to steal, as we have seen time and time again.  We hear of major bitcoin thefts now on a daily basis.

The bitcoin protocol isn't going away. That protocol fuels most alt-coins.
What is not certain is which network using that protocol will end up being the dominant one.
This is usually decided by "network effect", the more people who use the network the more useful it becomes.
Bitcoin has always held that network effect advantage, and still does, but it is not a guarantee; because bitcoin has extremely limited ability to grow the user base.
So, yes, the bitcoin protocol will live on, whether in Ethereum, Litecoin, or something else. But the bitcoin network is not guaranteed to succeed long term.
For seven years it was promoted as a payment network which would, and could, scale once demand increased.
That contract with the user base has now been broken. It is being transformed into a low bandwidth, high fee, settlement network with limited user access.
Now, that is not to say that bitcoin cannot succeed as a Gold 2.0 store of value system, but can it keep its network effect going once the original reasons most people got involved in it are no longer valid.

So, I made a lot of money trading GBTC. I could have made a lot more than I did (I originally bought GBTC at $27), however I frequently went in and out of my position to limit my exposure.
Currently I'm 100% out. The main reason? The lack of liquidity. There are no market orders for GBTC. The spread between buy and ask is often 5-10%!!!!
I have, personally, moved the price of GBTC by almost $10 just trying to get out of my position before.
If you see the price at say $100, that isn't actually the price. That's just the last time a rare and infrequent trade was made.
The price premium is less of the issue. I mean, at the end of the day, if you can make money trading some asset what does it matter? It's the fact that if there is a price correction, you highly likely will not be able to get out of your position.
As I write this GBTC is trading at an effective bitcoin price of $1,060.
Even if you want a long position, better to wait for one of these ETFs to finally happen. Or do a self directed IRA and just buy and hold bitcoin directly.
Right now I'm trading Tesla and Solar City stock. They are both just as volatile as bitcoin, in fact more so, but you can execute massive market orders instantly without fear. And, I've done really well trading that crap.
What I have learned (and I'm very new to stock trading) is that by watching bitcoin for over three years the knowledge I've learned transfers well to any other volatile stock that trades primarily on hype.

Network.  As in a bunch of computers talking to each other over the internet.
When a bitcoin node launches, it reaches out to find other nodes to talk to.  Those nodes, which talk to each other, all comprise a peer-to-peer network.
Now, if someone creates a modified client and attaches it to the *SAME* network, then they are conducting an attack on that network if their node does not follow the same consensus rules.
However...if they modify their code to connect to other nodes *on a different network* then it is an alt-coin.

I think you missed my point.  It's not that an individual cannot secure his own keys, but, all someone has to do is know that you have a Trezor, then put a gun to your head and say 'send the money to my address'.
The point here is that bitcoin is easier to steal that say a bank-vault full of gold or cash.
There is a reason people don't walk the streets with thousands of dollars of cash in their wallet; but that is what you are doing when you carry a trezor.

Most of the advice on here is fine but just to give a contrary view, I do believe that 'paper' wallets can be a sound way to use as long-term cold storage, but with a lot of caveats.
* I put 'paper' in quotes because I don't mean an actual physical piece of paper (though there is nothing wrong with that too) but multiple backups in both digital and print form stored in numerous locations
* Never put a raw unencrypted private key anywhere!  Always use BIP-38 encrypted paper wallets with a very secure decryption key that ideally has not been written down anywhere!

I invest in it as if it were to become a mainstream store of value in the future, essentially gold 2.0, several years down the road.
I don't invest in it based on it's utility, or lack thereof, as a payment network.  I treat it as just a way to safely and securely store wealth that cannot be touched by hackers or the state, and I can transfer around the world quickly and inexpensively.

If your bitcoin is on coinbase then you **do not own your bitcoin**!  Coinbase owns your bitcoin, and holds it on your behalf. 
This is the same thing as putting money in a bank and saying it is 'your money'.  It's not 'your money'.  It's the banks money and they are holding it for you on your behalf.  They may, and/or may not, give it back to you.
If the police *suspect* you might have committed a crime (you don't have to be proven guilty of a crime, they can simply suspect you of it), they can confiscate the money.  They can literally 'arrest your money' and you will probably never git it back (this is called 'asset forfeiture' and the police steal billions of dollars of people's money this way) 
If a legal judgement is filed against you then you will quickly find out that it is not actually 'your money'.  If the IRS thinks you haven't been paying your taxes, your money can be confiscated.
The simple fact of the matter is that unless you personally control your own money (either cash, gold, or bitcoin private keys) it's not, technically 'your money'.  It belongs to someone else and they are letting you access it only with their permission and with the right to block access for a variety of reasons.
All that said.  Coinbase is a lovely company. They are nice people.  But they are subject to financial regulations and leaving your money on their site is not recommended.
From Coinbase's own blog they state that customers should withdraw their bitcoin if the customer is worried about a hard-fork event.
I strongly recommend everyone remove all of their bitcoin from all exchanges and 3rd party sites prior to August 1st.

Yes, for tax purposes you *should be* tracking every time you buy crypto and every time you sell it.  This is what happens when you buy and sell stocks on any exchange and, at the end of the year, they generate a tax form showing gains and losses which is kindly shared with the IRS.
You have a legal responsibility to do the same thing for all of your bitcoin transactions.  This is something I have done personally, but I'm skeptical everyone is doing this.
Also, if you sell some bitcoin to buy ETH and then sell the ETH and buy bitcoin, etc. those also represent taxable gains and losses that you are legally required to self-report to the IRS.
The bottom line is if you sell some crypto and deposit a big pile of USD in your checking account, I would strongly advise you to report the gains on your taxes.  The chances of you eventually getting caught are very, very, high.
I meticulously track all of that myself and have paid taxes every time I have ever sold bitcoin.  If you sell bitcoin that is over 1 year old, then it is subject to long-term capital gains.
The reality is I don't think many people are actually doing this.  A lot of people somehow think that if they sell bitcoin to buy another crypto that this isn't a taxable event. It most certainly is.  It's no different than selling gold to buy silver.  
You are also supposed to track and report your gains and losses when you use your crypto to 'buy' something.  I know for sure almost nobody is doing that.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:49:42
Yeah, I'm one of the biggest anti-ETH guys here.  I've been trashing ETH since before it existed.  And, after all this time, my opinion of ETH has not changed.
I did serious due diligence.  Not only did I argue online with Vitalik a bunch, I went the extra mile and downloaded, built, and reviewed all of the source code.  Heck, I even changed a couple of lines of code and submitted a pull-request.
I was considering spending about $2,000 buying ETH during the presale but the fact that it was a pre-mine stunk so bad to me, offended my sensibilities so much, I decided not to.
And, as rational as my decision sounds even as I describe it again here, the reality is that had I bought $2,000 worth of ETH during the presale, I would have made like a million dollars are something like that.
So, obviously, even if I made a good technical decision, I made a shitty investment decision.
I can sit here and read off the laundry list of why ETH sucks, and it does indeed completely suck, but apparently the market doesn't agree.
And, frankly, now bitcoin sucks too.  I paid a $7 fee to send someone $20 worth of bitcoin just to get them started the other day.  The fact that the future of bitcoin is in the hands of two guys, Roger Ver and Jihan, is a really, really sad state of affairs.  The extreme mining centralization.  The lack of progress on segwit, sidechains, and payment channels, is all very discouraging.
So, I think ETH sucks and I think bitcoin is stuck.  
Good thing my bitcoin have a cost basis of $0, that way I don't have to worry about it.

The seal covering the private key has not been removed; it is scratched but that is from sitting in my nephew's wallet for the past three years.  Neither of them are scratched off enough to read the private key however.

I agree that anyone can write a new article and post it. Rewriting or amending someone else's article is not cool. An article is not a piece of C++ code. I write open source code all of the time with the intention that other people will modify it, and that is totally cool.

Transactions which happen on LN would not be useful on-chain. Economic equilibrium will always be reached over time. For example, if 50 million people tried to open a single LN channel at once it would swamp the bitcoin network.
As usage grows simply opening and closing LN channels would fill the on-chain capacity and fees aggregate to the main network.

You report it to your accountant and he will fill out the appropriate forms on your taxes.  If you don't have an accountant, well, not sure, but it gets reported exactly the same way as you would report stock trades.
As soon as I started buying and selling stocks extensively I stopped doing my own taxes.  Not that I couldn't figure it out, I just feel more comfortable having a professional do it for me.  An H&amp;R Block type person could handle it fine.
Here is a sample of the spreadsheet I use to report taxes to my accountant.
I created this spreadsheet to exactly match perfectly, line for line, to the same reports I get from my Fidelity brokerage account for all of my stock trades that I also submit to my accountant.
Note that there is one section for long term gains and another for short term gains, which are taxed at a different rate.  Long term gains means you held the bitcoin for more than a year before you sold it.

Think of it this way.  If every single millionaire on the planet wanted to own just one whole bitcoin, they could not.  There are more millionaires than bitcoin.  If you can buy a fraction of one now, and then continue adding to your position over the next year, you might be able to get a whole bitcoin and I think you should consider that quite an accomplishment.
It's doubtful you will ever see bitcoin below $2,000 ever again.  It could happen, but I wouldn't bet on it.

I would much rather prices stay the same and bitcoin be used world-wide as a viable alternative currency.  For me bitcoin is more about the societal changes than some 'get rich quick' pyramid scheme.
I would like every person in the world to be able to transact value to any other person in the world, without interference from the government and without the need of an intermediary.
In reality, it won't take a great deal for this to happen.  All that needs to happen is for general merchants start using bitcoin for transactions rather then what some big hedge fund manager is going to do with it.
Highly likely this will happen in China and other emerging markets.  Here in the US, we almost all already have debit/credit cards.  There are over a billion people elsewhere in the world who have no chance of ever getting either.

I didn't say I didn't have anything written down.  What I have written down, however, is a written clue to the password not the password itself.  
Let me give you an example...let's say that password is derived from some song lyrics.  What might be written down on paper is just the name of the song.  The password might be something like, say, every other word in the chorus, or something like that.  
So, anyone who found the written down part (name of a song) still would not have enough information for how to derive the password.  The only thing you, or your heirs, have to memorize is how to apply that clue.
You can create paper wallets with a small amount of bitcoin, share it with all of your heirs, and have them go through the entire process of recovering the password (using a different song of course).  You make sure they all know and have used the process.
Then, upon your death, in a safe deposit box, is the name of the song in question.  To a robber, this would not be sufficient information.  Only your designated heirs would know how to take that clue and derive the BIP-38 password.

I guess my answer to that is to have a line of credit.  Since my house is paid off I can have very large line of credit against it (about a 1/4 million dollars).
If I ever have a need for some 'cash' that I must have 'really quickly' then I can just dip into the line of credit.  Then, if it takes a week or two to sell some other investment that's no big deal.
At any rate, I was just responding literally to the OP meme which was probably meant as a joke.  In his meme he suggested that holding USD cash in excess of FDIC insurance was 'a problem', and I still believe that holding over $250,000 of USD in a checking account at a bank would be kind of absurd.  But, what do I know about the behavior of deca-millionaires.  Maybe they do keep a 1/4 million dollars worth of cash sitting in their checking account because 'they might need it quickly'.  I dunno, doesn't make sense to me.

Frankly, I gave them two whole bitcoin which were largely, in my mind, a donation.  At the time I thought they were a great company and that their Android wallet was absolutely the best.  The level of features in it are just amazing, and I still use it nearly every single day.
So, if I thought of it as a 'donation' in the first place, why am I pissed?  Well, because they had an obligation to continue to communicate with and engage the community.
I honestly thought they would make the Mycelium crowd-sale token available directly within their wallet (I mean it makes perfect sense) and that, perhaps, it might be something that could be traded on exchanges.
They had an obligation to communicate with the community, to follow up, and to at least not let the token itself simply die outright.
I just wrote the thing off as a loss on my taxes, so I've moved on from the point of view of a financial decision. It was a bad 'investment' and I can deal with that the same as I would any bad investment.  You move on.
That said, they have destroyed their reputation with the bitcoin community by executing a clear outright scam.
They didn't have an obligation that the token would  have some increased 'value', but they did have an obligation to make the token available, to create a market for it, and, most importantly, to communicate with the people who were now supposedly 'investors' in the wallet.
Instead, what we got, was silence, to be victims of a fairly transparent scam and, to add insult to injury, inflict ads on the very people who gave them money!  
How dare they release an ad version of their app without at least acknowledging the people who gave them money in the crowdsale!!??

Because the run up in price from $200 to $1,200 was based almost entirely on the perception that China, and it's people, were going to start using bitcoin in day to day commerce.

This is a great article, but it doesn't address one particular point that needs to be discussed.
Even though things like the Lightning Network are capable of offloading a huge number of payment transactions from the main bitcoin network, it still requires on-chain transaction pressure for end users to open and close payment channels, or rebalance those channels, over time.
First, it is important to note that this is **not** a short term problem.  In the short term, simply removing payment transactions from the main blockchain should free up a lot of on-chain capacity for new users to open and close channels.
However, there are real limits here as well. Eventually, there will not be enough on chain capacity to support the number of new users who wish to open and close payment channels.
Once again, this is not a short term problem, but it is a long term one.
Once this becomes the case, there are two ways to solve the problem.  First, we could raise the main bitcoin blocksize to accommodate more channel open/close requests.  However, as this article argues well, this may not be desirable.
The other solution would be to on-ramp new users via two-way-pegged sidechains (another piece of technology which does not yet exist).  A two-way-pegged sidechain functions essentially as a 'shard' of the main bitcoin blockchain.  It allows users to transact value which is 100% pegged to bitcoin on the main chain, safely and securely,  Another benefit of sidechains is that there can be many of them, each suited for particular markets, use cases, volume, security, and value.
One of the most remarkable aspects of the Lightning Network is that it can freely inter-operate across multiple sidechains at the same time, so long as they offer the same requisite cryptographic features as the bitcoin network provides. 
There is now a clear path forward to scale bitcoin to support every use case, every person in the world, and even every single device in the world, so long as we proceed carefully and are patient for these new layered technologies to come online.
Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, simply because we are hungry for a drumstick now!

A little note for Joe:
What's amusing about articles like this is how much it truly doesn't matter.  If, as the author states, bitcoins have no intrinsic value and are just a hyped up bubble then can he also, at the same time, publicly state that this imaginary funny money not be regulated or taxed?  I mean, you can't really have it both ways.  If it's all just funny money, like Monopoly money and World of Warcraft experience points, then by no means should the government be involved in regulating it or taxing it, right?
So, which is it?  Stupid, silly, bubble-mania funny money, or a real store of value that should be regulated by the government and subject to taxation?  You can't have it both ways.
If I had a one one hundredth of a bitcoin for every single news article written in the past four years proclaiming that bitcoin was either dead or pointless, well, I would be a very, very rich man.
But, in the end, I like articles like this one.  You guys just keep thinking that this whole bitcoin thing is a silly Tulip bubble.  You can just keep dismissing it with sarcasm and clown faces.  Please, please, please, keep doing that.
Because bitcoin is a Trojan horse operation for the world population to build their own economy independent of the existing banking system.  And, while you all sleep, in about five years you are going to wake up and find there is a vibrant world-wide economy running on a new world-reserve currency controlled by no banks, no governments, and, guess what, no one is going to even want government backed fiat currency any more at that point.
Maybe I shouldn't let the cat out of the bag?  Maybe I shouldn't tip our hand.  But, seriously, it doesn't matter.  Because you do not fundamentally 'get it', and you can keep not fundamentally getting it all of the way to the point that the old system dies the death in deserves.
Oh yeah, here is one more prediction for you.  This imaginary useless magical internet bubble money is going to bubble a whole lot more when the completely dysfunctional congress decides to try to shut the US government down yet once again in about six weeks.

Not really.  Over the past few months bitcoin has acted like a skittish colt bolting at the slightest whiff of a problem.
I think the community has matured and most everyone is now willing to be patient (for a while) to see if the market can grow and the currency/protocol become more widely accepted.
However if, tomorrow, the US government started arresting a bunch of people associated with bitcoin and throwing them in jail then I think things would change very quickly.
If you look at what happened to everyone involved in E-Gold type systems over the past few years, I don't see how unlikely it is for something like that to happen to people and businesses involved in bitcoin.
They could just issue guidance declaring bitcoin illegal, they then start confiscating a few checking accounts, and it doesn't take a lot to scare the peeps.

It's just not abnormal for bitcoin. The long extended period of relative stability was actually the most abnormal behavior we have seen historically.
Bitcoin can and will 'bubble' multiple times in its trajectory upwards. It has done so many times before and will continue to do so again.

@_date: 2013-10-22 18:24:59
Well, I've been on this ride for a while and what I have noticed is that there has been a certain amount of maturity with the people 'investing' in bitcoin.
Back then people were very panicky.  Everyone, including myself, had a deep fear that the price of bitcoin was going to plummet to virtually zero on the slightest bit of news.
At one point I sold 50btc at $89 because I decided I had exposed too much risk (i.e. invested more than I was willing to lose.)
Over time, as bitcoin has weathered various storms, more exchanges have come online, more businesses have adopted it, more governments have indicated they are at least going to allow it, people are becoming less and less afraid that it will be made illegal or otherwise plummet in value to zero.
Really, for most of us, that's been our big fear; that the value of bitcoin was most likely, over the long term, going to go very high or go to zero.  As the chance of it going to zero seems to lessen, then people no longer act as fearful about 'losing their entire stake'.
Over time the people involved in bitcoin have become battle hardened to the ups and downs of the markets and have really matured quite a bit.  They no longer seem to react irrationally to the weekend manipulations of whales playing around day-trading.  Also, some have been able to recoup their original investment and are much less fearful of 'losing it all' and therefore are much more willing to 'let it ride' for the long term. 
I think it crashed the last time because of fear but this time, when it crashes (corrects), I don't think it will crash very far.  It will continue to bubble for a long time to come, but every time it does fall in price there will be far too many buyers who are going to flood in to get cheap coin.

Would you put your entire life savings on a single bet at a blackjack table?
Bitcoin is extremely risky as an investment.
Consider this. If bitcoin is a major success it will have the following effect.
1 : right away will put western union out of business.
2 : put PayPal put of business
3 : put credit card companies out of business
4 : deeply cut into much of the business of banks
5 : devalue government currencies
It's that powerful a technology.
Now, what chance do you think there is that each of these things are going to happen without those being threatened putting up a fight?
And they can and will fight!
There are numerous potential threats to bitcoin that could reduce your entire investment to nearly zero.
The only positive I see right now is that the entire world is in absolutely no mood to listen to what the US government says.
Even if the US made bitcoin illegal or regulated it out of existence other countries might do just the opposite as a big fuck you.
You can actually envision a future where your bitcoins are illegal in the United States but you can use them to take a nice vacation in Europe.
Other countries are the only hope for bitcoin because it is far, far, far, too great a threat to existing corporations and governments to be ignored.
Bitcoin is an *extremely* risky investment and should best be thought of as a form of gambling. Think of it as a lottery ticket that pays off only if the existing power structure is overthrown.

An exchange is an account that will hold both USD and bitcoin and let you execute high speed trades based on orders.  You can also set up buy/sell orders, like 'If Bitcoin goes this high, sell this much' or vice versa, if 'Bitcoin drops below this value buy this much.' 
Coinbase is just a place you can buy or sell bitcoin through the existing banking system.  It does not let you place buy/sell orders, it does not hold USD in an account for you.

* I am making this top level post to explain some of the challenges, and promise, of the LN.
The LN works by having a certain amount of money 'on deposit' in the form of an open channel (a smart contract committed to the main bitcoin blockchain).
If we wish to keep the lightning network decentralized, and we certainly want to do that, then every single participant should have roughly 4 channels open on average at any given time.  If you have four channels open, then you become an active participant in a global decentralized mesh network; which would be ideal and awesome.
However, if you only have a single channel open, then the network will naturally configure to a hub-and-spoke model with great centralization in the hands of large liquidity providers.  I consider this to be a 'bad thing'.
In either case, you can only transact value as large as the size of the channel; meaning, if you open a channel with a $100 worth of value, the maximum amount of value that you can send or receive at any given time is $100.
This is great, and useful, and should accommodate lots of cups of coffee and true micro-transactions.
However, if you want to send and receive, say $1,000, you simply cannot.  The channel doesn't have the capacity.
If you wanted 100 million people to be able to participate in bitcoin via the lightning network, for example, there are a number of issues.
First, let's talk about the liquidity problem.
If we want the network to be truly decentralized, and to support up to $100 worth of value transfer over any node, that would mean 100 million people would need 4 channels apiece with $100 worth of value committed to each of the four channels.
100,000,000 X 4 X $100=$40,000,000,000
So, if we wanted a 100 million users to be able to participate in a fully decentralized mesh network with a maximum amount of value of just $100 would require 40 **billion** dollars to be committed to open channels.  That's pretty much the entire market cap of bitcoin.
However, if you wanted to allow for transfers of up to $5,000 per person, it becomes a different story entirely.
If you wanted a hundred million people to be able to transfer up to $5,000 apiece on a fully decentralized network, this would require 2 trillion dollars of bitcoin to be tied up for that purpose alone!
100,000,000 X 4 X $5,000=$2,000,000,000,000
You cannot have support for large amounts of value transfer in a decentralized fashion without an insane amount of capital being tied up.
If you are willing to accept a hub and spoke model, where the average number of channels per person is closer to one, it's still a ridiculous amount of money and, at that point, a very undesirable configuration for the network.
Things become even more complex when you realize that people will have wildly different sized channels open.  This will again create massive centralization pressure and also create a lot of on-chain pressure to constantly have to open and close channels as they remain unbalanced.
I can easily see how the LN is **THE** killer app for microtransactions.  I think this is a very big deal.  Not only will it move a lot of low-value petty transactions off of the main chain, a major win, it will also enable new forms of economic activity never possible before.
However, if anyone has any illusions that LN is somehow magically going to solve all scaling problems, they haven't thought things through.
Because...there's an even bigger problem.
If 100 million people wanted to participate in bitcoin and the lightning network, the average person would have to wait for **months** to even be able to open a channel!
The bitcoin network today supports approximately 300 thousand transactions per day.
For 100 million people to be able to open a **single** LN channel, would create a backlog of 333 days!!!
If we wanted the network to be decentralized, and everyone have 4 channels open, it would be a backlog that would take 1,332 days to clear!  Think about that.  For 100 million people to be able to perform just **four** on-chain transactions would lead to a 3.65 year backlog!!
Due to the fact that the LN requires on-chain transactions to open and close channels (per person!) and if you want it to be decentralized it needs even more, and if you want to take channel re-balancing into account (channel re-balancing means you have a channel open for $100 but if you want to send/receive more than a $100, you have to close the old channel and open a new one to do so).
If you think the backlog is bad now, wait till you see hundreds of millions of people, or even tens of millions of people, try to perform on-chain transactions on a semi-regular basis (required to be a participant in the LN).
However, don't despair.  There is a solution to the problem.  One of the most brilliant things about the lightning network is that it works **across multiple blockchains**.
Since the only thing the LN actually 'does' is exchange signatures, there is nothing to prevent it from exchanging signatures to contracts published on more than one blockchain at a time.  The LN allows for multiple blockchains to be 'hyper-linked' to one another.
And this is the magic sauce necessary to make everything actually work!
To on-ramp a 100 million or even a billion new users, that cannot happen directly on the main bitcoin blockchain.  However, it can happen across *hundreds* of sidechain networks!
To scale the bitcoin network to billions of users requires multiple layers in the form of:
* Bitcoin at the top (primarily used to peg value across sidechains)
* Sidechains for regular users who can open LN channels and to do larger value transactions.
* LN for all low-value transactions.
This is my vision for how bitcoin scales to every person on the planet, as well as every single machine.

Yeah, that's not much of a distinction.  Talk about splitting hairs.  Since *I* am the one that submitted the transaction then, clearly, that implies that *I* am the one being considered high risk. With no explanation why, either, by the way.  So, just what am I supposed to do?  Keep submitting buy orders indefinitely and keep getting them knocked down as 'high risk' with zero feedback as to what the issue is?  
I'm going to assume that constantly submitting buy orders that get kicked back as 'high risk' would, in turn, just keep marking me as 'high-risk'.
There is no feedback to indicate *why* it was considered high risk or what I can do to fix the problem.
Do you work for Coinbase?  I've already stated that this is as much of a communications problem as anything else.  They need to communicate better what the customer 'did wrong' and what they can do to fix it.

What if you buy gift cards, where technically, you are using the bitcoin as currency with a merchant. I find the fluid distinction between bitcoin as an investment and bitcoin as a currency to be very problematic.  By this logic every single time you buy something with a bitcoin (and the merchant converts it to dollar equivalent) you have realized a gain or a loss. How is anyone supposed to track that?

At the end if the day you are going to want to buy stuff. Today you really can't actually buy much with bitcoin.
Now, fast-forward a year or two when bitcoin is as commonly accepted as debit cards today, and things change.
You get your paycheck in fiat, convert all of your spending money into bitcoin right away. Then you just use it to buy things and it likely appreciates in the meantime.

I don't know if this is serious or a joke.  But, let me take is seriously for a moment.
* 'Trigger capital gains'?  If you are a bitcoin millionaire it's probably safe to assume these are bitcoin you bought well over a year ago.  That means it is subject to long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a much lower rate.
* Why would anyone convert their bitcoin to USD and then *hold* USD?  That's kind of insane.  You convert it to stocks, bonds, and other diversified investments.  Or, you buy a cool car, a house, a boat, pay off debt, or do something else useful with the money.  Holding USD  in a single account greater than FDIC insured limit would be idiotic.  Diversifying your portfolio is completely sane, reasonable, and rational. Or taking some profit and doing something life-changing with it as well.  But converting and holding USD in a bank account!??  That's absurd.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:44:02
Huh?  People have every reason to be suspicious of bitcoin wallet software installed onto their computer.  Do you read the news?  People are being ripped off left and right.  Now highly likely this is a perfectly safe and legitimate piece of software and the developers mean the best.

I just got your sample chapter and the first thing that jumped out at me was the phrase 'stored in your wallet'.  We are confusing the heck out of people by not making it clear that their wallet doesn't hold anything, their coins are stored in the bitcoin blockchain public database.  The only thing in your wallet is a private-key/security code and nothing more.
It's a semantic distinction but in the case of bitcoin a really important one.

FYI, the reason I bring this topic up is because I believe its the sleeping dragon of bitcoin and why I think there is a very good chance it will ultimately cause virtual currencies to simply made illegal in the US.
People keep acting like they have a handle on this bitcoin thing; its a commodity (like gold) and when you convert fiat to and from it then, at that point, the government can regulate the hell out of it. And that is already happening on all of the exchanges today; the ones that are still in business.
But the threat of bitcoin is not its use as a commodity but, rather its use as a currency.
They are regulating fiat to bitcoin and bitcoin to fiat but there is currently no discussion about regulating bitcoin to bitcoin transactions and, as we know with cryptocurrencies, by their very nature, that is simply not possible.  So the only thing the powers that be will be able to do is simply outlaw its use for legitimate business purposes. The recent absurd cease and desist letter from the State of California to the bitcoin foundation demonstrates exactly how it will be done.
The threat of bitcoin  to the powers that be are not its use as a commodity but, rather, its use as a currency.  Anyone who logically projects a successful bitcoin  currency into the future can for see a time when no one will even want or use fiat currency.
The fact that people in this thread already don't think they have to pay taxes on bitcoin purchases using appreciated assets demonstrates what I'm saying.
We don't do ourselves any favors by not talking about this stuff.
I've transfered $6,000 of my fiat to bitcoin and I can't wait to spend it in general commerce but, I'm afraid, there is every possibility that in a year its going to be outlawed and largely worthless.

If bitcoin is a ponzi scheme than so is gold.  The fact that you can hold a useless bar of gold in your hand hardly makes it any more tangible than a digital asset.  For bitcoin to be a ponzi scheme it would have to be useless.  It's not useless, therefore it's not a ponzi scheme.  It provides ever increasing value based on it's increasing adoption.
You people who criticize bitcoin sound just like the kind of people who's imagination could never even consider that email was a threat to physical mail, that online shopping was a threat to malls, or that online news outlets would be a threat to print media.

I think all they have to do is regulate it to death and essentially treat anyone who uses it, either as a business or an individual, a criminal.  That is already happening. They can't kill bitcoin itself but they can prevent it from being used as an effective currency for business transactions which is close enough.
When this happens, and its already happening, bitcoins will still exist but only used for underground black market purposes and be nearly worthless for practical use.
Just imagine regulators requiring that all transactions must be tied to a specific person, since that is impossible with bitcoin they will be essentially be outlawing bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-10-22 07:07:30
Well, first of all its a marketing gimmick.  You will get some modest attention by doing it. Second, really, the question to me amounts to asking, "Someone suggested I accept cash, do you think its a good idea?"
Bitcoin is just another way of accepting essentially cash payments. Why not accept it? Convert it to fiat immediately if bitcoin volatility worries you; though, quite frankly, bitcoin is probably worth a look a lot more than fiat in the long term.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:26:43
Bitcoin is essentially cash. Anyone who starts a sentence with the phrase "Should I accept bitcoin..." translates to "Should I accept irreversible cash..". Bitcoin acts like electronic cash and can convert to fiat (USD) immediately.
Its just another payment system like any other but with lower fees and lower risk and more immediate.

Here is my recommendation.  Let's say you have 100btc.  Generate *20* bitcoin wallet addresses/private keys.  Send 5btc to each.  Then, store that set of bitcion wallet address/keys into a text file stored onto a TrueCrypt encrypted file.  Use a very, very, high security password for the TrueCypt volume.
Now, mail that TrueCrypt volume file to as many cloud backup services as you want.  Google-Drive, USB sticks, email attachments, etc.
That's what I have done.

Newb? Been in bitcoin for over four years. The point of the post is to better understand that the big money has yet to seriously invest in bitcoin and if/when they do it will make the current bubble seen small.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:38:08
Yeah, since you are on Coinbase already, I recommend that you do these steps.
Step  : Go to  and generate a single wallet.  Copy the public/private key into a text file or something.
Step  : Send a tiny amount of bitcoin (a $1 worth or so) to this paper wallet from your Coinbase account (or some other wallet).
Step  : Go to  and enter the public key into the search box until you can see that the fundage is there and has been confirmed.  This may take a few minutes or longer, especially for a small amount like this.
Step  : Go to this link  and manually import your *private* key.  Copy/Paste.  This will 'sweep' the bitcoin from the paper wallet back into your coinbase account.  Once done the paper-wallet will be emptied.
Step  : (Optional) Sell the bitcoin so you get fiat back in your checking account.
Once this cycle is done the paper-wallet will be empty of bitcoin, you can throw it away.  There is no point/benefit in reusing it again.
To store *lots* of bitcoin, don't create one offline address.  Create many of them, and spread the bitcoin across it.
Let's say you had $10,000 in bitcoins.  Rather than storing all $10,000 onto one cold storage address, split it up with like $500 each in 20 of them.  Then, when you need fundage, you can just import it in increments of $500 at a time.
Here's some bitcoin to experiment with.  You can also just 'withdraw' from your Reddit wallet to a cold storage address if you prefer.
+0.01 btc verify
Another point, this exercise is just so you can learn the process.  If you want to do it for real, you need to concentrate on security of your cold-storage wallet.  That could be just physical security (locking a printout into a safe) or digital encryption processes.  Anyone who finds a copy of a printed out paper wallet, really anyone who gets a hold of the private key can, immediately, take/steal all the coins.  So, protecting/securing that paper wallet is super important.

True, but if it's your debit card, which can also be used as a credit card, its a nightmare.
I've had my credit card cloned about once a year for the past few years.
First, you gotta catch it right away and, second, you always feel violated.
Last year someone went on a spending spree in Vegas using my cloned card. I felt very violated knowing that someone was representing themselves as me and taking advantage of my good name. and credit.
Fyi, I think restaurants and bars are where your card gets cloned. In Europe the card never leaves your possession, they bring the machine to your table.
Here in the US the server walks off with it and they can "skim it" in a second.
Bitcoin at every restaurant, bar, and coffee shop can't come fast enough for me.

My understanding, and I'm only repeating what I was told by others, is that you have a choice.  You can either do first-in-first-out rule or last-in-first out.  I think you get to decide which of the two, but once you choose you have to be consistent.
So, you can either report your oldest bitcoin first when you do a sale, or your newest first.  The oldest first will show higher returns but get taxed at a lower rate if it's long-term gains.  The most recent first is more likely to show less gain but more short-term tax rate.
I always report most recent first.  So, the bitcoin I haven't sold yet are always 'the oldest'.
But, seriously, I'm not a tax accountant, best to ask one.

I do all the time and have.

There is no viable alternative for bitcoin if the power goes out everywhere.  When that happens the world will descend into a Max-Max thunderdome hellscape and loss of your magic internet money will be the least of your problems.

I agree with everything you have said here except I don't think any of it matters.  If it required new laws to be passed by congress, that would be one thing.  However, it didn't require any new laws to shut down 'Liberty Reserve' and most of the other e-gold networks.
All it require is for them to interpret and apply existing laws to bitcoin to have sufficient justification to shut it down.  All you have to do is accept that bitcoin is a currency, then it already violates a ton of existing laws.
So what if there is no centralized server or authority operating bitcoin in the US, no problem.  First, they will shut down all US based exchanges.  Then they will make it illegal to run a bitcoin client, to use bitcoins for commerce, and to buy and sell bitcoins.  They will start setting up 'sting' operations on localcoins and begin arresting people who try to buy and sell bitcoin person to person.
The United States is already, effectively, a police state. 
So, no, I do not think congress has to pass a single new law to shut it down in the US.  That won't kill bitcoin, though it will hurt it quite a bit, and I may have to travel to China on vacation to ever be able to enjoy the use of my bitcoins in the future.

It's in the title, so I thought people would get that.  I now have a nice down-payment on a car, I have recovered 100% of my initial investment, and still have 70btc left.
So, to 'witcoins' a big fuck-you.
I thought it was a good story to share, and if you think being able to invest, or sell, 16 grand makes you 'rich', you, know, really it's not.

I think you are correct.  I believe about 50% of the world's gold is actually used for something other than sitting in a vault.  I have a lovely gold ring on my finger right now that I quite like.  So, it definitely has intrinsic value as jewelry and for industrial uses.  Does that justify it's current valuation?  Probably not.
Most of the valuation of gold is based on it being used as a store of wealth.  People have confidence in gold because it has been used for thousands of years as a store of value.  It has not yet been hacked, meaning it seems to be a pretty finite resource and difficult to counterfeit.  There is no real expectation that the market is going to get flooded with a massive amount of brand new fresh gold all of the sudden.
However, even this has some technological risk.  There may, in fact, be relatively inexpensive nuclear processes which could transmute gold easily.  
Check this out for a pretty wild theory that might actually be real:
Then there is the notion that we could mine asteroids for gold.  
If gold was not, relatively speaking, scarce, it's value would plummet.
The fact that bitcoins are scarce and have all of these otherwise intentionally designed gold-like properties makes them very attractive as a store of wealth; that is if you can trust the network.
Someone on another thread yesterday made an amazing analogy that really rebuts a lot of the argument put forth as to why gold is better simply because it's something 'physical' with 'intrinsic value'.
For many years CD and records were a physical way to store music.  They had intrinsic value by virtue of having the music stored and embedded on each recording.
However, today, CD's and records are essentially worthless aside from some collectibles.  Well, really no one collects CD's seriously.  They have been replaced by an intangible digital representation of the information stored on them.  No one wan'ts a CD or record any more.  They prefer the digital form which can be easily stored and copied and has the highest fidelity of sound.
What bitcoin lacks right now is simply history.  It is young.  People are correct to be nervous that it is not a true store of value.  The network could collapse, it could be hacked, the developers could release an update to the software that, let's say, has a bug in it, and the entire valuation of the blockchain collapses.  It could just be a fad and everyone moves to something else, etc. etc.
However, if you fast forward about 10 years from now.  If bitcoin has, by then, a 15 year track record and an infrastructure which is orders of magnitude larger and more secure than today, then people will continue to gain confidence in it as a store of value.
If people become extremely confident in bitcoin then there is every chance it will cause gold prices to collapse or at least become greatly depressed in upcoming years.

So, let me understand this. A flood of new people decide to get into bitcoin. They come to reddit and ask for advice. We all tell them, "Go make an account on coinbase they are great." So they do. And they put in a buy order. And the funds clear their checking account. And then, after the funds clear, coinbase calls them high risk and cancels their order?
And you blame the new user who's only high risk behavior was creating a coinbase account like we told him too?

No offence but you sound like a knee-jerk critic who doesn't know anything about me.
First of all, I do not believe bitcoin can, will, or necessarily even should replace government issued currency.  I think it can and will live along side of it as a viable private currency operated by the people and for the people.
I do believe that bitcoin will nearly put Western Union out of business because it is so superior as a remittance system that it makes Western-Union look like the pony express in comparison.
I also believe that bitcoin will provide tremendous new opportunities in the third world and other countries where the general population lacks access to credit cards, checking accounts, and the ability to easily send and receive funds.
I certainly do not consider myself a nut-job libertarian.  I consider myself, at most, a 'social libertarian'.  I define a social libertarian as a guy who believes in both legal weed and fire departments.
This may surprise you to know, but I have a steady straight job for a major corporation.  I make good money, and I declare and pay every single penny of my taxes that state says I am supposed to.  I pay all of them and in all forms.  And I don't particularly complain about it either.
I am a member of the Lion's Club, the Freemasons, and the Shriner's.  I do a lot of charity work and try to be a contributing member of society and in my community.
All that said, I do *not* believe the US government has a right to violate my privacy!  I believe in the 4th amendment without any reservation.   We should not be spied on by our own government.  It is so offensive that it makes my skin crawl.  I am sickened by what our government is doing to violate the privacy of not only it's own citizens but the free people of the world.
I also do not believe it is the business of the government what I do with my own money.  Period. Whether I deposit or withdraw 10 dollars or 10,000 dollars, it's none of their fucking business.  If they suspect me of some crime, then they should get a warrant.
Our government is no longer representative.  It has been taken over by corporations.  The Patriot act was a vile subversion of the constitution of the United States and some people in government allowed themselves to be frightened enough to turn a once free nation into a police state.
Now, these are all simple statements of fact.  If you live in the United States and *like* the NSA reading all of your emails and private messages.  If you like the government inspecting every single financial transaction that you do, well good for you.
That represents no part of a free country I want to have anything to do with.

You don't have to at all.  There are plenty of people who store massive amounts of bitcoin in a single address.
I think it may just be personal preference to store bitcoin in multiple offline wallets.  For me it's so that if I want to bring some bitcoin out of cold storage, I can do it in smaller chunks.  I import a key with, say, just 5btc, rather than a single key with my entire stash.

Bitcoin is an extremely risky investment. Only invest money you can afford to lose. Today bitcoin value is mostly based on speculation and gambling which is, technically, the same thing.
It's most powerful practical use today is frictionless value transfer. I would not recommend taking a loan out to buy bitcoin any more than I would recommend borrowing money to play roulette.
On the other hand, if you want to gamble, then bitcoin is as much fun as poker.

I use bitcoin-qt, but I'm a software developer so I don't mind having the whole block chain on my machine. I'm also writing some block-chain analysis software too.
I use true-crypt and have multiple encrypted depots.  I have two (encrypted) wallets, both kept in encrypted drives. One wallet is used for 'cold-storage' and another for more day to day use as well as transferring to cold storage.
This is important, the only time I run the wallet client is on a freshly mounted encrypted drive. As soon as I'm done using it, I dismount the drive. And, of course, I have multiple backups.
This may not be perfect but I feel pretty secure. If I had a hard drive crash or even if a hacker had full access to my hard drive I wouldn't be concerned with double layers of encryption.

bitcoin is already regulated at the point where fiat is converted to bitcoin and back.  Direct bitcoin to bitcoin transactions are *not* regulated, nor can they be, nor should they be, nor will they be.
Over the past two days the issue at hand for the PTB was always about anonymity.  They want to remove anonymity entirely from the Internet.  Not just bitcoin, but everywhere in all places and in every way.
Good luck with that, I say.

Yes, I will, can, and have, spent a bunch of bitcoin already; just not at a physical retail location.  I've given out many tips, given away a bunch in general, I have made a lot of charitable donations, and I made online purchases like at the "Bee's Brothers" several times.
If you bought $10 worth of bitcoin thinking it's going to be worth a bazillion dollars some day and are hoarding it, that's just silly behavior.
If you buy $10 worth of bitcoin, then spend it, and then go buy $10 more.  
Am I going to spend the bulk of my bitcoin right now?  Probably not.  Am I going to buy bitcoin for day to day purchases and replenish it as needed?  Absolutely.

Your choice. I bought in steadily over a six month period at an average price of $120.  A week ago I sold 1/3 of my bitcoins to fully recoup my original investment and I still have the remaining 2/3 to let ride.
That said, those six months of holding were nerve wracking. And, even today, I face the decision of cashing out now or risking it all going to zero.

Sure that's possible. I just personally pick 10k as the 'dream oh my god its a huge success number'.
I think the 1k price is much more realistic as we can already see the value proposition for that alone in international remittance.
The big opportunities I see for bitcoin over the next few years are:
International transfer (I.e. putting Western Union out of business)
Online gambling (already happening now and should only get bigger).
Major game companies adopting bitcoin for in-game micro-transactions (I still think this is a major 'killer-app' for bitcoin)
Due to the 'network effect' the more value stored in the bitcoin system the more useful it becomes as well.
I would very much like to see more retailers using it, both online and physical, to supplant PayPal and credit cards, but that seems to be having a very slow adoption rate so far.

Its like you had Apple stock in 1980 and got rattled by day to day temper tantrums of Steve Jobs.

Bitcoin has only two long term prospects, its either going to be worthless or be like owning 1980 Apple stock.

@_date: 2013-11-07 22:05:21
I have been a Coinbase customer since February of 2013.  Since May I have bought and sold around 200btc via coinbase spread across probably 50 transactions.  I have almost only ever bought bitcoin, I have only sold 3 times.
I have been 'level 2 verified' for months, I have been eligible for instant purchase since they started it.  I have always had sufficient funds in my checking account at all times.  There has never been a single issue with that ever.
I have given them a valid Visa credit card with a $50,000 limit and authorized them to use it as a backup payment method for my instant purchases.
My personal credit rating is 805.
A few days ago I tried to make a 0.2btc purchase and it got flagged as 'high-risk'.  Don't know why.
Since then, my account shows, every time that I log in, that I am 'eligible for instant purchase', but if I try to do a purchase I immediately get a 'high-risk' email.  Now, if I"m high-risk why does it show that I can make an instant purchase?  The left-hand of the software doesn't know what the right-hand is doing.
So, there are a range of issues here.  This goes beyond just 'new users' trying to make their first buy.
Forgetting the conspiracy theories about how Coinbase is trying to cancel orders that would cause them to realize a loss due to the recent run-up, and giving them the benefit of the doubt, at the least they have a big PR problem right now.
They should stop calling long-time customers 'high-risk'; it's rude.  They should stop calling new customers who have gone through every verification check they ask for 'high-risk' as well.  It's rude and insulting.  They sure as heck should honor buy orders when the funds have been taken out of the sellers account.
At the minimum, I think they need to change how they are communicating with their customers.
I filed a support ticket for myself.  No answer yet. 
I'm willing to give them a ton of benefit of the doubt.  They are probably getting swamped with tens of thousands of new accounts and orders that they may or may not be able to fulfill.  Their website might be getting more overwhelmed than the Obmacare site right now.
However, none of that excuses the rude emails and poor communications with customers, especially because that is the easy thing to do right.
I also cannot understand the bizarre troll like behavior in these forums the past few days as people have been reporting their legitimate experiences and concerns.  The vile attacks and foul language of these troll responses are entirely unhelpful.
They go way beyond just Coinbase fan-boy behavior.  I consider myself a Coinbase fan-boy.  I've been singing their praises and promoting them since day one.  However, clearly they are having some growing pains and they need to communicate better with their customer base or suffer a lot of bad PR during this important time in the evolution of the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:22:06
Yeah, none of those things.  At this point I'm uncertain if I will ever be able to buy on coinbase again.  I guess it's localcoins for me.  That should be adventurous.  I use 2FA, have been a customer for 8 months, have credit card backup, not sure what's high risk about a guy with an 805 credit rating and a long time customer.
Also, you are slicing things pretty thin saying the 'transaction' is high risk and not the customer.  To the customer, who has no clue 'what he did wrong', that distinction is not very obvious.
@_date: 2013-10-09 20:10:17
My recommendation is that you create a 'paper' wallet, essentially this is just a printout of a public/private key pair.  Send the bitcoins to this wallet by just using the public key address.  You can use the blockchain info website to confirm that it's all working, send a small test amount of coin just to be sure.
Now, how to protect your paper wallet?  One thing I have done is save the paper wallet to a digital file (JPEG, PDF) and then copy that to a USB.  Now, you have both physical paper and a physical digital copy.  Put those in a safe.
From time to time, send new coins.
There is some risk here.  You could be robbed and if someone robbed you and got your paper wallet or USB copy, they would be able to steal your coins.
That's really the main risk.  But, there is no risk of someone hacking your computer, etc. if you use this technique.
An intermediate solution is that your paper wallet is actually based on some kind of encryption.  So, to use it, you would have to scan it in and then enter a password to get the actual private key.  This way even if someone finds your paper wallet printout that, alone, isn't enough to give them the key.  They would still need the password.
Another approach is to create a 'Brain Wallet'.  This means to create a public/private key based on something you have memorized.  This is somewhat problematic because a good bitcoin brain-wallet should be based on a very, very, long stream of fairly random values.  And, of course, that could be very hard to remember.
The approach here is that you use the memorized brain wallet password to, in turn, produce a public/private key pair.  There are tools that let you do this.
One idea I recently had for a way to create a good quality brain wallet that you could also easily remember would be to pick a book, then select some range of pages and then some other criteria.
For example, it could be the third word of the second paragraph of every other page for pages 50-75.
You get the idea.  You could make up any set of rules for yourself and then the only thing you would have to remember is the name of the book and this selection criteria.  
This is getting kind of over-kill though.  You would probably only do something so over the top if you were trying to hide a vast fortune from the FBI.
But, with this approach, you would just use this brain-wallet as a place to store bitcoins for a long-term investment.  To actually spend them you would need to pull out a copy of the book and manually re-create the private key.  This would be rather time-consuming.  However, it would be extremely safe.  Short of someone sticking a gun to your head and demanding the key, no one is ever going to confiscate your coins.

That sounds nice but it doesn't match reality.  There are already several high quality bitcoin apps written and ready to go for IOS; versions that have been running on Android for a long time, including the Coinbase app which they originally approved and then removed not for technical reasons, but rather for political ones.
Let's not play games here, this has nothing to do with the 'quality' of these bitcoin apps, it has to do with Apple wanting to control how payment processing works via their ecosystem.
Don't get me wrong, I get it.  It's their system, they have the right to do this.  However, I would also advise people to make a choice to *not* use their system in favor of one which is open.  I made that choice and that's my advice to others.
You can play in Apple's walled garden, or, you can grow up and go out into the world of open development with you big boy pants on.

Layers of protection can be built on top of bitcoin, and surely will, but bitcoin has already built a massive worldwide network that requires no central bank or third party. Many other digital currencies will spring up, but I doubt much value will be placed in them.

That is incorrect. You have to pay taxes on a realized gain when you make a purchase. Its easy to understand if you look at it this way. 
Let's say I pay ten grand for some bitcoin  and then it triples in value. Now I sell that bitcoin for thirty grand to buy a $30,000 dollar car. But, wait, I have to pay taxes on the twenty grand profit so now I don't have enough money to buy the car.
But, you are claiming I can avoid paying taxes if I find a dealer who will just sell me the car for 30 grand worth of bitcoin directly.
You can't avoid paying taxes that way, I'm pretty sure that is against the law.

Oh, OK, sorry I misunderstood. But I'm telling you this is a big problem with bitcoin so long as it is simultaneously used as both a commodity and a currency at the same time.

And, if bitcoin succeeds long term, it will always appreciate relative to fiat.

Ah, never mind.  The order must have gone through as I got a confirmation email.  One thing BitPay can improve is giving you better feedback on that payment step.
I'll leave the post up if anyone else finds the information useful.
The conclusion of this appears to be that:
If the BitPay payment page times out, and says the order is cancelled, but your transaction still goes through and is confirmed then, apparently, your order is still processed.

Its only a gain when you convert back to fiat.
@_date: 2013-06-08 23:51:59
I'm curious, do you think it's more than 10% or less than 10% chance it's going to be worthless?  My skepticism stems from the fact that I think I understand just how major a threat bitcoin (or cyrpocurrency in general) is to the powers-that-be.
By threat, I mean a threat to collecting taxes, a threat to tracking and monitoring activity, etc. and, mostly, a threat to the banking system and their ability to print money out of thin air.
If bitcoin is allowed to continue, the natural progression is that a few years down the road *no one* is going to even want fiat currency any more.
Right now, today, all of the regulation centers around the point where cryptocurrency is converted to fiat and back.  This is largely because you still need fiat currency to buy most goods and services.
However, if you can buy goods and services, pretty much anywhere, using bitcoin, then why, why, would anyone use fiat any more?
Fiat is inherently inflationary.  Bitcoin is inherently deflationary.  It only increases in value over time so long as it is what people use for buying goods and services.
At that point, nobody is going to even want shitty fiat money any more.
That is the *real* threat of cryptocurrency and, do you really, honestly, think 'they' are going to let that happen?
'They' will simply make it illegal to do business with cryptocurrency.
It will still live on in the underground world, but you wont' be able to use it on Ebay, you won't be able to use it at Amazon.com, you won't be able to use it a grocery store or gas station or restaurant.
All 'they' have to do is pass a law saying so.
And, why would 'they' do that?
For the same reason 'they' gave trillions of dollars of bailout money to the banks but shafted the consumer.  'They' are the same people who shove laws into bills making it illegal to sue particular corporations (like Monsanto).  'They' pass laws which completely revoke almost all of our civil liberties and due process.
Look at the big shocking revelations about the NSA in the main-stream media these past two days.  This is *old* news, and was heavily discussed in 'conspiracy' circles for over a decade.
But now, suddenly, it's news?  Our congress passed these laws which revoke our civil liberties, due process, free speech rights, again and again and again.
They quite literally are no longer a representative government of the people, by the people, or for the people.  The represent only corporations and banking interests.
These are obvious and clear facts.
So this is why I think there is less than a 10% chance cryptocurrency will not simply be outlawed.
All they have to do is pass a law that says you will be fined or go to jail for using cryptocurrency.   Or, they will pay lip service and say that cryptocurrency is just fine..only so long as you follow a massive giant pile of regulations which, if you don't follow (and it will be impossible to do so) you will go to jail.
They will demonize cryptocurrency, and it's users, as a bunch of mafia drug pushers, tax dodgers, and criminals.
I would like to know how you, or anyone, doesn't think this is the likely long term outcome?
The only ray of hope I see, if is large countries embrace it (perhaps china and some European nations) and the US can't shut it down because you can't be seen as the 'free country' by denying your citizens access to technology available to everyone else in the world.  Maybe, just maybe, that's the only hope.
Otherwise, in a year or so, the only thing I will be able to buy with bitcoin is drugs and other illegal services in the underground.
That's my thinking on it.
How do you get above 10%, or were you, perhaps, thinking even less?

I can sell but not buy. I submitted a support request which is probably sitting in a queue with 50,000 others.
My theory is they have a risk detection algorithm which is very conservative and fires off a bunch of false positives.
Most of the problem here is messaging.
They should not refer to long time established customers as "high risk", that's just rude. Use different language.
And don't keep showing on your account "you can instant buy X btc" only to have it *rejected* when you try to purchase.
They aren't going to fix their filtering issues overnight, but they sure as hell can change the tone of their messages!

When email was invented and some guy said that it would some day replace most regular mail and put the post office in near bankruptcy what did you call it!? Oh yeah, hype.
When the internet came along and some guy said it would be the death of print media? Oh yeah, hype.
When people said billions of dollars would be spent on online shopping killing many shopping malls? Oh yeah, hype.
You lack vision and imagination. 
There is over 8 trillion dollars invested in the world in gold which has almost no intrinsic value. You can't buy things with it. It's just a hunk of largely useless metal.
I can use bitcoin already to buy things online in thousands of locations but no store will accept gold shavings and I can't insert it into my network connection.
The fact that people have stored 8 trillion dollars into gold is a powerful testament to how many people desperately do *not* want inflationary fiat currency.
No one is forcing you to use bitcoin, but to lack the vision to see that it could, in fact, become gold 2.0 is short sighted.
The first time you send someone money, around the world, instantaneously, without fees, and without an intermediary, you will catch your first glimpse of just how revolutionary this technology is.

Sure, but if it went to $1,700 would it drop below $200?  Probably not and, frankly, so long as it doesn't drop below $100 I'm still ahead of the game.  It's going to bubble, no question about that, but I don't think it's very likely going to go down to zero.

It *is* a bubble. One which will inflate and pop dozens and dozens of times for quite a while until certain stabilizing forces come into play.
You people trying to measure bitcoin based on what happens over the course of a day, a week, a month, have no perspective.
Bitcoin is in its infancy. There are no mature trading platforms. There is limited liquidity.
The success of bitcoin is going to be measured in years. No one has ever bought bitcoin, held it for six months and shown a loss; even if it bubbled and popped 10 times in between.
Bitcoin might fail; for a wide range of reasons, but that failure will not be based on market gyrations as much as it will be mainstream adoption and better infrastructure.
Circle *just* received 9 million in funding. Let's give them a year. A new exchange *just* got 5 million in funding; let's give them six months.
Show a little patience people.
If you believe in bitcoin then buy some and hold it for two years; also buy some and spend it.
People here keep claiming no one will spend their bitcoin because its too precious. This is nonsense.
If Starbucks accepted bitcoin most of the people on this forum would start using their cell phone wallets there immediately and often.
Don't measure bitcoin unless you use a log scale and, if you do, things look on track.

I am manually entering the data. So far I have only bought bitcoin, never sold. I consider myself a long term investor and I want to wait at least one year before I sell anything so that I only get taxed on capital gains.
What concerns me, and I have brought this up before, is that when I spend bitcoin to buy goods and services then, at that time, I will have realized a capital gain or loss.
I don't think hardly anyone is prepared to deal with the ramifications of that.
I brought this up before in a previous thread and it was amazing how many people didn't think they had a tax liability if they only used their bitcoin  to make purchases.

Bitcoin is a very risky 'investment'. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Today it is mostly speculation , though the technology shows great promise.
There is no point in mining bitcoin. Buy some, spend some, hold some. Don't invest any money that would cause you heartache if you lost it all.
Bitcoin could easily be made essentially illegal in the US on short notice causing the value to plummet.

It comes from people who have no sense of perspective about how the bitcoin market operates.  It's still a small market with a really unprofessional patchwork of exchanges which supposedly drive the price.
It's pretty basic.  Every time there is a rapid run-up in price, each time, it hits some level that previous buyers decide to 'cash out' to reap profit.  This is completely natural and expected human behavior.
Then, when those people cashing out put in big sell orders, the price plummets and all the newbies who 'just got in' show their weak hands and sell, sell, sell.
This cycle has been going on for years now.
Every single person who has simply bought and held bitcoin for over six months has made a huge profit.
A number of people in the community have gotten wise to this pattern and are no longer so easily manipulated.
However, in the past few weeks, we have had a giant influx of 'newbies' who replay this emotional pattern out over and over again.
It's no mystery to me, or anyone who's been watching bitcoin for a long time, why we see this endless series of bubbles occur.  Bitcoin will continue to bubble for a very long time, until it reaches a level that cannot be so easily manipulated and has more mature trading platforms.
The mystery here is really the business media which keep writing these 'bitcoin is dead' stories every 48 hours.  You would think they would have the knowledge and maturity to understand that this bubble behavior is a natural artifact of this new commodity 'filling up'.
It's behaved this way for years, and will keep acting like this for years more.
If you bought bitcoins at $900 a day ago, then just wait six months.  If you are still showing a loss, then I will be surprised.  
For what it's worth, I sold a large chunk of my bitcoin investment one week ago at $325 because, at the time, that price seemed obscenely high and represented a huge return on my original investment.  To me the prices today are not 'down', they are still crazy high.  
We need some perspective around here....

Well, let me answer you specific question.
I believe there is about a 10% chance that bitcoin is a good investment over the long term.
I think there is a 90% chance that your $1,000 will be virtually worthless in a year.
The upside, however, is quite large. If, and that's a big if, bitcoin becomes an accepted mainstream currency, then you could probably see a massive return on your $1,000 investment.
Ask different people, and you will get different percentages, but I think everyone agrees that the risk-reward proposition is of that magnitude.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:33:09
Here, here. Well said.  This is absurd to me, and not just the reaction of this forum but also the reaction of the financial press which ought to know better.
Bitcoin shot up in value based on the expectation/belief/hope that China was going to have widespread adoption.  Now that this appears to not be the case, the value is correcting to whatever the market feels make sense with China out of the picture.
It's still up crazy high not only for the year, but for the past two months.

As someone who has been watching this for a while, this whole process appears to be a cycle of re-education.  Every time there is a crash, it's because a bunch of new investors came in and they recycle the same fear-uncertainty-doubt process that we have seen play out over and over again.
Each time the weak hands are flushed out and what remains is a larger population who has matured enough to understand to not be so easily spooked by these flash-crash market corrections.
I expect this to happen again and again at multiple price levels, simply because it has happened again and again in the past.
The volatility isn't going away any time soon until we have much broader adoption, better trading platforms, and some other changes to the overall nature of how this commodity is bought and sold.
As I tried to say yesterday, if you are (A) risking money that you would get emotional about losing then you are doing it wrong and (B) if you are investing because you believe in bitcoin, then let it's run its course, which is measured not in days, or months, but in years.

In answer to your first question, yes those bitcoins are forever lost.  For this reason the total number of available bitcoins is potentially much smaller than the amount which have been mined to date.
Some people don't see this as an issue, because bitcoin is infinitely divisible but, on the other hand, it does create some uncertainty since it's impossible to tell the difference between lost coins versus simply hoarded ones.
The actual total number of lost coins could be quite large but, even more scary, are the millions of hoarded coins which could wreak havoc on the market if they were dumped all at once.
Regarding your second question. If the internet went out we would all be fucked anyway. Most everyone's money is already digital and would be affected just the same by an internet outage.

LE has a good chance of accessing these bitcoins since they have full access to the servers and source code.  Depending on how DPR implemented the system, it's quite possible they could get at them. It probably boils down to this question, could DPR have ever accessed them himself?  If so, then there is a chance.  But, if he wrote a system such that even himself, as system administrator, could not access the funds in individual users wallets, then no. They are gone in either case as far as all users are concerned.

You are worrying about the wrong things. As others have pointed out, the supply of bitcoin isn't the issue.
There are some technological and political issues which are a much greater threat.
On the technology side bitcoin isn't even anywhere close to being able to handle transactions on a global scale; say comparable to credit and debit cards.
The political pressure is the bigger threat. Bitcoin and bitcoin users are called criminals, drug addicts, tax dodgers, money launderers, and even child pornographers.
Because bitcoin is a direct threat to a number of major businesses as well as a threat to governments, the chances of it being demonized, outlawed, or regulated out of existence are very high.
You are worrying about the wrong problem.

One myth I would like to correct is this myth about Coinbase.  Coinbase is no more difficult to connect to your checking account than PayPal is.  In fact, it's essentially the identical process.  Now, it is probably reasonable for people to feel nervous about dealing with some new company like Coinbase, versus PayPal which has been around for a long time.  However, when PayPal first started people felt the same way.
As far as the delays in verification, etc. people need to show some patience. If you want some bitcoin *now*, like, really, really, really *now* then just buy some from somebody who has some in person.  
However, so long as you have to connect to the current banking system there are going to be delays and verification involved.  The point at which bitcoin converts to the existing banking system is the point at which government regulators wish to intervene.
Most of us have no problem with this, that's just part of the current growing pains.
In a hypothetical future where you can buy and sell things pretty much anywhere with bitcoin, we may reach a point where people show less and less interest in bothering to convert to fiat at all.  This is the libertarian wet-dream scenario of the future.
Obviously that's not here today, and obviously it may never happen but, to be clear, that's what we are all hoping for some day.
In the meantime, yeah, friction will occur where bitcoin meets the existing banking system.

I'm more worried about China setting a precedent that other countries will follow than anything else.  These repeated reports of banks shutting down accounts which use bitcoin exchanges is really disturbing.  Pretty soon you will only be able to buy and sell bitcoins in person, like you were dealing weed or something.  The 3rd world countries can still save bitcoin, but if the banks keep fighting this it's going to be a rough few months going forward.

Just last night I taught my wife how to use TrueCrypt to access our encrypted vault, how to check the balance of one of our 20 different bitcoin cold storage addresses, how to use blockchain.info to check the balance, how to log into our coinbase account with 2FA, how to import a private key and, finally, how to sell the imported bitcoin so it shows up in our checking account as fiat.
She took notes and remarked many times how complicated it was. I explained it was only this complicated because I am trying to keep them very secure (they could have just already been in the Coinbase account for example.)
I also explained that in the future the Coinbase account might change, or she might not be able to log in, so she would have to seek alternatives.

The point of my post was a personal anecdote about how useless gold is. I can't buy anything with it. Its extremely difficult and time consuming to convert to and from fiat.
My personal experience is that bitcoin does a better job of exposing the weaknesses of gold than anything else.

Good point. In the hypothetical scenario proposed, I just wouldn't want to disturb the market as much as redistribute wealth.

I guess no one else thinks about social consequences of extreme wealth disparity.
For me, unless bitcoin is used (and I mean *used* not hoarded) by a billion people I will consider it an abject failure.

Well, first you have to define 'filthy rich'.  I don't think one million qualifies, though it would certainly be a nice chunk of change you could have fun with.  Truly 'filthy rich' probably means never having to work another day for the rest of your life and live a pretty nice lifestyle, in which case maybe something like 20-40 million would fit my definition of 'filthy' rich.
Now, if you are going to extrapolate a realistic increase in value for bitcoin, I think $1,000 US per BTC is probably not that crazy if it continues to grow over the next year or two.  That is going to be a big jump, probably providing a 10x power boost for people who dollar averaged around $100 per btc.
If you want to be super optimistic about bitcoin future valuation, then 10k per bitcoin is probably a really nice pie in the sky dream amount.  One cool thing about that kind of valuation, is that if bitcoins are worth 10k per, then chances are by that time you won't have to cash out to fiat any more to buy pretty much anything you want in life.  
I know there are some people who have even more crazy optimistic projection but I think we have a long road to $1,000 per and the $10,000 per is wildly optimistic.
So, to be 'filthy rich' which I will define at $20 million dollars US equivalent, how much bitcoin do you need?
With the optimistic but not completely impossible valuation of $1,000 / btc you need 20,000 bitcoins to be 'filthy rich'
If the valuation is $10,000 per bitcoin (which is wildly optimistic and in my mind would represent the complete and total world-wide acceptance and adoption of bitcoin at a wide scale), then you only need 2,000 btc to be filthy rich.
Personally, I own 110 bitcoins, so I'm happy to just be a little bit filthy.

I sent a few tips, got a message indicating insufficient funds in my Coinbase wallet, so I logged into my account and did an instant purchase of 0.8 btc so I would have funds to cover the tips.
A minute later I got an email from Coinbase stating the instant purchase was canceled because it was 'high risk' and stated try again in a few weeks. 
I have, in the past, purchased about 200btc from Coinbase usually about 10btc at a time so, clearly, just using the tip-bot to send a bunch of small transactions triggered this alert.

Here's my perspective.  I predict that, in one to two years, your bitcoins will be almost 100% for sure worth more than $200; or they will be worth virtually nothing because they will be made illegal and are about as useful for general commerce as Warcraft gold points.  It's one way or the other.  If you accepted the risk of bitcoin to begin with, then just keep buying with whatever money you can afford to completely lose, at whatever price, and wait.  Oh yeah, and if it's ever worth more than what you paid, use it to buy shit.

Thanks for the tip.  For what it's worth, I personally own a little over 70btc purchased at an average price of $110 apiece.  So, it's not like I don't have skin in the game.  But, you gotta admit that much of the time this whole thing seems like a giant hype machine.
In fact, when you begin to extrapolate btc out to some future 'mainstream' scenario, it looks more and more like a pyramid scheme which is fueled entirely on hype.  Those who got in early get rich, those how get in late deal with a 'currency' that is extremely risky, easy to lose, poorly accepted, and volatile as hell.
I'm sure there are plenty of people sitting on 100+ btc that they bought at a fraction of the price I did and consider me a sucker.  People don't like to be thought of as suckers, and buying in at these higher prices just makes a bunch of early adopters rich.
I don't think it's an unrealistic scenario to suppose that this hype machine is going to collapse in the next two years and bitcoin never takes off in any big way.

Well, I have no idea what criteria their algorithm uses to flag a transaction as 'high risk'.  I think the email should explain *what* it thought was high-risk (whatever that criteria is) and, more importantly, explain what the user can do to correct it.  The let the user, by providing whatever additional verification is necessary (for example like resetting the 2FA so they have to re-enter it) then, at that point, their software can go, "Oh, yeah, you are the right guy." and go ahead and approve the transaction.
The email doesn't give any clue as to 'why' the transaction is considered high-risk (a) and (b) does not give a path to resolve it.  This 'try again later' thing is fairly dismissive in tone.  Also, since some overly sensitive people like me take the phrase 'high-risk transaction' kind of personally the email can use phrases like 'valued customer' and the like.

Hey Matt, love that you are doing this story and all.  One of the biggest problems you are having is because you are using an Iphone.

Could I ask you to *please* take some of that money and buy and Android phone or a tablet?

It's kind of interesting; I think I heard it said that the Winklevoss Twins own something like 1% of bitcoins.  However, that may not be the case.  There is a general belief that something like 70% of the bitcoins ever created are irrevocably lost; because people had them years ago, when they were worthless, and have long since lost the private keys.
If that's true, they probably own a lot more than 1%.

Yes it is a bubble. One which will inflate and collapse dozens of times over the next few years. Likely each time it will always end up higher than where it started, as has proven true since its inception.
It could collapse to near zero. It is still considered a risky investment.
However, if it succeeds and becomes a major worldwide payment system, then it will likely stabilize and the bubbles will be less extreme.
You should consider it a high risk investment with the possibility of a very high return. Only invest what you are willing to lose.
Personal story, I invested 16k between May and November and watched that original investment nearly triple in value.
Last Friday I got my original investment back out and I'm letting the rest ride with zero risk.

What we are trying to distinguish here are total coins which have been lost/destroyed from those which are just being hoarded.  While we can never get an exact answer to this question we can, over time, come to some good estimates within a certain statistical range.
Here's what people often forget.  Simply moving any bitcoins at all, even if it's one Satoshi, proves that all bitcoins held at that address are *not* dead/lost.  It proves that the owner is exercising control.
For the purposes of this discussion, we know that the vast bulk of dead/lost coins predate the big run-up of 2013.  Sure, there are still coins being lost today, but that's a different nut to crack.
Can we figure out how many coins prior to a certain point in time, say January 2013, are 'dead'?  I think we can make an educated guess.
One important point here is that the community has learned a great deal about wallet security over the past year.  If you were holding coins prior to 2013, you are quite likely to have at least moved them by now to a more secure location.   Perhaps you transferred them to cold storage, or moved them to a new piece of wallet software, or something else.  If coins are sitting in an address from which not a single Satoshi has moved in years, well, we can certainly classify that as 'likely dead'.
Every single day someone makes a transaction from an address which has remained untouched since, let's say, prior to January 2013. We can track this movement, day by day, week by week, month by month.  And, over time, we should be able to make some statistically significant predictions about when, how often, and in what size old coins come back to life.
The ones which have never moved, not even a single Satoshi, since prior to January of 2013 have a certain probability of being lost/dead, and we should be able, as time goes on, to predict more accurately how many that comes to.
Again, I can't reiterate this enough.  If you have a bitcoin address which holds say 1,000 coins that hasn't moved for 4 years and, tomorrow, you move 0.00000001btc, then that marks *all* 1,000btc as 'alive', by virtue of the owner having declared himself alive and and in control of that address.

The news sounded good at first.  China did say that people can still buy and sell bitcoins.  And it was unclear if that implied they could or could not use it to buy and sell goods and services.  I asked this a bunch of times yesterday and everyone said that the ruling did not mean that.
In fact, I'm not sure it does mean that.  But the Chinese people are rightfully paranoid ( so I think at this point they are trying to be better safe than sorry.

My personal preference is to store 'saved' coins into an offline wallet.
You can go to this address: 
Use it to generate a 'wallet'.  Then save that off to an encrypted USB.  You can 'send' all the coins you want to the *public* address.  Keep the private address safe.  If, down the road, you need access to those coins you can 'import' the private key and sweep the funds.

Ask yourself why there is 8 trillion dollars hibernating in gold, and then you will have your answer. The general populace is sick of seeing their currency devalued by a never ending printing press. There is no greater ponzi scheme in the world than the Fed printing presses.  First they tried gold as a store of value, but it's kind of hard to transport and spend. Bitcoin operates and behaves similarly to gold, but is extremely easy to use as a payment system as well.
The reason it has shot up in value is that it represents the pent up desire of the masses to find some place, any place, to store value that can't be manipulated and controlled by a government with a printing press.
There is no need to make this more complicated than it is.

I am planning on writing a computer program to provide an estimate of this based on statistical analysis. The bitcoin days destroyed thing doesn't cut it.  What you need to distinguish is live or dead wallets, not live or dead coins.  If somebody has a wallet with 500btc and they spend 0.001 out of it then that means that all 500btc are 'alive' since the person who controls them just demonstrated that fact.
Using some statistical methods we should be able to come up with a reasonable estimate which can be refined over time comparing actual wallets rising from the dead.
Of course, it can never be perfect, but it can be a reasonable approximation.

You can 'import' your public/private key using this website: 
Once it's imported you can spend the coins.  Import by doing a copy/paste or manually typing in the whole key.
Step  : Create a 'wallet' at that website
Step  : Select 'import' private key
Step  : Buy 'Bees Brother's honey products.

Go to bitcoinaddress.com, download their paper wallet generator. Disconnect your machine from the internet.  Generate a public/private key pair (i.e. a wallet). 
Send your bitcoin from coinbase to that paper wallet public key address.
If you want to do the full secure route. Download and install TrueCrypt. Create a small 1mb encrypted volume. Pick a good password that you can remember; don't write it down anywhere. Copy your public/private key cold storage address to that encrypted volume as a text file and/or image.
Next, unmount the volume and reconnect to the internet. Now copy that file in a bunch of places. USB and cloud storage. As long as your TrueCrypt password is strong you are safe. 
Over time, as you get more bitcoins, you can send them to that address.

The bitcoin network automatically adjusts  based on how much computing power it needs to produce blocks at a fixed rate. The point being that it does not "need" that much computing power. It would run just fine with a tiny fraction of the current level.

Why do women want diamonds and not cubic zirconium?
Your premise is already true today. Bitcoin is open source. All you have to do is make a copy of the source, call it butcoin  instead of bitcoin and start it running.
Guess what, even though butcoin will be identical technically in every way to bitcoin no one will use it.
That is because the value inherent in bitcoin is in the blockchain itself. People want an entry in that blockchain and not some other database.
The underlying technology for bitcoin could (and can) change dramatically over time and just so long as the blockchain transaction history remains intact and inviolate then it remains the true arbiter of value.
Nobody wants a 'knock-off' they just want the 'real thing'.

I lost zero dollars and zero cents. I'm still at over 50k profit on paper with zero at risk. I am in bitcoin for the long term.
And, quite frankly, no one lost a penny today unless they sold!
In one year bitcoin will either be worth substantially higher than its current all time high or it will be worth nothing.
It's a risky investment, if you heard otherwise, someone was lying to you.
Less then two months ago I sold 50btc to recover my original investment when the price reached an absurd high of $325; three times more than I bought in at.
Now its still nearly twice that and you people think its anything other than a short term price correction!?
This is all just noise. Wait a year and then tell me how you lost your money. Anyone weak enough to sell at a loss now should never have gotten in in the first place.
You may lose all your money but you won't lose a penny unless you are foolish enough to sell now!
Bitcoin is a worldwide economic, social, and political experiment. It may succeed or may fail, but that will be determined over the courses of years.

No, no, no...you are missing the point.  If the power goes out you can't *get* any cash; only whatever you happened to have in your wallet at the time.  I do a lot of charity work where we raise funds and I can testify that fewer and fewer people carry any cash on them any more.
So, if the power goes out, you only have whatever cash is in your pocket.  You can't use your credit cards, or your debit cards, or your bitcoin either. It's the same either way.
Now, if you want to be really paranoid about a power outage, then you should stock up on cash, silver, gold, and cans of soup.
However, bitcoin itself is at no particular disadvantage over existing forms of digital payments in the event of a catastrophe.
The bottom line is that most people have very little cash 'on them' before the lights go out.

My hopeful side likes to think that for them to "do something" about bitcoin would require the congress do "do something" and they have repeatedly proven that they are incapable of doing anything.
Just today a friend forwarded to me a tea-party email blathering on about not letting the gummint take their bitcoin.
The current congress is so woefully inept and dysfunctional you gotta wonder how they could manage to pass any law of any kind.
I suppose the real fear is what they can do without actually passing a law at all.
There are going to be some very interesting philosophical and legal questions if they do though, because laws affecting bitcoin would have to also apply to all crypto-currencies, frequent flyer miles, bonus points, video game virtual gold, and barter systems.
The myth of gummint money is falling.

bitcoins have already succeeded.  This epiphany came to me when I realized that the fundamental usefulness inherent in bitcoin is in its ability to transfer value.  Ultimately it does not matter all that much what an individual bitcoin is worth; simply that it is worth 'something'.
So long as it's 'worth something' then you can use it as a conduit of value around the world for seamless transactions.  It doesn't even matter if the value of an individual bitcoin is particularly volatile or not; just so long as the value is stable enough for the duration of a particular transaction.
Convert fiat to bitcoin at one end, send it anywhere in the world nearly instantaneously, and then convert back to fiat of the receiving country on the other end.  Goodbye Western Union, goodbye wire-transfer fees and excessive delays.
We have seen this usage pattern already today with the business model of a number of companies who are using bitcoin as a way to transfer value world-wide nearly instantaneously and completely bypassing the existing international banking system.
Since bitcoin is now already operating that way, today, I would consider it a success.
If the total market-cap of bitcoins for value transfer remains at 'just' 1.5 billion, as it is today, it still remains a remarkably useful tool for years to come.
There are people who have sugar plum dreams of bitcoin showing outrageous returns over the long term but, in my view, it needs to show only a modest return to still act as a powerful and transformative technology.

For everyone else who just saw the 'pocket change' on their cell phone become worth $800 I strongly recommend you do the same.
If you want to buy a bunch of individual items, their shopping cart system does not combine shipping. However, if you just send them an email, they will give you a price quote for combined shipping and a bitcoin address to send to.

I develop middle-ware for video games on all platforms.  The work I do is used in many apps.  The only apps I have developed myself are small personal test apps.  Our technology is part of the Unity game engine which, in turn, is in numerous applications for both IOS and Android.
You are correct that the fragmentation of Android is/was a problem, but it's becoming less of an issue as we move forward into the more mature generation hardware and OS.

The answer is as a store of wealth. There are 8 trillion dollars of value invested in gold even though it's largely useless. Gold is not accepted in any stores. It is difficult to transport. You can't use it to buy and sell things over the internet. It is difficult to convert to dollars.
Nevertheless, that doesn't prevent eight trillion dollars of wealth from being parked stationary in this metal.
If (and this is a massive giant if) people have as much confidence in bitcoin as a store of value as gold, then the price of gold will plummet and bitcoin will absorb that value because in every practical way it is immeasurably more useful.

Yes, this is normal until you are a customer for a longer period of time.
The problems you are experiencing are not with bitcoin, bitcoin is designed to solve these problems.
These problems arise because coinbase has to operate within the constraints of the traditional banking system to transfer funds to and from your checking account.

Ok, first of all. Most people are not holding onto their bitcoin until they are worth a bazillion dollars.
Most people are cashing out at some point that makes sense to them.  For every person who buys bitcoin, somebody just sold.
People have been selling along this entire ride.  That's why we have this bubble behavior; people buy in, make a 100%, 200%, 300% return and they sell.  I've done it.  Lot's of people have done it.  
Everyone has a sell point.  If you are some newbie who has fantasies that bitcoin is going to be worth a bazillion dollars some day, and you only have 0.1 bitcoins, well, that's just silly behavior.
If you have a coinbase account then buying bitcoin isn't that big of a deal.  I can and have bought (and then spent) bitcoin all of the time.  Lot's of people do it.
As far as why would I use bitcoin over cash, that one is easy, easy, easy.  Bitcoin is more convenient to use then either cash or credit card (at least with an Android phone).
It's simply amazing how easy it is to zap money person to person using a QR code and a cell phone app.
If bitcoin were widely accepted in cafe's, bars, and restaurants, I would use it exclusively all of the time.  I would no longer have to hand my credit card over, risking identity theft as someone goes off into to the back and clones the card (this has happened to me three times over the past several years).  And versus cash, I don't have to wait for exact change.
I would transfer 'pocket/spending' money into bitcoin on a regular basis and I would always use it in place of cash or credit/debit card.
This is how I want to use bitcoin.  Does that mean I won't still keep some in longer term savings?  Of course I will.  But keeping separate 'spending' money from 'savings' is hardly a difficult thing to do.
Why would I want to keep my spending money in bitcoin?  Because (a) it would have a likelihood of appreciating between the time I put it in my 'wallet' and spent it and (b) I would be supporting the bitcoin economy.
Bitcoins are not some magic relics that you have to hold onto.  They are easy to acquire and easy to replenish.

Fee's are not required, but if you include no fee it may take a long time for your transaction to be processed.  Even a very tiny fee, as long as it's not zero, is going to at least prioritize your transaction higher than the rest.  Transactions are processed by 'miners' in priority to the fees they make off of them.  If you are moving around a large amount of money a ten cent fee will probably give your transaction priority enough to get processed in a reasonable time frame.

I spread my bitcoin across many cold-storage addresses.  You are correct that there are major security concerns when it comes to bitcoin, I completely agree.  However, you have to remember that it's a choice.  No one is forcing you to use bitcoin.  You can walk around with credit cards and debit cards that can be stolen or cloned, you can walk around with thousands of dollars of cash in your wallet.
We all make choices about our personal security.
That said, this is one of the reasons why it is my hope/dream that, rather than bitcoin being used by certain individuals to amass massive wealth, I would much prefer if instead a billion people each had just a small amount of bitcoin for relatively small day to day transactions.

Does a bear shit in the woods?  Bitcoin is basically designed to destroy Western Union.  The only thing Western Union could offer now to stave off the invetiable is to act as a bitcoin exchange but, even that, won't help them for long because within a year or two people won't even bother converting bitcoin back to fiat.

Repeating things which are not true in ALL-CAPS does not make your argument stronger.
The US government is broken. Read a newspaper. The world is outraged by NSA abuses and the US subversion of the internet.
The world powers have zero interest in listening to anything the US has to say about regulating an internet technology.
And, finally, you underestimate the power of individuals fight for freedom.
But, hey, you keep writing long, rambling, incoherent, and irrational articles about how bitcoin is doomed to failure while the free people of the world ignore you and use it anyway.
Why do you hate individual freedom?
Why do you give a shit whether I pay for an apple with bitcoin or a dollar?

My daughter just launched a website to sell some of her art prints and I convinced her to start accepting Bitcoin as payment.  Her website uses 'Shopify' as the checkout service and they do not yet support Bitcoin directly.  Apparently a lot of people have been asking for this feature though.
In the meantime, if you want to buy one of her reasonably priced prints, just go through the whole checkout process and on the final page you will be able to pay with Bitcoin to her coinbase account.  However...because it's not totally integrated into the shopping cart system yet you will have to select the correct amount, it's not automatic.
Instead of just gambling your bitcoin away, and once you have eaten all of the Bee's Brothers honey products that you can, why not feed your soul with a little bit of artwork?

Lots of businesses can build on top of bitcoin but you can't easily have a central authority *controlling* bitcoin.  What makes bitcoin special is that there is no central authority.  As soon as their is one, then the gubbmint can come take control over it which is the problem bitcoin is trying to address.  Other companies which have created digital currencies are mostly out of business and many of their founders in jail.

Here's my thought.  People are not going to feel confident about putting $1,000 into bitcoin if they feel that it is too volatile.  However, people will have no fears about putting $20 into bitcoin because they are risking very little.
Now, let's imagine that Starbucks or Subway or some other major retailer accepts bitcoin. 
Now, all of the sudden, these people who put the $20 on their cell-phone wallet have a place to spend it.  They don't need to go to the ATM.  They don't have to whip out a credit card.  So, they start using it because, quite honestly, it's really damned convenient.
Then, these same people start sending small amounts of bitcoin person to person for little things like settling a bill at a shared lunch.
I believe this kind of organic growth can and almost for sure *will* happen in some countries.  There is already a town in Germany where many of the shops accept bitcoin.
I believe the success of bitcoin is going to be in it's widespread use and adoption by the general population transacting *small* sums, not these massive speculative investments like is happening now.
It *is* a chicken and egg problem but progress is being made and judging it a failure before the egg has fully hatched is not fair in my opinion.

However, one thing has been bugging me about paper wallets lately.  It's the fact that if I were to get robbed, the robber could just take my paper wallet and steal the coins.  Maybe just a really secure brain-wallet is the safest way to go.  I gotta keep thinking about it....

Yeah, me too but the realization of how significant an event that would be keeps hitting me.
Just what could the US or any government do to stop people from using bitcoin exclusively? Short of declaring it illegal and starting a 'war on bitcoin' I don't know what they could do.
While they spend the next few years trying to figure out how to regulate exchanges, in that same time, more and more people may just start opting out of fiat entirely. As capital and innovation moves to nongovernment currency their house of cards will begin to crumble.
I have recently decided for myself that I am done with fiat. I get my paycheck, pay my bills, and anything left over no longer goes into fiat, or into anything which touches the government controlled banking system.
That's not 100% true, I still contribute to a conventional 401k as my nod to the established order of things but, beyond that, I'm buying bitcoin and gold.

Maybe another good analogy is to ask yourself the question why is a piece of paper with the number $100 on it valued more than a sheet of paper with the number $1 printed on it?  They are both sheets of paper and ink.  What makes one of them worth more than the other?
It's just because we have a shared belief to assign one as being 100 times more valuable than the other.  It's complete fantasy and self-delusion; it's just a sheet of paper!
If I make a near exact copy of a $100 bill but print 'Bank of John' on it instead of federal reserve note, nobody will give me anything for it.
The fact that human beings assign an arbitrary 'value' on one thing over another is, just that, completely arbitrary.
Bitcoins are worth more than Buttcoins because we all want one and not the other.  
There is a risk that suddenly, one day, everyone is going to realize that US currency is essentially worthless.  This has happened to other currencies when they begin printing too much of it.  A whole lot of US currency has been printed in recent years but, still, it retains a reasonable amount of buying power.  However, that is really, really, at risk.
If you asked me today would I rather have $10,000 in US dollars or $10,000 equivalent at today's exchange rate in bitcoin, I would rather have the bitcoin personally.
It is my personal belief that over say a 5 to 10 year time frame bitcoin is probably going to be a better store of value than the US dollar.
Is there risk?  Sure, there is risk.  There is also risk that US dollars will become nearly worthless in the same time frame or, at least, lose a lot of its buying power.
Would I rather have bitcoin than gold?  That's probably a fairer question.

I think a lot of this growth is fueled by the Chinese exchanges and I tend to think the Chinese are looking for a long term store of value not day trading. Have you seen the real estate boom in China? Since owning an apartment is one of the few ways Chinese can store value/invest bitcoin would be a great outlet for a lot of them.
My point here is that this growth is probably going to explode in coming weeks as Chinese citizens start spreading the word how much their bitcoin 'investment' has increased on paper.
As the value of bitcoin increases its utility will increase as well.
I think it is more likely we are in a cycle of steady growth with small profit taking corrections.

What I think is that many people are sitting on the bulk of their investment.  I also believe that virtually every single person who is 'into' bitcoins would be thrilled to use them for small day-to-day purchases.
While a lot of people are scared about the 'risk' around bitcoins, who's scared about risking 20 bucks?
You buy 20 bucks worth of bitcoin, put it on your cell phone, and (on average) it grows in value.  The day to day fluctuation is hardly going to cause you stress, it's just 20 bucks after all, and you have a rooting interest in the game.
I've given 10-20 dollars worth of bitcoin to a dozen of my friends.  Even though they only have a small amount of bitcoin, they have fun watching the value go up and down and I'm quite certain they would all be thrilled to use it to buy a beer or a cup of coffee.
My point here is that there is enormous pent up demand for people to be able to use bitcoins for day to day small commerce transactions.
All these people who claim 'nobody wants to use bitcoin as a currency' are missing the cart before the horse problem.  You can't use it as a currency hardly anywhere in the physical world.  That one Subway in the US which accepts it has people driving from over a hundred miles away there are people so excited and eager to participate in this new economy.

The reason I am resistant is that I have used the policy in my own mind that I'm only going to risk what I'm willing to lose.  While a part of me would like to keep buying, I'm pretty close to that psychological limit of 'what I'm willing to lose'.  For me that is a little over 15 grand.  I know to really rich people, that's chump change.  I know to a college kid that's a lot.  For myself, that's a decent amount of money to risk on a gamble.
If I were confident that bitcion couldn't come crashing down to zero (and I am not yet) then I would just keep converting any 'extra' fiat that I have to coin.  The day to day ups and downs just really don't concern me.  But, the element of risk that it could all go to zero, is what makes me resistant to buying more.
That said, after writing this post and reading these responses, I just bought 10 more btc at $207 a pop.

When coinbase offers you an 'instant buy' they are giving you a *loan*! They don't get money out of your checking account instantly.  And, guess what, there are a huge number of scammers out there trying to rip people off.
Coinbase still works fine if you show some patience for the funds to clear through the existing archaic banking system.
Coinbase is a business that has to protect itself from fraud and I'm sure once they introduced instant purchase (I.e. instant loan) they ran into issues.
If you have *cash* and want bitcoins then just use localcoins and take your risk getting robbed.
You people are so disconnected from reality it amazes me.

If that were true you could transfer all of your bitcoins to gift cards and avoid paying taxes. I don't think it works that way. I think if you realize a gain, you gotta pay taxes. Let's say you sell $30,000 in bitcoins and then go buy a car. You have to pay taxes on any capital gains.
But you are saying that if you just buy the car (valued at $30,000 US) with bitcoin directly you can avoid paying capital gains?
I'm pretty sure the IRS won't see it that way.
And, really it doesn't matter if its a $30,000 car or a $5 cup of coffee; the principle is the same. Either way you have realized a gain.
The fact that bitcoin behaves both as a commodity and as a currency; fluidly and interchangeably makes this mighty confusing.
The analogy to gold holds to some extent but you can't generally buy a cup of coffee for a bit of gold.

It will reach multiple points of equilibrium and stability over time based on its utility and function. That said, it will grow dramatically over the next ten years if it achieves widespread adoption.

I think its different for a few reasons. First, the Chinese are not fickle. They are not the type to panic sell on a long term investment. Second, there is a lot of 'big money' coming in. They are buying and they too are not going to sell until they have held for a while. Three, the previous crashes were fueled by profit taking and fear. If you haven't taken your profit on your &lt;$9 coins by now what's different? The community has matured. It isn't as skittish expecting it to collapse like a house of cards.
Will it drop? Yes it will. Will people who now think a 'cheap coin' means &lt;$200 rush in to buy? Yes.

So...there are two ways to invest in bitcoin; long term or short term.  If you want to churn the markets and buy/sell, buy/sell, and play that game, go for it.
The other way to invest in bitcoin is for the long term, with the belief that it's going to become a major world wide currency and increase in value by an order of magnitude over time.
In either case, don't invest a single penny in bitcoin unless you are willing to lose every single penny of it.  It's hardly even investing at this point, it's better to think of it as gambling.
You could also consider, rather than buying bitcoin all at once, buy it over a period of time to 'dollar average', but I don't know if that makes sense or not.
I have personally 'invested' (i.e. gambled) $3,500 of my own personal money to buy a grand total of about 30 coins; with an average cost of $116 a coin.
At this moment, bitcoin is at about $109, so I'm already a 'loser'.  But, you can't think about it like that if you are in it for the long term.  
I'm in the game just to be along for the ride.  I think there is a very strong possibility that bitcoin is going to be worthless within the next year.  I hope I'm wrong, but given how our government behaves, I tend to think not.
I made this blog post on the topic.
Personally, if you have $1,000 to piss away, and a strong stomach, why not be along for the ride?
You are already kicking yourself in the ass for not buying $1,000 worth of bitcoins when they were worth $2 a pop (today would be worth about $50,000). 
Bitcoin likely has just two outcomes.  Major success or complete collapse.  There isn't a whole lot of in between over the long term.
It's a minor thing right now, with a market cap of only about $1.3 billion dollars.  It's just a play toy for people today.
The next year will probably determine the future of bitcoin.  The government will simply outlaw it, or it will be accepted as a mainstream currency that can be widely used to buy goods and services.
I tend to think the government will just outlaw it; because it represents far too great of a threat to their constituency (the banking lobby).
There are people who will, correctly, claim that you 'can't shut bitcoin down', which is true in a sense.  You will always be able to transmit biticoins to and from other users of bitcoin.  But, what the government *can* do is pass a law stating that it is a crime for any business to trade goods or services for cryptocurrency.
I think there is every possibility they will do something this drastic in the coming months.  
So, yeah, 'invest' (i.e. gamble) your $1,000 in bitcoin.  They are on sale today; only $109 when they were $130 a couple of weeks ago.
But, realize, that your chances of losing almost all of that 'investment' are extremely high.

Dude, taxes aren't the problem.  Taxes are the price we pay for living in a civilized society.  Get over it.
Bitcoin is *not* about avoiding paying your taxes. 
Bitcoin is about being able to have a store of value which cannot be debased or confiscated by the government or corporations.
Am I thrilled with how every penny of my taxes are spent?  Of course not.  Who is?  But I like public schools, I like public roads, I like having police, EMT, and a fire department.  I like having social security, medicare, and medicaid.
If you don't want to pay taxes, then move to another country.  But if you want to be a citizen of the United States' that's just part of the deal; as is the case in most countries throughout the world.
But, hey, you go find yourself some libertarian anarchist nirvana without roads and where old people are left to starve and die.  Have fun with that...

Yes, I admit it I was wrong.  Yesterday many on Reddit claimed that the Chinese people could still use bitcoin to buy and sell goods and services; only banks were prohibited from treating as a currency.
Well, a day later, and it appears this is clearly not the case.
We will have to see what happens on the ground with citizens.  Will restaurants, and shops, and vendors not accept it because they fear the state, or will they just use it anyway? 
Since China is allowing the exchanges to stay open this could create a big problem.  If you can't openly exchange bitcoin person to person, it will get driven underground and that will fuel a whole bunch of criminal activity which will not be a good thing in the long run.

I just posted the following response to this article which I am copying here.
Your critique here seems to boil down to two essential concerns (and please correct me if I'm wrong); the first is technical and the second is economic.
You don't seem opposed to the concept of the revolutionary nature of crypocurrency in general, you just seem mostly concerned that bitcoin itself is a poor implementation of one that is inadequate to the task.
This is fairly short sighted.  So, let's be clear; all bitcoin 'is', is an entry into a public ledger system.
You can (and many have) made a copy of the bitcoin source code and created their own public ledger.  We can call is John-Coin, or Larry-Coin, or Bullshit-Coin.  It really doesn't matter because nobody wants to have entries in any of those databases.
They only thing they want is an entry in one specific public database that we call 'bitcoin'. (Yes, some people use 'litecoin' or other variants but they are likely always going to be the red-headed step-child as far as which database holds the most value.)
Now, the actual 'value' of bitcoin is represented as an entry into that specific database and not some other database.  
Your concern seems to be that the implementation of that database is bloated and insufficient to meet the needs of a larger economy. 
Now, that is a fair point but...this assumes that the technology behind the database is static.  And, it is not.  I am a software engineer myself and in a moment I can think of a half dozen ways to improve how that database is represented and stored.
The bitcoin database can be reconfigured in a dozen different ways, it can be improved upon in an iterative fashion over time.  In fact, the people at the bitcoin foundation are actively working on these features.  So long as everyone's ledger entries are still represented and recorded, then the entire database can be re-written and re-organized dozens of times.  
Quite frankly, your critique on technical merit really doesn't hold up.  The underlying technology for bitcoin can (and will be) improved repeatedly as it grows over time.  
I'm going to assume that you are not personally a software engineer and, therefore, simply don't know what you are talking about here, but suffice it to say, what you are describing are 'first world problems'.  If bitcoin grows to a much larger scale (and that's a bit if) then the technology for how transactions are processed and the ledger stored will advance accordingly.
It will become, over time, the bitcoin 2.0 which you claim it should be.  Your critique makes the assumption that the technology underlying bitcoin is static and fixed; incapable of responding to the changing needs and demands of the marketplace, and that is simply not the case.
Your other major critique seems to center around the fact that bitcoin is a deflationary currency.  This concern is legitimate and is definitely the larger issue at hand.  This is the one thing about bitcoin that you simply cannot change or adapt; bitcoin is designed to be deflationary and that will never change.
As a deflationary currency this puts it at risk of massive hoarding of wealth and the ability of those hoarders to cause massive influence on the markets.  We already see that happening today.
There are quite lengthy and well reasoned debates about the merits and flaws of a true deflationary currency.  I am not an economist, nor do I pretend to be one.  Are you an economist yourself?  I'm not sure your post here constitutes a thorough vetting of the advantages and disadvantages of a true (infinitely divisible) deflationary currency.
At the end of the day, people are going to have a choice.  They can either use bitcoin as a store of value, or they can choose to not use it at all.
Realize that one of the most revolutionary and immediately practical uses of bitcoin is not as store of value but, rather, as a transmitter of value.  Companies like BitPay and others have business models that don't even care particularly what the current value of a bitcoin is or even necessarily how volatile it might be.  They simply use it s a conduit to transfer value from point A to point B.
I think over the next year or so, this is going to be the primary strength and functionality of bitcoin, as this is already happening today.  And, in regards to your technical concerns, very smart people just like me will quickly work to resolve those.

Bitcoins are an extremely high risk investment.  Currently today they are primarily a speculative bubble (meaning most of their value is based solely on the shared belief that some day they will become valuable).  This kind of bubble could be popped permanently and, in fact, *will* be popped permanently if bitcoins end up ultimately have no great real-world value.
Bitcoins have already experienced numerous bubbles which have collapsed over time.  To date it has always recovered, sometimes quickly sometimes taking a lot longer.  Bitcoin will most likely continue to experience bubbles for a very long time to come. 
Bitcoins can easily collapse and lose almost all of their value simply due to regulatory and legal pressure in the coming months.
So, as has been said here many times before, don't invest (gamble) any more money on bitcoins than you can afford to lose.  
Betting on bitcoin right now is akin to betting on a blackjack hand.  You might win..but you could lose everything too.  
If you wanted me to give you a prediction what chance bitcoin has to survive for the next few years, I would put it at 50/50 for it to survive and still retain value that you can easily liquidate (via conversion to fiat or real-world purchases).

Another question, if anyone can think or any other data they would like to see plotted 'over time' about the blockchain let me know.  This was really just my first attempt at it.

I have now heard it said here, and elsewhere, something that to me seems just blatantly untrue. This idea that bitcoin is difficult to actually use as currency.
This is simply not true. Factually false!
Probably the coolest thing about bitcoin is how easy it is to use. From scanning a QR code on your cell phone, to embedding a 'pay with bitcoin' button on a website, to just using an ASCII address its crazy easy to use, and fun.
If you can find a retail establishment which will accept bitcoin, and of course that is the real problem, scanning a receipt with your cell phone is simply so much faster and convenient than handing over cash and making change or waiting for a credit card receipt and signing it.
When people write articles about bitcoin and make such absolute basic errors in reporting it makes me think they either don't know what they are talking about or are willfully spreading disinformation.
Bitcoin is hard to use because hardly any retail outlets accept it. However, for the places which do accept it, it is far easier to use than cash.
Even just giving money person to person, in person, is easier; because you don't have to 'make change', you just touch your cellphones together.
Assuming the original poster wrote this, and I doubt you did, why did you write something so blatantly false? Are you simply ignorant or intentionally spreading FUD?

Its really steady though. To me it just looks like a whole lot of buy in without much sell pressure.
I believe most of the money coming in now is from long term investors. In the past, bubbles have popped due to fear.
This one will/can pop too but it will require an actual event to make that happen. If there is no event which happens to cause people to lose faith in bitcoin I think it can simply continue to grow for a lot longer.
If the Chinese government were to make some negative statement about bitcoin then, yeah, the bubble would burst.

For a couple of weeks movement has been very narrow and every time it drops below $100 it quickly bounces back. The fact that its hovering around a $100 was my point.

I might also add, that if you read my 'bitcoin-is-doomed' post, you will see that it is articles like Mr. Hicks which exactly proves my point.  Demonizing bitcoin users as child molesters is a pretty offensive exact case in point for what I predicted would happen.
I predicted that once banks/governments realize just how big of a threat bitcoin is, then it is naive to think they won't attack it in a wide variety of ways.  Now, with a number of recent articles, we can see these attacks already beginning to occur.
My only hope is that bitcoin will thrive in other countries who are in no mood to listen to what the US has to say.  Over time, if bitcoin is legal and successful throughout the rest of the world but the US won't even allow their own citizens to use it, maybe, just maybe, that will keep it alive.
Also, let's face it, financial types like their toys.  Bitcoin is a giant toy that is capable of making a whole lot of people rich.
I own 100 bitcoins, representing a $10,000 very, very, risky investment.  But other people have millions of dollars at stake.  Maybe they can fight the FUD?  I don't know, I'm doing my part.

I am already 'well off'', not retire for life well off, but I have a good job and I have extra money that I can afford to put into a risky investment.  I am also a sport car enthusiast and I have owned many, many, many, sports cars in my life.  I started buying sports cars when I was in my early 20's and I'm 52 now.  This isn't my first 'cool car', I've owned about twenty.
With sport cars, I'm all about variety and I generally buy a new one every year or two.  To be clear, I would have bought this car today anyway.
This car belongs to a friend of mine.  I've told him for over 10 years that when he is ready to sell it, I'm the first one in line.  Today he finally decided it was time to part with the car (he is the original owner, I've driven it many times, I know the exact history of this car).  He just bought a Tesla Model S.
This morning I filed for a car loan as I didn't have ready cash on hand for the purchase (I don't keep much in fiat currency, I have other investments).  Then I thought, why am I getting a loan?  Why not sell my bitcion when it's a $350 apiece, and use it to buy something I want?
So I did.
I didn't make this post to brag.  I made this post as a big *FUCK YOU* to the resident Reddit bitcoins troll 'witcoins' who has been harassing me for weeks for being such a complete fucking idiot for investing $16k into bitcoins.

Sigh, this has been answered soo... many times already.
Bitcoin isn't just a currency its also a value transfer protocol.
There are numerous avenues for vendors to accept bitcoin and then have it converted to the equivalent fiat immediately.
Right now bitcoin is still in a very early adoption phase. If it ever reaches widespread worldwide acceptance as a currency then, over time, it will naturally stabilize in value.
That said, bitcoin likely will, over time, appreciate in value. 
People have a *choice*. Keep your payment in bitcoin, or fiat.
No one is being forced to only accept bitcoin.  Its a choice an individual makes.
If its too volatile for you then just use it as a value transfer protocol and convert to fiat immediately. Problem solved.
Me, personally, I would much rather have bitcoin than fiat.

* Correction!  There is one public key for each private key.  I was confused because the bitcoin-qt software generates (under the hood) like 100 private-key/public-key pairs at a time.  When you create a 'new address' in Bitcoin-QT it's not technically new; it's drawing it from a pool of pre-allocated keys.  That's why you can load an old Bitcoin-QT wallet and still have access to coins transferred using newer addresses.

Sending bitcoin tips on Reddit, that's kind of preaching to the choir.  But giving out bitcoin to strangers on your cell phone, dude, you *gotta* do that.
This evening, at the restaurant, I gave this example/use case.
You are out for a meal with friends.  The check comes and one of your friends throws a credit card at it.  Your portion is $12.37.  You point your cell phone at your friend's cell phone and, zap, you have sent them your portion of the check.
That simple use case is so completely freaking awesome it's incredible!

My response to the author reads: 
Thanks for a very intelligently written article.  It is much more thoughtful than most anything I have read elsewhere on the topic.
You may very well be right, but I am eager to see this experiment play out.  
Currently, today, you can hardly buy anything anywhere with bitcoin.
And, for the record, I personally own 70 bitcoins.  But, you see, I did own 120 bitcoins three days ago.  Why did I sell 50 of them?  Because I wanted to buy a new car.
At a certain point you can't just keep saving for the sake of saving.  At a certain point you want to use your savings to buy things.
More to the point, the biggest issue in the short term is that bitcoin cannot operate as a currency because it is hardly accepted anywhere.
Now, let's fast forward a few years into a theoretical future when bitcoin is, let's say, widely accepted nearly everywhere.
If such a day were to come, then what I would do is convert almost all of my 'spare' fiat (after paying my most basic monthly bills) into bitcoin.  I would keep all of my day to day 'spending' money in bitcoin rather than fiat.  I would use it everywhere for my regular purchases.
I know many people besides myself interested in the bitcoin revolution who are also looking forward to spending their bitcoins and opting out of fiat whenever and wherever possible.
I say let's just let this experiment run itself out.
You might wonder why so many people are so interested in this change.  It has to do with wanting to find a way to operate independent of the traditional banking system.
Have you ever tried to go to an ATM and take out more than say $500?  Nope, it won't let you.  Try to ask for your own money from a bank, and you may be treated as a potential criminal.  No one tells you what you can do with your own bitcoin.
Try taking out or depositing more than $10k into a traditional banking system?  Wait..you must be a suspected terrorist or drug lord.
We are supposed to live in a free country but ever since the Patriot act and the NSA running wild, it hasn't even come close to resembling a free country for quite a while.
The fundamental motivation of most people involved in bitcoin is less economic than it is political.  We want our freedom back.  We want to control our *own* money.
This is about taking back our own freedom and free-will from the nanny state who thinks it can tell us what we can do with our own money and when, where, and how we can spend it.

Great question. For me it was the number of times I've told my wife 'this is gonna be the next big thing' then, didn't do anything about it, and sure enough it was.
I'm a software engineer, I understand the underlying technology behind bitcoin intimately, and I understand its long term revolutionary potential.
Like most long-term investors in bitcoin I only see two outcomes, wild unbridled success where bitcoin rivals Visa and MasterCard as a payment system, or it is completely outlawed by government run by corporations smart enough to see the threat it poses.
I'm not a poor guy, I have literally spent over $10k a year on car repair bills (I've owned some exotic and specialty cars) so I can afford to gamble, and I do mean gamble, 10k on the long tern success of bitcoin.
I just want it to reach the point when I can use it most everywhere I can use a credit card today. When/if that happens I will not keep one penny of liquid capital in fiat any more.

Neither has any intrinsic value. It only has 'value' because a bunch of people all agree (I.e. magically, mystically, believe) that it does.
You can't convince me that the fact that bitcoins have no intrinsic value is somehow different than the fact that paper money has no intrinsic value.

I don't think, from what I've read that this is a big concern.  At any rate, such activity would be quickly detected and would be addressed.  Even in the paper proposing this kind of attack, it lists a number of 'solutions/fixes'.  People forget that bitcoin is a not a static object frozen in stone, it is a piece of software/protocol managed by large team of co-operative people who all have tremendous interest in it being safe and secure.




Well, if rewards for minors go down, they might cry or throw a fit.  Oh, wait, I think you mean 'miners'.  Markets reach equilibrium.  There will always be money to be made mining and people will always want to make money doing it.
That's not to say some people might drop out, but that just makes it more attractive for the rest.  That's how equilibrium will be met.


The system seems to be working pretty well so far.


No, it will not.  I think what is going to happen first is that having transactions on the blockchain may grow as a highly valuable resource and there will be more and more sub-networks offering off-blockchain transactions which are only put on the main block-chain as needed.
Yes, the system can be adapted to support a higher transaction rate, but that's a major effort and will take a lot of time.
The thing is, we tend to think of these concerns as 'first world problems'.  By the time they actually become a problem, it will imply that bitcoin is a huge success and many people will be highly incentivized to fix them.

I used coinbase.  I don't really have a 'sell target' as my target is when bitcoin is so widely accepted I don't even have to convert to fiat to buy things except, maybe, to pay taxes on gains.  I suppose if it ever hits 10k a bitcoin I might buy some things then.  Anything less than  that, it's not worth cashing out for.  To be clear, I'm a very high net worth individual so this is not a 'lot' of money to me.

The  thing that was preventing people from getting into bitcoin was a fear that governments would declare it illegal.  Now it appears that this risk is getting less every day.  The  fear is that somehow the bitcoin system could collapse due to a bug in the software or some kind of an attack.  I think this remains a real and legitimate fear.  The  fear is that the whole thing is a giant speculative bubble that could just collapse on a whim.  This too is a legitimate fear.
However, as time goes on, all three of these fears will gradually be reduced.  When enough time passes that people have complete confidence in bitcoin as a long term store of value then I'm afraid Peter has a bigger problem.  Gold may collapse as people start abandoning it as the standard for storing value and switch to using bitcoin instead.
I suspect that over the next year or two some percentage of all of the current value stored in gold will be shifted into bitcoin as people gain more confidence in the system.  It probably won't be much at first, but enough to probably keep gold prices depressed.

I own 70 bitcoins. They cost me $0. I'm a software engineer. Bitcoin is probably not perfect. It will be improved over time.
But this notion that the state can tell you what you can or cannot do with your own money, and can even go so far declare your money as having committed a crime, and confiscate it. Its gotta stop.
The sheer irony that the average Chinese citizen enjoys more free market capitalism than the average American has got to stop.
My money is not a criminal.

If you aren't a developer why would you use an app that downloads the entire blockchain?  That just seems like over-kill to me.  The only reason I have BitcoinQT on my machine is because I'm a computer programmer and I am writing blockchain analysis software.  I don't even use it in any way as a wallet any more.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:04:57
I just made a similar post.  I think a big mover is going to be using bitcoin for small transactions.  We have too many people too wrapped up with the idea of investing tens of thousands of dollars in bitcoin.  What about investing $10?  Who's going to be scared of the volatility if they are only risking $10 or $20 at a time?
It's like playing scratchers.  You buy $10 worth of bitcoin on your cell phone and, a week later, you find out it's worth $11.  Cool right?  Or you find out it's worth $9.  Oh well, is that going to make you lose sleep or cry over it?  No.  Is that going to prevent you from using it to pay for a beer or a cup of coffee?  No.
We need to bootstrap the use of it as currency by finding an outlet for spending bitcoin in relatively small amounts.  This is the missing piece of the puzzle.
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:50:05
This analysis sounds about right but I will add this. My personal hope for bitcoin is not about making me, or anyone else rich, it's about bringing financial services to the unbanked throughout the world.
Bitcoin works just fine in tiny amounts and can empower small businesses around the world if they catch on. I want bitcoin to grow organically from the bottom up, person to person, because it works.

Well, I'm an old timer.  I am 52 years old and the first computer I programmed was an Apple-II in 1979.  The first computer I ever bought was an Apple-IIc which cost me an absurd amount of money and put me in debt for years.  I love Wozniak and love what Apple used to be and represent.
However, once they created a closed system which did not allow developers to simply write their own software, I had no use for them.
It took a ridiculously long time for a viable Iphone alternative to come about.  However, a couple of years ago Google finally did it with with Android reaching the point where you could give up your Iphone and not miss it...too much.  The biggest problem at that time was that there weren't many good apps for the Android.  Today the apps on Android are not only as good as on the Iphone but, as we are now learning, there are a bunch of innovative apps that you can *only* get on Android due to Apple's nanny approach to app approval.
Now, fast forward to December 9, 2013, and the Iphone looks like a joke.  It looks like a childish toy compared to a current generation version of Android.  The Android operating system is powerful and feels like you are using a real computer; whereas the Iphone looks like something you would hand to your toddler to play with which, quite frankly, many people do.
While Google does offer the Play store I am *not* required to use it.  I can write a piece of software for any of my android devices and give it away or sell it however I wish without asking permission from Google or anyone else, nor do I have to give them a cut of the action.
Now, if I sell it through Google and let them do marketing, distribution, and payment processing for a cut, then that is a personal choice.
I'm so done with Apple, and so is much of the world.  The market share for the Iphone is going down every single day and the more they try to prop up their closed system, the faster their market share is going to shrink.
Spread the word, do not support the Apple ecosystem.

That is simply not true. The US considers all exchanges money service business providers and subject to all regulations that implies. They already confiscated a bunch of MtGox money too.
 
That's why you have to enter so much personal information at coinbase and if you withdraw more than 10k a nice little report goes to the feds.
Exchanges in the US are regulated and just barely being allowed to operate so far. And, oh yeah, New York sent supenea's out to a bunch of bitcoin related businesses.
