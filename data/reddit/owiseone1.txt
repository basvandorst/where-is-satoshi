yes it does seem pretty shady and that's why i'm freaking out about sending them my ID.  I'm wondering the odds my DL # will fall into the wrong hands and is there anything I can do like getting a new DL # from the DMV?

no, i was only buying bitcoin from them to pay a seedbox.  The blacklist has something to do with me requesting to delete my info.

Looks like coinsource has an atm here in Vegas for a cash purchase.  I've never used them, does anyone know if they're legit?

I just tried it again and it worked.  It ended up taking $24 dollars out of my coinbase account to pay the 7 euro invoice.  Is there a better way for me to pay these invoices so I dont have to pay 15 dollars in fees?
Last month I paid about 11 dollars with the fee for this 7 euro invoice and this month it took 24 dollars.  Can you explain what you mean by change and dust in the account?

I'm having the same problem.  Trying to pay a seedhost.eu balance of 11 dollars and I have 25 dollars in my coinbase account and it's saying insufficient balance.  Is the fee really more than 14 dollars?

ive been paying for this seedbox every month for over a year and this is the first month this has happened to me.  Usually have 9 dollars or so in my mycelium, the invoice is 7 euro and they just take all of it and approve.
What does low miner fee mean?  I have no control over the fee it was generated automatically.
