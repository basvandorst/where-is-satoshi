It's not an exchange. They mine the bitcoin.

I sold somewhere around there so you might have bought one of my coins. Thanks bro.

Or you throw a few grand, if you can afford it, at the hot shitcoin and triple your money in a few days. You can keep the majority in bitcoin, but still make a lot of money on the side. In this kind of crypto bull market you would be an idiot to miss out on the easy money out there right now. Obviously don't play with money you can't afford to play with.

No, people buy gold because it's a stable store of value and a market hedge. People buy bitcoin as a risky investment to sell at a higher price.

That's why I said limited edition.

They will if they think someone else will pay them 12000 for it someday.

Gold is a shiny rock that you can actually hold in your hand and no one else can replicate. Bitcoin is more like digital limited-edition Chuck-e-cheese tokens.

I said bitcoin is like digital limited edition Chuck-e-cheese tokens, you can send them to people and a few people accept them as payment. Most people buy the tokens to sell at a higher price, other people are waiting to use them at chuck-e-cheese.

Lol bitcoin has never had to face a deflationary event, trust me we will get one eventually and when we do you best hope all your wealth is in USD so you can take advantage of all the buying power.
Also bitcoin will continue to be inflationary until the year 2140 when no more bitcoin are minted anymore. The current bitcoin inflation rate from New coins is about 4% a year, so your going to have to wait a few decades before you get the deflationary bitcoin.

That's not right. Say i buy a contract for bitcoin for 18k and price drops and now the same contract I bought is trading for 12k, I can sell it and take a 6k loss, you don't get locked into the contract as you are implying. Its the same dynamics as trading regular bitcoins. 
The reason for the existence of the futures market is for suppliers of commodities to hedge their products against large swings. If I'm a wheat farmer I can sell wheat futures at a set price and hedge against lower wheat prices; if wheat price goes down I'm hedged by my short contracts and if price goes up I can sell my wheat for more money and counter any loss on the contracts.

Correct. Fixed assets are deflationary by nature as long as there is economic growth.

Look at Mr.ImaTrueHodler over here, doesn't care about volatility and never checks price. I guess everyone who minds price must be a fake fluffer.

Another FUDster.

Is this a JP Morgan quote, how ironic.

Bitcoin will replace all stocks and currencies. Why would anyone invest in stocks when they can buy bitcoins and make more money that way. It's only a matter of time before the stock market crashes and disappears and everyone moves into crypto.

It's not that hard to buy sell stocks because the stock brokers are actually regulated and professional, money doesn't get stick in limbo or take forever to get to the account, and there is absolutely no buy sell limit on your account. Takes about 3 days to setup and you can buy as much as you want.
