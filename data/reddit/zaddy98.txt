Cool, but what's your point? I can't use a word incorrectly even though it is obvious which use of the word I meant?
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:59:57
Not under a rock.

So there's no chance the top 10-20 coins by market cap might increase in the same way in 2018 that they did this last year?

How likely is it that bitcoin will reach $1,000,000 per coin in the next 5 or so years?

So is it safe to say that it is always more profitable to buy bitcoin and hodl as opposed to buy cloud mining (provided it's actually not a scam)?

People keep saying that if everybody starts selling their bitcoin the price will drop. But if everybody is selling doesn't that mean a lot of people are buying at the same time? will the price still drop anyway even though a lot of people are buying? it's not like the bitcoin disappears after it's sold..

I didn't personally because I haven't moved bitcoin in a while, but a lot of people on this sub are saying they're paying $30-40 each transaction and that it takes ages to for the bitcoin to move. Also $10 is still pretty high.

Still, the  wallet has 134k and it belongs to bitfinex. There's nothing even close to 1 million. Even if the estimate is inaccurate you'd think that it would be at least something close to that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:24:14
So are fees gonna stay at $30-40 or are they gonna go back down to what they used to be? how much longer do we have to wait?

If bitcoin mining is getting harder every 4.5 years, and the max amount that could ever be mined is 21 million, doesn't that simply mean the it's value is bound to go up first and then maybe flat line because it's getting harder and harder to get?

I'm new to this and there's something I'm trying to understand.  
Let's say I just bought $500 of btc at around $10k per btc and then I made a stop-limit order on Poloniex to sell all my btc if the price drops to $8k. Then lets say the price crashed to $2k like a lot of people are saying is going to happen. Doesn't that mean that I only lost 20% of my money? because after $8k I'll already have my USD and all my btc will already have been sold right?
So is it just me or is it a lot less scary to invest in btc when you have stop-limit orders?

What's the most secure wallet you can use that'll still allow you to quickly and easily check how much money your bitcoin is worth with an app on your phone like blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:19:44
Why would you want to get out if it crashes? that's when you're supposed to buy more
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:27:18
But is it likely that it's going to be a lot more difficult to find people that are willing to buy once the price gets really high?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:23:28
What are the best twitters to follow to keep up to date on what's going on with bitcoin and crypto in general?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:40:18
im one year older than you and also have about 0.1BTC, and im buying $20 more every week. hopefully we'll be MILLIONAIRES by 30
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:08:49
That's exactly what I'm thinking about doing. Have most of the money in the top coins that are already established, and then a small percentage spread out across a few penny coins that might blow up. I just don't know whether I should split the top coins evenly or have a higher percentage in bitcoin than the rest.

Why doesn't satoshi's 1 million bitcoin wallet show here?  
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:25:49
Thank you so much! :)

Some people are saying that at some point in the future if bitcoin's price goes way up it's gonna be really hard to sell because exchanges are mostly interested in selling bitcoins and not buying. Is this true? for example if bitcoin goes up to $100,000 per 1 btc is it really gonna be harder to sell that 1 btc to coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:02:14
So you're telling me right now Satoshi is worth 14 BILLION dollars? jesus... someone put him on the forbes list
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:04:13
Thanks for the explanation

I invested $1500 into btc at around $16500 and that was my first time ever buying. Lost a bunch of money so far but have literally zero desire to sell, in fact I kinda wanna buy more. What is wrong with me...
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:43:44
Am i the only one who gets anxious/annoyed that its going up so much? I have a little btc and i'm making money but man i wish i had a fuckton more $ invested. I hope it goes down so i can buy more...
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:23:47
Newbie question but does investing in bitcoin earn you compound interest?  
For example lets say I bought 1 btc at $100, and each day bitcoin's value goes up by 1%. So day 1 I have $100 worth of btc, day 2 $101, but day 3 I get 1% of the $101  so I'll have $102.01 right?  
If that's correct, then how can I calculate how much my bitcoin is gonna be worth after a certain period of time, provided it increases a certain known percentage everyday AND I add money to it every week?  
Let's say I bought $100 worth of btc now, and I buy $20 more every week for the next 3 years. And the price of bitcoin goes up an average of 1% per day during those 3 years. Can I use a compound interest calculator to calculate how much my bitcoin will be worth?

Are they crashing because bitcoin is crashing?

How do you guys switch your coins around for example btc to ltc? shapeshift or is there a better way?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:27:47
Are there any wallets that show the various coins you own in a similar way to how Exodus does it but also support mobile?  Exodus looks great but it's desktop only
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:58:31
I actually never thought about putting a sell order at a high price. It makes a lot of sense. The problem though is that you would probably have to constantly adjust the price you want to sell at because the price just keeps going up.  
Another thing is if the price crashes I feel like I would be even more tempted to buy because chances are it will recover, at least according to what has happened during the last few years.

I currently have $100 of btc in my blockchain.info wallet and I want to invest about $900 more to make it a nice round $1000. Should I keep all of it in my wallet or should I move it to Poloniex where I can make stop limit orders and sell my btc in the event where the price suddenly crashes?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:24:51
Since bitcoin is getting harder to mine all the time and the max that can be mined is 21 million does this mean that eventually the price of bitcoin will go up and it will stay that way?
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:51:40
Is it realistic for it to get back up to 20k this year?
