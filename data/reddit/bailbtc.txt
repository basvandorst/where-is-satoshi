Bitcoin has been a pretty huge failure for a lot of people that invested in it, largely due to the alternatives not seeming all that bad to most normal people. So the narrative is that the entire world has to burn then bitcoin will be good.

I think if you look at metrics like r/bitcoin readership, searches on google, money transfered through bitcoin and so on you can see it's losing momentum pretty much steadily since mt gox stole a huge percent of the economy and silkroad got shut down and basically hasn't recovered at all.

No matter what you do blocks come every ten minutes on average, near instant isn't possible at any fee. Unless you count zero confirmations, in which case blocks (and the blockchain) barely matter how long it takes and you might as well not even have it.

The N-gage had more users than bitcoin does. The fact YOU invested into bitcoin doesn't mean that everyone is locked to it forever. It's network effect is currently tiny to the point of nonexistance.

Bitcoin is decentralized to about 15 developers, 6000 full nodes, 8 miners, and ~750,000 users.
Fiat at worst is decentralized to several hundred independent countries, and thousands of unrelated banks. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:36:00
The thing is if you use this logic then 20 mb blocks only allow 12 million users. Which would give bitcoin a userbase less than HALF the size of the userbase nintendogs or kinect adventures have. 
(Ps. I had to use things twice as big because it's not even easy to find charts that list games that sell that bad to find funny comparisons)

Are you calling the great satoshi incorrect? Was he wrong about needing a blockchain to prevent double spends? Did he just waste his time solving that issue when all he needed to do was have the merchants "take steps"? Whatever that means? And not even need blockchains at all?

Bitcoin doesn't own the word blockchain. Dogecoin is a blockchain. I'm sorry that the fact bitcoin isn't unique upsets you so much and someone using another blockchain won't make you rich but you don't get to define words by what you think will make you money.

Right now bitcoin has .5 to 1.5 million users. 
3 years from now clearly it will have 7 billion users, that is just math.

Answer the question. How would "just add a few more pennies" work in an actual economy where everyone wasn't following the latest blockchain stress test news? 
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:41:09
Credibly explain how a system with less than 1 million users, less than 20 major miners, less than 6000 P2P nodes and less than 5 centralized payment management systems for virtually all merchants is entrenched so much that it can't possibly be replaced so we are locked into no economic freedom to use another system already.

Not really, even if the bitcoin idea became popular it doesn't guarantee bitcoin itself will. The only think bitcoin has locking anyone to it is a very thin and misunderstood application of "the network effect". It's still a huge risk that actual bitcoin will not succeed longterm even if it's "possibilities" come to pass with successors.

When bitcoin was invented the idea was you'd run a program that is a wallet and mines and transfers transactions. Because people didn't quite think ahead well enough that got split into people running wallets, people transferring transactions and people mining all as separate people. Miners mine, wallets are wallets, nodes transfer transactions but reward you in no way and take a bunch of resources and basically have turned libertarianism into charity work for gullible people to support the early adopters.

Bitcoin hasn't developed much since 2009 so you see a lot of weird anachronistic stuff from when it was new. In 2009 there was a brief popular surge in people being angry at "banks".

When satoshi invented bitcoin he imagined it as a p2p thing like bit torrent, where a user would be a node, would be a miner. In that system all the users DID get votes on stuff like this.

The incentive was that you could mine and that bitcoin was p2p.

No, absolutely not.

The process doesn't make sense and will never happen. People talk about bitcoin being the world economy because they are late adopters and they want to pretend they will still get the 10000x return the early adopters got, but to get that they realize the number is too big to be sane, but being idiots instead of saying "oh, that isn't going to happen" they imagine that in 5 years all the world's money is going to be turned over to a few hundred people for no apparent reason because that is the only way the 150 dollars they invested is going to make them as rich as they plan on it making them.

Each block contains around .05 to .1 btc in miners fee. Or between around 15-30 dollars. 
The delusional answer is always that somehow bitcoin is going to grow so huge that .05 bitcoin is suddenly a kajillion dollars or that use will spike by millions of percent and there will be more fees. 
Both of these are based on hope and dreams and wishes and if bitcoin stays as it is or has been for the last six years you are totally correct and bitcoin has a countdown timer for it's survival. 
(note that over time the amount of fees collected has generally FALLEN, not grown)

Other coins use different confirmation times but bitcoin couldn't really be changed because changing it would change the inflation rate at some degree, even if you changed the reward so it worked out the same over longer time scales.
