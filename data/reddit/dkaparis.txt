I took advantage of the offer almost a year ago and obviously they still haven't dropped it.

On the contrary, it is very much excludable. Any meaningful use of bitcoin requires the wilful cooperation of a miner to confirm your transactions.

Because at this point it's probably not likely "enough 21Inc devices" will be deployed for that and most certainly not "inevitable".

Do you see supporting any mining pool whatsoever as contradiction, since its success would lead to centralization?

It becomes impractical tracking income and thus enforcing income taxes.

Not the same with regards to employee theft, since in that case there is supposedly an identifiable person to go after for the funds stolen.

Agreed on the MITM danger - any non-ssl traffic must be suspect. The same is true for clearnet by the way, but with Tor the problem is magnified by the fact that there are malicious exit nodes actively sniffing and engaging in MITM.
I don't follow your second point, though. Using clearnet there is no presumption of unlinkability of subsequent actions, no Tor to run separate instances of, or restart. So how exactly using Tor for normal everyday browsing make life of spies easier compared to using clearnet?

I'm really not here to educate you or the world, but let me tell you this: if you think reading a vdi file is somehow problematic, or adequate detriment to a determined attacker, then refer here:

Follow common security practices(keep your system and programs up to date, don't do stupid things, run current antivirus scanner, etc) regardless of operating system. For large values, just keep it encrypted, offline.
Your advice accomplishes absolutely nothing, besides subjecting the user to vulnerabilities in the guest, in addition to the host system.

This explains nothing.
Current situation: no one cares about Bitcoin and people with bitcoins can not spend them in any meaningful way.
Hypothetical situation: no one cares about Bitcoin and people with bitcoins can spend them anywhere.
In what way exactly is hypothetical situation worse than current?


Where is that incentive now that wouldn't be there then?

And how does Paypal accepting BTC make things worse?

Looks interesting, I'll keep an eye on this!

You may consider refraining from giving technical advice on security when you don't know what you're talking about.

Sorry, didn't realize it was not publically accessible. I'll try to repost the thing as published somewhere else.

It's the probability to discover the next block in the private chain before the public network discovers the next block in the public chain.
