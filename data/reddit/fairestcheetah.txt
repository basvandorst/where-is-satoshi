If my understanding of the negative balances thing is right, the people who have negative balances are the people whose buys (at über-low prices) couldn't be reverted because they successfully withdrew the funds before MT closed down the exchange - so they're actually the only winners here. MT will effectively need to pay their negative balances off out of his own funds if Mt Gox is to be solvent. I think the biggest potential danger we face now is that the total negative balance is more than MT can pay.

"Sell" generally refers to selling BTC, with another currency as the base currency. While either way is technically correct, at this point it's just confusing to reverse the convention. If BTC becomes much more popular, maybe the convention will eventually change - but we aren't there yet by any means.

It would be easier to recognize authentic mtgox emails if their mail server were running on a host with a .mtgox.com domain name. If authentic emails come from a .mtgox.com server, spoofed emails would either have to come from a server that obviously doesn't have a .mtgox.com domain, or claim to come from the .mtgox.com domain but actually come from somewhere else. Gmail identifies the latter, and usually sends emails like that directly to "Spam" - it also often marks them as potentially phishing.

Whole Bitcoins are **irrelevant**. They can be *divided*. There is no special significance of 1 BTC. If 1 BTC were worth more than the GDP of the planet, do you know what problems that would cause? **None.** Have you even done basic research as to what Bitcoin is?
As for volatility, you do realize that Bitcoin is *only a year old, right*? **No one** is claiming that it's a mature currency. **It's not *supposed* to be a risk-free investment at this point**. It seems kind of early to be demanding stability from it. It has a market cap of ~35M. For an instrument of that size, it isn't even particularly volatile - [check out some stocks with a similar market cap](


How can you even say this? You have already made it abundantly clear that you are not vaguely familiar with *anything* that would be taught in a business school. It baffles me that you can lack an econ-101 level understanding of the subject, yet be so confident that everyone else is wrong.

MagicalTux has said all along that they never had a security problem - that a financial auditor's security was compromised, and since of course everyone gives their password list to their financial auditor, that caused a breach of one ginourmous account.

@_date: 2011-06-21 18:33:35
I don't think that what they did would have been what they would have done if they'd had write access to the database. It seems like what happened is fairly straightforward: the hashed passwords were leaked, someone went through the list unhashing passwords and checking the balances until they found one with a ridiculous balance, and they tried to cash it out.
Edit: actually, if someone had write access they could assign themselves X million btc and then crash the market to drastically increase the btc withdrawal limit. It seems to me a much better strategy would be to create new accounts, assign a few hundred btc to each, and quietly drain everything away before anyone knows anything is wrong - but clearly, and fortunately, that's not what they did.

Oh, but I can. By "not a real mail server", obviously I don't mean that they don't actually serve mail - I mean I could set up a server for their domain that is exactly as legitimate as theirs is, in about half an hour of fighting with my Postfix configuration. Maybe real mail server is the wrong term; I probably should have said *legitimate* mail server.
Obviously the best thing they could do is start signing their emails (and make sure everyone has their public key), but there are other measures that can also help in demonstrating authenticity that they are not doing, like sending their mail from a subdomain and using SPF. They have made no attempt to demonstrate the legitimacy of their emails.

Impossible. Yes, everything should be open source. No, there is no way to prove what is actually in the ram of a specific server at any time. This is good for allowing security testing, but it doesn't help with trusting the server.


(same as above)


This would be amazing, and is the only way to effectively implement much of this list.


Yes, definitely. It would be easy for exchanges to disclose where in the blockchain their funds are, preventing a run on the bank in the best case and cataclysmic fraud in the worst.


Not practical. It should be an option, though.




That would be a cool enhancement.

It's possible those things are fixed, but it is unlikely that the underlying problem has been. I can more or less forgive the plagiarized interface - that could have happened to anybody, right? But launching an exchange that rounds values internally indicates that:
- they are building their own system rather than using an established platform
- they don't know how to code financial systems
- they didn't test adequately before going live
- they initially responded poorly to important feedback

If a currency loses, say, 2% of its value in a year due to inflation, for most purposes that is equivalent to everyone losing 2% of their nominal cash assets, and that cash being given to the mint.

Definitely - people have mentioned two specific pages that supposedly had easily observable SQLis. If they actually thought it would be appropriate to send unsalted MD5 passwords to anyone who isn't a deeply-trusted computer, that would be more cause for concern than an SQL vulnerability.

Network effect! Reddit's open source, but it isn't crushed by clones – a newer exchange based on the same platform would not easily be competitive. Especially if you also keep some components private, in order to keep the advantage while still allowing openness for the most part.


I have very little experience with any lisps, but I've always wanted to learn…


I'd be more excited about working on the back end. I've been playing with writing a forex/options platform and market-making bots in python – I don't have anything spectacular implemented that would be worth porting to lisp or anything, but it's the part that caught my interest.
I also could work on the front end though. I have experience with JS, but I'm really rusty – I haven't done much in it since before jQuery became a thing. Generating SVGs in the backend for graphs, and then using the DOM to change display options in the frontend would be cool. And if you decide to use CoffeeScript for frontend components, I'd be all over that, too.

That sounds like the effects of *suddenly* putting a lot of coins "into savings". When the proportion of coins that are saved is fairly constant, people don't have to "notice" - the economy will easily take a constant factor into account - right?
@_date: 2011-06-17 09:02:37


I don't think so, and I certainly hope not. That would be like not accepting cash with certain serial numbers because it was at one point stolen. I don't think it's practical or desirable; the effect would be like having counterfeit currency in circulation - some people would not accept it but not everyone would check - it would be a nightmare.


What? No. That doesn't work for several reasons.
- A person with some of the stolen money likely isn't the person who stole it.
- Most exchanges don't require a "valid bank address" to deposit BTC - rotating coins through all possible exchanges (deposit BTC, buy USD, sell USD, withdraw BTC) would provide some measure of security in that tracking the coins would require all exchanges in the chain to have, find, and provide records of the applicable transactions.
- There are a lot of ways to make the final withdraw not linked to the original coins: withdraw to a dwolla account that doesn't have your real information; sell mtgoxusd on bitcoin-otc for paypal; you can probably do it with LR; hell, you could use virwox and buy SLL, and launder it through the linden markets.

That's my point. They need to get a real mailserver.
@_date: 2011-06-21 16:49:37
I think what MT was saying was that people who, during the time that is to be reverted, withdrew amounts that are greater than what they would have after the revert (if they hadn't withdrawn) will have a negative balance equal to the difference.
It does balance the books, but it can be assumed that accounts with negative balances will never receive the deposits necessary to become solvent - so MT needs to be able to cover the negative balances from his own funds as long as such accounts exist.

The FAQ makes it sound like deposited BTC are not touched at all - if this were the case, there would be no honest incentive for you to accept deposits.
Why would you say "There are many different ways we can generate interest for our account holders. Think outside the box." on the website, and then tell *us* what you're doing? I don't see the point in being sketchy and mysterious about your business model on the website if you're going to tell us how it works here.

@_date: 2011-04-03 17:48:34
Exactly. This is the main reason I trust that Bitcoin will always have some real value - there are places that are using it that wouldn't work with any other type of payment system. It is guaranteed by this mechanism to have some value, so it is "backed" by at lot more than almost any other currency - and the "legitimate" market can build on that.

Well I'm totally speculating because I own neither a botnet nor a large variety of mining rigs, but botnet computers tend to be useful for their total bandwidth / decentralizedness; I think it would be very unusual for a botnet to contain enough GPU power to be more profitable mining than DDoSing or something. I could see it being profitable to pick a few computers in a botnet with unusually high GPU power / bandwidth ratios and use those for mining, but I don't think it would ever be practical to devote a large proportion of a botnet to mining.

Also, if you'd like to reduce your exposure to the changing exchange rates between virtual currency X and your national currency Y, you could offer a futures contract on bitcoin-otc - you would effectively get a guaranteed exchange rate on X-to-Y, in return for the counterparty getting a risk premium. If your income in X is predictable, this would give you a predictable income in Y.

Blacklisting has many problems but I think this one could actually be solved fairly well: when X blacklisted coins are received into a wallet, that wallet's full funds are not blacklisted - just the "lowest" X coins of their balance. So someone following the blacklist would treat that wallet as if it had X less coins, and then reject any balance past that as invalid coins.

The official explanation is improbable, and probably worse than the truth. They claim that the password database got out because they gave it to some kind of auditor, yet users had identified SQL injection vulnerabilities that seem a more reasonable culprit.
They also made unfounded accusations about the Kevin guy who got lucky during this and then contacted MagicalTux and gave the BTC back.


*Most* passwords were salted.


I lost a few hundred dollars - apparently IP address, a 12 random printable char password, and dwolla ID aren't enough to prove ownership of my account.


Having SQL injection vulnerabilities doesn't mean they just need to realize that security is important and fix it - it means they have no idea how to make a website secure enough to handle this much money. Hopefully, they've hired someone who does. I haven't been hanging out on  so I don't know.

In my understanding, the thing about mybitcoin is that there's no way the operators can provide assurance that they aren't just waiting until the MBC float reaches a certain level to just cash out and take everything. There's no way they could prove they're legit – it's just the nature of that kind of system. A lot of people trust them enough to use their service, but there's a certain amount of risk. Personally I prefer to manage my own wallet. As long as you're careful about the security of your system and you backup adequately, there's almost no risk that way.

Either you meant to reply to a different comment, or we disagree on what constitutes jury rigging (I do not consider a system's natural behavior without explicit intervention to constitute jury-rigging) and on what Bitcoin is useful for (I do not consider lack of built-in blacklisting functionality to conflict with its use cases).

It's not always easy to transact in cash. In particular, online retail-type systems (where there are a lot of customers, as opposed to infrequent transactions between parties who already know each other) essentially require fast, reliable transfers... which cash in an envelope can't really accomplish. It's also much easier to send a large amount of BTC across a border through the intertubes than to smuggle a suitcase full of cash through customs.

I agree on all these points, but I would like to elaborate in particular on point 3's "goes to shit": it really does. The problem is that these coins are invalid to people who use whatever blacklist they're on (and who have a current enough version of the list), but valid to anyone else - so someone holding them just needs to find some sucker that will accept them for something, and then some innocent ordinary user is stuck with coins that they can only spend by finding another sucker.
Eventually, such chaos would resolve itself, I think - because the system would route around the inefficiency: professional sucker-finders would arise (fences/launderers) who would accept the dirty money, and pay in return nearly as much clean money (the blacklists would need to be nearly universal in order to substantially diminish the value). When that starts happening, the incentive to follow the blacklists decreases - the blacklisted money is closer and closer in value to non-blacklisted money - this is a feedback loop. So the presence of any non-negligible proportion of users who do not follow the blacklists makes it eventually become the most economical decision for each person not to follow the blacklists - and when that happens, following the blacklists would be insane, because the vast proportion of people using blacklisted coins would be innocent.
So for a blacklist to be sustainable it would need near universal acceptance, and I for one would vehemently protest putting something like that in the official client - per points 1 and 2 in r3m0t's post - what authority makes those decisions?
Edit edit: apparently I wasn't clear about this: **I AM ARGUING *AGAINST* BLACKLISTING**

In short, they can't. Converting Bitcoin to other currencies is the weak point; in an economy where BTC could be used "end-to-end", sales tax is no more enforceable for BTC transactions than it is for cash now.
@_date: 2011-05-11 07:04:38
I don't know how to say this nicely: economically, that is complete nonsense. Unequivocally, the supply of Bitcoins decreasing *increases* the value of everyone else's Bitcoins. I respect that you are thinking independently about this and not just going along with the herd – if more people were like that we could avoid a lot of bubbles and unnecessary crashes – but honestly it would save us all time if you'd skim a couple of Wikipedia articles on economics before going and making these kinds of claims.
The more people lose their wallets (effectively removing those coins from the economy), the more the real value of Bitcoin increases for people who can manage not to misplace them.
You can picture it like this: imagine for the sake of simplicity that the US cuts off all contact with rest of the world, and the only currency available is USD. Now image the mints all shut down. Over time, the remaining bills in circulation are decreasing. So a candy bar that costs $1 today is only going to cost $0.50 or so in 2 years - because when everyone has smaller quantities of money, smaller quantities of money are worth more. The real value of $1 is increasing over time, relative to candy bars. This makes USD a good investment: if you hoard a stash of dollars in good condition, you will have more value of USD when you eventually spend them.
It works much the same way with Bitcoin (except BTC can be divided into tiny fractions, so it can deflate by a preposterous amount before it becomes difficult to portion out reasonable quantities of value).
@_date: 2011-05-12 22:34:06
I'm not sure that applies here. As you have quoted,


AFAIK no government has defined a fixed exchange rate between their currency and BTC…
@_date: 2011-06-22 21:15:29
That's true. I suppose that comes down to a question of whether we want to be able to "reverse" some things (reverse the receiving half of a suspected illegitimate transaction), or whether we want the currency to have the properties that:
- all BTC are worth the same amount
- transactions cannot be undone
IMHO the world has enough PayPals and is in need of a cash-like online currency, so I favor the latter properties for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-05-07 19:38:30
Yes, that is true if there are enough people who don't care whether their profit is negative for those people to provide enough supply to keep the profit negative. So it may go below 0, but I don't think it will ever get far from it.

I know better than to assume market participants are rational actors, but it seems to me that if something has little or no use, over time people will become aware of that enough that its market value will decrease -- and since the reason the currency would be of little or no use in this hypothetical would be its deflation (right?), this provides a negative feedback loop, maintaining an equilibrium in which deflation cannot be high enough to substantially decrease usability of the currency.


Assuming you mean inflate/deflate the other way around, if I understand you correctly you are saying "if Bitcoin is eventually worth almost nothing, its market price will decrease to almost nothing". Well, I can't argue with you there.

In general I agree with that, but I'd just like to point out that even though the price now is largely speculative, it's also possible for the "real value" to catch up to the market value. That said, I think we're safer if it doesn't go up so fast right now.

Individuals generally pay taxes once or four times a year (in the US, anyway); companies generally need to pay sales tax to the government monthly to quarterly, depending on volume. I don't think that's a huge burden for the individuals or the companies. If BTC were displacing tax-currencies in earnest, the companies and employees that already specialize in doing all the tax-related work would take care of this, and would only have to do a very small amount more work.


If I'm paying taxes on BTC, in a country with tax-currency X, my taxes are based on my profits denominated in X, right? So when BTC is strong against X, the taxable amount in X is higher, and the BTC are worth more of X in the same proportion, right?


Wouldn't it be easiest for business which already use foreign currencies to use a different non-local currency?

Well, my point is that if it's opt-in, somehow nearly everyone would need to opt in to it for it to be effective; otherwise, people who know they have dirty money will just clean it for a small fee, people who don't realize they have dirty money have to go through a lot of extra trouble, and people who continue to opt in to the blacklist eventually realize they're not hurting anyone who isn't innocent.
@_date: 2011-05-19 15:24:26


Yes, that is my point.


So you're saying that Bitcoin will flounder because it will have very high value and very low volume, right? I'm not an expert, but I don't see how that could be among the possible failure modes of any kind of instrument. If Bitcoin trade volume becomes so low that Bitcoins aren't very useful, Bitcoin's value will decrease. If Bitcoin's value is decreasing, there will be people who want to sell them.

There are a lot of ways to secure a wallet that take &lt; 30s and are probably safer than entrusting it to someone with a poor track record. You could stick a wallet on a thumbdrive so you can only deposit to it, and keep it somewhere safe - a safe deposit box, if it's a large amount.

It's a good point - some of BTC's unique properties are quite well-suited to certain types of illicit transaction.

I suspect MBC has a good deal more than a couple thousand BTC right now. there are 6,200,700 BTC in existence as I write this, so if MBC has 6,000 they have 0.1% of extant coins – which still seems quite low to me.
Surely in most countries it would be a strong case for some sort of fraud – I'm guessing the fact that people have paid normal currencies to acquire them resolves any question as to whether Bitcoin is of value. I don't know how the value of the property stolen would be determined, but since BTC has a clearly defined market value I'd think that might be involved.
MBC is operated out of Nevis, in the Caribbean. I don't know anything about the political environment of Nevis, but even if extradition from there to the major countries from which people have stored Bitcoin with MBC is easy, with enough money you can disappear from anywhere… And starting on one Caribbean island and retiring on a neighboring one with a new name seems all too easy to count on the legal system guaranteeing the legitimacy of MBC – at least for me.
Of course, in all probability nothing like that is going to happen. I'm just saying I think it's not more safe than a carefully-managed wallet file.

It's basic supply and demand - since the capacity to mine is widespread, the profit for miners will always tend to be positive but very small. When the supply exceeds the demand enough that the profit is negative, enough people will stop mining that it goes back up. When the demand exceeds the supply enough that profits are high, more people will start and people already mining will increase the amount they mine, reducing profits.
