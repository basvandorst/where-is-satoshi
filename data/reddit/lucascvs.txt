English people: This is really believeable in France, period.
En l'absence totale de législation concernant Bitcoin en France pour le moment, toute cette procédure était bidon. Dans quel but, je n'en ai aucune idée, mais un recours doit être possible.

(I know, this isn't really relevant, but it made me laugh yesterday, and I thought some of you could laugh as well.) Have a nice Sunday anyway!

Thanks for the laugh at the start of my day !

Rue des Petits Champs, I don't recall the number. But that's not where I ate. If you take this street and turn left to "Rue Chabanais", you can eat at "The Hokkaido". Ridiculously cheap and big servings, tastes really great. Assuming you don't mind to wait in the line, and the kitchen in the restaurant room doesn't bother you.
(For what it's worth, it has been awarded "5th best ramen place of Paris", but everything is great, I couldn't finish my dish. For 8-11€, service included).
P.S: Always tip!

Without being sure which side I'm on, thanks for the laugh mate.

The first ever real-life bitcoin transaction was 2 pizzas for 10000 BTC.

About the required ID: I personnally don't care, there are ways to unlink my purchase and my bitcoins. I'll Just send them to myself, and the address I bought with won't be a problem.Yes, fees are high.But 10% is lower than localbitcoins. I could even but at La Maison and sell higher at localbitcoins. (which I won't, nobody ain't got time fo dat).My next phone, answering to someone, would be under Android. I was kinda Android, but wanted to give WP8 a try.

Please excuse my misunderstanding, but what's the deal with chargebacks in the U.S?Are those operations easy to do because you can have your card copied at anytime?Or is there a kind of insurance?I just don't get how you can legitimately say "look ma, I'll just say I didn't got the item", and be refunded by your bank without further investigation.Here in France, it would cost me €17 to cancel a transaction (and the card associated with), unless I declare having been mugged or robbed.Is it because you have swipe cards and we got pin ones? Or just in your bank contracts? How do you reverse a transaction, by speaking with your banker or by saying your card was stolen? Are you not supposed to sign tickets ? (I'm not sure of this, we don't do this)Thanks to anyone who will take time to explain this to a fellow European!

Disclaimer: this is highly simplified, aka an "ELI5".
"Someone", aka an individual or a group of people just attempted to sell 30,000 coins below market price, at $300 each. So, until the USD 9m that those coins represents are eaten (bought by other people), price can't go up. Also, many merchants started to accept bitcoin IRL, but instantly sell the coins for USD, this creates sell pressure, but buying volume doesn't grow as fast.

It's "blanchiment" as when you take your clothes to the dry-cleaner, to be exact ! Kinda fun .

La maison du Bitcoin just rocks, I drop by everytime I'm in Paris, these guys know how to deal with press and image, and know their topic.

I couldn't be happier to get a dozen coins if it plunges to two digits (: .

My EU bank change fees are just awful. I think last time I went to the counter, they were buying at 1,21 and selling at 1,39 to their customers (including me) for the dollar/euro ratio.

I'll have some free time to subtitle this video this week, even though my English isn't perfect, I think I'm able to write a simple &amp; short translation.

You're right, it's good for me. But also to anybody wanting to have Btc in Paris, or, more than that, information about bitcoin.You know, when you see online that another new startup opens and deals with btc, you can't know if they are competent. But I checked, and these guys know what they're talking about, really.

Your apple wouldn't become brown anymore due to oxydation.

I have some German abilities (lived in France near the border), like, to understand written and slowly-spoken German. So, your website doesn't scare me at first glance. But I see the problem more as a design problem than as an UX problem. There isn't a ton of work to do on graphic design on your site, but just the little bit that will make me go from "This site is maybe a good way to buy Bitcoins from Germany" to "This site is clearly the way to buy BTC in germany".
You should X-Post to &amp; to get a more detailed review, unfortunately I don't have a lot of time right now..
Also, sorry for all the jokes about the fact your website is in German.

I bought them from a person, they gave me the choice between a paper wallet ( generated by a piper device), or sending them to an existing address. They also have a one-way ATM, but it was disabled today (there was only one guy for everybody because of summer holidays). Still, the atm is useable without providing an ID the rest of the year.They plan to add BIP0038 to their paper wallets, but no date was given.There are also miners, not running when I visited, but when every employee is there, everything runs !EDIT: I took the paper wallet, since I'm using a WP8 phone :(

You could really have your website improved IMO, there are a couple of problems that a redesign &amp; some configuration could fix.
Feel free to PM me for details!
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:57:39
This idea is great.
I think i'll be allowed, after the speech, to do such an experience. Maybe ask everyone interested to bring a computer -mostly graphic designers =&gt; mostly mac users, so, what would you recommend me to use as a light wallet? I'm already using electrum under windows, or bitcoin-qt when i'm on my desktop-, to do a little practice after my speech.

If I were you, I wouldn't print the paper wallet with a printer. You could silkscreen it on acid free paper, which can last 18 years without a doubt with black ink, or laser-engrave it on some steel or 3mm acrylic sheet. Because you can't take the risk to use advertised "archival ink" if you're not 100% sure it will nail it.

On my mobile, and don't have time to get the pubkey to check, so I don't get where was the joke, if someone can detail this?
