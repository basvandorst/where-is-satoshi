Yeah, but every day, several times, you are posting ads for your work on r/bitcoin etc. As far as I'm aware that's not what the sub is for. If everyone selling a bitcoin related product did this it would become a shit show.

I already conceded on that point (which is not classed as ridicule anyway) when you explained that it was a charity drive, not a bitcoin adoption drive.  You're extremely sensitive to even minor criticism,  did you not go through the ringer of art school or what?

I've sent a carrier pigeon with your request over to fontase in Belize, all your problems will soon be over. 
Feel free to close the ticket, thanks for contacting the neckbeard only utopian commune.

It's a bit far fetched to expect adoption of bitcoin in Venezuela. The vast majority of the population barely have access to basic food and water security, let alone digital devices and I.T literacy. Noble idea - flawed fundamentals.

Sounds as if your mental health is suffering as a result of the loss (all the conspiracy stuff etc.). You should find someone to talk to so that you process the stages of grief faster, accept the situation, and have some support with it. Otherwise you risk further psychological deterioration, paranoia, and development of mental illness.
Without sounding too blunt, your decisions were emotional-based, primarily greed, and this was your downfall. If you really cared about the money benefiting humanity you would have never gambled with it.

Ok, fair point, I thought it would was about promoting adoption to counter their currency issues.
I missed the part where anything I said was ridicule, I think you're wrong there.
It's not that I don't like your art at all, it's not bad. I just object to what is borderline spamming marketing material for free, basically advertising, on a subreddit that is largely unrelated to what you are selling. Anyway, I've made my point and you're misrepresenting and dramatising it, so I won't be replying again.

r/bitcoin is not a free advertising platform. You should pay for Reddit ads, getting a bit fed up seeing them on my feed all the time.

WTF are you on about?
I said that r/bitcoin shouldn't be used for a free advertising/marketing platform. If you interpret that as quoted above then I don't know what to tell you.
