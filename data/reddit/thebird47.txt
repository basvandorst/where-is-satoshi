Can one address have more than two outputs in 1 transaction?
@_date: 2015-06-05 17:58:26
I hate when people use a chrome extension that changes words on a webpage and then become confused by it.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:38:48
To clarify: A transaction can have many inputs like this  
  
Can they have many outputs too? 
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:45:38
Why do people keep saying this? What is the reference?
Please no sandstorm...
@_date: 2015-06-20 06:42:55
Older coins have higher priority? How old do they need to be?
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:41:31
How can I check the amount of BTC in an address on my own pc if I have the blockchain downloaded?
@_date: 2015-06-20 06:34:50
What is it then?
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:21:04
He mentions every person being able to guess 1 Billion times a day.
I would love to know a real number:  
I have an i5 2500k and a AMD 7950. How many *actually* guesses can I make a day?
How many can google make a day?
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:03:57
So its like wikileaks and then posted to the blockchain? 
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:09:49
Okay. So I just set up skype and I shared the screen. That works well if you want.
Otherwise lets say I have the python host email bird with the password 123, and I want to send an rss feed to duck
Lets say [this]( is the rss feed i want to send to duck taken from [this]( classified. 
Where do I put in the two emails and the password. I know there is stuff with smpt but I don't know where to put everything and how to run the program.
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:25:08
Alright how does this work?  
A guy in a video above said it would take ~5000x our current storage capabilities to calculate.  
Does the site just look at the url and generate a little list to show you what that page *would* look like if it *were* the full ledger?
@_date: 2014-12-26 21:11:43
Maybe the real story is the comments and discussion about the topic. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:46:09
Very cool! Good luck!
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:48:28
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:40:42
So where is the 10K transaction?
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:40:11
I watched this for about a minute and a half before I realized I had no idea what he was saying.  
Guess it's just one of those days.
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:23:12
Wouldn't 6 confirmations be fine like everything else?
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:22:52
You shouldn't be giving beer to a ~~miner~~ minor.
@_date: 2015-05-09 17:55:45
Yeah.. Anyone ELI10?

Edit: whoops, I thought you meant from them being cracked.
@_date: 2016-06-01 00:19:02
Andreas... plz.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:25:22
PGP is proprietary and closed source. GPG is what you should be referring to.

I work for a startup that wire transfers tens of thousands of dollars to china for their orders. How could they transfer this much money with bitcoin and pay less than $50 in market price/fees/etc?
They pay about $50 to do a wire transfer.
@_date: 2015-07-18 16:39:58
I've been with that sub since the second drawing. I always hate coments like "Congratulations! Sent $25.42 via paypal." First off he could be making that all up and second it was sent back to him anyways. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 22:46:07
Didn't know BTC went back up to 290!
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:18:46
Just because the thumbnail made me curious.
Rubiks Cubes have the following number of possibilities&gt;  
    43,252,003,274,489,856,000 
Vs possible BTC addresses&gt;
    1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976

So glad the one at overstock.com headquarters is not like that.
@_date: 2015-04-06 22:32:49
Where do you buy a donut for $0.35?
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:01:05
Are they all in 1 address?
@_date: 2015-09-14 18:37:13
Human error. Not Bitcoins. 
If you generate and hold your private keys correctly then you won't be loosing the bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:33:43
I don't see why everyone is freaking out about this address more than any other one except for vanity purposes.  
This one is just as secure as any other address you correctly generate.
@_date: 2015-09-14 18:25:12
People paid him money and then let him keep the private keys. So one day he transferred all those private keys he held to somewhere else.
If YOU OWN AND HOLD the private keys then it is impossible for them to get stollen.
@_date: 2015-04-09 06:02:38
You mean there is a non-USA country?
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:30:55
With over 370,000 BTC I'm sure they will be fine ;)  
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:59:02
I get that no one has the private keys but you're just as likely to generate 15HCzh8AoKRnTWMtmgAsT9TKUPrQ6oh9HQ as you are for any other address including the one in the op.
I guess everyone is freaking out about how hard it would be to crack but it's just as difficult as any other address.

I dream of the day that a restaurant prints a qr code on the receipt and I can just pay the bill right there.
@_date: 2015-09-28 17:25:20
 Restaurants  already run on trust in their customers like this. If I get a $17 bill I'll often just leave a $20 and walk out.
@_date: 2015-09-14 20:01:30
You are right! And in this case someone gave their dollars to someone else and he took off with them. 
It's a much better idea to keep your own cash than to give it to someone who has no guarantee to give it back to you which is what happened in this case.
@_date: 2015-09-15 15:58:36
What are your thoughts on bip 100 &amp; 101?
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:56:10
What's Satoshi's stash?
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:14:57
Why? Whats wrong with GPG signatures?
@_date: 2015-03-03 22:19:11
I live in Salt Lake. What can I do to fuel these flames? 
@_date: 2015-03-14 05:45:27
With all due respect; one of the most obvious safety features seams like it should be pretty high up on the To Do list don't you think?
$1 Thanks for your work! :)
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:42:44
I don't get it. Shouldn't I need to put a deposit address in if I win?
@_date: 2016-07-10 07:22:26
What is your favorite alternative?
@_date: 2016-07-01 14:49:11
How did he lose that much?
