Looking for help.  We are launching a new hardware based bitcoin wallet, with unprecedented levels of security @ bitstash.com, whats the best way for us to get the word out about what we are doing?
@_date: 2014-12-08 07:48:58
mojoiama, we get it, thats ok. So take a look again in the summer when hopefully freely available. We hope that some would support bringing a project like this to market, but thats not for everyone, we understand
@_date: 2014-12-10 15:49:21
:) all relative right
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:38:37
I did not delete any comments. If you use the CAPTCHA approach, the keylogger can capture the password all it likes, but no use without the current valid OTP, which is generated for each request. Keylogger can capture an OLD OTP, but that is no good for another transaction. BOTH OTP and PASSWORD needed. 
I personally hate captcha's and find them difficult to read sometimes, and ours is no different, a pain. But enabling 2 factor with the phone works great. I get a message on my phone with the transaction details and need to confirm the transaction by entering my password. Works great. Very secure.

yeah, and I thinking the US govt will start heavily buying Bitcoin later this week, to make it more attractive to russians and drive the ruble down further. :)

Hmm, ok, so bitstash is a bluetooth enabled, desktop device. It sits plugged in continuously, with a 6 hour backup battery. If the desktop, or mobile apps are open and connected it will communicate with them. Certainly when a user is handing out a new BIP32 address, it is likely to be connected, and can preprocess TX when its received by the desktop and passed to it over the interface. Of course this may not always be so, but when the desktop / mobile apps check their balance on our SPV wallet, this tells them what Txs they need to sync with the bitstash the next time they are connected. It works pretty good. Now that said, certainly very very large transactions are challenging if not in the cache when you go to sign a TX, but as I said, it works pretty well
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:12:24
Well, we can certainly host an AMA once the word is out and people have questions. The critical thing is...how to get the word out. We think we have A solution. We think our solution is an option for those looking to secure their Bitcoin. We think we solve for mobile spending, home/checking and long term savings in cold storage. We sure have spent a lot of money. We would love to turn you into an evangelist. Take a look at what we are doing. Ask us questions. Help us get this important innovation some air time.

@_date: 2014-12-16 10:02:51
I assume you mean bandwidth, because that is indeed a tough one, especially over bluetooth, when compared with USB. But there is a solution to fast transactions even with UTXOs from large transactions , if you add some storage to the hardware device, and pre process TXs ahead of time, when you receive them, as opposed to when you need to spend them. So now you have the UTXO value, and the TX hashes cached, and can verify spending UTXOs vert quickly.
@_date: 2014-09-24 19:18:03
And if multisig is part of your use case requirements, i.e. corporate dollars etc, then I can almost guarantee that those environments would love to have a FIPS 140-2 level 3 certified HSM like BitStash holding the keys for each signer, so have total and absolute security. Either way, there is a place in the ecosystem for a solution like ours. It solves a real problem in a way that no other solution to date does.

@_date: 2014-12-10 22:35:25
So coinbase claims to have [1.8mm users]( and its a pain in the neck to sign up there, so they cannot be doing that to hold just like $100, right? Then you have circle, then all the exchanges, including the mega exchanges in Asia, gotta be another 2mm users in those groups combined, one would think. Plus there must be some estimates, real ones out there that support the likes of blockchain closing 30mm in funding.
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:51:04


I think that statement is patently incorrect. Why would I require someone to look at a small cheap screen when they have a beautiful retina display on their phone available to display things in a manner that is easy to read, understand, showing transaction details, amount in BTC/mBTC plus current amount in their preferred currency of choice ( 100+ currencies supported ).
Having 3 devices, the initiating desktop, the BitStash and the 2nd factor device coordinate, all of which must have the correct authorization with each other, all of which can prove their identities to each other, all of which must agree to the transaction is as secure, if not arguably more secure, and certainly an awful lot easier to use. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 01:24:04
svener, 
that sucks, sorry, any suggestions ?
@_date: 2014-12-11 12:31:43
:) sure but the currency app needs distribution apps, places where it fits better and makes more sense than its competition, credit cards. One could argue that XBox is one of those, with a demographic of users who generally do not have credit cards, and as such, maybe a large ready made potential user base. Facebook would likewise be an App under that model, and aptly so, in much the same way that changetip is referred to as an app for Bitcoin.

So when my wife is shopping in our Bitcoin future world, me or her friends are needed to co sign her transactions. I think not. Sure, extremely important in corporate environments, but not at home, not in retail POS refund situations. Great tech, but not the solution in many cases.

I am going to Create an FAQ on our website, and will post questions asked here on with answers there, so accessible to everyone. Again, thanks for the questions. If you think we may be on the right track, please help us get the word out.
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:06:18
Thanks for the constructive feedback. So our goal was to create a solution that was simple to use. Simple enough for non technical folks used to using to paying with PayPal or checking out on Amazon to use. To do software only based multi sig with different devices you need a coordinating service/device. BitStash performs that role here, and our process makes this level of security accessible to all, seamlessly. 
We hope what we are doing resonates with others. We think it makes sense, and that it could be an important inflection point to make Bitcoin more secure, for everyone, globally, the banked and the unbanked.
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:06:06
We have a cert on the device to check the signature of the response we get. The entropy is requested from random.org by the client device, pushed into BitStash, and verified on the BitStash before use, using the cert

@_date: 2014-12-07 02:58:00
Hey dskloet, no thats not possible, for a couple of reasons
1) Mobile apps are signed and verified when executed. Here is a primer on IOS code signing verification  So at least on a NON Jailbroken phone, IOS apps cannot be modified in the way you describe. The story with android phones has not been so good, but the last major vulnerabilities found (masterKey and Fastboot ) were patched in April 2014, and are fully rolled out to new phones. Obviously the situation is different on desktops, especially windows, which is why all this 2FA guff has to be done in the first place.
2) As I said in the prior post, point 1. All messages to / from BitStash are signed and verified. This signature independently verifies the sending application and the content of the message. The signing key is AES encrypted with the users PIN PBKDF2 extended 2000 rounds. So while malware could potentially script our desktop UI, for instance on Windows, or cause a BIP70 payment protocol click ( the biggest threat we think ) it cannot programmatically create a transaction to send to BitStash via code. So what is on both screens is what is being requested.
Not sure if you understand ProtocolBuffer definitions, but this is how the txSign message looks
message iSignTxRequest {
	extend InMessage {
    	optional iSignTxRequest iSignTxRequest = 105; // Unique extension number
	}
	required OTPassword otp = 1;
	required string accountId = 2;
	required txNetwork network = 3;
	repeated txClaim claims = 4;
	repeated txOutput outputs = 5;
	optional string pinHash = 6;
	optional string passwordHash = 7;
	optional string captchaCode = 8;
	optional string colorCaptcha = 9;
with embedded OTP message containing
message OTPassword {
	required string password = 1;
	required uint32 counter = 2;
	required string binHashHex = 3;
This buffer is signed by the client device and the signature &amp; contents verified by BitStash
@_date: 2014-09-25 12:42:07
Yes you can do that. Of course. And what we have done is made exactly that, simple, automated and secure, so that everyone in the world can accomplish the same level of security without having to have your deep knowledge and background.
In addition using our device, in such a process, secures your signing keys, so that they cannot be stolen and cracked and used.
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:24:04
Its never boring here on At least we have that
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:52:15
Hey Aussie. We do have a POS solution in the works, on the same hardware, you can see the slot for the HDMI output on the PCB. The POS solution adds HDMI for QRCode payments and a custom designed NFC antennae for NFC payments. We can also do Bluetooth payments. We also have a really cool remittance solution, that can really only be done with hardware, whereby a user can create what is in effect a hosted multi-sig address at a remittance agent, unlock-able by someone else with a regular mobile phone, totally secure, blockchain op_return solution. 
We did have all these SKUS on the check out page, but were told it was too confusing and to focus on one for now. So thats where its at.
Anyways, there are ideas and then execution. When I put the design together I tried to address a number of markets, all with security needs. Now I have to execute, and as I am sure you are aware, thats not as easy. I do not mean the software, which of course is challenging enough, but getting mind share is incredibly difficult.
@_date: 2014-12-16 07:54:57
Thx for feedback. The device will ship with initial list of certs, and follow a signed cert update process.
The list is long, but I believe all of these points are necessary to deliver a consumer grade solution. Its hard to fault the Trezor from a security perspective, other than maybe their recovery process and the lack of BIP70 support. But from a usability perspective, its hard to see my mom using it, or other non tech folk. Its my belief, that for bitcoin to have the potential for mass adoption, it must be accessible to everyone. So I think a simpler setup process is needed, a simpler PIN entry process, a fool proof backup and recovery process etc.
Our software will be open sourced in late January, assuming I stay on track.
@_date: 2014-12-11 12:59:51
Yeah, makes sense. I have a couple of wonderful kids who love minecraft, so I finally broke down and bought them a xbox live membership so they could hang out with their friends. Ridiculous process to sign up, credit card info, cell phone info, 2 factor authentication what a mess. Bitcoin would clear that whole situation right up.
@_date: 2014-09-30 03:55:49
"Tinfoil hat paranoid individuals may not want to setup/initialize BitStash with their everyday computer. They may want to use a never online airgapped machine. I tried to initialise my Trezor with a never online Piper (raspberry pi). To me this is rather like creating a cold paper wallet on a never online airgapped machine, vs turning off wifi on your day-to-day computer "
BitStash is AIRGAPPED. The only things brought from the outside is entropy from a TRUSTED SOURCE, which is used as Just that entropy, noise, It is the seed, it seeds the seed. Hey look 3 seeds. Maybe we should roll one. I thought the mods here were supposed to understand this kinda of thing. This is a far more secure approach than using RNG developed by the blackhat squad at the NSA.

thx, although much the same info as coin cadence post. I was trying to get at Peoples estimates for the number of people. So obviously on the blockchain its less than the 422k addresses, as many will have multiple addresses. BUT, it does not really take into account those with circle &amp; coinbase accounts, whose balances are likely held in the vendors cold storage wallet, or those with overnight balances with exchanges that are for the most part off blockchain too right? 
@_date: 2014-09-30 03:08:24

@_date: 2014-09-24 06:18:07


How is that off topic? Blockchain.info gets exposed for a major security flaw, only the largest number of wallets in the ecosystem..there is a problem, we believe we have some or all of the solution. I would think for those reading the thread, highly relevant? But again, maybe we need the newbie instruction guide to r/bitcoin. Is there such a thing?
@_date: 2014-12-10 16:02:44
Hey, great clarification, the only comment I might make is where you state "In order to be safe, "k" needs to be selected as a non-predictable value". This is of course correct, but could be confused by the casual reader, as we often talk about generating k in a deterministic/predictable way, in order to ensure the same k is never re-used. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:43:52

@_date: 2014-12-09 08:16:15
thanks much AussieHash.
@_date: 2014-12-10 15:48:26
So the use of BIP32 wallets promotes the use of unique addresses for each transaction, and therefore reduces the chance of the problem occurring. That was the point I was trying to make there. Using BIP32 with a signature whose k is non deterministic has risks if the BIP32 address is reused, for instance if you use it to play satoshiDice, where winnings are retuned to the sending address. So best to combine BIP32 with a deterministic k generator, like that proposed in RFC 6979. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:32:41
Yeah, the BIP38 password, would be nice to solve that.
We actually get the entropy for seed generation from Random.org, in a signed transaction, which I think is pretty good. We mix it using pbkdf2 with an RNG generated seed to get our HD wallet Seed.
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:04:23


Yeah, no need to play, one of us has no money
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:12:43
and the points I have made to dskloet in another part of this thread, reduce those risks significantly. (is there a way to reference an existing comment in a new one ). PS, we have a point of sale system designed on the same platform for late 2015 that adds an HDMI port. That plus some SPI inputs, could add a touch screen display to BitStash if really wanted. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:30:27
Hardware based desktop companion, bluetooth access. Designed to be FIPS 140-2 level 3 compliant. BIP32 wallets, BIP70 payment protocol. Great wallet software, accessible from mobile and desktop devices, with true COLD STORAGE. Anti tamper, self destruct features. Ultra secure.
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:17:34
Yeah, you live and learn, was trying to get the community interested ahead of the release. I guess we know better now.
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:48:28
Sorry, hard to answer all these, Reddit blocks me from replying too quickly. I guess we are still in Timeout. Anyways. The Device initializes itself when the customer first set its up, not at the factory, but at the customer site. The client device, that is doing the configuring, a desktop, a phone etc, feeds it entropy from Random.org. That entropy is shuffled using a mersenne twister, standard stuff. But the shuffle is important in case Random.org is somehow compromised. Then we slice off some of that entropy, 64 bytes, and use it plus a 128bit PRNG seed to do a PBKDF2  extension and generate the actual random seed. 
To us, this seems the most secure approach. We do not control the seeds, Random.org does not control them, and no one but the device ever sees it. Its all offline.  We choose not to let customers choose their own mnemonic because in the end, that too is not secure, and we want something that you just plug in and use, something my mom can use.
There are three private keys ( in a one account scenario )
1 is a mobile key, and gets generated in the device but sent to the mobile device ( PBKDF2 extended PIN encrypted ) so that you can have balance on your phone and spend it when you are out and about
2) is a device or home key. Its generated on the device and stays on the device ( PBKDF2 extended PASSWORD encrypted ). It allows you to spend when connected to BitStash over Bluetooth, from your mobile, desktop etc.
3) is a Cold Storage key. Its generated on the device but persisted ( PBKDF2 extended PASSWORD encrypted ) on the LUKS encrypted USB stick. The USB stick needs to be plugged in, needs to be mounted ( LUKS open ) and the key decrypted with password to order to sign a transaction. BitStash has a built in 6 hour battery, that facilitates you taking your BitStash to your Bank Vault, so that together with your phone/laptop, you can move balance from cold storage to device/home storage.
There is no SD card, just eMMC chip
To pay for coffee at a Startbucks you would not have YOUR bitstash with you. You would have your mobile balance on your mobile device.

@_date: 2014-09-24 18:12:16
In addition, we have a true COLD storage wallet, stored doubly encrypted on a USB drive. The first level of encryption is on the drive itself, fully LUKS encrypted. The second level of encryption is the data &amp; keys, which is encrypted with the Users password, PDFDF2 extended for 2k iterations. To spend from the COLD storage wallet, not only do all the other conditions need to exist, device authentication, signing, OPT, 2FA, but the COLD STORAGE stick needs to be physically plugged in to BitStash. In addition BitStash has a backup battery that lasts for 6 hours. Allowing you to take you BitStash to your bank vault, along with your phone, plug the cold storage stick, move some money to the device wallet. All without compromising the security of the COLD STORAGE. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:55:44
*Currently you have to confirm every OUTPUT of a transaction you're trying to send to (which is usually just one*
So our experience differs somewhat, as my typical transactions almost always entail 2 or more utxos. I receive a large payment in, then spend many small payments, and end up with lots of change addresses, that by the end of the month need to be combined to make payments. So I hit this road block more often maybe. BIP70 does nothing to change validation of UTXOs ( unless I am missing something ). It allows you to validate to whom you are sending. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 23:21:18
Yeah, thats true, and to your point most of the money has come from a small circle of VC investors that buy the potential of Bitcoin. So I will grant you that. I guess the point I was really trying to make is saying the sky is falling or that the end of Bitcoin is nigh, ignores the fact that huge investment has been made, and that while that investment will take time to generate its solutions that add value to Bitcoin, it is unlikely for them to get scared out their position because the price of Bitcoin is falling today. Those investments are made with 5 to 10 year horizons, and so people investing in Bitcoin's Price, should have a similar time horizon for their return. And WHOA thats alot of karma ! Nicely done
@_date: 2014-12-04 08:04:57
Maybe, its doable for sure. So the concept of using the Big Screen on your cell phone does not cut it for the 2FA? Also considered using he NFC foe 2FA, confirm details on phone screen, tap on device to complete.
@_date: 2014-12-17 06:37:23

@_date: 2014-12-16 08:20:26
Riplin, just my humble opinion, and hopefully my mom does not read this, but my mom can use email, she can use the internet. She cannot read a screen that size, or do the PIN transposing, or set up a trezor, or spell the word mnemonic :), or store it safely, or use any of the wallets like electrum that are in existence. She's not dumb, just an average person, and eventually, just like the browser, for bitcoin to work, she HAS to be able to use it.
I think also there is a real issue when transactions are spending multiple UTXOs, each of which have to be validated. Trezor has to do these one at a time and it makes the work flow horrible, or at least not the same as say checking out on Amazon, or using PayPal. People just storing Bitcoin on it don't notice it, but if like me you pay for hosting in bitcoin, advertising and media in bitcoin, some payroll in bitcoin, you will see these issues. Again. I am not knocking Trezor, I just think somethings can be improved.
With respect to Apple's secure element, yes, for mobile wallets I agree entirely. But, I cannot tell you how many times I have lost my phone. I need a secure backup and I need a solution where I do not expose my transactions to a third party service.

@_date: 2014-09-30 03:39:58
Yeah maybe right :) Listen skepticism is fine, I get it, but the insinuation that I have re-boxed a Raspi B and am a clueless moron will not hold up to the light of day. We have done some homework, a lot of work and spent a fair bit of money. Our board is custom designed by some folks with outstanding skills who have built things for NATO and the US ARMY. The quality of their work is outstanding. We also have a retail point of sale device on the same basic platform with NFC, designed also. The FIPS certification is terribly expensive, so a path to do all at once is needed. If the community says CIRCLE and other online storage solutions are the only approach, then we do not have a winner. But for everyone in Latin America, Asia, Russia and indeed here in the USA that does not feel comfortable with that, there must be an easy to use solution. Something that makes using Bitcoin as simple as PAYPAL. Thats the goal. Yeah we are bound to have fucked something up, missed something, etc. But the community will find it, certainly the FIPS certification will find it. Help us get the word out on the KickStarter. Help us bring this to market. Help us improve it.

hey, thanks thats awesome. Found this guy complaining about some bitcoin he bought at 620. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:05:42
I guess I am just not a good communicator. 
"How is it possible to retrieve entropy from random.org on an offline client device that is airgapped and has never connected to the internet"
The entropy is pushed from the client device ( phone, desktop ) to the BitStash device on setup over bluetooth. The client device can talk to internet, obviously to check balances and send raw tx. The BitStash device obviously cannot. 
Yeah, why not indeed. Because we wanted a solution that allowed you to keep large balances secure at home in an air gap device, but allowed seamless payment for home shopping, bill paying, trading etc. Being able to manage it from any device mobile, desktop etc. Of course you still need to leave the house and you could always use a completely different wallet. But making it easy to set limits on much you had on mobile and being prompted to TOP up, or having the mobile be able to use Device keys in a BIP70 payment receipt scenario, just made sense to US. I want to be able to get given large sums of money when I am out and about, just not have them at risk. 3 tiers of secure storage. Related but separated. All BIP32 hardened accounts from the same SEED. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 01:18:22
Sorry for late reply, just seeing this now.
I will try and answer this in a way that addresses all the potential issues.
1) All messages to the device must be signed by an authenticated client device, signing keys distributed on setup
2)All messages to the device contain an embedded HMAC based "one time use password" to prevent message replay scenarios
3)All messages are defined as Protocol buffer messages
4)A signTX message to the device does not contain a hex serialized transaction generated by the client, but rather a specification of claims ( utxos ) and outputs, as well as password hashes, and potentially user typed captcha solutions and color captcha solution.
5)If only a single device is registered with BitStash, the BitStash device generates a random 4 digit captcha code, generates a captcha image, and sends it to the client device as a base64 encoded image over the signed, encrypted bluetooth connection. In addition it generates 9 color codes, which are displayed as the color captcha, and displays one of them on its LED ring. To complete a transaction in this mode, the user must enter their password, solve the 4 digit captcha, and choose one of the 9 colors that most closely matches the color the LED is displaying. Importantly the BitStash device generates a new Captcha code and color captcha every 15 secs, with the UI indicating to the user when its about to time out.
6)If the single device registered is an IOS 8 device, then the user can configure security, such that IOS8 touchID fingerprint can be used in lieu of the captcha code.
7) NOW TO YOUR QUESTION, here is the process as currently designed
In the case that multiple devices are registered with BitStash, the user can configure BitStash to require the second device participate in authenticating the transaction. So in the case of a desktop driven transaction the User would be prompted on their mobile device to confirm the transaction. Here is how it works
7a) The user initiates a transaction from their desktop/laptop/iPad as normal. However, the 4 Digit Captcha is not displayed as normal on the desktop, instead the transaction details are shown on the mobile device, they confirm the details by pressing ok, and a 4 Digit Captcha code is displayed. They enter that code on the desktop application in the dialog displayed, along with their password. Now, importantly, in this mode, the initiating device will never be sent a signed transaction to relay to the network, instead the transaction is always relayed to the network from the BitStash device through the second/mobile device. 
In the case that the mobile device is an IOS 8 device, with a fingerprint reader, the user can simplify 2 FA, and this is OUR preferred approach for simplicity, modifying this process, as follows
7b) The user initiates a transaction from their desktop/laptop/iPad and enters their password. The transaction details are shown on the mobile device, they confirm the details by pressing using the IOS8 fingerprint reader, and the transaction is signed by BitStash and relayed to the network from the BitStash device through the mobile device. 
All that said, we have a lot of flexibility here and would be delighted to incorporate feedback

It may go to 240. It may go sub 100. No one understands what's driving the sell off, so no one knows where it ends up. But what we can say is that over $350 million has been invested by VCs on this little project. They are not all wrong. Someone with a respected voice in the community needs to explain Bitcoins's advantages for consumer protection to the regulators. Merchants fighting over Apple Pay and CurrentC need to be educated on why Bitcoin is the real answer. Yes, there is much to be done, but Bitcoin is still at the starting gate. Buy in the 200s.

Or was it, as I suspect, mind blown by reading white paper, this is some cool shit and gonna be worth a fortune someday. Cause if its the later, not the former, then what difference does today's price make? If you read it, and understand it, there is only one conclusion.

But BitStash's COLD STORAGE KEY is true cold storage. You store it somewhere safe, like a safe deposit box. Today, I have a wallet with dollars in it, a checking account and a savings account. Now I have the same model for Bitcoin with BitStash. A mobile wallet, some money not lots, a home/device wallet ( checking  ) and a cold storage wallet( savings ). I will be posting app screen shots on the website in a few days. Maybe it will be clearer then.
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:27:24
Yes. You are right. If someone puts a GUN to your head and makes you enter your password, you are in trouble. Of course you can hit the SELF DESTRUCT button, burning the eMMC, and requiring the GUN toting dude to force you to take him to your bank vault, dig out the cold storage key with backup, buy a NEW bitstash, insert the key....etc etc.. sure can happen, but not as likely.
PS we love MultiSig and you can enable multi sig transactions with BitStash too, but...not required to secure your Bitcoin and no need for a third party to prevent access to your coin.
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:34:43
3 tiers of secure storage, include the only TRUE cold storage for consumers using dedicated USB port designed to be BadUSB firmware immune. Anti tamper self destruct circuitry protects you from device tampering &amp; theft. 6 hour backup battery allow you to take your bitstash to your bank and do cold storage transaction while in the vault. 1 year full sleep mode protects against tamper for 1 whole year while unplugged. Full backup on LUKS encrypted USB drives. Cheaper than the cost of a checking account for 1 year.
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:47:57
Yeah, ball busters for sure! But its fine. We think that with large companies rushing to control your bitcoin, as the banks do today, some people will gravitate to, and support initiatives that attempt to solve for the problem of securing bitcoin for yourself. Afterall, thats at the heart of Bitcoin, and unless we fight for it, it will be lost.
We hope the community of mods and others look past their obvious cynicism and do a deeper dive into what we are doing. No its not a mobile device, thats what your phone is for.

I do not think you will find anyone, me included, that would argue TREZOR's cryptography is not first class. It is, and their work to simplify the code base, and reduce external dependencies is outstanding.  They were also one of the first, if not the first to release RFC 6979 compliant signatures. So all in fantastic. But, I would make an argument against its ease of use, for main stream users. For Bitcoin to gain mass adoption and be usable by the general population, it just needs to be simpler to use. That is no reflection on the underlying engine's complexity, just on how thats exposed to the user.

Sure there is a point. But this has happened time and again in history. During the gold rush out west, only a few hit it big, everyone else wasted all their money time and effort. Those that got there first got the best claims. Same in the land rush across america. Same in the grab for internet domain names. A lot of luck &amp; timing and some sense of when something matters makes a lot of people / early adopters rich. Thats the way the world works. If you bought sub $10, in size, you did extraordinarily well. But so did those that bought Apple in September 2000 at a split adjusted $13 a share.

whys that?
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:28:20
Hi dskloet
thanks for the input &amp; interest and the hint on code formatting in reddit. Sunday here, so a little slow to respond.
In my earlier response I was specifically referring to IOS and Android provisioning, code signing and app signature verification processes, which check the signature of an app and verify it and its code match before running it. This not the same as saying that malware apps could not be installed on a phone and do malicious things but it does say that the app is unmodified from what its signature says. Sandboxing protects one App from another, so malware apps cannot in theory attack another running app ( that maybe an ongoing battle depending on APIS leveraged ). 
Now, lets take the most recent IOS malware as examples. WireLurker &amp; Masque. A pretty big wakeup call for Apple, but in practice not that dangerous. Both require the theft and use of an enterprise provisioning profile to work. Something thats just not that easy to get a hold of.
Wirelurker has the ability to load malicious apps via USB from OSX, if the user was dumb enough to download an OSX app from non apple App store. Its a pretty sophisticated attack, and is a big risk to data stored on the iPhone thats accessible to all apps over APIs, like contacts for example. But it cannot impersonate our APP, or extract data from our secure store. I also believe this particular door has been closed.
Now the Masque attack in theory is EXACTLY the situation you are concerned about. In this case a url distributed through a phi-sing attack could download and install a replacement APP for one already installed using the same bundle identifier. This requires an enterprise provisioning certificate, but while it can replace a legitimate app with a pretender, the app still needs to be signed, and the signature is still verified when the app starts.
Some good reads on these two issues are here.
Neither of these situations are dangerous to BitStash or the funds it secures, or can be used to perform the attack you describe, because, we have our own provisioning, signing &amp; verification process on both the desktop app, mobile app and indeed the device itself, when the app is authorized initially with BitStash. The code is, hashed and the result sent to the BitStash with every signed message as part of the OTPassword. It makes App updates more cumbersome, but guarantees security. So a Masque impersonator would just not produce the right hash, and as such would not be able to send / receive messages to/from BitStash.
dskloet,  In reality, the problem we are trying to solve for is malware automated draining of a wallet. Our 2FA approach solves for this, by requiring a HUMAN enter a code displayed on one device, into another much like a WebWallet like GreenAddress , we just have the added benefit of an additional physical COLOR CAPTCHA and verification of transaction details on another device.
dskloet, last point. I know enough to know, there is much I do not know. I think we have an incredibly easy to use and secure solution, especially in the IOS8 fingerprint 2fa use case, its just easy, yet totally secure.  But I would be delighted to incorporate community feedback, guidance and direction. There is no Screen on BitStash, or Buttons, because I wanted a workflow that was familiar to users, that fit within the expectations of the average person used to using PayPal or checking out on Amazon, that competed with the workflow of a coinbase, blockchain.info, greeenAddress, but did not have the risks associated with using a third party. 
Let me know if there are any other questions I can answer for you.

@_date: 2014-09-24 17:59:52
The shared secret is stored encrypted by the user's PIN on the device. So yes, in the case you have a KEYLOGGER installed, there is the possibility that someone automates your desktop, and attempts a transaction. The OTP must validate with the device, so they would need to modify our source code to cause the generation of the correct one at the correct time, but certainly not out of the realm of possibility. For that reason, and for the same reason that TREZOR requires a button press, we strongly suggest 2 factor authentication. We chose a device that people are already comfortable with using, their phone/iPad etc. We think it makes the process simple to use, easy to understand. I cannot imagine my wife, or mum or dad using a Trezor successfully.

Scary stuff.  is releasing a new product next month. Its going to address Bitcoin security once and for all. Its going to be very exciting. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 07:21:48
Two things caused the problem
No BIP32 wallets on Blockchain.io, so private key data leaked on each use. 
Then bad random number generator ( browser javascript ) lead to weak signature on transaction, reusing a k value from prior signature using the same key.
These two combined meant that the private key could be derived from the transactions and the coins taken. The guy that lifted the coins has a script that watches all transactions for this exact problem, and promptly taught blockchain a lesson. The fact that he returned the coins, a significant amount, shows his goal is strengthening the ecosystem. He is to be applauded.
The Solution is to use only BIP32 wallets, only use an address once, &amp; throw it away when spent. Additionally use a wallet that uses a deterministic approach to k generation, a random number used in the ECDSA signature, which would prevent the possibility of k reuse. A accepted solution to deterministic k generation is RFC 6979.
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:00:41
Sure. No screen. We have developed a hardened bluetooth protocol, with diffie hillman key agreement driving additional AES encryption, message signing and embedded HMAC OTP ( one time passwords ), to ensure only authenticated devices can connect to BitStash. In addition, all BIP32 keys are stored on BitStash encrypted with the user's password ( after 2,000 rounds of PDFDF2 extension ) , so rebalancing prompts the authenticated device for the password, to perform the transaction. 
There is no screen, everything happens via your mobile or desktop app. The embedded HMAC OTP ( using a secret shared on device authorization ) plus the user password ensures authentication. If you authorize multiple devices, you have the option of specifying 2 factor authentication, so an attempt to spend on the desktop for instance would require password entry on your phone. With a single device, the HMAC OTP can be set as a CAPTCHA, requiring human input to decode and enter.
The entire device is built to meet the FIPS 140-2 level 3 requirements. So all our BIP32 elliptic curve algos, software, hardened bluetooth, device anti-tamper circuitry, will be certified to meet that standard, at a cost of about 100k, not including our time. 
We are trying to solve bitcoin key security once and for all. Hopefully others find out approach useful. Plug it in. Download the apps. Done.

Thanks again for your interest and offers to help test.
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:22:14
If the core Bitcoin network changes in such a way that the standard scriptPubKey OP_CHECKSIG or P2SH scripts are not supported, then, yes your BitStash will be obsolete. So thats just bound to happen over time as crypto currencies evolve. But, we think upgrading to a new one, like we do with iPhones and computers over time, is not a bad thing, and again we  hope the price point is low enough to make that feasible. Its all a Trade Off, today saw CIRCLE opening their service to the entire market. A great day for Bitcoin Adoption, no doubt, and one which everyone in the community should applaud. But, we want to manage and control our Bitcoin. We do not like the concept of a company controlling it, a company that may be subpoenaed, or coerced into freezing balances, a company that requires a lot of personal information in return for secure storage.  So we think there is room and should be a demand for both approaches. We obviously hope we are correct in that assumption, and leave it to the community to help find support for the alternate path of true currency independence.

Friend, your timing has obviously not been great. Not sure there is anyone to point the finger at there. Certainly I do not remember telling you to buy. If you have lost faith in the future of the technology, then stop buying every week. No one can tell you why its going down right now, and no one can tell you for sure it will ever recover. I think it will, but I know squat. So buy, sell, do what you think is right. Personally I remember thinking how lucky everyone that bought in the 200s were. Maybe I will get that chance soon, maybe even in the 100s. Who knows. But I know this, the technology is game changing. The currency and the tech cannot be separated. I think long term its a winner. Is that 1 year, 3 years as Tim Draper said, 10 years, 20 years. I do not know. Look how long the telephone took to gain mass adoption, then TV, then the internet. All these took decades. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:58:38

@_date: 2014-12-08 00:31:27
better, I guess its possible, happy to take feedback ideas. We have some use cases we are thinking about for remittance payment refunds using nlocktime transactions where we save the transaction for later. So its all possible. Just need to direction 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:34:03
Sorry, maybe we are talking cross purposes. One of the challenges in signing a transaction is making sure the UTXOs that are being used have the value you have been told they have. The device has to prove this for itself by hashing the originating transaction and comparing the hash to the the new outpoint hash being constructed. All the device needs is a map of hash to value. This is quite easily done well ahead of when the UTXO maybe spent in a TX and can be looked up at that time. Of course, maybe not always there, but a cache hit often enough to make TX signing fast. Complicated it is not, at least not in comparison to everything being implemented.
@_date: 2014-09-25 01:25:46
No it cannot. Multisig still leaves those keys open and accessible, encrypted maybe, but still open to be cracked at will once stolen and then used. MultiSig needs a secure solution for storing the keys to enable it. In addition MultiSig requires some service to coordinate the multi-sig process. As I said from the beginning, this is something we can do with our Device, as coordinator or in concert with other multi-sig operators. But it does not relegate the usefulness of our device in either case, and again, the reason we built it was to make transactions easy and seamless. Not complicated and difficult.
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:52:19

@_date: 2014-09-29 20:03:16
Software is planned to be open sourced. Hardware decision has not been made yet. Thats a decision the investors need to buy into. But, the FIPS certification process and eventual FIPS Certification will produce an enormous amount of paperwork etc. So if we open source it, it should be very well documented. The OS is a modified linux, with a stripped down kernel. For instance no USB HID support, or ethernet support. All firmware &amp; software is signed. OS update process ( if any ) is not nailed down, it introduces many risks and may break FIPS certification. So we will know what we are allowed to do there once we go through that process.
OpenSSL is leveraged, as is the BlueZ stack, so possible issues with unknown bugs in there. USB circuitry is isolated, and only mass storage devices are supported. The USBs are encrypted &amp; signed so only valid ones can be used. BAD USB will not affect it, as no HID or ethernet support in the kernel.
Random entropy is fed into the device from the client software from Random.org. The entropy is shuffled, then some of it sliced off. That piece is then mixed with a 128 bit PRNG generated seed and PBKDF2 extended to produce a totally random BIP32 seed. 
The USB port, the power port and the bluetooth protocol are the attack points. Other than physical tampering/access. The Bluetooth protocol being the most vulnerable and dangerous, given its range. We have spent a lot of time designing solutions to the vulnerabilities, and the FIPS certification and open sourcing are the only ways to prove that we have hardened these successfully. 
Before the device is first configured, but when powered on, it is susceptible to a denial of service attack over bluetooth, but there is nothing at risk, and no information to be gained. Someone could just stop you from accessing it, or configure it for themselves if they can physically see the LED, in which case you would not be able to access it. Software on the device is signed, so client software can be sure it is communicating with a BitStash and not something else waiting for your Bitcoins in the next apartment. 
The messaging protocol over bluetooth is implemented over RFComm &amp; Gatt with a Protocol Buffer defined message payload, further encrypted using AES following per connection Diffie Hillman key Exchange. All transaction and configuration messages are signed by the sender and verified by the receiver. Each message contains an embedded HMAC OTP, to prevent message replay. The device can only respond to these predefined messages. Others are rejected. An authenticated device could be driven by malware. We have 3 solutions to the malware issue. 1) Visible LEDs on the device are part of the transaction signing process in a unique color captcha. 2) 2 factor authentication using a second authenticated device, requiring manual entering of 2 factor code shown on one device into second device and 3) Auto sleep and or self destruct on multiple invalid messages, OTPs, passwords, captchas etc. 
Is there more to do, almost certainly, most likely. And we will work hard to incorporate the feedback and knowledge of the community. The goal is to create a user experience your mom or dad could use, while being very secure. 
Our KickStarter is designed to validate the demand for such a device. How many people are there in the world that want to manage their Bitcoin securely in an easy to use way without a third party in the middle? If there is enough people we can do the appropriate certifications and bring this to market.

Anyways the goal is to give the same ease of use as an online wallet, like blockchain, without the risks or requirements of a third party, both operationally and as importantly, from a privacy perspective. Our wallet is a BIP37 SPV blockchain client, so it has the benefit of privacy, of not leaking every transaction you do, like a greenAddress for instance.

Dear friend. I am afraid you might be a little confused. If you read the whitepaper, as you say, and understood it, then you should realize the potential for bitcoin's future. I got involved around the same time you did, and have bought bitcoin in the 600s as well as right here. When people talk about the fact that the blockchain is interesting but the currency not so much, they clearly do not understand the equation. The blockchain and the currency are inseparable, hence, in time, as the blockchain finds uses, the currency will rise. When will that be, I have no idea. I can say, looking at the charts that the 200s look likely, maybe even as low as 220, no one can tell. But as Warren Buffet once said, "when its raining gold, hold out a bucket". The future is not written, but this technology has extraordinary importance. There are 7 billion people in the world, and only 21 million bitcoin. Give it 5 years, and lets reconnect then.

There must be a better way to handle this type of Q/A. Is there? Because its kinda tiring to have to keep up with the so called Gotcha's, but then be blocked by the "you are doing that too much"
Anyways, they are hardened Keys from the same Master Node. Not derived from each other. The scenario does not apply, as I am sure you are aware, If they were derived from each other there would be a problem, NOT when they are each hardened directly from the master. BIP32 is a good read for sure.  Account zero is cold, account 1 is device, account 2 is mobile, which is the only one at risk and could just as easily be created from a Whole different seed, also backed on the USB, if thats what we wanted to do.
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:30:51
PS, just to make clear. A major reason for the device is to avoid having to use MultiSig with some other third party just to get security. Do you want your Bitcoin to be inaccessible because the startup you used for third party multi-sig fails? Or has its assets are seized or it is forced to freeze your assets? Bitcoin was designed to not require trusted third parties. We are trying to ensure keys can be kept securely, while maintaining that promise.

A principled stand that should be applauded. One wonders how the core tenets of Bitcoin, no trust, no third parties and anonymity, got lost so quickly in the race to create the next generation of banks. Consumer protection should be at the core of every government's responsibilities to its citizens. The data security crisis as evidenced by the hacking at JP Morgan, Target &amp; Home Depot and everyone else, can only be solved by solutions that do not require consumers to leave themselves open to identity theft every time they go shopping. Bitcoin is the clear answer, and the regulators in charge of consumer protection need to be shown how it solves the problem.

If I peel away the sentiment generated by your timing, and cut to the meat of your post, which is "people just do not care about it", then I might offer this. 
Bitcoin is curently too hard to get, to hard to use, and to hard to secure. So its not yet primetime ready. When those problems are solved, see  then mass consumer adoption can begin, and over time build. 
If merchants, who have lots of incentive to use bitcoin, offer discounts and rewards for Bitcoin use, and consumers have a simple, safe and easy way to store and spend it, then the combination will gain significant adoption, because its just not every day a merchant figures out how to increases his margin by 3%.

I assume the negative karma is not a good thing ? So now we have this thread, and we have tried to answer the questions that come in to the best of our abilities. Are we stuck in "idiot prison" forever with this thread, or is there a way for us to dig out of the hole, and make this thread a constructive place for people to learn about what we are doing, the problems we address and why we think everyone should be made aware of it.
@_date: 2014-09-25 01:35:58
Again, I disagree. You are suggesting that both devices are compromised simultaneously and controlled simultaneously, which while certainly possible, is the same issue that multi-sig faces, and all other 2 factor authentication faces, banks face etc. Our solution allows you to manage the appropriate balances with the appropriate risk, and keeping LARGE balances on the cold storage drive, prevents any and all such issues. Happy to discuss this constructively, but there is just no way that global consumers are going to use a trezor to execute transactions while shopping online.

Its important to remember the utility of Bitcoin in times like this. They cannot put the genie back in the bottle. Price action short term always hard to predict, but very hard to doubt the long term value. So I look at this as an opportunity, and if it gets back into the 200s, which it, might, it will be a gift. The 250 million VCs have invested in Bitcoin will ensure its long term acceptance. It just solves too many problems and enables too many things to not be successful.

Seem to remember hearing about prohibition in the 1920s here in the USA. Did that stem the flow of alcohol? No, and this Russian ban will have little affect on Bitcoin either. Its disappointing, especially if you are Russian, but it cannot stop the tidal wave of freedom and change that Bitcoin is bringing.

Sure you know this already, but here goes ELI5
* Your bitcoin is secured by your private keys. 
* If someone steals your keys they can steal your bitcoin
* Malware on your computer can log your keystrokes
* Malware on your computer can decrypt locally stored keys and steal your bitcoin
* Malware on your computer can fake the bitcoin address you think you are sending to and redirect somewhere else and steal your bitcoin
* Malware on your computer can fake the amount being spent versus how much change you are getting and drain your bitcoin to miners fees
Online services with 2 factor authentication &amp; multi-sig can be used to solve this, BUT they leak privacy info, and bitcoin address info, can be shut down by govts or regulators, or just plain go out of business
So how to keep bitcoin safe, well you could go out an buy another computer and follow this procedure 
Or, if you care about your privacy and security you can buy a hardware wallet like BitStash to solve the problem.

@_date: 2014-09-30 01:11:28
Yes, no way to fix zero day vulnerabilities. But BitStash is not expensive, or at least will not be when mass produced. All your balances on all wallets are backed up on cold storage keys, and the device cannot spend your coin without the transaction being initiated by a client device, with password, OTP, signatures etc etc. So worse case you buy another and reinitialize with the cold storage keys.
It supports multi-sig, time lock and any BIP32 compatible coin. The coin parameters are pushed from the client on wallet creation and key signing. The challenge to supporting new coins isn't the key creation and signing but the network support, which is on the device client or in the cloud. Out of the box it supports Bitcoin, Litecoin &amp; Doge. With demand and time we can add others, or other people can

@_date: 2014-09-24 13:36:03
Sorry for delay, EST time here, so was late at night. 
Ok, there are four components used to prevent this issue.
One,  each bluetooth message must be signed by an authorized device. BitStash generates a deviceId and a public private key key for each device authorized. Messages must be signed with the appropriate private key to be accepted.  
So not any device can talk to BitStash, only those that have been authorized by the user.
Two, BitStash generates a unique shared secret for each authorized device. The shared secret is used to generate a HMAC OTP, one time use password. A message must contain the correct generated OTP to be accepted. It must be signed. So the combination prevents message replay for being allowed.
The Shared Secret and Signing Key are encrypted on BitStash using the user's 4 digit PIN, chosen along with password on setup, and sent to the authorized client device on setup. The PIN is needed to unlock./open the application and access these variables. The happens when the user opens our Applications. The PIN is also used on mobile devices for spending from the mobile wallet, as their private keys are stored encrypted on the mobile device with that PIN ( PDFDF2 extended 2k rounds ). 
Three, all transaction signing messages must include the PASSWORD, THE OTP and the SIGNATURE, plus the correct deviceId. The actual keys are stored encrypted on the device, and the PASSWORD is needed to decrypt them.
WITHOUT all three pieces it is not possible to sign a transaction. 
To prevent keylogger software installed on the CLIENT from capturing a user's password, two additional features can be enabled. First the HMAC OTP can be set as a CAPTCHA. This means a human must read it and type it into the field. 
Second 2factor authentication can be used, where a second authorized device is used. Unlike other 2factor authentication schemes, this does not involve a text message or third party, but that the second device be physically in range of the bitStash, paired with it and then the user simply uses that device to enter the password when prompted. In BIP70 payment scenario, the user would click the BIP70 payment link on the merchant site, and then complete simply by entering their password when prompted on their phone. Pretty seamless, and less work than existing 2factor solutions.
These settings are stored on BitStash, so cannot be changed without a user's password
Finally, BitStash is set to go into a sleep mode after 3 invalid password/pin attempts. This means it will accept no transactions for a configurable period of time after three attempts. In addition repeated continuous entry into sleep mode can cause BitStash to self destruct, frying the eMMc. 
So, if you are afraid of a compromised computer with a keylogger, set 2 factor authentication. Then executing a transaction is a simple as entering your password on your phone when prompted. (You will have needed the PIN to unlock the application, but will not need to enter a password on the first client device in this case ).
As far as what the device accomplishes, other than just software. All the keys are generated in the device, as hardened BIP32 keys from a core seed, which itself is generated from atmospheric noise based entropy mixed with a PRNG seed and then PDFDF2 extended. With the exception of the hardened mobile signing key, the keys never leave the device. The device cannot be compromised either through its Bluetooth or USB interfaces and if tampered with, will destroy the keys. So, the device is true secure storage for those keys. Unique BIP32 address are generated for each receiving transaction using the extended hardened public key shared with each authorized device. The device also stores off blockchain information, like notes on transactions, BIP70 payment information etc, and keeps authorized devices in sync with each other when in range.
Yes, using multi-sig transactions, which can be done with BitStash also, with a third party in the middle is a solution to this. And for some financial entities a solution like BitStash plus multisig will be needed ( competing FIPS certified HSMs ( hardware security modules ) cost upwards of 50k ), but for those of us that are NOT comfortable with a third party Standing in the way of us spending our money, either because of a business continuity issue, or some Court Ordered action, BitStash provides the first truly secure way to seamlessly store Bitcoin. No paper wallets, no dongles, accessible from mobile and desktop devices alike.

DIfferent motivations right, they used the money to build devices, then mined for themselves, then sent them to customers once the difficulty level rose. No such incentives in our model, just the usual sell enough or go out of business pressures.
@_date: 2014-09-25 12:47:51
Actually, no, we want to build a device that makes bitcoin finally secure enough to drive global adoption rates higher. There is nothing, other than the FIPS certification, that we are doing that cannot be done with an offline computer and some knowledge of how Bitcoin works. But that does not make them equivalent. Taking a complex, error prone, multi step process and making it so simple my mom could use it. Simple, easy to use, totally secure. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:38:09
Does it NOT worry anyone else that all these online wallet solutions see every transaction you do? GreenAddress has a whole bunch of other issues as well, with constant management of nlocktime transactions. Must be a better way

I understand your position entirely, but the terminology is just being used much more broadly, see [Pantera Capital's]( use of the term re change tip. So its in that context I used the term. Anyways, whatever the definition nice to see an expansion of merchants accepting bitcoin. Maybe kids will be able to buy &amp; sell their virtual goods on xBox games and take out real bitcoin eventually.

Enter to win at 
It has a 6 hour battery, after which it enters a low power mode. It can stay in low power mode for 1 full year before depleting battery entirely. If you get the anti tamper self destruct model, at that point it will self destruct, frying the eMMc with a second battery used just for that purpose. You can fully recover your wallets and coins using your backup cold storage stick to a new BitStash. FIPS certification requires the device cannot be comprised, by any means. Or course if you do not need these features, you can buy BitStash without them or disable them.

The term HD wallet refers to Hierarchical Deterministic wallets, such as in those defined by BIP32  They produce keys using elliptic curve cryptography in a deterministic(repeatable) fashion from a secret seed as opposed to the random key generation used in Bitcoin core. Given the seed, the Nth keys can be generated by the algorithm and it will be the same every time. This has benefits such as being able to backup an entire chain of keys with a single seed. The Hierarchical part of the HD creates multiple independent chains of keys from the same seed, which is useful in delegating keys for different roles without sharing the entire wallet and removing the risks that entails. 
A hardware wallet refers to a physical piece of Hardware that leverages some key generation scheme, such as BIP32 or random, and keeps the private keys ( and seed in the case of BIP32 HD Wallets ) secure within the hardware device. Hardware wallets are designed to protect the security of keys. It must be noted that key generation itself is a point of significant security risk, that must be addressed for a hardware wallet to be worthwhile. Sources of entropy( random data) for Key / Seed generation need to be truly random. So when using a Hardware wallet, HD or otherwise, how they source entropy is critical. See this recent article for the risks  In addition, when using BIP32 compliant HD wallets there are risks that need to be addressed, see  so it is critical that Hardened keys to be used as the root of each independent chain

Its 90mm tall, 56mm wide. Format was chosen so as make the LEDs easily visible across a room. We could have done something lower &amp; square, but we liked this format its different, plus we get an increase in Bluetooth range ( antennae is at the top ). We are building a device capable of being certified to FIPS 140-2 level 3 or 4 Standard. That certification process is very in depth, detailed and a long process both for hardware and software. Certification will cost us almost 100K. The device will be available without anti-tamper features for those that do not need them, but the evolving financial services infrastructure for Bitcoin will need a FIPS certified HSM at is core. Its a real product. Coming to KickStarter Oct 22nd.

I got prompted by one of our engineers to point out that the OS &amp; firmware is initially loaded via the micro USB power port. Then a PIN header is pulled, making that process impossible ever again. So if there was to be a way or a need to update the firmware, it would need to be rethought.

BitStash allows you securely spend Bitcoin from your deaktop/mobile/latop. There is a mobile wallet, designed to carry a small balance, for which the keys are on the mobile device. But at home or in the workplace, spending from the BitStash itself can be done when in range with any of those devices. So if like us, you are sitting on the sofa shopping on overtstock with your new iPhone 6, being able to complete the transaction without getting up makes sense. The LEDs are used as a Color Captcha. So being able to see them is important. (yes there are accessible options for the color impaired ). There is also 2 factor authentication, without SMS infrastructure. We have tried to build a solution that works across the world, at home, at an office, as part of the new financial services infrastructure, in a retail store. Thats the vision. To make keeping and spending Bitcoin easier and more secure for everyone. And of course as a fall back plan, to have a nifty night light !

With respect to the device being capable of being disassembled, not in its production form, no. The device will be available without anti tamper &amp; self destruct circuitry for those who do not need them, but the case is the same in either version and is not designed to be openable. However, we will make the device hardware and the case available to those looking to do a review if our KickStarter is successful and we can produce them at scale. Currently the cases cost $1300 each so we are not sending them out. But we can produce them on mass for about 1.50 each so will have plenty to go around then once we are given the green light. Its about a 7 week lead time from ordering mold to production cases, which would have put us in December, not a good time for KickStarter style campaign.
We figure it will be 6 months from KickStarter to first devices ready to ship, FCC certification the critical path. And 9 months or so before the first FIPS certified devices will ship, its just a long process there, not much we can do. But that gives this community and others plenty of time to review and comment and improve what we are trying to do here.
