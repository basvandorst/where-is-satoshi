Unsubstantiated opinions.

Yet cryptocurrency is stolen all the time. This argument is like saying banks are safe because they use best practices to encrypt data transmissions, when in fact it's empirically easy to hack a pc that has a saved bank password or a bitcoin wallet. It's also unlikely to succeed in using quantum teleportation to enter a safe but that's only one very impractical channel for theft.

That's a great simile, and a practical explanation. I like it!
Yes, you are removing the requirement to trust an outside party. Again, in the practical view, we trust individuals and companies all the time, often with things more important than our money (ie, lawyers and doctors may be trusted with our freedom and our health respectively). With a banker, you're exchanging your trust (and some fees) for services, such as security, insurance, borrowing, transfers, and so on. What I like about Bitcoin is previously there was no competing digital money storage service. Both Bitcoin and Bank coin will likely be better as a result of this competition.

To avoid the hassle, I skipped my weekly injection of $CAD because of this.

Where did you find out about this?

Its just semantics but if you don't own bitcoins, they can't be stolen, and taking someone's bitcoin wouldn't be illegal. The latter is clearly not the case.

Not sure why you're being downvoted either.

It may be a small amount, but that's kind of the point. Tips are often insignificant in size to both the giver and recipient, but when someone does something large and altruistic for the community, the nickels can add up!

Not sure, but given a recent Canadian policy change is the problem, it seems likely that there exists a country without the restriction. Relatively few countries have mandated crypt accounting as of yet.

I use it in Canada by linking an RBC USD account. (I realize this is by essentially tricking Coinbase into thinking you're from the US, but it works)
