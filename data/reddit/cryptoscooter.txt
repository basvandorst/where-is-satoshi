Few months ago.. Moon = 10k
Now 11k is considered a panic inducing, bear market, REKT dipped, FUD manipulated market. 
As someone who got in in 2016, I'll say what we ALL have been saying ALL along. HODL and watch it pick up again.

yeah, no.  I used to think BTC was propped up by tether, but not after I started using it for its intended purpose. 
during the btc 20k surge, tether was being printed because people were taking positions OUT OF BTC and into tether for the inevitable BTC dump (nothing moonshots forever, dammnit). Everytime I saw millions of tether being printed I saw millions of BTC coming out. I find a stronger correlation to that scenario rather than yours; which you think tether propped up BTC price. This is no way true because printing 1 billion tethers printed doesn't reflect the 100+ billion market cap that poured into BTC in December. 
in January ( but mostly last 2 weeks) Tether was being printed in mass during this period because MANY (I myself included) took positions out of BTC during the 15k mark when I saw every sign that BTC was heading into a strong bear market. This is why tether was being printed. People took positions out of BTC and placed it into tether. 
I don't hold any more tether at the moment because I got back into BTC. The bottom has been reached and BTC will start going up in mid February, as it did every year for the past 4 years. 
The only bad thing about tether is it's being printed from a shady exchange with a bad history (bittfinex) thats backed by a mickey mouse filipino bank. they're going to always refuse a formal audit. they don't want to reveal how they're trying to recoup some of the lost BTC they lost in their last hack. it's not necessarily intentional scamming but it's not necessarily the best practice.

Yes they have a shit ton of BTC. 
god only knows how much $$ they're making from trading fee's. 
every exchange (with exception to decentralized ones, which i'm a big fan of) holds loads of btc. every exchange does. are you asking if bitfinex holding BTC towards USDT is any different than GDX holding BTC towards USD? 
USD is created out of thin air. When you borrow money a bank creates USD and you get the debt obligation to pay that back. But where did the USD come from. Thin air. So how are you going to back USDT with something USD that is created out of thin air. 
As for the CME. Even the gold bugs hate futures because that’s what prices gold. There is 12x more ounces of gold sold through futures than what exist. So yes futures is a scam to. everything is a scam. 
ps: get into 0x (ZRX) while you can. decentralized exchanges are the future.

If i'm not mistaken, I see tether printing has subsided and with much lower volume. This is an indicator that bitcoin will rise again. 
Tether is issued when because people take positions into it, it doesn't have anything to do with propping up the price. 
You saw tether being issued to hold up the price. I saw tether (in real time) printed when the price went from 13k to 11-12k because people took positions into it (this does not refelct tether holding up BTC). Then I saw people buying back into BTC at 10k. 
It's literally not enough tether to even drive up the BTC price that much, trust me.  With all the tether in the world hitting just 1 market at once (which never happens), then it may have enough influence to move bitcoin up from 11,000 to 11,600 before it'll correct back down to 11,400 after 24hrs.

I use bitcoin to buy alt coins to buy back more bitcoins.

100 dollars in [insert tech company being traded] is NOT the same as 100 dollars in BTC in 2010
you're comparing a 100 million dollar powerball winner to a winning scratch ticket. 
I've only been into crypto since 2015 and even though my stop loss hit last week (sold 25%) I'm still up 30,000% from my initial investment (which isn't hard to do, I would grade myself below average). 
I took my emotion out of the game (something we don't talk on here a lot about) while people like you are on here complaining about how it's all doom and gloom because you missed out :) 
I'm still keeping the majority of my crypto in because I believe in it, more than I do in USD. Mostly because USD is backed by oil and and Saudi's oil industry (aramco) just broke the deal that Kissinger made decades ago where they agreed to receive US protection as long as aramco sold crude in USD only (forcing other countries to buy USD). 
Well guess what? no more. China just bought crude in yuan. No more deal. Have you been reading up on the Saudi family situation?
