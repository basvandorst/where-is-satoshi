Does this mean you aren't going to restock after the last have sold? In terms of offering a competing service alongside Steam/Bitpay - I know sometimes Best Buy and Ebay sell for discounted rates of 80-90%.

I could not find an option to send in BTC format.
edit: completely missed it, its the green "button" saying USD. and i cant withdraw 1 cent as there is a minimum limit - "Must be greater than 0.00005460 BTC"

Here's a mirror:

Since it only supports US banks atm, I tried to withdraw all $10, however the btc price went down slightly and I could not select all of it as there were 'too many decimals'. Nor could I select an amount to send in btc - only USD to 2 d.p. I could only withdraw $9.99 and was left with 0.00001971 BTC in the account.

Thanks, I used two different colours and did the 4's and 0's first, then the 3 corners then yeah it's basically like minesweeper from thereon.

Thanks, much appreciated! Good luck with the recovery! :)

Yes, correct, this would match exactly 1 of the characters between [ and ], and %in is a single digit, lower or uppercase letter, and %S is the dollar sign $.

One of the text files it is reading from is not in utf-8 format, giving that error. Try this fix:

Awesome thanks, please can you send to: 1B6gCUmwJvVVpreqfQH3zu19cEa2TFQ76D
I'm not completely familiar with the tool/script, but I can take a look now for you.

Thanks, that was fun. Here's the solution, done in mspaint, I found that if you zoom out it makes it easier to scan:

Same, I got a message from 


Why can new users send mass pms??
@_date: 2016-01-31 22:46:08
Then maybe a suggestion for RES - block pm's from new users or those without a verified email.
@_date: 2016-01-21 08:21:22
Disabling pm's from new accounts would be a start.

Lol it was from him, you're on sreaka's list  at least someone is following through on their word.

Done, thanks for the chance!

Found it very interesting, thanks for sharing. There is some overlap with this article:  I wish there was an app that showed QR code metadata like dimensions, error correction level, a useful tool would make recovery and solving puzzles like this a bit easier.

Congrats, thanks for the explanation. I didn't have time to look at this today, and i doubt i would have got it either if i did! :)

Mine is 200GB vs 11.8GB. No complaints about the size though, however the time it takes to load/scan the blockchain and time to download it from a new install is prohibitively slow. Furthermore the blockchain has heavy reads and must be stored on an SSD, whilst the tv can be archived on an external hard drive.
