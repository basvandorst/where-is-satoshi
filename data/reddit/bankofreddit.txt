I'm interested in your source for this. 
And just a general comment.  The USD wallets have FDIC insurance.  
They do state that the 2% that they hold online (likely to facilitate buy/sell transactions) is insured, but they don't state who insures it.  It certainly isn't the SPIC or FDIC.

I could easily be wrong as I haven’t done it. Just something to consider as foreign transaction fees can be high at US banks. 
I don’t believe exchanges allow you to send money to another exchange.

Check the receiving banks wire department. Go into a branch in person.
