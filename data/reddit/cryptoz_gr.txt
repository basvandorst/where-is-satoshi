Black market (owner dread cat vicius)  &gt; hot wallet &gt; cold wallet 
                                                          ^Traceable    ^Traceable
Exchange :Dread cat vicius is creating an account 0x12j799.... and moves some coins there  
                                                                        ^ Traceable
Change with monero traceable move monero outside of exchange untraceable(i suppose).
Now all these are done using internet and you need an untraceable ip(chinese goverment sponsored hacker).
Also keep in mind that once a wallet is blacklisted the process of freezing accounts will be instant i don't know if there is time to change to monero.
A more dystopian world would correlate your fingerprints to a hash LOL.I hate to admit it but internet is the biggest human archive ever existed.In physical world memories cannot be archived by a third party organisation that everyone's trust thats why there is judges and courts.In virtual world everything is recorded by a common trusted application which can recall every action of the past.Public ledgers are not good if you need privacy.Just wait  when authoritarians unleash their weapons and public ledgers become THE enemy of people.I bet google already identified 90% of bitcoin  wallets(active) and owners.Why someone has to use a public ledger when privacy is the main objective?

Sorry if i am being uneducated about cryptos but if i send btc to an exchange did't i just tied up my name to the btc wallet where the coins came?Assuming i did KYC stuff there.If not its only 2 btc in average so not very good for large amounts . All this reminds of early internet days that everyone assumed there gonna be anonymous through a pc connected to internet which obviously lead the other way and everyone's life  is now being archived into the system way more efficiently  than before.
Edit:Ah you said wash btc before importing to exchange.That makes sense but how someone can do this?
