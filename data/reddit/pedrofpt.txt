From what I know, in rare cases it can take almost an hour (for the first confirmation).

Hi, we are based in Portugal (Europe). I have been running a web-store selling Bitcoin in Portugal for a few months ( lojabitcoin.pt ) and so I decided to open for the rest of the world. One of the main goals is to make this accessible for people without bank accounts, so they can just send cash in the mail. (I have clarified that in my text above). Bitcoinzap is not (yet) automatic like Bitinstant, however, we are planning a more automated system with more payments methods, but that is not yet ready.

I had the same problem, it said "Waiting to be processed" for several hours and now just says "Failed".

Also not working for me after the upgrade to Firefox 22.

Yes, while the system was "clogged" I maged to withdraw several transfers under 1 BTC.
All withdrawals seem to now be working 100%.

Maybe something like a Linux LoCo (Local Community)? Where people gather to discuss, trade CDs/DVDs, teach others, help install distros, etc.
A "Bitcoin LoCo" could offer advice, help set-up wallets and install programs, facilitate face-to-face trade, teach how to create paper wallets, sell small items like keyrings, CDs, shirts, etc...
