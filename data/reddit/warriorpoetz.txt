Fortunately those guys have pretty much spent their remaining goodwill with the Bitcoin community. Its mostly confused newcomers who dont know who to believe. I dont think Roger Ver and co. are spooking too many hodlers at this point.

People dont like market tampering, price manipulation, and insider trading. Especially people coming from the regulated stocks and bonds finance world. A lot of the meteoric rise the last few months was not bitcoin technology junkies. It was investors.

4 different cryptocurrencies cant be called diversifying.

Is that Roger Ver? Riding Bcash into the ground?

Does anyone know how long it is taking Gemini to verify new accounts? Had to bounce from Coinbase after today.

Its the motto, philosophy, strategy of holding onto bitcoin through the volatile ups and downs. The meme started from an old bitcointalk.org post where some guy misspelled hold. Also people say it stands for hold on for dear life. Here is a little post that describes it.

Same here. That was some shady stuff. This industry has enough issues with credibility, if Coinbase wanted to be a serious, trusted, brand in crypto they should have considered the ramifications here. As far as Im concerned they were either used or complicit in a big time scam by questionable people in the crypto world. Seems like they got greedy. Luckily there are alternatives for us.
