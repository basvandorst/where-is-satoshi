That's so exciting.  I actually spoke to my cab driver yesterday; he sends money to Eritrea every month and loved the idea of Bitcoin.  
So many business cards passed out.

Hello Mokahless.
Nobody at VoS is downvoting you.  
There was an error in the press release. We're sorry for the confusion... it's actually more like 9 months.

The feedback is also appreciated.  :) keep posting so we can answer any more questions or concerns you may have.  I'm currently working on a Q&amp;A/FAQ sheet for Divcoin to clear up any misunderstandings/miscommunications.

Hey everyone! Victoria here, helping out VOS. While I understand your frustration, keep in mind that VoS does focus entirely on the best user experiences for their clients. Sometimes dealing with bank requests and regulations can be frustrating. Vault works always with the client in mind. 
That being said, your feedback and opinions are in invaluable. So do keep them coming, and we are here To listen and improve it for everyone. 
It's supposed to be bitcoiners with bitcoiners, not bitcoiners vs. bitcoiners here... In any case, we hear your frustrations and encourage you to submit any more questions or concerns you have so we can communicate openly about them. 
Hope this helps....

Thanks for asking, Chefboyohboy -- Orders can be placed now and will be filled on Tuesday. Does this help?
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:41:26
Seriously? This is incredible if true -- any proof?

As mentioned before, despite what some may think sometimes, Vault is totally client-centred.  It's the core focus of the activities in the exchange.  When clients speak, the management team listens and works to ensure that clients are happy and feel listened to.
Your feedback is important, whether positive or constructive. So please, do keep it coming :)

So, it's essentially a mining contract, without the contract.
You buy a coin - that you can sell to others - that represents your participation in bitcoin mining. 
Every day, you get a small pay out of bitcoin that is mined that day.  This is your 'dividend'.  This nice thing about representing this in a coin is that you are not tied into a contract for mining, since you can sell the coin - and the future revenues that come with it - to a buyer. 
What else can we help explain? Also check out  for more information.

Thank you for your feedback!
Mokahless, we work always with our clients in mind.  Always. We want to give our users the best possible rates, user experience, and options when it comes to bitcoin and altcoins, and now, with our mining contracts.
We have lowered the cost due to increased difficulty on our next round.  
Please feel free to keep emailing in feedback, questions and concerns.  If I am slow to answer here, feel free to reach out to Mike, or hello too!
Mike is the expert in this, and will be happy to answer your specific questions. 
Team VoS

The OP has little idea how we operate, as well as what we are required to do. As you can see we are registered as a money services business, and often send data to the government when required. I'll let the OP research this, and report back to everyone what he/she discovers.
Here is the official link:

That's such a cool idea!
