I'm surprised it didn't go in a loop before saying the price.
Currently bitcoin is at 17,50...6...3...9...16..13..

Sounds like another thing they'll blame on the millenials.

Is there an actual POS coin used that matches the security of POW? And I'm not talking whitepapers, but actual live code.
I know Dash is PoS, but you need 1000 coins, and one coin is 900$ right now, which is not very scalable.

The amount of people pretending to know what the fuck they are talking about is amazing. What sucks is that people believe them.

Nicehash unloading the "stolen" funds ? /s
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:55:03


That's probably one of the most common way people get BTC. It's not an echo chamber, it's a real issue, and you can't control the fees on exchanges.

After a while you learn to ignore shills and idiots just like you ignore ads. 
Still not sure if the people that buy into bullshit predictions are legit idiots, or themselves bullshit artists promoting their own attitude. 
Meh, such is reddit.

Moving funds between wallets implies a transaction fee paid to the miners running the network.

Weekly/daily trading? That's not diversifying, that's just taking risks.
Unless you buy TittieCoin, it can only go up. /s

I want a miner that can handle 100c and doesn't need cooling. Something like that burning house dog meme.

People are looking at it as a store of value because it is a store of value. 
And I'm not so sure why you say shitty altcoins, some of those shitty altcoins are trading millions and have really smart people behind them, with good intentions, and react much faster than BTC has lately.
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:32:19
I'm not on the boat that it's a store of value either, I don't hold BTC, but it is what it is and if I had to pick a cryptocurrency to use for day to day stuff, BTC would not be it. I'm just forced into it because it's the only one accepted.
Fees are not only hindering adoption, they're hindering usage, which is much worse.
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:54:25
You people? We're on the same boat buddy. I just don't think BTC will be usable for small payments anytime soon. And by the time it will, other coins may already be there.

I don't use my savings account to pay for coffee. Why would I use bitcoin? 
Why would I expose a large sum to the world when spending 1$?
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:48:18
I do actually want to use BTC to pay for stuff, but reality is that it's far from that. It's more like a "I hope my transaction gets confirmed on time before that vendor will no longer accept it because BTC goes down/up 500$ on a moments notice so his validation time is short"
Or "Did I pay my coffee with 7CY48Dnt9KNWyEJkP2LpaL8lA7QL3SDi9BUZZksmsrGhC3UNxIRyMiJ4fPAFklDCTwFvdd1IcBx5a9b3yjDmxeHGCgIh1cR5n which has 50$ in it
 or did I pay it with

I haven't found a way to easily handle multiple addresses and pay with BTC, transaction fees aside. If you have one I'd be glad to try it.

If living in a former soviet block country has taught me anything, is that shitbags always come back in another form.

You are exaggerating my words immensely and missing the point.

Is he jealous or something? 
If you've made it as far as knowing what an ICO is and how to buy into it, you're somewhat more familiar with the dangers than the people he's fucked.

How do they plan to actually detect a currency which can be transferred to anyone anonymously without even moving it between accounts?
"Here's this wallet seed, it has money in it, take it." - someone on the phone.
You can transfer btc with words. And I'm not talking about voice commands.

Sorry but I don't remember getting cold calls from salesmen trying to sell me crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:35:30
Oh noes, the industry that is most responsible for millions or billions in stolen funds in the last 30 years thinks secure by design currencies are junk.
oh look, it's retarded.
We all know how easy it was(is?) to get a list of credit card numbers and actually use them to buy stuff, with little to no consequence.
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:17:30
You're assuming the current landscape will remain the same. 
For all we know btc could just become digital gold and altcoins would replace fiat, based on specific needs. 
You can be filthy rich in crypto and not own a single btc right now.

Thanks, now everytime I hear a loud obnoxious bike i'm gonna think about bitcoin.
