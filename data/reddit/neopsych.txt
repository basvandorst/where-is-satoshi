People wont simply earn Bitcoin. 
You need to Buy bitcoin. 
All these peoples were  clever enough to buy bitcoin with there savings at very early stage. Nevertheless late you can start buying today  and hodl it for a brighter future.

Coinbase, it is time to add Shit as prefix.
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:39:01
Yes, indeed earn.  Even I do.
But earning some sats just aint gona make any impact to the Op. Also  giving away Bitcoins are a mere method to improve  adoption.  However OP should first buy some Bitcoin then can start thinking about boosting it via earnings and all.

Welcome on board,
The only input  is buy some bitcoin and hodl it.
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:53:33
The biggest possible enemies of bitcoin can only be Altcoins only.  But imo they won't exist after 5 years.
@_date: 2019-10-08 13:13:32
Oh, ok then what about altcoins?
aren't they interested at all?
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:24:56
Lumi, never heard of something like that.

Technically speaking there is nothing can be  done with email, imo it may be to collect user info.

Bitcoin only matters.
no bcash/btrash/bshit

imo its due to "Butterfly Effect" - a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.

Completely Agree.
You don't have to explicitly mention that.  Everyone knows you well ☺️��✌️
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:28:55
TBH Bitcoin financially helped me in a lot way. My current lifestyle is only because of Bitcoin.

Wasabi, Samurai, Blockstream Green wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-24 10:04:05
tbh this is indeed a good biz model.
@_date: 2019-12-16 11:30:03
Sorry to say that but if you lost your seeds &amp; 2fa, then there is no way you can recover those funds.
@_date: 2019-04-04 09:26:28
Then there is no use in keeping an account in coinbase, delete your account from coinbase. Did you tried cash.app(square) ? 
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:01:48
Yes. 
Think in terms of long-term investment.
We are still very early w. r. t adoption. 
Miles to go ahead.
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:44:57
Yeah, agree.
OP didnt mentioned about shitcoins &amp; trading. Neither im not interested in that part also. 
You may say 1000 reasons against Bitcoin, but it wont give a fuck. 
It is not just about the profit dude, it is about having control over your financial sovereignty. I don't see any Shitcoin doing so.
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:48:20
Congrats for your wise decision, you are never late. 
1) You need to buy Bitcoin. You can buy Bitcoin via Cash.app, coinbase, localbitcoins etc.
2) Forget about trading, make this a long term hodling.
3) Run your own full node, or buy Casa , nodl , raspiblitz , can also run lightning network.
4) Buy a Hardware wallet like ledger, opennode. 
5) Move your coins to node wallet, and store keys in your hardware wallet. 
6) You're done, you're now running your Bitcoin full node with Lightning network which can also run behind Tor. 
Don't trust, just verify

Simplest way to buy Bitcoin AFAIK. Don't whether it is available in your country, check give a try ios/android app available.
