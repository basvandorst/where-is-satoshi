i guess thats your theory 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:53:37
They’re so incompetent that btrash copy and pasted from them. Pretty sure that makes bcrash devs much more incompetent, copying from incompetent people.

Yes, I can not go to r/btc unless I am ready to be attacked by 12 year old bcash freaks just for saying bcash. I call Burger King the bk lounge and don’t get attacked, why can’t I call bitcoin cash bcash? I call the supermarket “the mArket”, again, I don’t get attacked. It’s just shorter and easier to say. Bcash folk hate the word bcash because without bitcoin in their name, they have nothing. And they know that.

Bitblender works fine if you use the real link and not a phishing version of it like the links you have in your post 
@_date: 2018-05-05 03:14:13
Yeah, he was a millionaire before btc!!!! That means everything 
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:31:13
No. "bitcoin core" isnt a coin. Bitcoin cash is. Go to coinmarketcap and you will see the number one spot is BITCOIN, not followed by core. You bcashers call it bcore to try to make it equal with bcash. bunch of sad sad people you are. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:04:39
exactly. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:05:43
no. I am just saying, bitblender works fine if you use the real link. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:54:14
cool thanks for the input. Im no expert either, clearly :) 
@_date: 2018-06-11 04:30:46
b cash bcash bcash bcash bcash. thats what it is. loser
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:42:51
you are such a loser. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:46:21
maybe you didnt say it but thats the general theme of bcash. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:33:44
if youre just retarded then I feel sorry for you and all retarded people. if you are just trolling me then fuck off 
@_date: 2019-08-26 15:46:54
quant, its an operating system connecting blockchains. and i think its cool
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:40:06
right but I said the number 1 spot is bitcoin, i am aware that someone recently made a bitcoin core coin. just supports my argument even more that there is only 1 real bitcoin, and its not bcash. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:32:32
are you trying to say that bcashers dont think bcash is the real bitcoin?? you can just say that, you dont need to try to sound more sophisticated than you are or ever will be. you also dont need to respond. You are clearly either a moron or just trolling me. everyone knows that is bcash's position, being the real bitcoin. if it wasnt then they wouldnt claim that, and they also wouldnt insist on having bitcoin in their name. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:05:06
no, i just dont check reddit every day because im not a loser. so i just saw your stupid comment yesterday. sorry bud. youre likely not on anyones mind. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:02:04
I use Segwit, works great 
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:16:57
its not gambling. BTC is going up massively in value and that's really not debatable anymore, IMO. It is already the 8th most valuable currency in the world. Strictly a matter of time until it is the MOST valuable, even more than USD.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:05:46
The scammers started a vote on btcmarkets to have bcash changed to Bitcoin Cash. Here is a vote to keep it bcash. Vote away. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:38:49
BCashers started a vote to get btcmarkets to changes the name from bcash to Bitcoin Cash, so I started one to keep it bcash. Vote away ...
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:04:03
Not really

Lol, the artificially inflated out of Korea bch is going to shutdown btc in within weeks ...�� Thanks for the laugh. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:04:51
My confusion is, if bitcoin is so bad and terrible, why would they want the name of something that sucks so much!? It literally makes no sense. They obviously know bitcoin is superior to their bcash. They should just admit and coexist peacefully like other btc forks (litecoin for example)
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:24:51
you can vote here to have btcmarket keep the name bcash. (bcashers started a vote trying to get them to call it bitcoin cash) 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:00:55
So why risk Bitcoin Cash? The credit cards work fine 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:01:11
My comment was deleted too. All I said was “why the divide? Why can’t bitcoin be digital gold and Bitcoin Cash be digital cash? All the fighting does is scare newcomers away”.....
They removed that!!! I didn’t even take sides!!!!!!’ 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:30:01
Also be warned, this is just some guys opinion on Reddit!!!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:22:31
Yeah but who wants to use a bank and have all their shit tracked and recorded when you can use a P2P network for a couple bucks.....

Owning btc is not a crime. But if it was it wouldn’t matter. I lost my private keys and have zero access to mine. So even though I have all the purchases on coinbase, all my coin I sent to a wallet that I no longer have the key for. So, I can’t hand it over. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:16:06
but according to them this brand sucks ass
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:21:18
sucks :( 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:21:53
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:56:04
Litecoin is a fork and they don’t piggy back on the bitcoin brand name
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:43:06
Haha. Same plan that middle level marketers use. Harass people into buying it so the price can go up and they can at least get their initial back
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:56:50
I’m not your buddy, pal. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:49:21
I did. You must be a bcash shill. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:18:05
annoying people who take everything on the internet serious ^^^^^
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:18:07
Awe so cute ! He thinks bcash is real bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:49:51
Not alone.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:20:29
try not to lose them! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:59:49
Or just keep increasing the block size, that will work out great in the long run (banks)

Arizona is aiming to let citizens pay taxes in btc 
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:17:44
This. Any coin is better than bcash.

Regrating sucks dick! 
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:05:48
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:01:43
i dont think anything. Im just saying what arizona is aiming to do. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:13:24

but, but, but, Roger Ver was a millionaire before he got involved with bitcoin....
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:57:29
They credited me by accident then they debuted back more, so they owe me the difference. Seems likes it’s going to be a pain to get it back if I ever do. Been waiting a few weeks now 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:42:30
because its a knock off that makes false claims and is a toxicity to the whole cryptosphere. If they didnt claim to be the real bitcoin no one would care, but its trying to steal a decade of hard work that was simply copy/pasted/tweaked by a bcash dev that in the short term enables faster and lower fee transactions, but dont be fooled, it has much less use than the real BTC, should it ever catch up in volume, the fees and transactions times will rise. BTC is working on a long term scaling solution, not a quick easy band aid. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:49:35
I want one too, and I am at the point where I could have one, but then I wouldn’t have anything left to gains with :/ , so I hodl on. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:04:07
all i know is arizona is trying to establish themselves as a blockchain hub, and they are working on building a smart city 
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:40:38
i dont think many will find it funny, myself included. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:48:56
whos done the ledger update? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:39:02
I spend a few months each year in china and you can not get by without wechat. It is used for everything. Literally. It’s their internet basically, like the dude below me said. You even use it to unlock and pay for  the bikeshare bikes via QR scan.

bcash is a legit centralized crypto with an asshole leader

Roger and his goons and puppets are pumping bcash hard 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:10:17
the one near me is 8% fee
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:14:45
my coinbase ach is instantly available but the money doesnt leave my bank for up to 3 days 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:09:26
