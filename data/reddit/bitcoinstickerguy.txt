Thanks, but you did something wrong with the logo. Its background is shaded grey, not white :(
Watch this one before you do more work: 
Its almost perfect, except for the cutoff n which he might fix.
Yours has the addition of the sharpened QR part though :)

Also, yours doesn't scan for me with ZXing's barcode scanner, while the one of btcRaleigh does :(
This happens when displaying it at 9.8cm x 9.8cm size, which is the print size I'm going to use.
Maybe it would be wise to do the sharpening of the QR-part which tzimisce suggested?

Thanks! Best one so far!

I've literally spent half a day looking for a high-res version, trying all free QR code generators I could find, and couldn't come up with an exact reproduction of this one. The highest available resolution of 396x396 I could find is insufficient for printing :(
All modified designs suck IMHO, so please don't waste your time posting them. I want this exact design :)
One modification would be OK though: If someone could re-create it pointing to httpS://bitcoin.org instead of  - It would be nice to point newbies to the SSL version for security!
Thank you! :)

UPDATE: I managed to vectorize the thing with Inkscape. Will post a full vectorized version soon.
@_date: 2014-10-15 20:55:53
Don't waste your time, I've vectorized the thing already and will post the vectorized version once I'm done.

Hmm. Thanks. While I can understand that the color might change things, I think its quite ugly and unacceptable to change the Bitcoin logo :| Bitcoin marketing should have the same goal as regular marketing: To get people to memorize the brand name and logo. And that implies using the same logo and colors everywhere.
The original 10x10cm sticker which this image was from *does* scan, I have one right on my desk. And it *has* regular orange. So I think it should be possible to get this to scan just by fixing the QR code itself to be sharp enough...  Anyone wanna give it another try? :|
Sorry for being very precise with this, but I want to do major marketing, so everything has to be perfect ...
Also,  I was fair enough to state at the beginning that I don't want a modified design :)

Thanks very much.
Unfortunately, the same applies as with the one from Smashtray2 ( The ZXing barcode scanner won't scan it :(  You also cut off a bit of the N in Bitcoin
Maybe we do need to find a way to sharpen the QR code? :|
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:24:28
... just tried scanning the one of Smashtray2, it won't scan. So it would still be nice to have your sharpened one with the fixed logo (see my other post) to see whether that will scan.

You cut off some of the "n" in Bitcoin. It doesn't matter much, but if you still have the source file, you might want to fix it please.
But thank you already :)
One of the main features of Bitcoin is being able to send small payments for stuff like this, so it would suck if I didn't do it - beer sent! :)

Same offer applies to you:
(Cannot offer more, I want to spend as much as possible on printing many of the flyers and spreading them. But by that, you'll get the benefit of having free advertisement for Bitcoin, which in turn will increase the value of your investments :)
@_date: 2014-10-16 03:19:54
PS: I've sent you a sixpack of beer in Bitcoin nevertheless, for your inconvenience :)
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:11:39
Thanks. I'm not good with graphics software, so I need someone else to do this :(
btcRaleigh posted a 1096 pixel one, but it seems like he didn't do the trick of replacing the logo, and it does look kind of washed out because of that.
So I'll wait until tomorrow with ordering the stickers to see whether you deliver a better one than btcRaleigh, and use his if you don't.
Provide a Bitcoin address for a symbolic donation of lets say a sixpack of beer.
Thank you!
