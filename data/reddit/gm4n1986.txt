@_date: 2018-01-10 17:18:35
I do agree for the most part.. But people my age, friends and colleagues actually stay away from bitcoin. Not because of the high price, because of high fees and 'slow' tech 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:26:37
Ow shit.. I just read about the Crypto kittens. Never knew. That's just insane: 15% of all ethereum transactions
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:41:31
Bitstamp is your best bet for now.
Kraken has a good track record when it comes to security, but their platform is pretty much unusable because of the traffic increase they're experiencing 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:50:38
Ok thanks for the long response. it's nice to have some real discussion and get info instead of people yelling over each other.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:39:08
My transaction is stuck for 6 days now. To be fair I underpayed the fee(75 sat/byte), but still not very positive. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:26:59
Ah totally missed that thread, tnx
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:50:09
As it does look interesting, I just hope we can get it in time. 
Although I realize it takes time for good software to be released.

Yes true! The more info and opinions the more we can learn.

So I've have the eclair test wallet and some tbtc. I also have a channel open. How do I receive a payment? I've seen people posting their lightning address, but i only have an address strarting with a 2. Their addresses seem like a different format.
Appreciate the help

@_date: 2014-05-30 19:30:58
Some person/group is imo causing the move. Been the same pattern since $420, pump it, let the others buy, reach higher price and gently sell @ higher price,  repeat. 
I'm no pro in any way, just my thoughts 
@_date: 2014-09-20 17:13:39
While this is true.. Bitcoin has the market share already and if this works flawless, there is no need for coins like drk or monero

Except this subreddit doesn't allow begging. U won't have much luck here. 
U can sell stuff for coins or work for it. 
Both have dedicated websites, which I can't remember atm. Somebody else will know for sure.. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:14:29
Well it is for 99.9%.. I have a dedicated usb for electrum transactions. Before doing a transaction, I do a format of the usb stick. 
The only way (if it exists), is that malware gets in your usb, then automatically can find your wallet.dat file on your offline system, copy that file back onto the usb and send it back to the hacker on your online pc. 
Edit: I think the 'weak' point is the seed u have to recover your wallet. If somebody finds it, you're screwed 
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:09:41
Was thinking the same.. It's over 9000!! 
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:18:09
It was not Btc-e.. It was mintpal 
@_date: 2014-09-20 10:09:31
Nope. no password, no bitcoins! 
Only option is trying to brute force the password, which is only possible if it's a short password or you know parts of it. If you have no clue what us is and it's longer than 7-8 characters, it becomes very difficult and will take a long time. 
More info here:

So basically medici on top of counterparty on top of Bitcoin? 
If so, that would be very nice.

Indeed, actually surprised me it took so long! 
@_date: 2014-08-12 07:55:41
In theory, by that time, the network will depends on transaction fees.

@_date: 2014-05-29 15:39:44
^ this.. Just looking from a consumer grocery shopping the current system is 'fine', but bitcoin offers many other aspects that some people are attracted to. 
If u dig a little deeper, maybe u will find the things that attract many others among us. If u don't, maybe bitcoin isn't for u. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:47:29
It's not a story at all.. I can write similar articles:
Bitcoin used by pedophiles / terrorists / drugdealers / extortion
I mean, everything that involves money u can apply to bitcoin. Good and bad. 
It's getting very 'American' (no offence) like style. 
Just look at American news, it's full of horror stories and then take a look at our European news. Same crimes, different take on bringing it on the news

I'm very sorry for u, but they were online! Use cold storage (paperwallet or electrum/armory). Even storing them on your hard drive with a gooooood password (20+) is way better than at some cheesy exchange.
I mean I'm very cautious when it comes to my coins, never lost a satoshi (except when I thought I was a master daytrader)

Not high volume, but yes I do it whenever it's profitable to do

You are right, I judged to quickly. It is just a warning. I'm gonna try it next time I'm @ Starbucks. I'll keep u updated.

No address reuse.. What about when you get funds out of cold storage, but not all of it? Does it still resend the change back? 
Great work btw

@_date: 2014-02-21 02:42:09
I feel bad for the people who have btc/fiat over there, I really do!  .. But I still don't understand, after months of warning people to not use gox and especially don't leave btc there (or at any exchange for that matter), people just kept on using gox. 
I really just blows my mind! 
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:44:05
This has been discussed so many times and everytime answered in the same way. It's an inconvenience, not a problem. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:24:08
" One of Bitcoin’s initial advantages, and how it attracted early adopters, is the ability to do financial transactions completely anonymously. No government, corporation, or prying eyes, would be able to track your spending habits. This sounds great, and definitely has it’s perks, but it doesn’t yet work in today’s world.
Why not? Well, I will explain.
In order to make large purchases, sellers are usually going to need to know that you are a real person, and that your money is “clean”. You can’t sell a house, car, or plane ticket, without knowing the identity of the buyer. This is just a fact. "
Well, that's not really true. The whole concept of bitcoin is that it's trustless, so it's not necessary to know/trust the other party. 
Bitcoin is and should remain fungible. A bitcoin is a bitcoin, regardless where it comes from.
In theory u could sell property without the need of knowing the seller. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 13:59:23
1 important thing.. Spend all your funds when withdrawing a paper wallet.. Lots of mistakes happened in the past. 
For example: paper wallet with 5 btc.. Owner wants to spend 1 btc and does something wrong and 4 btc go to the miners as a fee. 
Correct me if I'm wrong! 
@_date: 2014-12-05 08:42:44
There is/was a nepalese Bitcoin exchange: bitxnepal.com, but website seems to be down. Facebook page is still active. But always be careful with unknown exchanges ;) 
Anyway, keep up the good work! 
@_date: 2014-09-15 17:01:20
Depends, do you have btc already? If so, it would be 0.05 usd 
If you have to buy send and sell: between 0.5-2% depending on which exchange you use
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:38:32

@_date: 2014-05-23 18:04:45

@_date: 2014-08-08 12:51:00

Also try kraken.com.. Here you get Bitcoin cheaper. 
But with anycoin.eu you can buy instantly. With kraken, you have to wait until your SEPA transfer has arrived. 1-3 days

How long is it?

Verification at kraken +/- 10min :) if u don't trade/deposit/withdraw over a €1500 a day, u don't even have to give your personal info! 
I just sent an email to bitstamp asking why these ridiculous KYC question. Wondering if I will get an answer 
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:36:28
I think it gone.. They send a message here to empty your account before some date. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:57:31
Exactly! And he/she/them are doing a great job.. Dump very gently so people stay bullish. I'm no expert, but looking at the charts, u can almost see where the small dumps take place. Not to hard not to soft. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:57:35
True, but it could also have gone up. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 22:21:01
U will like it more when u see the features they have over other exchanges! 
@_date: 2014-10-03 12:55:09
I thought it was know tor is not 100% reliable.. Or is that not what u mean?
@_date: 2014-04-15 07:53:55
Wake me up when it hits 1k again.. Then I will start to get exited. (price wise) 
Bitcoin in general always gets me exited!

@_date: 2014-03-17 18:42:19
Cryptsy .. A lot of altcoin trading. Doesn't have the best reputation, but i never had a problem with them
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:14:45
But these are not normal KYC requirements! 
If u don't know them, here u go:
1. How did you learn about Bitcoin? 
2. The purpose of trading on Bitstamp? Please describe in as much detail as possible how you intend to use your trading account. 
3. What is the origin of the deposited Bitcoins? If mining, please specify your hardware specifications and submit a receipt or an invoice for your mining equipment. 
4. What are your future plans and activities planned on our exchange? 
5. Do you plan more withdrawals in the future? 
6. Which bank do you intend to use? Please provide the complete address and SWIFT code. 
7. Estimated amount that you would be depositing/withdrawing to/from your Bitstamp account per month (in USD and BTC)?
Anyway, u do what u want, it's just an option. Large amounts need further verification. 
Btw kraken owners are known and they have proven there solvency not that long ago.

No name discussion. just a 1 time change, never worry about it again
@_date: 2014-04-14 07:07:33
The fact it's decentralized.. Well, that's my reason. Maybe the average Joe rather has centralized money/crypto. 
I think as long as a random person hasn't had a problem with banks (not able to get their funds out/money gone) they will prefer centralized systems. 
Edit: where I live, the government has all citizens money covered up to €100000.. I like to see them cover that when something major is going on! Spoiler: they simply can't! 
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:52:03
You're right.. But it got fixed right? Nobody who is invested in btc wants to compromise the network unless they have 1 brain cell! 
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:22:04
So u want to do the same as bitreserve? Using the bitcoin network but people see only fiat displayed in their account. So $100 stays a $100, no matter what the price of bitcoin is, right? 
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:21:37
If u backed up the wallet, u still have your coins. The same like with a mp3 song
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:10:33
Read the FAQ on the right. It will answer a lot of your questions. 
There are many different wallets. U can use an online 3rd party wallet who will store your bitcoins for u, like blockchain.info or wallets where u control your bitcoin, like: bitcoin core (original), electrum, armory. 
Paperwallet is a good option to store bitcoins safe for long term storage. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 09:43:36
Well, I guess most people know this and can decide for themselves if they want to participate
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:47:22

Here's a start
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:22:46
So many things.. I suggest u take a few hours and discover it for yourself and u would be amazed with the pros of bitcoin. 
And when u are reading, read the cons also (yes there are cons ;) ) 
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:03:44
U can have that opinion sir ;) 
BUT I dare u to name all the pros/cons in a single answer. 
It's always better to educate yourself instead of getting (maybe) a half ass answer. Anyway I gave u an upvote ;) 
@_date: 2014-10-03 15:46:38
Sell 70-80% of exchange, keep 20-30%. 
Although I bullish longterm, I think almost anybody would sell of a large chunk.
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:08:05
Because it should even out over a few transactions. 
Things like this should disappear when/if btc goes mainstream 
@_date: 2014-08-16 14:17:40
Soon it will be Russia, Cuba, Iran and New York 
@_date: 2014-01-28 12:27:45
It works.. I mined ppc in the past 
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:36:58
I've sent them an email with that exact same question.. No response :/
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:58:39
Take a look at: bitreserve
Not up and running, but they aim for what u mean 
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:33:03
U know that, I know that. 
But once u start talking about: boot a Linux OS from cd or usb and.. No contact with the Internet.. BIP38..  Few more steps.. Aaaaand done! 
Vs hey store your bitcoins here fairly secure 
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:45:26
Imho it says: we don't have enough coins, so we will release them slowly, so we can continue our little 'scam'
Luckily I've never used gox.. If people will still use it when withdraws are enable, I can' t feel sorry anymore for those ppl
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:28:56
Some people where able to buy with Mastercard/visa outside the US although they say it's not possible
@_date: 2014-03-09 08:32:16

@_date: 2014-05-07 20:05:20
If u are from Europe, I would advise u to use kraken.com.. I also use to trade on bitstamp until last month because of the silly KYC rules
At kraken no verification if u stay under €1000 a day

@_date: 2014-06-04 13:15:07
So again: uBTC aka microbitcoin aka unofficial 'bits' 
The 0.00xxx is confusing for some people. It's easier to see 5000 uBTC or 5 mBTC instead of 0.005 btc 
Btw it's you're, not your 
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:46:11
Location / country? 
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:02:18
I would suggest bitstamp for that. If in EU, u can also use kraken, but volume is pretty low

True, it is just a drop in the ocean. But I do understand the waiting from traders. A lot will depend on the btc being sold over or under market price. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:20:37
Why not both.. Just exchange bitcoin for zerocoin when needed
@_date: 2014-01-21 13:22:59
E-gold, digicash = napster 
Bitcoin = p2p filesharing (kazaa, torrent, etc) 
Anyway, I'm not here to start a whole discussion ;) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:17:26
I agree, but what with coins u recieved from somebody in exchange for good services who have been stolen before? U didn't do anything wrong, still u have tainted coins. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:59:40
Was thinking the same.. Probably used gox price @ $135
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:57:11
Nobody with a little sense will say that it's guaranteed to go up. 
In fact, the most repeated comment is: don't invest more than u can afford to lose, because it can always fail/price crash. 
Just think about how people must have felt after the 2011 bubble (30-&gt;2) or April 2013 (2601-&gt;80).
People who have bought in 2011 above $10 had to wait until 2013 to be in the green. 
Maybe you are right and by all means, sell, get out and don't look back 
Or join Edit: 2601 should be 260 (or 250 like commented below)

Electrum.org 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:03:01
If u are from Europe, switch to kraken.com! I use to trade on bitstamp (and I think it's good) but I switched to kraken since the ridiculous KYC requirements 
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:08:17
Ok fair enough, didn't think about those 2 (and I actually use both of them) ;) 
But pizza.be and similar are accepted in almost all of Europe. 
Look at the Netherlands for examples, they have 2 whole Bitcoin boulevards. 
I would love that Belgium would become a leader in Bitcoin adoption, don't see it happening
Edit: without noticing, I see I almost repeated everything Tuur said. 
you are Tuur demeester, correct?
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:19:08
Depends on when the picture is taken ;) 
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:01:50
Ah, no. it's all yours, Enjoy! 
@_date: 2014-08-30 10:03:29
Ok, that seems to be a valid answer. Had not thought this far about is. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 14:10:03
Euhm.. Lol! 
@_date: 2014-07-26 10:00:23
Haha really!? I was wondering what the Asterix was for 
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:00:25
True, but the same goes for bitstamp. 
I just buy/sell and instantly remove fiat/btc from the exchange
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:10:39
PM me 
@_date: 2014-05-26 00:37:21
Ok I hear you.. But it's not gonna work here to raise 200 btc, I see people going nuts when they finally own 1 bitcoin, therefore I don't think u will find the same generosity here as in the doge sub. 
Although I don't own dogecoin, it would say the dogecar is a pretty sweet accomplishment
@_date: 2014-12-12 05:45:57
I understand Bitcoin well, but could never simplify it like this to newbies. 
Excellent! I'm gonna copy past it! 
1000 bits
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:36:08
Paying taxes on bitcoin haha.. How cute! 
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:41:35
U like fish sticks!? I love em!! 
@_date: 2014-08-06 01:07:57
U should watch out with these companies delivery dates. I don't this one, but rarely miners get shipped on the promised date. 
So if u ask me, no don't buy this. Buy coins directly instead. 
It's just my opinion, for more information u should visit @_date: 2014-06-30 15:50:06
Haha I know the poker feeling.. Even though I was in profit, I stopped exactly for the same reason! Btc on the other hand is way less stressful for me! 
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:16:08
U should watch the videos from the YouTube channel: world bitcoin network 
@_date: 2014-06-24 22:45:56
It's a bit of a gamble.. If u think the price @ the auction will be higher than market value, buy now and visa versa
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:10:27
U will loose money doing this! 
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:45:42
Watch out, we got a bad ass over here!

No, not for now!

@_date: 2014-02-20 17:38:17
ELI5 why u can't use the search ;) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:54:28
Yes probably, so that's why we need an decentralized exchange like coinffeine. 
If it will ever work properly! 
@_date: 2014-05-28 01:30:27
No, it was doing good business until the government came along 
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:39:13
Lol, they are not! 
Source? Don't give me the blockchain.info charts! It's just not accurate 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:49:34
Ofcourse make multiple copies and store them in different places! And yes electrum is also good. I have both 
@_date: 2014-08-28 08:35:04
In a ponzi scheme you need new people all the time to keep it going and profits are 'guaranteed' 
With bitcoin this is not the case. No guaranteed profits and new blood isn't necessary to keep it going 
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:38:09
Yes bitcoin is, companies not 
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:28:33
They have a way to also include usd in a decentralized way. More info in the video on their website. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 11:47:36
So u want to get your Bitcoin from armory to an other wallet, correct?
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:29:37
How is it different with buying gold? U bought gold @ ~ $1900/ounce 2 years ago and now it's around $1300. Same loss no? So is gold a pyramid scheme? 
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:34:02
U mean getting payed in bitcoin and instantly transfer to cash or keep it in bitcoin? 
If it's the first check out: coinbase, bitpay or bips. (usually a fee or some cost) 
Otherwise u can open an account with blockchain.info and accept bitcoin (free) 
@_date: 2014-09-11 11:09:52
Ok fair enough, I wish u the best!
 
You have bigger cojones then me ;)
@_date: 2014-08-23 10:05:39
Good morning all! 
I was taking a better look at services that are going into beta soon. 
What are the projects you guys are really excited about. 
For me it's: 
* bithalo 
* openbazaar 
* Bitreserve 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:47:30
If u have 40min, this will give u a lot of important info.. One of the best explanations about everything bitcoin has to offer! 
Edit: the video is: stefan molyneux - the true value of bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:36:54
Probably yes.. Still, doesn't mean bitcoin itself is a pyramid scheme. 
Edit: not saying you are implying it's a scheme, was more of an answer towards OP
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:25:01
Imo, It's more a person/group who is pumping to price and gently selling to make profit. It are all 'big'  price jumps in 10 min, then 24-48 stability and a decent sell wall. Has been repeated since $420
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:20:55
Use an Ubuntu live cd as a clean OS and generate your paper wallet there 
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:27:38
The good reason is the fact miners get rewarded.. No intensive for the miners to mine, no secure network. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:57:19
It's a good provider, but it's located in the USA. Big no no for me when it comes to a privacy service 
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:11:00
Mine is already divided between gold, bitcoin and real estate 
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:15:15
U look at it wrong.. The price was around $100, 'bubbled' to $1200 and now it's looking to settle at a 'fair' price. 
Also the events/news lately aren't that good
Edit: look at bitcoinity.org/markets over 2 years (log scale) and u will see this happened a few times. Also yes, use the search 
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:38:41
Still, don't put them online.. No matter what OS u are running. 
Just use cold storage for most of your bitcoin. Leave a little in a hot wallet 
@_date: 2014-09-29 12:34:36
What kind of credit card? 
Is het gwn u bankkaart van u bankrekening/zichtrekening? Of toch visa/Mastercard-achtig

Yeah, i know what u mean. But I'm sure that my daily spending address would be pretty easy to identify. 
Cold storage on the other hand, not so much. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 11:29:32
Yes and no.. I pay a annual fee. ~ €20 
If u use sepa or not, the fee stays the same. So it doesn't cost extra 
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:13:23
Probably armory isn't synced with the network 
Amory downloads the entire blockchain.. You can use wallets like electrum that doesn't require the full download
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:22:47
K nice.. Thank you! 
Edit: So what u are saying is that I can have 2 watch only wallets created from the same private key? Sounds logical, just never thought about it. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:37:04
I agree, still that's a crazy profit in just 4-5 months. 
Well,  hindsight 20/20 I guess 
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:17:53
Millibits is better.. IF bitcoin succeeds, we will need it again at some time. 
Just my opinion ofcourse 
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:35:42
Well it's a little volatile in terms of usd, but in terms of percentages, it almost never had been this 'stable' 
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:30:40
Inside buying on gox, selling on other exchanges maybe? 
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:45:22
If u know most of the password, it's possible to brute force, but it will go slow, since bip38 is designed to be hard to brute force. 
There is thus guy in the community name dave(?) .. He does it for 20% of the btc
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:30:19
Bull = optimistic 
Bear = pessimistic (right word? English not my first language) 
@_date: 2014-07-10 21:57:37
No, none of them :/ 
Anyway Tnx for the effort 500 bits 
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:15:34
Send me the double bitcoins first and I will send u half! 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:27:18
Ok 'fill in random nickname' 08. Which exchanges are u talking about? Price under $200 for longer than a day didn't happen on ANY other than gox.. True a 5-10min dip happened, so technically u are right. Still, let's be serious and say the real price always was at least 400.
Anyway we all know u hate bitcoin for some reason and u can, but don't go around and think u know it all. Nobody does. It's not because 1 thing u said happened that u know it all! U have said so many things, it had te happen that u are right sometimes. 
Anyways, no hate.. But I just read so many shit posts of yours, I had to say it once. 
Let's just agree the future will tell! 
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:59:15
'Address' with a 5 is always your private key, with a 6 is a private key with password (BIP38) 
3 for multisignature public address 
1 for normal public address
U can use services like coinjoin or dark wallet for more anonymity 
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:58:43
Actually it's not that complex, but yes do read up on it. It's pretty good! 
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:29:46
Oh boy! What was the suicide hotline number again!? 
Like said before, don't put in money u can't afford to loose! And this advice is exactly for people like u. 
Anyway, the most of luck to u! 
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:20:38
I do it sometimes, but it's a whole hassle. After all fees and wire costs and conversion fee, I have a profit of 5-6% 
What I do is buy and sell at the same time, so there is no volatility 
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:28:30
I don't know about the drivers for a 10 year old printer. When I did it (lubuntu) the printer got recognized and didn't need any drivers

I'm going to practice already, I'm taking a sabbatical year in a few months ;) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:59:19
You are right, but who are they to say it's fungible or not. No? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:30:26
While I agree with u, something like this needs to happen if u want world wide adoption. 90% wouldn't want to care how to make a proper cold storage. 
I think with multisignature and new innovations, one day it will be 99% safe to store with 3rd parties. 
But your statement is 100% true! 
@_date: 2014-08-12 11:47:27
While Richard is probably right about Kenia and surrounding countries. 
This is about 1 area in the world which is (sadly) one of the poorest regions in the world. 
Imo, for now, countries like the Philippines, India and others with better infrastructure (phones, Internet, etc) can benefit more from bitcoin than African countries. 
That being said, it's always good to get some local, real life feedback instead of 'Internet truths' 
@_date: 2014-04-17 22:31:30
It's very hard to Brute force. With a long enough password, it would take many years 
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:09:30
Congrats, but personally I wouldn't sell for that small (subjective) amount. 
I would do it the other way around, keep bitcoin and buy things for the house with every paycheck. But that's your decision of course 
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:30:18
Cmon, what was your bid?! 
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:42:43
True, but i followed the rally closely and it was the same pattern every 24-48 hrs: buy large amount, drive up price, people buy to not miss the boat. Person/group puts up sell wall.. Sell wall gets eaten (= profit for the guy/group) not much later: huge buy and repeat. Until 680, they dumped a lot! 
Ofcourse I'm not a pro, but these are my thoughts after closely viewing to charts. But I could be wrong! If so, no problem saying that
Edit: I just saw 's comment which describes the same.. So i' m definitely not alone with this assumption 
And if people don't like what I say, I don't mind a downvote or two. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 10:36:36
From what I heard, u don't have to pay taxes on bitcoin when u keep them for longer than a year. Germany was basically the first country were bitcoin use was legal. If I remember correctly, it's placed under 'private money' 
@_date: 2014-03-03 23:29:23
They probably have breakfast! 
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:38:20
Don't know then.. Somebody here will know I guess 
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:31:34
Don't use gox now or ever!! U can deposit, but can't get money or btc out! 
If u'r in the US, use coinbase. 
Europe bitstamp or kraken 
@_date: 2014-08-25 08:43:33
U can re-send the transaction 
Other than that, not much u can do 
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:54:20
Yes.. There is a development team. But in theory everybody can suggest changes. Needs to be approved by the majority 
@_date: 2014-09-08 10:35:53
People don't care about it!? 
Every year the adoption goes up and the price also. (we'll see for 2014)
Major retailer adoption in the last year.. Media coverage, etc. 
Now is the time people are starting to get comfortable with it. 
I agree people don't want to deal with the hassle of actually understanding Bitcoin and secure them themselves, but that's something that is being build right now. 
But in the end, it's your decision and hell, maybe you're right! We'll see
@_date: 2014-07-12 21:37:31
I'm not very up to date with the whole cloud mining. Did u do the math? Will Peta be profitable? 
If the answer is no, u are better off just being some coins

You are forgetting that the US isn't the only country in the world 
@_date: 2014-08-10 22:32:08
1. Around 2016 
2. Nobody knows
 
3. It's build into the protocol and because of   the hard limit cap of 21million 
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:34:10
Yes, for Europeans kraken and bitstamp.. Fast deposits and withdraws! 
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:13:58
Haha, I did the same thing, before I saw your comment :)
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:34:21
Yes it is, but it's pre configured for the people who can't pr don't want to make the tails usb. 
U don't really have to trust the third party as it shouldn't ever come online. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:33:06
That's not that long.. For me sepa on stamp is 2-3 days

Yes bitcoin (only) tipping on fb.. I'm trying to find it on Google, no luck so far 
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:56:37
Yes, very true.. It's going very fast. People tend to forget that. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:22:29
Yes, search for: secure paper wallet. It's explained very well
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:04:16
Haha, then this will make u jaw-drop! 
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:46:05
Electrum(.org) wallets 'share' a central server where the entire blockchain is downloaded. It connects within seconds and no need to have the entire blockchain. 
There is probably a better explanation for it, but that's basically how it works
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:00:39
Belgium here, very easy via kraken 
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:36:48
Should be valued in mBTC or uBTC aka bits 
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:37:22
I started downloading it and it got interrupted.. Is there a way to continue downloading?
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:05:01
500 bits 
@_date: 2014-07-07 23:42:07
It's kinda difficult to buy with a credit card. U will have more luck using a wire transfer to bitstamp.net / kraken.com / bitfinex.com / Btc-e.com 
Maybe search for an exchange in North Africa 
Edit: 
take a look at this:  Exchange for the middle east and North Africa. I've never used this site, so read up on it before using it. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 11:51:52
So basically the same as gold, stocks etc work!? 
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:20:08
Girls are gonna love this! 
@_date: 2014-06-12 11:22:11
So basically circle and/or bitreserve. Future will tell! 
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:06:14
They've raised 40 million in total, the 100 million is the value of the company I guess
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:05:36
I always use bitstamp.net with sepa.. Never had a problem. Never used kraken myself 
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:58:39
Not.. It was a site for (mostly) illegal goods. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:33:24
Maybe his face is white? 
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:47:33
What exactly do u want to know? There are so many aspects and you will get lost in all the information I guess
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:21:05
Or u can use one of these.. Offline ofcourse. 
It has electrum pre installed 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:40:34
Verify.. That's the only option I guess
@_date: 2014-09-03 03:48:06
Ok that's fair! Don't know what happened there   -_-
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:00:10
Yeah.. Member for a week and using gox charts. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:28:43
Tnx captain obvious! No way it's ever 10% for buying bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:56:41
Would u do it? 
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:32:15
No longer profitable will lead to less miners until it is back profitable.. Just my 2 cents 
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:51:45
Ok to name of few I find important :
* 'be your own bank' : u have (and only u) control over your money. U send any amount anywhere in the world without somebody questioning why. Or freezes your account. 
* I think it will be (in a few years) very helpful for remittances. Now these people are paying ridiculous fee's to send home internationally.
* more privacy in general. 
* low cost of transfer: around $0.06 for now
* bitcoin as a currency, is just one of the aspects it is capable of.
It can be used as a proof of ownership for cars,  houses, any kind of property. 
And many more. If u are interested I can give u some links with way better information. 
Btw nothing of this is really helpful to your grocery question, but that's why I said the current system is just fine for that. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:02:04
Nice, didn't know that. Have to read up on OT I guess. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 09:55:38
I agree that banking in europe is better/less worse than in the rest of the world. So for transfer within the EU it's as good as it will ever get. But.. U still don't control your own money. 
EU banks can still 'forbid' to make some transfers. When making international transfers, they still rob u with all kind of fees. 
And (for me) most important: EU banks can also fail.. Here in Belgium, the government guarantees to cover all losses under €100k.. A promise they can never keep, simply because they don't have enough money! 
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:20:47
The problem with PIA, is that they are located in the USA. It's a decent service, but i would never trust an American based Vpn provider. I'm using btguard for now. Hide.me also looks great!

No disrespect, but this has been discussed over and over. 
While I agree it's not perfect, for now it's as good as it gets. 
I saw tens maybe hundreds of suggestions, none of them was much better than we have now. 
I'm sure when somebody comes up with the perfect denomination, everybody will gladly agree, since few people think it's perfect now

That 600 dollars/coin is debatable. Part of the price is speculation about the future. Imo, no, 1 btc is not worth $600 atm. But  with the potential of bitcoin $600 could be very low. So, actual price + speculation seems the bring it to $585 for now.

In short: it's hard to do. Because of fees and getting fiat out quick.

It is indeed funny. 
But for bitcoin the technology, the price actually doesn't matter. 
But a higher price/rapid growth will help adoption, because people have this little thing called greed and people will come where the money is. 
For me the price doesn't matter that much (ofcourse higher is better), because I bought over a year ago. 
I can imagine people who bought all the way down and are in the red, it does matter.

It is possible, u just have to find an exchange will a good spread over kraken.

Only is u are willing to spend lots of money on hardware. For example: $6000 Knc miner running @ 3TH/s will generate u 7.4 bitcoin / month with the current difficulty. After only 2 weeks it would drop to 6.5 btc/month. 
This are estimated calculations. 
When u order now, u won't know when they will ship.. They say: shipment (third batch) will begin one month after batch 2 has been shipped. So u actually don't know when u will get them. 
Let's say u get it in 2 months, u would maybe generate 3-4 btc a month (not accurate) and u will probably don't see any profits due to the difficulty increase. 
If u would just buy $6k in bitcoins.. U are sure the have 12 btc right now. 
I can only say I mined once when the asic usb came out. (about a year ago) I barely profited and only selling the hardware, gave me a little profit. 
I would have made more profit just buying coins instead of the hardware! 
Many will say this is a much 'safer' bet.

Have u ever considered that this is 'normal' growth behavior.. Not even 6 months ago the price was around $100. 
Sure the recent news is not great for the price.. But it will go away and then (maybe) we can see an upwards trend. Although the past is not an indication for the future.. Bitcoin went true 3-4 'bubbles' and the price  always gets corrected, stays horizontal for a while until the (potentially) next uptrend

But what happens if your service goes away? Will I lose my coins?
GreenAddress.it signs each transaction with its own key in addition to client-side signing by user's keys, and funds are stored in 2-of-2 multisignature outputs requiring both signatures to spend. The drawback of it is that you cannot control your funds without GreenAddress.it's signature, so you are right to worry that you can lose your coins.
But! We have solved this issue by providing nLockTime transactions which essentially make deposits 'expire' after some time, which allows redeeming them without our intervention after this pre-set period of time. It is enabled by default when you have email notifications and two factor enabled.
This allows you to keep your ease of mind even in case GreenAddress.it disappears with its keys.
It also means that every time the funds expire the user has to re-transfer them. This can be automated on login and notified in advance via email or manually done.
For redeeming the funds after expiration, you can use a tool we've developed specifically for this purpose - see Gentle and its project on GitHub. It's open source!

At the intersection of technology and capital, entrepreneurs in the Middle East are hoping that Bitcoin will prove the next big thing.
David El Achkar, a former McKinsey employee who has started Yellow, a company that provides Bitcoin payment products to firms in the Middle East, has a number of bright ideas about how to turn Bitcoin into a fully-fledged currency regime.
He thinks Bitcoin’s potential to change how people interact is comparable to the invention of the internet.
“It’s like pre and post-internet times. Bitcoin as a technology … allows anyone to innovate … with value. We now have this platform that enables completely permissionless value transfer. Which is very exciting.”
Mr El Achkar sees Bitcoin disrupting existing industries in remittances, retail banking and the media.
“Right now, we’re paying hefty fees to send money … we’re paying for [banks’] infrastructure … which includes a lot of inefficiencies,” he said.
Tarik Kaddoumi, a co-founder of Umbrellab, which provides Bitcoin payment solutions to retailers, is similarly enthused. “As Bitcoins are free to transfer worldwide, there will no longer be a need for anyone to charge for remittances, and consequently anyone charging for it will go out of business,” he said.
Mr El Achkar explained: “To use Bitcoin you need a phone or an internet connection. But only 20 per cent of the adult population [has a bank account]. So as more Bitcoin services are developed for devices, anyone who has a phone can … have their own Bitcoin bank account on their phone and send and receive money internationally.”
Fees can vary between 0.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent to change national currencies to Bitcoins. But this is likely to fall in the long run, Mr El Ackhar said.
“[And] that’s still significantly [cheaper] than the online payment options you have in the Middle East.”
Bitcoin could also allow companies to make money from microtransactions – payments of less than $1, where volume is key. This could be a boon for the media industry, which has experimented – mostly unsuccessfully – with various ways to make newsgathering in the 21st century economically viable.
“Online content monetisation is [currently] provided by ads and online subscriptions that are expensive, inconvenient … and doomed.” But “micropayments -- [allow for] many ways of doing business we can’t even think about.”
But there are still significant hurdles to Bitcoin’s adoption globally – and especially in the Middle East.
“It’s a chicken and egg problem, as all marketplaces are,” said Mr El Achkar. “You need more users to incentivise businesses to use it, and more businesses to incentivise users to use it. ”
Bitcoin’s small number of users hasn’t helped.
Mr Kaddoumi also pointed to the lack of innovation as a challenge. “Ideally, we would have a lot more independent and innovative risk takers, with ideas and solutions that will be offered globally from the Middle East,” he said. “The environment is still more reactive than proactive.”
More recently, the bankruptcy of Mt Gox, an exchange on which the majority of Bitcoins were traded in early 2013, has damaged confidence in the currency. No clear explanation for the exchange’s collapse has yet emerged.
And some critics have pointed to the cryptocurrency’s use in illegal trades online, notoriously on the global bazaar and drug emporium Silk Road. Yet, as Mr Kaddoumi points out, “The world’s favourite medium of exchange for any criminal activity, drug trafficking, terrorism, corruption, money laundering and white-collar crime, is good old cash.”
Building confidence in the security and trustworthiness of the currency is vital. But the likelihood that new ideas will bring new ways to take advantage of the cryptocurrency provides some hope for Bitcoin entrepreneurs.
“It’s really up to people like us to develop solutions,” said Mr El Achkar. “Some will work out, some won’t, but that’s how we’ll reach the second stage – true innovation that’s going to change business and change the way we live the same way the internet did – in unpredictable ways.”

Basically an address is anonymous, but with some digging around in a blockchain Explorer, it's pretty easy to link an identity to an address.

U create a transaction on your online system, but because the online wallet doesn't have the private key to sign, u need to take that unsigned transaction to your offline wallet and sign the transaction. Your offline system has the private key to sign. 
With this method, your private key doesn't touch the Internet!

It's part 1 of 3 (total of 90min video) after this, u will beginning to understand bitcoin. All of his other video's are very good too. 
If u watch all of his video's, u will understand bitcoin pretty good! 
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:54:48
Use bitstamp.net .. U can send a sepa deposit for free and withdraw money for €0.9 fee! I use them all the time and never had a problem. Greets from a neighbor (belgium)

Take a look at vertcoin.. Afaik, it's cpu mining only (?) 
U can mine vertcoin and exchange it for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:33:51
Depends how u see it.. Yes bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency, but other centralized digital currencies (E-gold, hashcash etc) were first. 
Kinda like napster &lt;- &gt; bittorrents 
Something better can come along, but the thing is: bitcoin can adopt improvements from other crypto's. Future will tell.

Btw, something very important to know when dealing with paper wallets is how change works. Lots of people lost money with it. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 10:29:19
Use mycelium for Android and keep an amount of btc in it like u would carry cash. 
For larger amounts, use paperwallet. U can import a paper wallet in mycelium

Like intrepod said: learn about Bitcoin and decide for yourself. 
Imo if u are ok (potentially) loosing $300, go for it.
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:11:02
As it is for bitcoin, Litecoin, dogecoin and so on.. Nobody knows! 
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:59:20
Ok done. Tnx
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:32:40
Yes I can do basic math.. And your math is right. 
But, u can't calculate it that way. Transaction costs is not coins minted per day devided by daily transactions. 
It's hardware + electric cost - btc earnings. Let's say on average miners mines at a small loss. Let's say 10%. it's not that much imo. 
So 3600 new coins / day @ $600 = $2.160.000    
So that leaves u with an effective cost of around 216k / 60k transactions = 3.6 usd/transaction. 
If miners on average only lose 1%, the number would be 36 cents. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:20:33
I don't know which countries they serve. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 00:35:15
Still, it's pretty close this one 
@_date: 2014-07-11 00:45:39
Yes it's common to include a fee for the miners. As the block reward declines over time, fee should make up for it, so people keep an intensive to mine aka secure the network. 
You can send without a fee, but then the transaction could take hours/days. 
This is a good site about it:

Nice! Love the symbol and design.. But (like many others) I really don't like bit as the unit. Hopefully, someone will think of something which sounds good and has a meaning towards bitcoin. That would be awesome! 
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:02:21
Bitstamp and kraken are most of the time within a $10 range. So not much difference I guess. 
Would be crazy if they are really running a fractional reserve.. Didn't they just have an independent audit? 
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:37:56
Yes 
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:55:43
Best and cheapest would be having a European bank account, so u can call out free using a SEPA transfer. 
I don't know any other methods right now
Edit: opening a bank account is very easy as a foreigner. At least in Belgium it is
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:24:07
True.. But why not just say 'like torrents' instead of like napster, but not really etc. Anyways, good article! 
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:19:13
Don't buy this.. U will mine 0.01 btc monthly. 
U will not mine the cost of the miner + electricity! Just buy $75 of bitcoin

I don't know how people exactly do it.. But I have always thought that the interest in tax evasion true bitcoin will be huge once those people start using it. 
I know tax evasion is 'bad', but that's not the point here

I use to be the guy who wanted to explain it.. But it's pointless. I only talk about bitcoin when a person asks me. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:34:43

No, they won't give the price.. It was written on the site of the auction 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:05:07
Yes, but the good thing is (except for the volume) kraken is better than bitstamp in many ways! Super fast SEPA deposit and withdraws.

I like the man, don't get me wrong. But he also stated that buying gold around 2000  was a waste of time.

@_date: 2014-03-10 22:49:03
Here are some features bitpay vs coinbase. I guess the most important difference for u would be the fees. 
In the end u have to decide, but I guess when u have a small business, coinbase is more interesting seeing that bitpay is at least $30/month (no extra fees) and coinbase charges 1% on btc - &gt; usd

They can't shut it down, but if all the countries would ban it from accepting (unlikely) bitcoin would crash hard and will stay small forever.

Put bitaddress.org from github on an usb stick
Use a Linux live cd/usb offline
Run bitaddress on Linux live and u have yourself a fairly secure (nothing is 100%) paperwallet 
For the printer part, I use an old(er) printer and print offline. But I use a bip38 password, so the printer part doesn't matter that much 
@_date: 2014-08-11 10:48:15

Things are going fast! 
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:29:27
I like to believe the value would skyrocket. But I think the usd is 'to big to fail' 
And If it does crash, it would be a worldwide disaster I guess.. On the other hand, what do I know. . I'm not an economist 
Edit: I do not use the usd.. Over here we use that other crappy thing called the euro 
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:07:53
They give it to u for free.. But is only 6 microbtc or 0.000006 bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:05:14
I payed the €20/year before sepa existed.. So it's an extra free'ish service.

Euhm well.. I'm not pro or contra DPR and/or Roger Ver, but the 17k retweets say that a lot of people in 'bitcoinland' agree with Roger Ver. 
In the end, it doesn't really matter.. The usd is the most used currency for crime. 
Btw, nothing wrong with trying to raise some money for somebody's defense. Not guilty until... Remember?! 
Edit: I don't think this thread should be downvoted into the ground.. U don't have to agree, but i think OP isn't wrong about the fact that other people who are government minded and aren't libertarians/anarchists are turned off by this kind of things. Remember that the majority is 'pro' government 
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:30:28

@_date: 2014-09-29 12:32:16
So is it really free as they claim or are there some hidden fees? 
Sure I can go and test it myself and I probably will when I need to send money, but for now I don't want to give my info/bank details. It's not that I'm lazy.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:03:01

Switzerland was, like include Singapore, one of the few countries that had hitherto not exchange. Defined data automatically That happened only in the case of a judicial investigation.

It should be as secure, because it is also cold storage. 
Only if malware could get on your usb where u put the unsigned transaction on and can read your private key on the offline device, u could be compromised. Don't even know if this kind of malware exists.

I'm a little late to the party, but.. 
Although I'm also pro bits or any other name. 1/1000000th of a Bitcoin should be the standard. 
But what do you think of keeping the name Bitcoin and do a 1 time 'a stock split'? 
1 change, after that no worries and the (huge) name of Bitcoin stays intact for everyday use.

There are 'rules' when it comes to fees, a lot of times a fee isn't necessary. Sometimes it is and your transaction will be delayed for a few hours/days. 
So most wallets always include a fee because it's easier for the general user. 
Here it is explained much better:

All true, but.. 
For bitcoin as a currency to be useful at larger scale aka mass adoption, the value per coin must be higher. 
Yes it works at $20, $100, but I works better at $1k and up.

Very short:
The 'math' is being solved to decide who finds and broadcasts the next block. Inside the block are the all the transactions for that ~10min. All miners mine for that block and the winner (usually a miningpool) gets 25 bitcoin for it. 
Because people spend computer power and electricity, they get rewarded with bitcoin. 
It's called proof of work. 
The math gets harder/easier depending on the total hash power. It does that, so blocks are find roughly every 10min. 
By mining, Miners also protect the network against double spending. The more hash power, the more secure the network is.

No, even if there was (theoretical) 1 Bitcoin left, you could devide that 1 Bitcoin in enough pieces to make it still workable. So it's not a problem.

Not at all.. They only take BIP0038 private keys. Look it up. 
You have to encrypt the private key yourself before sending them the address! 
Edit: look at the card:  .. Private key with BIP0038 begins with a 6.. Unencrypted ones start with a 5
Edit 2: So even when somebody finds your paper wallet (or whatever u print it on) , they still need a password to gain access to the funds

Economic, normal and priority (3,5,6 cents) with mycelium. 
Send within a minute of each other. 
Normal and prior were confirmed in the next block.. Economic took 3 blocks for the first conformation.

It seems fine for the time being

Not taking any side in this or the block size debate, but that's exactly what they think of r/bitcoin. 
I do visit both and both have valid points. 
I think a lot could be solved be doing a 2mb hf first and sw later/same-ish time. 
Most would be happy, community gets closer together again and work together on a more robust solution.
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:13:07
If the wiki entry is correct: 
On June 10, 2014 Mike Hearn published a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP 64), calling for the addition of "a small P2P protocol extension that performs UTXO lookups given a set of outpoints."[5]On December 27, 2014 Hearn released version 0.10 of the client, with the BIP 64 changes.[6] It was intended to support queries for his Lighthouse crowdfunding platform project.[citation needed]
On June 22, 2015, Gavin Andresen published BIP 101 calling for an increase in the maximum block size. The changes would activate a fork allowing eight MB blocks (with doublings every two years) once 75% of a stretch of 1,000 mined blocks is achieved after the beginning of 2016.[7] The new maximum transaction rate under XT would have been 24 transactions per second.[8]
On August 6, 2015 Andresen's BIP101 proposal was merged into the XT codebase.[9] On August 15, 2015 version 0.11A was released to the public.[10][11] Bip 101 was reverted[12] and the 2-MB blocksize bump of Bitcoin Classic was applied instead.
So yeah, kinda both

From what I read and observed myself (could be a little wrong or somewhat biased):
He was involved almost from the beginning and he took over the development from Satoshi before he left for good. Gavin became the lead developer. 
Forward a few years, the scaling debate came up (2015 I guess). At one point he suggested a (hard) fork to increase the blocksize. At that time it was a jump to 20mb if I remember correctly. (for me) that was the point were 2 groups emerged aka big blockers vs small blockers. Gavin seemed to be a big blocker (still is?) and he developed Bitcoin XT. 
To me personally, I still have much respect for what he has done for Bitcoin. As I'm not a big or small blocker, I don't care for his recent views. 
People here in general might disagree, because his views are not really in line with the core developers vision. 
And then there is the whole Craig ''I am Satoshi'' Wright thing. Not sure what happened there. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:57:33
With the intention of being raised again when necessary.
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:59:48
Well, that's also where a lot of disagreement comes from: 
You are indeed correct that the 1mb size was put there by Satoshi to prevent spam. On the other hand, he also said that we could just remove it if necessary (now would be a great time). This is what big blockers will say that they follow Satoshi's original vision.
The question remains: is Satoshi's vision still the best for today's situation? We've learned a lot since then and segwit, lightening and others might be better now (remains to be seen). This is kinda the small blockers argument. 
I think both have valid points. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:20:37
Less likely than other theories imo, but always possible.. It just works for now, doesn't really matter who made it. 
I am curious though: what if the nsa or similar agency made Bitcoin, could there be a hidden backdoor or is it completely impossible because it would show up in the code? 
I'm not much of a code, do I don't know. 
E: grammar

Follow up question (also paperwallet with bip38):

Is there a risk like what happened to eth and etc where some people lost funds 
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:25:21
20 no, blocksize increase to 2-4mb + segwit + lightning.. Yes that would be my preference.. BUT I'm not as technical as some of the developers, so I can't counter or agree on the coding/scaling part. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 13:12:55

You enter your public address and see what you can redeem.
Before you claim anything, make sure you transfered your bitcoin to an other address. Just so they cannot be hacked/stolen.
@_date: 2016-03-06 18:04:55
Until there is a good working alternative to a block size increase it remains the best solution. I think that is what most big block supporters mean. 
I also believe that big blockers will come around once this is accomplished.. The problem is, for now, that solution is not here (yes I know it's being tested on testnet)

It's a good question and I honestly can't answer this because I lack the knowledge.. 
If someone more technical could explain what can go wrong exactly in case of a fork.. Would be appreciated!
Edit: what I personally would like to know is what are the risks beside the 'side' arguments about: centralization, miners incentives, bandwidth, etc.. (ofcourse I know it's also important) 
But I'm thinking purely about the core of Bitcoin.. Would earthing work the same and we just have bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:42:47
I feel kinda the same.. I'm happy with the price.. But I've been slowly cashing out since ~3k and still doing now. 
I left money on the table doing this, but the rational person in me cannot wrap my head around this 1+ year bull market. 
It seems yesterday that the price was at a depressing $200

@_date: 2017-06-08 13:21:41
It's not 'bad' but why would you pay $7 when 1-1.5 would suffice.. Makes no sense. Mempool is as good as cleared. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:58:08
I also got this email.. Imo, they should let the user (at own risk) set the fee. Kinda like mycelium. 
I've send a few transactions and I always payed around $1.5
What I also don't understand is that the mempool is close to getting cleared (according to some websites) and still fees go up. Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:26:39
Yes 
@_date: 2013-10-14 00:10:13
Well for me and those who know bitcoin, yes! The money I don't 'need' I put into bitcoin. This is exactly why we need bitcoin and/or other crypto currencies, so they can't pull crap like this. Can u actually believe that they want to tax 10% of personal savings, that already have been taxed at 30-50%?! .. It's ridiculous! 
@_date: 2013-10-22 23:43:29
Nice video! I love this guy and I love his idea of a 100k/btc even more ;-) 
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:16:32
Bitcoinity.org/markets 
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:54:42
No it will bring bitcoin from a completely decentralized system to a system with government interference. 
That's not what it's meant to be. 
Btw all this crimes happen also with usd. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:47:52
In short (because yes, it gets asked so many times):
Electrum.org - &gt; tutorials and make an offline wallet on an offline computer and an seedless online wallet on an online pc. 
Read it and u will get it. 
Send PM for questions, but plz read a lot about it first
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:31:52
They just pushed the release to January -_-
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:16:40
I don't get people.. The first time I saw this site I knew it was a scam.
I mean, who would sell bitcoin under the market price? 
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:14:45
Feel bad for the entire world population. 90% or more will never have 1 bitcoin. Even in the 'rich' countries
@_date: 2013-11-09 12:11:59
Btc-e.com or bitstamp 
Withdraw from gox takes a very long time
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:25:01
Yeah, it works fine 
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:53:47
Exactly.. Probably the only argument that makes sense in this whole conversation. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:17:45
Yes if it hits 500+ sell a few so u have your investment back? I did it and it feels so much better when u know it's all pure profit (or at least no loss) for now on. But that's just my opinion Ofcourse. Good luck with it 
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:14:54
It depends.. If u have a little knowledge about investing and spreading your investments I would say max 10%.
But if u really believe in bitcoin a little more..  20-25% (like me) 
But then u have the bitcoin Cowboys who go all in.. Yes u read almost only succes stories, but only because people don't share their failures. 
Just keep in mind the price can drop 50% any day any time.. Although it's getting a little more stable as time goes by. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:28:28
Or u bought Litecoin a month ago @ $3 
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:32:04
Excellent! 
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:28:36
I cashed out what I've invested. So it's zero risk. I'm aware that not possible for everyone 
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:08:37
Yes, but they are usa based.. Deal breaker for me 
@_date: 2013-10-03 02:55:56
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:17:46
Indeed a good price drop.. Still not that interesting I think 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:24:59
Why can't i downvote this to -100.. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:29:46
Meanwhile mycelium minimum fee is still 137sat/byte 
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:55:18
The question is: where do u live? It differs a lot with fees and how easy to withdraw/deposit 
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:53:51
I think because they are a new player and. I myself live in the EU and I use bitstamp. Also sepa deposit (free deposit and €0.9 withdraw. And bitstamp has a high volume
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:46:15
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:53:40
Pls step aside, this bitcoin line is for paying costumers only 
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:17:48
Always with those negative posts.. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:31:09
Give me your bitcoin address and we can look for it 
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:35:25
Don't buy it.. Buy coins instead 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:19:21
If bitcoin holds around 1k, we should start using mbtc. So u would buy 1mbtc / 1usd.
But I also think this rise is to fast 
@_date: 2013-10-26 11:19:28
Think about it, he sells it for a reason. 
At this moment, u would earn $4k/month. But difficulty goes up every 2 weeks (average). Better buy $9k worth of bitcoin. 
Edit: I heard some people's Jupiter only got around 350gh/s. So that's also something to checkout 
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:09:48
So u are from Texas? Fb (fake) says Denver :p funny shit 
@_date: 2013-10-24 14:57:57
The above ^ are very good for Europeans. I myself use bitstamp and Btc-e.. Price @ Btc-e is the cheapest to buy 
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:18:50
If u think this is bad, u gonna be surprised a few times in the future :p 
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:03:12
Haha, perfect for this! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:16:28
Panic selling.. Probly the hearing. 
Hold and don't panic 
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:48:53
No this is not yet a succes.. It's the beginning of a (potential) succes story 
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:36:34
True, it all depends on so many factors. Theoretical it's not impossible, but for now I think it's not realistic. On the other hand, when bitcoin was $1 nobody would have dared to say it would be $200 some day (now). 
It doesn't hurt to dream once in while ;-) 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:04:13
Indeed it's an old video! 
@_date: 2013-10-20 09:34:39
Why not bitcent? 
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:42:31
@_date: 2013-10-19 13:57:44
Haha, indeed
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:45:13
For Europe use bitstamp or Btc-e and deposit via sepa (it's free) 
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:24:36
U can mine all 'sha-256 coins' 
Bitcoin, Peercoin and a few others. 
No litecoin..
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:14:15
It could be used for that.. It has the same size. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:17:59
U could be right.. Doesn't matter that much.. I'm in for the long run 
@_date: 2013-10-14 02:06:02
Obvious scam site.. Who's gonna sell lower than market price!? -_-
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:22:23
Electrum.. Use your old pc for an offline wallet and your new one for an online wallet. Very secure. 
Read more @ electrum.org 
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:57:14
There are non actually, it's only opinions from different ppl. 
The idea is good.. The success is not guaranteed. 
I do own bitcoin, because I believe in it's potential 
edit: this is a video with some very good arguments: 
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:31:11
Easy like that
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:38:24
Your offline wallet is your usb. 
U have to be able to boot Linux from the usb stick and install electrum on it. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 01:38:31
Btc-e.. Still the cheapest 
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:36:27
All4btc.com maybe? 
@_date: 2013-10-03 23:50:33
Soon, maybe it's already there. 
I think the better question is: when will we find out there is a new SR :) 
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:49:20
Can't really agree.. They dump a few thousand and buy back in at a lower price = profit. No? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:02:16
I think this is an important difference: tulips collapsed just one time with no recovery. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:09:32
So u are getting this information from a 2 weeks data? It's only been 2 weeks since the price is 180-230.
Read about it and if u like the concept and u think it will succeed, buy bitcoins. Otherwise don't invest 
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:39:30
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:36:18
There are a few good dates actually: beste one is 3rd or 9th of January I guess 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:43:15
It's true.. I like the altcoins (for the wrong reason) for making good profits.. I bought ppc @ 0.21 usd.. Now it's ~3.5usd 
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:59:47
It would get cleared for sure with 2mb.. Maybe not in a few months, now definitely. Backlog is around 10k now, coming down from 150k+
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:50:02
U could be right.. What would u do when something so nice, that it will probably close down the bank industry ;-) 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:51:40
Use electrum or armory.. So u can have a cold and a hot wallet. Far out the best security imo. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 08:06:30
Wow, that's crazy.. here in belgium, all EU tranfers are free. Kinda crazy u have to pay so much fee. 
If it would change anything i would buy them for u UK guys, but to send me the money would be also 15gbp fee probably? And ofcourse u should trust a stranger. :)
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:43:47
Yes it's called the blockchain(.info) 
It has every transaction ever made stored. So u cannot dubble spend coin or duplicate. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:49:52
I don't know about bitcoin, but if u want decent 'western' food, u should go and visit 'the blue frog' it's a bar/restaurant with very nice ppl and the hamburgers are so good
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:18:03
Instead of this setup, u can also go for a 'raspberry pi' less then €50, but u have to install the OS yourself. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:35:24
Yes it's the best for Europeans.. No deposit fee and €1 withdraw fee using SEPA
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:44:55
Exactly, that's something a lot of ppl forget. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:43:41
I hope u win! ;) 
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:11:43
It's not like I don't like the idea, but we have computer/smartphone with the live price. Where is the advantage over these? Maybe I'm over looking something? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:49:27
But if they don't log, they can't give anything up.. I'm not sure, but i don't think the Vpn company can get sued for that. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 13:13:39
Satoshi nakamoto, an individual or group that started/invented Bitcoin was the first miner in 2008. He got every block reward at that time until a second, third and so on joined to network and started mining. When Satoshi started Bitcoin, he posted his idea of Bitcoin onto a forum with cryptograph enthusiasts. His first post: 
More of the first conversations about Bitcoin here: 
A man named Hal finney was (possible) the first outsider to have used the Bitcoin network.. He is also credited doing the first ever transaction: Satoshi to Hal finney. 
At that time Bitcoin had no value, but a select group of people liked the idea and started mining. 
I'm not sure if I'm being 100% accurate, but that's my understanding of what happened 
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:34:31
No, I send 0.1 from my bitcoin-qt adres to electrum address (received) 
So balance electrum address: 0.1 
Now I want to send 0.005 to my Android phone's address and than I get this message 
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:15:28
I'm not sure about astrill.. I don't know them well enough.. But I heard they require a cellphone when signing up (don't know if this is actually true) which is a big no no! There it ends for me. 
Whatever u do, stay away from hide my ass! They hand over data like a p*$$y when the government asks for it. Happened with some member(s) of lulzsec. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:25:23
The thing is: I too always say it's not profitable anymore.. But then I look at my mini rig - &gt; 3.3gh/s (lol) that I have for about 4 months and it still gives me 'profit'.. At this moment it mines 1.44 usd/day and it covers my electricity cost and I have some left. 
It's almost nothing, but as long as it keeps earning more than the electricity cost, I'll just keep it running. 
Btw with the recent prices I actually got ROI 
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:06:47
Should not take that long.. Normally 5-30min. But if they send it without fee, than it can take a very long time 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:04:59
Who Downvoted this? He's right. 
Mtgox, bitstamp, Btc-e, etc all have it. 
Only coinbase doesn't, but it's not really an exchange 
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:25:43
^ this 
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:48:51
Depends on the location. For Europeans it's very easy and free to deposit 
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:26:06
Yes, can't seem to find what I'm doing wrong. Here a pic of it: 
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:44:45
Yes exactly.. And selling is personal, but i don't see myself selling very soon or there has to be an obvious bubble, the I will try to sell at the top and buy again later 
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:47:39
^ this
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:06:39
Where are u from? 
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:52:44
About 1 mouse click I guess :/
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:37:36
Is this address yours? There is 0.04.. btc in it 
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:17:53
Scam! 
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:54:55
Use electrum wallet.. So u don't need to download the blockchain 
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:58:06
25% discount and free delivery in... 2015
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:23:46
Bitstamp has a more professional experience, but Btc-e is also good, it just looks cheap 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:52:57
2-3 business days 
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:48:12
No really, it's in your best interest not to mine with your computer. 
I have 10 usb asic miners running @ 3300mh/s and I mine a little more than the electricity costs. 
PM me if u are interested in the usb asic miner. I have some left. But I'm gonna say it like it is and don't try to sell u smtg that will disappoint u. 
Instead of buying mining gear, buy bitcoin. Let's say I sell u 10 usb miners for 1 bitcoin or $200. U probably never mine 1btc with it. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:33:42
Yes electrum(.org) is a good one. 
Read their manual on cold storage so your coins will be safe
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:02:26
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:24:37
That I don't know.. I did verification half a year ago. But it changed since then. If u want € for it.. Look at Localbitcoins.com and look for someone who wants to pay in euro. 
No verification needed
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:01:37
If u panic sell, that means u don't have faith in the long run.. I never sell, I only (try to) buy low 
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:17:54
Scam! 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:07:36
Lol, hide my ass. Should be banned from every decent Vpn list. They log everything 
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:13:36
True, they convert euro to dollar at daily rate. But I think there was no additional fee for that. I looked up the convert rate and I got exactly the same amount 
@_date: 2013-10-03 02:58:04
But if u only want to buy this once and u don't want to learn about it. PM me and u can buy from me if u want 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:09:12
That's it, I'm quiting my job in January 2015.. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:46:57
I kinda agree with OP.. So instead of 1btc, u would have 1000 btc. 
I think it's interesting when we hit 1k/btc
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:40:57
It happens sometimes.. It's an average every 10 min. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:23:59
Because bitcoin is not a company (although I heard some people think it is) 
@_date: 2013-11-03 12:40:13
I (as probably many others) suggested it in an email I wrote to them. 
If they would add bitcoin, I would donate. Good move from libreoffice team
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:25:21
U should join multiple.in.. Then u would always mine for the most profitable coin. For asic, now they mine bitcoin, a week ago it was Peercoin. 
Btw, scrypt coins like feather coin need an gpu to mine it 
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:54:19
Idk.. It's roughly every 2 weeks 
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:32:58
I can relate.. I just can't figure it out if that's a good thing or not. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:35:18
A good start are the 'bitcoin 101 blackboard' vids here is 1 of them: 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:51:26
The tab deposit - &gt; bitcoin and than they give u a bitcoin adres to deposit bitcoins. 
Same for withdraw @ Btc-e.com. 
Withdraw bitcoin and then fill in the address (your wallet or in this case your bitstamp address) . 
I don't mind.. Have more questions? PM me
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:27:17
Btc-e.com also has sepa.. It's Russian, but bank is in eastern europe
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:34:26
I posted this yesterday on a simular question. I think it sums it up with a few words. 
Question was: $250 seems expensive to buy, should I wait? 
I had the same feeling when they were $100.. Seems so cheap now. 
Next year ppl will be all like: why didn't I buy @ 250 
Or remember the suckers who bought in @ 250 
I hope it's the first one. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:27:26
The thing I don't get is why don't people use cold storage in combination with an watch only wallet? It's fairly simple and it's so secure 
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:19:47
Do u really want to beg?! U can do jobs for bitcoin.. Then u are actively contributing to bitcoin and u keep your dignity 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:02:33
Yes makes sense.. Only way it would work is for the mempool to clear all the way, which probably won't happen
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:33:59
Looks like me last night -_- ooh to drunk again 
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:58:41
When u tell them u have/had 1 entire bitcoin, they side right of the couch! 
I don't know what will happen if u tell them u have a 100 or a 1000 of them ;-) 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:19:48
^ this
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:48:14
That's weird.. It's been a while since I deposited there. Bitstamp is free, I did a deposit last week 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:40:24
It's been discussed a lot already. It will come some day. Not as soon as u want I guess. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:53:36
The limit is just how the code is written. We can adjust it, but i forgot what it takes to do that. 
something else I was thinking about. Just my 2 cents. But maybe when (if) bitcoin reaches $1k/btc or 1$ = 1milli bitcoin we should rename the milli unit just bitcoin. 
So if u have 10btc now, it would become 10000btc.
I know that is not exactly what u asked for, but i see some problem with the names of units.. I don't like to say 35 milli bitcoin the whole time in the future 
@_date: 2013-10-19 06:21:06
Scam! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:24:06
I think this could be very accurate! Written just now 
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:33:32
Did u have them in cold storage? 
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:56:18
Lol, I didn't know that. Never used gox. 
Anyway, we share that idea then
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:07:03
Saw this yesterday.. Nice vid! 
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:43:04
True.. But they say that they only log an email address and payment options. No logs of your traffic. And it's Canada based, not USA Ofcourse. 
But yes I get your point. Nothing is 100% secure
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:56:56
Haha, mij gistere ook. 
- me too yesterday. 
I gave him the same answer and also told him to make the documentary about the bitcoin system and don't make it look like a 'get rich quick' documentary. He told me he really wants to do it, but has problems convincing his superiors 
@_date: 2013-09-30 10:22:26
Than I suggest buying on localbitcoins.com.. To be sure, do a person to person transaction in a crowded area. I did it and it went all smooth. 
If u don't find an other way to buy, PM and maybe I can help u out a little cheaper 
Grtz 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:00:10
Won't be for a while.. He has to approval from the 'eindredactie' 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:30:14
Yes we can
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:31:43
Just buy bitcoin.. 9/10 it's better then buying mining equipment. 
Take it from a former bitcoin miner.
I currently mine ppc (more profitable atm) @ 3,5 gh/s and I make a little more than the electricity cost. 
i will never buy a miner again or it has to be a very good price. Even then, probably not. 
Edit: if u just want to mine for the network support, buy 10 usb asic miner or so ( a piece) .. U will never Roi, but u support a good cause. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:12:05
First: your country? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:43:18
It's actually a very good concept. Read about it. But atm I just mine it because it's more profitable then bitcoin. 
Once I have 100 or more ppc, I convert them into bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:53:39
Nobody knows
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:32:29
I use bitstamp the most, but Btc-e.com is also legit.. It just doesn't look very professional. I used both before 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:25:09
Yeah, it was just 'natte vinger werk' 
It's probably more, it just feels like there is not to much interest in cc in belgium. 
We'll see in 5 years, everybody is gonna know it or a few people will say: oh remember the fools who believed in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 09:01:01
Eventually: everything! 
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:59:29
Still nothing.. I'm gonna try to figure it out and I'll let u know. 
Tnx anyway 
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:25:49
Use a Vpn.. Problem solved
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:25:02
Cold storage using electrum or armory 
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:51:17
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:51:56
Could be a keylogger. I feel for u, but i have 90% in cold storage. The rest online wallet. Something to think about in the future
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:36:56
Ppl continue to go out of the mining business until the difficulty drops enough so it becomes profitable again. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:30:44
Where r u from? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:28:21
Euh well.. I kinda like the idea, but i don't know if that's possible to realize.
After a long time you would have so many shared wallets 
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:50:02
It is written in the source code that transactions are irreversible.. 
Read here: bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:05:46
Yes, I would hand over the logs IF I had some.. But the point is that they make misleading advertising. And If they log, half of the value of a Vpn service is gone. Anyway, mine is with a company that isn't required by law to keep logs. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:53:29
If this is true, then u are a very good person. I consider myself a good person.. But I really don't know if I would cash out or not. 
Indeed, i hope they reward u with Let's say smtg about 10%
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:57:30
If u are serious about this, do it via a crowd founding site. 
Your not gonna get donations here for a random project, which u can't prove u are really doing. 
Btw Song is 4 years old.. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:51:45
Exactly the same over here, but i stopped thinking about it. I just cashed out a few coins to get my investment back and now I just wait and see. Looking at the charts 10 times a day just doesn't make sense unless u day trade, which I only do with some few alt when I have time 
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:38:47
Nobody knows.. If u ask me it will rise more and then have a serious correction. But that's just speculation 
@_date: 2013-10-19 22:23:31
Sepa bitstamp.net   
Sepa Btc-e.com 
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:03:01
U probably already know this, but be aware your investment could easily half overnight.. On the more positive side, it also could double as easily. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:08:18
Funny :) 
@_date: 2013-10-26 10:51:46
Wauw, ben weeral trots om Belg te zijn :/ Wth is wrong with some people?! 
@_date: 2013-10-16 00:52:07
Lol yes. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:09:54
Well I think u know the answer already.. Try to explain your wife in a simple way what bitcoin is and why u believe it will grow.
I too believe in bitcoin (a bitliever? ;)) but don't invest what u can't afford to lose. 
Btw u don't have to have hundreds of coin. If u believe it will succeed 10-50 should be ok. Well the more the better, but u get my point 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:04:36
Video is from the April bubble 
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:54:28
Download electrum(.org) and u don't need to download the blockchain 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:36:37
I have an account there, but at the time, there was almost no volume 
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:50:39
I think the most important fact is that although there have been crashes.. The price was always higher after the crash than before. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:58:01
That other dude doesn't know what he is talking about. - &gt;
The government can shut down bitcoin whenever they want. -_-
How can u come on a show to discus bitcoin if u don't even know how it works. What a douche 
@_date: 2013-10-24 14:54:50
Yes it sometimes happens.. Once I waited 8h for 3btc. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:13:39
It will give u a general thought of bitcoin to begin with. For the rest, u will need hours, days to understand it. And make it weeks if u want to be a 'pro' 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:42:06
Nice.. I'm just holding because I don't want the stress of trading. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:42:40
10min to 1hour depending on when the next block is found.. But in general it's +/- 10 min
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:10:12
Yes he is very intense :-) but I was into bitcoin before I listened to him. He just confirms what I already knew. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 06:29:16
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:14:23
I completely understand ;-) I was 'lucky' to wake up and the price was 175, so I bought 1 more
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:54:24
Not exotic or special, but i bought a Vpn service with it. So my Vpn account is not linked in anyway with my identity. Ofcourse I used a anonymous email service too. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:12:31
I like it! It's something to think about. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:37:16
If u have sepa bank deposit use bitstamp or Btc-e.. No deposit fee, very low withdraw fee. Transfer is 2-3 days 
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:24:14
SEPA to bitstamp.. 3-4 days 
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:35:26
Ironically (it's the whole purpose of btc) u can't sell off quick unless u are a verified costumer on an exchange. I also live in europe and use bitstamp.net 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:22:47
Cashed out 10% of my coins to get my investment back.. Did it a few days ago. Feels good actually, from here on no losses, only potential profit 
Btw, yes it takes down the stress ;) 
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:16:29
+2 eh
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:08:16
Try Localbitcoins.com
U can sell to someone nearby u in person.. So direct cash for bitcoin. 
That will be the fastest way. Or convince the store to accept bitcoin ;-) it's good for the community 
@_date: 2013-10-14 02:10:33
Nice, I like it! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:46:22
If this is true, I'm very sorry for u. But why aren't 90% of your coins in cold storage? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:57:30
^ this 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:06:40
Download it on a pc connected to the Internet.. Put it on a (different and formatted) usb and install electrum on your Linux usb. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:42:59
5-6 weeks ago it was around 120-130..
It's just a correction right now. After that the market should 'stabilize' and we can prepare for an other rally in a few weeks/months. 
I'm no pro, just my opinion 
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:38:08
Well, to be honest.. I could go to 1000 in a month, it could go to 100.
It's high risk investing. Don't spend what u can't afford to lose. 
Selling bitcoins and retrieve fiat is not that hard, but i can only speak for myself (Europe) 
@_date: 2013-10-26 11:38:00
It's possible that u get your money out of it, maybe not. So why take the risk when u van just buy bitcoins. 
@ Btc-e.com u get 51.4 bitcoin voor $9k 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:25:18
Even better.. Before the rally it was $100-130.. So for now, still 500%.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:46:29
I'm not gonna say it's not true.. But I deposited €500 and I got $676 and some change and it was the same rate as the Google rate..
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:14:16
Yes, but it's just an idea. I posted about it a month ago. It's not only for Germany.. It's for 15 European countries, including mine. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 13:34:39

I don't know for us.. I live in europe
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:54:27
In Euro.. I don't know about GBP, but bitstamp converts € into $ at the 'best' rate 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:16:30
Exactly! 
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:30:36
Number of coin has nothing to do with the fact the price can drop hard in a day. That's all I meant 
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:48:12
It doesn't adjust every block.. If I'm correct it's every 2016 Blocks 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:13:38
Nog beter.. Ik woon daar. Gade zaterdag ook? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:14:11
I buy stuff with bitcoin.. Food delivery, Vpn services. But it will take time to buy with bitcoin in your average grocery store. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:25:50
Merchants can use bitpay, which instantly convert bitcoin into fiat without a fluctuation risk. Problem solved 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:49:33
Tell her: I could have bought u 1 barbie today. But u will be able to buy 10 next year! 
Although I like what u are trying to do. I think she won't like it. No 10 year old wants something to safe. They want toys they can play with now. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:50:53
Try 1 of these 2:
- electrum.org
- bitcoinarmory.com
I use electrum and once u get how it works, it's actually very easy. 
PM me if u have any questions 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:31:10
Yes, export private key in one of the tabs. But Google the proces 
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:01:20
No to all! Just buy bitcoin/altcoin
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:50:12
Ok, that's a decent explanation! 
Edit: just one thing, if it triggers a panic sell, wouldn't it work then? 
@_date: 2013-10-03 02:50:59
Localbitcoins.com is legit, but u deal directly with the seller, so use escrow. 
U can also look for a seller nearby and do the transaction in person. U should have a wallet on your phone then to make it easy
But depending your country, it's better to buy at an exchange like bitstamp.net or mtgox.com or btc-e.com. 
There are many others, but it all depends on where u live to choose the best one. 
And yes u need to download a wallet. For example bitcoin-qt or electrum wallet. There are a few more. 
But for more info, just Google bitcoin and there is a lot of info about it 
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:03:06
Lol really?! Look at the charts for longer then 2 months.. It just increased in value from $12 to now around $850 in 1 year 
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:43:35
Yeah, then I don't know if u can keep asic miners away. Good luck 
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:09:44
^ this.. Or use an usb and run Linux on it with electrum as your offline wallet 
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:19:34
Congrats! I'm not there yet, but it's getting closer. But I'm not gonna cash our for it. I believe it's gonna be bigger  and I don't have troubles paying my house monthly with fiat. As long if u don't have financial problems I wouldn't cash out to many. I only cashed out what I put into bitcoin. 
Anyway good luck with it 
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:37:18
+1 :) 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:49:39
Just a few minutes for me about an hour, maybe 2 hours ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:17:15
Indeed.. Use the search.. But in short: moving fiat fast and profitable 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:21:02
Bitcoin is actually very easy.. But u have to learn a little 
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:07:45
Best payed pizza delivery boy/girl EVAR! :-D 
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:08:01
What kind of amount are u looking for? 
And I hope u know, there are already a lot of bitcoin casino's. What makes yours attractive? 
@_date: 2013-10-13 23:01:27
You're reasoning is correct.. 10 different addresses is 'safer' but imo if u do a propper cold storage of the 100, they should be safe. Or 90 coldstorage and 10 on a well secured online wallet for daily uses. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:04:29
I use the €15 plan.. I like it and it's enough for a month for me
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:05:06
Is there any reason for a crash? Every crash in the past, had a reason. 
So as long if there are no rumors, it will stay 'stable' but there always will be fluctuations. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:52:13
We all got the same profit / btc. Only I don't own that much. Maybe one day I can see that kind of profit ;) 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:30:07
Lol I may hope u are jokin' right? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:00:58
U can gain money if the price rises.. U lose money when the price drops. 
That's basically it price wise. Now start reading a lot and u will see it is so much more. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:02:27
Use electrum and store them on your hdd. And make an offline wallet combined with an online wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:43:03
Btc-e.com is good for btc/altcoin trading. Doesn't look good, but it works fine for me and deposit/withdraw is relatively fast
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:23:31
Yes it is.. Look for the Section on cold storage 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:31:59
Looks more like a rig for scrypt mining 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:26:11
Based on speculation?! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:17:10
Hmm let me see.. 
Btw I would suggest using offline storage using electrum. They are safe (cold storage) and u can still spend them. Imo better then paper wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:47:20
It depends.. If I had +500 coins, I wouldn't regret selling 40 at a lower price. Ofcourse if u only had 50 than it hurts 
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:02:31
^ this.. I wouldn't know the answer for question 3 either 
But it's a good thing the ask yourself some questions instead of rushing into it 
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:18:40
Which country? Just use bitstamp or Btc-e 
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:26:35
I'm from Europe, so can't help u 
@_date: 2013-10-24 01:21:04
Yes I am serious.. The question was: what would u do if it would happen.. Well that's what I would do. 
Is it gonna get there, I don't know and I'm not gonna depend on it 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:22:32
I kinda agree.. Although I wish not Ofcourse 
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:54:58
^ this
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:04:06
I was.. It's only a few months ago. Seems so long 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:49:43
Hmm, then I actually don't know. Try closing and restarting multibit. If that doesn't help, PM me
@_date: 2013-10-28 08:45:59
Whoops, I 'lost' them boss! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:06:19
I bought most at the exact same time. It was tempted to do the same as u.. But I told myself, buy n hold. Glad I did ;) only regret is that I sold my Litecoin @ 0.014 o_O .. Just days before the rally. In other words buy and hold every coin unless you're a natural daytrader 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:26:56
Well I suggest one of two dates:
The day the white paper was released or the day the bitcoin network 'came alive' 
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:37:53
That's so wrong.. Sepa (from belgium) to bitstamp has always worked without a problem. 
They should not decide where u send your money.. I even think that it's illegal to do that. But I don't know the 'bank laws' in spain
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:11:05
Lol me too
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:04:57
True, we are still in the early stage of bitcoin adoption. IF it's gonna be a succes, 1 bitcoin will be worth a lot. 
But we still have a long way to go 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:24:42
Haha no.. I meant it. Your bitcoin address is public. That's the address people use to send u coins. 
U just can't share your private key. 2 different things 
U can see every random address :
I don't even know who owns it, but u can check every transaction ever made. So u can also see yours if u input your adres in there
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:36:19
Sorry to hear that, but it's gone. 
For the future, learn about electrum and/or armory for 'cold storage' 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:25:17
Also watch Peercoin.. It tripled it's value in a few weeks 
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:54:12
True, u should be! Try the offline wallet, no (online) risk
 U find the info on the electrum site
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:51:18
Highly unlikely 
@_date: 2013-10-22 23:50:59
Yes, I get that.. Still very nice. 
But 13k is 13k, no matter what your situation is. 
I'm still thinking about it and I still don't know if I would take it or not. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:30:50
Maybe u should get the 'bitcoin paranoid' android app. It gives live prices of gox, bitstamp and Btc-e and u can set an alarm to notify u when it rises/drops x-amount of value 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:55:45
Use the search.. It gets asked about 10 times a day 
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:48:21
No, it's a good thing. Spread the word! 
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:07:12
Ok thanks.. Normally I'm good with this kind of things, but i don't wanna make a stupid mistake and lose my coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:29:59
Yes, but i also think it's intrinsic value comes from features like: low fee costs, no 3rd party rules, no government restrictions, ppl without proper banking systems, can do it themselves now (Africa, some Asian countries) And the fact u can cross boarders with a few millions (if u have it ofcourse) 
Correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 22:20:58
Yes indeed. It's a free market. If u have 25k bitcoin, u were probably a very early adopter and u believed in the potential and it payed off, even now. 25k btc would be +/- 325k 
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:28:57
It surprised me to see bitcoin 'so soon' on food delivery services. 
Gwn lekker bestellen en je hoeft je luie zetel niet meer uit om geld te gaan afhalen ;) 
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:26:52
It just needs time.. Almost all new things/technologies have a s-curve when it comes to adoption. TV, Internet, mobile phones... Even things like Facebook n Twitter. 
Imo we are still at the beginning of the s-curve. So the mass adoption still has to come. But it's getting there more and more, especially this last few months. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:19:03
Good job! I hope others will follow quickly, especially the exchanges! 
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:51:26
This! Made me laugh too! 
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:57:21
UK seems difficult from what I hear. 
Anyway, if u can use SEPA than use bitstamp.net or btc-e.com 
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:05:34
No, I'm from belgium.. Sepa is free over here. So €0 deposit and €0.9 for a withdraw. Bitstamp stakes a 0.20% transaction fee on every transaction. 
Verification was only 1 day. But it's 6months ago, so I wouldn't know for now. Just make sure u provide them with the right info. 
Edit: transaction fee is actually 0.50%, not 0.20% .. It goes down when u buy more. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:25:47
What a ass that guy
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:29:18
Localbitcoins.com.. Make a trade in person I thought someone. Meet at a public place! 
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:05:31
Hmm, I can't agree with that.. 
I think a better analogy would be: bitcoin is like torrents. Both are peer to peer and the government (although they tried) can't stop torrents. 
Just my 2 cents, correct me if I'm wrong 
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:00:52
Done! It was very short though. 
Vind het vrij algemeen, maar als dat genoeg voor je is, ok :-) vorige keer heb ik een survey van 20 pagina's ingevuld 
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:25:11
I agree with u, I was just saying that it will take a while for it to become the new standard. 
An other option imo is name milli btc just btc and move 3 decimals. So if u have 1 btc now, it would become 1000 btc, Ofcourse 1 btc will only cost around 0.80usd 
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:38:27
I don't know, but it doesn't look very good I guess.. Government and banks, the 2 biggest 'rivals' of bitcoin. 
I would suprise me if we would hear positive things. 
I'm gonna be ready on Monday to buy some cheap(er) coins 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:33:43
Haha lol.. I wasn't at your comment yet and I was thinking Bitcat! 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:52:27
True! Very good video's
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:33:20
I am actually waiting for like an hour -_- so I can order food! 
Edit: a few seconds after this post it came true! 
@_date: 2013-10-26 13:11:50
Every exchange.. As long as u don't have to deposit/withdraw fiat, u can go anywhere 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:46:39
True, true.. But zerocoin is here for the rescue.. Look it up 
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:05:53
I don't see it as an option on pizza.be.. Would be nice though.
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:41:03
I kinda agree that it swings to much.. But bitcoin is so young.. IF bitcoin survives (and I think it will) than we will see more stabilization in about 10 years. Let's say around 10k ;-) 
@_date: 2013-10-16 01:43:06
Done! Good survey! GL
@_date: 2013-10-24 01:53:25
I think there a already a few thousand lost. By the end, there maybe will only be 20 million coins 
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:48:17
Then bitstamp is perfect for that.. Once verified, u sell bitcoins in seconds 
@_date: 2013-09-30 10:11:43
No, don't buy mining equipment, unless u have a very good deal and/or free power.  Myself I bought 1 of the first usb asic miner. I have a rig of 10 (so 3.3gh/s) and I become useless within a few months. Looking back on it, I had better bbought 5 btc instead of spending $500 on equipment. And that's not even that much money. Imagine your $3300  machine becomes useless in 2-3 months, then your looking at a decent loss. Look at the last 2 difficulty raises.. If I'm correct it was 60% increase in a month! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:53:47
Yes maybe.. But bitcoin is scammers paradise.. Just be careful 
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:38:24
I also agree.. Here is the proof for the skeptics among us: 
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:34:25
Could be, I didn't want to do the math, so I took a very big error rate ;) 
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:08:16
Dunno.. Was accepted the first time 
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:30:54
It will go down, but imo i don't think it will crash below 300. (no facts, just my thought) 
As long as the value after the 'bubble' is more than before, then I'm fine with it. Just hold and don't panic. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:04:20
Nobody can answer that question correct.. U could make a BIG profit on 1 of the altcoins.. But u could loose BIG on them too. Same goes for bitcoin (although it's the most 'stable'). Could be 300 next month, maybe 400 or 100. Nobody knows. 
Don't invest money u can't afford to lose! 
And imo.. You are not gonna get a car and daily expenses with a $1000 investment. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:40:29
Yes. It's legit. They have a EU bank in Slovenia. Sending/withdrawing money 3-4 days. Bitcoin instantly. 
Verifying was easy for me (1 day) , but i heard some ppl had some problems. So good luck
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:20:15
I get your point of view.. But how are u gonna explain to people who probably never heard of it, how to use it. 
But if they know it and know how to use it, yes then it's a good idea
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:37:43
The math is ok, but u have 2.1 quadrillion satoshis
1 bitcoin = 100.000.000 Satoshis 
There will only be 21million bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:43:41
Yes it's the most common 'symbol' 
But XBT is the official ISO currency code. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:17:43
Good idea, but it already exists ;-) 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:43:02
Really, how can anybody know that? 
It will go up and down.. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:08:35
Update wallet and should be fine. If not, download electrum(.org) and import your private key there. 
Advantage of electrum is that u don't need to download the whole blockchain 
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:29:07
Yes it's copied 
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:40:17
The same as u buy a whole one. 
U can buy the amount u want on one of the exchanges. Bitstamp / mtgox / btc-e
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:54:11
Although I believe in bitcoin's future. It's just to risky to put everything in bitcoin. Diversify a little, just in case.
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:22:44
Yes indeed.. I did that also for a moment, but it takes a lot of time and stress, so I stopped doing it 
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:44:21
Don't pay taxes on it unless you are withdrawing big amounts. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:07:43
Lol, I'm from belgium too (antwerp) 
Definitely use bitstamp.. Free sepa deposit (3 days) and only €1 withdraw. 
I use bitstamp all the time. It's legit 
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:22:42
XBT = bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:04:19
Yes, I'm glad other Belgians think the same way. Indeed telefacts wants sensation style documentaries. 
I also offered to help as much as needed to make a good documentary with the right facts. 
Btw: 7 januari is het bitcoin meeting in Gent. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:48:53
Smtg like that yes 
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:50:35
I would start using electrum (electrum.org) it's easy and has better features then bitcoin-qt for the moment. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:03:18
Best tip: do it ASAP! 
@_date: 2013-10-26 13:13:40
Btc China has no fees for the moment 
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:01:49
Ok I understand. Hmm that will be difficult. I want $, € or btc for it
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:09:49
Electrum.org .. It does the same as armory 
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:52:39
I never used escrow, because I never needed it before. But look around for a good one 
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:27:53
No, I didn't do that yet. :) Have to get home for that 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:13:38
Imo: don't buy litecoin now.. There is a pump going on. It went from 2usd to 8usd in 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 01:18:44
1 million would be a good start. I would stop doing my day job, but i would still try to make some more $ and invest wisely, but with a little less risk
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:42:15
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:16:46
Yes it will go true.. Could be 10min to a few hours 
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:14:28
2-3 weeks ago for about a few hours the price on Btc-e was higher than bitstamp's. But indeed it doesn't happen that often 
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:53:40
Don't use online wallets! It's not safe enough. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:00:54
If u do it correct it's secure from online theft 
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:11:33
It happened today! @ Btc-e.com the price dropped to about $155
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:03:41
Theoretical it's possible, but 0 is still also possible. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:31:57
0.02 = 6 usd
0.2 = 60 usd
@_date: 2013-11-15 12:14:40
Tweet it to Matt stone and Trey Parker :)? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:28:16
Hell yeah, I'll take the one next to u 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:01:56
I think only a few 100, maybe 1000 people actually use bitcoin in Belgium. When I mention bitcoin, people generally have no clue what it is. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:45:32
6 usb miners + usb fan takes to much power for it to work good at the same time. Look at the specs of your hub 
@_date: 2013-10-14 00:19:14
Yes it is.. I live in europe and they are not gonna take my savings. Although most of my savings are in real estate.. I have a few % stored in bitcoin. 
I think this and the news about the dollar will make bitcoin more popular then ever. 
If the governments keep pulling this crap, it will drive more and more people to bitcoin/(future) altcoins
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:16:45
Btc-e.com and bitstamp.net for Europeans 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:36:09
In theory u don't have to pay a transaction fee, but it will take hours to get true 
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:06:06
Just a badge/token.. The Viking helmet is their symbol, with the bitcoin sign in it. On the back it says: welcome to the pioneer club of the bitcoin vikings 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:54:01
If u don't log anything, u can't give them anything right? In some countries they don't need to log by law, so I will choose a Vpn service who operated from such countries. I know what u mean, but still, it's false advertising. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:56:33
yes, that's it!
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:45:36
I agree.. It makes no sense, because It remains the same.. but ppl rather buy 100 mBTC instead of 0.1 btc for ~100 usd
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:25:55
Nobody knows.. Ppl asked this  and at 1k usd. 
It could be the best decision of your life, could be the worst. Invest what u are willing to loose. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:07:11
Everything is possible. But not likely I guess. It will get there, but not by December 2013.
But I will be happy if it does ;) 
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:46:48
I have to say I like ppc more then Litecoin, but i hold both
@_date: 2013-10-11 09:40:01
From the EU to bitstamp.. Because it's free to deposit and only €0.9 to withdraw. Far out the best option for the EU 
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:16:25
It cost u less than €10.. I have a usb with Linux + electrum as my offline system and a seedless online wallet on my laptop that is connected to the Internet. Making the Linux usb is not that hard, but u need some knowledge. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:12:48
Yes.. Just send them to the address given by criptsy. 
Just be careful, I heard cryptsy is having some problems with deposit n withdraws 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:29:57
Right now Btc-e to buy and bitstamp to sell.. Price difference is around 100usd
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:06:31
Usd/euro/yen and so on 
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:19:56
Not that much, but a basic website is not that hard.
@_date: 2013-10-24 01:21:39
Something like this yes
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:58:08
If u have sepa bank transfer (which I think u have) use Btc-e or bitstamp or kraken.. They all have sepa deposit/withdraw and the fees are very low. 
I myself (also europe) use bitstamp and I never had any problems 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:53:56
Ok, but it's because of the media (good or bad) bitcoin price skyrocketed. 
Like it or not, that's the way the reach your average joe
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:02:49
Maybe not for u.. But think of people working in a foreign country and want to send money back home. I think for those ppl it's the best option instead of getting ripped of 5-10% using western Union etc. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:22:08
Yes that's what I and a lot of others do. 
If u have 1btc, theoretically only 21 million ppl will have more or the same amount. So if bitcoin succeeds and has a worldwide adoption, 1 btc (or 100 million satoshi) will be a lot! 
@_date: 2013-10-13 22:34:45
Exactly! 
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:22:41
True, I use bitstamp with sepa and it's always been 2-3 business days to deposit. Never had a problem with them
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:34:46
True, if anything the fiat system is more an 'IOU' system than bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:56:07
Sell them for cash at Localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:40:20
Was thinking the same 
@_date: 2013-10-26 12:48:14
Coinbase? I don't use it (live in europe) 
I use bitstamp, but i don't know if that's an option for the USA 
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:57:52
Don't buy @ gox.. Price is too high. Best buy right now is btc-e.com.. 
It's easy to deposit (for Europeans that is) price @ this moment $187.5 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:20:00
I ordered a few times with bitcoin from pizza.be.. Works like a charm! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:32:51
In one year: Aaaaand it's gone 
@_date: 2013-10-24 01:33:17
Yes, if u want to spend 250k a year.. then a million won't do it. 
I don't spend 250k a year, so value of money is different between us. 
But the million is ofcourse not enough to just sit back and relax. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:08:09
Use bitstamp.net .. Perfect for Europeans. €1 withdraw fee. 
I use it all the time
@_date: 2013-10-01 21:44:27
I don't know about the locations, but 2 good ones (almost none to no logging) : private internet acces &amp;  btguard
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:56:51
Yes and no.. I would do it if I had something to hide or if the gov started making ridiculous rules (like the EMF wants to tax 10% of European savings) . But for now no. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 03:39:09
Scaaaaaaam! 
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:00:27
1 day for me.. But give them exactly what they ask, otherwise it gets denied. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:34:40
1..2..3..4....9..10. 
Use the freaking search, it gets asked 10 times a day. 
Anyway, welcome! 
@_date: 2013-12-08 12:23:04
^ This.. U can Google: boot Linux from usb and install electrum on it (not via the Internet ofcourse ;) ) 
Edit: I also have the ninjastik, not expensive and great service (I have no interests in ninjastik) and it does the job too (first thing to do: disable Internet cnnection) 
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:28:01
I stopped trying, I noticed people were getting tired of it, so yeah
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:15:31
 Yes it works fine.. I did a transfer from Belgium and in 3 days my money was on bitstamp. Bought btc and it all went smooth. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:04:29
I had the same feeling when they were $100.. Seems so cheap now. 
Next year ppl will be all like: why didn't I buy @ 250 
Or remember the suckers who bought in @ 250 
I hope it's the first one. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:41:10
Use Amory or electrum wallet. So u can have cold storage and an online wallet at the same time.. Way safer. 
Bitcoinarmory.com / electrum.org
@_date: 2013-10-13 23:12:45
I think u are right.. SR take down was all over the media. 
Maybe something else could be helping the price increase: few days ago the IMF announced a plan to tax 10% of the savings of 15 European countries (like mine) to fill the hole in europe. This is not based on facts, it's just my idea
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:44:02
Hi, I'm from the past.. I can't believe u haven't spend all your dollars? They are less worth tomorrow ;) 
@_date: 2013-10-26 10:52:04
Haha :) 
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:13:51
Lol yeah, was he actually awake? 
@_date: 2013-10-13 21:20:56
That's right, they can't stop bitcoin! 
(well, I really hope they can't) 
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:47:20
Everything u named is what cash does.. And cash works just fine for the moment. Bitcoin just does it better in so many ways. So your arguments are useless imo. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:53:13
Yes it's true.. That's why bitcoin does everything that cash does.. Only with a lot of extra features/benefits. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:06:30
Nobody knows.. Last time I bought was during the Silk road period @ around 100 
For now I'm waiting for the price to drop a little.. Because I think there will be drop to about 150-160 
On the other hand, it may just go up further. If we knew what was gonna happen, we would all be filthy rich by now
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:18:01
Receiving is not a problem, the problem is sending. So I want to make an online send transaction onto a usb, (but then I get the error) then sign it with the offline computer. 
Yes I'm using 1.8.1
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:34:50
Yes, it happens all the time. 
1000 btc could be a fake wall and the owner removes it when it comes to close. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:06:18
Yes, it's been official since a few months
@_date: 2013-10-03 21:14:09
Price difference is only huge between mtgox and all the rest. I don't know the exact reason, but i keep reading it's because of the fact it's very hard to withdraw usd from gox. So a $ on gox is 'less' worth then others. 
Btc-e is Bulgaria I guess.. I don't like there deposit options, so can't give u info. I (Europe) use bitstamp because it's 0% deposit fee and only $ 0.9 to withdraw.. Bitstamp is based in the US I think. 
So actually don't sell btc for usd on gox.. There are stories about withdraws for over 2 months. 
I think Campbx and coinbase are good for Americans. 
For cashout I can only speak for bitstamp = 3 days. If u are from the EU, bitstamp is the best, given u have free SEPA deposit 
@_date: 2013-10-24 01:50:52
Sounds good. There is the difference, I'm in my 20's and just started a good job. So either way I will survive ;) a high bitcoin price would be a very nice extra 
@_date: 2013-12-27 13:18:37
Can't be cheaper right? For 2gig Internet and almost unlimited sms? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:10:20
Nobody knows what going to happen. But I just want to tell u, that I was thinking the same when btc were around 100usd. I'm glad I bought. But again it's possible that u buy now and it drops 50-100usd 
@_date: 2013-10-17 00:43:24
Same over here 502 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:25:38
No not possible.. Well it's possible for about 2 weeks and then the difficulty will adjust to the huge computing power. Correct me if I'm wrong 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:21:02
There is a service that allows u to buy anything with bitcoin, but i forgot the name. It has been posted here on reddit before 
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:03:53
I can only say that it work very well for me, but i live in Europe. So that doesn't really help I guess 
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:00:17
Yes it's possible. 
Use electrum or armory for cold storage 
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:15:47
Yes it's the least annoying exchange! 
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:49:33
Europe: Btc-e and bitstamp (sepa) 
USA: coinbase or campbx
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:51:17
Ok here is what u do: u need 2 laptop/desktop. 1 can be your everyday computer which has Internet connection and u need 1 offline pc that NEVER touches the Internet. 
U download electrum from electrum.org onto a usb stick with your online computer and u install it on the offline pc and do the following :
[Offline PC] Install Electrum via a USB-Key.
[Offline PC] Create a new wallet. Write down the seed and memorize it, after which you should probably destroy the seed or keep it safe in a lockbox.
[Offline PC] Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export and copy your "Master Public Key" and put it in a text file on your USB-Key.
[Online PC] Install Electrum and select Restore in the dialog box shown on the first start up, use the "Master Public Key".
[Online PC, existing Electrum installation] See below how to make Electrum to restore or open alternative, non-default, wallet.
If u do this, your bitcoins are safe, but u can still make transactions with the online wallet: more info on this: 
Any questions? Just ask
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:57:35
Lulz, indeed.. Porn is free ;-) 
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:27:38
Yes, that's what I do too. I have some early coins in cold storage and I use and rebuy small amounts for daily uses. (Internet service like Vpn and recently food deliveries) 
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:25:30
No comment.. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:49:08
Yeah ok. It's not like you sold your house, still I would not have done that. The 5k is not so bad, but this 5k is like 100% of your 'savings' (actually worse, because it's a loan). But I get what u mean. 5k is not that much if u have a decent job. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:38:17
This is so true.. It feel that some ppl think it's a guaranteed profit. Dude, I have 10-20% of my savings in bitcoin (which I can afford to lose) and it makes me nervous from time to time. 
But yeah: no balls, no glory.. I guess -_-
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:40:31
Yes I have the private key and yes it has a password 
@_date: 2013-10-03 21:38:48
Have u been on Mars these days? :) jk
Yes it's because of silk road take down. But it recovered much faster then I thought 
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:05:42
Btc-e and bitstamp (for me) using sepa, the deposit is free,  withdraw (bitstamp) €0.9 fixed fee
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:12:16
I think u will.. I payed last Saturday. I don't know about u? 
@_date: 2013-10-24 00:48:27
Ok let's dream for a second.. I have some btc and some Alt coins. Today it's not enough for financial independence, but @ 10k/btc it will. I would probably travel the world. Always been a dream, but something annoying called work keeps me from doing that. I'm not materialistic at all, so that would be it for now. 
More likely, support my (future) family and (future) kids and make sure they have a good life. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:23:29
Stupid autocorrect.. Should be multipool.in
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:44:00
When it's to good to be true.. ;-) 
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:09:23
Free I don't know, but there are some cheap ones. I like to work with u on this. Keep me posted. Grtz
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:16:44
For a new coin to survive, it has to be revolutionary. Some alts have nice features already, still they don't get much attention and are being used for pump and dump. 
But I would love to see a new fresh SHA 256 coin! 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:16:13
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:18:46
No, because u can create many different addresses. 
Look at it (kinda) like an email. I can just make a new one and send something to u and u will know my email address, but not my identity. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 21:37:44
Bitstamp also has an EU bank in Slovenia or somewhere around there. For me it was 0% fee
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:49:37
It can be done.. And at least all he money will get there.. BUT who are u gonna trust with your bitcoins? People can say all kinds of stuff to 'raise' bitcoin. If it is official an any kind of way, it could work 
@_date: 2013-11-15 08:43:51
Secondmarket bitcoin funds? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:46:35
2 options: unlikely it reaches 100k,but if it does, nothing crazy and just live relaxed somewhere good. 
More likely option: (bitcoin fails to gain widespread adoption) I'll just cry and keep on dreaming what could have been. 
But seriously, I do have some btc, but I'm looking day after day for the next good investment. But that being said: for now btc has been the most profitable. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:09:33
Yes I agree, once we get away from this new 'all time high' point, ppl get confident and btc can continue it's rise.. But not as fast as this last month's rate. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:33:41
^ this! 
Also don't invest in something u don't fully understand. It took me many hours to fully get the concept + trading + make a 100% secure storage medium.

From the many Vpn services only a few are the real deal. 
Real deal for me: NO LOGS what so ever. No ip log, no logging how long your session is, etc. So there is no identifying the costumer. Not even via the payment (bitcoin) 
If they say something like:
* no illegal purposes, they log
* no logging unless court order.. 
* any reason what u can't do: they log. 
I like the price and features of PIA, but why oh why are the USA based!? 
I will never trust an USA based company when it comes to privacy/security. 
I use BTGuard.. Canada based, signed up with mailinator email and payed in bitcoin. They say they don't log and in case of court order, they have to hand over an empty harddrive, with nothing but the OS software. 
I hope they mean what they say.

Last crash due to Silk road take down. 
April crash: Cyprus and/or ddos attack on mtgox. 
So I do think it has a reason every time.

I can relate.. I wish I bought at ten, but I didn't know about bitcoin back then. I bought just below 100 and I went true the same proces of telling people and eventually (now) just shutting up about it, for exactly the same reasons.

Best advice is: don't buy mining equipment. Just buy bitcoins

If u don't want asic able to mine, then don't make a SHA coin.. Look for scrypt or fork primecoin (only cpu for the moment)

Yeah me too

No.. Coinbase is actually not an exchange.. Bitstamp and Btc-e verification took only 1 day and then u can sell/buy as many as u want instantly

Cgminer is the software that allows mining hardware to connect with the bitcoin network and search for blocks and mine bitcoin. 
Maybe technically not accurate, but that's what it does in a few words

A wallet in general is a piece of software where u store your bitcoins. 
If u choose to store them on your hard drive (software like bitcoin qt, electrum, armory), u are responsible for keeping them safe. 
U have a wallet.dat (like c:/.. /bitcoin-qt/.../wallet.dat) file which contains all the information (sending/receiving) about your wallet/bitcoinaddress(es). 
On a 'website wallet' they store them for u, but imo there is more risk if someone hacks the website. 
With your own wallet on your hard drive, u can make an offline wallet, so that your bitcoins are safe. 
This is basically the difference. 
Just read a lot about keeping your bitcoins safe. I recommend using electrum or armory wallet. They have a function where your wallet is offline, but u can still spend them via an 2nd online computer. This is far out the safest option.

U have to have a little knowledge for it, but u can run Linux from a usb stick.  
Look here:  
Ofcourse don't connect to the Internet ;) 
But if u want a 'real' offline laptop, just buy an old used one for 100 usd from eBay and put Linux on it.

Bitstamp.net or btc-e.com

It's one or the other.. Imo bitcoin was designed to keep control out of the hands of the govs. 
But that's just 1 thing bitcoin has to offer. The possibilities are 'endless'.. We're just not their yet
