My guess is it'll initially be a combination of ProTip with a bulk send kind of settlement. Not sure though.

We're constantly upgrading the system so we definitely consider ourselves in beta. However, the platform is open to all publishers and anyone can view videos. Come on in, the water's warm!

Top notch cast. Very high quality. Sure to provoke a lot of thought and discussion.

The amount of time you save by not loading/watching ads is tremendous. Literally years of your life. Also, on mobile particularly, the data savings (cost) is tremendous.
 
But, content creators still need a way to sustain making the stuff you love. So paying them directly through bitcoin is a miracle. Win-win!

Good to know. Thanks!

FYI, [PopChest]( will be filming Andreas' three stop tour in Silicon Valley and San Francisco later this month. If you want early access to these videos, behind the scenes footage, and an opportunity to support a favorite Andreas charity, then [join our beta]( for updates. Thanks!

LOL! We're scheduled to take new ones tomorrow morning.

Quick question about Mycelium Gear: How does Gear deal with wallet gap issues? i.e. On a HD chain of addresses, address  gets paid then address  gets paid but since standard wallets don't look ahead that far then the client doesn't know about the 2nd payment. Thanks!

[PopChest.com]( our bitcoin pay-per-view service is built on top of Coinbase. Check it out and let's chat about how we can make your videos available to stream/download.
 
Ditto on tax advice. Definitely consult your local professional.

Once there is enough content, we'll turn the page into a portal to discover all the video makers using our bitcoin micropayment system.   Everyone is welcome!
