I think if you were to put in bitcoin into a wallet on the site and it would just pull out funds for how much you watch, you wouldn’t really think about whether or not you wanted to pay to watch a particular video, it would just deduct from that wallet for how many seconds you viewed. If the amount was small enough where I didn’t even think about the cost and the content was good, why not?

Also, if I wanted to monetize videos on YouTube, currently would have to fulfill certain criteria before I could do that.

Couldn't you exchange it for an altcoin and convert it back to Bitcoin? That would make sure your new coins won't be tracked back to coinbase through the blockchain.

When the ad example popped up, I instinctively clicked the X and ended up pausing the video. I was confused there for a second.
