Its all crypto. No such thing as alts anymore. I suggest you guys diversify instead of hating.
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:02:57
Thanks for sharing. I, for one, will never use BTC-e again.
@_date: 2018-08-24 06:30:11
Most altcoins are useless. But, there are altcoins that transfer value faster, cheaper or even free. people don’t buy Btc for that, though.

Denial is one hell of a drug 
@_date: 2018-08-24 06:36:04
A lot of them are gone and the believers remain. Fomo will get the weak hands back in 
@_date: 2018-08-23 13:47:15
Bitcoin is still old tech that’s bad for the environment. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:42:38
Boycott Apple
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:22:21
And everyone is soon to be connected on mobile phones, regardless of where they are. Bitcoin is definitely a game changer.
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:03:43
They are all getting mobile phones. It's only a matter of time.
@_date: 2018-10-02 02:53:12
Someone bought at the peak! 
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:01:30
I'm trying. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 01:56:17
Why are you so upset?
@_date: 2018-10-24 07:26:02
Where we going?
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:46:12
Why isn’t this getting attention?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:04:19
Buy Litecoin. It's faster than bitcoin and accepted everywhere bitcoin is. It's way undervalued. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:05:29
"real" money is constantly printed out of thin air. btc is at least backed by a public ledger called the block chain. 
@_date: 2019-04-19 22:06:24
haha. and i know that the actual circulating supply will be much less given how many are lost, etc.
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:50:07
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:10:53
Yes. NANO is the slick smart phone.
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:34:58
people on reddit love overreacting about that
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:49:16
great perspective
@_date: 2015-09-25 17:51:18
Couldn't this company have found someone else? I am not sure how having someone with minimal knowledge of BTC is a good look?
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:08:13
But why would people still have incentive to help power the block chain? 
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:16:49
So glad I bought Btc during the bear market. Everyone I knew thought I was crazy.
@_date: 2019-05-21 04:18:27
It does, but at least Bitcoin help them hold value.
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:08:51
This subreddit is so toxic. Even though I agree that BTC isn't a viable currency, it is a store of wealth like digital gold and has high brand awareness worldwide. It isn't going anywhere. Welcome aboard!
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:46:29
There are already many processors that instantly convert BTC into fiat. Pull your head out of the sand. There's no risk for businesses to accept BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:14:13
Oh, I don't own shitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:43:05
You're fucking retarded.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:46:01
No one else has this issue?
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:37:10
Where did you read that? This is quite frustrating but I don't hear much of an uproar in the community. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:15:37
I'm mostly in LTC. And I agree with you there. Best of luck :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:04:54
I'll be sure to close my Chase account at the earliest!
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:40:21
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:15:46
Because it is super volatile and risky? People who run businesses have enough risk. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 02:36:23
Come on! Answer me, guys!
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:42:26
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:37:46
Yes. I work in an Indian company and my colleagues love the idea and were all asking me to buy for them. Any news on an Indian exchange coming up?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:25:01
That's a good question. My friend said the BTC conference will be in Bangalore next. That's good.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:05:45
It's pre mined, ok. But any other reasons? Come on. If you're going to throw around such heavy accusations you should provide some sources and facts. Otherwise just stfu.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:30:58
Except the fact that I've already tripled my money in Quark. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:19:08
How is Quarkcoin a scam? It is more secure than Bitcoin. Sounds like you're all just full of shit!
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:20:41
How do you figure QRK is a scam? How about you provide some facts to back up your loaded claims! 
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:42:16
What's this mean for the price of BTC guys? Guys? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:24:10
Haven't dragged anyone into anything. I've turned .3 btc into 1.3 and will most likely sell. How do you feel about other altcoins? Litecoin?
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:24:52
Really? Wow, then there really is no reason not to accept it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:20:34
Oh, cool.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:09:49
What is shitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:53:48
For someone who hates BTC so much you sure do spend a lot of time in the subreddit. Get a life, fiat sheep.
