It does make a valid point about the need for the currency to be stable to be used effectively as a medium of exchange.
It’s pretty clear that what’s needed is a cheap crypto who’s mining incentives lie solely in processing transactions and who’s supply is constant enough to discourage hoarding and speculation/investment, thereby maintaining a stable value.

Everyone harps on about the privacy issue and how it enables terrorists and criminals.
But the financial world has been shifting us away from cash to credit cards and points systems.

Pretty much - the money essentially went straight into ledgers  of big banks to balance the losses, and didn't really enter the system in the traditional sense. That's why we've not really seen hyperinflation. We're certainly in uncharted territory though because no one really knows what the end result of all this quantitative easing will be.

The big issue with inflation as with a lot of Economy data is it is not a complete picture.
Inflation doesn’t take into account the biggest cost to families - the cost of housing.
If you factor that in then the true inflation figure is much higher.
Yes it’s an asset - but we saw how that worked out during the GFC which is obviously when the idea of bitcoin was born.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:19:37
Well Bitcoin has been like a gateway drug (bad term) for people to enter the space. for example I got interested in crypto because of bitcoin and what it stood for.
But as I educated myself I realised while it will continue to have a place. (As a store of value)
There are other cryptos with so much potential - Ethereum and Iota as a start.
Just look at this Sub and have a look at all the stupid posts about how much money we’re going to make and how we’re all going to the moon.
And whilst I wouldn’t begrudge people a chance to make $ - that was not Satoshi’s vision.
People who do not understand the fundamentals of why this technology is so important and even what it means . People who have simply seen it as a get rich quick scheme will soon lose faith and exit when they see Bitcoin stagnate around 17500 (which is what’s happening now).
But that’s good - because once the deck has been cleared of all the hangers on that has clogged up the system - there will be room to develop, innovate and grow again.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:01:03
They don’t get rid of inflation they just provide a store of value that outpaces inflation - so your money doesn’t deflate in value. Or at least that’s how I understand it.

Horses for courses - some alt coins are addressing some very specific needs that bitcoin is incapable of doing.
I think if you’re in this space and your loaded up on bitcoin only - then your missing the potential of the whole crypto revolution.
Some alt coins will fade - but there’s 3 or 4 in there that are shaping up to be dominate players with the potential to even surpass bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:28:29

Bitcoin as an actual payment system for goods is kind of dead due to its Price volatility (why buy a camera today when tmrw it will be 25% cheaper and why run the risk of pricing anything in bitcoin, when every 10min you need to revaluate).

Let’s be honest Proof of Work is showing issues (concentration of miners in China etc) My understanding of IOTA Tangle is that it overcomes the need of POW with randomness. If you randomly select two nodes across the entire network to confirm a transaction it’s unlikely that those two nodes will both be in collusion/malicious.
Of course for this to be effective it needs to be a large network with lots of nodes to increase the pool for random selection.
I’m figuring you’d also need to get the malware on lots of individual devices as well.

It’s simply an agreement to buy or sell bitcoin at a future price. 
So say I agree to buy 100 bitcoin from you with a settlement date of January 01 2018.
We agree a price of $16000 per bitcoin.
If come Jan 01 bitcoin is actually trading at $18000 then I’ve done well, because our futures contract let’s me buy your bitcoin for 16000.
But if the price has dropped (say 10,000) you have done well.
Traditionally futures are used in international trade to hedge against currency fluctuations.
Think if I’m Australian buying 20 Boeing aircraft with a delivery date in the future I want buy some US dollar futures to ensure I don’t get stung with a rise in US dollar exchange rates making those Boeing’s all the more expensive.
Because no real commerce is transacted with bitcoin the whole concept of bitcoin futures is a little stupid and premature at this point .
Basically it’s gambling.
As a result what I suspect you’ll see is entities buying up bitcoin hiking the price with the aim to dump it later (reduce the price) and cash in on their futures contracts.

Pretty sure money flows towards gold - if not it will this time as interest rates will be so low.
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:33:19
The value you receive from one side of the transaction (owning bitcoin) deducts from the other (value of the currency as supply is increased ).
Value (with regards to purely financial deals - buying currency etc) is kind of like energy in the universe it can really only ever just change from one form to another with a slight loss in the process  in the form of heat (or processing fees in bitcoins case).
@_date: 2019-03-16 21:39:29
Cash isn’t meant to be a store of value - it’s role is actually best served as a deflationary mechanism to ensure wealth and capital is invested in things such as business.
It’s part of the reason so many crypto projects are hindered by people Hodling their coins - when really they should be fluid and spent.
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:13:39

I hate to be a party pooper but wasn't bitcoins value in being a frictionless form of exchange for goods and services on the internet.
Now you can't buy shit with it because its too volatile for traders to price into a product. 
And commissions for its conversion to FIAT are destroying it as form of remittance. So in the end what good is it in its present form? A store of value?
At least with gold you can make high end electronics.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:15:27
