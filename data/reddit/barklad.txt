The rise was from Bitcoin being undervalued due to lack of exposure. Now that the populace know about the benefits the genie can't get put back into the bottle. Volatility is one thing but a quick and sudden death of Bitcoin is a fairy tale. One of the only ways I see Bitcoin going down to $1000 ever again is if Coinbase randomly decides one day to steal all of their clients Bitcoins, and even then Bitcoin would bounce back. A lot of the new people in the community weren't around for the fall of Mt. Gox, back then everyone thought Bitcoin was done but here we are today. It's hard to stop a runaway train that reduces monetary friction in all aspects of life.

In trading it's called floor support. Internationally there is equipment worth millions that can only mine Bitcoin or BCH, the equipment costs prohibit those who mine and own the equipment from selling beyond a certain threshold. This provides a base level of support for the BTC economy as well as it provides incentives for traders to purchase cheap coins around this floor level. This doesn't even include the massive black market economy that uses BTC and have large holdings that they can't move quickly enough to dump on the market, thus also providing a floor. Lastly BTC being inherently deflationary in nature, it would take a catastrophic event for BTC to be suppressed below $3k/BTC for an extended period of time at our current market cap.

Not indefinitely, but miner's spread a LOT of FUD out of their own pockets to protect their best interests, it is astounding the influence they have when they work together; look up ASICBOOST. I'm also not saying it's impossible to go to zero or for there to ever be a temporary crash. What I am saying is that Bitcoin is not stocks, it can be moved around far easier and cheaply thus there is a market minimum priced in with a 95% certainly depending on how high the market cap currently is.

LOL. This guy, comedy gold. The days of $3k/BTC are long gone my friend.

How would that collapse occur? Give me a scenario where people with millions of dollars worth of hardware assets wouldn't do everything in their power to keep the system afloat. Just look at BCH, for all intents and purposes it should be worth around $200/BCH but it's not because Roger Ver and Jihan alone sustain the price above $1000 with how much mining equipment they have. At times Ver has mined at a loss to maintain BCH at a certain value. It does happen and it is happening. Also you didn't comment on the black market at all. Do you honestly think you can dump $30 million+ in BTC at the drop of a hat or even in a month? The thing you're forgetting is that in order to sell you have to have a buyer if demand dries up then you're stuck with Bitcoin at that price at which point deflationary pressure kicks in again driving the price up as more coins are mined.

You are conflating terms. The banking industry is not a Pyramid Scheme, that is a specific term with a specific definition.

The problem is that constitutionally it is supposed to be properly documented. You can't spend 50x more than your budget, make off-book adjustments, and then just claim "We totally bought stuff, let me check the garage. I'll put it on eBay tomorrow."

Lol, not really in the argument but this is an hilariously awful concept. If I get jumped in the street for my wallet it's an attack, differing opinions on who should own my money but an attack nonetheless.

These things aren't mutually exclusive. I'm in it for the tech but was I ecstatic when we hit $20k? Absolutely. You're right though, believing in the tech doesn't mean you have to buy/hold as much as you can, however I'd also say that the people who will sell everything and shit-talk crypto now will be looked at as hypocrites when they pretend like it didn't happen in 6 months - 1 year when a recovery occurs. 
Stick to your guns, if you think crypto is a failed experiment that's cool go back to buying gold and trading stocks. But let's not pretend that most of this sub nowadays aren't fairweather "investers". The positives of the crash are that the weak hands will hopefully permanently leave the scene and we can go back to talking about (and building) the tech.

You're forgetting us OG Bitcoiners who were never in it just for the money. We invest because we believe in the technology. All this has happened before (2013) and will happen again. People are going to punch themselves in the face for not buying this low if they ever believed in the technology itself.

Alright, let's assume you didn't have this overly canned and pompous speech ready on your laptop for months. 
Let's assume you just have a flair for the theatric without actually presenting a coherent and concise case. 
Let's also assume you didn't copy pasta these talking points to spread FUD. 
Then I'd say you're in the wrong place my man. You make a lot of points, some valid, some not so valid, but you weren't looking to communicate you were ( and are ) looking to spread your version of discord. You like to type, clearly, so use that ability to type up your solutions, because the technology is open source so if your massive brain solved ALL the problems you outlined then coding an alt coin would be the easiest part. You'd be a hero on the internet and beyond, lauded everywhere you go because that is clearly what you're looking for.
I'm really not being too fascetious when I say, If you've actually produced new knowledge that no one in the community has worked out yet then come help the community thrive instead of throwing shade. (A little screen name pun for ya) It's easy to point out flaws and wait around for other people to fix things (Lightning Network anyone?) but a real intellect isn't about scoring useless Reddit points, it's about helping others find solutions.

I love that in the Bitcoin sub we still get guys that know nothing about Bitcoin and spread ridiculous metaphorical FUD about how the value is pure speculation. SMH. I miss the early years where we talked about the quality of the tech bringing inherent value.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:02:38
I hear you. A lot of us are in tech related industries so it is surprising that more ideas about how to push bitcoin forward aren't being discussed versus what price it current sits at. I think even simple showing of pride in bitcoin like wearing a patch or displaying a sticker can get the conversation going among the average person. We need to get the message out in a unique way that isn't about the corresponding USD value.

After all the craziness I thought we needed a laugh to bring us back to our roots.

Hey let's actually be constructive. I'm sure all the developers are busting their ass right now. Take a breath and let's get some relevant questions answered.

BOA took about 3-4 hours for me.

That's a great point that I hadn't thought of. I wonder how many merchants are having problems with BitPay processing?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:07:00
Personally I think everyone is freaking out and this is a needed step so that we don't see a panic selloff down below $50.

Can Incubus be the spokes-band of Bitcoin? Pretty please? With streamed reddit concerts supported by bit-tips...now there's an idea
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:13:33
Yes, but there are quite a few engineers who are taking payments who need to cash out to fiat in order to get parts for mining rigs. Not to mention covering their shipping charges, etc.

I'm in that same hipster part of Brooklyn and we're out there spreading the good word, but it's hard getting people on board locally because they don't see the benefit over cash in fostering community relationships.

Watch the [video]( of the supposed DPR (Ross) and his friend René.  You would expect that whoever started SR to be a very smart and talented person. René gives me that vibe moreso than Ross, and them being both roommates in SF makes me think that they both were DPR. I just don't see Ross (based on this video) masterminding the entire enterprise.
