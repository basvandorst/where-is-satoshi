she talks about that bitcoin people don't want to hear another opinion other than that it will moon
She is right but the problem is basically the whole internet, people look for like minded others. But especially social media tools are designed for this, since people buy more when they are reinforced with like minded communities. They lock you in. I also especially see this in the crypto world with the many coins existing. And especially on reddit.
I hope that ultimately we get to another level of connectivity with cryptocurrencies, that will benefit a more open communication between the various communities, rather than trying to lock them into mindsets.

i don't want to sound harsh and am very sorry for your loss but when he really killed himself only because he did not made enough money on bitcoins, he was into bitcoin for the wrong reasons in the first place imo.
yes we all like to make money, and i could also have invested in 2012 and i bite my ass for not doing it, i saw bitcoin i had the money at the time it just didnt "clicked" for me, however i believe in bitcoin and thus i still believe in getting rich, i always will think that when the price will go up but i would never kill myself because the price would go up, that just sounds so wrong to me.

does he has a different haircut?

Am so with you bro, Vitalik seems first a brilliant mind, but i sense something evil, not that he is evil, but his thinking can be evil since he is an optimisation guy and will do what has less friction, because that is deemed to be most successful, so he will go the banker route and do all they want, as long as he can say that there is still math involved at least, math is not running it but regulating it, however when math just regulates it, who is leading it?

i think you are right man, saw a presentation from Vitalik yesterday and he heavily talked about having trust in a third party and that it can be all mixed up with algorithmic, so yeah i think ETH is going to be the first gov.COIN
