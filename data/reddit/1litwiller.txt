Transfer to gdax for no fee, then they cover the transaction fees when you move it out of gdax. Costs you nothing.

Satoshi could easily have been a team of programmers contracted by an agency like the nsa to develop bitcoin. The private keys could be held by a government, central bank, agency, or a Rothschild, for all we know...

We live in a country that is supposed to operate on checks and balances. The president is not a king. If the president were permitted to run the fed as he wished, we would have hyperinflation, as each would shovel money at their friends and voters to fuel their reelection. The politicians have created so much unfunded debt through tax cuts and entitlements and bailouts; and the fed attempts to keep inflation in check and keep the economy from burning up or crashing out. Essentially, they have continued quantitative easing and reduced interest rates. Everyone got upset about 1 rate hike and now they are saying they will make future adjustments towards ending qe instead of rate hikes. So since they haven’t really been reporting the recent numbers on qe, no one outside the fed will know what they are doing, but Wall Street will be happy not to hear about any rate hikes. 
Every dollar a politician spends is debt.
The beauty of bitcoin is it’s not debt.

He doesn’t have authority to fire the fed chairman.
He just wants to blame his economy on someone else.

I don’t think the revolution is gonna happen the way you do, but one is coming. I like to imagine the day when my crypto holdings continue to gain value while all my debts are held in inflating fiat.

Buy at Coinbase and they will choose an arbitrary date 5-10 days in the future to deliver it to your Coinbase wallet.
It doesn’t sound like you should try anything more advanced than that at the moment.

Seems like the big money, like banks and such, are trying to depress the market while they buy in. So, once the Rothschilds and Rockefellers feel like they have captured the crypto space, I expect they will let it bounce back the way they want it to.
Blessed are the oligarchs for they will inherit the Earth.

Facebook and other social media companies allow the government to accomplish goals it can’t on its own. The nsa and cia are supposed to collect data on external threats and the fbi is supposed to follow internal threats. By privatizing the data collection they can avoid any questions of improper search or overreaching their directives. It also allows for the private data companies to collaborate on the development of the ultimate A I by the competition/collaboration of Facebook/Amazon/Google/Apple, passing the Turing test and eventually being incorporated into all US made spaceships, war machines, etc.; leading to the continued subjugation of the rest of the citizens of Earth by the dominant super powers that were able to fund this type of research- US/Russia/China... or more appropriately the oligarchs and corporations that own and operate those governments.
I feel that the relatively favorable treatment that bitcoin has received from the US government that it was likely the result of a government funded project and that a government agency or the FED hold the private keys to the 1 million BTC in satoshi’s wallet. This would essentially be a digital Ft. Knox.
Alright, I gotta go back to sleep.

Neither. Finance it in fiat at any promo rate below 2%. Fed targets 2% inflation, so the money you spend on payments will be lesser value than the loan...
