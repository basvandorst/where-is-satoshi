Thank you! I can't way to use it!

You are right but I think that it's very important that you can spend bitcoin like you do with cash. I think that it is very dificult for those people to understand the benefits of bitcoin if they can't use them in their local grocery.

So if you want to hack a Trezor you need the pin and visual access to the Trezor. If you want to hack a Ledger Wallet you need the pin and physical access to the security card. Is that correct? So you can't acces the Ledger Wallet if the security card isn't close?

So according to you they are equally safe? They just use other methods to secure your bitcoins?

You think those 2 reasons are worth spending more money for the Trezor?

I just ordered a Trezor. You have all been very helpful! So thank you all!

If you think about spending you're time just to get your money in your hands, it's just absurd. What if you get stuck in traffic? I really wouldn't want to drive 10-15 minutes and 10-15 minutes back to get my money out of that machine.. That's almost half an hour you're on your way.. I wouldn't be happy either

Links to other discusions are also welcome!

That's actually the problem

Can you do a M-of-N scheme with Trezor?
@_date: 2014-12-14 22:46:03
That's right! Glad I bought a Trezor! Thank you for all the information!

 Everything has to start somewhere. I wonder when some websites will offer a discount if you pay with Bitcoin. And when they do, there will be a lot more people interested to buy things online with Bitcoin. I consider the zero to none transaction fees as a very huge advantage for online shops. I'm convinced that this will attract more customers so they sell more products. The result will be a profit that is greater then the money that is "lost" in giving the discount. At least, that's my view.

I don't like paper wallets. Should you use 2 Trezors then? One in a safe box and one for spending bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:21:11
That is actually a really good idea! Thanks! @_date: 2014-12-13 22:43:59
Bitcoin has benefits for all ages. And I actually think my grandma will more easily understand how she can use bitcoin then using the digital tv to record something. She keeps forgetting what buttons to press

Interesting. But I can't wait for more then six months. I wonder how that all is going to work

For small volumes I use Uphold (SEPA transfer). No fee for verified members but limit on volume.
 for more info on the fees.

I just downloaded your app.
Here is what I would like:
- the ability to make a selection of which cards to show. Now I have a lot of empty cards.
- a nice overview of the cards, like Bitreserve does. I have a lot of them and swiping multiple times to find the correct one isn't user friendly
- the ability to specify from which card(s) the bitcoins have to come from when you pay something. Same thing for receiving Bitcoin.
I didn't find any major bugs. Great work!
Some more Bitreserve functionalities would be very welcome!
