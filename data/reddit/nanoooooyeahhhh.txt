I think it was a bit of reverse psychology more than anything. He knows if he says that the mods won't actually delete it because they think "hurr let's prove him wrong". But the idea was actually to promote his platform with that statement to ensure the video DOESN'T get deleted. In other words, the mods got outsmarted and outplayed. It's a win win for Roger and a lose lose for rBitcoin. If it stays, Roger gets to promote his platform. If it goes, he gets to say he was right. He's smarter than people give him credit for. For the record, I'm not a BCash supporter, and I'm not even subscribed to their subreddit, but I'm unbiased and can say things objectively. I know I'll get downvoted for this, but you're just confirming the lack of rationality in here by doing so.
Btw, speaking of bias, the title of your thread is hilarious. It was established in the first few minutes of the video that Jimmy Song, prior to the debate, wouldn't inform Roger Ver of the format of it or what it was surrounding, so of course he was going to show up unprepared. You can't prepare for something if you don't know what it is you're preparing for. Speaking objectively, it's possible that this wasn't true and Roger was lying, however Jimmy Song didn't reject the claim, so I'm led to believe it's true.
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:33:52
Considering that Jimmy proposed to him the format on the stage, I find this unlikely. If he knew what the format was already, why would he need to ask Roger if he's okay with it? Also the claim that Jimmy withheld this information from him is pretty damning, so again, why would he not refute it?

Not trolling at all, you're incredibly ignorant of the eco-system, Bitcoin and its actors. You think that because a 51% attack hasn't occurred it's proof that the incentives are balanced. Such incredibly stupid logic. They're going to appear balanced until they aren't, that's the point. Centralization is a BAD THING, you should know that already. If the system is designed in a way that power accumulates into a small group of individuals in a small area then obviously the incentives are not balanced, regardless of the frequency of a 51% attack.
And are you failing to remember the drama and divide that Bitmain has caused within the Bitcoin community? Do you think they'd have that level of power and control if they weren't such an influence? Do you think they would be in that position if the system wasn't so imbalanced? Use your brain please, you're the troll.
And for the record, the devs have spoken about changing the mining algorithm plenty of times simply for these reasons, so obviously they recognize it as a threat and a bad thing. If the devs can acknowledge this as fact then you're either ignorant or purposefully deceiving people. Maybe you're just trying to convince yourself desperately because the truth is upsetting to you? Which one is it? This is what separates a good investor from a bad one, the ability to look at things objectively, regardless of personal stake. You obviously fail at that.

He already owns most of the BCH in circulation, and the mining power of it, so of course switching BCH to PoS would be desirable for him. He can then control BCH with his supply, and Bitcoin with his mining, without having to split resources. In saying that, this isn't a problem for projects that start with PoS to begin with and have better early distribution methods -- it's only a problem when a single or small group of actors control the majority of tokens (like they would in the case of BCH). A lot of shills will claim that his words are proof that "PoS is bad", but that's nonsense. Context is everything.

You've got it entirely backwards, mining = senate consensus. DPoS = distributed consensus, when utilized properly. The entire point is to delegate a fair distribution, unlike the distribution that occurs naturally in Bitcoin because electricity is cheaper in China and they have no patent law.


Yes, they do. Bitcoin is now permanently (as long as Bitmain exists) vulnerable to a 51% attack, double spending and halting of transactions. They can literally print money out of thin air by sending fake coins to exchanges.

Mining breaks Nash equilibrium, so he's 100&amp; right. DPoS is the solution. PoS on its own is not sufficient, we need the ability to assign delegates. The problem is that Bitcoin will never switch it's consensus algorithm due to political pressure from miners. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:43:32


I don't think that's actually a problem. It's already been declared Bitcoin isn't a security, and you don't see the feds trying to arrest or assassinate Vitalik or any of the other cryptocurrency creators. The real problem with him spending funds is that it would devalue Bitcoin for a couple of reasons:
1. People would take it as evidence that Satoshi no longer believes in Bitcoin.
2. Having that much of that distribution in the hands of a single person is all-round bad.
Assumptions are made by people that he is dead because the coins haven't been touched, but that is not evidence of that. He may very well have a giant stash of Bitcoin we are unaware of. Considering that he was there in the inception of Bitcoin, I think it's safe to assume he did a lot more mining than we know of. He has no reason to touch the coins under the public eye because he can sell coins that aren't.

@_date: 2018-06-26 00:44:11


That's only half of the story. Sure, in Bitcoin nodes validate transactions, but transactions get no where without miners. So really, miners validate transactions. You can think of DPoS as electing miners, as the closest comparison. When you consider that mining has a natural tendency for centralization, this is nothing but a good thing.


Half truth. You can validate your own transactions if you are your own representative. Not hard to do.


One layer of validation. Not anyone can include transactions in a block, only miners have that power. As a result, they also have the power to game the system by withholding transactions, censoring transactions and double spending. So yes, game theory does enter the picture here. The official representatives in Bitcoin can be thought of as the miners. It's the closest parallel. 


You're missing the point. I wouldn't steal a car either. The point is to protect the network against those with a lack of conscience, that is the purpose of security in general. You can't claim Bitcoin is "decentralized and secure" when mining is already under majority control by a single entity.

It doesn't need one, I'm sure you know what all of those words mean.


It's not a contradiction, you're assuming that those things are inclusive. They are not. Some miners may wish to censor transactions for whatever reason (political or otherwise), some miners may wish to manipulate the transaction fees by only processing transactions above a certain fee, or flood the mempool with lower cost transactions that never get mined because they have majority network hashing.


It's already happened before, for different motives. Again, not inclusive.
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:34:55


OP isn't misunderstanding, you are. The point is that people need to hold reserves or they will run out of funds to support the channel. An exchange is a perfect example. As a result, those reserves are effectively burned, but they aren't used (unless throughput picks up, and that is what they're there for). So no, it's not FUD, it's a justified complaint.
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:10:06
Silly title, \*obviously\* it's not a blessing. Let's do away with mining all together. It's a relic of the past, and is not necessary to move forward. Vitalik has the right idea (as well as a large chunk of altcoins).
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:24:28


It's embarrassingly easy to accidentally lose your funds by closing your channel prematurely with a stale state. Banks may be able to censor transactions, but in LN you can easily lose your money. Banks also offer insurance, and are subject to audits, \*extremely\* strict compliance measures, and government intervention. They can't just "steal" your money and get away with it, there is always legal recourse, and there is always a paper trail. I trust banks far more than I trust crypto exchanges. Never heard a single story of a bank stealing someones funds, but I've heard countless stories of exchange employees going rogue. No surprise, considering exchanges are mostly unregulated.
As for your censorship comment, miners already have the ability to censor transactions right now in Bitcoin because of mining centralization (&gt;51&amp; hashing is owned by a single entity).


No, Bitcoin is "fully anonymous", Lightning Network just routes Bitcoin. I wouldn't even call it fully anonymous though, there are plenty of trails to be left behind including blockchain auditing, balance matching, exchange auditing and reporting, and banking records. Bitcoin is semi-pseudonymous, but not fully, unless you're using mixing services and the like (but I'm referring to the protocol itself).

That's definitely the best angle to pitch this. Example: "I'm an institutional investor, and I've been forced to buy Bitcoin through cryptocurrency exchanges. This exposes our organization to a lot of risk due to the frequency of hacks, theft, and lack of regulation on these platforms. An ETF would be an extremely useful tool for investors like us, who are interested in minimizing their risk exposure whilst investing in cryptocurrency."
@_date: 2018-07-18 07:47:41
He dodged the question related to mining supply so hard. I agree, less miners should not impact the price, as he said, you still only get a limited number of coins mined per interval. That doesn't change.
@_date: 2018-07-06 01:24:18
Good question. You can make assumptions by address ownership, obviously not bullet-proof because people can have multiple addresses, however the majority of people use a small number of addresses (or a single address) for the convenience factor, so we can see within a small margin of error at minimum. 
Markets also have a tendency to distribute themselves over time as well, because eventually the person holding all of the coins wants to spend them. If you're not realizing gains then you're not making profits. 
I also don't think ETH is a particularly good example of how it should be done. There is another project out there (not going to say it's name because I don't want to accused of advertising) that used a protected faucet for distribution, and by observing the network we can see far reaching distribution -- and what was particularly nice is that it reached a lot of third-world poverty stricken locations, something that generally wouldn't happen in an ICO.
Now, don't get me wrong, there's always going to be a hierarchy of ownership in any crypto project (the dollar included). Bitcoin is particularly bad for this (and I'll let you draw your own conclusions why), to quote someone who crunched the numbers:


And lastly, it's worth noting that in a proof of stake system, someone with a large stake has an incentive to protect the network, not attack it, lest they lose their large investment. It makes little sense attempting to double-spend for a million dollars when you'd be sacrificing a few hundred million by jeopardizing the entire project.

Not sure if you're intentionally being super vague? In either case, it does not support your position to comment in this way. I'm open-minded though.

Bitcoin bull says markets will be bullish. Consider me surprised.

Correction, 97% of the people who submitted statements support Bitcoin. It's quite obvious that this was going to get brigaded by Bitcoin supporters, so these statistics really mean nothing and are not indicative of approval. They'll be ignored.

Bitcoin's fees are like several months worth of income for a Venezuelan. This is really \*not\* Bitcoin's time to shine.

Delegated proof of stake is a far better solution than both proof of stake and proof of work. You can assign power to whoever you want. That's how a democratic and decentralized system \_should\_ work. Your analogy is dumb to begin with though. In proof of stake if the supply is distributed you don't have to "just accept" changes to consensus. These changes are agreed upon by the majority of participants and enforced by the decentralized network. I think you know you're grasping at straws though.
And for the record, proof of work is a horribly inefficient solution with natural tendencies toward centralization. The political battles Bitcoin has gone through with miners in the past few years is testament to that. You're creating a playground with the whole objective of maximizing personal advantage at the expense of the system. What a terribly stupid idea. When Bitcoin finally forks away from proof of work it'll become a lot more viable. And by the way, don't forget how much money is invested in swaying popular opinion in relation to this. The mining industry is worth billions of dollars. Do you really think they can't afford to have an army of sockpuppets on here trying to dissuade people from thinking that mining is a negative? Wake up. The amount of money they stand to lose is insane.
