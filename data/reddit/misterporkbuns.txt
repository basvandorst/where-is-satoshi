I have the exact same situation as you.  I emailed them as well by responding to their order cancellation email.  I will keep you posted if I hear anything from them.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:13:35
there are two factors:
1) constantly increasing mining difficulty
2) constantly increasing ASIC efficiency
mining difficulty is predictable because thats built into the protocol, so if you take today's tech its true that it will take more electricity to mine Bitcoin than it did a year ago.
whats not predictable is increased ASIC efficiency, who knows what breakthroughs there will be in the near future.  maybe tomorrow someone invents a new ASIC that uses half the electricity but is twice as fast. 
anyway, these are the two factors.

Tech side, not hard.  There's open source exchange software available, so you'd just need to host that software at a scale that can handle all those transactions.  
Legal side, very hard.  You have to jump insane regulatory hurdles in order to tie your exchange to a US Bank account.  Also the regulations around this are still undefined.  This is the major roadblock at the moment. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:38:56
too much deflation, consumers hold.  too much inflation merchants hold.  end result for both is that the economy crumbles.  
i think bitcoin is going to succeed mostly as a commodity with a built in exchange system. which is great seeing as how gold is an 8 trillion dollar market.
as for a stable currency, i think another crypto-currency with built in checks and balances for deflation/inflation will likely be needed, perhaps pegging money supply to the number of active mining nodes somehow.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:39:08
1. just a natural way to redistribute wealth.  its happened and it'll happen again. bitcoin has been around for only 5 years and each time it happens more people get bitcoin and there's less and less to dump as early adopters cash out.  don't sweat it.
2. businesses like bitpay instantly converts BTC to USD on purchases so there's no risk.  as more support businesses like this grow up around bitcoin, we'll see BTC continue to rise in value living in parallel with fiat.  once btc reaches some level of stability or predictable growth, then perhaps we'll see merchants giving discounts for purchases with BTC instead of fiat.

whats your question?
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:23:42
Getting tired of CEOs screwing up and driving your company into the ground? Well why not run a company where there is no central authority and where the company strategy is coded into a protocol.
For example, you build this factory that can build more factories and self driving taxicabs. Then hit start.  The "genesis" fleet of cabs goes out and collect fares, which pays shareholders, pays the power bills and also builds additional factories and taxicabs. The cycle continues until you reach a predetermined number of taxicabs to serve the population.
In numbers we trust.

bitcoin is something the world has never seen.  a combination of currency, commodity, and payment system that is decentralized and extremely free flowing even across borders.  
economics 101, commodities 101, investment 101 may accurately describe bitcoin behavior for certain periods, but as for the long run, who knows? we'll know 100 years from now when they start teaching bitcoin 101 classes.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:29:22
yes.... still not sure what your question is, but remember number of miners means higher number of transactions.  the miners are needed to process those transactions.  
as the bitcoin economy grows, the value of bitcoin grows, the more miners it attracts, so more transactions can be processed, and so it follows more electricity will be needed to support that growing economy.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:02:07
most merchants are using bitpay which converts bitcoins into USD instantly so its not a problem. coinbase does the same too.

its incredible how they so aptly predicted the issues that are debated today.  
the positive feedback cycle predicted by satoshi.  the call for a more balanced currency by sepp echoes a lot of the criticisms we hear today about btc being too unstable as a currency.  satoshi even admits that btc is more like a precious metal.  they even touch upon regulations being a blocker.
seems like they knew exactly what they were doing.

You're right, people tracked their funds with online bank accounts, withdrew money from ATMs, and used credit cards before electricity was invented... oh wait.

The tricky part in determining the coin's value at a certain time in order to estimate inflation is what do you compare it against?  The dollar? The price of milk over time?  Not sure how'd you would bake that into the protocol.

same can be said for gains then.  the key is loss or gain of purchasing power, or exchange value vs a fiat
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:32:02
if you tell them you were flagged "high risk" in error and that you would like your original transaction honored.  i bought 5 BTC at $206 and got notified a week later that my transaction was cancelled.  i contacted them and 3 days later they contacted me back and pushed my transaction through at the original price, even though by that time BTC was at $500.  i'm sure they're really backed up right now with customer service due to the volume, but they'll get back to you.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:41:31
1) Due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin, I think we'll see more and more businesses offering discounts for BTC, especially after price increases have become historically predictable.
2) I think question 2 is a moot point for Bitcoin unfortunately. Even Satoshi himself stated that Bitcoin will act more like a precious metal (Source:  ; Satoshi's 3rd post)
3) Not yet, but there will be.  The first crypto-currency that can self-regulate inflation/deflation by adjusting its mining output and max limit in correlation to the number of users will become more useful as a medium of exchange.  I think inflation gets a bad rap because its been abused so much, but as with everything in this world, there has to balance.
4) already hit the nail on the head on this one.

@_date: 2013-11-23 01:10:49
email them and tell them your order was cancelled in error.  it may take 3-4 days to get back to you, but they'll honor your original price.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:48:51
email them telling them that you believe your order was incorrectly cancelled and that you want the original price honored.  also ask to be whitelisted so this doesn't happen in the future.  it may take them 3-5 days to get back to you, but they will honor the original price.  remember to include the transaction id in your response.  do not send them more than one email because each time you do, it gets kicked to the back of the queue.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:43:41
best advice is to not do short term investing.  you will almost certainly lose money doing this as a novice.  the market is too volatile and the exchanges are not reliable enough at the moment to do effective arbitrage.
as for long term investing, put only as much as you can afford to lose into BTC and then forget about it.  no one really knows where this is going.  there is great potential with btc, but also many hurdles.
its really as simple.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:17:53
- no counter party risk
- great properties as a currency - scarce, identifiable, divisible, high value to transportability ratio, fungible
- inflation at a predictable rate until 2140
- accessible to anyone with internet
- as it stands, system cannot support more than 7 transactions per second
- an alt-coin my prove to be significantly better at addressing known and unknown challenges

to be fair, people have started to regret having spent their bitcoins as seen by some of the posts here.  also merchants are only taking bitcoin with services like bitpay that converts btc straight into USD (virgin galactic did this).  not sure when, if ever, bitcoin can be the sole currency.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:11:01
this is arbitrage.  the reason why people haven't been successful doing this is the extreme volatility, liquidity issues, and exchange performance under high volume (lag or sometimes inability to make trades at all).
this makes it near impossible to time your trades.  you can wait for &gt;10%, but by the time you hit button or the order goes through it may have swung drastically to &lt;10%.
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:58:16
also, they'll honor your transaction at the original price

this article is incredibly short-sighted.  bitcoin cannot be analyzed as a currency because its not. its a combination of currency, commodity, and payment system.  and with properties that further differentiate it from those things. the world has never seen anything like it. 
just like there was no model to predict where the internet would go in the 90's, there is no economic model that suits bitcoin now. it may fit a certain model for certain periods in its development, but its combined properties mean that it will break out of that model and we've already seen 3 "bubble bursts" that haven't panned out.  no one knows what bitcoin is going to do, just that it has useful properties and people are seeing that.
