i'd recommend hiring a criminal lawyer with your private money, if your colleagues are only thinking about allowing any withdrawals before it's sure that 100% of your customer's funds are save

Bitfinex is structured in two British Virgin Islands companies (BFXNA Inc. for US customers, IFINEX Inc. for the rest of the world), BVI would be the relevant location for an insolvency class action. 
The principal place of business of IFINEX Inc. is 13/F, 1308 Bank of America Tower, 12 Harcourt Road, Central, Hong Kong. HK is also named as principal place of business for BFXNA Inc. [in this CFTC document]( and based their privacy policy 
so HK should have been the place for financial regulation and would probably the place for any criminal proceedings

from a security perspective yes. but the reason why Bitfinex chose this setup was to legally comply with the CFTC, not to improve security

yes, Bitfinex terms say "BitGo ... uses those keys to sign transactions as directed by Bitfinex"
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:09:36
not a big surprise that the transaction has been co-signed by BitGO. Bitfinex's terms clearly state that BitGO signs "transactions as directed by bitfinex". it's not BitGO's job to manually review transactions, their co-signing just prevents double spending.

they (two separate firms BFXNA Inc. for US customers and IFINEX Inc. for the rest of the world) are BVI companies

i doubt that they will be allowed to withdraw anything to anyone in the current situation.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:51:13
no, does not seem plausible because the system was not in place for "several months"
it's more plausible that there weren't "good limits" in place and that BitGo had the contractual obligation to sign every transaction "as directed by Bitfinex" (bitfinex.com/terms)

I'd say it's relatively big news that Virtu, one of the largest market making / high frequency trading firms in the world, wants to start Bitcoin trading. 
Virtu was founded by Vincent Viola, a billionaire who was until last Friday Trump's nominee for United States Secretary of the Army, [before dropping out due to ethics concerns](

that's not a source, this article claims "according to Bloomberg News" probably only citing the ZH post 
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:09:35
the article on Sina.com.cn is also writing "according to Bloomberg News", so it's not the source.

1. Renrenbee Limited, formerly named "Bitfinex Limited", the Hong Kong company that acts as Money Service Operator for Bitfinex, is now owned by Digfinex Inc. and is not part of the IFinex Inc. equity-for-tokens offering. It used to be ["wholly owned by iFinex"]( This company (as MSO licensed entity) is very likely one of the most valuable parts of the "Bitfinex Group" for investors. 
2. contracts between Tether, Renrenbee and iFinex (and its subsidiaries) as well as payments (e.g. salaries) for people that are senior managers and shareholders at the same time create possible conflicts of interest. this structures needs at least more transparency and/or more rights for minority shareholders. 
3. Zane Tackett (apparently deceived creditors by stating "We have investments in Blockstream, Shapeshift, Netki and Tether" on the question "What are the things Bitfinex owns for example?", source:  (timecode 20:09)

Digfinex Inc. already existed before the hack, at least since March 2016. the problem is that they made creditors (token holders) and potential investors believe that iFinex Inc. is the parent company of the [Bitfinex Group]( whereas it's only a subsidiary that does not control key assets of the group. For sure Renrenbee Limited is part of the "Bitfinex Group", it probably shares personnel and resources with iFinex and its subsidiaries.

Bitfinex has invested in Blockstream's seed round [according to Zane Tackett]( they (Digfinex Inc., not iFinex Inc.) are very likely small minority shareholders of Blockstream.

the rule of law only applies if it is written in a smart contract?

the largest position of their assets is &gt;€500 billion "positive market values from derivative financial instruments", most of it (&gt;€300 billion) is related to OTC interest rate derivatives.
