Bitcoin Core version 0.16.1 is now available for download. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this maintenance release that fixes several bugs and provides backports of new minor features, such as:
Mitigating a vector for denial-of-service attacks. This attack required compromising particular services and would’ve probably been most effective against nodes that were started for the first time (rather than nodes that had already been connected to the network for more than a few hours).
Fixing a bug that could’ve potentially caused miners to lose revenue if they produced two blocks in very rapid succession.
Ceasing relay of transactions using the rarely-seen OP_CODESEPARATOR opcode for legacy (non-segwit) signature scripts. The presence of this opcode makes it difficult for nodes to estimate how much computational work will be required to validate a legacy signature script. Because of that, it blocks the deployment of solutions to prevent attackers from creating blocks that require a long time to validate. By itself, this change to relay policy doesn’t fix the problem itself, but it does make it easier and safer to deploy proposed solutions in the future should users consent to adopt them.
For a complete list of changes, please see the release notes. If have any questions, please stop by our IRC chatroom and we’ll do our best to help you.

"The future: P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses
As final preparations are being made to release Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, segregated witness has activated on the Bitcoin network and is now ready to use.
Bitcoin Core has supported creating segwit addresses since 0.13.0, but this support was designed for testing has only been available to expert users—we were waiting to see if segwit was adopted before adding segwit support to the regular user interfaces, both graphical and RPC.
The timing of segwit lock in and activation meant that we had to choose between either delaying the planned release of 0.15.0 and all its features described above or shipping 0.15.0 without a user interface defaulting to segwit.
We decided to take the later option, but we’re also not going to wait the normal six months before the next major update. Instead, our next feature release will generate segwit-compatible addresses by default. This will be made available as soon as it has been written and thoroughly tested.
For those of you interested in technical details, our plan is to use P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses that are compatible with nearly all other wallets on the network. We may support sending to Bech32 native segwit addresses generated by other wallets, but the graphical user interface will probably not support generating Bech32 addresses itself until a subsequent release."

Concept ACK - Agree with the idea and overall direction, but haven't reviewed the code changes or tested them.
utACK (untested ACK) - Reviewed and agree with the code changes but haven't actually tested them.
Tested ACK - Reviewed the code changes and have verified the functionality or bug fix.
ACK - A loose ACK can be confusing. It's best to avoid them unless it's a documentation/comment only change in which case there is nothing to test/verify; therefore the tested/untested distinction is not there.
NACK - Disagree with the code changes/concept. Should be accompanied by an explanation.
