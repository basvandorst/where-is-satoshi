Thanks for telling me what to do with my money, I appreciate.
Still would be very pleased to known what do you think that might pull btc bellow 9K

It might be.
Being a bullish myself I tend to stick to bullish patterns more easily than bearish.
What bearish patterns do you see?

Most of the times that is a result of speculation due to lack of market regulation. Wales, the ones that have huge amounts, sell bellow market price to pull it down, then buy strong while the price is much lower.
The same happens otherwise and people use to call it pump and dump

Or the miners lose interest due to inefficient reward and start getting out, making the transactions slower and more expensive. People will start declining bitcoin and exchanging it by other crypto currency pushing btc price lower.
Its is a market and the variables are so immense that I doubly believe that anyone can predict anything that long term.
I really believe that one day crypto currency, or any other similar solution, will substitute feduciary. But we all must not forget that once there is a sufficiently big quantum computer able to break sha256 bitcoin will be useless.
Although I love cryptocurrency I feel that it is not the future due to insecurity issues in 10 or 20 years. Nevertheless this is absolutely the beginning of a new Era and soon someone will bring a solution to last thousands of years more

- macd a going to 0
- diagonal support at 9500
- fib at 9000
- fib matrix next higher from 9000 to 11500
- above BB(20) support 
- RSI bearish congruence 
- bearish channel
- bearish flag
If the 24H candle closed green we have a bullish hammer and the market might reach 11500 in 7-10 days, otherwise it might go bellow 9K

Most often it is.

In that situation I guess by the supply increase the cost of it would decrease largely

All those who short made more

Well it seams that I didn't miss by far... ��

I mean new target.
For the past 6 months or so we're been having a new maximum each 50 days or so and a new minimum with the same period but fased roughly 25 days.
Please take a look to my latest post in which I explain the study.
My targets have been being correct to the price and day  day since may

I'll stick to my long since Aug 31
