Is LN going to help transfer bitcoin form wallet A to wallet B with super low fees?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:37:24
No one cares about 1 bitcoin... Normal transaction is 20-30$.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:47:15
Why such fake sh*t is allowed here?
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:59:45
Mehhh, bunch of big words with no arguments.
For starters, what will save bitcoin from high fees? 
Lightning Network? It will make transfers from wallet A to wallet B, super cheap? A few cents? Free?

We see "high fee" panic. Not anything else.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:05:40
Why do we need those nodes? Aren't miners all that matters? Aren't they are the only ones who confirm transactions and also take fee money?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:52:00
Right now bitcoin is falling because everyone is afraid of super high fees.

Why miners don't want to increase block size? They want bitcoin to die?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:29:48
Well... It's not 130$, like someone says.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:47:18
Prepare to wait at least 10 years until price goes to 20k again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:06:25
All cryptos are dying.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:45:42
Not bitcoin, all cryptocurrencies dying right now...
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:45:46
And MANY of my friends now has THOUSANDS and thousands of looses... And they wont have gains until price reaches at least 15k...
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:48:16
Only an idiot would do that.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:02:46
99.99% are here to MAKE MONEY.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:49:13

@_date: 2018-02-08 06:47:00
Why not 50000000000000000000000 ?
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:51:26
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:49:42
And you think this is a good thing?
