Many thanks for the answer and link. I found it greatly informative and patched my holes in bitcoin knowledge!

Somehow people outside Russia and eastern europe fail to see it is completely the opposite:
russians are not interested in holding the BTC as an asset - they just want to escape rouble - so they buy tc with rouble, and SELL btc for usd - so they are actualy now sinking the btc. They dont care about btc - they just have problems exchanging rub to usd on the streets, so technicaly advanced people mainly use BTC-e for converting rub to usd through btc. they do not care about large fees (7% cash-out for paypal) - rouble falls 5-7% a day, so that is no biggie.

This is what I have been saying long ago. We need to complete the circle to make BTC shine with advantages. Till now it did not cut down transaction costs due to the fact you had to convert FIAT 2 times to successfully transfer using BTC. If we can make the circle of life complete:
     -&gt;bussiness -&gt; wage--
    |                     |
     -product &lt;-employee&lt;-
ONLY then we get the full advantages of btc's speed and cost-effective nature
This is a step in right direction!

Flibbr stop trolling. Ty.
@_date: 2015-01-08 13:04:53
+1 on that. I thought about this for a moment after posting. 
Could You share a way of correcting this or determining how big of an error it could create on the end result?
I, somehow, intrinsically, feel it does introduce only a small error on the end result... No?
@_date: 2015-01-10 08:01:21
That is exactly what i am saying here. Miners are one of those few who, in fact, can EARN btc providing some sort of service. Earn as an employee. Work for BTC.
For now most companies accepting BTC instantly convert it to USD or EUR, but we have to find ways to complete the BTC circle without using USD as the middleman. While USD is in this BTC circulation circle, the BTC can not unveil its true bonuses: fee-less transactions,speed and anonimity.

I am actually bag HODLER now. Too uncertain to trade now, as a lot of exchanges are overflooded with shorts..

Because just opening exchange wont get us to the  moon
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:17:01
This is somewhat avoided by algo also. 
If, later on, you start to dump massively, you can dump through some orderbooks, but you also bring the price down... It does not give you as muchas as it seems at a glance..

I, kinda, not trying to sell something, but develop something for free, that community would find useful. 
If it would be useful, i believe, some people would donate.
If it is do-able ammount of work, I am just trying to find new hobby project useful for BTC\btc-trader comunity.

These maths are relative, as i am using result further on to calculate it RELATIVE. It does not matter I had chosen 1% in between, as i got 186USD/BTC relative to that 1%

we have had a lot of them :D 'nuff

If BTC slowly WOULD take over, then M3 should not grow but shrink, as banksters would be unable to print money ot of thin air. 
Also, I used the:


M3 could grow only by the amount real economies grow - developing countries joining the overall worlds GDP

Only way would be micro-time-traveling: traveling ~10mins back in time each time, so you "mine" that block first, even after someone else has found it (if i understand protocol correctly. Maybe i do not) :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:28:21
On the nonce - nice.
But damn, yeah, you are good on the ASIC part.... Sad, that there is some loophole tho :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:34:16
Thanks - Your approach seem much more logical.
We just have to overcome hoarding and speculation as main means of utility. If we use it as commodity it will stay as commodity and wont mature for use as real currency.
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:56:06
I see you do not agree on my opinions on price, but I would like to hear something constructive - care to share how would you determine the price, so it would not be:


If the market cap grows, I would price it accordingly to that from this point.
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:28:48
That is why I just now concluded, that it is still following 1200 bubble and will continue to fall (as it is already happening)

Yeah, and buyer pays 1/20th of the goats price in fees.. Good job!

It is rare occasion, but I laughed out loud. 
This is the second vid from the guy - previous one was also bold!

There is no such problem in BCH!

Define Bitcoin..?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:16:13
Have you thought ahead a bit?
How many new users are added to BTC each day?
How many users can be supported with 3tx/s?
How many of new users are deterred away from BTC, when they see their first transactions fee is 5$, 10$?
If you think it is SPAM, FUD or whatever causing it now, it wont matter after a year, because after a year there will be more new users doing transactions than there is this "SPAM" now.
What will happen then?
How many coins are irreversibly stuck in addresses not meaningful to spend anymore? Is that ok?
If we consider BTC as settlement or store of value system, after a year it wont be usable for that eather, because IT WILL BE OVERCROWDED and everyone will have to compete with their TX fee to get TX through. Why the fees? It just eats away this value you are trying to store.
There is not one scenario this can end well.
Segwit and LN solves nothing. Nothing.
even 50% increase of throughput wont cut it - after a year that will be depleted because of new users and you will be left with technical debt of its implementation
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:37:29
You have a bad system if this "attack" of "people transacting electronic cash" clogs the system up. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:16:11
Bitcoin is not under attack - market just has noticed S1X is just not of any value and everyone is running for exit.
If you thought Core will be able to troll and strangle scaling indefinately, you were proven wrong.
RemindMe! 6 months
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:15:36


this is not true: if the alt is supported my those who consider themselves god here, it is allowed (bGold)
Also there is different attitude discussing different proposals for scaling:
* discussing segwit is allowed
* discussing bigger blocks are mostly instantly censored
* discussing pow change is somehow allowed 
Biggest problem seems to be: there are no hard rules on what is allowed and what isnt - it is always mods SUBJECTIVELY decide on each occasion
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:47:01
You know why is that so?
Because all the weak hands sold their BCH to them at 0.04BTC
All the fools selling BCH gave it to, mostly, WHALES!

DAFUQ did you just wrote??? It is completely opposite + there is 2-way replay protection implemented on BCH fork, so it is not in danger of reply attacks and also coins on other side of the fork are safe

Sell now, rebuy later ;)
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:22:57
Any fixed block size is retarded - there has to be dynamic formula that calculates optimal size relative to other network stats - just like difficulty adjustment.
If it wont be implemented like that, we will have these discussions every year - that is RETARDED!
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:33:35
You can consider me big-blocker for this viewpoint, but it has to have correlation to combination of 
* mempool size
* block "fullness"
* minimum fee that were included in last block
If the minimum fee that were included in last block is getting over some (fixed or dynamically calculated) threshold, increase blocksize for next X blocks, if the fee were lower, decrease it.
This can be done also for "small blocker" agenda, but having it fixed to some arbitrary 1Mb is just borrowing time and it is guaranteed we will have these stupid unproductive blocksize discussions forever, no matter how big the blocks will be - be it 1Mb, 300kb, 8Mb or 1Gb - fixed size is stupid -
**there has to be automatically adjusted blocksize that fulfills all the needs - fees(if we want those) and scaling**
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:36:59
Like FIAT
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:26:36
You cant assume or even hope the forked-off chain will have any price for the coin or hashrate following it. It MIGHT even be the TRUE or the REAL or the BEST by technical merits, but it wont matter. It will be THE FORK - the original chain will just move on like nothing happened and casual users will just keep using that one.
If you need an example, there is BCC/BCH.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:50:53
Timing was exact - rollercoaster down started few hours later.
I think it will go back to 3-3,6k USD based on past correction percentages
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:04:35
But I am giving them my support! 
What now?
How are we gonna solve this? I think it is only logical to let both chains live and market will decide!
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:18:28
It is not sustainable to have this momentum forever - there is 100% chance this will pop in 1h-2days.

AFAIK you will not be able successfully run multiple nodes on same PC - uses the same ports.
Also - it is quite stupid for non-miner and non-business entity to run a node - only hashpower votes.

I dont think you understand the economics here - if yoy change POW, YOU are the one who forked off, not them...

S2X is corporate takeover because it will be forked from S1X that has been corporate takeover all along!
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:35:51
After majority of hashpower leaves, Your haspower might be 10% of the total, so at that point in time you will greatly help to keep S1X afloat!
