What's the problem with bigger blocks? That the Blockchain will be too big as a result? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:17:37
Sorry but I think you missed the whole point of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:58:09
Well one might argue it's already been brought back in the form of bitcoin cash. I mean yeah I also thought Bitcoin was the way to go but it's just not usable for the average joe. 
Or I mean Eth processes so many transactions and the fees are totally okay.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:17:24
But this way only rich people or organizations can send transactions...
And aren't transaction costs higher than the price of hard drives? Plus with stuff like siacoin and storj there could be en easy solution.

Do your own homework mate or click sort by top all 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:18:39
Well the way I understand it bitcoin changed and bitcoin cash went back to the original stuff from the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:34:39
Probably. Followed by a massive crash. The bankers want to make an example out of btc. So the mainstream looses trust. Also bitcoin cash is coming to big exchanges early January.
I'm ready for the crash, but the risk reward could be worth staying in for now. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:39:52
Bitcoin Messias? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:45:23
But cause bitcoin cash is also bitcoin. Maybe even more so... 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:20:04
Well I've been bitcoiner since 2014 and for me bitcoin no longer has any utility.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:04:51
;) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:29:33
Well in the end the market will decide. I'm mainly into ethereum but I've moved all my btc to bch. Because btc is overvalued and can't be used, bch is usable able and has the entrepreneurial drive behind it that brought bitcoin to where it is now.
I mean make your own decision, I believe 2018 will bring big changes. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:06:58
Well Satoshi said in the future bitcoin will either be worth millions or nothing.
Besides that it's technologcally inferior but it has the first mover advantage. That's pretty much it, it's expensive to transfer and slow.
And for all the other people saying bitcoin  has this long track record of being secure. So does bitcoin  cash, it's the same coin or it was the same coin till it split.
ETH and bch have the brightest future in my mind but ofc bitcoin could just survive on the name. Noone knows.
Bitcoi  has become the starter coin for many cause its the first thing they hear about but if you know the tech and the facts you should make your own decision 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:41:44
Who knows maybe it'll soon be bitcoin  core and bitcoin  cash and the  bitcoin and bitcoin core or legacy or segwit or whatever other names bitcoin goes by already 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:43:10
The value is always supposed to be 1$ so after a huge pump you could change to tether wait out the dip and buy back. But then if tether goes bust you're screwed. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:35:20
I think it goes deeper. With Satoshi having disappeared we can't know if he'd prefer bitcoin cash or bitcoin.
For the time being they both are bitcoin, and which ever one works better will be the one that ends 2018 with a higher value. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:23:55
Satoshi vision has nothing to do with bitcoin? So you rename visa to bitcoin it is bitcoin? Just because of the name? The mechanics matter more than the name.
Whichever is closer to the white paper should be called bitcoin imo. It's just better for New users.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:25:53
That's where you're wrong kiddo.
Or at least that's where we disagree. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:21:42
Same here something like 2% of my portfolio. It's sad to see what bitcoin has turned in to. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:07:09

Bitcoin cash is not an Altcoin. That's just ignorant. It's a hard fork, meaning that up until that point they were the same.
I thought like you too but slowly started switching because realistically there is so much better tech
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:18:23
Maybe bitcoin just isn't the best coin anymore?
Bring on the downvotes! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:39:35
Anybody who says the know is lying 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:06:46
Well then you must remember what it was like... Today is far from it better off using visa than btc
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:16:04
The whole spirit of bitcoin as a financial revolution moved to bitcoin cash.
Bitcoin core is run by old money now and its just an asset now. Rather than scaling in accordance with Satoshis plan (bigger blocks in the Blockchain) bitcoin core enabled segwit (removing signatures from blocks to save space) and the lightning network (off chain transactions that require trust.
Basically bitcoin is no longer bitcoin, that's why the banks aren't scared any more. It's a great opportunity for them ��
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:00:55
Increasing block size is not a quick fix. It's the intended fix.
In the beginning there was no block size limit and it was only added to prevent a poison block attack. Now core doesn't want to remove it because they dont want bitcoin to be useful as a currency.
Segwit undermines bitcoins security by removing signatures from blocks and the lighnint network if far to complicated for the average user to ever use.
Satoshi said increase block size, gavin andersen said increase block size. What more do you want?
But i mean the true bitcoin has always been called a scam. First in BTC and now the up-hill battle continues in BCH.
I just want to help you understand. The market will proove me right in the long-run.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:40:05
Its the denial phase. He'll learn the hard way
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:43:06
I don't think bitcoin cash should be tricking people into using it either. However I do think it is bitcoin.
I mean in the split they could just as well have ended up with the name. Btc implemented segwit and the ln which both change the core functionality of bitcoin in unforseen ways.
I strongly disagree with "we don't need every retail transaction stored for ever on the Blockchain" because that is how bitcoin works. That's the whole underlying technology that made it so successful in the beginning.
Right now the only value bitcoin has come from the fact its used to buy other crypto currencies. It isn't a revolutionary new monetary system anymore. That spirit &amp; that part of the community moved to bch.
And I really don't understand the ver hate. He was the first investor in bitcoin startups and was very well regarded in the community before the split. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:46:13
Bitcoin in a nutshell. If you still believe in the whole be your own bank bitcoin cash is for you. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:30:30
Ln is a pain and not a valid solution to scaling. Consider using bitcoin cash ✌️ low fees and you can always exchange to btc if you like 
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:24:31
Because high fees and slow transactions turned bitcoin in to a store of value. Bch is continuing where bitcoin left off, according to Satoshis own scaling plan (raising the block limit)
There's just a buttload of disinformation going around and ofc this comment will be downvoted by shills.
If you truly believe in bitcoin I recommend doing your own research ✌️
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:35:14
Gavin Andersen who was the lead developer said in a tweet "bitcoin cash is what I started working on in 2010 a store of value AND medium of exchange" 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:39:44
Bruv I've been using bitcoin for a while and I've always had to pay these fees. Well the last weeks have been extra bad.
Don't accuse me. I got called a /r /bitcoin troll on btc and IL tell you why I told them. I don't care i use and own both. 
If high fees like that aren't normal help mit figure out the problem. I'm using the ledger bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:29:36
Yeah those are an issue but there are many coins that solve it. Bch is just gonna confuse people. Totally unnecessary 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:22:48
Yeah best idea now is to buy it. Mining is still possible but not affordable for the average consumer.
You can also earn bitcoin by mining other crypto currencies :) 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:44:50
Seems a little biased, looking at the title no wonder :P
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:12:02
What I mean is they tip. There was a post here yesterday talking how heed been sent over 200$ in a week for making memes bashing I don't disagree with Bch. I own it but overall I'm more of an ethereum guy. Just the community is so toxic sometimes. I don't get it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:29:46
Bitcoin mining is a bad idea. Maybe mine another currency but even then you're probably better of just investing in a currency.
You could get some graphics cards to mine for you tho 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:41:11
I'll give you 0.03 ��
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:15:23
There is an upcoming hard fork and many people are probably gonna switch to alternatives like Ethereum, lite coin or bitcoin cash. Noone knows for sure what will happen but Bitcoin is just technologically inferior due to slow transactions and high fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:25:40
I like scan.co.uk they're in the UK but ship to Europe. Got some gpus there. Also I believe case king in Germany accepts bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:35:19
Wallets are supposed to be tamper proof so it should be fine but I mean you never know 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:38:49
Yeah that is pretty high but normal for bitcoin. Try ethereum monero lite coin bitcoin cash etc for low fees and faster transactions. Bitcoin is working on fixing this I think
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:46:46
Iota has always been on my watch list huge potential! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:59:29
Why dont you start a new subreddit? CryptoBusiness or something.
I would also like to know, I had a pretty cool idea recently and would love a place to find serious people.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:53:29
Well I'm not sure. The reason he got so mad was that the core team kind of destroyed what bitcoin could have been.
You probably know vitalik buterin wanted to build ethereum on the bitcoin network. Well bitcoin cash is working on tokens, I think they're called colored coins.
My point is the reason he's so angry is the ignorance he's faced with everyday and yeah it does make him look bad but i can understand.
The worst thing you can do is lable and dismiss him. He did so much for the bitcoin community he deserves a chance. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:40:28
That's now but a few years ago he was the face of bitcoin.
I remember watching g a documentary back then I think banking on bitcoin and they talked about him a lot. Like his criminal charges being bs and I mean revoking us citizenship is an extremely noble act imo
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:28:44
You guys know ver helped bitcoin immensely right? 
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:39:04
What are you talking about cash is adding colored coins and all that. BTC isn't open to innovation. That's why ethereum exists.
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:44:50
Bitcoin core a s bitcoin cash went with different solutions to the scing problem. Core decided segwit and lightning network should do the trick, whereas bitcoin cash stuck to the original plan.
To answer your original question, why isn't is just another coin? Because it's a bitcoin fork but unlike gold diamond or whatever it goes back all the way to beginning of the chain. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:21:17
Well in my opinion the brand and the logo and everything was made for the bitcoin technology. Right? People understood the vision and contributed. It's all based on the white paper.
If Satoshi says bitcoin  will split and the longer chain is bitcoin then I think we should agree with that.
However that's not what happened the longest chain is called bitcoin cash. So who really hijacked the name and logo? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:38:49
Oh I see, so it's not so much a wallet as it is a key?
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:47:00
I mean yeah those do seem very appealing but I don't have that much BTC yet.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:55:03
I've got everything in Circle right now, not a fan of it thought and looking to move it out asap :D
