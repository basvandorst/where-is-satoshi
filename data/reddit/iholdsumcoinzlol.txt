I think it's a good thing because people that haven't heard of bitcoin yet are like tf is this? Then they proceed to google it and find out it's way cheaper to buy it online so they're like ayyy good deal lets get some

Wtf? Honestly this made me hate Roger Ver and his shitty altcoin even more. I knew he was a clown but spreading bs like this took it to another level
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:38:21
Yeah sure we need to focus on making BTC better. It starts with keeping it real and exposing all bs that comes out of Ver's mouth. The only way the BCH community is focused on innovating is by spreading lies, I mean look at this screenshot it's pathetic

Honestly as someone who never thought he would sell, I actually sold a decent amount last week. My instinct says it will go lower so I simply go by that. Nobody of us knows where it'll go this year so just listen to your own gut instinct and act accordingly.

Nobody really knows if selling now is a 'bad' decision. I did dollar cost average my way in and also way out. I made profit and do feel comfortable right now. All we really have is our thought process and belief system. I used to listen to my belief system more and just "hold" like we all love to shout. I started thinking with more clarity and came to the conclusion to sell now. I truly do believe in bitcoin's potential, but it's in a too early state. I really hope bitcoin will go up big time but it takes more than what most people think. I will be back once it meets the criteria I currently have set in my mind.

Lol nah.. There's no reason to lose faith if you know the fundamentals of BTC. It'll be 25k USD by the end of this year. After that it will take off to 80k USD throughout the year. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:04:11
