Very cool.
Had to spend all my BTC on an pet emergency this week, otherwise I'd buy a bunch right now. :)

No problem, I understand the hesitation.
Just going to state, this isn't an app, it's a .ini(text file) file that can be opened in a text editor and viewed easily.  It's a skin for a widely known app. (rainmeter)

I like it a lot, already using it in place of the previous ones I used, mainly for the nice notifications. Only problem so far, is the decimal text is getting cut off on the BTC ticker.     
A couple suggestions:  
An audible chime option when a threshold is met, (subtle one that wont scare the crap out of me when I forget about it, like my phones ticker does. lol)and a setting that lets you define how long a notification stays on screen.

Down for only some it seems. Mine's been mining fine. Had disconnects yesterday, but always came back.

Yea, I had a look around too. Not much to be done about that. Could prob lower the text size, but that looks pretty bad.
Awesome about the other features. Can't wait! Been using it sense I saw this post. It's been working flawlessly.

Very cool. Looks nice too.
[Rdio]( would be a nice addition to the music section as well. :)

I used them once to convert BTC to paypal. Was quick and didn't have any problems.

Yup, getting that too. Loads up every other refresh of the page though.

Added my refreshed 6 votes again. :)

Completely redid it. It not requires the Gnometer Suite skin pack as well. Looks a lot better this way, and the color/size is easily customizable in the gnometer settings.
Not sure if I'll do anything else, unless it's wanted/needed.

Guessing this was meant for me.
Looking back at my paypal statement, I wasn't charged a fee. They may have payed it on their side though.
Also note, they don't always have paypal funds to pay out.(at least the last time I checked) It will tell you when you try if they do or not.
