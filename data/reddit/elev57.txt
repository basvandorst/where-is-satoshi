People will rarely have enough cash on hand to afford a house. Moreover, people might be more loath to make large purchases because they could wait and hope their saving appreciate more, making their purchases even cheaper. Also, it would make it difficult to make multiple large purchases at the same time because they would still be loath to opt for financing options. So, you might not be able to afford or be willing to purchase a car, washing machine, and house in the same time period.

Who are we talking about? The world at large? Regardless, the ghost cities were built as a means to offload excess capital, maintain growth, and keep people employed, not really as a means to meet increased housing demand. When you consider a state with markets more governed by supply and demand, like the US, you'll see a depression in new housing starts as currency experiences disinflation or deflation.
