With Schnorr signatures, you could connect to all the visible nodes at once, in which case the network would be extremely robust. Or maybe that's a terrible idea--I'm not technically sound enough to determine.

"You don't bring in someone to fight the wolves, you armor the sheep." Such a great line. If you bring in someone to fight the wolves, they will strike a deal with the wolves, screw you over, and split the profit. That's what all the credit rating agencies did in 2008.

There is really no hard evidence for this. It's a theory that makes some logical sense, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily true. Many things in life are non-intuitive which is why science is based on evidence not conjecture. I would love to see this hypothesis be rigorously tested, however at this point there is no proof that increasing the block size will significantly change the number of full nodes in the network.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:08:29


Some people have bought into the idea that any block size increase, at anytime is bad (and they happen to be very vocal on this sub). This is an extreme view, which most people do not actually hold. Nearly all Core developers agree a block size increase will be needed at some point and will improve bitcoin. For example: 
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:59:57
Yes, I agree 100%. Any suggested change to the status quo bears the burden of proof.
My gripe is that people toss out conjectures as if they are fact. I haven't seen any compelling evidence that there is a strong correlation between block size and number of nodes. It would be interesting to try and quantify the relationship. Then the model accuracy could be tested as the use of SW picks up and the blocks get bigger.

Actually, I don't really want a hard fork right now. That wasn't my point at all.

You cannot mine with CPU or GPU these days. For an individual, ASICs are barely profitable when all your costs are factored in (hardware, electricity, etc). It's a nice idea, but mining is not a good business to get into these days.

1. Educate yourself about the technical aspects of bitcoin. I don't mean just watch a 3 minute Youtube video--take some time to understand the technology behind what you are buying. What is SHA-256? What is a full node? What is the nonce? Be able to answer these questions.
2. The price moves a lot very unpredictability. Are you willing to hodl without getting scared and selling? If you bought bitcoin at around $1200 in 2013 and held until today you would have made a nice profit. However, you would have been in the negative for over 3 years. If we enter a bear market, will you have the guts to stick it out? Are you okay with potentially tying up your money for several years?
3. Secure your coin. Stolen bitcoin cannot be recovered. Lost bitcoin cannot be recovered. You and you alone are responsible for making sure your bitcoin is safe. If you don't feel qualified to secure your bitcoin, do some more research until you do. Be able to answer: how have people lost bitcoin in the past? What were they doing wrong?

Gemini used to be the shit. 0.25% fees and great customer service. I recommended Gemini to all my friends. Now it's just a worse version of Coinbase.
There is no way I'm paying 2% to buy, and then 2% to sell. That's robbery. I'm out.

That is my exact point. Operative word: "*transfer*"
Bitcoin can be a store of value, but only secondarily. Primary use must be value transfer for this thing to last.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:48:07


Not even close to true. Companies (and cryptocurrencies) provide value to the economy, so they increase the total value distributed to share holders (or coin holders).
Shit companies (and shit coins) loose money for their respective holders, but it's by no means a zero sum game.

Yeah you can. You can't predict the cards better, but you can improve your betting strategy. Terrible example--actually proves the opposite of your point.

That's exactly what he is saying. I moved away from the bitcoin community about a year ago because it got taken over by speculators who don't actually like bitcoin as a technology. Everything that attracted me to bitcoin means nothing to these people. Every post or comment I used to make got some response to the tune of "bitcoin is stupid, I'm just trying to ride the bubble up".
I'm just popping back into the sub today for the first time in about 6 months. I was hoping these folks had gotten shaken out by the dip, but I can see I came back too soon. We need bitcoin to drop down to $1000 or so and grow more organically along with adoption.
I parked all my holdings in a Ledger, and I don't know or really care what it's worth at the moment. I'll be back when bitcoin goes back to being about making permissionless value *transfers* without a third party. That's what is exciting to me. Not hoarding a pile of coins and watching the price fluctuations day to day.

I'm not trying to get out of taxes. I'm just wondering if the move reset my cost basis and triggered a taxable event. Before and after I had *identical amounts of btc and usd*. I'd rather pay taxes when I actually sell for real.

It's actually the reverse. Way more weak hands now, so the crash should be worse.

But gold has two things bitcoin doesn't. A multi-thousand year history and intrinsic utility (electronics, jewelry, etc). You can't expect bitcoin instantly to be the new gold.
That being said, I'm more bullish on bitcoin than gold. This stance is completely contingent on bitcoin gaining much more utility than where it is today. If people aren't actively transacting with bitcoin, there is nothing to prop up the price besides speculation which is extremely cyclical and unstable.
I don't really care if transactions are on or off chain (I'd personally prefer most to eventually be off-chain). But either way, mass use is the only way forward long term. Otherwise bitcoin will just be bubble-pop-bubble-pop rinse and repeat for the next 50 years.

Damn, that is a savvy point. I looked at the chart and was like this thing ain't over yet, but the truth is nobody knows. $4000 wouldn't surprise me at all, but neither would a pop back to 10-15k.

I'm not hoping for a future blockchain to have more utility. I'm hoping for bitcoin itself to gain more utility.
Forking does not inherently dilute value. I can spin up an infinite number of forks of bitcoin at any time, but they only have value if they attract users (for network effect). Despite dozens of forks of bitcoin, only b-cash diluted the value, but only very marginally. If you look at the BTC/BCH combination, BTC has 96% of the value while BCH has 4%. Considering BTC swings +/- 10% in \*a single day\*, this is nothing to be concerned about.
The confusion aspect is real, but it has to do with branding not the technology. I can make a new worthless currency and call it bitcoin 2.0 and try to trick people into buying it. If I did this, I would expect the crypto community and media to reject my name as too confusing/misleading.
The fact that people are allowing a forked chain with fewer users, less mining hashrate, and a fraction of the value to free load off of bitcoin's brand is baffling to me. I'm all for competition, and I'm on record supporting b-cash as an interesting side project. That being said, it is not bitcoin and should not contain "bitcoin" anywhere in its name.

That's ironic because I don't consider button pushing to even be engineering. You guys are more like artists weaving a complex tapestry, requiring tremendous creativity and vision.
There does seem to be an attitude among non-technical folk that engineers should just "make it work" not realizing the effort or challenges involved. Good engineering is definitely taken for granted among the general public.

Suppose I had some bitcoin on an exchange, and my friend wanted some but didn't have an account. I sent him let's just say 0.5 btc, and then I immediately re-bought the same amount from the exchange. Then my friend wrote me a check for the money. Is this a taxable event for me?
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:37:41
You only cut losses if an investment is dropping in value. Bitcoin is increasing in value (with occasional blips in price).
So called, "bag holding" has been the most profitable strategy, although you are misusing the term.
The market cannot be timed. If you do, you got lucky. If you "cut losses", you will get burned.

That is definitely a fair point. There is a sliding fee schedule based on your trade volume.
I guess I was addressing the retail investors like myself. I've been with them for over a year now, and as far as I know, being a recent or longtime customer has no basis on the fees you pay.
