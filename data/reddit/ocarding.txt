“Beware of articles coming out of those publications”? 
We publish topical news stories that are of interest to our readers/ the community 
Should we just post celebratory stories about yet another all time high ? 
It’s not FUD and why would it benefit the site owners or our writers if we were to try and devalue Bitcoin?

If anyone fancies another puzzle. I gave away this print at a conference which also has a Qr code on it with a prize at the end.
It was a bit too convoluted and wacky so no one ever claimed the prize.

"Cointelegraph had not responded to a request for comment at time of press.
Without dwelling wholly on the negative, we should also note the companies that gave a clear refusal to run any content that was sponsored without a clear label: BraveNewCoin, Coinjournal, CryptosRus, CCN, Mineable, Oracle Times, and ZyCrypto."

I can see them now. Thanks and keep up the good work, I like the site. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:22:29
You've not included Bitcoin Magazine, or Coinjournal

Beat me to it!

Looks shit!
These are much better and cheaper: 
Also, &gt; 50 upvotes for a mug? This is obvious upvote manipulation.

Biased.. But there's already independent and high quality journalism in the space (albeit alongside a lot of corruption and paid links) 
Jimmy, what do you think you can add to the space and what are your journalists objectives ?
Are you going to be hiring writers who are already well versed in Bitcoin?

Ian Demartino's book for reference: 
It's a very good read and well worth buying.

They aren’t going to be to everyone’s taste, but some people will like them. There are often examples of art on here so I disagree that this is shilling, or gorilla marketing, though I do like the pun ! 
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:54:40
Thanks for ripping off our art work, I think you forgot to remove the watermark though 
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:31:20
Yup, very familiar with the history of Godzilla, but it doesn’t mean history has to repeat itself and from where I’m standing it looks like he’s getting his ass kicked!!

Yeah, but based on that analogy, technology at the broadest level has no barrier, however if people aren’t given opportunities, or incentivised then they can’t work in the space. The article explains there’s a lot of great work being carried out by women in the space, but more can be done.

Is this sand bar in Manchester ?

The print isn’t for sale on the store (Or at all for that matter) so I don’t see how sharing the image is a problem. 
In fact, the only thing it’s promising is a free, grassroots event !

Thanks. If you change your mind and want one then DM me

And me, though to be fair, I was 10 hours late to the party.

So, let me get this right, he has the time to work on this, but BTC1 is no where near completed??
Shows what a colossal clusterfuck this whole fork is when the only developer is focusing on other things!

Someone sign me up for some of these cryptic substances pls!

This just seems pretty lame. I can think of better ways than wasting time, blue tacking print outs. Write a blog post, Tweet Jihan, etc. It's hardly constructive is it?
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:51:59
so childish! What exactly does petulant behaviour like this achieve? You guys should be embarrassed as this is so cringeworthy.
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:53:09
Just to clarify, I am not against all forms of protest. I just thought this particular one was a bit shit.
