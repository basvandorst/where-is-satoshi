Why does one need to report if you’re buying a service with bitcoin? If I went to overstock and bought a product, is it not treated as a currency then?

Is anyone concerned about the upcoming MtGOX  return of funds? I’m not sure what the total # of btc that’s being claimed by their original owners but I’d imagine many may sell which could have huge market impact / price collapse 
Thoughts ?

Never invest more than you’re willing to loose. Also, we are in a bubble so when it does crash, expect to hold for a few years and you’ll win in the end

On Coinbase, about 98% of volume is automated. Bots typically tag orders with their own order id into client_oid field.
I looked into what % of received messages in order book had that field populated and it was about 98%

Was there any catalyst in particular that triggered the bitcoin bubble in 2017? 
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:46:46


whats the tldr of what happened today?

Do you remember any in particular?
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:53:50
100% I’m actually thinking of making a video to explain how analogous lightning is to the internet. I think we are witnessing the development of the protocol stack for the “network of value”
For example, with internet we join network by obtaining public IP and then data can be routed through system in an efficient way.  Speed is governed by slowest network link between two parties
Blockchain is like layer 1 (broadcast network) where everyone hears everything. 
Lightning is layer 2 where someone joins network by creating a payment channel. Transaction capacity is governed by smallest channel between the two parties.
@_date: 2018-09-18 12:29:48
Can we get a lightning powered vending machine?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:51:46
Yes!! This is like when I first saw Steve jobs show off pinch and zoom on first iPhone 
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:20:17
Yep agreed with you on all points. Is there any way to know how much BTC is expected to be returned ?
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:13:14
I was curious if perhaps this was deliberately orchestrated by large players to generate a herd effect from retail folks.
Bitcoin was more or less in a channel for 2014, 2015, and 2016 until all of a sudden the price started creeping up and pushed over 1k. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:44:00
Indeed, and then bitmex ppl will try to short and down we go. Personally, I’m holding for next few years so I welcome the buying opportunity. Even if a recession was to start in US, crypto is here to stay and at worst the recovery time might just be extended 
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:07:15
I’m all for the tech, in fact I set up a lightning node this week in google cloud. I plan to always hold a % of my net worth in crypto but during a bubble, the price exponentially outpaces the fundamental value (e.g. check out Nic Carter realized cap based on utxo) and during these times, it’s only prudent to take profits

@_date: 2017-12-10 16:18:55
What if you post only in the buy and sell? Gdax has zero fees there, and at worse, the other exchange will have 0.25%
You can also use wire transfer which is typically $10 from exchange and is same day. There are bank accounts where this is free.

Also, one could short it
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:08:16

“Today we’re excited to announce the initial release of Lightning Loop, a non-custodial service that makes it easier for people to receive funds on Lightning. As we’ve watched the network and the number of Lightning applications grow over the past year, many users have told us they were interested in a solution to help with receiving on Lightning. We’ve also seen more and more use cases, from earning satoshis on microwork sites, to selling goods with Lightning, to sending peer-to-peer payments around the world, where the ability to receive is key. “

Yes, you should listen to podcast of flippening called tokenizing the world

For those with money in bitcoin, I think the vast majority bought it because others did during 2017 bull run  (herd effect). Even if they understand it’s future utility, the fear of loosing more can prompt many to sell along with bitmex short traders taking advantage and compounding the problem.
In the short term, I think it’s entirely possible for market correction / recession + mt gox refunds to extert downward pressure on all of crypto. It will be a great time to buy more, especially with how fast the tech is improving.

Because if exchanges or others discover evidence that exploit was used in past to double spend, this could be disastrous. Imagine someone found evidence that all the tether printing was artificial, and drove the increase in price in 2017. The credibility for crypto would be hit hard 
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:18:30
Likewise! I sold some too early, oh well.

I have a trading and core position. I don’t touch core. For trading, I experiment with multiple macro level signals to determine when things are oversold or overbought. I’m actually thinking of building a tool to help others understand when shit gets hot in the next bubble.
Today is a perfect example of a 2std dev move. The number of days that bitcoin moved 25% is just a handful (use pandas and jupyter notebook to do some quick analysis). While there is a strong fundamental reason for the move, historically the next day or two you will see a 10% drawdown or more
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:42:55
Is it crypto only?
@_date: 2019-10-16 22:07:20
What are you thoughts on a recession (long overdue) impact on bitcoin prices? We’re living in interesting times where the Fed is keeping repo rates in check, baby boomers retiring and withdrawing, pension liability increasing, negative interest rates, return of QE, aka organic purchases, etc
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:14:51
Sure but to get to the 0.15%, you need to trade 50k at higher initial levels. Just saying, it adds up and what upset me most is how they described it as a “slight increase”. Just be honest please and don’t sugar coat it
It’s also based on 30day trading volume! Who trades 50k a month here, let’s be honest, not many!
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:43:17
Agreed. At least be honest in the messaging

@_date: 2019-10-21 16:24:39
Between 2011 and now, one pattern I saw is when there are two consecutive large drops of SPY (-2%, -1.5%)...BTC 5day return was negative 80% of the time. No guarantee that a sustained downtrend in SPY will cause BTC to correlate, but it’s still a speculative asset by most people in the world. It will be interesting if this narrative starts to shift

@_date: 2019-10-26 01:14:32
False, it needs to move slow!! If you wanna see btc at 55k (1T mcap), you need it to rise gradually.
Mayer multiple is ur friend (heck I should’ve sold like 25% when Mayer breeched 2.4 recently and bought back when it was around 1)
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:12:21
This is a nice price point to short
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:46:31
It’s a good leading indicator to start taking profits 
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:22:32
I think it will correct 15-20% when Mayer multiple hits about 2,4 (12k)
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:38:12
How did you do this ? I want to do a Roth IRA into BTC
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:27:45
Yes, if it corrects now, it has time to get to 60k. Otherwise it may collapse and short sellers will push it down
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:45:52
Yes - stock to flow ratio + brand + simple design will keep it around for years

@_date: 2019-06-26 00:29:55
Current price / 200 day moving average. Google it, it basically shows the speed at which an asset goes up and historically when it hits 2.4+, it’s at risk of falling
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:36:01
Assuming this happens when say 20M BTC are mined, this puts BTC at a 20 trillion mcap

US will enter recession sooner or later. I’m more worried about this 
@_date: 2019-04-07 17:53:29
If central banks see it as a threat to monetary policy, yes. I could see central banks around the world colluding to 
1) require crypto exchanges in their respective jurisdictions to give your BTC to central banks in exchange for fiat
2) work with companies like chain analysis to determine who has how much BTC elsewhere and fine you if you don’t transfer that amount 
3) other measures that make it not worth it holding your BTC
Remember that BTC has a finite supply and if the world starts to hoard it like gold, 1933 can repeat 
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:30:24
At 60k it will be at 1 Trillion marketcap. That will be quite a resistance level 
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:27:05

@_date: 2018-11-22 02:57:47
US Recession will make this one way worse 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:10:53
I have a feeling that Bakkt will launch, people will expect price to move and when it doesn’t, ppl will sell and drive price down more.
What I think more likely will happen is on a random Tuesday in next few years, a low liquidity opportunity will present itself to a whale who will cause a green candle. Bots will take profits but other whales will join. As more whales join, more green candles will show up and a bull run will emerge.
People will google bitcoin and ethereum again to find out that the tech is getting better. People will buy. More importantly, most institutions don’t want to be first, but a very close second. 
Once bull run resumes, it will be a combination of retail flow and institutional flow trying to get btc using OTC and via smart order router algos (e.g. GS crypto desk) taking liquidity of US exchanges. I can see prices gradually rising quickly to 20k and then a slower climb to 60k followed by a euphoric phase to near 100k
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:30:47
I mean wow...it’s just massive panic selling 
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:10:17
It could get worse if there is recession...
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:41:33

@_date: 2019-01-20 23:38:24
I intend to keep this site up to date, so feel free to bookmark it. Alternatively, I run some basic code in python to calculate the Mayer multiple for any asset. If you PM me, I can share a juypter notebook with you with the code.
I also plan on making a more real website to help folks use metrics to determine when we are in euphoria phase of bubble (e.g. social media, coinbase on App Store, % of retail vs bot trades, etc)

Fantastic feedback! I actually heard 6 months back that China was interested in having a national crypto currency so they have full visibility into the money flow and can easily sanction those against the nation (e.g. freeze or takeover their wallets), but this will only drive the demand for bitcoin or other decentralized currencies as you say

Most likely, people will exit crypto because it’s speculative which will create a snowball effect. People will exit, causing prices to fall followed by more exiting and more falling prices.
This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Bitcoin fundamentals are strong today and lightning network along with future stack dev will anchor bitcoin. It will just take longer to recover

Crypto assets are speculative and thus anyone who invests into them are thus speculators.

I really like the mayer multiple because it gives me a sense of when the price of bitcoin is multiple standard deviations away from its normal. I made a website to plot this for other coins. I find it most interesting for coins like ETH, LTC, and XLM because they have been around for the past few years.

What are your thoughts on the possibility of a country such as the US or China releasing their own programmable cryptocurrency that is controlled by them and is compatible with the upper layer stack that’s being built now (e.g. lightning)? 
A gov such as China could even enforce all transactions to be done on their cryptocurrency and nationalize all miners to only mine their coin (requiring a fork for bitcoin). The US gov can force their citizens to forfeit their non-gov coins much like what happened with gold in the 1930’s
This paints a dire picture for decentralized non-gov backed coins, but is this something that could potentially happen?

“A recent report into crypto energy use, done by Coinshares, which is the only honest, data-driven report ever to be undertaken[4], concludes that almost half of global bitcoin mining takes place in Sichuan. 
Overall, they estimate that 77.6% of global bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy. My former colleagues in Hong Kong and I think that the real amount is closer to 85% and rising. This is mainly concentrated in cooler climates with abundant, and underutilized, hydro power, including: Quebec, Iceland, and the Pacific North-West.[5]”

Making bold announcements could have been deliberate to ensure they get the funding. I’m growing concerned by bakkts actions, and i question if their entrance will help in long run.
They are an exchange at the end of the day and make money on fees. Starbucks can just be another avenue for them to route order flow to their system to collect fees. My worry is what they could dream up next (think margin lending, fractional reserves, etc)

True, I’m excited that we’re witnessing the development of the protocol stack for value. Internet has the OSI model, can’t wait to see what crypto’s version will be.
I actually made a video on comparing the internet to crypto - 
I can’t wait to see what the future layers of stack will be (e.g. confidential transactions, interoperability between blockchain, etc)

Bitcoin is like the transistor. It unlocks what was once impossible and will move society forward.
The technology will introduce a new way for value, and more importantly, trust to be transferred between anyone across the world. The future is bright

Wow...just read your post and it’s so eerily accurate! 
Given we are in a bear market now, when would you say the next bubble would be and how high do you think it will go? I’m currently writing some code to implement  in prep for this

What you’re describing is making a forecast in the quant world. Look into book pressure / trade pressure models. Perhaps start with enigma catalyst and do some back testing there.
You can ether 1) use purely market data, 2) news/event data 3) some mix
You can also consider a market making or arb strategy, but you need speed here

Can someone query the gdax trades around that time to see if a whale placed a large order that chewed through the order book (as oppose to stop loss triggers or something else)?

Confluence of events - 1) catalyst for btc rise was a 100M buy order at a time of lowest liquidity on 4/2 
2) blockchain week
3) China could devalue yuan causing flight to btc
4) herd effect
3, I find the most interesting because Greece had 10M people when they had a crisis and caused a btc runup. China has 1.6B people

What minimum marketcap is needed for BTC to be at so that it’s volatility is similar to government currencies?
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:43:45
If current price / 200day moving average&gt; backtested large standard deviation, sell
Look into Mayer multiple. This could be applied to many crypto’s and is a logical way to think about when things go parabolic. Other signals include your Uber driver and random friend asking you if it’s a good time to buy into this bitcoin thing 
I’m planning on making a website this weekend to let anyone quickly see the Mayer multiple for top 100 crypto’s

lol nope! But once lightning network matures and adoption grows, many will take notice

Fair point :) I’ll try raspberry pi next 
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:51:21
Yes, it’s essentially a must if you want to pay with lightning from mobile phones.
The journey of getting it to work and understanding how it works under the covers is much more rewarding than the result itself.

Connecting zap was a bit tricky in that you needed to properly generate the certificate. I have the command line I used to do so which I can share.
My node is indeed on mainnet so open internet. I don’t have much $ in it so if there is ever a vulnerability, I’m okay with that

It will be interesting to see how recession affects crypto. 
Logically, people will pull money out of crypto because it’s a speculative asset but there is a small chance that if a rally occurs due to Bakkt or just bots trading up due to technicals, some retail folks may take notice and buy some crypto. This could compound into a bigger rally. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:15:11
60k because this will be about 1 trillion mcap and I expect ppl to sell at big round

For those interested in doing the same, you can follow the tutorials below. I did it in google cloud because you get $300 of free credit (\~6 months of usage)
1. Google Cloud Tutorial - [ (remember to open port in google fw + host forewall iptables for zap)
2. Download Zap IOS - [ (they have alpha which you get using test flight on iOS)
3. Follow end of Zap tutorial - [ Alternatively, you can follow this full tutorial and do it in digital ocean
The hardest part was getting the certificate working, but feel free to PM me if you have issues.

Correct, sell the rally in bear...come on mini rally due to something good please?
