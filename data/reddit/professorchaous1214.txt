Ya that is about right. My portfolio of alts just got bitch slapped today... total KO

If BTC price goes up from 10k to 20k would 1 Doge still equal 1 Doge? ��
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:51:28
I stand corrected for assuming. Tip my hat to you for being in since 2013. I only got in around 2015. You got more war wounds than me ;)

Isn’t bread wallet on an app that is connected to an account like your Apple account? If you change phones, how do you download the bread app without an account?

I get it ;) I would be excited too

People forget market cycles. Last time this happened everyone went into bit and lost out on some nice cheap entries into alts. Then they fomo’d back in as alts move up fast. It will happen again. Best to sit tight and hold your alt bags. Don’t chase bit and then jump to alts as they start moving up... you will get burned.

Apparently there is a gold meteor headed our way and it will make gold worthless and bitcoin king... but it’s gonna destroy the earth too... soo ya. Cheers to Armageddon.

@_date: 2019-07-04 00:51:16
It’s not. I dollar cost average... so this is a great price if you continue to buy and average through bull/bear cycles. But your question was what was the best price to buy at lately... $3500 was it.

Only veterans own BTC and hold it to the end. 
Since you owned Alts to start, I’m guessing you may have joined the crypto community in 2017 or more recently. 
Be warned of Alt Season...
If alt season hits and BTC doesn’t move for a month.... you will be tempted with sick gains and shills with all the alts... 
Just promise you won’t panic sell and jump back into alts. 
BTC is always king but it’s fun to bet on the knight that defeats the Queen and gets close to the king.  You will miss it and I give you until alt season (if it ever happens).

It’s crazy that people who have a coinbase account thought they could get away without paying taxes, especially when coinbase sent the IRS the same trade information used for tax filing. People had to see this coming.

Ohh pearl.. had big hopes for them before Bruno did his thing... opacity won’t make it :-/ Also, everyone figured out Dragonchain is not Disney’s blockchain. Keeping my fingers crossed iota and ada make it this time again. Would hate to see them become the next feathercoin ��

Lots of people buying crypto with credit cards... I’m sure adding debt and that increased borrowing doesn’t help the situation.

You giving up on litecoin? Why not ask for LTC to replace the ones you lost?

Game over mate. Get your things off the ledger as your keys are compromised. Layers removes the emoji and it’s bright as day. Hopefully you moved the funds by now.

Everything running too hot today. Needs to cool down for next leg up. Imagine being the newbie who bought at $13700 and is now freaking out since they can’t panic sell as it drops to $12k and all you see is “scheduled maintenance” or the “system is unavailable.” ... it should just say “welcome to crypto.. we are doing you a favor.”

You can hold on an exchange, but you run the risk of losing all of it since you were afraid to spend $5. You need to weigh the risk in this situation and in my mind you are more worried about a fee when you run the risk of losing it all..(not your keys, not your BTC).

Does it tell you what alts to buy for next alt run ��

I was hoping it would go into orbit allowing us to mine it and tank prices. I want to be around vs having a meteor hit us and wipe us out.

I stand corrected. Well I hope it doesn’t smash into us ;)

Stop looking at your portfolio upside down ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:09:47
Months vs a year in your charts and you forget that barely anyone knew what BTC or crypto was in 2014. So much activity on horizon with fidelity and bakkt and real world adoption with google, ibm, Walmart partnering with crypto companies. I don’t know if we are back in a bear market as history doesn’t repeat itself and the entire atmosphere and visibility of crypto is different. Anyone buying should buy with caution as it’s a risky bet, but I only expect a 30% pullback before we continue onward and upward. Don’t miss out on alt season :) p.s. I’m not a financial advisor just a guy that owns a slice of the top 1000 coins..

@_date: 2019-06-20 18:18:46
I agree with you. It’s not what satoshi had in mind. It sucks, but it is hard to avoid with BTC gaining value and moving to mainstream adoption. Governments get involved...
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:16:42
If you have been in bitcoin since 2012 and actually own a reasonable amount of bitcoins...then you are in a better place than 80% of people here. 
Worrying about the regulation is understandable, but then again you don’t have to worry about financial issues like most people - assuming you held onto most of your BTCs, I’m assuming you are more well off than the rest of us. 
Hope a new company starts up to meet this demand for people like you. But you are in the minority group for this request. Good luck.

Welcome to the worst addiction you could probably have .... just wait until you get side tracked by alt coins.. buy on margin and short the market.. get rekt.. or get locked out of your account.. send crypto to the wrong address.. miss a token swap.. ask about airdrops... learn about staking... and then get pulled back into just buying bitcoin in the end.. have fun :)

No. Just don’t want to see it break down to below $6500.  More bullish signs if it breaks up.

Celsius isn’t bad ... get a lil return for holding your bitcoin. The catch is that it is held in bitpay’s cold storage. But you don’t own your keys, so you can get a % of return holding in there, but you also don’t have it safe in your wallet. If you hold on an exchange, then holding it here is better. If you want it safe and you want to own it, the get a cold storage wallet and wait for the price to go up for a return.

You can start trading on CB within hours. But to transfer it off you sometimes have to wait.  Also if you using checking account it will take time. Credit cards were instant.
