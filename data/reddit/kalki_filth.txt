Hey, I'm not a troll I promise, just a longtime BTC enthusiast trying to understand what is going on. I understand that the fee's for Bitcoin are now quite high, and that this is something that Bitcoin Unlimited was claiming they could solve. I also understand that BU was recently hit with an attack that showed that their code is not secure, and is in fact quite vulnerable. What I would like to know is, what is the solution for the high fees that does not involve a fork and a change to the code? I heard someone mention "segwit" is this something that will help with this issue? Thanks

When I try to add my wishlist, I get an error though. Should have mentioned that. I will happily use your referral link! Can't get it to add my wishlist, however

I think it's the same for Canadians because I had no problems with the instructions, but when I go to "name your discount" and paste in my wishlist it says that there was a problem importing my wishlist. I'm gonna contact purse.io support, and if I can get it working I will use your referral link for sure
