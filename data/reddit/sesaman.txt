One and half months of holding an asset isn't a long time, and if you think otherwise you're really impatient. Remember the saying that the market takes from the impatient and gives to the patient.

What makes Bitcoin inherently better than alts? What differentiates Bitcoin from shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:13:13
There are better cryptos for those purposes. I'm also probably now on a list.

If these are your reasons, Bitcoin, which is the oldest, slowest, most expensive to use and hardest to update isn't the currency to invest in.

Once the price stabilizes Bitcoin is dead. The only reasons now to buy it is speculation on the value (=hoping for insane profits with no effort) and to buy alt-coins that have no fiat currency pair. Once more practical currency pairs for alts become the norm, that use case is gone, and once price stabilizes, there will be no more speculators on the value.
I mean it might then become a store of value... for some reason... but it doesn't look too good.

This is the wrong sub to ask this question. Go to and first research different cryptos yourself. Don't buy into the hype and see what makes the most sense to you now, in short term and in long term. What are the differences in the capabilities of each and how do the technologies compare. Are other cryptos more than just a currency, or do they have features other cryptos don't.
Then read what other people are saying when you're more knowledgeable about the subject.
My personal opinion is that if more people actually did this, Bitcoin would be nowhere near as popular as it's now.

Honest question: I get the people who want to make money with Bitcoin, but I don't get the people who invest in Bitcoin because they believe in the technology. There are better options on the market technology-wise, with more features, lower fees and faster transaction times. Why would anybody who has looked into multiple cryptocurrencies invest in Bitcoin if he's a supporter of blockchain?

What are your opinions of LN centralizing Bitcoin?

When you assume, you make an ass out of u and me.
I'm saying that there are fundamentally better cryptos, and even if those don't take off, we might have something completely new in five years that dethrones everything we know today.
