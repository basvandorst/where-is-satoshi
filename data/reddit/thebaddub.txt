Businessweek and CNN (grain of salt taken) reporting a 5.8% dip in response to the news. I'm sure that's not the only instigator, but it is the biggest player in the US bitcoin sphere.
I only keep an eye Mt Gox numbers as a ceiling indicator as we all know that price is inflated. Coinbase, CoinDesk and the 24 hour weighed price are all better indicators for US holders.
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:49:06
It's down about $50 ($820-&gt;$770) at Coinbase since yesterday.

Too big to fail...Gox failed. It's not a bank, it's a currency exchange. Big difference.
Also, FDIC only insures $250k. If you had more than that SOL.

I'm saying that **mtgox is not a bank**, that banks fail (but the phrase "too big to fail" is a federal view of some financial institutions) and that if a bank fails the FDIC does not cover all of your account so there is potential for loss.
All in all you're comparing apples and oranges. Gox is an exchange, not a bank. Bitcoin is not regulated and state issued currency, for the most part, is. BUT banks and exchanges can and do fail.
I'm not a BTC day trader. I'm long regardless of the recent news because I took the steps to secure my holdings, not leave them in a foreign exchange account.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:55:44
I didn't intend to imply it was a crash, however $50 dip is on the larger side of recent slips (January) over a 24 hour period. This news definitely has/had some influence on the price today.
If you can watch a 40-50% post-Thanksgiving crash and those in early 2013 or before, this is just a knee jerk reaction on a relatively small scale. Now Friday/Saturday will be a different beast.

I'm not OP and I didn't buy at 900 but to answer your question..the price was rising double digit percentages every single day for a few weeks. There was no end in sight at $200, $300, $400, $500, $600, $700...
I saw the price rise from $675 to $850 in an hour. China reached 6888CNY ($1130) before Gox had 900USD. It very well could have tipped $1k. I then watched it plummet $200 in twenty minutes.
OP decided to take the plunge in the frenzy and got bit. I bought some more on the down slope in the high $600 after Coinbase/Bitstamp came back online. I figured we'd bump back up on a 22% swing. I was wrong...for that day. I think we'll see $700 within the next 4 weeks.

I considered mining back at the beginning of the year but the delay on any machine curbed my enthusiasm. I occasionally checked the status of BTC until it reached about $175...then I got serious about it. 
If I had 11btc, I might consider spending some however my feet are just getting wet in the single digits. I don't anticipate a huge burst in the near future, although it might be welcomed, I do anticipate cost averaging over the next few months in order to build my wallets up.
Good luck to you if you are indeed enterprising. I feel that btc definitely has the potential to be life changing (for the better).

If you didn't buy when they had a disclaimer of "we reached out daily buy limit" and had to acknowledge that you may be buying at a different rate (extra check box) then you should be price locked into what they quoted. If not, they won't over charge you but will give you X amount of BTC for the USD you bought.
For example if the price goes up to 1BTC for what you paid, then you'd get 1BTC instead of 1.6. 
I think you're fine and price locked.

Bitcoin is not the Dow Jones if you haven't noticed. A 30% dip means a 30% discount on bitcoins.
There's always profit taking and panic selling followed by a gobbling up of all those new "cheaper" coins. You can't stay at an all time high forever.
Welcome to the roller coaster.

I don't believe you can cancel through Coinbase if they locked in your price...possibly through your bank but Coinbase might IP ban your account as fraud if you do it.
If they allow you to cancel through Coinbase, by all means you should if you don't like the variable price.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:30:24
I think we're currently seeing some hesitation to peak $900 and eventually $1000. It's a mental blockade that people put up given a specific number. We see the same thing in China when it peaked around 6888CNY.
Once it breaks that mental barrier, $900 being the current mental ceiling, it will resume steady growth. Give it a month or two and I have no doubt that we'll see $1000/btc, or 1mBTC = $1USD.

Obviously the government (dhs/fbi/secret service), as they've mentioned, focus primarily on the criminal aspects of this new technology. That's their job. They do sound optimistic about BTC and are not denying the legal utilization of it.  This whole hearing is a discovery period for the USG, not a death sentence.

That's a nice idea. I was just thinking if I were handed a paper wallet like that and I had no idea what bitcoin was, I might eventually throw it out or just not know what's what (public/private key, qr code, balance etc). The simpler the design, the better reception IMO.

Many people, new to btc, bought in at the 300-500 range and saw it climb to 600,700,800 &amp; peak at 900. I think the sub-100s began cashing out which resulted in the 100-200$ holders to panic sell (along with many weak stomachs). They made great returns and would be idiotic not to realize them at 700%+. 
The price seems to have stabilized at the mid $500 range after sinking to low $400s. If you think the crash has more to go then a lot more people need to jump out at even or take a loss. I don't think that'll happen. They haven't "lost" much, if at all, and can ride out this climb/fall.
If anything it might sink to the $400s again before it slowly starts to rise again at the September rate. More realistically, the market is about to get a new influx of buyers who are just hearing and (learning about BTC through mass media legitimized by the Senate hearings). New blood brings a new frenzy.
TLDR Prediction:
$420 is the new floor. Be prepared to see the $700s again within 2-4 weeks. More growth in the upcoming year.

What do you mean when you say they were "out of coins?" Do you mean that you checked a box that said you would pay a different rate as of Friday 11/22?
If so, my understanding is that you were not locked in at a price and they will allow you to cancel your order through coinbase anytime before Friday. If you do not cancel, they will apply your $859 to the rate on Friday, e.g. if BTC is $859 on Friday, you'll get 1BTC - not 1.6.
If not (you didn't click a check box acknowledging a different rate) then you will be price locked. Your bank account won't be debited for a few days and you won't get your coins for up to 5-7 business days, but you WILL get 1.6btc at the rate you paid. You will not be allowed to cancel your transition through coinbase.
