Where is that youtube video of cherry pick guy?

Yea, most people I know personally that are into crypto and shy introverted nerds.  Mostly programmers or IT guys or just typically computer geeks.  Not the type of guys that like to stand out or be flashy.

In reality, these flashy guys are probably &lt; 1% of crypto holders.  Most guys are probably geeky nerds sitting in front of their computer switch out of WoW to check prices.  Or programmers or IT nerds.
Most people I know that were "really into" crypto before 2016, have really stopped talking about.  If you own a lot of money in bitcoin, it's not great to be wearing a bitcoin shirt and gold bitcoin neckless.

yea, it's weird.  All these people are saying he would have $25M today.
But could anyone really hold that long ?
working shit job, in debit, but have $25M locked away in crypto.
I think most people would sell when it hit $100K or $1M or $10M or slowly take some off during price spikes.  
Even $50K can be live changing amount of money for some people (if it means them getting out of debt or having some security).  You can't retire on it, but if you gave most people a chance to cash out at $10K or $50K, I think they would, or at least partially.

also check the hover over.   I think you can fake it like this :
edit: hover over and you can see it'll take you to some bad place other than google like you would assume.  Not sure why reddit allows this.

What kind of logic is this, lol.
"altocins is against the rules in" go talk about it some place else!
"omg, they are talking about altcoins in another sub!  Let's start a post on talking about how they are talking about altcoins !"
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:30:25


Correct, but they could trade USDT for any crypto of their choice and then cash out of that coin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:16:00
short positions are obviously allowed in cash settled products.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:04:45
yea, it's back down.  Still isn't great, but a lot better than before.  Now it's  50K unconfirmed at $9 fee:

1) relaying on good nature of third party is shitty.  This is a decentralized trust-less system were we have to assume other market players have their own incentives (or down right malice).  That is the **entire** point of bitcoin.  We assume everyone else is a bad player so should **never** relay on their cooperation.
2) 2018 is too late.  We've been working on segwit/LN for 5+ years.  **The time is now.  We need to put up or shutup.**  This is what will separate the boys from men my friend.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:36:51
dude, you used 2 day chart.   So misleading FUD.  Look at 1 week chart: 
it's not as bad if you look at it that way.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:20:07


bitcoin cash is apparently doing it.  They have no transactions backlog and fees are low.  It's better than bitcoin right now and only took them &lt; 6 months.

"We want the security and transparency of a decentralized blockchian, without it being decentralized or transparent.  Oh and when we said security, we meant that it needs to be mutable for contract adjustments."
uh, so you want a database
"Yea, make it more blockchain-ish though.  Investors love hearing that we're blockchain-ish"
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:25:13
cool story bro, you also said Bitcoin Cash would be $0 within 48 hours of fork.  You also said you sold all your BCH for BTC after fork....
How is that working out for you ? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:32:25


True, but with price arbitrator bots, that price is easily spread across all exchanges until it levels out.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:49:45
I go on local bitcoins and buy $600M worth of bitcoins using paper money.  The price goes up due to this "demand".
The people at local bitcoins find out I was using counterfeit dollar bills.  Ops.
I still have bitcoins.  Those guys have worthless money they can't use.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:53:00


link?  I don't see this market listed.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:06:31


That would be awesome.  
Segwit/LN has been in the works for 5+ years now.  But we need fee reduction *now*, we need transaction speed *now*.  Bitcoin cash is capitalizing on that and stealing our thunder..  We can't wait, we need to beat them at their own game.
It needs to happen now.  I can't stress that enough.  We've been doing this for 5 years and they come around in &lt; 6 months and offer a short term solution to steal market share.
**It's fun to brag about LN and other things, but here is where the rubber meets the road.  Put up or shut up time boys.**  
Get it working.  Make LN great.  The time is *now*.  I don't mean by end of year, I don't mean a month from now.  This needs to happen in next few days.

ok, they created that sub so they could talk about a larger topics in the bitcoin space, one of which is the bitcoin cash fork. (other topics, like bitcoin gold, 1x, 2x and other coins are *also* allowed).
That is the entire point of that sub, since it's not allowed here.  Don't want it here?  Fine, that is a reasonable rule, so they took discussion over to forum where it's allowed and now you are whining about it.
Are you going to go in and talk about how dogcoin discussions should be allowed since it's a altcoin based on litecoin ?

"cash settlement"
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:35:55
It depends on their market function.  If CME is doing futures, then options will be soon to come (cme loves options) and can just do basic delta/greek hedging.  
But even without that, they have been making markets in single contracts for hundreds of years now... it's not best way to do it, but it can work (especially in a high vol product like bitcoin):
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:03:23
What is your plan to re balance ? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:12:09
with leverage and loans you could get that up to 150% bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:25:43
They haven't posted them yet.  It's generally assumed though 1 contract = 1 bitcoin with $10 point (ie, price increment).  purely cash settled on date.  
Some margin, but they are probably going to limit positions to start with to about 50K contract/investor.
Tis is all just rumor though, obviously they could change it.  They want to standardize with "industry convenient"

In the USA, the IRS and says it's property  for tax purposes and the CFTC says it's a commodity for trading purposes.  The SEC is debating it, they have said things like *certain* ICOs can be defined as securities, but they haven't made statement on bitcoin (other than they think it's a commodity and falls outside their jurisdiction).
Also that is just bitcoin, like I hinted at above, ICOs or other coins might be a entire different ball game.

"cash settled"
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:00:12
the theory is that once ETF hits then price will sky rocket.  If that is true, then you won't be able to get in on ground floor like you can now
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:15:54
"cash settled"
no bitcoins are involved.  You are basically betting on *price* (either up by buying or down by selling).
