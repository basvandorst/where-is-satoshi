It really depends. If you use term deposits, in my country at least you can expect 3% interest currently. If you've got around 2 million, that's around $60,000 a year in interest. That's more than enough for most people to live comfortably. At 10 million, I wouldn't even care too much about interest since I'd never spend all that money. 
$60K would be less than what I am earning right now to be fair, but if I were given the option to not have to work and have 2 million in the bank with a steady 3% interest on it every year, you can bet I'd take it up in a heartbeat.
Alternatively, if you're looking for better returns, stocks will probably do a lot better than 3% so you'd need less money to get the same return. It all really depends on how extravagant your lifestyle is. I live rather simply so I save a big percentage of my paycheck as it is so if I earned less from interest, I wouldn't be too concerned as it would be unlikely to affect my lifestyle.

I too have been thinking of buying bitcoin ever since it was worth a couple hundred dollars, and here I am with it worth $10,000 and still haven't bought it. *Shakes my head in shear disappointment with myself*.

Yeah, GMT/UTC time would be preferred for anything international. I know my timezone so if you say 10am GMT 2, it's quicker for me to do the conversion than trying to convert from a local timezone, especially since some places have daylight savings and you're not sure if it's in effect etc.
