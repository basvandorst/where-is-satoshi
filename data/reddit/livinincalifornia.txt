Thanks Bitfinex for severely diminishing trust in exchanges while highlighting your lack of true security in the event of a hack.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:09:11
This has motivated me to move all my coins to my Trezor. Can't trust these exchanges with security until they mature.

What frustrates me the most is that certain people have tried to draw parallels between Ethereum's hardfork and a potential Bitcoin hardfork to raise the block limit and say "all hard forks are inherently dangerous" but provide little risk analysis and a reluctance to accept any proposals to do so which mitigate risks within an acceptable tolerance.

Short answer: yes. Long answer: yes.

Why prop up failing mining businesses if they are no longer profitable? It's a central planning perspective that tries to keep a failing business afloat. You must have failures in a free market, otherwise it's manipulated and prone to major problems (see: current central bank policy).

I think 15kb is reasonable, although I'm worried about those on 56k being unable to run a node and the possibility of centralization due to miners not having ISDN connections to support the extra load.

Why should Bitcoin become increasingly complex in response to scalability rather than increasing capacity in the slightest?
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:16:33
It's embedded in a .dll file disguised as a driver and uses 'Get.privkey' to search it's relational database for keys stored on the system.
It then stores it on Microsoft's cloud servers for safe keeping along with your other "anonymous" user data that they collect.
Obviously I'm joking, somewhat..

Which suggestion? Have we not tried to be reasonable with the mods here?

Absolutely. Especially when Internet connections even in homes exceed 100Mbit in many places around the world, we're concerned more about Chinese miners not having enough bandwidth.... that's a special interest, and a POOR political move

Maybe if google gets its act together that may happen
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:33:21
Of course, but if you have an artificially low ceiling for transactions relative to the transaction rate to induce a "fee market", that's a political move, not one that's was inherent from the project's beginnings.

@_date: 2015-12-30 00:19:17
Segwit is an optimization and not a solution to full blocks.  
Core seems to have no problem throwing the network and it's users into unknown territory through inaction on this critical issue, while shifting priorities to preparing Bitcoin to become a settlement network and limited in order to make their Lightning network profitable.
@_date: 2015-12-05 18:39:32
The US absolutely cannot handle higher rates. Wages are down, GDP is growing 1% YOY, services and manufacturing are down, transportation and energy companies are about to start defaulting on their loans already.
Remember there is more debt and a larger housing bubble than in 2008. Nothing has changed in that respect, so fundamentally, we're headed for a HUGE "correction" in equities, likely 40-50% down.
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:02:07

Scale Bitcoin to mass adoption or scale "Sidechains" to mass adoption?
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:19:47
I think the idea of a private ledger is hilarious.  Closed source software? Doesn't make sense in a blockchain project.
The basis of any money is trust. Through a decentralized open source model, the trust is in the algorithms which are visible to all with a ledger viewable by all and which should be accessible by all, and not hidden by those who wish to use them to extract enormous wealth for a ever increasing minority.
The backers of these projects are seeking gains through manipulation of all aspects of the Bitcoin blockchain and software, however their inferior interpretations will fail as they would rely on either trust in a secretive central authority or on fiat script. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 23:45:24
If they are paying an appropriate fee, yes. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 02:48:28
It would be interesting to see how government's would react if Bitcoin were truly anonymous at the protocol level. I imagine, not very well.
Let other services take that role, so it doesn't cause backlash against the entire currency.

Just wait until the next bubble coming up around 2016
@_date: 2015-06-13 18:52:51
Can you help explain technically how the lightning network would not increase centralization and require trust beyond the protocol?
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:06:18
It's still a special interest. It's not in everyone's best interest to make special consideration for 1 group based on the fact that they are currently the majority. That could change. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:25:19
Or why we're more concerned with Chinese miners over the reliability of the network long term?

Sure, the BRICS bank wants to do this, Bitcoin might also help accelerate a USD retreat, one that began at the end of Bretton Woods in the 70s. 
The fiqt currency system and our economy hang in the balance. The only thing helping is the rest of the world is just as bad if not worse off for considering USD to be a gold equivalent.

I think the price is about to rebound if not in the next month, thee next few months. That's just my opinion though, don't take it as advice.

That second comment though.
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:12:43
The core devs will be obsolete if they fail to properly update to support the network. 
A hard fork such as Bitcoin XT will replace it, or at least force them to raise it once they begin to lose their userbase. 
All in all, the Bitcoin block chain will remain intact so it's not the end of the world.

X-Post from @_date: 2015-06-08 20:09:40
Mmmm. Log graphs. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:36:48
All of the reasons they say a blocksize increase via a hard fork are issues, apply to NOT raising the limit as well.
1. Changes to behavior of the protocol under a "sustained full block" event have never been tested. Short term spam aside, we've never seen a 3GB mempool either. 
2. Changes required by actors - wallets have already had to make changes due to full blocks! Creating some rapidly.fluctuating fee market is not going to be easy to deal with for lightweight apps. 
3. Other problems - centralization, reliance on 3rd party verifiers, delayed confirmation times, are not just "game theory" or any other theories, it's arithmetic. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 01:18:01
The gold market is all paper these days anyway.
There is no where NEAR the amount of physical gold that is held on paper and in the markets. That's why a distributed ledger is the answer and not a trillion pieces of gold as the next generation of money.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:21:18
Thats also given the current system is a leech upon the world using debt instruments. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:19:31
If we're going to go back to trusting 3rd party clearing entities and get rid of the token, we'll have the equivalent of a shared google spreadsheet with central locks and keys. The token is what makes the whole system work.  
@_date: 2015-06-20 04:27:38
All in all it's true, however for the sake of a store of value, fiat currency has never served as that, and so it's not designed to become more restrictive as debt levels rise above what's psychologically considered normal. It's served as a means of exchange, with many strings attached and false corrupt institutions behind it. A distributed ledger is key to removing ownership over the money creation allowing certain realities of the present to become obsolete in the future. There is a museum dedicated to failed currencies. Bitcoin is unique because it's price relative to USD is all based on psychology. The USD currency system is losing trust and that's what drives it's unique ability to resist inflation. Once that falls away or there is a war, we will be left with what holds the most value. A unit of exchange that cannot be manipulated by panicking central bankers. Bitcoin is just a name of the token that drives the new matrix within the matrix. Or, much like a giant excel script virus that shuts down the current bankers books and closes them for all remaining history.

What it does show is that the $ is a terrible way of storing value and wealth, whereas Bitcoin has unique properties that make it the opposite.
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:04:23
Every single fiat currency is designed to be debased, or essentially made less and less valuable through a hidden tax called inflation. Government's use this to trade bonds with the corrupt inflationary central banks to justify expanding their money coining power to spend. National debt is made up of government debt, it's all debt, and it's never repayable in the end. It always ends up failing resulting in suffering, and eventual collapse of the system under the weight of the inflation and interest and lack of confidence in the ability to repay massive debts relative to GDP.
All in all, the system is designed to control, enslave, and submit the population to a world of it's creators intention.
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:06:40
This doesn't necessarily indicate the actual distribution of the coins. I think it's because many exchanges are managing large storage accounts but have many users with small balances that aren't shown here. I doubt it's just a few individuals who have that large number and also, many original coins are forever lost as people werent careful and lost their keys.
@_date: 2015-12-12 18:42:51
Yeah, totally, Bitcoin was intended to be exclusively for those who can afford it. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 01:13:17
Paging for an answer. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:17:38
Wouldn't that be a whole new coin altogether though? If Bitcoin becomes worth much more than what it is now, what motivation would there be to switch to a different coin for the average user?

@_date: 2014-01-02 18:15:36
That's exactly right. What I see happening is that bitcoin will crash once it becomes known that it can easily be tracked and manipulated by the NSA and other agencies, and then the IMF/WB will come out and say that we need a 'regulated' crypto-currency system and implement their own version, backed by all the major governments and corporations, and WHAMO, we're back to where we started.

I appreciate you explaining it this way. I think I'm understanding it better now. The last part I don't get is how the miners could choose to reject a change? Don't they just log into a mining pool and the network handles the rest? How do individual miners control the changes, and if mining becomes more centralized as it has been recently (not saying that will happen, just theoretically) would it be possible for the big players to collude with one another?
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:34:01

Cash should represent the store of value of labor over time, as it's what we receive in return. In its current form it always asks more than we can give since debts always accumulate in fiat systems or even gold backed ones. Some entity always wants the value of what someone can produce PLUS additional value through interest (usually through increased productivity) requiring a fast moving debt supply to see large gains in short periods. Our finance system, in the way it currently operates is relatively new but based on something very old, central power and control over money printing and the corruption thereof.
Bitcoin releases us from this paradigm by creating value with no strings attached, and reversing the failed system of debt slavery.

While it might be near impossible for a single person to do so, it isn't out of the question that a group, or pool (ie Ghash) could resurface and pose another risk to the network. 
Is there no improvement that can be made to the protocol or implementations to prevent this? The public doesn't trust banks, but at least the government's regulate them (somewhat). Without reassuring people that 1 entity could not take full control over the network, it will be hard to say that Bitcoin will prevail over other digital currencies.

It seems that the wealthy, old money elites represented by R3 and RAND (in their latest report) are realizing how difficult it will be to compete with Bitcoin using a "private blockchain", so they want the government to "make efforts" to reduce Bitcoin's impact by continuing to attack encryption and privacy.

They can regulate USD -&gt; BTC exchanges, and maybe they should. But the extent to which Bitcoin becomes a profit maker will determine whether it stays legit, or becomes a fractional reserve bank.

I've thought about this for awhile, and really, it's not going to be a huge problem. The blockchain itself will still be there, just not as accessible, which is fine, because it will no doubt maintain it's value if not gain value due to it's continued exponential log phase.

I hope I'm wrong
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:44:26
There can be both. As long as they can prove that they have what they say they have, and they aren't just printing IOUs. 
That's the whole problem with fiat, is that people want to make money quick and it's easy when you can generate your own dollars by becoming a fractional reserve bank, rather than having the unit of exchange be distributed to an open marketplace through the miners, properly representing the value of the time, labor, energy and material. That's the basis.

Just like the people who want to attribute any one event as the reason why the price Rises. The price Rises because it rises because there's demand and there's limited Supply, that's just the way it works, doesn't matter how many Bitcoin ATMs are how many firms are are the price does not seem to really depend on anything other than the technical fundamentals of supply and demand, and as the demand continues to grow the price will accelerate and it will cause higher highs and higher lows however it does not impact the long-term price outlook as long as current levels of activity are maintained or grow.

Except that many countries around the world rely so heavily on oil exports to balance their governments budgets, that any reduction in output will cause them to become even further in debt.
They will only cut production once the debt defaults begin. Iran just announced its going to start selling oil to Europe at a discount, further escalating the price war and adding millions of barrels a day to the glut.
It's going to be a long time before oil prices recover considering how many companies must pay their debt and are obligated to pump just to pay the interest on those debts.

1925-1929, that was the Federal Reserve's first power play after taking over the US monetary system at the turn of the century. By inflating a massive financial bubble through their power over the printing presses, and as the public drank the "kool-aid" and enjoyed record profits, they were able to orchestrate, what they knew would be a systemic fiat collapse, resulting in a massive wealth distribution to the top...those who owned real assets and gold, not paper. This required the "new deal" etc, but the damage had been done.
They shuttered so many small community banks through this process, and made the entire country dependent on the concentrated wealth of Wall St. in order to concentrate power among the few, as the power elite have always done at various times throughout history.
Many "founding fathers" of the US warned against central banks.

Blockstream must provide returns to their investors, right now they have no products making revenue.
Lightning network relies on a small blocksize to be marketable. Blockstream and it's Core affiliates must keep Bitcoin limited to make the Lightning network profitable and avoid a class action lawsuit.
If it becomes clear the Bitcoin network can scale successfully to 2MB and beyond without issues, LN may become irrelevant.

Luke, I feel that you are truly an intellgent computer scientist, however I can't understand why you can't see the major political and economic policy mishap that has occured here within the Core organization and its affiliates. 
Instead of reaching a compromise on the block size over the last year,, likely what is now to occur is stagnation, as countering forces and the manufactured dynamic of Core vs. BU, XT etc.is resulting in a stalemate. 
Unless LN is launched soon and actually lowers fees and reduces conf times, Bitcoin will lose market share to alt-coins. Not necessarily a bad thing, unless you believe Bitcoin should be a widely accessible currency to everyone in the world, not access limited to those who can afford relatively high fees priced in their national currency. 
All along I thought the intention was to build a scalable on-chain network that is also a dynamically scalable system, despite "spam". These layer 2 approaches are developing too slow and fees are rising quickly. 
What is next?

Except anyone can fork the code and create a new implementation that could fix any problem.

It's possible miner's are profiting on this somehow, but who knows. Either way, a 21MB mempool is really not a huge concern.

The value and purchasing power is not totally dependent on the time it took to create that amount of wealth denominated in USD, which means the price could decouple from your linear expression.

I wonder how it would change if the fiat exchange rate continued it's unique boom bust patterns and threw us into another relatively massive bubble.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:36:39
The psychology (and algorithm bots) driving the market seem to follow patterns. Booms and busts, and since there isn't any government or central authority dictating a limit on trades, or time of trading, or buying shares themselves with fiat paper like China, it's a truly free market.
@_date: 2015-07-23 04:25:29
Yeah, whether or not it's truly on the ledger certainly does matter

Fake, but there's a new dispensary right down the street anyway. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:53:40
It's supply and demand. If fees get crazy people will wait or stop and then demand goes down, fees go down, and equilibrium is reached.
It's not a doomsday scenario, just not what Satoshi envisioned but it takes a ton of time and effort to manifest the vision he had, it won't be exactly what he imagined.

It's their inaction which is leading to this. It's forcing other groups to take action and develop XT etc.
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:59:33
N one is forcing anyone to use Bitcoin Core. If the need and demand is for larger blocks, it will happen regardless.
In the meantime, higher fees will result as pressure to create new software implementations that keep Bitcoin competitive, which its already extremely competitve as far as fees go. Users will adapt. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:38:31

@_date: 2015-07-07 03:30:54
Then they get rebroadcasted later on, with higher fees, or people wait.
At least I'm already used to my bank taking a day to clear my deposit.

Bitcoin is the protocol and the nerwork. It would survive with or without Blockstream.
@_date: 2016-02-20 20:25:33
No, they can't. They are extremely manipulative.
@_date: 2016-02-22 02:23:59
If they ever intended on raising the blocksize, a Core hard fork would be required.

Do you want the "future of Bitcoin" to be wrapped up in people who have shown themselves to lack the former and the latter?
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:40:57
Core claims it's because of decentralization, but honestly they aren't helping that. 
Increasing miner fees exponentially only helps keep the largest miners with the biggest advantage and with most of their resources gained through centralization when higher and higher fees are required, which creates politically driven entities to attempt to dominate the conversation on both sides of the argument for personal gain by using these siphoned resources diverted from expanding through its artificially low size limit into "private blockchains". Not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:33:44
Accused is the right word.

Bitcoin Classic beta was also released yesterday and runs almost identical code but with the 2MB hard fork and no replace by fee.

@_date: 2016-02-03 16:59:10
Blockstream's business model is to profit from creating "private blockchains" and a separate private network for exchange that relies on centralized "hubs".
The key here really is that these are actually competing products that run counter to Bitcoin's decentralized nature. Blockstream has not demonstrated how Liquid or Lightning network can operate without central points of failure. They don't necessarily need Bitcoin to operate, they could use any other altcoin to piggy-back on, and so the idea that they have Bitcoin's best interest in mind is unsubstantiated.
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:48:13
Yes, we need the centralization, secrecy and middle men of Wall Street to tell us how Bitcoin works.

People are free to draw their own conclusions based on the events of the last few months especially. I wouldn't say it's necessarily Adam Back or Blockstream, it could be anyone, however the events are correlating and that's my point.

Great point. I think many 'off-chain' transactions will be made with 3rd party trusted services though in the future (ie Coinbase). Right now Coinbase can afford to push every transaction to the chain, but if  there arises a technical limitation to the number of transactions Bitcoin can handle and there is overwhelming number of transactions, the fees will have to go up. At this point I can imagine either alt-coins taking off some of the load, or trusted 3rd parties to manage transactions internally..which is not ideal and could result in bank failures, but hey, maybe that's a good thing?

I'm very serious about defending Bitcoin as much as anyone else and I'm very suspicious of the motives behind some of the key backers of Bitcoin related startups. 
Some are old-money types and their wealth is mainly denominated in USD, so naturally it's more than likely there a few black hats (in this case, people who have negative or selfish intentions for Bitcoin) among them, if not more than a few.

Debt gets more expensive among other things.
Now what will be interesting is if they decide to do negatove interest rates or QE infinity.

Absolutely spot on and helps to describe our current surveillance state and it's monitoring, sorting, categorizing and predicting algorithms which are beyond 1984.

Core &amp; Friends,
You're not "the" developers ok. You're one set of developers who happen to make 1 of the early instances of the Bitcoin client.
If you think there won't be more alt-clients, I believe you're very wrong.  Just the action of squashing the debate may prove Core serves a few particular special interests, ultimately,  their own self-interest.
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:46:58
I now own 650 BTC!
@_date: 2015-09-02 04:47:45
So by that definition, only if Core causes a hard-fork, is the resulting chain is considered Bitcoin.
How does that make sense?
@_date: 2015-09-02 16:12:31
As long as you don't frequently and openly discuss the so called "alt-coin" (which is really an *alt-client* using the same blockchain) Bitcoin "XT". If you're talking about Bitcoin "Core" and not in relation to blocksize, (there's a single thread for that ONLY) you should be ok.

Bitcoin works best with no drama? Meaning no rocking the boat,  no disrupting Cores dominance and the current status quo? No discussions of alt-clients or the rising corruption and conflicts of interest among the moderators on the major community forums? Meaning that Pantera Capital and other venture capitalists know what's best for Bitcoin? I don't think so..
No, of course just jump on a private plane and everything is fine and dandy. No need to worry, the old "smart" money knows what's best.

Awhile back someone posted an article about self-similar fractal expansion bubbles that occur in intervals over long periods of time, down from $1 to $100 to $1000  and who knows where next if it continues. 
I'd be interested to see if this coincides with a stock market plunge; unless of course we go above record highs on the S&amp;P and somehow, with a massively slowing global economy, keep up the illusion that it's a proper valuation. They know it's not, they're preparing for it now.

I understand both sides of the argument (reduced nodes, increased bandwidth, storage, etc) but the analysis suggests that none of these pose a significant risk to network performance or reliability in the short term and negligible risk long-term. Testing of BIP-101 has been successful so far. 
The fast approaching limit however, does pose a short and medium term risk for disruptions to reliability and performance, significant ones at that. These disruptions will damage Bitcoin's image and generate negative publicity.
To ignore the vested interests of those who currently control the commit access for the vast majority stake in the network is.. dangerous to say the least.

Welcome to the Silicon Valley. The land of opportunity, VC investment, former farm land and a vibrant, somewhat diminished counter-culture. You can find just about anything here, from $150 million mansions in the hills with a view of the city, to the thousands of homeless people who end up pushed into the creeks because of the lack of housing supply and a burgeoning tech equity explosion waiting to happen. Someone who hasn't ever worked as a manager in any capacity, nor ever qualified to upper management whatsoever can be considered for billions in VC investment as a CEO, because that job is a lot less difficult when you're pumped full of banker's VC cash. There are exorbitantly rich individuals and families, and there are very poor. It's a divided socioeconomic strata and it reflects much of the nation.

It is biased, everyone has bias and mine is against centralization in any form. What is centralization? Well that depends on who you ask, but in my opinion, if it only takes 5 or 6 entities to make major changes to the protocol, that's a high level of centralization, and that's what I take issue with.

The recent activation of RBF that is proceeding so quickly due to centralization in mining and software implementations is a great example. RBF may be benign in terms of wreaking havoc on dependent wallets and services, but there could be a change that breaks some wallets instantly. There should be a lot of forewarning and communication along with a proper risk assessment before those types of changes are committed.
If it only takes Core and 4 or 5 of the largest mining pools to push a change that could break dependent services, that would seem to be an issue no?

Trolls aren't stonewalling a blocksize increase, most Core Devs are, and that alone is the most controversial issue right now. Personal attacks are childish and do detract from the discussion, but recent developments involving Blockstream and this subreddit have been concerning at the least and do warrant a strong reaction. 
Dissent is very important when considering that development is concentrated in relatively few hands right now, especially ultimate commit access. By crushing discussion of alternative clients and banning users for doing so, the moderators only fan the flames of negativity and disruptive behavior.

I agree. And yes, the title came across as a bit aggravating, but I'm very concerned about the current politics surrounding Core. Peter and Greg may be CS geniuses, but we have to trust that they are acting in good faith with no ulterior motives, or vested interests.
How can we decentralize development? Alternate clients? This is a question that doesn't get much attention here, as most developers as you said, have an alliance with and contribute to Core since those changes are likely going to make it to production.

It's widely accepted that Nixon officially ended the gold standard in the US and abandoned the Bretton-woods agreement in 1971. His announcement is available on YouTube to review.
This also coincided with rapid and substantial fluctuations in the central bank's federal funds rate, which some economists blame for the painful recessions that followed. Essentially, we had abandoned sound money practices and moved into a completely fiat system, and since we maintain the world reserve currency, we had done so for most of the rest of the world at the same time.
Looking at inflation adjusted wages, employment and profits, from 1980 onward, we've experienced stagnantion followed by an accelerating decline (except briefly in the 1990s when the first tech bubble was being pumped) that has precipitated in recent decades as massive financial bubbles and rapid expansion of the monetary base in an effort to prevent total collapse or hyperinflation. It's required us to abandon free market principles and move into a world of fully centrally planned economies, by which markets react to announcements of QE and more 0% interest rates and not to free market fundamentals.

Personally, I think it's too late for the central banks.

Is there any possible way to identify blocks made by pools, by maintaining a database of known pools somehow? It seems odd the blockexplorers  are able to identify blocks by pool, what mechanism is used for that? IP?
Obviously requiring "registration" makes no sense, but if there was some way to flag blocks that carry some signature as produced by a pool that would be ideal, although I'm sure you have probably already thought of this. Just curious.

I'd like to see them try as well. They could try to buy up a ton of coins and dump them on the market, but that would be a short-term fluctuation which has less of an impact over time as the distribution of coins widens, and ultimately leads to higher prices relative to fiat.
I'm glad most of the coins (13M) are already distributed. They've been blindsided and cannot, as hard as they try, co-opt Bitcoin or manipulate the market in significant ways. That's the genius behind it all.

Some of what are referred to as "Core Devs" however are paid by this company Blockstream, and the Core Devs control the majority stake in the software releases that govern the protocol. They, along with the moderators, have reached the conclusion that anything that challenges the idea that the "Core" version of the Bitcoin protocol should control consensus is strictly against the rules of speech here. They literally will not allow the discussion of any clients that challenge Core's dominance from being spoken of if it "modifies the consensus" which is backwards logic.
It's not only blind circumstance that the moderators support the Core Devs interests as well as their connected companies.

Have we learned nothing about banks?! The reason Bitcoin was created was because of the failure of banks. It's important to transact and settle on the main chain because it means you can trust it's longevity in the case a "Bitcoin bank" goes fractional reserve and insolvent. You can't trust side chains unless they are open source and transparent.

There are no 3rd parties required when settling on the main chain, whereas your service is centralized and private.
Confirmation times on the main chain are much lower than any current inter-bank system and perform well enough for 99% of use cases.. 
Blockstream is creating a solution to a problem that it has helped prepetuate, by profiting from a limited main chain (blocksize) that it's apparent you, and your employees are bent on keeping that way.
Using your sidechains and protocol is vulnerable due to its private,  centralized nature.

Their role was also to keep our valuables secure and to provide an easier means of exchange (paper). Then they decided they could print as many notes as they wanted, regardless of any asset backing the increases in currency. 
Then they decided they could create "credits" with the same value as the $ and loan them out at extreme interest rates, and eventually, they became completely dependent on these credits and loans as they pumped dollars all over the world, devaluing the currency and driving people further into expensive debts.
Militarily they have maintained this hegemony by forcing nations that hold most of the raw energy (such as the middle east) into using the currency, exporting our inflation.
Finally, it's all come home now and we are experiencing the worst economic situation in a long, long time. Bitcoin will change this paradigm and open up equality to the value of labor to the entire world, by decentralizing and properly securing one of our most important assets, our money.

Individuals aren't solely driving the initial adoption. It will be a surge in holdings by large institutions that will drive the price up at first, and is right now.

Proving their on hand cash reserves relative to Bitcoin distribution would be nice.
@_date: 2016-07-04 21:20:19
Those are not examples of malice or intent to cause failure. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:33:51
In that case, I'll pass. Im not privy to giving the IRS my bank info and trading history. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:05:13
I imagine since most currencies would still stay weak against the dollar, it would still give the US Treasury an advantage to purchasing them..if they dare to abandon the Fed.

Which is why he funds companies that work towards centralizing transactions?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:21:50
An *AD* bot, seriously?!
@_date: 2015-02-07 00:46:02
Right? I mean come on, they freaking LIVE there. That's nuts.
@_date: 2015-10-19 00:42:24
This is exactly why this needs to be a high priority issue to fix. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 18:14:29
The banks could collapse due to gross mismanagment.
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:25:55
Said a central banker.
@_date: 2015-02-25 04:25:32
Congrats!! now join the 1 in 1,000,000 club next :)
@_date: 2015-02-02 00:50:29
Please, do tell, who are these exchanges?
@_date: 2016-07-31 21:52:43
Don't feed the trolls
@_date: 2015-02-13 00:59:55
This is great. I have to say though, that once the fees begin, I will be looking to another exchange that has free trades.
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:50:17
What other methods should be used for informing people? 
@_date: 2015-02-04 04:57:43
I'm working on some quantum bosonic wave algorithms running 34Qbit to do just this.
The issue is that future machines are using positron wave based algorithms instead of bosons which was released back in 2021. The dimensional phase shifting is having some issues with localized polarization, but that's the least of my worries.
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:41:46
Or two massive bubbles
@_date: 2016-07-05 08:46:14

Exactly, whoever it is trying to change it (and lets be honest, Internet identities are hard to trace) has a malicious reason for doing so given the amount of covert action being taken.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:20:21
Nice spread of FUD on a down day. You make the trolls proud.  
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:57:02
Yes they certainly have
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:58:40
Because then, you'd have 1 in 1,000,000
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:57:13
No, we won't
@_date: 2016-07-31 21:55:25
Isn't a picture of half of a pool in an indescript backyard enough for you people?
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:25:12
I can just imagine the beaches I'll be visiting with what I have in cold storage
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:35:03
I'd like to share with all of you this historic moment.  
This is truly and indeed an amazing achievement for a decentralized and distributed monetary protocol poised to release the world from debt and tyranny. 
To the Moon gentlemen, and may many more moonshots be with you in the years to come. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:26:46
When charts go parabolic, that's when major money is made trading...and lost.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:58:42
Why oh why would someone keep $100K on an exchange!!
@_date: 2017-06-14 02:54:11
Understood. I suppose commercial entities and large buyers and sellers should consider keeping as much as possible offline until common sense standards are placed on exchange businesses through competitive advantage. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:15:24
Very likely had nothing to do with it
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:53:17
Once we hit $4500, you'll see ~~$2800~~ as cheap
Edit: ~~$2900~~, $2700.This is a wild ride gentlemen. Hodl. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 03:47:07
RT a well.
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:58:10
This is an important point. Coinjar is very much like a bank in this regard.
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:15:11
Or plot to make themselves more money, but luckily, they'll have to do it legit or else they'll collapse under the weight of the security of the network and the public ledger.
They need to discuss ways to open up the ecosystem. drive 3rd party development apps, increase visibility and marketing and establish clear structure for interoperability.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:21:11
Or maybe move on to a different currency altogether.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:05:54
Make the process seamless by using hardware and software that eliminates the need to know the details.
People don't have to understand HTTPS, encryption and TCP/IP to use the internet, but it's more secure and still easy to use because of it.
@_date: 2016-07-05 08:35:55
What about the possibility that that has already happened covertly? No proof.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:48:43
I saw this collapse coming, expect more like it. Doesn't mean the currency is bunk, just means it's still highly volitaile. We all knew this from the beginning right?
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:36:03
What's in *your* wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:50:56
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:26:52
This is a very valid point. Hopefully the OP can deliver some opinion.
