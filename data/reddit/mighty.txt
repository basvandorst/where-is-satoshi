The thing with finding the best place to buy bitcoin online is that there is more than one single excellent option out there. For example kraken, bitstamp, coinbase are great sites when looking how to invest in bitcoin. Why are they such popular places? Mainly because one can buy btc on a trustworthy platform and in large volumes if necessary. That's at least the way I see it. 
There are other very good sites to purchase bitcoin, like btc-e, paymium, cex io, and even paxful offers paypal to bitcoin. After you have done the necessary research, you can choose an exchange that suits your need best. For example, if you're looking for the best way to buy bitcoins uk then bitstamp is a good choice because they accept GBP. They also have an outstanding reputation within the community. I would go with them instead of looking where to buy bitcoin in europe. Also a good idea is to read reviews online before transferring money onto a service. That way you know how secure it is.
In reference to your above comment about how to buy bitcoin anonymously: I know that this is different in your case, but there are also sites that let you buy with cash ( eg bitquick or using an atm). These are places to remember if anyone asks you for some no verification services in the future, as most traditional exchanges ask for passport ID. 
While those colleague of your should be researching how to buy bitcoin stock instead of sending coins off to this random address, I think that the price will rise so it's a good idea to purchase some extra for later. Hope this information helps.
