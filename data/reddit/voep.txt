I personally want to thank the chairman a lot for that beutiful statement. Everyone should send a letter of appreciation of behalf of the crypto community for expressing the fault in the current used financial system. Crypto and block-chains are the future.

This is just stating the obvious but in such a negative way. Of course the masses arent gonna adopt over 2 months. Crypto is in a infantile stage. And theres a lot of money to be made from the masses adapting to blockchain technology over the next 20 years.

Well said Tit

Well now we know that this OP didn't profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:37:50
irrelevant fork.

Whenever you need to access an exchange, use a vpn just to make sure your fingerprint is as small as possible. On top of it you can use TOR browser aswell.

Hi Ken.
Glad to hear that crypto have sparked your interest. A beginner friendly site to start with would be coinbase. On coinbase you can purchase BTC,ETH,LTC and BCH with wire transfer, bank or credit card. Credit card use have a higher fee than the other two. Coinbase also host Gdax.com which only have a fee of .25%

I saw this tesla outside of dreamhack winther today. Ez.

You're welcome

Do you recall what wallet you used back then?
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:06:40
Yes i forget that one always. I personally dont use it but it works. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:18:23
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:03:45
Litecoin is what you are looking for then.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:13:41
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:19:47
But Tor browser is free of use. But you have to know that it is not 100 procent secure on its own without a vpn's extra layer.

You should only hold currency which you know you have a short term in on an exchange. Anything which you HODL, should be moved to either a paperwallet, desktop wallet(exodus) or an offline wallet like nano ledger. Remember to never invest more than you can afford to lose. I wish you good luck with crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:37:21
Yes friend
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:04:30
Get CCcleaner and analyse your ssd and you can remove the files.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:50:28
You would then need to install same wallet, check out on their FAQ how to recover a wallet
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:07:15
For now, with the current transactions fee etc on bitcoin and with lightning network in the works. You would probably be better off with putting your money in either cheap ether, or LTC right now. And move this to a wallet.

He did
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:49:28
Wouldnt say "shortly" with the current 40+ min of transaction time. But yeah, shortly
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:43:58
Try looking into Litecoin, Vertcoin, Verge, OmiseGO, Monero and IOTA. But also XRP(ripple) the banks already use this currency for over-sea transactions.

What do you get from running a node

I am to be satisfied in any way with whatever the outcome. This is what can happen: 1. Bitcoin goes towards 100k through 2018. 2. Bitcoin crashes in 2018-2020 and we all get to watch McAffee eat his own dick. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:06:21
Missed the boat? The first 10k is only the beginning 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:40:16
Why let such a small thing get to you. You might take  off to the moon any day. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:51:01
Where is the logic in that sentence. First and most efficient way to deal with trolls is: ignore, report, repeat. You make yourself look bad even to people who share same viewpoint as you, when you engage in personal attacks. (Whether it is trolls or just people who have a different POV) 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:48:07
No problem
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:01:56
There is a market for this on fb. Just find a proper group with high activity and a list of trusted members. How you should perform these straight up p2p transactions are up to you, but I will highly suggest a group from within your own nationality and let the person with the USD go first using whatever fast transaction bankapp you both may have. Like MobilePay(denmark)
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:38:42
Pump n dump
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:11:12
Go for it 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:43:04
Thread is just full of you making "personal" attacks on anyone who doesn't share your view. Cmon you can express yo self better. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:41:12
Who's there?
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:00:44
meh. On to the next news
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:41:08
I concur.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:48:44
I would have waited till after the forks
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:11:51
Lightning network is gonna change all you know about BTC so far. Just hang on there, and calm down for a minute bud. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:28:31
Because bitcoin is down. Its essential that you learn how the different currencies adjust to eachother and also you gotta trade in satoshis. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:16:48
Im not sure how his wife would take that comment.
