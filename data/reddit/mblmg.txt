So, how do I update the client? I'm afraid that I have to download the blockchain again which took me about two days the first time.

I did. Maybe it expired some time during the THREE FUCKING WEEKS they took to check it.
But if that was the case, why didn't they tell me so but instead claimed that my application was incomplete or altered? Horrendous service, I must say.

Maybe because I'm in Germany and they needed someone to translate my documents. I don't know. I only know I waited three weeks only to be rejected with no real reason given.

I trade there, too. Mt.Gox sucks anyway.

This looks really great and much more comfortable than Mt.Gox.
I registered now and am now awaiting the verification of my bank account. I can only hope they are faster than Mt.Gox...

Well, I'm totally new to Bitcoin and I wanted to transfer money from my bank account to Mt.Gox, so I can buy Bitcoins from there. But when I tried this, it told me to verify so I can use SEPA transactions.

I had a look at bitinstant but as far as I can tell there is no way for me to use it with a German bank account.
The country selector does not feature Germany even though there is a screenshot in the *How it works*-section that shows Germany selected.
Maybe they removed it?

But.... it tells me so?
