Maybe they are only targeting accounts with a balance. Mine is empty.

If you think about it, the price will not crash significantly.
Whoever buys the bitcoins at auction will probably not want to sell them below what they bought them for.
It just wouldn't make sense for someone to crash the market. The lowest price btc would go to, would probably be the price at which the buyer bought the btc.

Well you only pay capital gains tax when you sell bitcoin... So you would have dollars to pay the tax. (Unless you only used bitcoin to buy goods or services)

Last time they auctioned them they sold them above market price. The price has more than halved since then, I think people will not make that mistake again.
I would expect the price to fall anyway, as it brings a large supply of bitcoin back into the market.

Winners will be notified today by 17:00 EDT.
So there is still another 6 hours before anyone will know. Although they might notify winners earlier.
Winners then need to provide proof that they have initiated a transfer by EOP 1st July.
Once the US has received the funds, they will send the bitcoins.
So the bitcoins will probably move between Wednesday and Friday.

If the auction bidders believed that they would have already bought bitcoins on the exchanges up to their bid price. In my opinion this is what we saw yesterday, so the highest bid was around 596 to 600.

The pre2013 writers you talk of were probably early adopters/investors, whose agenda was to promote bitcoin and create demand/hype for bitcoin and in turn push the price up. So they still did it for the money, and I'm sure it paid off nicely for them.

You shouldn't be using your personal account for bitcoin.
You should have one opened just for Bitcoin, and it should be with a different bank to your personal account. That way it's not a big problem if your funds get frozen.

BTCE can contact the account owner and ask for proof of where the coins came from.
If they suspect the coins to have been acquired through illegal ways, then that account should remain frozen, and law enforcement notified.
Just like if you deposit money into a bank and they suspect you of money laundering, you need to show proof of where this money came from and that it was obtained legally. If not, then the bank would freeze your account and contact law enforcement.
BTCE can choose who it provides it's services to. Just like any bank can as well.

Sellers will usually ask you for a selfie with your ID. This can help them reduce the risk of fraud.
Someone buyers will try to chargeback the transaction after receiving the bitcoins. They will tell their bank they got hacked or something like that. So that's why.
I don't think you have much to worry about with reputable sellers.
They are only really interested in seeing that your name matches your ID, bank card, bank account and localbitcoin account.
You can usually blank out the parts they are not interested in.
Despite all that, sellers still get de-frauded sometimes.
