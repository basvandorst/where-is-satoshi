There is also a lot of shadow banking in china by means of inventory of raw materials etc. Guess the Chinese "investors" are used to navigate outside the banking world

Bitcoin will be regulated or outlawed. I just don't agree with the comments in the other topics about we do not need regulation because,# insert libertarian or anarchist argument here. 
if Bitcoin is to go anywhere it is bound to be noticed by governments and be regulated. Better lobby for a very flexible regulation and benefit from it. 
Don't forget the more important and widely accepted Bitcoin becomes the average person will use it too and due to the wild west scenario will lose money and then start to cry about it, because hey in the wild west of Bitcoin everything goes. That will not work in the long term. 
From a European standpoint, America has a very flexible financial regulation. Probably it won't be that bad. If you are scared of regulation and taxation visit us on our side of the pond.

10k? How could you possibly ever think that. Name one other currency that is worth 10k.

The alleged death treats aside (which aren't ok) she should have expected the massive response her article would unleash. Why else would she research the story in the first place.
so good for her having a break in the mountains and a nice view. Makes me think is she in the Caucasus with putin? practicing a possible invasion on Ukraine?

It is would be BS because if they green lit his withdraw in the system how come the transaction system can suddenly do it for him and not the rest? 
But if they would do it manually like you suggest, how about they do it manually for the other 40k btc outstanding withdraws? 
Just because this guy screams the loudest doesn't mean he should be the first to be served. 
Again, I know it is horrible if it were your btc/fiat in limbo, by no means I mean to be inconsiderate to OP. 
Maybe because exchanges are a central node in the bitcoin economy, regulation is needed to reassure people that even though they go bust, your ''money'' is save.

I don't know how much btc you have still on mt gox and it really sucks for you, I can imagine.
However it would be very weird if your withdrawl got through due some persistent nagging. It would mean that the technical problems are BS and the one with the loudest voice always get what they want.  
I would be very interested in the video.

Mark karpeles is a French citizen, so he doesn't have to go to the USA. Maybe we forget that sometimes. That being said, this guy will remain a ghost haunting the bitcoin scene for a long time.

I think OP is referring to classic bubble pattern graphs
