Okay great.  I'll have to VPN that but I can us a NJ server or something and I guess I don't have to give them my address.

Bittrex was stated in another comment that its not bitlicense compliant. That's where the confusion is coming from.
Edit: But I'm finding out that its an exchange that only accepts crypto instead of fiat for purchases. I guess that's where it becomes okay?

Never thought about VPN. There aren't steps of verification that would ruin it?

Thanks for the advice. Since Bittrex is fine for NY I have everything I need to get started.

How does one get BCC? If you wanted to.

Well I wouldn't if I didn't have to.  Is there a better way that you recommend for NY resident?

Hey sweater, do you know if coinbase close to realtime buy/selling by any chance?  Gemini takes 2 weeks for verification.

Hey again crypto, since you seem to know a lot about good exchanges, I was wondering if there are any exchanges for NY residents or the States that allow you to trade CFDs and other financial instruments for down-trend profitability?  This is a lot to ask for from what I've heard regarding regulations, but I thought I'd ask.  More or less, where can I find better/different forms of trading Bitcoin other than on the price.
