That's all publicly available information direct from her bio page on the article's website.

It does happen. It happens through the card issuer though, so VISA/Mastercard/AMEX will work with the merchant, identify the cards and then issue a list to the banks. 
From the Albertson's hack, the bank I work for is re-issuing 21,000+ cards and Albertson's claims the data wasn't even accessed. We know what card numbers may POTENTIALLY be compromised, and are monitoring those accounts more than usual for fraud activity.

That whole part is possibly only half truth anyway.




Yeah, bullshit some random cop would know who Satoshi is.

I did specify a system that I could walk into a store and use today, not that I don't believe there are better ways to do things. 
Debit in the USA is basically a direct line to your checking account, you use a 4 digit pin, and the funds are immediately debited. Largely, this "debit card" can also be used as a VISA or Mastercard to do credit-card purchases that will settle in a day two. The card number is the same and I use the same card to buy groceries using debit and the pin number and junk off Amazon using the VISA credit card functionality.
I disagree that people are unaware of problems though, talk to randoms on the street about their bank service and you will find many that have gripes. The huge industry behind keeping the current system in place IS a good observation, which is why the most important factor in the future of bitcoin is merchant adoption because like I said, for people to move to an alternative the system needs to be in place and easy as swiping a card and entering an easy password. Everything else is really secondary to that.

Sure, but people talk about forging all of their paperwork for the verification with all kinds of nonsense and never being caught. If someone was smart enough to steal the coins they might have been smart enough to fake an electric bill.

This is probably the highest traffic article the site has had. Selling newspapers is her job, so she's doing it pretty well, even if she's falling on her face now.

You can't just cancel people's cash pipeline (legally or ethically). We are already re-issuing the cards, things just take time to be printed and mailed, and then the customer needs to activate the new card before the old is disabled. The whole can take 90 days. And this is AFTER figuring out there has actually been a breach. The Albertson's system breach happened June 22 - July 17, and here we are starting the re-issue process August 21.
People are not nearly as dumb to not realize the credit/debit card system has flaws, there is just no easy, safe, and reliable system in place for a majority of consumers to buy into yet. What system can I as a customer, walk into 99% of businesses with right now, that will allow me to trade for goods and services without cash in my hand?

This is a lot of $10 words for someone who didn't read what was in the image, and doesn't know anything about credit unions.

You don't remember the posts back in April about people taking out large loans to buy in at $200+?
.... Or some of the posts with suicide hotline information in them when things were dipping below $100...

Not only that, but the numerous fees he is paying each month for check cashing, debit card re-reloading, and bill-pay services are well in excess of anything that would be charged by any bank to do the same things. 
The logic that mearely having a bank account makes you go broke makes no sense and typically people that make decent wages but stil have zero savings are just bad with money period. Number of bank accounts has nothing to do with it.

Nobody "adds" anything back. Banks pay for insurance to cover things like this, or write it down in their balance sheet as other moentary loss. Nobody just prints for money to cover theft.
In your scenario, the bank would claim the $50k loss against their insurance, then the insurance company would pay the $850k to put the guy in jail, and seek restitution.

Yeah, I'm real confused too. 2.4Mh/s is like 4 7950s, so it's not like these guys are already running a farm and are looking for investment to grow.
They are selling shares to buy everything from the ground up which seems a bit sketchy to me.
