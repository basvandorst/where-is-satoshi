People hype up their preferred cryptos all the time [which isn't and shouldn't be illegal] and now that it's not your crypto or at the expense of it, you want the government to intervene? What? People in this sub always seem to be free market libertarians of convenience.

You do realize that 99% of volume is currently on centralized exchanges that also don't have the transnational flaws of BTC?
And it's way easier to short bitcoin and sell under market price on a crypto exchange than it will be with the CME. The CME intends on halting trading if the price changes more than 7% in a day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:39:05
I think someone tried that but it didn't work. So I don't think it's possible.
But principally it's wrong because bitcoin is a completely opensource project and a fork is a fork. It was designed from the beginning to be that way and then let market decide which is the "real" bitcoin. But markets take time for price discovery so in the short term it's completely subjective which fork is the "real" bitcoin.

To be fair, it's a completely reasonable statement, considering there are thousands of different blockchain designs some of which are arguably more advanced technologically. And some of these "advancements" are completely incompatible to bitcoins design so no amount of forking bitcoin could catch up.
In all of history I don't think there has ever been a technology where the first implementation was the best there ever was.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:29:50
I'm not sure what their exact algorithm is but fees for most services and wallets are basically just set by the current market rate for fees. 
Meaning you're basically just bidding to be included in the next block. But since bitcoin has really small blocks that makes it space super scarce and therefore increases the transaction fee.
That said no wallet or exchange is perfect at setting the appropriate tx fee.

And unfortunately it's not "good enough" to be used as digital cash as it stands today. I've been hearing about how lightning is just around the corner for almost 2 years and still no major strides in scaling. It could happen, but I think it's a lot further away than people realize if it happens at all. That said I'm still very bullish for it's use as digital gold and some alt(s) will probably fill in as the cash part.
There are already several blockchains that have 1000+ TPS and some claim 50,000 TPS... Today not next year. In a industry thats growing exponentially I really doubt bitcoin is going to be able to keep up. There are blockchains that have already scaled to nearly 1000x of bitcoin, just let that sink in.

This is so stupid to get angry over. If you believe in free markets then the market should be able to decide which cryptocurrencies it prefers. And you can't blame coinbase, they are a business trying to make money, the more coins they list the more money they can make. You can't just get mad because a crypto you don't like increases in value. Its like getting made that apple stocks are rising after being listed and calling for a boycott of the nasdaq because you own microsoft stocks. It's very silly.

@_date: 2017-12-11 20:34:25


Yes, but I'd argue that bitcoin is like a pager and [**insert technologically superior blockchain here**] is like apple. Why would you invest in pagers that might be slightly sleeker and smaller in a year when apple already has the iphone?


Yes it is... TPS is correlated to transaction fees/time for most blockchains. And people don't like having to wait days or pay extremely high transaction fees.


It's true that there are often technologies that arrive after or at the same time as other technologies but don't succeed even though they are superior, but this is usually due to the advantage being marginal and not significant enough to push people to change there behavior and so the tech never really takes off. For example HD DVDs never really replaced regular dvds even though they were objectively better. However digital streaming like netflix was a significantly superior product/service that essentially has.
Here is something to think about, how often has the very first implementation of a technology ever been the best and the last? How often has it maintained it's value? Very rarely. I mean it's like saying that laser disk is here to stay even if netflix comes along because it has the first movers advantage on digital video. Peter Thiel talks about this very topic in Zero to One in which he states that you can't be 10%, 25%, or even 50% better to compete against an incumbent, it's got to be at least 10x better. Objectively speaking, with TPS alone, there are already blockchains that are not just 10x better but 1000x better. And TPS is just one of many things that could be improved.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:49:13
This does happen with really low volume alts from time to time in an attempt to manipulate price. Some times it's even happened by accident on ether delta because their UI is such shit.
However the reason why this would be basically impossibly for bitcoin is because there is lots of **real** volume and trading going on and it's highly liquid comparatively.
Sure an attacker trying to manipulate the price might be willing to buy bitcoin at say 10x it's currently level, problem is that the seller just made $10 off of his $1 worth of BTC which he will now buy back at the market rate because he knows there is still thousands of people willing to sell at the actual rate. So the attacker is guaranteed to lose money unless there volume is extremely small the price just falls back down to market rates very quickly.

Oh yeah because men have been stopping women since 2009  from googling "bitcoin", researching , and thinking for themselves about if bitcoin, the most free market asset ever created, was a good investment or not.
Seriously, though this the most stupid argument I've ever heard. Those 99% of hodlers probably researched bitcoin for awhile and decided to take the risk of buying. Women are just as capable of doing the exact same thing. I think this just goes to show that there is clearly a difference (on average) in the interests of men and women. You can only blame the women for not buying bitcoin if they don't have any.

@_date: 2017-12-03 12:18:16
The fact that bitcoin is so easily moved makes it even more volatile than gold. 
Gold and bitcoin are completely different assets. Theres no reason to assume they would both be in bubbles at the same time and pop at the same time. On top of that gold has been through many bubbles throughout it's history.
And gold has went through several bubbles. It's extremely naive to think bitcoin isn't susceptible to bubbles especially since it has a history of it.

I would argue that the more volatile it is the more susceptible it is to bubbles.
The ideas that an asset can both be in a bubble and undervalued[in the long term] are not mutually exclusive.
I don't think bitcoin will be priced in properly for decades, but that doesn't mean there won't be many booms and busts along the way.

It's a victim of it's own success.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:44:17
Seriously, you should put 50% of that back into fiat ASAP the remaining 25% for day trading 25% for hodling.
Otherwise I predict you are going to go completely broke very fast. It's a very bad idea to day trade with your life savings.
Modern day traders are computer programmers that use advanced risk analysis and AI processing multiple trades at once. So not only will you probably not be able to make trades better than chance, but you'll probably make trading decisions that are worse than flipping a coin because of your own emotions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:04:12
As long as it's money you can afford to lose then yes. It's possible we might be in a bear market now given the bitcoin network is having issues with scaling so transactions on the network are very slow or expensive depending on your preference to pay large fees or not.
That said yes you can pull out to fiat currency at anytime if you have that money on an exchange. I would recommend bittrrex. But moving the fiat from an exchange back into a fiat bank accounted is a little bit more complicated but definitely possible.

@_date: 2018-05-19 18:47:27
Data was taken from coinmarketcap from 2014 to present.
1 = 1,000,000,000 USD
I believe this shows that not only is every dollar traded in a 24hr period add more than an order of magnitude to the marketcap, but the relationship is non-linear. So 10x increase in volume will be more than a 10x increase in marketcap on average. Perhaps related to metcalfes law?

There's nothing wrong with it per se. 
But you're right. Hodlers are denying the fact that there is little real world demand for cryptocurrency at the moment. And that having 50 billion new icos a day for simple utility tokens isn't helping, it's basically diluting the supply. Most ICOs are nothing but shitty coupons for a business that hasn't even proved themselves viable. I'm all for ICOs of coins that actually provide dividends or are backed by IRL assets though. I think that's the true killer app of blockchain.

Ah yes this is true, however it's already somewhat filtered for higher prices because as I said in the comments this is data from 2014-present. 
In order to do this properly I'd need to do a non-linear regression to find the best fit curve. But I'm lazy and haven't touched any ML libraries in awhile.
But I think this data is interesting enough as it is.
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:10:02
Yes, as I said in my comment, the relationship is non-linear. So as (average) 24hr volume increases linearly marketcap increases exponentially. 
With the time frame I selected I got a correlation coefficient of 94%. So the numbers are certainly related. But this is broscience so take it with a grain of salt.

Exactly, I personally think there should be almost no regulation of ICOs. Let people crowd fund however they want. But if a company does do an outright scam than get them after the fact, like with bitconnect.
Even a lot of people in this sub don't "get" blockchain entirely. There are financial instruments that could never exist before and so much actual wealth that can be created. Regulation will just send the innovation and wealth to other countries.
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:42:31


Technically they did help out all the bitcoin hodlers by making it that much more scarce.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:27:07
But the thing is you can't have the rule makers breaking the rules that they imprison the peasants for. Play fair or don't play at all(i.e. have a total free market)
But I agree, this sub is full of libertarians of convenience. They want all the "fraudulent" ICOs to be investigated so that regulators will come down hard on them. Which is rather self serving since it potentially means less competition for their investment. There's a very funny trend in that when bitcoin is mooning everyone says "NO REGULATIONS LET IT GROW NATURALLY", since even a rumor can cause a crash. But when it's crashing "OOHH WE NEED MORE REGULATIONS TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING!"
But don't worry blockchain is indestructible. No amount of regulation can stop it. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:36:11
It's called Heteroscedasticity.
I don't think you can come to that conclusion of more hodling and less buying since volume means trading. 
The correlation is positive with r=0.94 which is the opposite of what you are saying, volume gets stronger as market cap gets larger, it's just that the variation between the two variables also increases slightly.
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:34:34
Personally, I don't care so much about the legal aspects as the market can figure this stuff out on its own eventually. And a lot of legit projects hire third party audits ect. And if a project doesn't follow through on promises people just dump the coin. Plus it's easy to sue after the fact.
The problem lies in the business model of 99% icos. They are just giving out some bullshit utility token for their platform that likely relies on mass adoption of cryptocurrency. You are basically just getting coupons and giftcards from a company. But really shitty ones that fluctuate in value.
What the market needs is more security and equity based tokens that entitle people to profit or shares in the company.
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:19:39
Just another case of denial of the obvious.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:49:42
There is no distinction between volume and "new money volume". Either new people are bringing new money or not.
And I'm not sure why you think people A) have no intention of selling(in the short term) and B) won't change their mind. If this bubble has taught us anything it's that crypto is a mad house. I mean we have a fucking dog meme that's worth half a billion dollars. Most people, once they actually have cryptocurrency can have it on an exchange in minutes.
There's new exchanges popping up in crypto practically everyday, not including BTMs, and other on ramps that are potential competition to local bitcoins, thus driving down any premiums over regular exchange rates. And same goes for more secure fiat to crypto gateways. If you're bullish on adoption you'd expect more on ramps, if your bearish you'd expect less and also less volume, so you can't have your cake and eat it too.
So any non-agreeable sale prices or lack of liquidity is not gonna be a huge hurdle for people wanting to sell when the price can jump up 40% in a couple weeks, hell I'm not convinced it's a hurdle for most people now. And you're assuming new hands are strong hands, when I can assure you the opposite is true.
Lastly, it makes no sense to say liquidity low but volume is high. They are almost the same thing.
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:43:36


Yes, it was in a bubble. It lost 90% of it's stock value from the ATH in the tech bubble before recovering a decade later. 


This is just simply not true. If you move the BTC ATH back a few months on this graph or to any other point, it doesn't fit arbitrarily the same way. Try and fit that BTC graph to some other economic graph that isn't a bubble and prove me wrong :)
The tech bubble is the most analogous moment in history to the BTC bubble and although it isn't identical, it is very similar. A bubble is a bubble no matter the scale.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:46:20
What's surprising is bitcoin hasn't actually fallen as hard relatively as the NASDAQ during the tech bubble, it's still rather bullish.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:54:20
Although volume and new users is definitely a good thing for the long term, volume itself doesn't mean much in the short term(months).
As price can decrease with volume. I mean today was the most volume we've had in several and yet it's dumping. 
Also, local bitcoins volume has been increasing steadily since the last bubble. So I think a continued steady increase isn't that big of a deal in the short term. So baring crypto now being at "critical mass"(i.E. a nonlinear increase in volume going forward) to take over the world entirely, we are looking at a "meh" market for awhile. I don't think it'll be terrible, but not great.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:32:50
As per traditional you should always take the opposite of this guys advice on bitcoin. So I guess that's a buy signal.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:25:21
So the main difference is timescale. In bitcoin it happened in about 1-2 years but with the NASDAQ it happened in 5-10 years.
So if we pretend the NASDAQ bubble can tell us anything about the future of the market it will be another 2-4 years before an ATH in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:37:00

@_date: 2018-05-21 21:20:36
Why filter out larger market prices? That seems like an arbitrary thing to do to "fit" the data. Especially since there isn't any extreme outliers, like the price going 100x in a single day or something.
Not to mention since the data is clearly heteroscedastic that virtually guarantees removing higher market prices will actually increase the correlation because the variance between the variables decreases with the market price. You'll be left with an even tighter correlated data set.
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:32:14


This is very much up for debate. According to traders like Soros with his concept of reflexivity  free markets will actually tend toward extremes, not stability. In fact the efficient/equilibrium market hypothesis, might not be true at all or at least very in complete which is why three different versions of it exist: weak, mild and strong. And this is why Soros is very much a socialist in favor of regulation because he thinks free markets are naturally unstable. 
And we also have other thinkers/traders like Nicolas Taleb who think over-stability can actually be a bad thing as it can make the market vulnerable to a "blackswan". According to  him you would probably actually want the maximum variation (to the extent that it's still viable for its us case) of the asset as opposed to the maximum stability. He thinks usually systems that are overly stable are usually that way artificially and are fragile.
If you look at say the USD or EURO they are actually very stable, but it's created artificially which makes them vulnerable to unexpected events. Central banks are clearly fragile, see 2008.

Although it might be a bit hyperbolic, it would have a huge impact. It is possible that the SEC could basically cause all US based crypto exchanges to shutdown overnight since they have been tradinge illegally in securities. Even if this only had a small impact on trading volume, the news itself is enough to crash this market.


I 100% agree. Technically to invest in an ICO you need to be an accredited investor, (I.E. be a millionaire) which is absurd. Crypto can seriously help normal people invest in alternative ways rather than just cash. But I don't have much faith in the US government since they throw people away for life for vicitimless crimes like possession of pot. They might come down hard even on the small guys.

Lots of projects just did airdrops and then later sold some on the open market to raise funds. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:13:37


This is extremely easy to verify. [It's around 80-90% according to coinmarketcap](


I'm talking not about what it can do, but what the market is currently using it for, and it's mostly being used for cryptocurrency trading more than anything else. If tomorrow morning all altcoins are labeled illegal and trading stops, the price of bitcoin would plummet since most of the demand is coming from trading. Simple economics my friend.

That's my point, you either pay for the speed or you wait. It's entirely true that using the bitcoin network for "instant" payments has become uneconomical compared to traditional means in most cases. As the example goes, a coffee shop isn't going to wait 90 minutes to make sure your transaction went through, and you aren't going to pay $60 in fees for a cup of coffee. [And yes that's entirely true given the current cost per transaction (click for source)](
This would be even more true for people living in third world countries. Even if a transaction was only $0.25 that's already too much for many people given their low income. Sure it still will be okay for people in the first world maybe ordering things online when you can wait awhile for the transaction to clear, but in a lot of cases this won't work. 
Not only that, if bitcoin doesn't start making some serious ground in scaling it will become more and more expensive. The cost per transaction is already 10x what it was last year.
I do have doubts bitcoin will end up being the "digital cash" given that there are several blockchains that can already process 1000 TPS. But It'll always be here. Worst case scenerio it will just be digital gold.

Sure it would have an effect on the market, but it wouldn't be enough to effect it significantly as the price of bitcoin is made mostly by a very high volume of trading on exchanges, and most traders don't use coinbase for trading.
The 24hr trading volume is around $4 billion. And coinbase only makes for a small percentage of that.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:06:46


Do you really have a hard time believing that there are fiat coins in circulation that are made out of 50% silver? Does this really even need to be addressed? [But if you really have a hard time believing it here is a link]( And I was wrong, it's actually 80% silver. 


I'm saying that most physical/cash currencies generally have more buying/barter on the current market than the material that they are made of. For example a single $100 note can easily buy you 100x the amount of paper of that $100 note. Canada stopped producing pennies a few years ago because it was costing 6 pennies to produce 1 coin. So the coin is actually worth more than the penny. If you had $100 worth of pennies it is now a more profitable to melt them down and sell them for their raw material than to spend them as "currency". 


Ya ya we've heard it all before. Bitcoin is too volatile blah blah blah. What this argument completely ignores is that bitcoin and tech is a completely new and immature asset market. As time goes and it becomes more liquid and traded globally volatility will decrease. Even the USD has had times of very high volatility. And it's already less volatile than several fiat currencies. Bitcoins biggest threat at the moment isn't economical but technological. If it can't find scaling solutions fast enough, it will probably only ever be digital gold while other currencies take over the cash aspect of the crypto space. Like ripple or dash.
And yes all currencies will be crypto in the next 30 years. Governments may issue or adopt crypto but I really don't think fiat as we know it is gonna last. The crypto cat is already out of the bag.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:57:45
Yes anyone can update it as it is open source. But basically the majority of nodes would have to choose to run this new code update in order for bitcoin to be "updated". 
So basically the short answer is "democracy" as anyone can operate a bitcoin node and "vote" for a particular upgrade for the protocol. Just like how anyone can run for president, but obviously not just anyone can actually be the president. 
Obviously, the majority of bitcoiners won't knowingly "vote" for bad evil code that would steal all of their bitcoin for example. So game theory dictates that it is always most profitable for people to vote for the upgrades that will make bitcoin the most profitable for them, i.e. good improvements. Therefore as long as people are greedy bitcoin will evolve towards being a better system.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:59:08
Yes unless all bitcoin transactions staff off chain... This might be disastrous especially right now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:08:02
Without that persons actual argument it's impossible to address. Maybe post at least a link?
Of course people can always steal your bitcoin or scam you into giving it to them as with fiat currency.
But if you mean can the bitcoin network be hacked? Can you duplicate a bitcoin? No that's impossible.
The closest thing I know of is a double spend. But that's only really possible if the fraudster(sender) is anonymous and the person receiving the bitcoin doesn't wait for enough confirmations on the transaction. A double spend is basically just sending bitcoin to several places at once thus causing several wallets to appear to be receiving the same bitcoin at the same time, however once enough confirmations happen and the network reaches consensus only one of those transactions actually goes through. Therefore you could trick someone into thinking you had sent them bitcoin when in fact you just sent it to yourself and then run away with whatever they paid for before the network reaches consensus. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:37:06
The advantage is that its the best investment in human history. It's arguably the best store of value ever created or discovered. Contrast that with even the best fiat currencies that have 3% inflation a year.
So tell me do you want your savings account to be worth more or less next year?
What's happening right now is equivalent to **((the gold rush) + (the oil boom)) X (the internet bubble) = bitcoin** .

Here is something I don't get, even if it is somebody attacking the network by spam, it's still a vulnerability that could be solved by scaling no? Not only that, a bunch of low fee transactions would probably be much more common as it because mainstream.

I think that's widly naive. Sure there might be 1 or 2 top ones that take 80% of the market share but theres probably going to be hundreds of thousands of cryptos. We aren't just talking about electronic cash, but the internet of value. We are heading towards a future where everything that can be tokenized on a blockchain, probably will be. For example stocks will eventually just be on the blockchain along with other assets, and it's probably not going to be on bitcoins blockchain.
 And even if that were true the point of buying and hodling the top 4 is diversification, in hopes that at least one of those will be the top dog in the long term.

There is absolutely a need for high frequency trading. The more trading the healthier the market becomes generally.
If bill gates wanted to throw down a few hundred million at bitcoin one day the price would sky rocket because there wouldn't be enough liquidity. This makes it less usable as a currency because of volatility. More trading means less volatility. I don't see any reason why inhibiting that would be a good thing for the health of the market.
That said, I'm not convinced that a decentralized blockchain exchange would even be fast enough for regular day trading because settlement takes way too long and is too expensive. At least with bitcoin and litecoin. Although decentralized exchanges will still have there place but I suspect that unless some really advanced blockchain developments come about making it fast, they will always be worse for liquidity compared to traditional exchanges.

As cool as it would be, I really doubt it. Lots of people know C++ and could just as easily fit the bill. And I mean Elon Musk could have always been deceptive about his knowledge of Bitcoin but the times he has talked about it in years past it really seemed like he didn't know a lot about it and didn't really understand the vision behind it. Although I would guess he probably knows more about it now. Contrast that with billionaire Richard Branson who has formally embraced bitcoin as a form of payment for virgin galactic circa 2015. And Branson has always seemed to "get it" when he has talked about it publicly. 
That said, if anyone/satoshi could say "I've moved on to other things." before disappearing, and actually meant it, it would be Elon. Since he has mars colonies to worry about.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:19:49
To play devils advocate, the thing holding this back is the fees and transaction speed. 
It has a long way to go to be competitive with a centralized exchange. Especially since a lot of traders use bots for high frequency trading.
I'm very skeptical that updating balances on two blockchains could ever be as fast/cheap or faster than updating an SQL database on a server. High frequency trading is very important for liquidity. If the markets aren't liquid enough there will be an even higher cost for making those trades.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:50:15

Blockchain based IOUs for the $USD issued (or in relation) to the crypto exchange bitfinex.
So you can store them in a hardware wallout or paper wallet. Or any type of crypto wallet. Problem is if Bitfinex doesn't actually have the collateral or if they go under then hundreds of millions of tethers/dollars could be worthless.
Most crypto exchanges actually use tether instead of actual dollars so it would cause a wave across the cryptoverse for sure.

Yes it's called bitpesa, if you have a smartphone you can always use services like the coinbase app.
If your talking about just sending and receiving bitcoin, yes there has been cell phone apps for that for years.
Purchasing bitcoin isn't really that much of a problem for people with bank accounts and/or credit cards. The problem is transaction fees/speeds on the bitcoin network are ridiculously bad so it's cheaper to use cash. 
That all said, either bitcoin will solve the scaling issues and become cheap again or some other blockchain that scaled will work the same. The future of commerce is bright for the 3rd world.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:03:52
Yeah it, I agree that bitcoin is becoming more like a commodity and the current situation with transaction fees/times aren't helping it become cash. But that doesn't mean it can't be money as well. In fact in order for it to ever become stable it would need to be a commodity first.
It's like saying gold, silver, and copper can't be used as "money" because its a commodity, which would be silly considering those things have been minted and used as a medium of exchange tons of times in history.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:32:57
Maybe a bit hyperbolic. But it would definitely have a large effect in the short term given how many exchanges use it as their USD pair. It would basically stop all USD/crypto pairs accross several exchanges. But you never know, that could actually inflate the price of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:51:20
2 things
1) even if bitcoin fails to scale it can still be traded and used as "digital gold"/commodity whilst other more technically advanced cryptos or even just third party services where you just "top up" your credit/debt cards with bitcoin once or twice a month. I'm sure most people would generally be okay with handing small amounts of their bitcoin over to centralized services like this considering they do it all the time.
2) I have my doubts about bitcoin scaling but I wouldn't say it's doomed by any means. The tech is still in it's infancy.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:10:03
Gold not so much, but silver and copper is still used as currency. A quick google check and the coins of my national currency are 50% silver.
Although they have been phasing out the smaller denominations of coins because it costs more than they are worth to produce. So ironically it's because metals are such a good store of value relative to the fiat currency that the metal that is used, is worth more than the amount of fiat the coins represent. So if anything this shows that metal(a commodity) is a better currency because it's a better store of value. Logically speaking, a physical coin can never be worth less than the metal it is printed on,  but it can be worth more. But if you believe bitcoin is a better store of value than gold then you have a pretty strong argument to use it as currency. Even if you are forced to use centralized payment services to use it as an everyday currency.
**TL;DR:** inflation
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:47:30
Yes, because microsoft, virgin, tesla, expedia, overstock, and millions of other businesses and people totally use monopoly money on a daily basis to conduct commerce. /s
Just because bitcoin is volatile, and just because you don't like bitcoin, doesn't mean it's not used as a medium of exchange. Even if it [currently] has undesirable aspects compared to other "traditional" forms of payment, doesn't mean it's not a currency.
 **Medium of exchange = currency**

I would call it's growth anything but "steady". Explosive is much more accurate. It's a cycle booms and busts falling to a "higher low" each time. Be careful in believing that this isn't part of the bubble cycle, that belief could burn you.
This is coming from someone whose been through two of them already. 
Bitcoin also has a history of bubbling up 10-30x and then crashing. I don't think this is going to be any different. The only question is, are we at the beginning or the end of this bubble?
In my opinion, we still have a ways to go before the top.

Institutional investors can get in at any time, the slight tax advantage probably isn't worth the risk of missing out on the tons of profit. 


My grandma invests and handles her own funds and she has no reason to buy bitcoin, she doesn't know or care what it is. The big missing piece is lack of available places to use crypto IRL. I would use 100% crypto if I could.

Yes coins are needed to incentive actors in the network to secure it properly. But that doesn't mean Bitcoin needs to be  or around in 10 years. Ethereum or a number of other currencies could replace.

I'd like the author to run his analysis but only using data prior from early 2016 and earlier to see if this model is as or more accurate than polls or average "expert" price predictions taken around the same time.
I suspect it isn't.
Also it assumes some sort of predictability in network growth. Which it isn't. Also there is likely to be an interdependent  relationship between network growth and price. So one isn't necessarily the master of the other.
The price could increase a bit by pure random chance, which then causes more people to be interested and buy more thus increasing the fundamental network usage. A feed back loop. This is kind of the idea of [reflexivity]( You could certainly have situations in which Bitcoin seems over priced because of low network activity while in reality the price is pulling the activity up to match it and vice versa.  
Given the wild price swings just this year I don't think anyone can say with such certainty the true value of the network, perhaps the true best fit curve actually has bitcoin under priced right now and it should be 50k even for this relatively "low" amount of activity.

Yes, it's all about the concept of antifragile systems, not even specifically economics. But it's almost more of a philosophy book. In fact Taleb seems to have a distaste for modern economic theories and doesn't believe it's a valid science.
Taleb also makes the distinction between robust and antifragile, claiming that they are not the same thing. 
Fragile = porcelain teacup 
Robust = metal teacup
Antifragile = [vibranium]( teacup
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:46:09
I just finished reading Antifragile by Nicolas Taleb.
I can't believe how perfectly bitcoin fits his definition of an antifragile system. For example, the price started to crash at least in part because transaction fees were way to high and the network couldn't handle that volume. But finally segwit and lightning have been activated. So a correction and volatility actually contributed to the overall improvement of the system, this is by definition almost the opposite of the traditional banking system.
According to Taleb, the current debt based economy is fragile and all it will take for it to unravel is a small shock.
What a lot of new bitcoiners don't understand is Bitcoin was designed for financial crisis, it has never seen a downturn since it's creation whilst at the same time the infrastructure for institutions to jump in is now there. If the economy crashes then the past few months will have just been a bear trap for the bitcoin mega bubble.

[He also has some pretty obvious connections to the fossil fuel industry and has some payments from propaganda organizations that are funded by the Kochs and Wilks families.]( And he denies man made climate change, or at the very least is a merchant of doubt. That alone is enough reason to dismiss him. A respectable scientist would know to stay in their lane on topics they are not experts in, Peterson doesn't understand that climate science and almost all fields that study climate to some extent are "hard sciences" and aren't up for as much interpretation as social sciences, nor is he qualified to be making claims about it, either that or he's a sell out.

If it sends us back to the stone age you have bigger problems than money.
As long as a small portion of the electrical grid and internet survives Bitcoin will.

Doesn't lightning also drastically reduce energy costs of the network too?

I don't think anyone is saying Patreon or Paypal should be forced to host anyone. They are private and I totally support their right to deplatform people even if I think it's retarded.
I also support content creators right to use trustless payment systems like Bitcoin. These companies are going to learn the hard way how much of a threat cryptocurrency is to their business model.

Never said you specifically did, but that's often what JP fans do when he's criticized.


Because this is a scientific issue, JP pretends that he's super scientifically informed on the topic but then [references known and debunked climate deniers/skeptic like Bjorn Lomberg as "genius"]( and often posts links to known climate denial blogs.
It would be different if it was an off the cough remark here or there in an interview, but its not. Every few weeks he tweets links to some climate denialist propaganda, as a "man of science" he should be able to tell the difference, [furthermore he claims to have expertise on the subject and to have worked on the U.N. Panel for Climate Change, this is a bold faced lie.](
Furthermore he has accepted payments from "PragerU" and other organizations that are largely funded by the Fossil Fuel industry. [Two of PragerU's largest donors are the hydraulic fracturing billionaires Dan and Farris Wilks. Two members of the Wilks family are on PragerU's board. The organization has a $10 million annual budget, of which it spends more than 40% on marketing.](


Says the man whose defending a Psychologists interpretation of evidence over literally 95%+ of the scientific community. Peterson MIGHT be able to speak about topics relating to social sciences with some authority, but he is full of shit when it comes to climate change.
Climate change is the new "evolution" for ill-informed faux-conservatives that want to deny the obvious.
I mean do you really think Peterson knows more about climate change than fucking NASA?
And to answer your question, yes humans are causing rapid changes to the environment which not only will destroy our habitat but will be extremely costly to the economy. The science is far more settled on this issue than anything in the entirety of JPs field of psychology, much fewer issues with replication of studies ect. If you believe the studies that Peterson references in psychology such as "rats playing" at face value, then you should do the same for climate change because the evidence is far more clear.
[Even the U.S. government has released a report stating that climate change will cost the economy hundreds of billions in damages by the end of the century.]( But of course that is likely to be too optimistic.

Lmao, parroting Petersons vernacular? Nice dog whistle.
You won't even look at the other links because you know Petersons views are a joke on this subject but you can't accept it because you idolize him too much.

You do know that there are trading bots constantly scanning reddit comments for sentiment analysis and then making trades based off that?

lmao, you mean known merchant of doubt [Bjorn Lomborg](


Even in Denmark he's a joke.
