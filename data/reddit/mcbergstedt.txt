Bro, you gotta take some pre-workout and then pump that iron while you daytrade.

My mom's friend asked me if I should invest in Bitcoin and ethereum right in mid December and I told them to for it. 
I feel a little bad about it but I'm no financial advisor.

I can also run doom on my Android via 3rd party installation. Doesn't mean the device is compromised. 
You can also put custom firmware on ledgers. You just can't get the private keys off them ever with the original firmware. 
Not a fan of McAfee but this is FUD if you can't get the private keys off

Edit: got him and Ver mixed up/combined
He is trying to get people to think he’s Satoshi (the creator of bitcoin) even though it’s definitely not him. The media isn’t helping with it because they did a piece on him back in like 2016 saying he could be Satoshi. Satoshi was either Japanese or a weeb and was against corporatization of BTC and also didn’t want to become famous. 
He created Bitcoin SV (another shitty fork of BTC) 
He’s also currently suing people for Libel because they talked shit about him on Twitter. 
He’s basically the False Prophet of the Bitcoin scene.

So from my understanding, there was a big heist with Eth a few years ago and to "fix" it, they hard forked Eth and made the fork the new Eth to keep the hackers from getting everyone's money. 
I'm guessing it's more of a situational thing, where Eth was forked to save millions, and BTC was forked because they wanted to paint the elephant that is bitcoin gold and call it faster.

I'm really interested in seeing where the tech goes in the next decade. Decentralized games, phones, computers, new types of viruses, etc.

Cool land all but pointless until you can spend BTC at the locations you're in

I'd probably blow 60% of it asap so I could get 6 cars into my 12 car garage

I doubt it'll be like that. I do see it being a thing during elections though.

I heard it might go to 1 gazillion with bitcoin at $1,000,000. Trust me I've been a pro at this since last November

Yeah. Some places are also limiting how many GPUs you can buy. Usually only one per customer.

The whole BCH issue probably couldn't be avoided. They only had three coins at the time, and being one of the biggest exchanges adding a fourth would've messed things up regardless of if they announced it prior or randomly dropped it

I'd say it's partially because of it. People pulling out just in case the market goes bottom-up
