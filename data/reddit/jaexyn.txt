Understood. Still new around these parts. Thanks for actually explaining it and not just responding in a rude manner like some others.

Unless you have coins other than BTC and ETH that you want to move...

As is BitStamp which is where I was heading since they do more than just BTC and ETH (which I have none of).

If I understand it right, when coins are in cold storage, they don't increase (or decrease) in the value with the times. This means you're potentially losing out on all those gains (yes, and possible losses), correct? Doesn't seem worth it to me, but then I don't have that much invested.

Good old Joan Callamezzo losing her sh!t there lol

Technically, you're correct. And yes, that's the best kind of correct. I just meant the bigger guys: Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin.
I'm still very new to all this so they're the main ones I watch at the moment.

Everything dropped! If people get into this world not expecting to lose their ass one day, they've made a mistake lol. I oddly find it fun to check the sites a few times a day to see where my money lays.

I just learned about this one due to the decreases from the others I'm in on. I use Coinbase as my wallet/buying platform but they won't be dealing with BCC until January next year. 
Any recommendations on a place to pick up some BCC in the meantime?
Edit: abbreviations fixed
