To all of you   thank you very much for your guidances, I finally found out ‘bitcoin file’. Is to delete it (209GB) for saving space better or can it be moved to an external driver(512GB) for continuing loading &amp; synchronizing?

Ok, I’ll follow your guidance to check it, if can’t work out, I will leave msg to you again. Thank you again! I go to bed now, goodnight ��

Thank you very much for your kind advice. I haven’t finished the whole wallet downloading and installing it, because hardware hasn’t enough space, the downloading and synchronising stops automatically, thus , the occupied hardware space can’t be released or deleted, and I haven’t sent bitcoin into it. ☹️☹️
Do you have any good idea? Thanks again!

To: @ egodigtus,  and  thank you very much for all of you!Under all you guys kind guidances, I finally founded out ‘Bitcoin file’ that unfinished loading and synchronizing(occupied 201.95GB). So, what I do I do next? is to move it to TRASH and delete it or better to move it to an external driver (521GB) and continuing loading and synchronizing? waiting for your next advice, thanks!
