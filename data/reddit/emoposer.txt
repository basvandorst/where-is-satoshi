Words can't describe how much I hate government.

To be fair the USD is doing really, really well. Since everything is traded against the USD that makes everything seem like it's doing shit. Obviously, currencies have ups and downs but since there is no limit to the how many USD can be created, inflation is inevitable.

Technological progress and mass production are almost entirely private sector ideas. NASA buys stuff from SpaceX because it can manufacture stuff NASA has spent decades working on, cheaper.

Not sure what this has to do with Bitcoin but international trade is always awesome.

Of course inflation isn't a good thing and our current currency system with the federal reserve and Washington spending continental GDPs worth of money in a matter of months the dollar in the long term is fucked. 
Inflation adjusted everything from vacuums to tvs to pcs to napkins are actually cheaper. Not surprisingly, highly subsidized/regulated industries (healthcare, education, food) have gone up in cost, by a shitton. Just goes to show the power of market competition.

Now I can use Bitcoin to buy gas...if PSO isn't rationing like it usually is! Pakistan has a shortage of ALL energy, natural gas, gasoline, electricity, you name it. The assholes in government wont allow any private companies to come in and produce energy because the supply is controlled by mafia and low supply/high demand = a lot of money for these corrupt cunts. If Pakistan was to adopt a totally free market, if any of these Asian giants on the verge of booming would they would become great countries, but it looks like it will have to be done by avoiding government off the main market rather than government just making transactions easier.

What do you mean monopolization? In the West or in Pakistan? Pakistan heabily deregulated mobile service and allowed a lot of competition, now there is Zong, Warid, ufone, telenor, mobolink, 
The point is, it was the competition that brought prices down so much, there isn't really a monopoly at all.

Still, we're number two that's something to be proud of!

Crap, that's unfortunate. I'm in Philly and it's perfect. I acrually live in and NH and it's pretty good there too.

Yes, I get what he was saying but I was thinking he might have been under the notion (like many are) that government monopolies are a good way of lowering prices while improcing service, like it worked so well with healthcare. Dialysis is waaayy cheaper than Lasik ;)
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:02:18
Exactly, it's not cheaper in your taxes, it's not cheaper for people who do pay out of pocket, it's not cheaper at all. The money is just shuffled around more but the total cost and the impact of that cost is insane. 
We want a system where competition drives prices down for consumers, not one that results in long weight times and all of the pork that is in medicine right now. Get government out, the more people pay out of pocket, the better. 
Private medicine is actually illegal in Canada but my uncle paid a surgeon using bitcoin to avoid the 8 months he would have had to wait for a bypass. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:38:52
Well yeah it's illegal but it saved his life and he wasn't really in a condition to fly to the U.S. or somewhere else where he could get private medicine legally.

A.k.a a lack of corruption because the only area where government has power is when there is a victim, a real victim. Viloent acts, fraud, etc. Government shouldn't controll every damn aspect of your life and thanksbto bitcoin it can't control my money! Anarchy with law and order is actually Libertarianism. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:18:34
Here is a more realistic example of pricing  still dirt cheap. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 02:56:30
And it shows us that Anarchy with law and order is the best system!

T-Mobile is really starting to kick ass, I'm with them and am really satisfied. My cousin is up in Regina, SK (he also uses this account), he tells me the situation is even worse up there. There are a few places with good local competition but because the government recently started allowing real foreign competition, the big 3 still have a lot of Sway (Rogers, Telus and Bell). If Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, etc. any of these American guys were allowed in Canada they would build up XLTE infrastructure and lower prices a lot.

It's okay you can use the mirror link, all you have to do is go on a porn website and click on those links that promise to make your penis bigger. They are just as legit and you will get similar adware/malware. ha ha

That video made your day but a 4 inch penis increase and 500 BTC/hr didn't?

I think the modern version would be more like this:
HELLO MY NAME IS JOHN DOE, AM I AMERICAN BUSSINES MAN AND MY AUNT IS MAKING 50 BTC/HR WORKING FROM HER HOMES!! THIS IS POSSIBLE FOR ANYBODIES! JUST SIGNING UP AT 
based on the numerous youtube comments I have read.

I much more enjoyed the forum in Braavos.

Bitcoin is a much better alternative.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:08:57
That number is the minimum price Bitcoin would have to get to before Bitcoin holders would start selling. Once they start selling, but external forces maintain the demand at an increased level, the increase in quantity supplied would create an equilibrium at  $196,165.79.

You could have ended the title before "about bitcoin" and it would have been even more accurate.

Yes, it can. The whole point of the video is to show how it makes it easier and cheaper for people in developing countries to receive money from abroad.
