Not that bad, there will be a price drop to possibly 1200-1500 (or less) and that will be THE shitshow, however that will get most greedy investors out of the game for a short time and it will let the ecosystem out of speculation for a while after the crash (which will be good).

Why does everyone want to reduce miner income even though you barely make over the amount that electricity costs?
I don't understand this part, yeah you can reduce it but if you do so you will rely on big corporations only and they can abandon ship and crash your economy if things seem dire.

Don't listen to this kaiser guy, anyone who understands tech knows that this will be A SHITSHOW.
How do i know? Because let's take a look at something as simple as CSS, Firefox and Chrome cannot come to an agreement on how to display it so they just fuck everyone's life for it.
Yes, if the guys in charge of displaying the web cannot come to an agreement do you really expect some assholes who invested into bitcoin to gain profit to not want to have even more profit? Each will invest in what they think will benefit them the most, there is a very big possibility that there might be a split, and even if there isn't a 2x would be similarly catastrophic in the short-mid range.

You're investing on bitcoin yet you are shitting on "nerds", do you understand who is allowing your transactions to be decrypted so that they can go through?
