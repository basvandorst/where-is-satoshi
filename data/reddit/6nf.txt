Can you point me to some of these testers / tests happening on mainnet? Do you know of any serious players working on hubs?
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:55:19


The network will do all of this without Ben's node doing anything. Your node does not help. The nodes that will cut off bad miners are other miners, and the exchanges and big nodes people use for transacting to each other. Not Ben's node.
Draw me a picture that includes your node, the bad node, the miners and the exchange nodes. Then run the scenario. Next remove your node. Run the scenario again. Can you point to any difference at all in the outcome? NO!
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:15:10


Yes so if you remove Ben's node from the equation, the network will still make the same decision. Your node didn't change the outcome. The network will do what it does anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:22:17
So your home node made no difference. The network will rebuild an honest net without Ben's PC. All the network needs to do this is miners and exchange nodes.

@_date: 2018-01-03 09:34:12
You have a warped view of 'the entire point of bitcoin' and you clearly either haven't read or do not understand the whitepaper. You have no concrete example of a situation where non mining home user nodes matter.
You have no logical argument that makes any sense at all. This is not about why bitcoin is cool, this is merely a fact and the reality of how the block chain operates.
If your full node finds a block that it does not agree with, what happens exactly? Can you explain that in technical detail? How does your computer affect the rest of the network exactly? Does it send out a message to other nodes to say 'hey this block sucks'? Please explain it to me.

If Jihan attacked the network and he took over the entire thing, then that means everyone are using this new chain and that is Bitcoin. We won't care what Ben's node is doing in the corner all by itself. You can't mine blocks, and thus your chain is dead. Jihan's chain has all the miners and all the exchanges and that's all that matters. Everyone will use his chain. Not Ben's. At best the chain will split and everyone will get 2 coins. But only if there's miners on your side. Your node by itself is irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:36:26
Yea but how does that affect the rest of the network. Your home nodes cuts off comms with the bad miner but how does that affect anyone else?
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:25:26

@_date: 2018-01-03 10:24:36
What is the concrete, specific difference it made? I just showed that removing your node from the equation made zero difference in the outcome. The network will behave exactly the same without Ben's home node.
Notice that this is NOT true for miners or exchange nodes. If you remove one of those nodes there are measurable differences in the outcome.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:42:49
Let's say there's a few really big hubs, and you want to open a channel to one of them.
Let's say you want to receive money on this channel. That means the hub also has to put coin into the channel from their side, right?
How much would the hub put in your channel? They don't know what you're planning on doing, how would they work out how much to assign to your channel?
I guess you'll have to tell them right? So you say 'pls put 0.1 BTC in the channel cause I'm going to buy that much next week and I'd like to receive it using LN'
So the hub has to come up with 0.1 BTC for your channel. But they'll have to charge you for this, cause money aint free. How will they charge you? Probably a monthly fee or something I'd guess, maybe with a discount if you use the channel a lot and pay a bunch of TX fees to them.
What do you think?
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:16:54
If I'm only sending my channel will quickly get depleted and become useless. I'd have to close it and make new ones.

What's the average channel capacity?
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:44:32


That's exactly my point. The nodes that matter will find the bad actor with no help from Ben's node.
The exchanges will immediately find the bad actor and cut him off. The other miners will immediately find the bad miner and cut him off. Ben's node might as well not exist.

LN will be great! Can’t wait to lock up a bunch of coin into a channel at huge cost to myself making it unavailable for normal transactions. Woo hoo! Such a great solution. I love having my private key hot and online for hackers to steal. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:27:57
Your node did not disconnect Jiran from the rest of the network, Jihan is still connected to everyone else unless they decide to cut him off without your input.
Consensus is determined by POW not by non-mining nodes routing blocks around.
My decision to join Jihan or not to join Jihan's side will be determined by what the exchanges and other mining nodes do, not by what Ben's node does. Ben's node does not come into play when I'm making this decision.

No it's not. Nobody out there cares what you on your personal wallet does. They only care about 
1) Miner nodes and what they do
2) Big company nodes like exchanges.
Your node doesn't make one iota of difference at all to anyone. And it's a good thing too, cause if your node mattered anyone could spin up thousands of full nodes and do bad things.
If your node just agrees with the important nodes, it doesnt matter.
If your node disagrees with the important nodes, it does not matter.

Your article is bullshit, I read it. You have no idea what you're talking about. You can't even give me an example of when your full node will matter in any circumstances. For literally any scenario you can come up with, you'll find that removing your full non mining node from the equation will never change the outcome.
Keep downvoting me if it makes you feel better.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:42:38
Miners have power on the network because they decide which rules to use and which chain to add blocks to.
Exchanges have power because they decide which chain to follow so people can buy and sell coins giving that chain value.
Everyone else have power because they decide which exchanges to use and which coins to buy and sell on that exchange on the different chains.
Everyone else can run nodes or not run nodes at home and the network would not be affected at all.

Cutting itself off the bad node on the network makes no difference for the rest of the network. Nobody cares what your node does.
Explain to me who will be affected by your node in this situation? There's not a single other node that will care what your node does. They only care about themselves, and the miners, and the business nodes. Not your random home node. If you take all home nodes away the security does not change.
Explain it to me in terms of a realistic situation where your node made an actual measurable difference. Use numbers or something measurable.
Let's say something happens where your node disagrees with another node. Now take away your node. How does the outcome change? If your node didn't exist, exactly what would change? How would it change?
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:05:08

Your LN channel node runs on your computer. Or perhaps your phone. You can't do 2FA cause it's just your computer. If your computer gets hacked you are screwed, the hackers can take it all. The LN channel must keep the Private Key 'hot' at all times cause otherwise it can't sign transactions and you can't send or receive coin nor be used as a hub to facilitate other people's transactions.
You can't put anything in cold storage without closing and re-opening the channel (i.e. you need on-chain transactions to move coin to cold storage)
That's the main problem here, and it's not something a hardware wallet can solve. For your LN node to function (send, receive or facilitate channels) it has to be operational 24/7. Of course you could take your LN node offline whenever you're not sending money but then you can't receive money either. Anytime someone tries to pay you, they will need to call you up and ask you get online. And being a middleman for other people is just off the table completely.
It'll be pretty annoying to miss out on getting paid just because you were sleeping or otherwise offline. You can't expect to wake up in the middle of the night to approve an incoming payment or watever. And you'd have to hit 'approve' within seconds otherwise the person on the other end will just get an error message saying 'no route' or whatever.

Yes but the network does not care about my node or your node or Luke's node. If the Winklevii buy bitcoin they use the chain created by miners and the chain followed by Gemini or whatever exchange they use. Even if Ben and 6nf and Luke's nodes decided that there's a bad actor, it doesn't affect the Winklevii because they just care about the block chain that their exchange and other exchanges follow. Those nodes decide which chains to follow and which blocks to mine. Not Ben or 6nf or Luke, even if all three of us disagree with Gemini and GDAX and the chinese miners.
If the miners and the exxchagnes disagree then the chain splits. If not, the chain does not split. No other nodes affect the outcome.

Thats not the whole story and you know it. 4MB is the theoretical max and can only happen in certain pathological cases. 1.6MB is more achievable but only if literally everyone on the chain starts using Segwit exclusively. 
If you double the block size, TX fees will immediately drop massively which means BTC becomes viable as a payment form again and Microsoft and Valve etc can accept it again.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:39:06

You say this like Ben's node cutting off others affects the miners or exchanges. Ben's node can only cut bad nodes off from Ben's node. It can't cut bad nodes off from exchanges or from miners cause those nodes make their own decisions that does not take Ben's node into consideration at all. The cutting will happen just fine without Ben's node in the picture. Potential blocks are routed to all nodes and these blocks will get routed to all nodes with or without Ben's node.

But what your personal full node does is 100% irrelevant to the miners and the rest of the network. You're not making any sense. Blocks are not 'encrypted' by a POW that blah blah, where do you get this from?
Your wallet  can validate whatever it wants but it has no effect on the rest of the network.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:42:22


Yes but then you can't receive money or act as a hub. People need to know this.


We tell everyone to use hardware wallets or paper wallets for this reason. If I have a paper or hardware wallet I can still receive coin at any time. Not possible with LN, I need to actually be online at the moment the coin is sent to me which sucks for many use cases.


That doesn't help. A hacker won't close your channel. He just makes a payment to his own address using all the remaining funds in your channel.


If you open a LN channel with only $100 in it, and you have to pay $15 to open that channel, that's pretty sucky. You can't buy anything worth more than $100 at a time and the 15% fee is crazy.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:15:59
If LN takes off, bigger hubs will have an advantage over smaller hubs (fewer hops = smaller fees) so hubs will tend to centralize over time.

Yes it is true, no nodes are going offline today because of a few 8MB blocks. If you know of any please tell me but from monitoring the network I can't see anyone going offline so stop with the bullshit.
BCH supporters don't believe that fee paying transactions are 'spam'. They are just transactions. If the miners felt they weren't worth mining they wouldn't mine them, simple as that.
Kicking the rock down the road until you have better tools to deal with it is better than falling over the rock today because you don't have better tools to deal with it.

@_date: 2018-01-03 23:43:04
LN is super complicated compared to on-chain transactions. Random home gamers are going to fuck it up and lose money.
In my view the biggest risk is having your PK online while your channel is open. That means if your computer get pwned, your PK can be stolen and you'll get robbed.
With a normal Bitcoin wallet I can generate a PK and address offline and receive payments with zero risk cause there's no way a russian hacker can get my private key of my offline cold wallet.
Large exchagnes and payment processors use cold wallets extensively to reduce risk. If they need those private keys 'hot' at all times there will be some pretty stressed out security staff!

@_date: 2018-01-03 10:13:13
But it only cuts it away from itself. Cutting a connection between Ben's node and Evil Jim's node does not change anything in the network (compare this to a situation where your node doesn't even exist in the first place, how is the network any different? It's not)
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:10:37
No it can't, do you know what a non mining node actually does? It can't force other nodes to cut off anyone, and in fact it can't even suggest to other nodes that 'hey this is bad lets cut this guy'
Your node can only cut connections from itself to other nodes. The rest of the network does not rely on your node. Your node can disappear or start cutting or do whatever it wants and it would not affect a single other person or node in the world.
The only nodes that DO have people or nodes rely on them are mining nodes and big business nodes. Not your node. Nobody relies on your node. Nobody listens to your node. Only you.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:41:17
I'm guessing most random small time users like myself will just connect to one hub and hopefully that hub will be connected to everyone else. So I'm not valuable as a routing path.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:03:57


Only for yourself. Nobody else listens to you. You can cut whatever you want and the network will route around you.
If your actions are correct, the rest of the network will make the same decision without you, so therefore you are not making a measurable difference.
There is no situation here where your home node can affect any outcomes.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:57:37
This is a chain split, that's just some miners and exchanges deciding to change the rules. It worked because people wanted to use that chain. It didn't matter how many people on the BTC side or on the BCH side ran non mining nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:40:19
It only cuts invalid nodes off itself. Ben's node will only break connections from itself to the bad node. The bad node can still connect to anyone who will let it and this process does not care what Ben's node is doing. Those other nodes will make up their own minds and they matter because they are exchanges or miners. That's their power. Their power does not come from being able to disconnect bad nodes. Their power comes from mining blocks or from selling or buying coins between users on the chain that they decide to follow. Ben's power comes from deciding which exchange he uses to buy and sell Bitcoin. Ben's power does not come from his node disconnecting or connecting to other nodes.

That works, the only problem is that the sender needs to have 0.1BTC that is NOT locked into a channel.
Cause if it doesn't it will have to close another channel first which is a bunch more in fees.
So if my friend Tommy wants to pay me and Tommy's coins are all in channels, he will have to close something first even though he has a bunch of coin available (but stuck in LN)
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:23:55
No, you are wrong. The security comes from the miners. If miners agree then they keep mining Bitcoin blocks. If they disagree then some of them will start a new chain. In this whole process not one person cares what Ben Harper is running on his personal PC. If you think this you are deluded. If there was not a single non mining full node anywhere except the exchanges and business, nothing would be different. Nothing at all.
That's literally the whole point of Bitcoin - miners keep the network secure. Read the whitepaper or whatever I dont know. 
How many other coins are telling their users to run 'full non mining nodes' for the security of the network? Zero.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:23:22
But you JUST said that 'nothing' would be different?

Who your wallet cuts or does not cut will in no way affect the network. It wil not affect the next block being mined. It will not affect what chain the exchanges follow. It will not affect which chain the payment processors use.
They are perfectly capable of verifying the chain all by themselves. They don't care if you do it too. Nobody cares. Nodes that matter ALREADY validates every single block by themselves. They don't need you to do it too, and if youdecide to do it too they don't care what your findings are.
If you look at the Bitcoin code you'll find there's not even a mechanism by which they could care what you find. IT literally does not make any difference to anyone but yourself.

That's true in some cases but it's possible that the opponent has zero risk - if your channel is depleted and they don't owe you anything then they have nothing to lose by trying to cheat you by resending an old outdated TX.

The miners and exchanges already has an immutable record of the block chain, they don't need your home node's copy. A 51% attack does not destroy any previously mined blocks.

This I agree with. Using the chain is NOT running a node at home though. Using the chain is 1) mining and 2) making transactions. 
Mining is not possible for Ben and making transactions does not require Ben to run a full node.

That paper talks about saving blockchain space using channel factories and rebalancing, it doesn't address the issue of what a hub has to charge a user to fund a new channel.
Regardless of how you structure the hubs and channels you still need someone to commit coins to the last hop - from the hub / factory to the user.
Some people are estimating ongoing fees of maybe 2-3% per year to keep such a channel open. Personally I don't think it would be worth the effort for a hub to only get 2-3% on their money so I'm expecting more than that.
Do you know of any commercial hub startups working on being the first hubs? I haven't been able to find any.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:57:24
So if I have a channel open but I'm not connected 24/7, does that mean I have to trust my hub not to screw me over?
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:35:13
Which hub would you like MS and Valve to connect to when they implement LN?

So if BTC used GPU mining then somehow non mining nodes will cease to matter? That's not how Bitcoin works.
I refuse your argument because it is wrong. Miners secure the network against 51% attacks, and people making transactions determine the value of the coins on that network.
Non mining nodes do nothing.

But HOW does it affect other nodes? You still have not been able to give my one legitamite real world situation where Ben's home node affects other nodes, affects the block chain, or anything. You're just wasting your time validating stuff that everyone else already validates for themselves.

Google says an Antminer S9 can do maybe $20 per day in profit right now so your friend's numbers are probably correct.
Problem is of course that the S9 is going for around $7 000 at the moment and even if you buy one it could take weeks or months to ship.
At that rate it will take a looooong time to pay for themselves. If you take into consideration that the difficulty is increasing all the time it could literally be years, if ever.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:51:54
They're not really in that business. If a payment processor does it for them then they will use it but at this stage I don't think Valve is interested in hiring a bitcoin dev just for some payments.

Keeping money in a channel is not actually free, since you can't use that money for anything else while it's in the channel. So it costs money to keep a channel running. Indirectly, but still.
Therefore channel hubs will tend to centralise over time because bigger hubs have an advantage over smaller ones (fewer hops to send money)
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:16:32
No, you can't route around this problem since the issue is with the last hop - Alice's link to the LN is now full and the only way for Alice to receive more money is to have a new channel opened.

Satoshi's words:
*My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it's locked in and we're stuck with it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that's very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it'll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there's only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000. There's plenty of granularity if typical prices become small. For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it's now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.*

Wanna put some money on this? Cause it's pretty obvious to me that this is crap. Too many countries are beyond the reach of the governments trying to fuck it up.

Yes, the only thing you should also consider is the max block size. Once blocks start hitting the size limit regularly transactions with the smallest fees will get dropped in favour of more profitable ones.

Let's say you're a bullion company in a country with 20% VAT. You buy silver from some other company for $100 and in the process you pay them $20 in VAT.
Now you sell it to some guy for $150 plus $30 in VAT.
When tax time comes around you owe the govt $30 - $20 which is $10 in VAT. That's the same as 20% of the added $50. Hence 'value added tax'. It's about the dollar value added to the sale price in this case.

Classic doesn't have code yet because it's still working out what most of the mining crowd wants to support. They are taking it slowly and talking to those with the power to actually make a hard fork happen. It's still early days. But at least Classic is asking miners what they want instead of unilaterally deciding on their behalf!
@_date: 2017-02-27 03:08:12
Nodes can't force adoption when 70% of miners still don't support segwit, this won't work.

Classic has the support of most miners, I would not call it a fringe altcoin 
@_date: 2016-01-23 15:21:03
Ummm Core is against increasing the block size. The entire point of Classic is increasing the block size. That's literally the only thing Classic wants - to increase the block size!
@_date: 2017-02-27 03:15:36
If only 30% of miners support SW then it will take over 3 times longer to get a SW transaction into a block. Which means nobody will make SW transactions. Which means it won't work.

That's not correct, he chose the 21 million. Here's his words:
*My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it's locked in and we're stuck with it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that's very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it'll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there's only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000. There's plenty of granularity if typical prices become small. For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it's now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.*

1MB forever and ever?


@_date: 2018-02-25 22:54:56
Let me try again:
If I want to route a transaction over the network, I need to know all (or most) of the network. I need to know which nodes are connected to which other nodes and how much funds are available in those channels. I need to know the amount of funds in each channel because it must be bigger than the amount I'm trying to send. Then I can use this information to find the cheapest route.
But this network is changing all the time, every transaction changes the amount of funds in these channels. So when I make a transaction, the rest of the network needs to know about it so they can adjust the 'available' amount for those channels. So every transaction must be communicated (and if you look at the LN implementation this is in fact what they are doing) to every node on the network.
Does that make sense? If not I can expand some more
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:47:53

There's literally less than 1000 people in the entire world running LN on mainnet, and as far as anyone knows only 3 online stores use it for one or two test products. If there's a grocery store taking it already even though the LN creators themselves are telling people not to use it yet, that's pretty big news and you need to post some pics of this amazing store and maybe interview the owners to see what they say about LN

Sorry what is an 'LN wallet' if not a node? Your LN funds cannot operate (e.g. receive coin) if it's not hot with your PK on your computer. You can turn off your LN node but then it cant receive any coin to it (or send or act as a hop in a channel)
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:23:04
Sorry there's no such thing as a 'LN wallet', it's the same thing as a node. If you put money into a LN channel you have a LN node. All participants on the LN network are equal. There's no separate 'wallet' and 'node'.

Eh? What makes you think that I (or anyone else for that matter) can time a market crash?
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:57:18
Are you currently running LN?
I do know what I'm talking about. If you don't believe me that's on you. The LN software signs transactions without user interaction and it needs to be able to do that to receive coin or act as a hop in a channel for someone else. You can't hit 'approve' on your hardware device in the 500 miliseconds it takes to negotiate a route or transfer so it has to happen without user interaction.
With regular on-chain transactions you do not need to sign anything when receiving coin. With LN you do. On-chain receiving can happen to a cold wallet. With LN it can not.

@_date: 2018-02-19 03:04:17
Yes but what I'm saying is that if you had a password on sending money you will not be able to act as a hop for someone else on the network. 
Also you will not be able to receive money cause it's the same private key being used for both sending and receiving money. If you only ever send money on LN you'll quickly run out of funds in your channel.

@_date: 2018-02-19 03:35:22
Look if you password protect LN properly, what you're doing is encrypting the LN private key used to sign transactions. If you're not encrypting the LN private key, hackers will be able to get to it and drain your funds. Just having a password in the app is no protection at all against a hacker with access to your machine.
The same LN PK used to send money is also used to receive money. so there's no way to properly protect one but not the other.

Like I said those wallets are just nodes with a different name. They can not receive payments while offline. If your PC is hacked those wallets will be drained. Those wallets do not support hardware dongles like Trezor or whatever. If your phone or PC gets hacked and you have one of those wallets, the hacker will take everything in them.
Here's a test you can do: Install one of those wallets, open a channel to LN, and turn off your phone. See if you can send coin to that wallet while your phone is disconnected from the internet.

To open and operate a channel on LN, your Private Key must be 'hot' at all times otherwise you can't send or receive coin, nor act as a hop in someone else's route. So if your PC gets hacked you will lose all the funds in your LN channels.
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:30:30
Sorry but if your PC gets hacked you will definitely lose all the coin in your LN channels. Your LN node can not send or receive coin without signing the intermediate transactions in real time. Also to act as a hop in someone else's channel your node needs to sign both incoming and outgoing transactions with your key.
This same key can be used to send everything you have to anyone else on LN making it dead simple for a hacker to steal all your LN funds.

The problem is that every transaction on the network changes the amount of funds available on several hops and this new information needs to be transmitted to every other node on the network because it affects their routing possibilities. So once you get to thousands of transactions and millions of nodes you quickly hit the limits with the sheer amount of information being sent around.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:28:23

CC is better because:
- You can reverse the charge if your goods do not turn up
- Your CC company charges you nothing and in fact gives you incentives (miles / rewards) to use the CC
- If your CC gets stolen you will lose no money, just cancel it and get a new one
- You get 30 or 60 days interest free time to pay off your CC, no need to fund it up-front
CC is worse in these ways:
- Can't use it for illegal goods
- Not everyone qualifies for a credit card

@_date: 2018-02-04 08:35:50
There's no requirement to run a full node (Bitcoin node with the whole block chain etc) in order to run a lightning node.  They are two different things. A LN node just needs to have access to other LN nodes, it does not need to know what's in the entire Bitcoin block chain.
Have you read the LN whitepaper? There's no mention of two different types of network participants - all actors on LN are nodes.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:48:46


This is what we're talking about. That software runs on your PC. To 'populate the path' as you describe it, your computer needs to know what the network looks like - which nodes are online, which nodes they are connected to, and how much funds are available in those channels.
The question is how does your PC get all this information? You either need to query all the nodes on the LN network and get them to report this info back to you, or you need all the nodes on the network to constantly send you updates as their channel balances change. 
The current LN implementation does the second option but that does not scale beyond about a few hundred transactions per minute. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:30:11
You literally get insured against that stuff by your CC company, and it's very very easy. I've had to do it a few times and there was zero 'hardship'. If this is a concern you can get a single use CC number too.

Buy an old computer with no sound card, no network, no wifi, no bluetooth, and no hard drive.
Boot from a Linux Live CD. Write your own key generator from scratch. Enter several thousand random numbers generated from a true random source such as a radioactive decay geiger counter.
Write down the private key by hand on acid-free archival paper and no-fade ink pen. Make sure your windows are closed and no cameras or spy equipment nearby.
Destroy the computer and monitor immediately afterwards using a high temperature furnace.
Cover the private key with plastic and a thin sheet of metal so it can't be read using exotic methods.
Do all of this in a faraday-shielded room.
Now you can send coins to your new address with a fair shot at not getting stolen.

The existing segwit signalling nodes will only activate segwit once a large majority of other miners signal segwit. They don't give a fuck about 1 Aug or the UASF.
The actual number is 1916 blocks out of the last 2016 must signal segwit before any of them will activate. UASF will do nothing. The miners will follow the chain with the most work and that is certainly not going to be the UASF chain. They do not see the chains as being equal. They seek the longest one.

You are correct, malicious miners can try to orphan the block but they'd probably need to mine TWO blocks in a row to succeed which is pretty risky unless you have a large section of hashing power. There's probably some break-even 0 EV point for attempting this in terms of your hashing muscle. 
Example: If you attempt to orphan their block and you fail, you lose 25BTC. If you succeed you gain 85BTC. Therefore you'd need about 30% of global hash power to break even with this stunt I think? Of course I'm ignoring some important details here but you get the picture.

They've already made some mistakes that would get them into serious trouble in a regulated market.

This is wrong. I don't know where you got this idea but it's 100% wrong. Barter transactions and transactions using money other than USD is STILL TAXED AT THE SAME RATE. Ask your local tax accountant if you don't believe me. 


Wrong again, if you exchange that bitcoin for something else (e.g. a new TV or whatever) you still get taxed for the $900 profit you made based on the market value of either the bitcoin you spent or the item you purchased. Same as barter transactions currently. Same as transactions in silver or platinum or whatever currently.


Wrong, capital gain is measured in USD not whatever you feel like. All that matters to the IRS is what your shit is worth in USD.

*Speculation is the practice of engaging in risky financial transactions in an attempt to profit from short or medium term fluctuations in the market value of a tradable good such as a financial instrument, rather than attempting to profit from the underlying financial attributes embodied in the instrument such as capital gains, interest, or dividends.*
Buying stocks to keep long term and earn dividends is investing
Buying commodities or currencies that will never earn any dividends or other income is speculation.
