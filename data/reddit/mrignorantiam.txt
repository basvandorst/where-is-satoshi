Fibonacci =/= actual analytics. Keep it simple with dollar cost averaging and use bollinger bands for entry pts. Fibonacci’s arbitrary sequence won’t help you here.

That looks fantastic! imho, there's something about using bitcoin that makes any purchase feel satisfying. I recently pulled a handsome profit from LUN, so a rad lunch might just be in order.

You can use debit cards now with Bitcoin. Shift Payments works with Coinbase accounts. 
Edit: Xapo is another with a debit card.

I have a ledger nano s. Their applications run via chrome and is fairly intuitive (i'm no programmer). I had no issues during the btc/bch split. The only negative: The device kept freezing during setup in the pin entry stage. A few hard resets and it worked. I have no experience with trezor. Another alternative may be paper wallets if you want to cold storage for a while.

Good thing there's competition in the Bitcoin Visasphere.

+$1000 in less than a week. A healthy correction is upon us, lads.

This is sound advice and needs to be higher. I've been approached by too many people within the last month who don't have an emergency fund yet are asking how to "invest" in bitcoin. Please, hodl responsibly.

The [white paper]( introduces a specific problem within the executive summary.

I'll stick to my tea leaves and bird bones, thank you.

**But the dollar is not government controlled. The Fed is a private bank.**
Not to mention the incompatibilities of a fractional reserve system and a blockchain based currency. Even though the Fed has signaled their willingness for change, they won't relinquish their autonomy. The bankers who run the Fed and the private banks who are invested in the Fed would end up creating and maintaining the system.
