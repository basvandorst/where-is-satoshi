Wow! There are a lot of websites.  The gaming ones are the one that I am interested the most. Thanks!

Since it is an old spare phone, I think I can try to jailbreak it. But you said the mining apps are not worth to do it. Maybe will just forget it. Thanks for the response!

Well, last time I asked a question about earning bitcoin by playing a game such as sarutobi and someone said that I should work and buy bitcoin. That's why I did write down that PS. I do have work and bought bitcoin...
If it is seem a bit agressive I am sorry about that. I will delete it

I tried to sell but couldn't do it. No one wants to buy Iphone 5 anymore :D. Even the second hand phone seller did not buy it. One of the stores offered to take it like $5. Kinda stuck with this old pal.

Nope, I live in a dorm. I have a good computer which is like $1500. But I do not want to exhaust my gpu because all of my is done by my computer.

Well, electricity is almost free for me :). I used do it with my pc but it kills the computer after a while. So i was thinking about mining with the phone because I got a spare one.

Thanks for this brilliant response, you should be a genius :) 
I already have a job and can buy bitcoin. Also I have some BTC :)  Sarutobi was making it fun to earn bitcoin that's why I asked.

I did not have a dream about being a bitcoin rich by mining on my old phone. I used to mine with rasberry pi and on my old computer like 2-3 years ago did have a small amount of bitcoin over a certain time.
I did saw a video about mining on iphone that's why I asked you. I was not planning to build a iphone mining station.
