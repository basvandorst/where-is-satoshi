Do you ever look back and realize that for every $10k you bought in bitcoin, you coulda made 2 million in 2017 legally? Do you feel stupid for not taking the easy route by just buying and holding?

Bitcoin is at 9000 right now. By the end of 2030 it is going to be well above 1 million. You do the math. If you want to be rich, then buy some bitcoin right now on coinbase.

It's still possible to make 100x if bitcoin hits 1 million which is within reach within the next decade. So a $1000 investment today will be worth 100k in 10 years

Wanna know the funny part? Even if you did have 10k btc, you woulda sold at $500 or even less, and you still would went through depression cause you didn't sell at 20k lol...so you were fcked the moment you bought those shitcoins

Bro your mom just threw away a potential 200 million dollars LOL (if you sold at 20k in 2017)...its alright though..regardless of whether you're broke or a millionaire, you're still gonna be dead within 60 years anyway lol

Fck the banks, fck blockchain, fck fiat, even fck bitcoin..I only buy bitcoin cause it makes me money. I dont give a damn about the tech or how it could help shithole countries. All I care about is buying the dips and selling for a profit. Give me $1 million bitcoin price. I dont give a shit if its manipulated or if it tightens the elite's control over us sheep. Just give me the goddamn profits and I'm happy.
