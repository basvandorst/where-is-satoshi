I use VPN.ac.  I believe they take Bitcoin, and I haven't had any issues with them.
Of course, I did my own shopping around, and didn't bounce the idea off of first, so if I've made a horrible mistake, perhaps someone here can enlighten me.
EDIT:  Confirmed, they take Bitcoin.

Should I be looking forward to The Final Solution?

Intrinsic?  Might want to check out a dictionary.  Just sayin'.

Seems legit.

Another example of why Bitcoin will not succeed in the long run.  This subreddit is full of (presumably) some of the more knowledgeable people about Bitcoin, and yet every other post is about malware, scams, and people otherwise having their money stolen.
If the experts who know everything about how it works can't expect their money to be safe, how are the regular folks ever going to trust Bitcoin?

Certainly the best-dressed feline bitcoin user.
Since "Lemmy" (as in my username) is a cat, and I'm his daddy, and then I post a meme which depicts me as a cat, it is easy to see how one might conclude that I am, in fact, also a cat.
The truth is that I am not actually Lemmy's biological father, and the meme was selected, not for its accurate depiction of me, but as a continuation of an existing meme.
Either way, I feel welcome in this community already!

So, OP actually copy/pasted the article's title and then *added* the superfluous apostrophe?
