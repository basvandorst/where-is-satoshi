Something is up with coin base can't pull up the page.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:59:33
Same here was going to move stuff to my wallet today. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:59:56
I don't like this after that hack. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:51:24
How are you handling the taxes with this cash out. I keep seeing post like this but I never give any insight on this topic. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:02:58


I have not seen this one before dose it support most media plugins? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:33:34
I have been toying with the same idea for a while. Is there any tax things I need to know before doing something like this? Like with capitol gains taxes and what not? That is the biggest thing holding me back right now from becoming car lone and student lone dept free. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:01
ok this is somewhat scary now.

Buying the dip pays off in time don't worry. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:26:32
Humm would like to see it on Steam. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:08:05
Humm time to buy and hold is all I see. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:05:13
I don't mind busting up from where I bought in at.

Coinbase is getting hit hard. I am glad I don't have anything on them. I can't even look at the dashbord. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:07:18
Ok so if bitcoins are banned I say we use Ethereum or Wolongs. I mean lets face it some they might know there are other types but knowing lawmakers they will drop the ball and just say bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:10:35
I for one welcome a small cool off. Gives me some time to get some more.

I never fully understood how shorting stuff works. All I ever really knew was that it seemed wrong for a long time. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:54:51
We give them a lot of crap. But they keep a calm mind about things. Sometime so calm that you can not be calm and have to wait to do stuff. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:30:25
Thanks for this site. Helps put things in to perspective for those that work a somewhat dead end job with the hopes of one day being financially free. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:40:55
Yep that is the plan still waiting on the sync. I just wanted to see if anyone had any insight on this idea. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:42:20
Just got to go the bank now to get that thumb drive. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:08:41
Thanks for putting my mind at rest on the topic. I hold then move it from my exchange account only when I hit a whole bitcoin so it only has way less than 100 transactions on it. But only the wallet.dat is encrypted the program core would not know the difference correct? 
@_date: 2017-05-14 03:17:47
You have no idea how good this news is to me. I know I never used that many requests. So now I just have to sit and wait. then moved them over when I can. Thank you so much for putting my mind at rest on this. I nearly puked when I realized my mistake. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:32:59
Well mine issue was that I was poor collage student with no cash to spend. Now I have good job and I buy what I can every week.

@_date: 2018-04-15 22:52:16
I know.
@_date: 2017-05-04 02:31:40
They are also selling Litecoins so that is going to see a bump soon I bet.

Getting my Hardware wallet on the 15th. Just a quick question. Anyone have anything against Nano Ledger S? I would like the know/ 
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:30:15
I think he left in all in One Peace and in 2040 he will start letting out clues to as to where it is at. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:13:38
Enn still up by about 700$ from last month. So any new guys try to keep that in mind.

This video needs to get a major broadcast network or even just a collage TV stations, this is one of the best on how the TRUE Economy works video I have ever seen. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:18:13
I hope this dose not effect Coinbase or BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:20:34

Thank you for who ever read this. I needed to complain. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:36:49
Ha I know the risk and I want to leave the FED reserve so bad that I 
will go down with the Bitcoin ship before giving up or cashing out!
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:54:54

@_date: 2013-12-11 18:42:31

@_date: 2013-12-07 16:13:21
I am not going to trade them all for another but I betting that Lite and Namecoins will go up in value over time. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:17:06

@_date: 2013-12-08 17:28:22
