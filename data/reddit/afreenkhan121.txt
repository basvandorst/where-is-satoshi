The [price of bitcoin]( is slightly different on each exchange platform.
It is fixed by the law of supply and demand (as the vast majority of price in the world).
On each exchange platform, users offers [bitcoins to sell]( (they are free to chose the price) and users buy bitcoins (usually to the user offering the lowest price).
The price is determined by the value of the bitcoin during the last exchange.
If you look at coinmarketcap, you have the [average prices]( (the site is tracking the majority of the exchange platforms).
