Look there about BCC
Yes, it is suggested to move BTC out of exchanges before Aug 1st to be sure if chain splits - to have both coins.
So be sure not to send coins anywhere that you don't control on both chains or which is sure to credit your coins on both chains (the latter refers to exchanges that implement auto-splitting), unless you have taken (somewhat complicated) measures to 'split' your coins into separate wallets.
Be careful even if it doesn't appear that the alternate chain is succeeding. The situation may evolve over some days (or longer)
And as far as I know, you will have the same amount of BTC as you will BCC if you are using a supported wallet when the split comes. Market value will certainly fluctuate for the few days after the split.
The units will not change if you leave your coin where it is. Your coins will not magically disappear. If it is on loan, or in trades at the time, you may gain or lose depending on the exchange status.

I'm sure that Ledger Nano S is the best. 
Just look through the top of best wallets. Maybe you'll choose the good one.
Good luck.

i think you should be careful when you want to sell your bitcoin and you should choose the only recommended seller, in this forum or even in outside like localbitcoin or other site, because when you send the bitcoin amount, you can get it back if the bad thing is happen. i will give the advice for you, better you find your own friends in around you so you can feel safety when you want to sell your bitcoin, and i am sure that you can find your friends with easy like me.

Yes, it's much faster. But it still takes some searching to find places to spend your Bitcoin((
Nevertheless, the list is growing and i hope it will be legalized everywhere.

The algorithms traditionally used in bitcoin are open to everyone and can be freely used by anyone to offer the best implementation to the miners and users. The emergence of proprietary optimization, the use of which is possible only with the consent of the "owner" and with the payment of a commission, creates a rather unpleasant precedent, which can have several negative consequences.
First of all, if the community allows the introduction of proprietary and proprietary elements into the core processes of bitcoin, the system will gradually be taken out of public space, and its critical components will become overgrown with "masters" who will profit from their use by other users.
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:05:16
Don't worry. I believe that bitcoin will be just higher 4 years later. Anyway, you can't transfer bitcoin good when you're 14
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:20:46
You're welcome

These fees go to the miners, because they set up them. But if you look in the internet, you'll see that a large number of transactions are serviced in such a way that the commission can not be paid. In turn, if there are many entries in the transaction (that is, it has a large data size), a small commission is in the order of things
When payment is not charged by fees
- Translation of more than 0.01 BTC
- Translation does not take up much space in the block
- Bitcoins with which the transaction will be committed have many confirmations

You should have patience and just wait man

The next few days are the most interesting in the history of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in General. If everything goes according to the good scenario, bitcoin will become easier but normal users will not see changes. But if there will be a bad scenario, bitcoin will be divided into several alternative currencies with a common history, and some transactions made during the transitional period will be cancelled. I think you should buy it now
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:44:28
Wait and in future you could be a new Kristoffer Koch:)

Future is a contract for the purchase of crypto currency in the future,but at a price that is already set at the moment. This allows the customer to hedge against excessive price increases - but it means additional costs in the event that the prices for the goods are reduced.
So you see that it depends only on price.
Or do you mean some other thing? the tems of contract or what?
Sorry for my misunderstanding 
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:55:33
This idea is possible only if someone has enough money to buy out all 21 million bitcoins)
If we take into account that its price will grow after every transaction, that would be hard)
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:46:57
It's funny that trying to ruin it only brings more popularity.
Nevertheless, Bitcoin is a good cryptocurrency to invest in. So it makes more good, than harm. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:18:40
I can't advise anybody to go all in. Most people really trust to btc but only crazy can go all in)
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:05:46
And what do ya think about other countries? I'm from Russia and for the last time a noticed, thatbusinesses there show growing interest in accepting cryptocurrencies for their goods and services. Several retailers and restaurants have announced that they are already accepting Bitcoin payments. 
For instance, Novikov's restaurants, pubs, farmer cooperative LavkaLavka and black cooperative.
Maybe Bitcoin will be legalized in Russia in the near future... And what about your countries?
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:23:00
First of all, you should understand how it works and what it is based on. Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for bitcoin's price to fluctuate as the market seeks price discovery. Reasons for changes in sentiment may include a loss of confidence in Bitcoin, a large difference between value and price not based on the fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy, increased press coverage stimulating speculative demand, fear of uncertainty, and old-fashioned irrational exuberance and greed.
So actually you will never be sure how it will change. But i can assure you that in the near future there won't be any recessions. Because, for instance, in Russia we only start entering the Bitcoin system. Lots of companies start accepting this. And its turnover will increase its value.
So maybe it would be better to start with the understanding of how it works and what prospects it has. You can start investins small sums.
Good luck!

It seems you don't know enough about this crypto currency. I believe you need to think more about this way. But hurry up cause there is 1th august soon
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:58:10
Just look at the table on this site, my friend.
It seems to be that Ledger Nano is the best
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:04:00
I'm not sure. Maybe this is a direct result of growing demand of Bitcoin-linked products?
I'm from Russia and more and more stores there start accepting Bitcoins, so i think that in the near future its value will grow much more than now. That's why more and more people are looking to invest in cryptocurrencies...
Correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:17:27
The bitcoin rate should grow due to legalization in most countries. What do you think, how many times will the rate increase?
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:40:03
It's alright. just wait 1th august. Soon!
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:35:16
This one and bitcoin talk are the best for today
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:06:03
This is a sad feeling, when you want just a one bitcoin, but most likely you'll eat a corn :(
But there are too much really good crypto currencies in the world. I guess there will be corncoin soon

Bitcoin can be bought on a specialized market or directly from another owner of cryptocurrency.
My personal rating opens Bitstamp. It is currently one of the largest, oldest, and, importantly, stable BTC exchanges with a license in Luxembourg.
If you want to buy a whole bitcoin, or even several, Bitstamp is a great. Other major bitcoin exchanges: Kraken, Bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:13:14
I think all of us need to keep some on flash rise. And that's what I'm doing:)
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:15:30
Bitcoin is far better protected against risks than any physical currency. The only thing it lacks is the imprimatur of a government - or anything else.
So even after the split you will lose nothing.
But nevertheless, its price depends on the demand, so maybe it will change...
