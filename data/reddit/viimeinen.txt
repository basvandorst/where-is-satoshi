I repeat that *no one ever argued in this thread that the bank run isn't real*, so might as well stop repeating that like a broken record. 
From where I stand no one was even arguing, just pointing out that there is (was) no proof to call it a bank run (then). And there wasn't. Now there is. Calling lack of proof is a very *scientist* thing to do, calling people names is a very *politicial* thing to do. Guess who's who.
And again, no one *is* a strawman, so stop putting words in people's mouths (for once in this thread). For fuck's sake.

To put it simply:
- With PGP you encrypt with your recipient's key. No one else can read it.
- With SSL you encrypt with you mail provider's key. Anyone else past that point *might* read it.

No, it's not the "same thing". It's absolutely not "*literally* the same thing" (by definition).
- Less time consuming
- Much more convenient
- Smaller fees (exchange + sepa transfer)
- Less traceable
- Paying for food directly with bitcoin supports the ecosystem and "washes bitcoin's image"

Apparently you don't know what a strawman argument is, and you took it personally. Too bad. You should stop calling people on the internet "idiots" (it doesn't look good for your self) and maybe google it.
This is the discussion:
* You: Bank run is real now (Claim: there is a bank run)
* Him: You've provided no evidence of this (Claim: that is not enough proof)
* You: Nothing to see here. (Claim: ???)
* Him: Unsubstantiated claims and a few pics of people queuing for ATMs. (Claim: still not enough proof)
* You: It's a hoax. No problems in Greece. (Claim: hurr durr claims there are no problems in Greece).
NOBODY claimed *there are no problems in Greece*. No one even claimed that *there is no bank run*. The only argument made here is that *you provided no proof of a bank run*, which still holds. Yes, Greece has problems. Yes, there is a bank run. Yes, you were right. No, you didn't *provide evidence of a bank run*.

I do not neglect training costs of Bitcoin: I have clearly said:


Set-up: purchase hardware, installation, provider contracts, training, etc. I thought it was obvious.
To acquire BTC, 1% is the maximum I have seen (xapo and coinbase). I buy my bitcoins either at 0.35% at kraken or virtually fee-free in person (in any case, less than 0.35%, otherwise I buy at kraken). For volume purchases the fee is even smaller. If/when acceptance and usage increases, I assume fees will also shrink across the board.
The 1% that you get back where do you think comes from? The merchant pays it, and to cover it, it increases the price of the goods. 
2% discount? Sounds very reasonable, I have seen up to 20% (yes, they were bitcoin enthusiasts). Some shops have up to a 5% discount if you pay in cash, so a 2% for bitcoin seems perfectly plausible to me.
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:11:53
On bitcoin.de 0.5%, on kraken.com 0.35%, in person/cash... depends.

You seem to have a hard time grasping the concept "in the long run"...

No. The comunication between your browser/email client and your email provider might be encrypted, but you don't have any guarantees past that point.
ALWAYS treat non-PGP email as info that can be seen by anyone.
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:27:32
Simple arithmetic suggests that 4% - 1% = 3% minimum savings, once set-up costs have been amortized. When buying a 20€ pizza the shop gets a full 1€ more from a bitcoin-paying client. And I really prefer my local pizza shop to keep the 1€ rather than give it to paypal / VISA / MasterCard. 
Even if the savings were smaller, 0.5% is still very relevant when running a business. 
Besides, regarding your previous argument, some (not all) shops DO pass the savings to you.
@_date: 2015-06-15 00:41:36


Also, which is why bitcoin doesn't create unusual costs. No even extra costs if integrated solutions are implemented, as for instance NFC payments.


No, it's not. *You* claimed it's stolen goods. *You* prove it. (google "Burden of proof" if unsure why).


Users adopting it won't mean anything if no merchant offers it. Water is wet. Any other pointless, irrelevant, obvious fact to add to the list?


[citation needed]
INB4 reversing the burden of proof again: I use it. Most people commenting in this post use it. So no, it's not true that "no one" uses it. It's not even true that an irrelevant fraction of clients use it, as lieferservice used it and lieferando is considering implementing it.


* Not really a ton of effort. For me personally, much easier, faster and more convenient than going to an ATM. For other people might be even cheaper and/or safer.
* Saving 1% has never been the point of bitcoin, or the best potential reason for its adoption. Nor have I claimed/suggested it will. It may be possible, and a welcome side effect, but absolutely not *the reason* to go mainstream.
@_date: 2015-06-15 01:29:56


Oh, you found one more obvious fact! Congrats. Maybe someone didn't know that you need bitcoin-aware PoS to process bitcoin payments.


If it's an *integrated* solution. Like an NFC system (I feel like I typed this not 5 minutes ago...)


One more pointless obvious fact! You are on fire! Nobody asked you to prove a negative. Don't move goalposts. Prove that most discounts for paying in bitcoin (vs other payment systems) are offered on stolen items. Any study / article / paper with sources will do.


Stolen cards? WTF? Nowhere before were stolen cards mentioned, it was *you* who introduced the concept and you spoke about *items*, not cards. Anyway, last time I visited my local flea market several people offered bitcoin discounts (one selling knitted wearables, another vintage video games). Cash accepted as well at tag price. You're welcome.

Please read my posts. I am getting tired of re-typing stuff. Acquiring over kraken (or any other exchange if you like to pay more fees) takes less than a minute and goes directly to my phone if I choose so. Going to the closest ATM and back takes a minimum of 10 minutes, and that if there is no waiting line at the machine. I live in a good neighborhood in the city center and my ATM has no charge. If I had to walk in a bad area and/or drive/pay ATM fees, bitcoin would be also safer and/or cheaper.


Unless people who love to be evangelical about it... what? You sentence is incomplete.
Anyway, seems like you claimed many things in this thread:
* [buying with bitcoin is *literally* the same as exchanging the bitcoin and paying with fiat](
* [payment with bitcoin only makes the processors rich](
* [payment with bitcoin is not cheaper](
* [payment with bitcoin is cheaper only for stolen items](
Things which you have either retracted/contradicted or have been unable to back with proof, all while moving the goalposts of the discussion (which originally was: "*using an exchange is not literally the same as paying directly with bitcoin*").
If you hate bitcoin or bitcoin usage, you are in your right to do so, just stop the wild goose chase of obstacles to... "win" (?) an argument on the internet.

My guess? It would be gone in less than a minute.
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:28:39
The processors do a job and deserve to get paid for it.
On top of that, AFAIK bitpay chages 1% for converting bitcoin to fiat and sending it to your back account the same day. Visa and MasterCard charge 4% + 50 cents for moving fiat around with a two months delay.
Accepting bitcoin could be cheaper for the shops in the long run, if nothing else, by forcing the CC companies to lower their fees.
@_date: 2015-06-28 02:03:57
What a textbook strawman we have here... nice.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:37:53


Same for CC readers, cash registers, office software...


No, they are not. It's a discount to promote bitcoin (or a 25% fee for not-using it, if you will). It's not about bitcoin-only shady tor sites, it's about markets, restaurants and shops run by bitcoin enthusiasts.


For the merchant it barely has any, AFAIK bitpay and co. calculate the btc price in real time and make the fiat deposit every day.
For the buyer it might or might not be worth it, depending on your use case. If you try to minimize volatility and nowadays buy bitcoin at an exchange for every single purchase, probably not. If bitcoin becomes widely used the value will stabilize and buying bitcoin will be no different than going go an ATM. Security and ease of use will also come with time: it's already much easier to use than a year ago and hardware wallets will provide security for those who need it. For today, I consider the 20 bucks of bitcoin on my android phone to be as secure as the 20 bucks in paper in my wallet.

Well, just to play the devil's advocate I read the article and found it interesting. As I'm not familiar with the PoS paper I can't vouch 100% for it but it seems that it has a point, I woudn't be surprised if people would legitimately feel like sharing it.

What said. Many distributions are aimed at making Linux more approachable and easy to use, to make it more attractive to the general public. As (and if) more and more "normal" people use it, the "average" user will be less and less savvy.

A couple of remarks:
* test the site with NoScript, maybe add a user-friendly message to activate js. Extra nice if you include which domains to white-list.
* I wondered for a while what happens with the change (then I scrolled down and saw the change address), maybe adding a hint in the load invitation would be useful.
* is it expected/known by the staff to pay this way? I've never seen anything like this before at starbucks (non-US, tho...)

As a commenter on youtube pointed out, as soon as you make a transaction, according to best-practices your hardcore memorized key is now obsolete.
Is it even allowed in the protocol to use an address as input and output of a transaction?
