What kind of another support thread are you talking about??? 
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:58:53
OP is very trustful and thoughtless. He will die from AIDS.

This is the next step when you decided to join using credit card, but there is a checkbox allowing you to use bitcoin to join. And it will redirect you to bitpay... like so

Where did you find their ICQ?
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:04:47
I have just asked this in the chatbox on their site. Do they have skype and are they giving this chat in tickets... and admin answered "no, we do not provide support through skype"
Oh they can lie of course.
Can you give us this skypename which suppose to be a btc-e support skype?
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:16:59
I have asked this in russian chat. Admins there are very chatty.


Because of what? Because OP has found a random skype account who asked him to pay 2btc pretending to be a BTC-e support? 
Now you will be even more worried... because... I am a BTC-e support and you need to pay me 1000btc or your account will be locked.
Of course this is a joke. What is not a joke that guys like you and OP are constantly trying to shed shit on BTC-e. I am very concerned with this shill activity.

Like Casascius didn't preserve the private keys before issuing tokens. People are stupid. Cryptocurrency can't have any physical tokens. Casascius may be fraudster. Do not let him hold his hand in your pocket.

Now reread the conversation taking in account that OP talking to some random skype he found on reddit. Obviously OP has found a scammer who has just asked him to pay 2btc and he has no relation to BTC-e.
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:19:37
Where did you find skype name on their front page?
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:46:56
Use this direct link 
Looks like they didn't yet updated all the site.

eMule with Kad was. eDonkey was just a centralized network with an unreliable client. Jed McCaleb was never being smart. He is always praised by people with [baby duck syndrome]( only.

Source please that  is operated by Brazzers? It looks like it only pretend to be part of Brazzers network. They use a different billing system than Brazzers.com it is very strange. They also have a different support phone number... but this alone can't disproof anything though.

You are registered for 2 month have submitted this rather popular post but in your profile:




@_date: 2014-02-16 21:53:50
BTC-e admins have just confirmed that their support have no skype. Looks like you are trying to cheat with me.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:12:40
As I already said official eDonkey client did copy Kad network from eMule. Credits were very important that day. Torrent trackers of the time was also very attentive to Up/Down rate.
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:23:38
Just open the link I provided in incognito tab and you will see this  [NSFW]
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:18:43
As was already said they will not die. They are collecting fee right now and then just continue operation. It is very dangerous for gox to declare bankruptcy. People know who director is and where he is living.

It is not an official statement. In [original post]( it was stated that Ukranian Central bank are able to register "electoric" currency (like webmoney). Who will register BitCoin? BitCoin foundation? And it is not a press release published by bank. It is just a reporter who asked this in conversation with UCB press interaction department. Looks like they were pretty confused by these questions and answered according to the current law. Nothing new. They still can ban BitCoin as pyramid for example. They haven't think about it yet.

Overnet was added to eDonkey only after Kad was implemented in eMule. The network was ruined by an advertising campaign of bittorrent protocol.  Most users with broad internet access have switched to private trackers.

As I understand they claim that client do not check for double spend before retransmission. It only check validity and balance. That makes it possible to ddos network with this same transaction differ only in its hash. It sounds very weird because client and miner share the same code.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:37:29
That perfectly makes sense. OP found a scammer who have absolutely no relation to BTC-e. Just reread this conversation assuming this. Scammer just asks OP to pay him 2btc. End of story.
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:25:13
Hm. Yes. Wikipedia also lists Mofos among the Brazzers owner MindGeek brands. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:36:53
Looks like it is not a support guy. Have no idea where OP has found this scammer. All he did is just trying to draw 2btc out of OP.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:46:35
I am from Russia. Russian IP also works.
