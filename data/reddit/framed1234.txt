Gold and silver are less volatile then bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:25:23
Maybe thry removed it temporarily because fees were too high?
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:46:48
Do you know what volatile mean?bitcoin's price fluctuate more than silver and gold. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but it does have more price swings
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:45:12
They're actually under investigation
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:34:24
Just because something is decentralized and has blockchain doesn't make it related to bitcoin

I'm actually getting more and more annoyed by my government. They constantly change their mind if they want to regulate or ban cryptos. I'll support them if they implement minimum regulations to protect people and tax it, but they are not making their mind.

Bithumb is a scam exchange. Theysay servers “overloaded and down for maintenance “ whenever there’s a huge dip or surge
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:19:23
We had 20% dip in here. People panicked

Stocks actually contribute to society because you are funding a company. Bitcoin does Jack shit for society

Nvidia confusing consumers with shitty naming scheme? Yes please
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:09:35
I think if it gets too big, governments will have to ban it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:12:52
I posted couple weeks ago here about this because west media is making fake news about this beung a ban. WE DON'T HAVE A BAN FFS. It's not even much of a regulation. It's just making easier to id people irl. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:46:30
I made the post because I saw fake news on crypto blogs and articles saying korean government banned them. Fucking reporters and bloggers spreading fake news to profit of ignorant people angered me
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:56:44
Exactly. Cryptos are getting out of hands here. I saw 12 year olds in subway trading on bitthumb(largest korean exchange). This regulation will stop minors from trading
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:13:37
It's not ban a ban. Article got it wrong
Korean article if you can read it or translate it
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:02:00
Bitcoin has already failed decentralization. They are merely some stock option. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:51:49
I don't really mind this because I'm not doing anything illegal and I support taxation of cryptocurrencies. 가즈아~~
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:04:28
Decentralization isn't always good. I don't know about in US, but at least here in Korea, government artificially controls the exchange rate and stuffs to make sure Middle class and lower doesn't get hit too hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:48:08
Over 30k or exactly 30k? No bamboozle
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:10:28
Western media is the worst shit ever. I thought media here was bad but i was wrong
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:07:49
By then it would have been 15$
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:52:16
Not as much imo
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:39:36
Thanks man. I don't know why reported this as a ban. Even if you just google translate it it says regulate. These articles talking about ban is sham

But Visa is usable in more places. No matter how big bitcoin gets, unless companies accept them as payment they will always have t be turned into fiat money
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:52:51
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:18:46
It was mainly about no trading for underage(a lot of minors trade cryptos here) and 1 wallet per person? I don't quite remember and taxing it. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:55:52
You mean scam coin?

Nope.  It was developed by Korean search engine provider Naver. It was used during the tsunami tho

Line was made by Korean company, but literally noone uses Line in Korea. Their customer base is japan mostly
