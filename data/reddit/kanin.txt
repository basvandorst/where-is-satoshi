The inherent difference everyone is missing here is that when a bank lends money it goes into a bank, that's how they can lend more than they have, by keeping the money at all time anyway. Bitcoins on the other hand won't neceseraly remain in the banks possession (in fact this whole discussion assumes bank will continue to exist, that's not a given), that's what break the electronic printing press.

i think the latter is a hundredth of the former, the price should reflect that, and so would the dividends (with a 5% for the hundredth, namely TAT).

completely unrelated but your comment made me think... eventually when sellers tie their prices to bitcoins instead of fiat through bitcoins, people still living in fiat will have a huge incentive to use bitcoins for those periods of cheaper prices due to btc/fiat swinging.

Two things, first, how is it impossible for capital to drive the price of bitcoins up? If they keep buying up bitcoins at higher and higher prices in fiat money, won't it drive the price of bitcoins up?
And second, Chyprus.

@_date: 2013-05-29 02:29:54
Using bitcoins is a political act and a bet on the future. The people that leave their bitcoins in exchanges are traders, they make/lose money on risk, today they lose, too bad, but my bitcoins are safe, safer than my dollars in fact.
@_date: 2013-06-15 19:49:18

@_date: 2013-06-13 01:19:56
1. do you need their money? if yes go to step 2, if not go to step 6.
2. find out the conditions, if you like the conditions, go to step 4, otherwise step 3.
3. bargain, if you find an agreement go to step 4, otherwise repeat, when sick of it, step 6
4. Take the money, go to step 5
5. Respect agreement, go to step 6
6. The end

I don't know about your example, i'm quite ok with bitcoins rewarding jokes.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:15:31
1. Then why should a miner and say a banana reseller be similar legal entities?  What is the common denominator? 
2. Fair enough, let's take another example among the millions we have... artists have a very easy time travelling compared to say a woodworker (that's regulation right?)... so we're already applying this.
@_date: 2013-06-02 17:15:15

it should show up in npm repository and the gekko bot shortly.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:42:29
i'm not really arguing, we're in perfect agreement , i just don't understand the surprise that we have different regulations for somewhat similar things. The woodworker doesn't have to bring everything along, just show up for a job, and i didn`t mean airlines, rather visa obtention.

@_date: 2013-06-22 15:42:38
1. Crowds give good reviews.
2. Nothing, it's possible to hoard (people that pretend they will get a *fading* money adopted live in fantasy world, no one will be interested to invest in something they will lose for sure).
3. Banks can't print bitcoins to finance politics/wars/whatever shitty idea they invsted in, no private printing press, that is the real game changer of bitcoins.
4. Don't care.
@_date: 2013-06-07 23:16:33

@_date: 2013-10-23 11:12:04
depends the success of bitcoins, assuming it becomes a reference currency of worldwide trade, it's not all that unrealistic, the uncertainty is its success.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:56:02
does it not? individuals get taxed differently than corporations, because they make money through different means and volumes, but it's still making money... so we're already applying this.

While i agree he is a genius, what you see as a goal here is a mere by-product of the decentralization, that's what he was going for, throwing the printing press into history, not fuck around legal terms with the government, that's just bonus.

Such a behavior would actually convince me otherwise, when you are in the business of making money, chaos is bad, when you are into law enforcement on the other hand (particularly the war on drugs)...
@_date: 2013-05-24 01:48:09
My advice is that you shouldn't invest for dollars but for bitcoins, if bitcoin takes over the world, it'll be 21 million units against 7 billions people, a single bitcoin will be worth quite something then. It might take a while though, it might never happen either.
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:03:29

Well with real money they will have to earn it instead of printing it, on top of it if the real money comes in the form of bitcoins their business model will degrade quite seriously, all in all I think we'll be able to buy back the pieces for cheap eventually.

The idea is that you can have a politicial influence with money, and political influence of course is considered speech because America! What happens with btc keys is that gov can't take it away from you, so it's more than speech, it's free speech (if you agree that money is speech in the first place).

The rationale is that if btc grow to be used globally, there will be 21M of them for billions of users. The big question is whether or not it will be used globally and replace fiat currencies, far from certain.
