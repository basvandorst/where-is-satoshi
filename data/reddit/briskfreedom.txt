Can someone ELI5 what this means? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:57:12
Proof of payment due? Proof that landlord will sue?
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:36:01
They are literally not updating the fucking site. The ceo himself has encouraged his customers to use other exchanges 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:01:26
Where??? I don’t see them 
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:06:08
Apparently not. That fact on its own is making me stick with Gemini. It’s not your bitcoin if you don’t hold the keys.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:40:09
Following to see what others say.

If you read Coinbase and it’s updates you would see that Sewgit2x was never able to be implemented. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:05:50
Sounds about right. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:21:01
Well coinbase isn’t giving you BCH until January 2018. And Sewgit2x never happened. It got postponed/cancelled. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:46:18
Gonna be honest. Not ever selling because I don’t wanna have to deal with the tax paperwork at the end of the year 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:34:38
Solid advice here. Very true. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:36:49
I know GDAX is part of Coinbase, but why not recommend GDAX for someone just getting into bitcoin? Doesn’t it save them a lot on fees? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:18:50
Almost shit my pants thinking it was U.S lol. still though, big accomplishment 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:53:05
To give a more realistic and hopeful response- maybe.
One thing to look out for with the fork coming up. The prices may drop then.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:17:44
Newbie here as well. I am thinking of after the fork. But honestly, as long as the bitcoins are in your own wallet, things should go smoothly.  I’m waiting on my bank deposit to stop pending so I can purchase my first set of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:15:40
Holy shit. It’s going up and up! 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:01:48
So, you’re saying that buying and HODL is not the best way to go? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:31:59
Not a full bitcoin yet. lol. Should clarify that ha 
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:22:28
I’m just happy it went down from 6k. Been able to happily purchase a few more bitcoins here and there.
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:22:03
Yep. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:46:20
Well you gave pretty great advice. I hope at least one person joins us over here.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:04:26
It seems that the OP from the post you linked was faking it. Regardless, Ledger Nano S is what I’m looking to get. It’s a good investment if you’re serious about keeping your money safe. Even if it is seen as a bad investment, which it is not, I would rather have a bad investment than be pissed the fuck off by someone stealing my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:50:08
Thank you for explaining that :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:22:25
No shit.
Why did you send it to that specific exchange? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:51:49
Haha, I’m hopeful as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:06:55
Thank you for clarifying that! Appreciate your responses
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:34:18
I just pulled the trigger and will be purchasing some bitcoins once it goes through with my bank. It’s addicting to be entering this. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:18:05
Aren’t they married? Maybe he is using a savings fund they BOTH have control over.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:36:32
Yeah I figured. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:32:09
TailsOS? What is that?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:52:01
Why did you send some in the first place? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:22:52
STRAP ON TIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:11:32
A node? What’s that?
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:36:15
Right. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:00:56
Go to GDAX. Search for a tab that says limits. Then click on sell. It’ll give you an option to input the amount of bitcoin and how much It could be worth. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:54:31
How much?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:23:08
HODL! 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:51:33
A recommendation for a safe place to buy bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:55:17
Sooooo, what’s stopping thousands of people with bitcoins from doing this and have the price drop significantly? This is  scary lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:18:23
You don’t need to download anything to buy and sell bitcoins. You do need to download wallets and apps if you decide you want to keep your bitcoins under your own control.
You can buy bitcoins right now on GDAX and transfer it over to a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:19:32
I would suggest spelling each word backwards and you can only reveal them correctly using a mirror. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:40:47
I think so. If I let myself be discouraged because of the high prices, I will never gain anything.
I mean, 4 years ago $1000 per bitcoin would be WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. Who’s the say in the future 6k will be seen as doable and the new dip for bitcoin. No one knows. But investing now seems like a smart move.
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:05:08
The purpose of having your bitcoins in a wallet is to keep it safe. When you buy it from coinbase and you decide to keep it there, you are risking having full control over your own bitcoins. It’s not fully yours until it’s in your own wallet. 
The value of your bitcoin will rise or drop regardless of it being in coinbase or in your wallet. The market value is the market value and keeping your bitcoins in location A  vs location B won’t make it worth more or less than market value. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:19:15
Found the Ausie 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:38:36
Can you explain what are ALT coins? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:58:19
If I bought let's say, $6000 worth of bitcoins, will those bitcoins be worth a lot more than $6000 if I decide to sell them in about 5 years from now? I'm trying to learn here, lol.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:40:04
Just to piggyback off this response. You can transfer your bitcoins from coinbase to GDAX fee free and then from GDAX to your own wallet fee free. Coinbase and GDAX are run by the same people. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:48:15
Like litecoin and ethereum? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:32:41
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:43:40
Try transferring your bitcoins to GDAX though. Once it is transferred there you can transfer it to your electrum wallet for free. Avoid the $2 fee. Surprised no one mentioned this. 
GDAX is part of Coinbase, that’s why the fees are low. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:38:59
Buy from GDAX. You pay $0.00 on fees. Use a reliable wallet. I am using Electrum until I have the extra cash for a hardware wallet and until I begin purchasing more bitcoins and ALT coins. I don’t know about prepaid Visa cards though. I just use my bank. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:16:44
Right click. Abandon transaction. Resend with a decent fee.
Transactions with 0 fees never get confirmed.
