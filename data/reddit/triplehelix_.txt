completely different set of regulations.  the regulatory and licensing costs, liabilities of creating a centrally controlled currency, becoming a bank and a money transferring service are massive.
releasing code for bitcoin doesn't put them under any of those responsibilities or expose them to any of those liabilities.
my understanding is tesla's aren't all that great at hashing.  besides, if google wanted to play with bitcoin, i highly doubt it would be on live servers.

this is definitely the type of thing that needs as much support as possible.  if everyone in grubgoing distance ordered a single meal with bitcoins, it would go a long long way.

yeah, definitely worth getting that sorted out.  with dwolla you'll only pay $0.25 to transfer in money.  with other services you'll pay between 2-5%.  dwolla can save you a lot of money.  what problem are you having?

the more apt analogy, and one with legal precedent, is the courts ability to order a defendant to open a safe.  not divulge the combination mind you, but to open it.

the gold standard, as i understand it, tied a note to a specific weight of that precious metal, and the note could be redeemed for that weight of the precious metal.  there have been various iterations of the gold standard, but that's the relevant TLDR version.
as for the safe/encryption, i can see the merits of both arguments, and could probably argue both sides.
if you don't mind a bit of reductio ad absurdum, lets say there existed a physical safe that when closed, scrambled the atoms of the contents and held them in that state until the correct password was entered to open the safe (i imagine star trek technology would be at play).
it would seem your position would then say that a person should, in that scenario, not be able to be forced to open their romulan safe.
in my opinion, if it is legal to force someone to open a safe, i don't see how two different safes, (saves? safe'?) would be governed by two different standards, for clarification thats a modern brinks safe and the romulan atom scrambling safe.
and thats why when we are looking at the application of legislation, we need to take into consideration evolving technologies and the impact legislation will have.
to me, physical documents have given way in many cases to their digital analogs.  accordingly digital safes where created to protect these digital documents.  while i see nuance, i don't see them as completely different.
if i have a paper document in a safe, i don't see why scanning that document and encrypting it provides me any special legal protection over just leaving the paper version in the physical safe.
the courts are wrestling with this right now, and a ruling that forced decryption is unconstitutional would be a win for personal rights, it would also allow a lot of nefarious activity committed by those who already have enough evidence against them to be officially charged with a crime, to go unpunished.
that alone isn't a good enough justification to me to allow the trampling of establish individual rights and liberties, but its certainly part of the conversation.

i don't know if stating the contents of the romulan safe don't exist can be called true.  it lends itself to a far bigger debate involving the nature of reality.  hell, maybe it's schroeder's safe and the contents both exist and don't exist simultaneously.
interesting about the combination safe.  very telling that the author's answer as to the validity of the protection against self incrimination is "maybe".  pretty much sums up the whole argument.  i haven't completely made up my mind on the issue, but as you can tell, i'm certainly leaning far more in one direction than the other.
anyway, thank you for an interesting discussion online without one mention of the nazi's and not pointing out my instances of right spelling wrong word.

i'll wait to see what the fees are before i get too excited.  good news regardless if it comes to fruition, but as it stands now the bitinstant fees for existing options are not very attractive.

at least as bad (to me at least) is you need to wait 30 days from first pulling money into dwolla, before you can send funds to mtgox.

if you think google is just winging it, you don't know anything about the company.  the most famous example is when they couldn't decide on a specific shade of blue for search results, so tested 41 different shades with users, and rolled out a weighted average shade:
they do the exact opposite of winging it.  good or bad?  i make no comment, just pointing out an inaccuracy.

they were recently sold, so have a slightly longer lease on life.  recommend or ask if they would consider bitcoing to avoid this issue in the future.
this is a great opportunity to expand bitcoin usage, and is a perfect fit for this company.
@_date: 2012-02-19 01:51:21
when did they start accepting bitcoin?  i'm just wondering how long from having the ability to someone actually using it was.
@_date: 2012-03-05 22:07:12
yeah, if you can, log into your bank account online.  you'll see two small deposits in your checking account, usually a couple pennies each.  you go to the dwolla site, and put the amount of the two transactions in the verify bank account section.  once your dwolla is sorted, log into mtgox, go to funding options, select dwolla from the drop down menu, scroll down and click the account number which will bring you to the dwolla transaction page.

while i understand the irony your referring too, mining isn't what bitcoin is about.

@_date: 2012-03-17 20:50:20
yeah, i was going to say the same thing.  i've been in full OCD mode on bitcoin the last month, and i never once so much as stumbled on this site, nor seen a single ad or article on the countless bitcoin centric sites i've visited.
velocom, you'll notice the website linked sold in USD, and accepted bitcoin in addition.  the business failed, and the fact that they accepted bitcoin as an alternate payment method had exactly zero impact on that happening.  accepting bitcoin doesn't magically make a business into profitability.
if you have a successful business model, adding an additional payment method can do nothing but enhance your service, and absolutely no ability to shut you down (assuming the cost of adding that payment method are cheap, and it doesn't get cheaper than bitcoin).  but if you are indeed a successful business person, i'm sure you already understand that.  
it's like someone adding american express to payments accepted (visa/mc which customers are obviously not using already), no customers using amex, and the business then shutting down and blaming nobody using american express for the business failing.

in reality, its more complex than either of our analogies, and there is a lot to figure out.
with that said, we have digital analogs of physical items.  money for instance.  most of the money supply exists only as a digital entity within the banking industry through the money expanding process of fractional banking.  now if say a hacker were to gain access to a banks systems and transfer that digital "money" it is treated exactly like physical money.
a strong case can be made that a password protected encrypted file is the digital analog of a safe containing physical files.

bitcoin seems to be a definite target, and the very recent security breach across multiple sites (but one host) lends itself to a touch of the paranoia i imagine.

i'm a HUGE fan of bitcoin, and i don't know that it will even survive long term let alone dominate the global economy.
the biggest concern i have, based on history, is that bitcoin is the proof of concept system that lays the ground work for the system that does in fact reach critical mass.
@_date: 2012-03-13 03:42:06
why would you carry around a wallet that had ALL your money in it, regardless if its bitcoin or fiat money?
common sense is why we keep the bulk of our money in a bank for fiat (or mattress), and a separate preferably offline wallet for the bulk of your bitcoin.

paypal stands on shaky legs with some of its past maneuvers, but this is a perfect example of just how out of control, and over-reaching they have become.
while paypal dying does not mean bitcoin replaces it, it most certainly highlights why something like bitcoin, even if not bitcoin itself, is very much needed.
@_date: 2012-02-26 17:42:04
i agree with you that the introduction of fiat money removed the intrinsic value, but since we are talking about the legal system, there is a large body of legal precedent for treating physical money as tangible property.
the bookie scenario doesn't rely on him "opening a locked door", as the safe and encrypted file system do.  it would require him to either provide the "combination", which is not required in safe/encryption scenario, or to reproduce a clear text copy of the coded material, which is also not required in the safe/encryption scenario.
the pivot point is the requirement to give access to a locked box, not to turn over the combination, or to reproduce self incriminating material.
and just so you know where i'm coming from, i'm a strong proponent of privacy, personal liberties, and limiting the power and control of over reaching government.  as with so many things though, the balancing act between an individuals rights and the groups need to prosecute individuals acting in a way to harm the group, is a tricky one.

the fact that the coins you got appreciated, or the value bitinstant may be adding, has no bearing on the expense of their fees.
they are providing a service, so obviously need to make a profit, i just think the fees are too high is all.  as it stands, for me anyway, wiring funds is much more economical.

yes, that is part of what i was saying.  US regulations can make it harder for US citizens to transfer USDs into bitcoin, but even if they tried to make it illegal (which as far as i can tell, and i've been doing a TON of research since i recently fell in love with bitcoin, it currently is not), that alone would not stop it.
however for a US corporation looking to make their own bitcoin like currency system, that is a very real concern.
@_date: 2016-10-31 22:09:42
no, not depending on what is being sold.  a customer wants to hit the submit button and get a confirmation that the transaction is complete.  they want a confirmation number knowing their part (remitting funds) is over, and they just need to sit back and wait for their products.
a customer hitting submit, then having to wait ~15 minutes for a confirmation, wait 15 minutes to know the order is actually complete, yes, it is a massive roadblock in the uptake of btc as a payment method even online.
@_date: 2016-10-31 19:30:33
a ~15 minute wait is absolutely a massive roadblock to widespread adoption from both provider and consumer perspectives.
are you of the opinion that most consumers would be happy to switch from near instant payments to hanging around for 15 minutes every time they want to make a purchase/payment?
