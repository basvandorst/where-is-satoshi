Bitcoin is filling the niche for gold in the cryptocurrency space. You used to be able to walk into a shop and buy things with gold but it isn't practical. Doesn't mean gold isn't valuable.  Bitcoin is still the main entry point into the crypto markets around the world. No other coin has the same level of trade to fiat currencies. If people are still thinking you will go around in the future with a Bitcoin bank card you have missed the point of why there has been such large gains.

I think it's over hyped. Looking at BTC/Won they have bounced back significantly further and quicker than BTC/USD
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:55:08
Can't wait to buy up those $3 bitcoins!
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:23:47
The whales pumped the alt coins to help accumulate Bitcoin. Once this bounce is over it will maybe/probably be back on its way up to over $20k.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:21:58
Some whale just pushed it down to $13,500
Edit: $13,300 and I feel that may be an end to it. In about 4 hours I think we will know whether that's it.

In Australia all savings with a bank are guaranteed by the government. I'm sure other countries have brought this in because of the issues prior to 2008. Same reasons that drove the growth of Bitcoin. USDT being so greatly integrated in the market is a massive step back. The interface between cryptosporidium and fiats shouldnt be with a proxy that blurs the edge of where the regulated and unregulated markets meet.

We either have a triangle or a bull flag. If it's a triangle the next wave will be up around this point at which point it bounces down then back up to moon. If it is a bull flag we go past the last high of 16 then we are going down. Good point to sell and lock in profits either way.

It won't happen. It would be like if England decided to ban it straight after America formally endorsed legalised it. They are also heavily invested. It will hurt their economy. Won't happen. That said it isn't the only reason for this low. It has also been a correction since ATH.

Because tether makes no sense. How does tether purchase the cash to back it? Do they sell the BTc or whatever to people with real fiat? Does this happen instantly? People get into tether when market is going down and get out when tether is going up. If it's going down and they aren't purchasing the cash instantly then they have constant losses. Can the amount of cash backing tether ever be reduced? Do they have spare cash to buy BTC then sell it for tether for the supply to be reduced. Does it grow indefinitely?

Why don't you ladder in to hedge your bets?
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:09:55
I added to my position obviously. I think that was the second or last bottom then it will be on its way up. It's an accumulation period, they (being the heavies) pumped the alts now they are pushing down BTC to buy up more so the bulls will be out in force soon enough. New ATH before mid Feb.

My guess would be alot of weak hands have been shaken already so there's no rush at the moment.

I like the bullish Koreans! They knew a bargain when they saw it...at least by their standards

If you have the balls you could sell now and buy at $8k (if you think it will get there) and gain 25% in terms of btc.

There are a couple of technical analyses that indicate different things. I am confident in saying it will be worth more next December than today. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:16:31
I think the value still remains. Cryptoncies like bitcoin offer a store of wealth outside of government intervention for the most part. I think alot of alts will die off but Bitcoin will be around a long time. People point out the benefit of it if you live in places like Venezuela but for most westerners we are too stubborn and don't think things like that could happen to our country. Look at Greece, a country in the EU. 
Alot of the limitations can be overcome not just by changes to Bitcoin but changes to other technologies like faster network infrastructure and computing power.

A lot of countries have already moved their economy away from the US towards China. The new silk road is something massive. Though I don't think the US is going to crash this year.

It was an opinion much to the same way as saying Jan sale is over was an opinion. Prices go up and down, no need to get upset when someone thinks they have a little further to go down.

Nup we are going to $40k this time...
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:22:11
Not quite, it will get to the low 13s.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:10:27
You think most the value in cryptos is their technology? Largest adoption and years of growth. If Bitcoin does fail the current scale of adoption in other cryptos would decrease dramatically. Do you think Granny will continue to put her money into an unregulated market if her mate lost big on Bitcoin? Do you think the Dutch went shopping for roses after the tulip bubble was over?

But by driving said car on a highway they are creating a burden for everyone else. The network has a problem in that they are able to do this in the first instance. Batching alone isn't a long term solution as it does nothing to guarantee long term performance.

The writer and news site are terrible, I wouldn't think much of it. There was also an article today, by what seemed like an 18 year old girl, complaining she got asked to leave a nightclub for wearing a hat.

All markets run in cycles. There is overall growth but there are smaller waves up and down towards the overall direction. Go to the trading view website and look at btc/USD. If you have the resolution at 1 day you will see the cycle. Change the resolution down to 1 hour &amp; 1 hour and you will see smaller and smaller waves making the overall trend. 
There are heaps of way people analyse this data to estimate when the bottom and tops  of the cycle will happen. There are simple things like wedges, bull flags, double tops &amp; bottoms and there are more complex ways like Elliott waves. Some people use fundamentals like market cap and news estimating the worth and what they are willing to pay.
After a high there is should be a pull back. You want this, it's healthy. What we are seeing now with BTC is the pull back.

I wouldn't buy into Tron but I think these comments about white papers are a bit ignorant. They're Chinese. The Chinese don't do business like Americans and their economy is going alright.

They take out a lump of cash every week or so. Means they only have to hold their local currency for a short time, not deluded.

It's a paper loss at this stage if you haven't sold, relax. Be patient and keep emotion out of it.
