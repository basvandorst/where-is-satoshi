It is not completely new, although being involved with Bitcoin has doubled my net worth over the past few years.

I bought all of the bitcoins I own. I was investing long before I ever heard of bitcoin.

I hold about 20% bitcoin.
I used to broker deals between some large players, a few of whom I introduced to bitcoin. However that has slowed down since the 266 crash.
The address I signed the message with is my long term cold storage. I don't plan on selling them for a long, long time.

Buying and trading, although I did invest in ASICMiner at IPO. I considered doing a private ASIC run for a while, but it is not worth the risk with difficulty the way it is.

I hold a few thousand dollars worth of litecoins.
