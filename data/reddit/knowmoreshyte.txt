To be fair, Tone's proven much of the market wrong since early this year as he has been the contrarian bear that's been right waaaaaay longer than many wanted him to be, myself included.

You use the exchange with the most volume as all other exchanges will generally (but not always) follow suit.

Lol, unhinged much?

That's how you know someone has won an argument with a soudn position, when they resort to accsuing strangers of wearing something silly.

It's bascially like asking locals who seem friendly but that secretly despsie you, for directions. They know what to paint on the chart to soak up the most btc.

Yea, I agree. Vitalik would likely not stand up well, especially on the basis of econ. Too much of a skinny teletubby alien to handle the seassoned grumpy, grounded old man.

Yep, basically. Nice analysis.

And they hire an accused rapist war monger who repealed Glass-Steagal (catalyst to 2008 collapse) to speak at their conference, which is fitting, imo.

Not bad. And then trying ot use TA for alts is like using map of said city, while in another city. Still, trend lines be trend lines. HoweverArthur Hayes/Bitmex only cares so much for our precious trendlines when he's in hte mood to snack on stop-losses and drink liquidations.  Him and the market makers at BItfinex seem to control the price of bitcoin moreso thanany other factors based upon my oberservation. Price always moves on one of hte two first.

You wont be in there forever, think how much where it'll be in 10 yeas, no bills or grocery shopping (outside comissary) for a decade. Could be quite party.
