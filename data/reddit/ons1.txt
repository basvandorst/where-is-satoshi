Well yesterday I checked. And the rate difference was around 6$. So if i would cash my btc to euros using an exchange i woulve got more for it. Not sure how they work yet but in my case it would mean more than 1% less money using bitpay. Which i consider the same as fee.

Bitcoin is not free in fees at all. They have their own exchange rate which is around 1% lower then other exchanges. So yea great company but the zero fee's is just a trick they play on people.

Too bad Steve Jobs is no longer in our place. He would have allowed bitcoin, setup an awesome easy to use  ios wallet for it, be awesome and let everyone pAy using their iphones and icash systems with bitcoin. Again being a true pioneer in the future of online financial systems. Awesome.

Expect downvotes because most Bitcoin fanatics are closed minded when it comes to alternatives. I myself have invested in blackcoin aswell.

Basicly u can add something with more value to a coin. For an example a stock. So u can take your 0.05BTC and add a stock share to it. This way u can sell your stock share via the bitcoin protocol. Its like enchanting an item in WoW and therefore the value increases.
