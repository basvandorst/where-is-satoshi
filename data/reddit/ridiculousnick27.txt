I signed up for the one time password security card (forget the name of it)

I lost 7 btc with gox….I was lucky enough to withdraw my coins a few days before the suspension of withdrawals was issued. I sent the coins to my chain wallet, withdrew from my chain wallet to a 3rd wallet, and then spent the btc from the 3rd party wallet. A couple days later, I noticed my Blockchain wallet was completely empty and gox had the remainder of my coins!!!! I did not initiate this ! Gox suspended withdrawals, and you know how the rest of the story goes.  NO WAY IN HELL would I ever use gox again. I don't care if the pope and Oprah were running your new exchange. I think I speak for everyone when I say, "We are NOT buying the horseshit malleabity hacker story"! How does a company who does monthly audits, with 6 different cold storage wallets in 6 different locations with multiple security features, lose 750 THOUSAND of it's customers btc's and not notice it until it's too late?????? It was a heist, a scam, a robbery! No way I'm getting burnt twice, and the only way Mark has any chance of saving his name or living a somewhat decent life, is by listening to "the people"! We created MtGox and he has the power to let us create a new one. A new one : ran by "the people", having "the people's" best interest at heart! So if you read this, Mr. Ceo, I hope you see that this is a MAJOR opportunity to right your ALMOST unfathomable wrong! You have a chance NOW, and we are kind enough to even give you another chance; so do THE RIGHT THING and help us so that we can fix the problem you helped to create!  This is about  undoing the harm you have caused people all over the globe! You now have a chance to give people their lives back! We are not asking-this opportunity will not last forever and it IS THE BEST option you have!!!!!!!!!

This happened to a protester who flew all the way from the states to Japan. He spoke to Keople's right hand man and the next day was told "check your account, we fixed it!".  When he went to his account he noticed gox had pulled all the coins(the ones he withdrew 4 days before they put a hold on withdrawals....approx. same time I withdrew) back into his account and now they are stuck there!! Apparently this is possible and has happened to others.

because the remaining balance in my account went back to gox.  I only have 2 wallets where I store coins, Bchain and gox.  I attached all the details on the main forum showing transaction confirmations and such.

I never sent the coins back to gox...why would I have done this knowing gox was having all the issues that had and btc's would be stuck.  Also, I felt relieved that I was able to get my coins out of gox before the withdrawals were blocked.  If my bchain account was compromised (which I  am 100% certain it wasn't) Why would the hacker kindly send my coins back to my gox address??? lol that theory is obviously not a strong one.  So after reviewing this, is it possible that I could have withdrawn 6.4 from gox to bchain wallet, Spent 1.4 btc elsewhere, and then somehow gox pulled the remaining coins back from bchain wallet to their wallet???? That doesn't seem possible but I'm showing proof of what happened! And I didn't get drunk or something and ACCIDENTALLY send my coins back to gox like a dumbass.  So can anyone explain this, or is this part of the malleability issue that no one can seem to accept???

Mark is done making plans! His time is up….he deserves no more of our patience. I'm completely out of patience and done waiting on MtGox to come up with a solution. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:32:33
If I had known the US held any of gox's cold storage, I would have ran as far away as I could. Whats crazy is that the same country (USA) that was "protecting it's citizens" by cutting them off from transactions with MtGox is now going to protect MtGox from US Citizens' litigations by letting Gox file a Chapter 15 here in the states!!!! WTF   The government is involved in this somehow/someway!!! It's a shame they can get away with anything!!!
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:30:10
Yes, they ended up back in my gox account
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:40:59
I see, Sorry I misread the article. Still have no clear answer as to how my coins moved to bchain, then after spending 1.4 btc , the remainder majically appears back on gox. I have to get my password out of my safe and type it into bchain because it is too long to remember. I didn't accidentally do this and forget. You couldn't have paid me to send funds to gox with all the chatter going on.  I honestly thought I was in the clear and had lucked up...looks like I just lost 5 btc instead! :(
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:03:43
is anyone able to answer this mystery???????? How did my coins reverse back to gox???????????
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:28:48
Yes, I have 2fa enabled on block chain, and yes the exact amount remaining on BChain is what appeared back in Gox 4 days later. I did order the 1 time password security card from gox, but this was after funds had cleared through bchain if I remember correctly. Could that have caused a reversal?  And i'm 99.99999% positive that no one hacked me. Why would they hack me and send coins back to MY wallet? lol I still have the coins, they are just in gox now and not where I want them to be, hence the reason I moved them to chain. Bchain is claiming they had nothing to do with this and gox isn't responding, so I'm just trying to figure out how this happened and if this is part of the "Malleability" issue?
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:06:00
Umm....because I checked my gox wallet and they were in there. lol 
yes i'm 2fa enabled
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:21:59
We should start a bitcoinbuilder site that solely bets on the probability of this happening. I'll bet 50k goxcoins!
