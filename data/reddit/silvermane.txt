I was curious to this as well. Wondering is a miner is being generous and clearing out low fee transactions or are they just being dropped.

I appreciate this comment.

While true, the price has followed the 'bubble chart' many times in these years, each time returning to the mean and then increases much higher. This 20,000 ATH could just be the bear trap for all you know.

Thats... not how it works. Buying/selling futures doesn't add to the bitcoin price at all
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:00:09
I saw this chart posted all the time on a year ago, when we saw tse:weed go from $2 to $15... year later its at $20. Anyone who bought at the peak of the "bubble" then still has decent gains a year later.

Yes I do know how many have been mined as well. I'm wondering how many people buy a little bit and hold/forget/lose. Having less and less active bitcoin for sale could also be why we are pushing the price up so much and so quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:49:55
What do you mean by "its much more useful"
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:57:45
How many coins are actively up for trade as opposed to being lost/hodl'ed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:54:34
Isn't it obviously the opposite. You lose it all when you buy and you don't gain anything back until you sell.

Two years ago someone made this graph 
very curious to see it now.

Not to sound too rude but this was a pretty dumb response.

Car is a bad analogy for a stock share. Unless its paying a dividend, I get no use out of a share of a company until I sell it for money.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:13:01
Yes there are ways we could use it, but as a collective we don't. 
There are two uses of bitcoin right now, hodling (investing?) and day trading. Sure there could be other uses but telling me those would be like trying to tell me people buy gold to use as paperweights.

Random question: If I run a full node will that help with the unconfirmed transaction number? Or would I have to be a miner as well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:33:35
Whats the benefits of running a full node?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:05
Watching Gdax right now. Bitcoin falling hard and gained some support at $10,250 and then fucking BAM, the exchange just lit up with people trying to buy back in. Just mad jumping $100's to $12,000. Crazy rapid movements.

Anyone using someone elses power to mine. Any teenager who doesn't pay the electricity bill and mom doesn't know whats up. People running power at work, yada yada
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:26:16
Isn't that now? 8500
Edit: nevermind, too quickly looked at the chart. I see its saying fair value right now is around 2500
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:02:28
Thats only if the merchants accepted the bitcoin as bitcoin and not fiat. I'm sure a lot of people just choose fiat.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:07:02
Uhhh this didn't happen last February?

Hilarious to see that although it talks about Bitcoin Cash, it uses Bitcoin core's price/market cap/daily transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:26:34
Why is that an issue. Government took control when they were going to go bankrupt and now they are reaping the rewards of buying them out

Bitcoin has been crashing since Mid December. The stock market has been falling for just a week. Not sure why this is being correlated together.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:52:28
"Together, Fannie and Freddie have paid about $90 billion more to Treasury than they received during the crisis"
"Fannie’s losses were a result of the 2017 tax legislation that slashed the corporate tax rate, making tax credits it held on its balance sheet worth less, resulting in a $9.9 billion provision."
Not to sure what the problem here is?
