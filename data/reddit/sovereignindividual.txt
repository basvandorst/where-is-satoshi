I feel that the majority have wrongly concluded that the economic chaos of recent years somehow shows that capitalism was wrong all along and socialism was right. However I would point to the following:
* in a capitalist system, insolvent businesses go bust to make room for the fittest. But what happened in 2009 was that the champagne socialist elite bailed out their way of business and life using value divested from us and future generations via money printing and kamikaze borrowing.
* the same methods have been and are being used to sustain the insolvent welfare states of western cultures over longer time periods. but we cant afford it? so what, we're *entitled* to it, its our human right ... we cant afford it, no system ever could because it's requires perpetually more spending than earning and value creation: **socialism**.
* consumers have been equally bad, living on unsustainable household debt because they feel *entitled* to have things that they cannot otherwise finance: a hallmark of **socialism**.
* the overt socialism of the USSR tried to do the same by laying claim to everything up front including personal wealth and value, but of course this removed the incentive for individuals to excel and generate value in the first place. The modern welfare state has survived a bit longer because it utilises "free" people to generate the wealth, then divests a portion of it (over 50% in the UK for an everage earner when all taxes and levies are included). In truth, our system, and the soviet system are fraternal twins and have more in common than they have to separete them. really we live under re-badged **socialism**. I dont see any real capitalism or individualism anywhere.

I heard JP Morgan were trying to develop their own, which would of course be at the behest of the FED. I would be surprised if the UK were not developing something similar. You can bet your bottom BTC that any state-sanctioned e-currency will incude the feature that they can conjour up as many new coins as they like though. If you think about it, fiat currencies are already the electronic currency that central governments can control, so we are already there in my opinion. what would be different to USD about a new fed-backed e-currency?

governments are just corporations with a monopoly on coercion and violence, except what they subcontract to smaller businesses.
authorities will always exist, just as they always have, but thay will get smaller, weaker and more numerous when their stranglehold on our lives finally gives way.
they will come to look more like the mafia protection rackets that they really are when their ability to tax and waste is sqeezed to a minimum.

Bitcoin isn't "against" anything, it's just an alternative money system. Perhaps you mean "the bitcoin movement"? Not sure there is such a thing, perhaps a "cryptocurrency movement". 
I think a lot of people share the sentiment you express, but that is people, not Bitcoin.
Bitcoin reigns supreme for now, but I think as governments turn more and more nasty as their monopoly of coercion crumbles, there will be a need for a more private cryptocoin, and hopefully one with a faster mining rate, as waiting a hour for a transaction to be considered safe is not great.

not sure why you think I'm arguing with you

"I doubt anybody actually "buys cheap coins" when the price crashes... "
wow you clearly have no idea about trading or short term investing!
you buy "when there's blood on the streets", and sell when its a euphoric circle jerk

This is the time to buy.
Bitcoin isn't a business that could go bust, its a currency, and seems likely to be around for some time to come.... 
It seems to me, risk reduces as the price reduces but opinions vary.

because Intel, IBM and marketing, while Apple was undermined by internal squabbles at the time.
Microsoft was there at the right time with MS DOS, and Windows 1.0 shortly thereafter.

I guess some people are just not ready to be unplugged, and will fight to defend the matrix.
