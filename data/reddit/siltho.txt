"Oh no, what gives? Coinbase tech support is non existant, my account is frozen and I still got 10 bitcoins inside, whatever shall I do? I know, I'll go get my lawyer and pay him 11 bitcoins to get my 10 back because I didn't transfer my shit."

They're not gonna answer, bro.

That didn't happen to me, didn't you notice the sarcasm?

Just because you buy the same lottery ticket every day with the same number doesn't mean you're gonna win. How dense are you?

No, man. I completely understood that. It was luck. Smart timing requires partial luck because you cannot accurately predict when a low fee will happen due to the volatility nature of the market. You cannot measure how the fees are going to be in 5 days from now. The only predictions possible are based on blockchain data from the last 3 hours, and the current unconfirmed transactions stored at the mempool. You can, at most, predict *likely* future mempool and miner behavior. From the simulations, it can be seen how fast transactions with different fees are likely to be included in the upcoming blocks. However, this has one giant flaw because it only uses historical data and thus can’t adjust quickly if the fee market becomes volatile. 
Another horrible scenario is when you broadcast a transaction with a perfectly reasonable fee for the current market conditions, but before the next block is mined, many other higher fee transactions get broadcast by other users, which essentially push your transaction to the back of miners’ priority queue. You could prevent transactions from getting stuck by using Replace By Fee, thus updating your “bid” as time progresses, though that’s not a simple solution for multisig wallets; users would either have to re-sign new transactions. 
Regardless, if you need to buy a coffee within the next 15 minutes and there's a massive backlog, you'll still end up paying 5 bucks. There's no way out of that.
