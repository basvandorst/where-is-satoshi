mate. try to get coinbase acc and buy litecoin then xfer that to get stuck into crypto. bitcoin just isn't worth buying with fiat right now due to the costs. i bought and moved £200 worth of ltc for £0.19.
alternatively you can buy btc there, transfer it to gdax which is owned by coinbase for free, then xfer out of gdax free. bit too much hassle for me considering how cheaply i can ship the ltc out when i need it quick.
i can give you a few exchanges to use once you make your initial purchase if you like.

i would definitely recommend kucoin. its the best up and coming exchange with a bunch of extra coins that you cant find on bigger exchanges currently.
if you'd like a referral for benefits, send me a pm.

alot of the coins that are about to start rising are often found on smaller exchanges first. e.g. not binance/bittrex
before you invest in any coin though, do alot of research. make sure that you yourself believe in the project and can see it being useful, and deserving of its price growth.
if you'd like a few recommendations of exchanges, i can give you a few.
