Okay, I'm starting to get a grasp of this. I'm tryin to make sure I understand it fully before using it so I don't lose coins. When people say 'backup a wallet' is this the same thing as securely storing the private key somewhere other than the wallet so that you may use the private key in the event that the wallet is lost/broken/etc... in order to import the keys into some other wallet?

I think people look for conspiracies when there isn't one. They've made it very clear that they don't want banks dealing with bitcoin, yet the exchanges keep finding loopholes. Then the gov't says, no not that either. Not really surprising. Why wouldn't they also come out and say that the new methods aren't allowed. They're not just gonna give up...

Hmm...I'm a little confused as to how you 'import' then. From what I'm thinking, it seems as though if you have the public and private key, you should be able to access the coins no matter what. Shouldn't any wallet be able to take this data and use it to move coins on the blockchain?

Yea, I've been invested in bitcoin for a while now, but I've just now started using it for the reasons I thought it was a good investment. I've been purchasing/sending money more online, but I want to start 'carrying' some with me too.
