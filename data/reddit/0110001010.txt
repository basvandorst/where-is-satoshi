High sum of fees == good for miners
High latency == bad for miners
High orphanage rate == bad for miners
Its a balancing act to ensure the system is being efficient but retaining its decentralization.

I think you mean it exposes the public key of the address you sent the bitcoin from, **not the public key of the address that you sent the bitcoin to**. The address is exposed because that is the destination that the network needs to know about.
@_date: 2015-12-04 16:00:59
Just to be clear, signing a transaction does expose the public key. This does not make it 'trivial' to guess the private key but does reduce the number of guesses needed to guess the private key. This would still be extremely hard with a conventional computer, theoretically a quantum computer could use this advantage to guess the private key in a much shorter time compared without knowing the public key. If you use an HD wallet, then you don't have much to worry about as long as you don't reuse addresses that have already spent some coin.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:14:16
With an average interval of 10 minutes, you could probably try the same thing you are referring to by hand and with the assumption you get into the next block anyways. Yes, programmatically you could do this thousands of times but does that really gain you anything?
Also, it would be interesting to know which miners are performing this behavior. I believe the default BTC Core behavior is the first seen transaction and all miners are going to have a full node their miners work against.
@_date: 2015-12-04 18:12:22
Not per se. In the olden days the public key was used. Since then, I would venture to say all wallets, perform additional hashing which is what the address is. So really it depends on which you use but it probably was an address not the public key.
So it works like this. You generate a private key PV and from that the public key is derived PU and from that the address is derived PU'. 
PV-&gt;PU-&gt;PU' the arrows represent hashing (SHA256 and been awhile but I want to say another hashing function too). The important thing to take away is that this is one directional, you can go from PV to PU to PU' easily but, going from PU' to PU and from PU to PV is impossible.
As mentioned above, probably all wallets will use the PU', which is the address, to receive funds. This releases the least amount of information possible.
When you spend the funds from an address you have to expose PU. This is not a big deal except that theoretically quantum computers could use the PU to find the PV easier.
So lastly, your wallet is able to know the balance you have because it finds all the balances that are unspent related to your address(es)
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:15:21
The typical full node will not forward an invalid transaction. So once a node has seen your first transaction you are still racing to beat the propagation between full nodes. The fact that the transaction hasn't confirmed doesn't make it easier to double spend

Changing the code is not the hard part. 
Making a change like this would require a majority consensus from the network (miners and anybody else validating the blocks). All of the members involved would have to update their software because not doing so would cause a hard fork which basically means we would end up with two running blockchains.
So changes to the protocol though theoretically aren't hard, implementing the changes and convincing the network the changes are good is much harder.

If you never 'shared' your private keys with blockchain.info then you are okay.
One can watch public addresses without knowing the private key.
One can only spend unspent BTC from an address if the private key is known.

Unless you are able to find a Credit Card Gateway willing to perform this action for you, your best bet is to just have the funds deposited and later purchase the bitcoins.

As mentioned, learning how to program is useful to understand what computers can and cannot do. So learn how to program. 
A simple language like Python is a good starting language; this is the language I first learned the basics. This language provides the tools to easily edit text documents and add custom logic to make a 'simple application'. There are also libraries available in Python that can be used to write applications that can perform tasks with Bitcoin.
If you want to contribute to Bitcoin core, then you would need to learn C++ and more complex, abstract programming concepts used in this language. For example, objects and pointers. The syntax can also be difficult to read.
@_date: 2014-12-30 22:46:03
No, a change to the minimum transaction fee would not require a hardfork. Only changes to the consensus rules (the rules that determine if a transaction is valid) would cause a hardfork.

Awesome! My first tip! Thank you
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:54:47
I'm not sure if you are seriously asking but I'll answer anyways. No, changetips are off the blockchain. Only when the user withdraws the funds from changetip will the transaction be recorded on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:43:43
Yes and no. 
Your coffee scenario is typically seen as a non-issue because the merchant should only wait until the transaction is broadcasted to complete the transaction. The merchant in this scenario is assuming some risk but since it is a low cost item, they are not taking anymore risk than they do with credit cards (because of charge-backs). However, if the merchant requires one or more confirmation, then you are correct. No blocks are produced, so no confirmations will happen until the next block is produced.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:57:20
Good question, one I don't have a good answer for.
For low cost items such as coffee, the solution is to just accept the transaction and assume/hope it'll be included in the blockchain.
For higher cost items, the full six confirmations is recommended (although at some price point, having to wait a few hours is still faster than conventional methods).
I've also read about ideas of creating a service that analyzes transactions and the blockchain to provide a confidence level that the transaction will be accepted (though I don't know if this is actually being done).

Yep, the two strings (because the numbers are encoded using Base58Check, so your private key will look something like 'KxFC1jmwwCoACiCAWZ3eXa96mBM6tb3TYzGmf6YwgdGWZgawvrtJ', I pulled this from Mastering Bitcoin Chapter 4) are all you need to store.

There is little difference between bitcoin and alt coins. 
The main difference is bitcoin is the first application of Bitcoin (blockchain) technology. Since then, many alt coins have been created that typically alter some part of the Bitcoin standard. For example, Litecoin uses a different hashing algorithm when mining and blocks are confirmed in less time than bitcoin.
Obviously there is a lot of debate over if any alt coins are actually better than bitcoin.

1. Humans. So a trusted-party system. Or some sort of escrow system that relied on both parties to reach agreement and a third member to decide disputes.
2. Or a bot that can process this information when it becomes available is some fashion.
So ideally, the information would be posted publicly (or at least accessible in some manner) so that a bot or even a system of computers could agree upon the results.
Something to note, the blockchain probably would be unaware of any contract but would rely on our system of trusted parties or computers to sign a transaction to send the money. I haven't read the whitepaper on Etherum so not sure how their system would solve this issue. From my understanding, their blockchain implementation is capable of handling complex tasks that would allow the blockchain to execute the contract.

You don't have to have a full node to generate a cold wallet. There are websites that you can save to a USB that will allow you to generate the keys necessary for your wallet. The file size at most would be a few hundred megabytes. I apologize but I can't think of the websites I've used before.
As for the Raspberry Pi, install your OS. Connect the USB that has the webpage on it. Open the webpage, then create your wallet. Creating a wallet is really just creating a very large random number. The webpage may have you move your cursor on the screen in a random way, you are giving it entropy that will be used to generate your keys (basically just trying to guarantee the randomness of the private key).
Lastly you can keep the keys on the Raspberry Pi, but you would never want to connect the Raspberry Pi to the Internet again, or you can write the keys down on a piece a paper.
Just remember, that the numbers you are writing down is the only way you will be able to unlock the funds. So be extremely mindful.

not necessarily true, the network can eventually 'forget' the transaction and will never be mined. Of course, you are probably right in that it'll probably get mined before it is forgotten.
**Edit: Spelling
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:04:17
The blockchain will accept your transaction because the address contains self-validating data and the network will accept any address that passes the validation. What I mean is only a small portion of the address is random and there is a portion that contains a 'checksum' which ensures the value of the address. The network will use only the address to check if the address, and transaction, is valid. It is entirely possible to send money to a hand created address that 'passes' the network address rules and is a 'valid' address.
The reason this doesn't allow someone to 'steal' your funds is because it is impossible to recreate the private key just from the address. So normally, the private key is generated first, a public key is derived from the private key value and lastly the address you and I send to is derived from the public key. However, the math only works one way and it is impossible to work the equation backwards to get the private key.

When you submit a transaction to the Bitcoin network, you are asking for your transaction to be added to a block. Until the transaction is added, there is a chance that the transaction can be dropped from the mempool of all miners. Transactions dropping out of the mempool occur based on the policies their software uses. From my understanding this is when they restart Bitcoin Core. Until the transaction is added to the block, the unit of account has not changed hands.
You could try re-broadcasting the same transaction, or depending on how low you actually set the fee, you can create a new transaction that spends the same inputs. 
I personally like [Block Explorer](
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:47:39
they could rebroadcast but doubt they would. Ultimately its the miner's that matter, their mempool; block explorer may have a different transaction set in their mempool.
Block Explorer cannot create a new transaction because that would require access to the private key

@_date: 2017-01-06 21:55:39
You are correct, it is the miner's discretion.
However, the miner should be trying to stay on the strongest chain so that when they find a block they will be able to remain in the strongest chain and eventually get the block reward.

You can't 'sign' a bitcoin transaction to say 'Hi Jack'. 
What can be done however is to create a transaction that has two outputs. The first is a normal transaction. The second is using the OP_RETURN command and this allows for a small amount of data to be stored on the blockchain.
I don't know of any wallets that come with a feature to append additional data.
If you know how to code a little, then there is a [C# Blockchain Programming Guide]( that shows how to add additional data to a transaction
After all this is done, you still need to use a block explorer that will parse the data and display it to you (I believe blockchain just mentions there is additional data but won't show it clear text, but this could have changed since I last used blockchain as a block explorer)
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:56:10
A hash isn't embedded with 'info'. A hash is more of a fingerprint of the info. You can validate that the info produces the fingerprint but the info should not be able to be retrieved from the fingerprint

No; you can't know in advance the miner that will find a block...you could only 'tell' specific miners about your transaction (assuming they won't forward) and eventually when they mine a block they could include your transaction
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:50:07
If we were to assume EVERY mining pool ignored all transactions, then yes it would be impossible to get a transaction into a block. The network would effectively halt functioning until an honest miner was able to mine a new block.
However, the incentive is there to include transactions, so the miners that ignored the transactions would be missing out on additional revenue for relatively small amount of additional work. I would mention that as a miner includes more transactions into a block the more likely that the block becomes orphaned; so miners also want to keep the blocks as small as possible.
If we continue to assume that miners ignore all transactions regardless of fees, then I would expect for transaction fees to rise because people will still want to use the network. If users did increase their fees in their transaction, then at what point do you think a miner would be willing to change their policy to start including transactions again, ten thousand bits, hundred thousand bits? 
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:21:15
From my understanding, unconfirmed transactions stay in mempool until the full node is reset, i.e. the transaction never get dropped.
Also, anytime you introduce a policy that drops unconfirmed transactions after any period of time, the policy will break the zero confirmation confidence we currently have.
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:29:58
great quote, the description is spot on
I've been thinking lately that time is nature's blockchain
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:13:04
All transactions when initially broadcasted are stored in mempool (RAM).
As miners mine they have the option to include N transactions (where N &gt;= 0 AND N &lt;= (sum transactions in mempool))
After a miner has found a valid block, the transactions included in the block are removed from mempool. All remaining transactions stay in mempool until another miner includes them into a block.
There is no guarantee that your transaction will be included in a block, which is why we include transaction fees, the hope is the fee will provide the incentive to include your transaction in the block.
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:22:46
I agree that a zero confirmed payment can have an double-spend attempted. This is true now and true with the proposed policy change. I would only argue that the proposed policy change makes zero confirmed payments a much lower probability of being confirmed.
A zero confirmed payment currently only gives a probability that it will be confirmed, however, because of the nature of a blockchain, we wait for more blocks to be created because that provides security a double-spend can't happen because the probability approaches zero (technically never reaching zero).
I disagree double spends can occur by giving the new transaction a higher priority or fee (unless you are able to broadcast to a replace by fee node that a miner is operating against), the default core behavior is to reject double spends which would stop the transaction from propagating through the network.
The individual that is going to attempt to double spend now are individuals with the capacity to mine their own blocks or know a miner that will include their transaction in the next block regardless of transaction propagation rules.

there is no 'cancelling' a transaction once it has been broadcasted to the network.
Your only options is to hope the transaction is not mined into a block and eventually all full nodes will 'forget' about the transaction (this should take an unknown long amount of time) or you can create a new transaction that spends the same UTXO as the previous transaction but then you need to find a node/miner that will accept the new transaction.

block reward and difficulty are two independent variables.
The belief however is that when block reward is reduced that many miners will switch off their miners because they will suddenly have half the coinbase reward but probably same amount of transaction fee rewards so they will no longer be able to generate a profit. If this is true, then when the 2016 blocks are generated since the last difficulty calculation a new difficulty will be generated. We would expect this to take slightly longer than 2 weeks because the hashing power will reduce but the difficulty won't reduce until the next recalculation.
However, most of this is assuming 'rational' miners and a constant price on BTCs. I would think that many miners won't act rationally and may continue to mine at a loss because they may be expecting the price to rise one day.

I believe you are asking the pros and cons of increasing the block size, correct?
The hash rate has been consistently changing (up and down) since Bitcoin's inception.
Con - Increasing block size should increase the resources required to run a full node which is believed  will reduce the decentralization of Bitcoin because some node operators will turn their machine off. 
Con - Increasing the block size should make orphan blocks more likely for miners with small bandwidth or high response time. 
Pro - More transaction throughput. Means more users and use cases.
Pro - Transaction fees should decrease. Means more users and use cases.
I'm sure there are other pros cons that could be made.
Core is pro smaller blocks. Others like XT and Unlimited are pro big blocks.

hope this works as one...you are trying to find a needle in a haystack. Hash rate would be the rate which you can examine the haystack to find the needle. The difficulty is adjusted such that you should always find a needle every ten minutes. So in the early days the haystack was smaller because there was not much 'sifting' power. Now we have a hundred time more 'sifting' power but the haystack is a hundred times bigger now.
