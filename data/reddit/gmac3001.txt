I'm pretty sure mods weren't just normal mods though. Those mods were/are most likely people in the technology world like a higher up comcast rep that paid for mod-ship or paid the mods to censor things. Probably a better/more believable example is Nissan or Ford reps censoring positive Tesla articles.

There was a post that 4/5 people have not heard about Bitcoin. This news about apple is only going to the same places where people who already know about Bitcoin are going to be. So people that already hate apple are the only ones hearing about this.

No one can see or predict a crash but the value has been steadily falling for a while now and just dropped ~$30 but thats pretty normal. I'm assuming its because everyone who is in is offloading since they made a bunch of money and everyone who isn't in is looking in and thinking its too expensive to get in which means a slow decline for a while.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:44:42
Yeah but there is also two factor verification so I guess if they swipe the card it would then send you a text or email to make sure so there is no risk in losing the card except for running up your phone bill.
To me it sounds like its still possible to hack if the person using it doesn't do much to make their emails/phones secure but there would have to be a thief who knows you use this, is able to steal the card, is able to get into your email and phone, then steal the bitcoins and thats pretty unlikely

Seriously, I mean apple already has his money. They couldn't care less if he destroys it or not.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:14:45
I think its because Bitcoin is worth so much that people who aren't willing to spend money can't really get into it and everyone that does have Bitcoin has usually spent ~$1000 so they are naturally feeling like they have to defend it since they invested in it and they are all about trying to figure out the best time to trade etc.
Dogecoin on the other hand provides no risk because it isn't supposed to rise in value and you don't have to buy in because so many people tip which makes it more attractive because people feel like they're making money from tips and haven't actually had to invest. There is no risk in having fun with Dogecoin, which is the point, so people are nicer there.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:05:10
It actually makes me sad to read some of the comments there. Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on Dogecoin because the fact that there is little value is kind of the point of dogecoin but for some reason a lot of people seem to think that this means value is going to skyrocket and are investing.

Dogecoin isn't supposed to succeed. Its supposed to be worth virtually nothing forever so it stays fun. Thats why they made it a feature to make Dogecoin infinite. Of course it won't last because tips are at least worth something right now and its to say, hey I like what you said have 0.003 cents but eventually it'll be like 0.00003 cents and it literally won't mean anything.

Destroying your phone won't do anything. Apple already got your money so they couldn't care less about what you do with it. Also, remember the article yesterday that said 4 out of 5 people haven't heard of Bitcoin, well take that number and reduce it even more because not all are apple users and you get a very small number of people. Then an even smaller number of people are actually willing/are able to switch because they took a single app down. Apple will not be at all affected by this as the community seems to think.

More people will use Dogecoin, but dogecoin will be created forever. More and more will be created forever until they stop it so in theory, even if the value rises, it will eventually go back down.

@_date: 2014-02-04 05:19:18
I don't think its childish. People are on the Bitcoin subreddit because they are here for Bitcoin, thats why they chose to go here. They didn't come to the Bitcoin subreddit to get tipped by shibes trying to spread awareness of dogecoin, they would go to the dogecoin subreddit.

It started with Bitcoin.

I'm not sure if its a good or bad thing that its more serious but still.

I think this will end up exactly like video games in ~1988 (someone fact check me on the year). But what happened was the video game industry lost 97% of its revenue. Video games were practically over then. A lot of people are saying that at that time it seemed like video games were just a fad and that that fad had ended, but then it rebounded and came back to become a very very prominent thing in society as in almost everyone has played some sort of video game. Substitute Bitcoin for video games and this is what will happen. Bitcoin, for now, is only a commodity to people, everyone is in it for the money and very few actually are getting bitcoin for the purpose of actually believing its part of the future. This will cause a drastic collapse in price and use but it'll come back as people realize it was actually good and what life was like without it.

I don't think fiat only has value because governments say so. I'm sure its more complicated than that. Also, Bitcoin isn't only valuable because people say so. Its valuable because its provides a quick and easy way to send funds across the world in the matter of minutes for little costs. Also because there will only be 21 million of them so people naturally want to have Bitcoin since its rare. I'm not sure its human nature or just greed that makes people that way, but when there is a limited amount of something then people will want it because it makes them feel exclusive.

The difference is all the other apps that were removed were smaller apps. Blockchain is the most popular bitcoin wallet and the app had over 120,000 downloads and they suddenly removed it with no notice. Also an app is designed to be easier to use on a phone while website one is generally made for computer use, thus more complicated on the phone. 
Although I agree with you on the destroying iPhones. Its literally pointless, if people from apple are watching then the only thing they'd say is, "Well you already gave us your money so do whatever you want." You're better selling it than destroying it so at least something comes from it. But I'm assuming most people here have a good sum of money that they are able to waste, I'm not saying everyone is but I'm sure there are at least a few.

I'm not bashing on Dogecoin by any means in the following. People keep saying that Dogecoin is growing faster than BTC right now, but Dogecoin is newer, less than a year old. Compared to it, BTC is a pretty established base with everyone thats wants in, already in. Now thats not to say Dogecoin won't spread to be more, because it probably will since its fun and ridiculous. I love it because it provides a relief from all the seriousness here and also, I can have some Dogecoin and it feels like owning something instead of fractions of something.
If you've ever played Game Dev Tycoon then imagine it like this. You release a game, then start working on another and release it a while later. Of course the new game is going to get more sales faster, because pretty much everyone who got the older game at launch are the ones who were going to get it and sales slow down.

I think while its 5% of there customers it also shows that Bitcoin is used for the most expensive checkouts on average. The average order with Bitcoin is $831 while credit cards are $686. Also there 0% of the orders are fraud. Its a combination of all the variables that come to make Bitcoin more valuable to credit cards, not just the one 5%

3d printing is not overhyped. This is new, you haven't been able to 3d print things. Maybe big companies but the public has never had the ability to easily print things. 
Now the practical uses are a bit on the bad side. There really aren't practically uses for the public until 3d printing advances to the point where we can print electronics (phoneblocks/project are comes to mind). But again, scientists can 3d print actual cells so thats a pretty huge thing.

If you aren't 18 I think a parent would HAVE to be involved because a minor does not have control over their bank account so I could not go and take 2000 dollars from my bank account with my parent since they control it. That parent wouldn't have a choice to not be involved. Although there are some places where you can make transactions in person via Bitcoin atm's (Lucky Vancovour) so a parent wouldn't HAVE to be involved as a kid could take his allowence and by like 0.15 BTC

So far looks like everytime it hits 900 it drops just back below to 890 ish. Probably some people selling before everyone else starts selling and the inevtiable crash.

More and more are accepting them, it's becoming legitimate. Even US government agencies are calling it legitimate and the government has a surprising non hostile look at Bitcoin. A problem though is even if major stores get them, people are treating this as an investment rather than currency. Buying and selling for profit, not actual use. Just a minute ago, right when it hit $750, it dropped to $670 because people started selling.
I think bitcoins are a great idea because centralized currency is failing. They aren't very popular as far as I know because I haven't seen places offering Bitcoin for buying around , but I may be looking in the wrong places. Also I don't think my family knew about them before today, but with the senate meetings and $800 price I wouldn't be surprised if they know now. At least my dad and brother as they follow that. I'm 15 and heard about them when they first started, I hate that I didn't buy them (my parents wouldn't let me) and sell them now, but realistically like a post earlier said, I would've ended selling at $20 being amazed I doubled money. Although I have a small attention span so I may have forgotten until today, you never know.

I'll don't actually have that much to consider really do anything with it. But I would probably stay in since it isn't like a complete ban saying it is illegal to even own BTC. In the future I'm sure if Bitcoin becomes more popular they'll probably change their minds as it acts more like a currency. Of course me saying I would stay in is easier for me since I don't actually have money on the line. In the end I can't really tell you what to do with your money

@_date: 2013-12-07 19:33:59
The first words of this news is, "It's excellent news for bitcoin. Essentially bitcoin exchanges in China and bitcoin itself is going to be treated as a "commodity" rather than a "currency." The first words say it is a commodity, which means you can't really buy things with it. I shouldn't of said illegal. I don't think there is law against barter anywhere, but it'll become just like gold. You can sell gold for money, you could trade gold for something else, or you can invest in gold, but you can't actually "buy" things with gold, only barter and it'll be much less common to find a vender to accept Bitcoin, just like gold instead of USD. And honestly, from living in the USA, I think I can say we would pretty much have no say whether or not the government wants to ban bitcoin.

(Note: I paid for my phone and computer myself, my family is completely spoiled (I hope)) If you want to count, that is 6 computers, 6 phones, 1 iPad. 13 devices that don't require constant connection. I doubt that all 13 of them would be dead at the exact same time as a power outage. I realize this isn't the case for every household, but as of this moment, I think that everyone who owns bit coin probably has a fairly good amount of money since they had to buy it or mine parts of one. 
Now if we're talking emp then we would have problems yes. But in the event of an emp that would take out most if not all of the US (maybe even world if space emp) so you would have much bigger problems.

This is exactly why Bitcoin won't succeed. People are treating it as if it is an investment, buying when it's low and selling when it's high to make money. Bitcoin is a CURRENCY people, you buy bitcoin and you go out a spend it like you would a US dollar. Hopefully as more and more businesses accept it, people will realize this and it'll stabilize.

How did you buy BTC under the radar? Did you go to an in-person exchange place and convert cash to BTC because as I understand it, online exchanges require bank account information that you can't access without your parents or until you're 18. I really am interested because I have some cash allowence saved up and I want BTC (only like 0.1) but my parents would say "scam" or "what if its hacked" and not help me with the bank information.

No. Crashing because Baidu isn't accepting BTC anymore, and China has a new stance on BTC. Not because it isn't physical. What do you think happens when money is put into an ATM, it becomes digital. And guess what, still has value
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:34:07
Just buy and forget is what I would do. Of course I don't actually have enough BTC to make a lot on investing so it is easy for me to say since I don't actually have risk involved. I'm sure if I owned 2-4 BTC I would also freak out.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:09:21
Probably not. Like I said I believe websites show unweighted prices/not strictly speaking real prices to make people go there vs other place, but when you go to actually trade it shows you the real price

Tip  Use it as a currency rather than an investment so it actually gets to the point where it succeeds 
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:58:11
You can just revert to fiat though. You are stuck with the cash on hand. That means the 47 dollar in your wallet and the piece of lent in your pocket. You can't go to an ATM you can't go to the bank. Your stuck with what you have if there is a power outage. Bitcoin would basically come to a halt but so would everything else, only difference is that in fiat you probably have 40 dollars on you.
Realistically if there was a power outage big enough to cause problems like this then you would have much bigger things to worry about. People tend to get a bit theify when power is out. Chaos would ensue if there was a power outage at this scale. Not to mention other countries that may take advantage of this power outage. 
Plus I don't think this will be a problem for much longer. New energies are being invented (solar power) and we'll probably run off a completely different source in 10 years because if you haven't noticed we are doing very well (have you seen China? Imagine that on a global scale. Thats what happens if we don't find new energy sources)
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:33:36
Just a side effect of it being a new currency. More people accept it, more it is worth. Problem is, everyone knows this so no one is spending. Everyone is investing and then sellinga at a higher price :(. You've probably seen how everytime it hits 1000 USD it goes straight back down because everyone sells.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:13:40
I'm also in the process of learning about Bitcoin, but I believe weighted is what it is worth compared to other currencies in the world, another way to say this would be its trade value (if you were to buy something with it, it would be the weighted price). While its unweighted price is what it is technically worth, but not what would be paid (This part confuses me as much as it does you). From what I hear some bitcoin exchanges show unweighted price to make people think it's a better deal, but I believe they actually trade at the weighted prices because that is their actual monetary value.
I hope this makes since, I'm not the greatest at explaining things

Should be safe. You'll probably have some luck with VERY small amounts of Bitcoin from people, but right now is not the best time for these types I would think with how the value just crashed $300 dollars in 30 seconds flat people are probably going to be more protective than usual

@_date: 2013-12-07 22:07:32
"It's excellent news for bitcoin. Essentially bitcoin exchanges in China and bitcoin itself is going to be treated as a "commodity" rather than a "currency." 
That is literally saying it is not a currency. I shouldn't of said "not allowed" though. It is more like gold now than a currency though. You could probably find people who would take it, but it won't be near as commonly accepted. You could also barter it for other things but it won't be "buying" things. Plus there are still a lot of people who believe in governments (granted not as many anymore) so if a government says don't use this then it they'll listen.

That isn't certainly not true. The teenage generation is by far the most advanced at understand technologically things. A 14 year old would probably have a much better grip on understanding BTC than an average 50 year old. Plus if a 14 year old wants to take the risk (which has an amazing reward in the future if it succeeds) then why should he not be allowed to take that risk? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:27:39
Yeah. There was a post earlier this week that was yelling at everyone for this. Everyone get whining about wishing they bought some when they were new and this post basically said that. It was saying that most people would've sold at 15-30$ happy they doubled their investment. The only people that bought at 15 cents and still have them are the ones that forgot that they had them.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:42:15
Well it could rise in value more than that, it isn't a hard cap I don't think. But we know if all money is abandoned then Bitcoin will rise to an unbelievably high amount. Thinking about this has made me want to buy a whole bitcoin as I only have a 0.04. (still 120000 dollars ain't bad if I don't get more)

Still unexpected deaths. But didn't think that through, in 100 years (if we don't destroy eachother, you never know with humans) we would probably have a new digital currency (or one besides BTC), or maybe humans would be invincible.

You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin... I have around $100 of allowence I haven't spent, maybe I want to convert that to 0.15 BTC. Also you'd be surprised how many 14/15/16 year olds have jobs. I had a summer job where I made ~$2000 and I could buy 2 Bitcoins then. And I actually think I would've bought a bitcoin around when they were 200 dollars, but since I'm 15 I don't have actual control of my bank account and didn't want to spend 4 hours explaining bitcoin for them to say it is a scam or not understand and say it'll get hacked and lost.

I too saw alt coins as worthless clones but I think Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin is worthless but it has more potential than all other alt coins solely because its based on a meme that a majority of the internet understands.  It makes people laugh, it isn't too serious and it gets people interested in crypto currency so they eventually move on from Dogecoin to Bitcoin, or at least start using Bitcoin along side Dogecoin.
Edit: For some reason I'm getting down voted for saying Dogecoin is a fun way to get into crypto currency and move on to more serious things. I'm beginning to think everyone is right about r/bitcoin just down voting everything that even mentions an alt coin.

Yes, it is technically that easy assuming it will continue to rise. I believe it is the next big thing, the US government is having meetings on it and TV news channels are talking about it now. But the thing is Bitcoin isn't an investment, its a currency, you don't buy it wait for prices to rise, then sell. You're supposed to actually use it, without this Bitcoin WILL fail and the path were going on is heading towards that. I mean as you just saw, it touched 900 dollars and EVERYONE tried to sale and it fell to 500
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:20:19

Bitcoin black friday is something the bitcoin community has been planning for a couple weeks now, hopefully that will get it more attention since it is actually being used as a currency.

You know, some people actually want to buy it and treat it like a currency but don't want to drop $1000 on it. Just because I want to buy at a lower price does not mean investment. Check my posts, I argue against Bitcoin failing because it is treated as an investment all the time. Don't be so quick to judge. 
Edit: People day trade with the dollar also fyi. Probably not anymore as it is on the way down, but they used to at least, when it was actually worth something.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:05:27
No, as of now the difficulty is too high for you to mine. You can buy coins (or even fractions of coins). Buying is your best option if you don't have a super powerful computer.
Edit: Source: Someone (me) that tried mining when it started out and it worked somewhat but I quit because I thought it was pointless since they were worth like 5 cents, I... I mean this someone was literally gettings 1/10 of a cent (Probably like $100 now) so he quit until he heard about it being $200 until he learned to his dismay that regular old computers can no longer mine BTC as it his too hard 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:45:56
I think a majority of 14 year olds would have problems with the bank when making $1000's of dollars anyways (drugs come to mind here). I for one, want to buy one and I'm just going to hold it until it becomes more popular. The more popular it becomes, the more it will be worth. If it ever became the main currency it would be worth maybe even 10k because 21 million BTC is all that will ever exist to spread over 7 billion people

Fishing for tips I see
Edit: No one with a whole Bitcoin is not going to know what an address is because it has been sent to your address. There is no way you just "made" a whole bitcoin without having deep knowledge of miners or having a wallet in the first place. I do applaud for the clever way you managed to post your wallet address and asking how you know money went through so people might send tips to show an example.

Okay, so they aren't taxing Bitcoin really? They tax the money you get from exchanging bitcoin. When I heard about government taxing Bitcoin I assumed it meant like when you bought something with it, and I wondered why no one hated that and how that would be possible. Thanks

No that was more China's news about Bitcoin being a commodity instead of a currency and baidu not accepting it. This guys address still has 87,000 so he wouldn't of cashed out that much. Also if he cashed out a large amount at a time, enough to cause a value drop by $400 people would get suspicious and probably find out it was him
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:40:43
It is essentially gold. You can't "buy" things with gold. You CAN barter things for gold, but since China said Bitcoin is a commodity that means you cannot officially buy things with Bitcoin. I'm sure you could find some people who would offer Bitcoin as an option just like you could probably find someone who would accept gold, just much more rarely than if it was considered a currency

Definitely not. I use preev.com which takes several counters and averages them. It says $1020 right now. Maybe unweighted price.

I think that is the exact opposite of what is happening. If something works then humans tend to stay with the thing that works rather than take more chances.

You want to lock them up? I don't know what world you live in, but there are real competitions every year hosted by science foundations or even google has one, where they find teenage inventions that change the way we live. Even the TV was invented by a teenager. Teenagers do a lot more than you realize, where would we be if we locked them up for 10 years? In a TV-less society. These competitions every year (just google Google science fair) show teenagers can very well make decisions, probably better decisions than you made.

Thoughts on whats holding the MAJORITY of people back from Bitcoin.
Why just target Americans? I think this applies to everyone. 
But I will have to argue with you on the immaterial point. You put money in an atm and it becomes digital. You spend money with a credit card and you just spent digital money. I don't think it is the fact that it is digital driving people away. I think it is more about the requirement of knowing a bit more about computers that drives away to average person. For example, when I first got into Bitcoin I almost backed out because of all this block chain, paper wallet on fresh ubantu (still don't really know what that means), mining, ascii miners, etc. There is a lot you have to learn to really understand Bitcoin and I think that is the main driver to people staying away. That and the fact that it is new and extremely volatile (as shown by yesterday, and a few days before, and a few days before that etc.)
Edit: Also what the guy down there said. Most publicity of Bitcoin comes from things like a massive crash, or some guy losing his hard drive costing him 7.5 million dollars (which turned out to be fake, but that wasn't well communicated) so it scares people away from it

*insert I don't believe you meme here* Sorry I don't have it at my disposal at this time. But you do not have control over your bank account until you are 18. There is no way you just asked for your bank account information without your parents wondering why. And  I'm fairly sure your parents would've been notified of 400 dollars dissapearing from an account (I think they have to confirm it anyways, in which case it would've been denied because they don't understand why a random $400 charge is being applie to your account)

Still. There is no way to possibly tell that it will succeed. There is always a chance it will fail. Although I think Bitcoin came at EXACTLY the right time to succeed, right when people started losing faith in the government (well a little after but still). It makes me wonder if Satoshi invented it then sat on it for a while waiting for the right time. I personally think any time before the crash (and even a little afterwards) it would've failed because the government was still more trusted then. If it will succeed at any time, it will be now. annd now I've realized I'm rambling.

With your logic "This money is going to be gone soon no matter what I buy with it" I should spend all my money now because I'm in highschool about to go into college and I'm just going to spend all my money for student loans, so I should just buy whatever I want now right?

Because  Most teens do have a job, you probably grew up spoiled and didn't realize this... and  I had a job at 14 where I made money and I got paid with a check, a check that my parents had to put in the bank for me. A sum of money I could not withdraw without my parents with me to allow it since I do not control my bank account. Pretty much no 14 year olds have control over their own bank account. If I withdrew $1000 from my bank account, not only would they not let me because I am only 15 and need parents permission, but if I had somehow managed to get $1000 from my bank account, my parents would probably notice $1000 disappearing or would probably even get a notice from the bank that their 15 year old kid took $1000 out of the bank because that is pretty suspicious with drugs and whatnot
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:37:17
It hit 1000 last week and it has been hitting 1000 several times today but it keeps dropping back to 950-ish. Last week when it hit 1000 it was the first time ever so everyone started selling and it did drop to ~500-600. It was pretty crazy, it had dropped like 400 dollars in about 30 seconds flat

This is why I cringe every time I see someone say they convinced their parents/brother/sister to accept Bitcoin for their business.

True, while I didn't think about this I think the point still stands that since China is calling Bitcoin a commodity, it will scare people away from using it as a viable option.

Don't try to do it without getting caught, they run your account until you're 18, they will probably get a notice from the bank saying 9k just entered your bank account and then they'll think you're dealing drugs. I suggest just telling your parents, they'll probably realize that you made a smart financial decision and then take that money from you (just kidding I doubt they'd do that.) They'd probably commend you but then say it was stupid to take risks like that. Although it might take  I wish I had invested in bitcoin when I first heard of it, but like every other 13-17 year old, we had no way to do it because I didn't want to spend hours explaining it to my parents to get shot down because it is a scam.
SIDE NOTE: If you are serious about cashing out, I suggest you still keep some, don't cash out all of it because if Bitcoin does continue to grow and be accepted it will easily pass 2K and if it becomes the main currency, then probably 10K since there will only be 21 million BTC in all of existence to spread around 7 billion people.

I agree Pirate Bay isn't as wealthy. And you can argue it is entirely different since pirating is illegal and Bitcoin isn't illegal (yet). But the main problem is that countries are basically places that other countries allow to be countries. Every country has to agree to pretend that you are a country because countries aren't natural things, they are pieces of land everyone lets you say is yours. The UN wouldn't let whatever island pirate bay bought a country most likey, I assume the same would go for BTC since it isn't the most favorable thing towards governments.

Yeah it would, but as of this moment with all the rise in value I don't think it would do much since people are just holding on and hoping to sell for profit, not actually use it as a currency. Bitcoin won't succeed if people don't realize it needs to be used, not invested in

Last week it rocketed basically straight up from 300-ish to 600-ish to 1000 thanks to the senate meetings. But it basically went straight back down because everyone started selling and like you said, it has been slowly climbing back up to 1000. Also, not positive, but I think you're looking at the unweighted price. I don't really understand unweighted vs weighted prices but I do know unweighted price is shown as more and I think some places show it unweighted so you think you're getting more money when in reality it is trading at the weighted price. I use [ which think uses coinbase's pricing.

And with there only being a max of 21,000,000 Bitcoins to spread around 7 billions people (assuming it does become a main currency) They'll be worth a lot more than $800 like they are now

Wait. I'm thinking about buying, but first I was wondering. If I buy from Coinbase at say $1000, then the price rises to $1200 would they end up charging the price I bought at or the price it is at when it goes through? If someone could clear this up for that would be great!

It's existed for 4 years. The US dollar has existed for 221 years AND is the main currency of the United States. Of course you can exchange the US dollar everywhere in the United States. Did you expect a brand new currency to be accepted everywhere right at the beginning?

Problem is once bitcoin is adopted wide spread its worth will soar because of the limited amount
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:16:43
Well it did cause the price of Bitcoin to fall over $400. So there is that...
Edit: To be specific, China's new policy caused the fall

Yea it isn't worth that much, probably won't go anywhere. Probably should buy some anyways, it is only 2 cents.

Well mine was a bit of an over dramatization. But it gets the point across.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:48:09
It is probably to stop it from crashing to 1. stop people from freaking out and 2. To make sure their money doesn't also go down. and 3. So people don't buy super low and make them lose money
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:49:04
More is always nice. Everyone wants more money...
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:45:35
I wish it would go to 5200, means $50 USD. Which in turn means I'll finally be able to buy a bitcoin. I personally think a good crash would help, because then everyone who can't afford to get in now, could get in. Besides, it'll go back up
Edit: I'm stupid. I momentarily confused yen and yuan.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:13:52
Nah, just want one. Idk really why

I'm not debating the ability of iCloud and if it saves things for an eternity but the service it offers can't be found in other places.

Bad Idea
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:43:24
I never get to see a bank statement, my parents don't trust me with control of my money I think. Probably for the best but at times like this I think it is a good investment. Maybe will talk to them, as the price approaches 1000 I'm expecting a mass sell and it'll probably drop 300 dollars again.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:30:20
It isn't BTC people trying to convice 14 year olds to buy it... It is 14 year olds who are actually interested in how to get some because they want to be a part of it. Every single day you see, how could a "insert ages 13-17 here" get a BTC? It isn't like we are begging for 14 year olds to invest

There are hundreds of Faucets so we can't tell you. But it was probably 0.05 because no one would just give away 10 dollars to everyone visiting a site

I want steve back!
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:46:34
Yeah thats what I've been saying in reply to others. At the time of posting this I was more concerned about what would happen so I wasn't really thinking of things like another technology that could be better used for currency that we can't even imagine. Like the thought of internet in the 1800's, no one would've known this existed or anything like it. Probably unimaginable for them. We'll probably either destroy eachothers because humans are stupid, or we'll be immortal by then. Anything could happen
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:06:17
Same here. It seems people don't realize Bitcoin will fail as a currency if we only invest and not use it as currency
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:34:40
It COULD reach $1000, if people weren't trying to invest instead of use it. It hit $800 about 10 minutes ago and EVERYONE sold causing the price to drop $200. Like I said, people right now are treating it as an investment instead of a currency (a bad idea that will cause bitcoin to fail if this doesn't change)
