a big company with relatively small payments like starbucks, google / apple market accepting bitcoins can make a very big effect.

i agree. 
sites know how to deal with traffic. the current ddos against exchanges will be a thing of the past in couple of months when the exchanges fix their code. My guess that in a matter of months we will see forex platforms converted into bitcoin exchanges.
we need to make bitcoin easier to buy.

1. tax AVOIDANCE is not legal. tax PLANNING is.
2. in many countries it does not matter where the entity that has the profit is registered. As long as you are a resident you need to pay taxes to the state. see for example 
3. Cyprus had many IBCs incorporated there due to low taxes. We know what happened there.

More like Blizzard, Linden and others change their game currency to bitcoin. players will have bitcoin wallets and could use bitcoin currency in and out of the game. 
More transactions = healthier bitcoin.
