Good try man

Common response: Yes for sure!! I love Btc and the world around Btc! If BTC value will go to 1 dollar I'll buy all btc on the heart.
Sincerely: No!! I bought some Btc only with the hope to became rich, I do not give a fuck about Blockchain tec.
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:00:16

I had 4 contracts on gaw since yesterday. I withdraw all my "gained" btc and I sold all my miners. I feel a smell of shit....6 sense
@_date: 2014-10-23 11:07:06
me too. 1500$ sent 2 days before the crash...
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:50:10
100% agree!! I would like to add that graph technical analisys is useless with BTC, just have a look on Tradingview, there are a lot of "experts" that wants to apply indicators, elliot wave, fibo numbers with Bitcoins, but nobody can't guess. We are faced with something completely new!! 
@_date: 2014-11-28 08:10:31
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:54:58
At least this is a joke! :)
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:34:27
Yesterday I bought a Trezor, seems to be very secure to hold BTC offline.
I'll let you know

If you want to buy a miner, buy one of the first made as collectibles, don't trash money in cloud mining or in miners (IMO)
I'll use your 1000 buying some BTC

@_date: 2015-01-15 10:26:50

@_date: 2015-04-22 13:03:03
You could use your analisys in this way: 
-Print it in A4 paper sheet
- Take the sheet and bring it with you when you go to the bathroom
- Use it for clean your ass after the poo
@_date: 2015-04-10 06:44:57
Hey man, you miss mineral.com
Homer is a full time scammer, no relax for him

are you looking for some tips?
@_date: 2015-03-23 07:51:17
I'm very happy to hear that. I wrote on hashtalk about 3 months ago and I said that was better to withdraw all your money because paycoin and other shit were a scam, but all the people on the forum insults me. So now, I'm very very happy. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 14:02:32
I'm a genius. I predicted the future 
P.s. the phrase "i'm analyzing the market because I'm thinking to invest some btc in xpy" was completely false, just for not to be banned :)

@_date: 2015-03-27 14:26:27
Is the Bitcoin ETF. Is like to have a certificate that represent the ownership of bitcoins (1 "bit share" is for 0.1 Btc) but not the "phisical" Btc.
