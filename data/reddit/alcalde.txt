What if instead of coffee beans they're using bat guano?

As opposed to this one? Seriously, this is like a post 30 minutes after it hit the iceberg asking why people are so negative about the Titanic. 
It got the reputation it deserved. People used bitcoin for shady things and the same lack of regulation they touted as libertarian Utopia led to the Mt. Gox incident. That and the fact that the entire market is manipulated by puppet accounts and there's a few people holding most of the bitcoins (probably the founder(s)). The question to be asked is after all of this who are the people who think it deserves a good reputation?

No, it's "the way the government works". This is POLICY. The FCC already has the power to regulate communications. This was a POLICY CHANGE in how they're going to regulate broadband internet. The Army doesn't need a law passed to change the Army Ranger's uniform either.


Umm.... never?


So there are two types of people... those who agree with you, and those who would otherwise agree with you but are paid to publicly disagree with you? And "the government" employs legions on these people to disagree with some random person on a message board? And... you want to be taken seriously?
