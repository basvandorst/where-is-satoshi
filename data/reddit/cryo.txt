How about:
1. Terminal displays amount.
2. User inserts card.
3. User enters pin, presses OK.
4. Remove card. Done.
This is how it works in Denmark, at least.

This isn't a tag, it's a signer. It can't simply be "read".

Or just use credit cards etc. Sure, it doesn't work in Kathmandu, but neither will bitcoin.

effects *could* be used in this particular sentence (which would change the meaning), but... yeah, it probably should have been affects (wiktionary: To make or bring about; to implement.  Example: The best way to effect change is to work with existing stakeholders.)

lolololok but seriously, the fraud is not related to the ApplePay part of the system, but to the banks' own credit card verification process.

That's nonsensial to say. Nothing has absolute value, everything increases or decreases in value compared to something else.

The fraud is at the credit card level, not really associated with ApplyPay.

Could you possible post anything more biased? I doubt it. Also, what the hell is this shit?


"Bascially", meaning in your interpretation.


I'm willing to bet that they are not. It may come as a surprise, but disagreeing with you doesn't make people insane.


Yeah, that's the romantic version, but in reality it's based a lot on consensus and how much authority people place in the developers of the software.

That's what you guys always say when people disagree with you. Sure, they probably don't understand all the details, but the same goes for almost everyone here, I bet :p
