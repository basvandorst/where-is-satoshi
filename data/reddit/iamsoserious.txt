As someone who briefly did a stint at CCBill, chargebacks are the biggest issue for any site. If it gets above a certain percentage the payment processor will cut you off.

Costco does not make a colossal profit. Just like amazon, they employ the tactic of making up for low margins by selling large volumes of items  (ie in this case bulk) and driving customer loyalty.

Seriously with the feds watching silk road so closely and bitcoin having an unprecedented ability to keep track of transactions if I were a politician I wouldn't touch bitcoin with a 10 foot pole.

This just seems like a last minute scramble. They can throw it whichever way they want, but they never admit to actually testing their devices.
I still don't believe they have a product ready for testing yet. Saying something like "oh it was a conservative estimate, but all along we planned to do a firmware upgrade allowing for 50% increased performance" sounds like a bunch of crap. At least the bASIC is much more realistic in which they announced that the cost of doubling the chip count was possible while not cutting too much into profits after a discussion with the fab team.
Anyways just a bunch of talk coming from all parties, I can't wait to see some actual devices in the wild.
@_date: 2012-11-17 16:56:39
Have they shown an actual working device yet? I've been seeing pictures of the PCB board for about a month now, but still no working devices.
I want them to verify their hashrate and power claims!

cgminer, use set the intensity to "d" which means dynamic. This will scale based on use. For example I can go play cs:go while mining which will set my intensity automatically to -7 (ie don't use it) while cs:go is running. Once I exit the game it will automatically change the intensity to a higher number (usually 6 for me).

sponsorship? Or maybe simply just bias to BFL. Notice how they don't cover any of the other ASIC manufactures. Since covering other groups would actually increase his view count my guess is its more sponsorship than bias.

I don't think BFL is scamming, but I think whoever is running their PR campaign is very deceitful and will give as many half truths as possible in an attempt to stay ahead of the competition.
My guess is their preorders have been dying off due to the expected significant backlog and they are trying to show as quickly as possible that they have rapid fabrication capabilities.
The problem is BFL goes about showing this in a way that is very sneaky and results in the company looking like a scam or at the very least not trustworthy. 
Someone with half a brain in regards to PR needs to take over their PR before that self-implode with all these silly, needless mistakes that only serves to hurt their reputation.

I feel like the quoted text is too close to the age of Shor's algorithm to be taking it into account. The quote text was published in 1996 and shores algorithm was discovered in 1994. It seems there may be potential in utilizing it to break AES256 once quantum computers exist.. 
I'll preface this is with just what I found with random browsing and I am no way an expert in cryptography.

Cash has significantly more uses than bitcoin. At the moment one of the major uses for bitcoin is for silk road type purchases. Until bitcoin obtains greater wide spread adoption this illicit drug trade will be a threat to the stability of bitcoin itself.
This is an issue I think many have realized and are trying to promote others to use and treat bitcoin like cash to make purchase that are not drug related.

BFL is probably too far along in their process to change their specs, their only real options are to either a) lower the price b) increase clock speed which means higher temp, lower power efficiency and possible lower lifetime or c) do nothing
I am going to bet that they will pick option c for now since this news basically guarantees that in terms of production they are far ahead of bASIC for delivery (unless Tom at bASIC is a wizard and can really get a product from being at the design stage to production within 1 month)
BFL will probably lower their prices once both bASIC and their equipment is out
@_date: 2012-10-04 19:16:14
I thought bitcoins biggest problem was that the majority if its value is due to an illicit drug trade.

No. In the end it brings stability to the market.

Does 1 watt/gh make sense? Is that a realistic number? Your power estimate is 2-10 watts/gh which is obviously significantly different. BFL has a history of significantly under estimating power consumption. What are your thoughts on this?
In 2 years what sort of speed do you expect from asics? Will we all be rocking 1-5 Th rigs for $1k or will there be some sort of finalized "goal" rate?

Except for the whole fact that on bitcointalk users create bitcoin bounties for software developers to create much needed applications.
Additionally, you can also pitch ideas and as for support/loans and if deemed credible people will help/go in business with you.

So the bitcoin network would still basically come to a standstill if a quantum computing existed. However, the flexibility of bitcoin allows for security of upgrades (is it really an upgrade or an entirely new system of cryptocurrency?) and in the meantime there is a secure way of storing our bitcoins until then.
Granted, I doubt a quantum computer would just appear overnight, so my guess is this is something that could be taken care of well before commercially or even research grade quantum computers come into existence.
Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2012-09-30 16:13:09
Not a chance. 
This seems more likely a way for kids who are having their parents pay their cell phone bills to get free bitcoins and buy drugs. I imagine the level of fraud will be significant for you.

All aboard the hype train!
Here is the actual press release
Which interestingly quotes a paper from early 2012 from the New Journal of Physics (which has a relatively low impact factor) indicating this this "break through" doesn't have as much impact as their hype train suggests. 
Also, quantum computing would be disastrous for bitcoin (and basically the entire security industry).

If you actually read the article instead of the sensationalized title, you will see the idea is to punish (commercial banks) for sitting on borrowed money from the government in an attempt to essentially "force" them to give out loans to people/businesses rather than using leverage to play with the financial markets.

@_date: 2013-01-13 18:07:55
Because you blindly obey a set of rules without thinking about the specific situation? 
My bad for trying to make sure any potential readers of r/bitcoin who have a pre-order of a bASIC unit are in the know to ask for a charge back. The situation is so bad that the owner of ozcoin sent an e-mail out to all of his users saying to issue a chargeback and the bitcoin forum mod stickied a post saying the same thing. This is all because the owner the bASIC project refuses to do any sort of mass e-mail to all customers with an update about the state of the company..
But.. none of that matters right.. lets just blindly follow rules set in motion by a select few.. without ever considering specific situations.
@_date: 2013-01-13 17:55:25

bASIC (an ASIC mining device that should be significantly more efficient more than any gpu.. we are talking 1 gh/s per watt when even the most efficient gpu's are like 2 mh/s per watt) took preorders for approx 5 months and had continual delays after a supposed November launch date. Then owner of the company posted a drunk message on the public forums for the company saying Chinese New Year would delay.. then a few hours later posted saying he would sell the company to new mysterious Chinese  company.. then a day later said he was selling it to people in the bitcoin community.
Fast forward about a week and he was suppose to meet with the few people from the bitcoin community who wanted to buy bASIC out if it had an actual technological progress since Tom had been saying bASIC was basically done and just needed to go to a fab in China for production...
Well Tom never met with those people, didn't show up..seemed to skip town..
There is probably a lot more to this story, but I just hope everyone is able to get their money back.
