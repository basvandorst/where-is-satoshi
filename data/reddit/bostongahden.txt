Well first, why should you trust anyone really? even btcrow can pack up and rip you off. Second, We really wanted a hobby site that we could offer a service, that we can run if we wish quite frankly. Third, we use non internet connected machines as well as paper wallets to ensure that things are locked up and fourth, we charge 2% that's what we charge, no one is forced to use us but I hope some give us a try!

We gladly will take advice from the community as we need the community
to thrive. We made some changes and we will add more to come. We have added Multisig to make people feel a bit safer and we lowered our rates as people suggested that the rate was high

^This, but really there is no need for online wallets. You really should start using a wallet like Multibit, or just have like 30% of your bits funneled into a cold storage solution
