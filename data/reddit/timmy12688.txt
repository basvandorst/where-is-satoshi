Haha. Don't worry. I have been buying every month so my average is lower. Plus I am holding for at least another two years. :)

Yes it is. When did this ever change. You just have to wait for  more confirmations to ensure that the instant transaction seen by the memepool is seen by all. Sounds like you have never used Bitcoin tbch 
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:25:31
Why? It is easier to call it bcash and write out bcash. To shorten Bitcoin you would have to say...Bit? And that is just not clear enough. Bcash is. Bitcoin is. You're just offended because Ver told you to be. I hold a shitton of bcash btw for full disclosure. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:10:32
Hmm fair point. I hadn't ever used it that way though so I guess I never thought about that. we used to have 0 confirmation transactions fairly often. We still can but nowadays people don't want to do that since the value that is being transferred is significantly greater. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:49:10

I first heard about Bitcoin in 2012. I wrote it off as just another fiat currency with nothing tangible backing up its value. I was offered a buy one get one free $32 Bitcoin at a conference and I laughed in the dude's face saying "More fiat? No thanks." Lol. 
Then I read the white paper. Everything changed. The blockchain behind Bitcoin is the intrinsic value! It is a permissionless value transfer protocol that people in third-world countries could use. As Obama said "It's a swiss bank account in your pocket." And finally, it is a exit strategy against the fiat system of the Federal Reserve which, like all fiats, is due to collapse since its creation. 
That's where I started. It is so much more now. In a future where physical cash is illegal, do we want a centralized system whereby someone who goes to the wrong protest, says the wrong thing on the Internet, or pisses off the wrong person can be completely isolated from society by being blocked from electronic-cash payments? Or do we want a decentralized, permissionless, and open sourced coin that doesn't care if you think the dictator in charge is wearing a funny hat? Bitcoin is freedom from oppressive regimes. Bitcoin was needed for humanity's survival and it could not have come at a more relevant time.

Look up Hayekian Triangles partnered with the Production Possibility Frontier. The money doesn't disappear. It merely shifts to long-term investments and savings. The economy shifts down the PPF. AND THEN the economy grows more. The PPF expands at a greater rate due to an increase in savings from before. That's what happens with deflation.

Government is the monopoly on the use of force. Everything they do they do with the great of violence and theft. To say otherwise is disingenuous and outright bending the truth. You may attempt to make an argument that it is necessary but like I said earlier I see it as a failure on us that we can't live peacefully. So I don't give a damn how the roads get built when we all stop threatening each other with the use of force.

Let me try like this. If I give you 4 quarters instead of 1 dollar did I suddenly increase the money supply of the USD? Now what if I give you 100 pennies? 
Now what if only 80 pennies could buy what you used to pay for 1 dollar a year ago. 
Because Bitcoin is a deflationary currency the value goes up over time. This results in perhaps needing smaller units of measurement.

That would be more wealth than the entire economies of all nations at that price. Or the USD has gone through hyperinflation and to price Bitcoin in USD would be like saying the price of BTC in Zimbabwe dollars. But like the other comment said we could increase the size we use to divide. We don't need to do a hard fork. We could do a soft. Or even no fork and just use a third layer solution for those smaller transactions. They then go to Lightning Layer and then Lightning eventually posts to the blockchain.

Now I see where the confusion is. Assuming none of those bananas spoiled or became lost if you put them all back together you would still have the same amount of bananas. It doesn't matter how many times you can divide the banana, what matters is the total number of bananas. The bananas just became so valuable that you don't need a full one anymore.

I wrongly assumed I guess cause no one but those invested care what it is called. Reason being is because they want to usurp the Bitcoin brand. That's why "Bitcoin" Cash is so importance to them to say. If they forked off and just called it Cash Coin and said their positives I would be much more welcoming of the alt coin. Buuut instead they are trying to say an alt is Bitcoin and that crosses a huge line for me to the point that it is like Caesar crossing the Rubicon.

When prices increase at the grocery store that is the value of the USD being inflated away via the increase in the money supply. That dollar's value is proportional to all the other dollars in the supply. The same is true for Bitcoin but the number of maximum never increases. Assuming demand continues to rise then the value will increase. But you are correct this is an assumption. Should the value decrease prices will increase in terms of BTC proportionality.

I agree it is expensive. However you don't get to decide what the fee rate is, the market decides that. It isn't slow. If you used .04/byte rate on bcash right now would you complain that it is "slow?" It would be too low a fee just as your $7 would be too low with current rates. It's like complaining that you have to wait in line to ride to roller coaster while others paid to use the fast lane. You are just spouting off Ver's talking points in order to try to confuse and mislead the uninformed, intentionally or not that's what you're doing. 
Let's make it as clear as possible. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are the same when it comes to speed and reliability (right now). The fees are different. Granted though Bitcoin has been around much longer. Once LN is implemented Bitcoin will be instant and Bcash will be the one that's slow by comparison.

If not, and this is against the words of wisdom here, you will probably be better off keeping them on the exchange. I've seen too many people lose their coins due to not knowing what they are doing. And since fees are higher these days it is harder to transfer a small amount to yourself as a test. 
Either way, you should definitely learn how to keep your coins safe by actually playing with some some amount of coin that you aren't afford to lose.

You are just attempting to show hypocrisy. In reality of course he would do what you're saying. Insulting China and telling them to stop doing something so he can do it more is smart politics. I don't agree with it, but if that's what he wants to accomplish he's going about it the correct way. 
Like the other guy said, it's not a simple black and white issue. I'm an ancap who came out and voted for once because of Trump. So far we've avoided war with Iran despite Bolton's backend manipulations...(emphasis on so far) and North Korea is looking promising for once.

If you think that's what Pizzagate was then you never dug into what it is. Did you ever look up spirit cooking with Podesta? Pizza gate was termed as such due to the FBI having symbols that many sickos use frequently; such a code words like pizza, lasagna, hot dog, etc. Try to find the FBI report yourself if you're so inclined. A lot of these key words were found in the leaked emails from wikileaks and really weird phrasing. The name was born and a lot of investigation into the lolita express was done and the name of people on them. A lot of those names showed up at that pizza place since a lot were Washington insiders. Then some idiots took that as there's a sex dungeon since they could hear a child screaming in a video (children scream all the freaking time for any reason whatsoever!). Then some idiot shot up the place. And now everyone "knows" pizzagate as you just commented because the media played cover for their donors who are sickos. That doesn't mean the people associated with Epstein and Podesta are suddenly innocent because of one idiot. /rant

Were you around when any mention on the news was a HUGE freaking deal?? Now we have a POTUS saying Bitcoin. Holy molly. We've come so far! 
Also Trump fan too btw.

Coinbase and other exchanges will open a channel to be paid millions of microfees merely for putting some amount of coin in the air. Seems like it would make sense to do and that would lower demand on the actual pool. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:42:26
I am wondering the same. Because it was difficult to short bitcoin before, soon it won't be once this is in place. It could cause the price to really plummet. Then again if the 5-year futures price of Bitcoin is being traded at $50,000 what would that do to the price? :)

Because it is theft. I do not voluntarily accept my income being taken from me. And what happens in the end if I do not comply? The IRS have guns for a reason. 
Roads could be easily privatized. Same with firemen, police, even defense. But it's a long road to Ancapistan so let's start with something easy like Social Security, Income Tax, Real Estate Tax, idk pick one of those. You don't just throw the baby out with the bath water.

I agree with him too though. And he's right. There's a million other things I could say stop to before I'd get rid of the government's ability to fund firemen and roads. Like corporate welfare.

Exactly. It will take billions of dollars to do and even then it would be a huge risk. Do they really want to risk BILLIONS? Which means selling assets to turn them into currency since no one in the 1% keeps cash lying around. They are tied up in assets.

Here's the diff. We would increase block limit for LN. BCash will do it because it needs more room and then it would fill again and increase again. I am not against raising it. I am against it for no good reason or for short term growth. I don't care about what the price is next month. I care if we have a point of attack once Bitcoin is an actual threat to banks and government printing. Centralization makes it easier for them to attack and increasing the block size increases centralization. That's why it is so important to be cautious right now.

No that isn't a good reason because like I said above it doesn't solve anything. You raise the limit now because of full blocks and high fees then we do it again and again. This leads to centralization.
We are talking about petabytes vs 8mb to accomplish the same thing LN could accomplish. Or other solutions.

Hang on dude. Not the op but let me explain because I was around back then too. 
There were websites like doorknobs.com. Everyone thought you were going to buy literally everything online eventually. So you have a nice domain name and suddenly you go to market and are "worth" a million dollars. Meanwhile you have sold zero actual doorknobs. 
Fiat has value because they sell cars and have a huge balance sheet showing it year after year. Doorknobs.com or thousands of other websites had no value but were still speculated on. 
XYZCoin is doorknobs.com. They didn't know about Amazon. We don't know what the Amazon of Bitcoin will be.

I think you two are both right but arguing different points. You're saying the amount you owe goes up. He is saying the purchasing power of the amount you owe goes down relative to the purchasing power of the original loan. This you paid less the longer you hold debt. And I agree that this is bad in a sense that we want our purchasing power to go up. Thus if we live in that world we should have loans of 1% or even loans that go down 1% a year. You both are right but want the other to be wrong so can't come to an understanding of each other. :)

Think about child labor laws. Did the government stop it from happening? Were parents just cruel parents and sent their children off to the factory because of their greed? If the government removed the laws now, do you think your child would be sent to the factories? 
Similar questions can be applied to questions regarding SS. While it was a nice idea, much like Communism, when the idea is put in practice, it eventually fails. This Ponzi scheme will dry up eventually. So what of the millions of lives then? We need to ween ourselves off this addiction. Anyone under 30 will not be paying. 30-60 still pay but will not receive any benefit. I'm 31 and hate SS so I'd gladly pay to make sure my children are stuck with this.

Here, let me help you out of the bubble you have placed yourself into. I know it is hearsay to think outside of it but try it out for once. You're not the first person to be fooled. Keynes only saw one thing in his General Theory and that is the "deflationary spiral." But it is just the market's reaction to trying to expand outside of the PPF by inflating rates to "stimulate demand." Yea, I've read your books too. I'm not a joke. 
At least...try to entertain that you could have been taught wrong...and perhaps for reasons bigger than both of us. Like... he's something on [tax cuts]( 
Try out a different way of thinking. You may find it fits better. :)

Time value money. What is valued today is worth more than possible worth in the future. People will always find a reason to spend their money.

1 BTC will always be 1 BTC and there will only ever be 21 Million in existence. Ever. If you can only get a hold of 1mBTC at a time, since that is so valuable, do you think that you or anyone else for that matter would care that the BTC had "been split up." 
But to be more exact, nothing was "split up" since the final supply had always remained the same: 21 Million. We just used a different word to describe the same thing because it was more meaningful for our minds.

You know nothing of the sorts. I started looking into Bitcoin in 2012 and rejected it because I thought it another fiat currency and it didn't fix the problem of central banking. I didn't really understand it at the time though and it took another year before I bought some. So hold your tongue. I had already graduated college and was working at Wells Fargo by the time I heard about Bitcoin. Like I said, talking out your ass. 
Inflation is a huge concern of mine and has been for over a decade when I first heard about it in school. So many people like yourself have this retarded idea that if people had to spend less money on goods and services that somehow the world would collapse!

In his scenario volatility would be ~2% deflation/year. You wouldn't charge much difference for a coke at that rate. Eventually you'd charge less but not for a while. Just like it is today with inflation, but you charge more. 


I'd say there is potential for, in the future, to be able to block people's ability to do business by cutting off their bank accounts and freezing their assets. I think being able to block people from purchasing things for wrongthink is dangerous and far outweigh any possible negative consequences a digital currency like Bitcoin could have.

You are arguing semantics. 
When the supply of money is increased, people have more money to offer for goods. If the supply of goods does not increase — or does not increase as much as the supply of money — then the prices of goods will go up. Each individual dollar becomes less valuable because there are more dollars. Therefore more of them will be offered against, say, a pair of shoes or a hundred bushels of wheat than before. A "price" is an exchange ratio between a dollar and a unit of goods. When people have more dollars, they value each dollar less. Goods then rise in price, not because goods are scarcer than before, but because dollars are more abundant.


As in putting the dollar sign AFTER the number.

I thought that the US would hold on to the SR funds for this very reason so it was very surprising to me that they had sold them. Maybe they have some of their own, or know something else is coming? Or maybe it is just as simple as there were assets seized and needed to be sold so it was business as usual as if it were a house being sold. (Most likely imo). 
I have heard of the UN and other countries/groups pushing for a single world currency. Maybe they accept it?

Never thought of it as a ponzi scheme but I didn't buy into it as early as I now wish I had. I passed on $20 bitcoins because I thought they had $0 worth of actual value. This was at Paul Festival. Fast forward a year and some time and I started seeing it as less of a currency and more as a payment processing alternative thanks for Stefan Molyneux and Adam Kokesh. Or wire transfer alt. Then the "value" was there and I bought in. 
Whether or not it become a currency I don't know yet. I hope so sure. But I don't know. I'm all-in though. And not selling.

It's more about purchasing power. And under deflation, your purchasing power increases over time. Our purchasing power has always gone up even though there is inflation but due to advancements in productivity and efficiencies in the market. 
I'm digressing for a second but whenever someone in here sees us talking about deflation like a good thing there's always someone to come in here, acting pompous and smug mind you, and to almost violently type at us to tell us how backward our way is. Perhaps you're right. Then again maybe not. Let's try it out and see what happens!

You will likely never be able to own a Billion dollars so why bother even trying to own dollars? You're getting hold up on the currency denominations. Try mBTC instead. Or Satoshi. You can own 1 mBTC for $9.11 or 10,000 satoshi for just under a dime! :)

I think people are downvoting you because they disagree with your opinion so I gave you an upvote out of good faith as it still is answering the question with your ideas. 
I don't think it would be that difficult for Amazon to implement Bitcoin into their system as they already have plenty of staff for doing stuff like that. I'm fairly confident that at least a meeting was held to discuss implementing it; if not before the Overstock announcement then certainly after. And the savings on credit card fees, and charge backs would not go unnoticed. 
But I agree that, for now, it would benefit Bitcoin more than Amazon. At some point though it would be a wash, and at another point, it would be reversed (to the point where it is actually hurting Amazon to not be accepting it). This assuming of course that all things go "according to plan" for Bitcoin.

It would benefit the people of the civ though thus making the people richer and so you have more gpt. Early adopters get a huge advantage in this. So think of the few BTC you may have now, and if the entire world tries to transition towards BTC. Those few BTC would be worth a lot! So by building it first you should def get an advantage. Also you don't have to be to ancap to build it since even communists can use civcoins. 
And it's a game, so it doesn't have to be 100% realistic.

That's how I am reading it. However, I think there would be theft laws to prosecute anyone who tries to do this. But if someone were to steal the coins somehow because of hacking, we are caught holding the bag of notes for an robbed vault.

Meh! You had fun right? Think about what you were thinking back then? We had no idea if that $1,000 was going to be just thrown away because Bitcoin was just a novel idea that doesn't ever become anything. $1,000 towards MTG cards was real and tangible at the time. And probably would increase in value if they were things like Power or Dual lands. 
I don't beat myself up for it. I spent $2,000 on Real Estate seminar that is worthless to me now. I saw bitcoin at the time too. But didn't invest because "It's another fiat currency!" I mistakenly thought. Also it could have gone to $0 and I'd be out $2,000. I could have 80 BTC right now had I spent that money on Bitcoin. Perhaps people will think the same about the $1k coins and think "I could have had TWO bitcoin... if only." We can only hope!

The more often you buy the more you will average out prices. So if you go monthly but it raised a lot in value over that month, it will be X dollars. If you bought twice of month instead, you may have bought when it was first starting to go up during the month (y+z dollars &lt;= X), thus your average will *likely* be lower. This concept is true for buying dips too.

Boy have you not been around the block. People here think it could reach $47,619 per Bitcoin. That's worth $1 million if you own 21 bitcoin. 21 million is the total amount of Bitcoin that will ever be mined. And if it goes worldwide adoption, there's billions on the planet that will want it... so you get the idea. 
They are correct if the demand ever goes that high. Whether it will or not, time will tell. But what I do know, is that you're a troll.

Snapchat takes a button to download on a device that millions already own. It is built upon layers and layers of technology. iPhone, iTunes Store, camera, face-recognition, and the Internet. 
Bitcoin as much as I do not like to admit it is not user friendly right now and has huge risks to an average user. Not only that but it is extremely complex to understand. Once we get to the point where we can download an app like on the iPhone and we can send bits/Satoshis via iTunes store is when Gentleman is Mooned.

Me too. It wouldn't be difficult at all to astroturf this subreddit and other forums to give a signal that the holders are weak. Pump up the alt-coin and dump it. Because they are extremely cheap the ROI is extremely high. It is much easier to pump something from 4.00 to 40 than 400 to 4000.

@_date: 2019-11-14 14:56:46
I think what you're doing is great for a couple reasons (coming from an older married fella): 
1. You get to figure out what you want out of life. Well... at least get a bit closer to it. It changes I've found. 
2. You are going to experience things most people in the western countries do not get to experience because of FUD in their own minds. 
3. You understand the risks you are taking and have a backup plan. 
4. You can land on your feet when you get back (especially with teaching kids in Africa on your resume). 
It really sounds right. Don't go on the beaten path. Make your own. Plus, I think it will pay off. Just forget you have it until you get back to "the real world." 
You have a way to store it securely in case of fire or thieves?  You're not keeping it on an exchange right?

Ok. Here's what you should do: buy as a means to save money. And forget about "profits." If you are so broke that you can only afford $25 to speculate on then just use BTC as a better savings account than your bank. Hodl until 2021 and continue putting that $25 or $50 away REGARDLESS of price. Buy it and forget it. Set up a bi-weekly buy if you need to via Coinbase.

Sorry but you are dreaming. Money Is it merely a medium to exchange for utility. We will always, even in a post-scarcity society, exchange utility and thus need money.

One in which they control of course however but Bitcoin could just be that powerful that they have to submit.

If you are then you are not a great one. Moreover, you're missing the entire point of Bitcoin. New coins are added every day and if the price remains near 1000 and stable that is better than a price of 3000 but high volatility. Especially since Bitcoin is trying to become a new type of currency. It would be difficult to have confidence in purchasing something or selling something if the high volatility like we have seen continues. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:44:31
Some Fiat money goes into hyperinflation. Price goes up. Any small country adopts BTC as reserve currency. Price goes up. Lightning Network implemented. Price goes up. Bond bubble bursts. Price absolutely moons like we haven't seen before. 
Any one of these are events that send BTC beyond $10k. Now combine a few and then bond bubbles bursts. Where does BTC land but the Moon? 
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:57:15
IMO this is a rally that will crash back down to at least these levels once everyone stops losing their minds. Give it a week or two (the time it will likely take for you to set up your account) and then buy. If it is at 1300 or 1600 then or something even more ridiculous well buy in a monthly amount of your paycheck like 2-5%. That way if it does fall back down you won't be priced at the peak. If it does increase, your average will increase slower than the price's increased average.

I got a question for ya. Why is this your response to my snide comment? Are you so insecure of your own iq that you think making fun of someone else makes yours higher? 
I made my comment because I get tired of people saying that deflation is this terrible destructive property of money. I've been dealing with these comments for five years and whenever I give an intelligent response where I actually explain the economic theory behind it and back it up with sources or lectures I get no where. It has its pros and cons same with inflationary practices.

First, I appreciate it the self-reflection. Yes. Yes I do. We are talking about uncharted territories here though. NEVER before in the history of humans have we been able to have a trustlesss system for money. I am trusting my bank will keep my money for me. I am trusting that the government keeps our money in line and not cause huge bubbles. No more. We no longer need to trust humans. We have math now. 
We live in a world where Donald Trump is POTUS. I voted for him and still find it just as crazy. On the other side of crazy, we live in a world where I can communicate with you instantly; with video for most of the western world. Where I can tweet the POTUS and he can see it or he can speak directly to me. Or I can send you money across boarders without anyone's permission. 
I really do believe cryptocurrencies are the next TCP/IP. It is hard to imagine Twitter and reddit when all you have is a bunch of links and email. I don't know what the "twitter" application will be but it will seriously turn our world upside down in terms of convenience and change how we think about money.

Pagers are still used today in hospitals. Bad example but I do understand the point you were making. 
[I know because it solves an important problem that was previously impossible to do until the invention of Bitcoin.]( 
If you don't understand *why*  that is important or the implications of the future of that, then you need to research more. I would know the Internet is going to work because I understood the importance of it. Hell, I remember thinking about it in 1993 when I was a 5 years old. I was watching the Today Show and they were trying to explain the Internet and the possibilities because of it. I thought "I will be able to play Super Nintendo with people across the world!! COOOL!" It took until the Xbox and Xbox Live for this dream of mine to become reality.

1. It was a subject in the class class that I didn't do well. Along with the other thing I can't remember the name of. There was a whole list of bs topics in that class that had to deal with "business" of things that I have not once used in my professional career. It was probably 8 years ago since I thought about this dumb class I didn't even want to go to. I even hated where it was located. Third floor. 
2. "my regressions class." As in, an entirely different class. I think it was IS401 or something. Again this was years ago. Also I need to re-emphasize that I broke up with my fiancee at the time. Was a huge mess so that semester is a big blur to me.

You don't have to buy an entire Bitcoin. Why would someone spend a million? They wouldn't. But millions of people buying a dollar worth of value at a time? The price would rise because of demand. Hence the price would be extremely high should Bitcoin deliver on its promises. 
Lightning is proving successful and the adoption is happening much like the adoption of Bitcoin first happened. But hey I could be wrong. If you're here just to shit on a tech you don't fully understand and not learn about Bitcoin I don't really feel why you're here.

Fundamentally Bitcoin is better than ever. Lightning is working. People are still coding more uses for Bitcoin. Halving is happening in less than two years. These are cheap coins. Anything under 10k are cheap. I thought I was crazy when I read the same number but under 1k.

A util is a measurement of one's happiness. Think of the Law of Marginal Utility and how you see diminishing returns on your overall happiness you receive the more you receive a product or service. But how much happiness I receive from 10 bananas may be worth so much utility. How does one measure that and compare it to the happiness you would receive from 10 bananas?

Everything is speculation on value. Some things are just easier to speculate on that others. I know a game is worth X now but will likely be 30% of X in the near future. Which do I value more? Having it now or the extra money later? 
Same with that $50. That $50 now is going to be worth more than $50 in the future. That’s why, generally, we’d like that value to be more than $50 in the future rather than less. We may decide to not buy that widget that breaks easily if that happened. Then companies will catch on that they can’t sell us junk that breaks and they’ll invest in things with more long-term value. All because we have a sound currency again! Yay Bitcoin! Making our lives better by merely existing.

I miss Bitcoin of four to five years ago when we all knew it was going to 100k or higher if it succeeds with its promises. But that wasn't the reason we were all in (not to be confused with all-in) Bitcoin. The reason was because we wanted a currency that anyone could use and not debase on a whim like the Fed does via QE. Getting rich wasn't the goal. It was the outcome. 
Now shitstorms like this convo happen on the daily because people are losing lots of money. I held from 1100 to 200 and back to 20,000. These people don't have a clue!

Depends on where you are. I'll assume the US. In that case you use Coinbase and that would be currency converter where they take your dollars and give you bitcoin. If you want it all on your phone there is an app that uses 12 phrases you create and then makes a wallet from that. Although I don't know the name as I don't use it. It's always recommended here tho! Someone will tell you I'm sure haha. 
Most will tell you to store your coins on your own but as you're new I'd keep them on coinbase and then transfer your coins to the phone app as you use them. Like loading up a debit card. Then when you are comfortable and understand all the risks storing them on your own.

Yesterday it was 11k though! (Not actually yesterday, but it could happen). So they just get a big increase in rent then? That's not fair to them.

It is a snowball effect. Right now in Venezuela people are using Bitcoin to pay for their food since their currency is devalued so much on a daily basis. You want the roadmap to a worldwide currency it goes something like this. It doesn't have to go in the following order, there may be other routes along the way too. But I feel like we need to overcome some hurdles like: 
- Small country with high inflation rates starts using Bitcoin as means to pay for food/goods/services 
- Major retail stores start accepting Bitcoin for payments 
- Small country adopts Bitcoin as their currency
- Bitcoin used as official currency for Olympics. 
- Price stability for 5+ years in a row. (To do this I think the price needs to be much much higher so that it is much harder and more costly to make the market move) 
- Hyperinflation of major currency 
- More third world countries adopt Bitcoin as currency 
- Russia/China adopt as currency 
- US dollar collapses 
- Fed had been buying Bitcoin to escape the crash. US still world leader. 
Idk. I'm just sorta pulling this out of my ass at this point right? Because I don't know the future. But I do know that having a competing currency that cannot be fudged with by people in board rooms is a good thing! :D

You missed half of it so it tells me you have a laymans understanding of Austrian Economics. In Man Economy and State, the book describes purposeful behavior and the study of human action. It goes in great detail of how humans can come to a decision rationally but can still be wrong. Ex: I go to a movie instead of a restaurant. I did not enjoy the movie. I had negative utility. There's so much more than what you described and I wished people would seriously look into it. If only to better understand where people are coming from. It certainly isn't going away. Especially when we called the housing bubble while all the "mainstream" economists were saying that everything was fine. Look up Peter Schiff Banking Conference Lecture on YouTube and tell me that is a broken clock that is right twice a day.

Ignore your downvotes people without economics degrees are voting here. You’re 100% correct though. The broken window fallacy is counter-intuitive to the laymen. People buy into this idea that “inflation is good for the economy” because they have to with the US being the debtor nation it is. Deflation would destroy the house of cards our financial market is laid upon. A sound economy has sound money. And sound money is finite, predictable, and unable to be pressured via politics. If only such a thing existed. I’d imagine it would be worth a lot of value as time went on.

Because then how is the code anywhere meaningful? It would like trying to write the Library of Babel with AI and then trying to find code in the Library.

I've watched that video before and taken some CNN classes. (not the fake news kind lol). What you described is for specific tasks. Example, finding the border/outline of a fish to then send to another sub routine to confirm it is a fish and not a shark. It's looking for random pixel variations and responding to what it was trained with during the learning phase. 
My gripe is how can you train an AI to code? Hmmmmm.... I guess you could train with thousands of code examples/programs and then use those as bases for the learning portion. And then use the code it writes as another basis. Idk. Maybe you're right. Like I said though, I'm not educated enough yet to truly understand it.

Still, I don't think it's out of line for someone to use that "$5 wrench attack" on them should BTC go the way we think it will. If someone knows you have BTC you may be a target and it's much easier to steal $50,000 worth of an asset like BTC than it is to steal a house full of stuff or paintings or a Tesla or...etc.

It paid for the wedding sooo they got it. I hadn't shut up about it since 2013 and my brother as his wedding gift for me put Tim "Bitcoin" [Last Name] on a big turvice he created.

You’re right that nothing can go faster than C. However, the particles go around the speed limit via quantum tunneling, think like a wormhole, and thus isn’t traveling though space faster than C. 
This is possible because the quirks are actually 5th dimensional particles that are coming in and out of our plane of existence. When moving through space in the 5th dimension and tangled within the 5th dimension, the distance is much smaller and sometimes even can be next to each other. Thus information is sent “instantly.” Well as fast as a logic gate on Earth. You get a billion or so of these and then you have your basic quantum computer too. 
This is all hypothetical and not proven in a lab yet. We will figure it all out one day tho!

I’ve been using mBTC since 2013 and agree that it won’t catch on. Bitcoin adoption is key to me and appealing to the masses means making it easier for the dumbest of the planet to figure it out. Only nerds were in BTC space back when mBTC was being tossed around. It made sense to all of us. But I agree with what the OP said that uBTC will cause the same issue. We skip all that and defeat the idea that “I can’t own a whole one” and instead “I can own thousands!” mentality. Plus it gives a nod to the creator. Plus it can eventually adopt the $ once the petrodollar collapses 
All signs point to stacking sats.

It requires $5million to move bcash's price up a $100. It takes $5million to move LTC price up $5. Hence why you don't see it jumping like we are used to see in BTC. (Used bcash since it is next to LTC in terms of market cap).

Because of the Lightning network is already shown to work on the testchain. What we are looking at is the TCP/IP which is the backbone of the Internet. Without it we don't have Altavista or Yahoo. Bitcoin is the backbone of the financial world. Obama said it best "You have a Swiss bank account in your back pocket." We are just excited to see what Altivista and Yahoo show up on the blockchain. My guess is it will completely change our world. Imagine a YouTube website were videos are not allowed to be taken down because they are on the blockchain. You know who is the content creator because you can't find the video before block XXXXXXXX. Blockchain technology IS the future. The days of fiat currencies and the bankers stealing our money via inflation are soon over.

Thaaaaank you. It was at the 13,200 target level for most traders and they took profit. It could have jumped to 16 or 20k even, that doesn’t mean the market didn’t overbuy.

Deflation provides a disincentive to borrow and an incentive to use current savings for purposes of long-term investment. 
[Here's a graph for you as well]( 
When deflation occurs, the interest rates rise. This causes [the investments to shift]( like I said above from short-term to long-term investments. This causes the [PPF]( (Production Possibilities Frontier) to shift outward at a greater rate than it would have previously if investments remained the same. [The economy in the long-run grows faster because the savings rate went up]( due to *deflation* (the decrease in the availability of credit). 
I can link a lecture on it if you are so interested. It's a little over an hour though. I'm not sure how versed you are in economic theory. I have my degree in this field so I try to keep it in layman's terms. Also I'm not a teacher and explaining things are not my strongest qualities.

Exactly the point. We are in the definition of uncharted territories right now. Bitcoin's value could be $3,000. It could be $300,000.

What you maybe don't understand (or maybe you do) is that every jump of $100 while it was under $1,000 was HUGE FUCKING DEAL so we would all celebrate. It would be a new hurdle. Think of the $10,000 hurdle you are feeling right now. It isn't crossing it yet. Now imagine this for months and then it finally does and it crosses $400. That's the feeling I get whenever I see this guy still. Haha. Now $1,000 jumps are happening every week. Up and down. Soooo I mean, I am not saying I don't understand your feelings on the issue.

Tenants will try to get away with anything you let them. And they may try to blame the $50 they sent short on "price fluctuations"

What is a 'Bubble'
A bubble is an economic cycle characterized by rapid escalation of asset prices **followed by a contraction.** It is created by a surge in asset prices unwarranted by the fundamentals of the asset and driven by exuberant market behavior. When no more investors are willing to buy at the elevated price, **a massive selloff occurs,** causing the bubble to deflate. [Bolds are mine]

You say this is basic but it isn't. It's actually counter intuitive. What you are describing does not happen in markets. The barrier to entry are put up via regulations and governments. How is WalMart going to force you to stay away from Target without using government laws or regulations?

Localbitcoins is a start. Or you can ask around on Facebook/your friends. You'll be surprised.

@_date: 2019-06-18 15:59:16
Since no one is answering you I will since I have both due to the exact reason you pointed out. I had Bitcoin when it forked and kept the bcash. 
In short, there was a huge disagreement between a large group of people and some powerful players (Roger Ver and some Chinese miners). Ver owns the bitcoin dot com domain and the btc sub as well. He used this influence to convince people that's there's a problem with Bitcoin: high fees and slow confirmations. And he had some legit reasoning behind it as well. This became known as the "block size debate" or "scaling debate" or a bunch of other names. Bitcoin's solution was to implement SegWit which "increased" the block size limit on a blockchain by removing signature data from Bitcoin transactions and also allowed for 2nd layer solutions like the Lighting Network to be used. Bitcoin Cash's solution was to raise the block size limit and will continue to increase it over time. SegWit was placed into the code and nodes had the ability to activate or not. After a certain % of nodes were signaling SegWit code, the Bitcoin network started to accept SegWit addresses. Those that didn't started a new chain and thus BCH was born. More or less. 
That's the short story and kind of vague in technical terms as to not confuse a nonBitcoin user *too* much.  
r/bitcoin has a lot of hate towards Roger since he flat out lies about Bitcoin in order to get people to buy his coin. He purposefully misnames Bitcoin to "Bitcoin Core" and [gets absolutely upset when he hears the term "bcash"]( (which I actually love the name. Tyrion taught us to embrace your names plus it's easier to say than """Bitcoin Cash""" in long discussion...I digress). He also says "Buy Bitcoin" and then gives you Bitcoin Cash.  
So the btc subreddit (isn't it odd they didn't just use bch, but instead keep using btc??) is basically for bashing Bitcoin and praising Ver and mostly dedicated to BCH. Kinda like how the politics subreddit is ""neutral" but promotes left-leaning ideology. 
 
Bitcoin sub is about Bitcoin but more memes and price these days. Which is to be expected for all the new comers on their first ride. 
Anyway... Honestly I like the *idea* of bcash. It's a hedge against Bitcoin should it fail, we have another coin to go to with a solution in place. We're in untested waters here. Maybe blocksize increase is the solution? **I really don't think it is** but it's certainly possible we could all be wrong about why it's more expensive and less secure. It's just... Roger really comes off as a snake oil salesman and like he's hiding something. He just rubs me the wrong way. I'd be much more in favor of bcash if someone else was champion it and being its leader than him. He does way more harm than good for that coin. Imagine Charlie Lee (LTC creator) losing his cool and flipping off an interviewer. Lmao. 
Sorry for the ramble. I can talk about Bitcoin all day.

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:12:56
It could. Remember that buy wall that was at $10,000? Well there is a price floor where there is "resistance" that the price bounces off of. Since we've had gains so quickly there isn't really any historical data to back up a floor's resistance. So if it breaks one, it could have a pancake effect that causes further floors to break. Spirally down and down. People that have millions or billions will likely not want to risk that kind of money on something that can lose 40% of it's value overnight. Honestly, I don't think we're even in the realm of their speculation yet. We aren't big enough even still. Maybe the people that are making $100k-$500k a year.

Who said that? Just as "only spending" is bad for an economy. There is a price for the future cost of money though and that is the interest rate. Right now it is pushed lower than what the market would put it. This creates an influx of short-term consumption, while at the same time, causes an increase in long-term investments. This causes huge bubbles. and the Boom/Bust Cycle. [More here](

It isn't "my solution" first of all. Second of all, no one gives anyone anything unless you are talking about the USD where politically connected individuals are given trillions of dollars to save the businesses they run via the Fed. 
It is clear you don't any part of this. That's fine. It doesn't matter to me. No one here is forcing you to own Bitcoin so I'm not sure why you are screaming so loudly to me in an attempt to...what? Save me from my bubble? You don't know my position, how much % of my income is in it, etc. 
In the end, it has already changed the world as we know it by creating [the blockchain and the technology behind it.]( This is revolutionary. And if you don't see it, then you just don't see it. I got into Bitcoin because I was excited to see the techonological futures and impact it has on the world. I love the idea of people in 3rd World Countries will now have access to a currency that doesn't lose value via inflation. And NO ONE can prevent them from obtaining the coins. I can send them coins, they can send me coins, no questions, no documents needed. THAT is revolutionary. And hence why Bitcoin and other coins have value. Once second and then third layers are added to the Blockchain there's no telling what will happen.

Correct. Go look at how many other coins there are out there. The reason why BCC has value is because of Roger Ver and his rep that he had within the community. Without him I'm not sure what BCC would be worth. And to sell it better, rather than just go create another new coin he forked off and gave everyone a balance equal to Bitcoin balance you had previously. He didn't have to.

The value is the Blockchain. This is a trustless, verifiable ledger. The likes which have always been pondered about but never created until now. The cat's out of the bag now though. This was why I didn't "invest" at $32.

Right, I'm aware of the halvening. I expected LTC to moon but it didn't. We could see BTC's price to not moon either as demand does not increase or decreases now that the hype for an upcoming halvening and huge gains is over.

Plenty of people would not do it because of their time value preferences of having the widget now rather than a year from now. There’s also the potential to earn more than 2-3%. I don’t wake up for investments that are not at least 20% ROI right now in real estate. Grandma not kissing 2% of her savings goodbye every year isn’t going to kill an economy.

The value of anything is based on opinion. You think your widget is worth $50 but I only value it at $30, we won't agree to an exchange. If I value it at a greater value than $50 then I will buy it. If I value your widget at $1,000,000 I will gladly buy it for $50 still though. 


Millions of people doing what I described above every second. Right now I am hodling Bitcoin. I did not value $20,000 over my 1 BTC. I do not value $7,000 over my 1 BTC. Thus the value is increased because I do not sell and my supply is no longer in circulation. This is all pretty basic supply and demand to give you the price. The intrinsic value of Bitcoin is the blockchain itself, its security, and the ability to exchange value without permission. That's super valuable in today's censored world!


Yes. Why not? Venezuela would be better off with a BTC-backed currency than their hyperinflated fiat. 


Why would you want to create a new crypto over Bitcoin? It will not be as secure as Bitcoin because Bitcoin's proof of work. You'd need billions of US dollars worth of hardware to create a network as secure as Bitcoin's and even then I wouldn't want to be on it because it would not be decentralized. So you'd also need an army to force people to accept your new money. Maybe you're thinking of a China-like coin? Yup. They can crease that, but it will not be as good as Bitcoin. China-like coin would be centralized and able to be attacked by other governments or the creator of the coin could bailout their users. Can't do that in Bitcoin! Which is the point. 


Didn't see this question before writing above, so I kinda answered it already. It would be 1,000,000,000x easier to just use Bitcoin.

People are making this too complicated. I am able to send money to my friend in Abu Dhabi with Bitcoin without using banks. He can then use the Bitcoin there to buy things from his friends like Magic cards or whatnot.

But you misunderstand. I can drive it just fine. As can most of the people I know. That's fine with me. The people that cannot, will find alternative solutions. If Bitcoin is too expensive for them, perhaps Litecoin or bcash will be an alternative. That's fine. I love competition. There doesn't need to be one coin to rule them all. Bitcoin works for me and my needs so I continue to use it the way it works for my needs. 


And we just disagree here. Fundamentally. That's fine. We can. We don't have to go back and forth about why bigger blocks are harder and less secure and then you rebut with your own reasoning which is probably perfectly reasonable. I've been done that road plenty of times with you guys. It's why I still have my bcash from the fork. There's a chance I could be wrong and I know this. I wonder if you are the same way in your thoughts? 100% confidence? In this new field? 


This is probably why you were banned the "first" (who knows how many times) time. There is no common sense here. This is a new field and everything is revolution. We cannot accurately predict the future anymore than we could say that Twitter would exist and then we would have a POTUS on it that uses it to transmit his decisions to the masses over official channels. Imagine saying that in 1993 and then saying "And yet I have a more common sense, and understanding about the Internet than you do."  You certainly did, but you didn't prove it, nor could you.

It’s like traffic. Building more roads means more traffic. And you still have the traffic jam. So we’d just have 1,000 lanes and still full blocks. Bitcoin will have “failed” and everyone would be right. 
Instead we can take a bus. We can use the train. We can install roundabouts or on-ramp lights. We could carpool. So many options. Bcash already has the Block limit increased. If that’s the route to go then that will win. That’s fine by me!

@_date: 2018-11-19 19:57:43


This may not be the case and I hinted at this in a different reply but I'll use this post to extend what I mean. 
Say LN works really well. 
Say another layer of technology is built upon that that streamlines Bitcoin payments. 
It could be that we can use 1 Bitcoin to transfer all the wealth around the world. All your coffees, your cars, houses, etc etc...everything all traded with another layer of tech on top of LN that we haven't even thought of. Thus that frees up the supply of the remaining Bitcoin and now we no longer need a huge price to stabilize. 
It's just a hypothetical. I do think that the value will increase over time to pay for miners and a whole bunch of other reasons that you could probably say as well to rebut my example above. And yea, I agree with all of them. It's just an example of something we could possibly see so you and I don't know what the value of Bitcoin will be in the future. And this long wall of text was all meant to say just that. :)

Weird how I have 100% of my assets in Bitcoin... Oh wait I only invest what I could afford to lose... IN 2013!! 
And permissionless-transferring of value has intrinsic value. You may not value it, but when I sent my buddy in Abu Dhabi some Bitcoin he sure valued it. And I valued the transfer too. A bunch of people do this causes people to value it. What does that price mean? Apparently somewhere above $5k right now.

It is providing a valuable service. It currently isn't; that doesn't mean it will always be that way. Water is pretty valuable and is "free" in lots of places in the US. Bitcoin may one day be that way too. If you don't like the price that it cost, which is still very little, then there are other payment systems available to you to pick from. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:47:32
But the security of the blockchain is backed up by the miners and their hashrate. Those miners need a token incentive that is valued to secure the network. No one is ( currently) mining Bitcoin23 at the levels Bitcoin is.

You seem to misunderstand why I buy and use Bitcoin. It's kinda one of the most important projects in existence right now. The ability for one to freely and peacefully transfer value from one person to another is essential for liberty. And PayPal and the governments have shown time and time again that they will restrict people's ability to transfer value simply for saying or thinking the wrong thing. Not to mention some people in board roams determine what the supply of money should be for a currency to pay for wars and other stuff I don't want. 
I mean it. This is game-changing, world-level events. 10 years? Civ VI will have Bitcoin on the Tech tree or a world wonder. And even if all the above remains true, that does not equate that Bitcoin is 21908529723% higher today in value. It could be the equivilant of 10 cents today because the supply/demand is equaled out so quickly it doesn't matter. I don't know the future, but to get rich is not why I hodl.

How many slices of bread could you buy with that dollar back then? How many today? The increase in technology would mean that you can purchase more today so you may not "notice the dollar decrease in valuation." However, how much gold could you buy with a dollar? How much can you today? I'd bet you since I haven't looked to verify, that you could buy A LOT more with a dollar then than today. 
That's the value that was depreciated away via inflation. The supply went up thus the demand for more dollars increased. 
Edit: Just looked really quick. Gold was priced at $403 and it is currently at $1,349.80. That's a 235% increase in price.

Been in since 2013 as well! Only thing to add is Dollar Cost Average (buying a fixed amount every week or month) is the best approach to such a volatile like Bitcoin. 
And just to truly emphasis the point further, do not put in more than you can lose. Conversely, do not hodl more than you can afford to lose. If you reach a level, because of a wild bull run, where you are not comfortable with losing the value gained, sell. This is a hard lesson I have refused to learn...three times now. &gt;.&lt;

Rich people certainly do not hodl. They invest and try to make more. If we have an increase of 4% in value every year that would be great. Rich people are looking for 30% or more for investments. How do I know? Because I invest in real estate and that's the margins I look for. And I'm not even really in the rich people's game. Those deals require $10mm.  I'm still only doing 32 unit deals. 
Bitcoin isn't a currency right now not because of deflation (it is still inflationary atm but not the point), but because of its volatility. If it is stable, meaning predictable rate of return, for a year then we can start talking about currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:39:06
I don't see why that would happen so you're just being pedantic to make your point work. If Facebook is less than a dollar it is because users have stopped using it. Or is MySpace super valuable right now? If people stopped using Bitcoin it would be worth as much as the people still using it. But it would be much more vulnerable to attacks sooo pretty much useless.

Right because people don't *want* their house fire to be put out. 


ROADS! I swear there should be a Goodwin's Law for statists and roads. It's like, in your mind, people are in their houses looking over at WalMart and just scratching their heads on how to get there. 


You mean how most of my streets already are? And how it takes months if not years to fill the potholes? But the street with the high property taxes just got a nice new coating that just happened two years ago. Oh and they are now building a roundabout because reasons. 


You mean like how rich people have a way cooler phone than you do right? 
Imagine a drone fire system that flies to your house when it detected a fire from your $29.99 smoke alarm you purchased from WalMart that is hooked up to your Internet. It shows up in 1-3 mins with anti-fire goo and flies on near the fire(s) and sprays its goo on it. It put out a fire and your "subscription" is now fulfilled and you have to buy a new "plan" at $29.99. That's something I came up just right now. 
But again, I don't know what millions of people coming together peacefully will come up with. I DO know what a few people in charge of a system will come up with and it is a big loud truck that sprays water in the air.

It's not hate. I'm hodling until the next halving in 2020 and I have been around since 2013 so I have seen "Bitcoin will be $X by Y date!" over and over and over ad nauseum. Long-term I feel the value is over $100,000 and even longer still, $1mm (assuming everything goes right of course \^_^ ) 
But when people say things like "experts say that Bitcoin will be..." it is a straight up lie! Then they use precise numbers too like $44,331.97 to make it seem like they calculated their prediction and therefore have more weight in their prediction. Tomorrow, the US could decide to ban Bitcoin and trading Bitcoin. What do you think that would do to the price in 2018? Satoshi's coins could move. What would that do to the price? 
Point is, there's too much variance and too many unknowns to be able to even remotely predict where it will be. And moreover, then it looks to be like a "get rich quick scheme," MLM, or pyramid scheme when everyone is focused on price. And then you know what happens? People get stupid. People get burned. 
I'd rather focus on the technology and the price will follow suit... all the way to the moon! ┗(°0°)┛

I've agreed with literally everything you've said other than you disagreeing that it's risky. 
It is. There is risk involved and with anything investment wise you should never risk more than you can afford to lose. Remember when Bitcoin bubbled up to $1200? I bought then too. I took out a lot for me then. But then it went to $400 and stayed there for two years. Yea. That was fun. Now imagine I took out a huuuuge loan. I would file for bankruptcy. 
that's all this thread was about. Bitcoin is a risk. Holding dollars is a risk. Buying real estate is risky. And investing means not risking the farm. That's when you're gambling.

Difference being a libertarian society would allow groups of people to share with each other and call themselves communists. Communist societies would force membership on the Libertarians. 


Just like when we restarted slavery once we realized how immoral of an act it is to put people in chains. It didn't matter though because the economic benefits of free labor and the greedy capitalist couldn't resist. 


You mean how I am forced to pay over $10,000 in property taxes annually? Sure seems like a mob coming over to my business and saying "Say...you gotta lotta stuff here. Shame if something bad would happen to it." 


We already have that. The police are minutes away. And we have AKs to defend ourselves from possible tyranny. 


And those very people will be attracted to the power vacuum that is governments. I want a decentralization of that power to the point where it is powerless. Arby's does not force you to eat there. It almost bribes you to come to them over Wendy's. 


A government police officer arrests you. You are taken to a government court, and put in front of a government appointed judge. And you want to call this "independent?" I realize we have jury of our peers as well but no many cases get that far anymore.

For small towns we already have Volunteer Firefighters because small towns don't have enough money.  


My brother is a firefighter. Some of his trucks he works on is a decade old and needs replaced badly. But they "just don't have the approvals."  So ok. 


You have it backwards. No one has to force you to pay for an Xbox yet they sell like hotcakes. One has to force someone to pay for government suits to sit in rooms and make policies for people thousands of miles away. 


I just showed you that we are already lacking. Wouldn't you rather know that if you give a dollar to Fire Dept XYZ you know it is going to that business? Or would you rather "vote" for Politician XYZ who will "promise" to give more of your neighbors money to Fire Dept ABC...on this nice side of town. They probably need a new Engine cause they pay more in property taxes.

I don't and that's the huge problem with "selling" this idea. But I'm willing to try because I am beginning with first principles and morality. I don't give a damn what society will look like once all the slaves are freed. I am objecting to the use of slaves. Your question is akin to saying "Who will pick the cotton?" and if I were to tell you machines that are 10000x better than humans you'd rightfully say I am living in fantasy-land. The way governments pay for roads, schools, water supplies, and everything the government does starts with an immoral action. The consequences of said actions are moot. I believe we can peacefully build a world where we don't start with an immoral action or threats of violence. And if it doesn't work out, then we'll be back with government again. But you don't tell a cancer patient not to try to remove the tumor because it could grow back. It sounds really radical when you first hear about it. So just think about it for a while. Maybe you'll come around. :)

I don't recall ever saying that. Maybe you thought I did somehow? I dunno. There's a reason behind this though and it is because of our deflationary monetary policies that we both share. The US and EU both think that inflating the money supply is the best way to run a currency. It is if your country holds debt and tries to inflate it away. But that only helps the 1% of the nation and not the everyday poor person (who is thus affected the most because their costs go up more). I want competing currencies again. Prices used to go down! Not up! Can you imagine if someone saved their $100 and then next month the item they were saving for now cost $98. And so on for months and months? That would help the poor a lot. 


Hahaha. Sorry for laughing but this is literally my and so many other people's stories here. I have worked extremely hard to get where I am today. Though I am not "rich" I am going to go out on a limb and say I make more than 95% of redditors. And I grew up adopted and with a single mother. If I can do it, so can anyone else. 


More collectivist bullshit. If Steve Jobs gets rich making the iPhone wouldn't you say that our lives are better off because of it? My life is certainly more fulfilling being able to stream music, read books, and browse the Internet whenever I want. And you know what? Bill Gates and I buy the same iPhone. He doesn't get a better one because he's rich. 
"Works for the many" is just another way of saying "bring others down to your level." Nope. Rising tides raise all boats my dude!

You would make more money working an actual side job and converting all of the fiat you receive from said job to BTC. I looked into this four years ago and the numbers were bad then. This was four years ago. You will always run in the negative unless you are yuuuuuge and thus your economies of scale are high. Just set up a bi-weekly buy from Coinbase.

She is not the problem. She is a keeper. Her money is her money because that's the way WE decided to split the bills where she receives a monthly allowance. Not that it is any of your business. 


I said something similar earlier to her today about how she is not looking at the millions of people that have tried and failed. She is ignorant of economics and entrepreneurship. But she supports me whenever I take any risks. I think she just wants me to do this because she thinks I'm scared because of the risks involved. Which is true; I'm "scared" of the risks but only because the rewards do not outweigh them. Bitcoin would have to have another rally of 1000%. Which given Bitcoin, possible, especially taking into account the bond bubble.

Avoid getting your coin hacked? 
And after all of that not sell at $32...$100, $1000, etc?

Nope. I am saying I don't see the difference. You're saying "KitKats are bad but Snickers are okay." It all stems from one thing, the monopoly on the use of violence. Government, kings, monarchs, all have this in common. They take from people through force what was never theirs. And people say "democratically elected" people are given those rights, but you did not have any of those rights to give in the first place. So how am I to magically give you the ability to fly if "we" just all vote on it. Trees do not gain abilities because you call the group of trees a forest. And humans are not given the "right" to take from their neighbor just because a mob of them said it was okay to do so.

Try to stay on topic. We are talking about roads here which are being paid for via gasoline taxes in America. 
You can't fool me dude. I've been down this government paid theorictically road thousand times before. You know those people that say "If evolution is true then why are there still monkeys!?" thinking that is the end-all-be-all gotcha question? That's how these sound to me.  So in the order you put them: 
Donations like they're already happeneing. 
Sewer/water company 
Water pipes are paid for by plumbers and home owners, like they already are. 
Gas lines paid by gas companies like they already are. 
Telecoms? I'm suuure you're on the Comcast sucks circlejerk right? Why do you think that is? 
Infrastructure... we are already talking about roads. It is just as easy to talk about bridges. 
Private security is already being paid for over police. Police are minutes away. Private security stays in your building. 
Fire. Already have volunteer firefighters in smaller cities. Larger cities would have it being part of your home insurance. A bank would not loan on a house without fire protection. 
Paramedics? I imagine an Uber like system. Except with RNs and/or LPNs. 
You'd guess right, but the ad hominem isn't needed. And meh, I know I'm wrong about what it will actually look like. Because if I told you 100 years ago that we should free the slaves, you'd say "Well who would pick the cotton!?" And I'd tell you, "These huuuge metal contraptions that pick better than 1000 slaves and runs on dino-juice to power it! It will be so awesome only a few people will be able to fed thousands!"
And you'd rightfully object that's not an answer. So again, I don't know the future. I don't know what millions of people coming together trying to solve complex issues will come up with. Watch an episode of Shark Tank and imagine that competition for your water supply, medical services, fiber cables...everything. 
That's what I want. And we don't need the middlemen (governments) to get there.

In the end I'm not a good messenger. I'm working on it though. But it is something I have studied for over a decade with economics and phraxeology.

And the economics that deflation favors growth is preferred as well. You didn't make a point with that comment. Savings shifts from consumption into long term investments. The long term investments increase the range of the production possibilities frontier and the economies grows faster than had it was previously under the normal rate of consumption before savings. It's pretty spectacular to watch once you understand it all. Took me three years of graduate study to really get it. I just wish I was as good at explaining it as the professors.

Progress takes time. We once lived in a world ruled by kings. I hope one day we will see governments the same way. Also governments only know how to do one thing: grow. That's why we had the smallest government (US government circa 1776) eventually turn into the largest (outspends the next top 5 countries combined on military. That's crazy btw!)

Yea I wish I could! I honestly don't believe that the "free-marketers" are going to win the debate. It's hard when the solution is not easily seen or is put in the faith of others. "No one will go without healthcare" is a lot easier sell than "Healthcare will be affordable and accessible to all"

Will phones stop selling? Computers? I can wait and get a better computer 3 months from now. 
Businesses are going to have to adjust as well. They will make longer lasting products to compete with prices that go down. And remember this is how things *used to be.* Prices would go *down* not up. They still do, but your purchasing power goes down quicker than prices.

Well capitalism has taken the most people out of poverty throughout the years. And communism is immoral from the start as it starts on the premise of theft. 
I don't care that rich get richer. That's just how it is. I can go buy some real estate but the rich people are making millions while I am making nothing in comparison. It's just a bigger game. But because they get rich people have a place to live for 50 years. The building is well maintained. That's capitalism. I am just fine with the rich.

It depends on how you define "inflation" which a lot of people here will say is merely increasing the total supply of money. Currently, Bitcoin experiences inflation of 1,800 BTC per day since they are created via the block reward. In June of 2020, this will halve to 900 BTC per day. Over 80% of all Bitcoin have been mined as well. The total supply of Bitcoin will NEVER increase beyond 21 million and this is by design to simulate scarcity. Rather than increasing the money supply like the USD does via the Fed, Bitcoin allows units to be divisible up to a million times. Eventually, all the Bitcoin, or close to it will be mined and no more will be created via inflation. Because we all know this, the increase in money supply could be argued is priced in. 
Others think of inflation as just the increasing in price in terms of USD, which I don't agree with. 
[Rothbard has defined it as "the process of issuing money beyond any increase in the stock of specie."]( which I think is the most precise definition. 
Does that help? My fiancee says I'm terrible at explaining things. Lol

Man I can't help but think that you are being a bit hypocritical. You and I live in the top 1% of the world, even without ever reaching the "riches" we have acquired (which congrats btw!). We could be middle to lower class and even then still be far better off than 99% of the world. Why does your socialism stop at your imaginary border? I am sure that the lower 50% would look at the life of an average American or European and would love some of those "riches" for themselves for their "lack of support" too. 
["People will die!"]( I always think of this rap whenever this argument comes up so it makes me laugh. Lol. And it is BECAUSE people will die without healthcare that I want a market!! You're not getting it I feel. ONLY and I mean ONLY the market provides a system that creates low costs and effects the most people positively. It creates a system whereby people are incentivised to create. Markets and competition causes prices to decrease over time. Just look at the Lasik market to understand what I mean.   
I am not saying what we have in the US is right. I'd probably even agree that your system is currently better. But that's because our big pharma and insurance companies here are bribing our politicians to ensure that we get single-payer like what you have but we are forced to buy from these businesses. So we haven't had a market for healthcare for a loooong time. It's stupid right now. I'd pick your system over what we have now but that is not an endorsement of your system. 
But hey... We don't have to do the same thing you know? I'd love to actually settle this debate. Let's open the markets in healthcare in America for 20 years and you guys keep on doing what you're doing. Let's see who has it better! Haha! I'd wager my life that our market's would be better. And if not, well then we can always go back to your guys' way of doing things pretty easily. :)

I sub to both and hodl both and I don't agree with your evaluation. BCH is lying a lot and it's a huge issue I have with the subreddit. It seems it's slowly trying to turn itself around and focus on the tech, but for a year after the fork it was a toxic shitshow over there. The vitriol over "Bitcoin Core" as they like to call Bitcoin was undeniable. Just by mere calling Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core" is toxic. And then there is Roger who is not at all the best person to be a spokeperson for anything other than oil of the snake variety. 
All that being said, I have not sold my BCH. Why? Because I understand its importance. I understand what the tech is trying to do and why it's a great alternative should LN fail or Bitcoin just fail to be accepted. I don't care what some lunatics on reddit have to say about it. Reddit is a mess. It'd be like going to and deciding who to vote for or Again, in either case, you'd be uninformed.

Which causes the interest rate to decrease to incentivize people to borrow or invest. Entire markets do not overbuy and thus have huge booms and bust cycles. Ya'll act like people don't need bread and won't eat because "hoarding money" will always be what happens. If that were true iPhones or computers, TVs, wouldn't t be profitable since you could just wait to get a better one for the same price (all this in spite of inflation too).

Where do you think that money is going to be stored? Under your mattress? If it's a couple hundred sure, you're right but it isn't going to change the economy because $100 was taken out. 
Instead a bank will hold it and can use the money for long-term investments. As savings increase, consumption and short-term investments decrease and investments are made. The PPF is expanded and the economy grows **at a greater rate that it would have previously** due to the investment.

Me either. Really I have never thought about as "investing" but more along the lines of supporting something I agree with. Wanting to have a secure and hard asset currency (like gold for example) is something I've looked for. It took me awhile but eventually I agreed that Bitcoin had value via the blockchain. Thanks to its limited supply and the value the blockchain provides, more demand will come and thus the price will go up. That's been my thoughts since 2013 but again, I haven't bought to make more money but to have more Bitcoin.

If you bought real estate at the peak of the 2007 bubble and it was a good deal at the time you would be up now. 
I think Bitcoin is the same. I felt the same way at $1100 went that was the ATH and then it crashed to $200. You gotta think why did you purchase? Was it the hype? Or was it the fundamentals of Bitcoin being a product that solved the Byzantine Problem, transfers wealth without anyone's permission, and has survived multiple huge attacks on it again and again? 
Bitcoin is better than ever. Anything less than $100,000 is cheap. You may laugh at this but I laughed at those that said "getting me some cheap coins" when talking about $1,000 coins.

You don't have a lot of money and you're panicking about $150? Maybe you shouldn't be gambling with money you can't afford to lose. 
Just do a bi-weekly buy of $10-$50. 
$150 is just over 5% of the value right now. BTC could crash back down to 1100 tomorrow. We don't know. 
Trust me when I say we know how you feel. It was very hard to buy at 1050 and then watch it plummet to 400 and stay there for 2 YEARS. 
It doesn't matter though. The fundamentals are still there. Decentralized, trustless, and unable to manipulate like the Fed does with your $avings.  
Welcome to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:36:44
This is why I plan on not buying in until like $200 or more if I ever get thrown back in time. I don't want to accidentally mine a bunch of coins, hold them, and then cause not enough people to adopt and thus it never takes off.

Don't listen to what people on the Internet tell you. Do what you think is right. 
You have 10k saved up somehow? That's pretty cool. Good for you. 
Imagine, how do you feel if Bitcoin crashed to $400 in five years? Be honest with yourself! 
We all know how you feel if it goes to $10,000+ 
If you can stomach losing the 10k and realize how HUGE of a gamble it is go for it. You're very young. You still have plenty of time to make it back. The younger you are and the less obligations you have the more risky you can invest. 
Just be sure to have a plan and stick to it. Don't panic sell if you are faithful in your bet.

Agreed. But so were computers and the Internet at some point. You had to have a phone book of ip addresses that you typed in. You needed to invest in hardware like a modem. It was slow. There wasn't really any point other than a few niche things.

I felt that way two years ago. I bought at near 1100. And then it crashed all the way down to 400 and stayed there for two years.

20-30% = Mainstream recognition 
40-50% = Small country like Zimbabwe or Venezuela back their currency with Bitcoin 
50 - 60% = African countries start backing
60 - 70% = Japan adopts currency 
70 - 80% = China starts trading in Bitcoin 
80 - 90% = US allows taxes to be paid via BTC 
90 - 100% = Federal Reserve abolished

Maybe, but then again maybe not. If it becomes adopted Satoshi would be the richest person in the world, overnight basically. And it would be hurtful to a lot of governments. He could been discredited and painted as a "terrawist" and thus have his life in danger. 
I think it is more likely that he doesn't want his name dragged in the mud as a means to discredit Bitcoin, which you know the media would do. And also protecting his life. 
I just don't think that this would be something government would do. As someone else stated, it wouldn't be anywhere near their best interests since banking could no longer create money out of thin air. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:19:03


No Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin. It would akin to saying Microsoft Windows is Microsoft. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:44:53
What do you think would happen to the price if someone was trying to buy all the Bitcoin. And lets say that you are correct and someone is able to buy let's say something like 99% of the supply of available Bitcoin. 
It doesn't matter still because it is divisible down to 8 decimal places right now. If there is a need for it, additional decimal places can be added with consensus of the network. This is why some refer to "infinite" divisibility, because we can select the level that we need as time goes on. Thus instead of saying Bitcoin is curenntly $100,000,000/BTC we'd say one Satoshi costs $1. Or $1/0.00000001BTC. And we can just keep moving the decimal point. So. again, even in the end someone is able to "hold a monopoly" Bitcoin still works.

I can't take out 100,000 for Bitcoin that's why. My renters pay for my properties and I can use them as leverage for bigger properties. Meanwhile I still have Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a huuuuge risk. Real estate is waaaay less risky than it. I'm in both for the long haul since I'm only 29. 30 years from now I'll have plenty of real estate to retire if Bitcoin doesn't take off. If it does, I have plenty of Bitcoin to retire early.

If you thought this to be true, would you buy *now* in order to sell the high or close to the high as possible to then rebuy when it pops? 
Well, you and me both. So yes, my behaviors have changed because I know it is halving in the future. If it were a random event that may or may not happen, that would also effect my purchasing behavior. 
So just because an event hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't effect the price. Think of it as a hurricane coming in the future. that we 100% know is coming on X months. Are you suggesting that home insurance for the area within the hurricane's range would *not* be effected since the hurricane has yet to happen?

You are confusing today's prices (with the halving costed in) with the future prices (when the supply of goods decrease by half). If demand stays the same of course the price will rise. What I am saying is that the price *today* already reflects that a halving is in the near future. I am not talking about supply. You're actually over-thinking this. :)
All and all though we don't know if more demand will happen near or at the pricing. Because of unforeseen events. Perhaps Greatcoin will become a thing and no one will want Bitcoin. Or a million other things. These are unknowns. We known the halving so the price today has it reflected.

He is not a saint but saying he has not done anything positive is empirically false.

For small amounts if you're in the US, Coinbase. For larger amounts, Trezzor. They have excellent customer service and a trustless system so even if it is stolen you still have a PIN to protect it that can't be brute forced.

Is someone "in charge" of making the ham sandwich I packed for lunch today? Think of all the people that were needed just to make that. I needed a tomato. To make a tomato I needed farmers to grow it. I needed someone to pick it. I needed the farmer to sell to a distributor to ship the tomato from across the country to near where I live. I then need a market like County Market to buy the tomato from and I missed a bunch of steps in between that I'm not even aware of! That's just for a tomato. :)  
I needed meat, mayo, bread, mustard, and a plastic bag. Each one of these things is a process. We don't need "overseers" to make all of this come together easily. But if the government were in charge of ham sandwiches you'd be here saying "So you want to live in a world without bread!?"

Interesting mentality. I think of the money I have spent purchasing my coins as gone, but I am more doing it as an investment/gamble. 
I don't see how governments like the US will allow this thing to exist and will try to regulate or make illegal the use of bitcoins. Thus no one in US adopts. Maybe China and other countries adopt though so there's still those markets that will accept them, but still very very risky.

I think that's where our conversation was different because we didn't have the same assumptions. Think of poor people in the world. And income inequality will likely level out to 80-20 where 80% of the wealth is held by 20% of the population. That means that 80% of the people only have access to 20% of the 21M BTC available, assuming one day Satoshi's stash is moved and all the lost coin are somehow found as well.  That's a 4.2M supply.

Just playing Devil's Advocate here. Maybe it's not age appropriate due to the costs of mining. In your paper you are discussing making money through mining but you need $5,000 in order to do this.

Hey man! Just some friendly hope from a stranger. Keep at it. I did the same thing working for one of the "evil banks" that received a bailout. It was a job though, paid my bills, and looked fucking great on the resume. I was one of the 12 selected out of hundreds of candidates that applied in the half hour the job was available to be applied for. I hated every minute of my job there. But now I am in the field I want to be in and I could NOT have landed this job without THAT job on the resume. 
Keep your head up. Stay happy. You're still supporting your family. You'll find what you're looking for if you keep trying. I wish you the best of luck.

But when you are using the money to purchase a domain anyway, how does this clog the blockchain? The money was being transferred in order to pay for the domain. 
Thank you for replying btw. Not trying to be contrarian. :)

Omg... This is too great!! Hahahahaha.

I see. Which I agree. Yes I am losing money. Put if I can help in a little way, then I'm happy to help out. If only small. And one day those not even a full bitcoin numbers will be able to buy me a nice cookie that I can eat and say that I helped us get there.

I usually keep my computer running during the day. This is just an easy way for me to get some bitcoins while not really doing anything. 
I'm still buying next paycheck don't worry :) Still, I wish the prices weren't skyrocketing to the moon already. I was hoping to be able to buy again before then :D

Thank you for this comment. Anytime someone criticizes or objects to Bitcoin it is met with downvotes or "lolz he's stoopid"  
He has legitimate concerns and they need to be addressed. If someone like Peter cannot get on board, then what hope do we have of getting the Keynesians on board?

I really like your comment a lot. Thanks for taking the time to write it.

Forget uBTC or Satoshi. I'm spending Bitchcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:06:17
I see. I've never had any huge positions before (still don't) so I don't understand how one person can manipulate a market like that. All very interesting. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:20:57
Thanks! This helped out a lot :D

Was it because of what someone said on CSPAN? I know Fed hearings can have that effect. 
Someone sell a big amount? 
Not trying to be a day-trader. Just trying to figure out more about market volatility. 
Also yes. Welcome to bitcoin. :D

What I think to myself is when I was thinking I would buy a bitcoin a month was 2 months ago. If I did that I would have not bought in as big as I did because I would have hesitated. I would think, "No. I am buying only 1 a month." 
Now, next paycheck I am getting more. 
I suppose it's good if, in the end, it's...TO THE MOON! Haha. Couldn't resist.

I bought some around there on Black Friday. When I woke up today I was a little sad. Still, I am not tooooo mad about it since it was only a slight move. That's the game. But I know I'm not selling.

Like a fat guy telling me how to lose weight.

The best time to plant a tree was yesterday. The best time to buy a bitcoin...

Stefan is always great. Clear and great points. I wonder how many he has since he's been on the Bitcoin train for some time now. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:22:20
Thanks! I still need to do some more research to figure out how I want to store them. But yeah, I'll be transferring them away when they show up on the website next week.
