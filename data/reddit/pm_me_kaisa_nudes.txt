Free speech that harms people with absurd conspiracy theories? It’s not healthy for our society. 
Also, free speech protects you from government censorship, not businesses.

It’s really not that hard to treat everyone like their a human. We are all human, but the disdain for another human never made sense to me. Just let the other humans do what they want; what they do that you don’t agree with. If it’s not hurting you or significantly harming your life, why care?Why would it matter what someone’s sexual orientation is? They are just humans doing what makes them happy; like how we are all humans doing what makes us happy.

Sounds like a good point for repealing Citizens United.

I’m in no way a bot. I’m a fucking human.

That’s the most uneducated, short-sided response I’ve ever experienced come from another human. The man has no evidence for his claims. “Evidence” that he cooks up in his brain isn’t evidence. That’s his frantic imagination saying whatever he can to tell a false narrative and convince people he knows what he is talking about. A large portion of America aren’t very smart. Think of your average American’s intelligence, and then think that half of America is less intelligent than they are. A gullible segment of America would fall for this man’s bs just because that’s the reality that makes them “feel good”. It’s not healthy for the human mind to construct views of reality that do not exist. It leads to many of the issues we have in American society today, the ones that desperately need to be mended.

He may be experiencing some cognitive dissonance from that statement.

How is it politics? Companies do things for a reason and the only reason is their bottom dollar. If they think one customer gives them bad publicity leading to lower sales, they will not deal with that customer. The bad publicity from having AJ as a user probably lead them to make the decision.

And then maybe other nutjobs that spout alt-ring conspiracy theories?

Society wields the power to ignore it or boycott it. In turn, the people the conspiracy theories are being held up by collapse, in fear that it will hurt their bottom dollar from customer boycotts. 
Banning, doesn’t require a government, it can be done by the people through collective action and majority rule.

We do as a society. A society that follows science-based evidence with verifiable facts. You must be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that what you are claiming is true. That’s how our world works. Throwing out conspiracy theories that don’t hold water have no role in our society. Sure, they can stand on a street corner and shout their bs to the world, but the internet can’t be a place for this. We have too many gullible Americans and the harmful rhetoric used by AJ isn’t healthy for their brains. It could very easily lead to violence and mistrust that wouldn’t have existed without his outlandish theories.

I’m not a troll bot. I’m being serious, why allow the spread of conspiracy theories? They in no way benefit civil society.
