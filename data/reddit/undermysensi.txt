I'm having trouble parsing your post.  I hope you're not suggesting that in a libertarian world, people would have more freedom and a more even distribution of wealth.  Quite the opposite would happen.  Especially if that libertarian world includes corporations defined as persons.

In other words, there's never been a free market in history because of ... human nature?  What the fuck makes you think it's possible then?  Oh, I get it:  you intend to bring it about by force, i.e. the "violence" you claim to be so against.  
It will take actual violence, too, because nobody's gonna like a few rich motherfuckers privatising everything and telling people to get off "their" land and die.

I never undertook to save bitcoin.  I'm just outlining a potential problem.  Your solution is that everyone should open their own exchange?  You must be a special kind of moron.

What if the independent certification authority becomes corrupt, kinda like the ratings agencies that failed to warn us about Bear Stearns, AIG, etc...
That's just one problem.  Nobody is required to apply to these independent certification "authorities."  If foregoing that results in a better bottom line for consumers, a substantial portion of the bitcoin market will not require that services have certification.  Certainly, those users will be undertaking risk, but because it is an economy after all, their risk taking potentially loops the rest of us into a risk as well.

Pal, the reason why you and I will never see eye to eye on these issues isn't because of the quality of cement or gravel.  It's because you'd like to see a class based society where poor people can't even travel on the fucking roads.  I think that's unacceptable.  
I'd rather have shitty roads that anyone can ride on, than none at all.  
Now, as far as your voluntaryism goes, again, I have no problem with that.  I don't want any of your money.  I also don't want you walking around on my city streets, drinking water that's passed through utilities, using any electricity you don't generate yourself, or any of the innumerable other services and benefits provided by government.
Now, let's see how far you can stretch your imagination.  Insults won't get you anywhere, so why don't you please address the merits of my argument instead of name calling and making stupid assumptions.

You don't have to use it, but if enough people do, and a significant portion of the bitcoin economy falters, e.g. mt. gox, the rest of us will still suffer negative repercussions.

All of the paraplegics could also crawl on top of each other to form a mountain that reaches high enough to grab a banana.  Doesn't make it feasible or right.

Yes.  It's an apt comparison, because poor people in today's society may as well be disabled.

Pay for the service you bum!  How are we ever going to realize the libertarian dream if we have moochers like you?

No.  You'd have huge swaths of land owned by absentee landlords that will not allow any roads to be built, or, alternatively, will build nice roads accessible to only a minority of people who are able to pay the toll.  Fuck that.
Here's a task for you:  Where in the world do we have a "free market" of the type that you envision, so that we can put your theory to the test?  When in history has there ever been a "free market" of the type that you envision?  If not, why not?

I thought we were talking about poor people.  Show me where a bunch of poor people pooled money together on kickstarter.  Also, kickstart is a bad example for the point you're trying to make.  See, Oculus.

It might not be needed, but it sure helps.  Is that even arguable?

What's the point of even complaining about the stupid things that herds do?  Shouldn't systems be designed around or just address stupid herd instincts?

Since when were libertarians against corporations?  Without giant corporations and economies of scale, how would wonderful things like ipads be researched and created?
The more central problem with libertarianism is the idea that wealth should pass through inheritance, and that access to everything in life (perhaps even access to life) should be controlled by how much wealth your family has.  It's absurd.
Within a couple of generations of the libertarians having their way, we'd see a massive return to widespread illiteracy, poverty, and a few smirking feudal lords at the top controlling access to everything.

There's a lot of invective in your post, but very little analysis.  I only mentioned roads, schools, libraries, etc..., because I don't have to agree with EVERYTHING that the government does with our tax money, to argue that there isn't some public benefit for some governmental functions.  In other words, you're relying on a logical fallacy for your argument.
That "special group" you're referring to, when we're talking about roads, schools, and utilities, is all of us.  Everyone.  Everyone benefits from some central planning once in a while.  Why is that so hard for you to admit?
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:33:34
That's not just a bit extreme; that's off the fucking reservation.  Government pools public resources, hopefully for the common good by building roads, subsidizing utilities, etc...
What's so wrong about ordinary common folk, who can't pay for a road, to pitch in so that they and their children can have a public road that anyone can travel on?  How is that rape, of all things?
Here's an idea that I'd be okay with.  Rich people can opt out of paying taxes if they promise they won't use any public service or benefit, and will pay a stiff penalty if caught doing so.  Don't pay taxes.  Don't use the roads.  Have a problem that you'd like to take to Court?  Fuck you, deal with it yourself.

What are you talking about?? That's terrible news!  We don't need government intervention!  Let the invisible hand of the market do its work.  How will we ever realize the great libertarian dream if people start bleating for government intervention after every private transaction gone wrong?

I'm trying to give you information about a potential problem, and you call that bitching and moaning?  You've only again confirmed that you are a complete moron.  If you're not capable of rational discussion, maybe you should leave that to your betters.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 01:02:21
You might find it liberating to rid yourself of dishonesty.  Just admit that you started down the wrong trail and found a dead end.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:39:42
Not to mention schools, libraries, and parks.  We should just let the rich people own everything, make up all the rules, and pass all their wealth and means of production to their heirs and assigns.  The rest of us can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.

Closing the laptop lid, provided the user has properly configured their computer to shutdown or hibernate the machine, might work to re-encrypt the drive. However, law enforcement do have other techniques to pull the key even off of a machine that has been shut down.

OK, he wasn't the operator, but the site went down after he was raided? As far as I can tell this guy wants money because he was affiliated with a btc casino. That's all it takes?
@_date: 2015-04-29 23:06:51
It will be interesting to see if this guy returns to the USA to clear his name once sufficient btc have been donated. If he was "simply the face" of swc, and not operating anything, it should be a short trial amirite?
I bet he does not though. I bet he remains on the lam and pockets the "legal defense" donations.
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:56:30
How does an online casino operator have so little money that he must beg for it here? Why should I be sympathetic? Because his casino happened to use btc instead of fiat?  I'm not donating a penny.
