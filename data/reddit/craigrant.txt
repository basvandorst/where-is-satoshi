this week I converted my 50% of my BTC to ether and dash, and I had no interest in any other coin until seeing all the negativity in BTC for the past 10 days
@_date: 2016-01-20 04:34:21
Is started using bitcoin 4 weeks ago, before this it did not exist, anything about it existing before that is just a story, and nothing else, now that's how crazy I am
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:05:34
relax, it's no big deal according to this expert
@_date: 2016-01-31 03:31:06
every time he hears the word bitcoin, he imagines his funeral

Bitcoin Pot Of Gold @ 
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:39:33
to ask my self what am I doing to drive the value of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:16:51
yes, never thought of that, and those are important... see I don't know it all, I only know what I hear about
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:55:19
yes, impatience is a bankers mentality, that's how they get people to pay higher interest rates
@_date: 2016-01-30 21:32:33
Enjoy the Pot Of Gold @

my personal experience is amazing
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:02:23
beautiful :)
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:02:28
yes, Trace seems to have very good hold on what is really going on from a technical standpoint, while the opposing views are more political in nature. Politics and technology are two separate worlds
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:50:15
I disagree with the notion that the banks and the government want bitcoin to fail. From all the information I have personally gathered from human beings in the banking and government system, the majority of them want bitcoin to succeed. The only place I see the idea of banks and the government being against bitcoin is online in social media posts, by fearful individuals who get caught up in the media trying to make a buck by spreading fear. The media is not a reflection of the banking or the government system.
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:07:51
people who work in the banking system are very aware that the system is broken and outdated, and they see bitcoin as the savior, they are ready and willing to welcome it open hearts. I guess allot of you guys online get a kick out of "the war" you all imagine to be going in between bitcoin and banks/gov... but it's all an imaginary fantasy. There is no conspiracy, yes there are single individuals here and there who express outlandish opinions, and they will all fade away in time. There is no fight to fight, everything is all right, Bitcoin will be in a state of transition for a while.. enjoy the ride, I know I am.

5 weeks ago I started converting US dollars to Bitcoin

A strong foundation that gets stronger and unite under pressure
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:09:56
I don't think anyone can write a more "damaging" article than that, and in 2 days from now when Bitcoin is still flourishing without any interruption, the holders of Bitcoin will still have huge smiles on their faces.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:21:39
bitcoin disrupts the system, so the system puts 20 guys in a room to post disruptive political views on reddit and other places where bitcoiners hang out trying to peacefully get along with their business
@_date: 2016-01-20 05:18:40

The Bitcoin Pot Of Gold @ 
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:44:31
they all know the system is broken and outdated, and they will all sit on the sidelines and watch Bitcoin make it's transition for the next few years to replace the broken system, all this crying and screaming about a war is just finger tips tapping on keyboards, and nothing else. The three old guys in this video is a clear example of them just waiting for bitcoin to do what it will do, it's just a matter of time
@_date: 2016-01-29 20:55:12
If I buy coins now that would not be smart, the smart move would be to buy Bitcoin when it passes $500
@_date: 2016-01-20 04:59:10
there is beauty in simplicity
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:36:54
for sure, life is nothing but a hustle from my point of view
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:04:00
I personally think that any wallet address that sends less than $1 needs to wait at the back of the line, for days if neccessary
@_date: 2016-01-24 00:35:57
Everybody loves Bitcoin, but Bitcoin don't love nobody

I created a video showing how I use paypal to buy bitcoin using circle.com @ 
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:13:24
I respect them for what they do, as I am a consumer too
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:37:39
my style is impetuous :)
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:14:02
very true, $10 is the max I think, and $5 is the ideal
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:02:37
yes, it's perfectly ok on YouTube for me to watch a 50 minute video and extract 5 quality minutes from it that I feel is worth everyone else to hear, considering what's going on in the bitcoin space right now
@_date: 2016-01-23 23:10:52

there is already an overload of skepticism going on on my computer screen, so I choose to remain on the extreme other side of that spectrum
@_date: 2016-01-20 05:49:21
a great idea that created itself, for Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-14 01:26:56
After 3 weeks learning and dealing with bitcoin, this is the question that's on my mind
@_date: 2016-01-20 05:24:42
maybe will just setup and start being bitcoin miners, they have the resources, perhaps to centralize the mining to themselves, this would be good for bitcoin... right

I don't know about "any of us", but I know I have the right to judge anything I want, and so I do judge, and I'm delighted to share my opinions after I judge. I'm a self aware person, it's not about we, us, they, or them, my life choices are all about me :)

Bitcoin Pot Of Gold @ 
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:12:02
I'm personally involved in managing hundreds of transactions on the blockchain from tips and donations, and less than 2% of them are less than $1, so 60% of the block being hoarded up by them seems very suspect to me. It's a good way to attack in my opinion. Or maybe it's all those alt-coin transactions, and I don't care for those either.
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:38:25
I was getting tips before I created the pot, so the pot is my way of giving tips back, check out the public ledger to see the tips going back 
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:56:28
$600 here we come
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:59:25
yes, those words are perfect, I have already been a millionaire, so it's naturally the next step forward

@_date: 2016-01-15 22:58:30
it works great
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:34:36
yes, it's equally divided, the point is to have fun tipping and receiving tips, the pot is week 3 and everybody involved is enjoying it, if you don't see "the point" then don't participate. My 10% comes off the bottom, not the top :)
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:14:49
I don't think there are any non-believers left, to even believe in words from an article like this verses the value of bitcoin sustaining itself would not be the type of person to get involved with bitcoin in the first place
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:13:04
FUN = FLY UP NOW :)

@_date: 2016-01-20 15:31:44
US tanks represent technology, and technology is what makes bitcoin strong. Comics use words to entertain and stir emotions, and that's all the R3 can do right now, so you have it backwards
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:53:02
I think the authority goes to who is willing to pay miners for it, as the miners are doing most of the hard work

I spend bitcoin every week on overstock.com and make videos showing  myself doing that, and I also spend bitcoin everyday by sending tips to other youtube video creators. I even have a web site dedicated to sharing tips between creators of content and those who tip the creators, I call it the Bitcoin Pot Of Gold, and it creates over 50 bitcoin transactions per week all documented by pubic ledger. The site is at  if you would like to participate. So yes I do spend allot of bitcoin, but I have a nice stash of  bitcoin that I intend to hold and may never spend for the rest of my life
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:28:55
a wild ride
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:04:13
and very encouraging, videos like that dont come by planning, they just flow from the trees when I turn on the camera, guess I need to do more of that, just let nature speak for itself
@_date: 2016-06-02 13:52:15
Gemini is much safer yes, I have some bitcoin with Gemini, and I can't stop myself from trading them for ether, the coinbase vault does that
@_date: 2016-06-02 13:49:30
I am not good at keeping physical objects safe, and I dont trust them more than the cloud

enjoyed reading this post and all the comments, bitgold is just lie a bank, or worse
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:58:12
I don't spend money with cards that much, less than $100 per week, mostly at the grocery store, so I can't think of any features that would  enhance that. I am happy to have the card just in case I need to spend Bitcoin at the store.
