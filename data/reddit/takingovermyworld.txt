Yea that's kind of what I've been thinkin. I've been watching it since it was around 1900 earlier this year and the feeling of not having invested then to now is eating at me and for some reason I still have cold feet about it. What is the safest way to buy in and ensure my funds to be secure and not potentially hacked/stolen?

Cool.  Better late than never I guess. I appreciate the input

Well I'm quite alright with living with basically nothing. I guess I'm just trying to see why it is valuable for someone who has so little. Obviously people who can buy large amounts will see big returns but how long will it take for a small investment to see big returns? I appreciate the reply btw

So bitcoin is forcing you to become a dishonest person?

It definitely makes sense why people are skeptical about it. It's a very new idea and quite frankly it doesn't make much sense how value can be created from nothing. Although that's how our paper money has been for almost 100 years. It was started as a way to decentralize money and take the government out of our pockets. But given there is a finite amount of bitcoin, if fiat money were to lose all its value and bitcoin became the fundamental currency of the world then would money still not be concentrated, even more so, to a specific few. Then what? Those who missed out are just fucked? And if there are multiple cryptocurrencys then how will they be valued against each other in the market? It's hard not to be skeptical about the long term of bitcoin. But it's obvious that there is value because so many have proven this. I am not the most tech savvy person. Or even the smartest person which I humbly admit. Maybe I'm missing something. Hopefully someone can help sell the idea to me a little more.
