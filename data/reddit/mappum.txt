I dropped ~10 BTC on alpaca socks in early 2011, and now I can only find one of them :/

"Antiprism" would sound way cooler, and it's a [real word](

Just FYI, 512 bit hashes are probably larger than you need. It is safe to truncate SHA2-512 output to 256 bits (this is actually common since SHA2-512 is faster than SHA2-256 on many modern processors), otherwise SHA2-256 should be fine.
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:56:09
It seems you are using SHA1 hashes to verify files, but SHA1 is broken (use something like SHA2).
Also, what is the point of using Bitcoin's elliptic curve cryptography? You would probably be better off using RSA, at the expense of larger keys (but would save a lot of CPU since verifications are much faster).

What language/libraries did you use to build your application?

ShapeShift still requires trust, it just shortens the period of time where the coins are vulnerable.

I made something like this as well: 
It uses [Webcoin]( so everything happens inside your browser (you're running a whole SPV client which connects to full nodes to get its data, rather than a centralized API).

They make it sound like the Occupiers love Bitcoin, but to me it seems like the awareness is pretty low.

It's PHP, anything can happen.

I believe Google graphs supports AJAX updates to graphs, so you could make it automatically plot it straight from the Mt. Gox feed.
Do you mean you actually want to keep updating and saving the data from that feed? You can parse the data with PHP's json_decode function and put it in a MySQL database.
@_date: 2011-10-08 08:52:03
Awesome, thanks. That's pretty much what I was hoping for.

I agree, using LaTeX to create a whitepaper doesn't give it merit. But have you seen who the authors are? Blockstream is all the best minds in cryptocurrency, and the team is mostly the Bitcoin Core developers.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:31:14
Well technically sidechains use Bitcoin as their value token, but they are still a separate technology to create support for. And different sidechains can vary quite a lot in nature.

If an attacker mutated your transaction, your refund would then be invalidated, and your coins would be stuck (until the attacker lets you take them back, e.g. after you pay the ransom).
However, in reality malleability is at least hard to pull off (especially as of Bitcoin Core 0.10), so while this is a weakness, it shouldn't be prohibitively critical. And OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY completely fixes the issue. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:24:37
I think you are misunderstanding how the security deposit fits into the protocol. Failing to go through with a trade cannot cause funds to be stolen, it can only not make the trade happen in the first place. Either both coins are swapped, or neither. (Hence why the protocol is called *atomic* cross-chain swaps).

About tree fitty. Thanks!

See 


This is correct. But while it is not "fully decentralized", it is "fully trustless" as no trust is placed in that central order book server. This model is in some ways similar to BitTorrent, where search/tracking is centralized (ThePirateBay), but the actual business of transferring files is fully peer-to-peer.
Similar to BitTorrent, there would never be reliance on one single centralized service, even if ThePirateBay goes down there are many other services available.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:28:08
Those regulated assets could slip through the cracks of regulation if some party anonymously created a different order book service, just like how ThePirateBay can help distribute copyrighted content.

Counterparty transactions are actually *not* secured by the mining power of the Bitcoin blockchain. Sure, Counterparty transactions are on the blockchain, but from the miners' point of view they are just data, and no verification is being done to ensure they are valid.
I could create a Counterparty transaction sending myself $100,000,000 and it would get accepted onto the Bitcoin blockchain (so it would be up to Counterparty wallets to make sure it is valid). Being notarized on the blockchain isn't really doing much to "secure" the transactions. This is why metacoins aren't a particularly good model for cryptocurrency.

Hey, author of Mercury here. While you are correct that this can't directly handle fiat, there are ways to back crypto-assets with fiat, for example colored coins or tokens issued on sidechains (e.g. CoinbaseUSD-coins). Of course, that means you are trusting a "gateway" or "issuer" to honor your USDcoins. There is no way to make fiat fully decentralized, simply because fiat is not cryptocurrency.
However, an ecosystem with many institutions issuing fiat coins is a good way to bootstrap the cryptocurrency economy (in a similar way to how dial-up used existing telco infrastructure to bootstrap the consumer internet).
Also, this model isn't as trust-dependent as it seems. Since all accounting of USDCoins (or GoldCoins, GoogleShareCoins, etc.) happens on the blockchain instead of a centralized database, the issuer can be held responsible for honoring the coins, and is publicly auditable. This means no shady secret Mt. Gox stuff would be possible.

Wow, very interesting. I'll definitely follow that for integrating Ethereum. What's the status of that project, is it already working reliably?

He's been hanging out in IRC grokking Bitcoin for the last few months, so I would now say he understands it at an expert level.

Hey, I'm the author of Mercury. I just want to point out that Mercury is still really early. It should be functional enough to test out with a small amount of money, but I'm still looking to get the code audited and to fix some general bugs. (It would be great if anyone can file some issues on the [github repo]( if you find anything, I'll even pay bounties for big security vulnerabilities with the atomic cross-chain swap code).
If you want to follow the progress of Mercury, you can check out the site at  Thanks for your interest!

What "scams" are you imagining?
It's pretty easy to ensure the order book is legit, for instance making every order signed by the key that holds the funds. This way, the client can verify orders are actually coming from someone holding coins (in a way that can't be faked by the service or traders).
Even though a centralized server is a component of the trading system, it is entirely optional to use and traders can instead match orders themselves on IRC or forums for instance, or alternate orderbook servers.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:02:17
Hm, good point. It does certainly seem like he tried to make people think that was the signature though.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:34:15
I actually hadn't thought about that, but that would work well (the deposit could be a 2-of-2 multisig with the trader's key and the service's key).
It is also viable to do it as a fidelity bond/proof-of-burn, or a fee paid to the service.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:34:33
A licensing mechanism can prevent traders from backing out. Traders would pay a one-time security deposit when they first start using Mercury in exchange for a license. If they are acting maliciously by not going through with their trades, users can stop trading with the owner of that license (and they lose their security deposit).

For people who want to verify that the proof is invalid:
The signature in Wrights post, is just pulled straight from a transaction on the blockchain. Take the base64 signature from his post:

I'm impressed by the stability of Nubits so far, but right now I wouldn't feel confident enough putting full trust in it not falling apart. This doesn't mean I think it will fall apart, it's just that it's a complicated system and working in the past doesn't mean it will always work in the future. I'm glad the Nubits team is attempting that sort of innovation though.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:56:56
I thought it was a signature too, but it's actually just a cleartext string:

If you can find any specific attacks on the protocol or the implementation, feel free to create an issue on the Github repo ( There are bound to be some implementation vulnerabilities right now, but the atomic swap protocol is solid. Blockstream even included it in the sidechains paper:  (page 21, Appendix C).
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:51:24
I plan to implement licensing, where traders pay a one-time fee or security deposit to start trading. If they back out on trades (maybe after 3 strikes), their license can be revoked and they will lose their security deposit.
Currently the lockup times are 4 and 8 hours, but this is just for the proof-of-concept and can be trivially changed.
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:29:03
Actually OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY effectively *is* a cure-all. With that supported, the protocol can be implemented in a way that the refund transaction doesn't have to be created/signed before the deposit transaction. (This is where the malleability attack comes into play, the deposit is what might get mutated).
Instead, with OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, the refund can be safely created after the timelock has passed, without depending on the deposit transaction having a certain hash.

Maybe Lighthouse should give pledgers the option to still make the donation even if the goal isn't met (using SIGHASH_SINGLE). I'm sure the people who did pledge to Bitsquare still want to donate even though it didn't reach 120 BTC.
