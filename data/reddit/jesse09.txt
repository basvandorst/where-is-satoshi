Might of been interested at a rate of 0.5%.
Not going to pay rent or anything at a 6.25% rate where you end up paying double digits fees that could buy you a steak dinner instead

"Dont kill the messenger"
Isnt one of the responsibilities of being a messenger knowing what you are talking about and doing your research

I havent done a deb. I typically do scientific programming but I really wanted a bitcoin indicator so I dont have to log in or use my phone. I couldnt find one and everyone knows today is a pretty volatile day so might as well do something else.

I have tried sending emails twice but no response. A second order for 300 went through flawlessly.

People should flood his twitter with actual information about Bitcoins like the fact you could buy them on Bitinstant or through a Capital One P2P payment. 
Edit: I have more downvotes than the f'in jews and f u comments for suggesting he could use research being handed to him since he doesnt appear to have done it. Go team.

Yeah dude got ripped off for nearly a grand. I hope OP actually gives him his money.

BitInstant is a joke. I cant believe their popup ads advertisement as useful for arbitrage. My order has been sitting around for 2 days. 
Yeah bitinstant where they expect you to arbitrage something a week after the fact.

Its probably because they cant do recurring charges in bitcoin. They probably get more profit from recurring charges that people too lazy to fight a charge than reversed payments.

Who are the people panicking during a DDOS? Are these the same people who reply to spam emails?

if VC money keeps being funneled into BTC ventures than the big money finance giants might awake and try to sick government stooges on bitcoin

Bitcoin needs at least one sovereign country to declare it official currency for the sake of protection.

I agree he didnt bother to do his research.
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:33:46
A lot of people think seem to think he is getting a negative response because he didnt like bitcoin. The reality is his lack of research is the annoying part.
Research is what should rightfully be expected of journalist and on air experts.

I already went through the support queue and never received a response. Now I get this error when I try to resubmit for quote field which is a required part
-"This field requires a unique entry and this value was already submitted."
Aside from the fact that everyone here knows the support queue at bitinstant is the land of abandoned bitinstant issues

DDOS on gox also has diminishing returns since the more people see it come right back up the less likely they are to panic which means smaller and smaller returns to the people DDOS'ing.

I still have no clue why they decided to go with no fee trading. No fee trading is like adding lube to the bots that are reaming them.

Does someone have a list of all exchanges under attack. It would be nice to have an updated list

He pushed the sketchy anonymous angle.
Ignored that you dont have to meet a sketchy guy in a corner to buy them because of services like Bitinstant.
