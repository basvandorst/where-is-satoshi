This is making me regret selling .04 of my (at the time .05) BTC a few months...not that I had better options at the time sadly.

The main issue is where to do the dumping. I guess Bittrex since they're super easy to use and send in and out of.
I'm mostly leaning towards pulling out of Coinbase and holding in my Mycellium wallet.
Is my assumption that sending from Mycellium to my new Ledger post-fork would make it that both my BTC and B2X get sent correct? I feel like that would be the simplest thing to do. I'd want to start a new wallet on my Ledger since it'll be a 24 word backup instead of 12.

Order shows $100.94CAD for me.
Ledger's site gives me 69.52 € which is $105.46CAD, plus it'll take 7-21 days, and possibly have duty fees on top of that since it ships from Europe.
If you don't pay with Bitcoin on Cryptoasylum then yes it's around $115CAD. But $10 more to have much faster shipping, no duties, and a Canadian company to deal with for any potential customer service issues seems worth it.
