U gotta have a pair of brass balls to make money in this game bro. Advice like that is why people waited for 15k+ to buy

It’s not exactly a secret yet it blows my mind how the average normie isn’t bothered by this at all! “Ohh don’t worry the government has our best interests in mind!”

Not every businessman was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. You have no idea how hard some of us work to get to where we are. Plz don’t let you bias against the “born rich” cause you to hate on anyone whose doing well in business.

The media constantly portrays him as some sort of crypto ambassador I’m sure you know that. He had a responsibility to live up to that and he failed utterly
@_date: 2019-04-12 21:22:57
Lol in the next bull run this will not be sustainable friend
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:29:30
What are you talkin about bro.

I don’t support Bch but this is a slippery slope. Bsv had it coming but let’s reign it in there for the time being imo.
@_date: 2019-04-17 17:04:54
If we de list every scam coin we will only have a couple of coins left on binance ��
Also it has way to much volume on bch, exchanges will never give up the fees
@_date: 2019-04-17 17:33:50
Talk about red flags!
Referring to the countries in red guys relax lol
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:39:19
Well when bitcoin first came out it’s intention was to be a currency and the dev work reflected that. Then for a few years we saw a lot of online companies start accepting bitcoin and it looked good for a while. 
Then as merchants realized how unstable it was and many got burnt by holding it thru large dumps, also long transaction delays and high fees, many merchants stopped accepting it meanwhile average person who bought bit coin was to HODL not spend it. 
So right now the HODL mentality has taken over and I don’t see that changing until price stabilized and merchants get cool with it again. Either that or they will start to accept like usdt type coins and everyone will have to swap their btc out for this to purchase.

I think lite coin is destined to drop form top 10 in the next bull run. Charlie Lee is a scammer and I don’t buy any coins with scam artists at the helm
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:34:10
As much as I dislike it many traders have got rich just shorting the fuck out of this market. The smart ones are taking their foot off the pedal right about now. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:22:19
Heh I laughed
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:37:04
I’m legit starting to get excited looking at that graph
@_date: 2019-04-12 18:32:56
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:27:47
I mean crypto enthusiasts using it as a currency is another story from main stream jo blo using it to pay for his morning coffee and it won’t go mainstream as a currency until thst is happening
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:54:01
I also got it. Sad. Very low energy

Mcaffee is such a clown and a embarrassment to all of crypto.
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:07:20
Bitcoin still isn’t great for buying stuff. Merchants won’t accept a coin that fluctuates this much it’s a big risk for them! Also people are too busy hoarding their coins to consider selling them. Bit coin as an actual currency seems a fair bit away rn. Store of value for the time being.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:53:46
Lol the ignorance is real
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:38:25
For the sake of argument what about those who say when the fiat crisis does come, people will be significantly less likely to invest in something as risky as bitcoin. They will be mostly broke and unable to afford it and the little funding they do have gonna go to feeding their family ??
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:39:13
We owe the federal reserve banking system. What a racket huh
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:26:24
Lol thank god the spelling  police are in town!
So let me guess every single coin except bitcoin is a total scam right ? Bch is a shit product and awful leader ship but it’s not a scam. 
Bit connect was a scam one coin was a scam. Bch is just a bad investment. You can’t go around banning every coin you don’t hold just because.

Alex Jones didn’t murder someone and let Hookers shit in his mouth. Mcafee might be more well spoken but I’d rather hang out with Alex Jones any day.

As much as I hate roger ver this above comment is just so toxic. Main stream media sock puppet alert!!
@_date: 2019-09-05 13:39:02
Truth be too I do sort of feel like any steam we had behind us on a possible summer-fall bull run has indeed been vented and we need fomo to start building all over again.

At the end of the day both parties are controlled by the exact same lobbyists and corporations. This big gulf of disagreements is just a slight of hand to make you think your vote is having an effect. Notice how they all seem to agree on spending a tonne of money on military and violating our privacy to the max?
