Someone narrowed down who Satoshi Nakamoto could be to like 13 people unless it was truly just some complete rando with absolutely no credentials in the field of cryptography. It would be hard to believe someone lacking credentials in cryptography would hit gold with their first crypto (Bitcoin).
Basically it has to be someone who was heavily involved in the 'cypher-punk' movement of the 90s.

The fights were actually serious more often than not

What I meant is that say I bought 5 ETH worth of mining equipment, in a little under a months time I will have mined that amount of ETH after subtracting electrical costs.
As to the sitting out and waiting until now to buy, I go back to no one knowing the future. Of course in hindsight it is very obvious what the best course of action is.

My theory which has yet to come to light and your theory that he has nothing in the pipeline.

Not to mention 2 batches from now Bitmain will be selling S9i's with PSUs for $720.

Definitely. Expect something announced from Bitmain in the mid/late August time frame. They just released what their pricing for S9i's in their next 2 batches will be and let's just say it's clear they are clearing house. I can only imagine they'd drop the price so drastically to make way in their facilities for the next gens before releasing them to the public.

I wouldn’t be too quick to call them doorsteps but yes, they are on the way out.

You want to make a bet on that?
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:41:11
That depends entirely on when you start mining. I started mining towards the top of the bull run and unless we see some crazy increase in coin prices soon I will officially have been better off buying hardware and mining with it than buying the actual coins in a little under a months time.
Basically, unless you know the future you have no way of knowing whether mining or buying crypto is the better option.

Electric efficiency and Bitmain is very smart. I'll explain what I mean by calling Bitmain very smart.
Bitmain undoubtedly knows when other manufacturers will be announcing/releasing their miners, it's a small world in Bitcoin Mining ASIC land. If one manufacturer is coming out with a next gen ASIC then they all are, or they're getting left in the dust, they all get their chips from either TSMC or Samsung now; meaning they all have access to the same components essentially. So with Bitmain knowing others are announcing/releasing next gen miners they hold back on their announcement, they are the industry leader at the moment so they can afford to, and start selling their past gen miners for dirt cheap. (Remember that they were selling S9i's for over $1000 a piece when Bitcoin price was even lower than it is now). By selling their past gen miners for dirt cheap it makes it look like the competitors newer generation is heavily overpriced so people hold out or even buy Bitmains last gen with the mentality of 'I can get 2 S9s which provide even more hashpower for less than 1 of the other guys'.
After these next 2 batches where Bitmain clears house (have you seen how cheap the next 2 batches will be? It's ridiculous) they can come along and announce 'We're shipping our next gen in October' and they will still sell out of all of them. Two reasons for that, Bitmain is the industry leader having the largest consumer draw and they'll likely tune/price their chips to be more efficient and cheaper than the other guys because they can afford too.
Simply put, Jihan knows how to do business.

Are you that daft?

Calm down, you just don’t understand the financial side. No, they did not generate $50M+ in fees.
When someone buys a Bitcoin for $4,000 through Square that is actually ear marked as revenue because of how they do the accounting. When they execute an order they are giving you a Bitcoin of their’s, which you are buying from them (generating revenue equal to full BTC price), and they are replacing the Bitcoin they gave you through buying one on the open market. In the end Square just keeps the difference in fees while getting to up their revenues.
That’s why it’s marked as Bitcoin revenue. Now the issue I have with the number is I want to know how much actual Bitcoin they handled.
That being said maybe stop this shitpost comment BS. Do some critical thinking and digging before having an outburst.

There's nothing illegal you can do in something that is unregulated...
