Okay I'm as skeptical as anyone else but one thing I have to take in consideration is how much he's hyping this. He had no reason to post this video after the 4-5 tweets he made about bitcache and bitcoin going mainstream. All of this is documented. Would he be completely BS-ing if we are going to find out either way soon enough? Why hurt his reputation? 
Maybe the bitcoin going mainstream part is exaggerated, but I'm willing to bet he definitely has something big in the works

The inflation is already way too high, and will be even after being cut in half unless demand suddenly picks up. Rich investors who could affect the price will still keep picking up coins from OTC markets and keep the exchange price stagnant. They will dump their coins on exchanges when the price tries to move up and thus still keep the price stagnant. That's how things seem to be going anyway

I don't follow? Either way, the Venezuelan currency is on a guaranteed decline, at least there's some hope of recovery with bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-10 16:50:37
Soo, in other words... the big investors will keep buying from OTC markets, therefore not affecting the price, not creating fomo or sudden demand by public since the price keeps going down.... they keep doing this until 90% of all bitcoins are bought up from OTC markets while the price remains at mid-200$.... then when/if the price starts to approach $300, they all dump their coins in the exchange and cause another crash that fuck us all over. 
This is great! 
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:19:05
What he's saying is reasonable... Notice that he doesn't say $1M in today's purchasing power. Assuming that bitcoin wont be 'killed' since that's very unlikely (or damn near impossible) at this point, and assuming that the dollar will continue its decline in value through inflation (it lost 97% of its value in the last century) it's entirely possible for bitcoin to be worth $1M sometime in the future... it may take 100+ years though, and that $1M might have the purchasing power of $1K today.

If XT caused bitcoin to fork in two: 75% hashpower with XT/BIP101 implementation; 25% hashpower with no XT/BIP101... where would my bitcoin fall into?

Coinbase has done a lot of good in the bitcoin space; promoting bitcoin's legitimacy, spreading awareness and making it accessible to public. I got my first btc though Coinbase, and I felt comfortable because they made the process simple and my money felt secure. They're not an anonymous off-shore company without liabilities so I let them hold my btc initially.. I didn't have to immediately dive into the whole concept of private wallets. I have no doubt they helped a lot of other people in the same way.
If they have incentive to make money through other avenues, that don't include bitcoin, to grow as a company who cares? That is what corporations do. PS-I have no affiliation w/ coinbase

This is the most useless question you can ask. No matter how skilled someone is in trading and how much of an expert they are in bitcoin... no one knows the answer. And no one should. 
If you want me to guess, I don't see the price going above the $300-level anytime soon. Although 2 months is a long time, we could be $50 above where we are now or $50 below... that range would be my guess.

Retrace EVERYTHING  from Kraken and Bitstamp through the history (total money spent and # of bitcoins bought) 
You should be able to find out how much you spent through Circle by looking at your credit/debit card statements... The history must be there. 
Add up all the BTC you ever bought, add up all the dollars you spent for all your BTC purchases. Subtract all the BTC you sold from you total BTC purchase... this should give you the # of BTC you have currently. Subtract the money you got back through selling from the total amount of money you ever spent on bitcoin. Now divide that amount w/ # of BTC you currently have... that's your average price per BTC

But i am not book smart, and I don't fit in to the mold that life has created to determine who is smart and who is not. I can work hard for 30-40 years and IF I get lucky, play the corporate politics game flawlessly, and kiss just the right amount of ass MAYBE i will climb the corporate ladder to the point where i'll make the kind of money I want. But i'll be over 50 by then, and i'll have wasted my youth missing out on the REAL priorities in life: family, adventure and self-enlightenment-- because I was busy working so hard for someone else. That fucking sucks. 
Lets face it, besides family money is everything. Money brings real freedom, unless you enjoy slaving away in a fabricated routine with the rest of the population. 
Since my college GPA was meh, and Im no corporate superstar  .. my only hope of freedom is by getting lucky (ie-bitcoin) or by being a criminal. I'll probably end up pursuing the later.

How to cash out: 
1. open an account in coinbase.com , transfer your bitcoin (from changetip website) to coinbase.com and withdraw to your bank acct
2. find a bitcoin ATM 
3. Save it, hold on to it, watch it be worth $20 or more next year.... or go lower 
4. Use it to buy something off newegg.com, dell, overstock or microsoft

Well since bitcoin can be anonymous and programmable, i'll jump through whatever hoops I have to or convert it to fiat first depending on which route is cheaper. 
But if government getting involved in blockchain helps bring in money to bitcoin's market cap thus making the price per btc much higher, I am game. I have my own financial freedom to worry about

No one fucking knows. There's a good chance the value will keep rising well beyond the thousands, and there is also a chance that bitcoin will sink and be remembered as a neat experiment. The bottom line is that there is a risk, just like any other bet that can potentially make you money.

You just said.. "you don't know how hard I work for this" and you don't even work. Saving up a $1000 through your parent's allowance and lunch money is not the same as working hard. You shouldn't even be complaining. You're lucky to even know about bitcoin at such a young age.

Bitcoin has stability.... what?
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:27:20
You know honestly, I think it's safer to leave it on Coinbase. This isn't some shady ass Asian/European exchange. By keeping it in your PC you have to MAKE SURE you don't get a virus, HD gets damaged and unreadable or you don't format your computer while your wallet is still in the local drive. 
If you print it out in a paper wallet.... well, you better hope you don't lose it, or the paper doesn't get damaged where the key is ineligible.
To me, it's more likely these scenarios will happen than Coinbase shutting down, getting hacked or running off with your money

It's only exciting because you expect this amount to increase in value over time, in fact.. you are probably convinced it will.
How will you feel if the amount you have in BTC right now loses 70% of its purchasing power by next year? Saving will not be as exciting then, obviously. I'm not saying it's gonna happen... but imo the price matters a  lot. Some people will say "lol I can still buy coffee if the price is $10/btc so it doesnt matter hehe".. those people are idiots and fail to see the big picture
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:59:22
Demand is higher than last year before/post bubble, but the supply and sell pressure from miners is high too. Whales are playing with the market shorting, the market is still recovering from Mt Gox and other image blows to bitcoin, China is not in the game w/ full force like last year..... these are some of the reasons the price is low right now. Just wait and see what happens next year

How exactly?? Your only argument is that success = merchant adoption, and all merchants don't hold/sell bitcoin. What if later they start holding? What is bitcoin is used just as much as fiat so its selling pressure plateaus and availability declines? What if the market cap goes from $4billion to $50billion?? That is not counted as success?

We got a lot of negative news this year, particularly Mt Gox which really hurt bitcoin's image. Coupled by the fact that last year's bubble was a hype bubble (partly pumped by China) that would eventually collapse anyway... but thanks to a LOT of bad news and market manipulation the downtreand may have lasted longer than expected. A lot of people expected Wallstreet ETFs to open this year which didn't happen. But this + tons of other VC developments and new startups are in the works....the bitcoin ecosystem is still growing and will get to the point where it will be more simple and convenient for the masses to use. M$ accepting bitcoin and being one other big-named merchant to embrace bitcoin is a stepping stone towards bitcoin becoming synonymous with Visa, which may happen in the future. The incentives for merchants and consumers alike are there, but the foundation isn't (yet).
A lot of these advantages that bitcoin has over our current monetary system will be realized when the foundation is developed; the fruits of this labor will take time. We have about a million users who own bitcoin right now... do you think it's unrealistic to imagine that number can grow to 50-100 million over the next few years as more merchants accept bitcoin, as bitcoin becomes easier to use, as bitcoin applications evolve, when wallstreet opens up their ETF, etc? Think about how many people will be able to own a single bitcoin at that point. 
Of course things can go to shit from something unexpected too, nothing is guranteed... but don't let the bear market right now make you think bitcoin has somehow lost potential.

You're talking about purchasing power, but this is not what he meant. The "value" of gold and fiat is driven from believing that the government acknowledges and guarantees its value, and that people will also acknowledge its value.... otherwise they are basically a shiny rock and a piece of paper.
It's almost the same with bitcoin, except it doesn't depend on people to guarantee its value, it just requires people to use it. Bitcoin takes all the best properties of a currency and through its structure (mining, cryptography, blocks, confirmations, rewards, supply rate, etc ...aka "laws of mathematics")..... we know it works. We know it can't be copied, we know there's a limited supply, we know there is transparent ledger and we know it can be sent back and forth across the world without the need of a middleman. 
That is the "trust" that bitcoin guarantees that no other currency can bring without inherently having to trust other people or a central authority. Now the more people that use bitcoin the higher the purchasing power goes up via supply/demand, going back to your point.

I've had computer HDs fail ever since I can remember where all my data was lost. Yeah I can create backup wallets, but if I wanna hold for years I will need to remember where I kept the wallets, what my password was and make sure it stays clear of any future viruses... or else I'm fucked and basically lost $20,000

If you bought bitcoin at $500 and it goes down to $2.... not only will you need to wait until it goes back to $500 just to break even.... you lost the capital you could have used to buy at the low price; for every bitcoin you bought then, you could have had 250 now.

The high inflation and sell pressure are outpacing the current demand.

Fiat value = purchasing power. It's a metric to measure bitcoin's purchasing power. Who the fuck would not be excited about having greater purchasing power? Not everyone in the community are anti-government crypto anarchists, and you certainly don't decide what this community should be like. No need to act like a dick buddy. 
I agree with OP. I understand bitcoin and i'm well aware of the potential, but it was pretty damn exciting to see my money raise in value. I also believe it will happen again, it may take years but i'll be damned if we don't pass ATH at some point again. Let the infrastructure and popularity develop and see what comes down the line.

Wtf are you talking about with that random ass comment? More people using bitcoin is what's needed for price to go up. There is a supply limit and more demand will increase the price, it's pretty fucking simple. Block halving reduces inflation (rate of supply) and it really shouldn't magically cause a rally, but of course idiots will panic when that time comes and the price doesn't rise like a rocket ship

If we are lower than $1000 in 5 years, as in if we never went above $1000 again, then bitcoin is fucked... my reasonable guess would be around $3000-5000, and this is because we have been in a BEAR market all year with no light at the end of the tunnel.

This is not designed to be perfect from the get-go. Like the other dude said I think there will be an equilibrium when the demand/usage catches up with the supply, but 2015 will most likely be a continued downtrend. The rate of coins being released everyday is ridiculously high... but there are only 21million coins total, so as bitcoin becomes more useful more people will use it and thus the demand should catch up and the price should eventually rise. That is the big picture. A lot of its utility and applications are still yet to be realized.

When there is no limit to how high the price can go and when whales can control volatility how would this NOT be used for speculation?? Use some goddamn common sense.
The speculation phase may start dying out when bitcoin reaches a level of adoption and market cap high enough that billions of dollars won't affect the price... but there is no shortcut to that stage

@_date: 2015-01-05 16:08:52


I think your logic is mixed up... the price will drop when the selling pressure is far greater than the demand (people purchasing bitcoin). There are about a million or so people who currently own/use bitcoin. What if adoption increases so much that there 200 million people who use/own bitcoin.... if there are only 21 million total bitcoins ever created, how many of those people will be able to own one whole bitcoin? Not that many... at that point the demand may start to outpace the supply and the price will need to rise significantly

You know, I want to get a hardware wallet, but honestly I have a bigger peace of mind with my btc in coinbase. It is a relatively safe exchange, definitely safer than GOX and Bitfinex despite the hate they get. With a hardware wallet I feel like I would be worried about losing it, or forgetting the password, or having it not work one day or accidentally corrupt the file or something along those lines. Do you worry about that? How do you make sure you are never gonna lose access to your btc.

But if it were me, I would have put that money into bitcoin... all of it. There is no indication that bitcoin is dying, if the rate of adoption and utility continues... and I think it will only increase with the infrastructure/accessibility being developed... I do not see the price staying this low over the years to come. Rate of inflation is outpacing the demand right now, but I think the demand will eventually catch up.

He still shouldn't add fuel to the fire when the cat's out of the bag... intentions behind the BU movement is becoming clear, the fact that it takes bitcoin to a more centralized route and is going against the vast majority of the community's will is becoming clear. We don't need to resort to UASF risks, Jihan is not gonna mine a shitcoin w/ majority hash without the rest of the economy that gives bitcoin value. This debate can end very soon but those statements from Voorhees was counter effective 
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:13:51
There are checks and balances in play, miners can't do whatever they want and that's why we're in a stalemate right now. All we've had are scares but at the end of the day even Jihan knows he'll end up losing if he forces a fork. The experiment is working so far but yes this is a test

Move  is enough to end the civil war. I never associated Core with r/bitcoin's foolish censorship. As far as  people are beginning to believe that Core is purposely crippling bitcoin to make way for their own agenda. I don't believe that at all, but I don't fully understand why they refuse to do any block size increase. Even if they just plan for a conservative 2MB block size in somewhere in their roadmap, along with SegWit and LN I think that would be enough to make the community happy and end this civil war. Again, I don't understand why a HF is out of the question; obviously the Core knows the risks and implications better than I do, but from what I've read and understand it makes little sense to avoid it with so much consensus in the community. Maybe there's a knowledge gap going on, I don't know. Either way, here's to hoping this civil war ends soon; and I agree with OP's sentiment--- thank you Core for your hard work, hope you don't get discouraged, we're in this together

I'm basing it on the 20 or so exchanges that came out supporting Core, the entire technical community that are contributing to Core versus the a 6 or so BU devs who are now making closed source patches, and the overwhelming support of Core against BU that you see on twitter... even on Jihan's page, even on Ver's page, you see a clear majority voicing their opinions against BU. If this was a true divide as the hashpower suggests where are the BU supporters? The good thing about twitter is that you can't fall behind your censorship argument 
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:32:01


Then you're either an idiot or not a real "long time hodler"


There are a million more alt coins that exist today that didn't several years ago. Alts are having a typical pump and dump phase right now. Bitcoin isn't *losing* to alt coins like you are trying to paint. This talk about "not allowed" to mention something is far overblown. This sub is moderated from alt coin pumpers and rightfully so, but the censorship BS and claims that we aren't even allowed to discuss BU is simply false and frankly the *only* argument pro-BU supporters have to support BU
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:21:46
The only reason BU is even in the picture is because of Roger Ver and Jihan Wu
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:36:41
It's still a net negative for the short term... I know you're a fan of r/btc but honest question, you don't think that community + the things Roger says gives ammo to the bitcoin haters? It seems like the whole BU camp is trying to convince people bitcoin is in crisis, it's not.
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:13:01
That 20K can either be sliced in half over the next year or grow tremendously within this year and in the long run. That's all anyone here can tell you and no one knows anything more. If you asked me I think it will grow a lot over the years in bitcoin, that's why I invested. There are some obstacles in the way that might hurt the price in the short-mid term but I think it will get though it. There will always be risks if the potential reward is great, and I think the risk/reward ratio is very good

Imagine a bunch of computers that are competing with each other by solving a complex puzzle called cryptography. First one to solve it wins a reward of 12.5 bitcoin (for now). While they are competing they are also verifying the blockchain, a list of where every single bitcoin is at that moment, and also adding to it every 10 mins when the miner who won gets his 12.5 btc. So 10 mins pass, 12.5 btc is recorded at some miner's address that just won it, plus all the other bitcoin transactions that happened during that time, so if I sent you 1btc that 1btc would be recorded in your wallet instead of mine in the updated blockchain. Every miner who were competiting to win that 12.5 btc has participated in varying and agreeing to where all the bitcoins belong, as in which addresses own them, and records it in the blockchain.

Goes down a lot? Lol, good luck with that. $400 is a good price at this time in bitcoin's development. It may go down again but instead of trying to time the market I'd get in at a good opportunity if you're willing to ride it out throughout 2016. I can think of more reasons the price will go above where it is now sometime during 2016 than going down further

Coinbase is my preferred choice, Circle is good too... both are very simple and user intuitive. Even if you don't buy bitcoin I recommend you set up an account now because it takes 3-4 days to link with your checking account. 
Personally I think bitcoin is a better hedge against gold, and I think some of golds market cap will flow into bitcoin in the future. Gold gained its status because it cannot be forged and it is scarce, durable, and fungible. Bitcoin has all those properties and more, and it's actually useful. The chinese are buying bitcoin to protect themselves from the yaun devaluation, not gold-- or not as much

I expect it to continue at least for the next 3 weeks, then drop after halving and then pump again (the real pump) when the outlook for the yaun looks worse than it is today and when US officially heads to a recession. 
You know you're asking a question no one can answer right? But personally at this rate I think $1000/btc is achievable within the year, if not in the next few weeks. 
 &gt;And should I invest in some today?
In my humble opinion, yes

Bitcoin is NOT READY for mainstream transactions. It needs to grow in the avenue it excels at *right now*, which is being gold 2.0. It's far better than gold and gives people full control of their money and protection against hyper inflation and capital controls. Let it grow as an investment vehicle first, let the tiny market cap rise to a level where handful of people won't be able to cause volatility, let innovations like LN scale bitcoin beyond Visa, then it will be ready for daily shopping. As more and more people are acquiring bitcoin, merchants will have more reason to adopt it, as better infrastructure is being built around bitcoin, the more convenient it will be to use over a credit card. This doesn't happen over-night and I strongly believe it is properly focusing its growth where it needs to right now.
Only short sighted idiots expect bitcoin to be used for daily shopping and extreme merchant adoption right off the bat.

Where do I report this extra information about my bitcoin transaction? From the IRS perspective it will look like I profited from BTC when I moved a bunch from Coinbase to Poloniex.... but I lost a lot of those BTC, do I still pay taxes on it? Would my tax return specify what part of my due taxes are going towards 'assumed' BTC profits? How would I even know what I'm being charged?

I trust Coinbase security more than Circle's though 
And let's be real here, they get more hate than they deserve. Yeah sometimes they are shitty.. and they aren't as "enthusiastic" about helping their customers as they were back in 2013/2014 but they still made buying bitcoin easy and helped a lot of newcomers get into bitcoin. There was a time when it was either Coinbase or MtGox... I'm glad I didn't go with Gox

This. I not gonna lose millions of dollars because I forgot a fucking 24 word password, or forget where I wrote down that password, or accidentally mess up the wallet or lose the electrum or accidentally format it and wipe everything out. These are REAL concerns things that happen all the time. I don't always remember my password for everything.
 
People like u/Frogolocalypse just don't get it


And GTFO telling me I shouldnt have bitcoin wtf? I've been with bitcoin for over 4 years... I just dont feel comfortable risking millions of dollars over me losing a password. Coinbase keeps all their coins in cold storage and complies with all US financial regulations. They are more safe than shit like GOX or BFX, period. I can obviously figure out how I can send my BTC to an electrum or breadwallet but I am just not comfortable

@_date: 2016-11-20 06:16:48
Great reasons; also imo:
We are moving to a future where the entire world will have access to the internet (free LTE all over India, SpaceX broadband satellites, Google/Facebook internet.org initiaves, etc)... that's 4+ billion more people that will be connected online in the future, even if 0.5% of them decide to buy or use bitcoin that's a large amount of people and the btc supply will always remain 21M.
As more people use it, it becomes better and more convenient for everyone and increases incentive for others to use it. Apps are getting better and easier to use, adoption and seamless integration will make it more convenient, and adoption will naturally grow.

Having a salary and putting a portion of that salary in bitcoin every week/paycheck regardless of price. Treat it as a long term savings account that you wont touch for a while.

@_date: 2019-10-10 20:22:24
Because I believe having a lot of skin in bitcoin is the smart thing to do. Especially if you’re young. I think the price will easily hit new highs at some point whether we like it or not and the risk is worth it. I’m not comfortable putting money in the inflated real-estate and equities market right before a recession. I understand bitcoin’s market dynamics much better so I stick to what I’m comfortable with. Volatility doesnt phase me at all, it’s much needed. It’s also the only chance I’ll have to accumulate the kind of wealth I want and it’s not even much of a stretch for bitcoin to 2-3x from here in the next year or two

Thanks for the reply. It's a mobile phone app similar to Viber and Whatsapp where you can make calls over wifi.

I also want to include the option to add $ in their account via bitcoin, and make it as convenient as possible since there will be no fees or minimum amount required

Ok, this has got to be one of the dumbest/simple-minded articles I've ever read. 


This guy assumes that the ONLY reason LTC and BTC is on the rise right now is because of 'Grexit'.  First of all if that was the case, BTC would be more likely to be skyrocketing over LTC, but anyone who knows whats going on shouldn't be expecting the Greeks to pump bitcoin. We have just went though a 18-month bear market and just beginning to correlate. It's arguable that bitcoin and litecoin are both undervalued at the moment. Litecoin was down 90%, it has block halving coming up in 50 days that always brings anticipation, it has 97% of all Altcoin volume... it isn't a stretch to think that it was undervalued when it was around $1. The price has been holding strong and finding a new support level after each rise during the last month, it looks like more of a correction than a flat out manipulation.


Oh yes, nevermind the manipulation that went on in order to push the BTC/LTC price down and hold it back during the 18-month bear market. This price correction/reversal going on right now is the real manipulation.... because the price belongs where it was at the bottom of the bear market? And let's compare "3rd grade stocks" to a new innovation in currency because they both make your money go up and down!


And he ends the article giving his expert financial advice, saying if you buy now the price is more likely to go down! 
This guy is a fucking joke. Why do people post these crap articles around here?

@_date: 2017-04-11 23:12:20
Couple of reasons imo:
- It's very hard to understand, most people have only heard the name but have no idea how to acquire it and what to do with it. Even if you get the idea behind it or accept that it's a new form of commodity... you'll most likely still not see the big picture behind why people would use it and what the idea behind it implies.
- There's not much marketing behind bitcoin, people naturally learning it, using it and accepting it 
- Bitcoin suffered a few blows that took it a step back in terms of people's preception -- Mt Gox for example. No one wants to buy a currency that dropped 90% in value over 2 years
- Sort of a chicken and egg problem... the more people who acquire bitcoin, the more useful it becomes due to the network. 
- It's simply not ready to be used as currency, it sorta is, but sorta isn't... right now it's trying to capture the speculation / commodity phase and rightfully so. I think with the advancements in the protocol (segwit, LN, etc) and reduced volatility and greater network effect, it will be more primed for adoption.  
But I will disagree with you, in 7 years I would say bitcoin *has* exploded... it's worth $1200 a piece now. 7 years ago most people who knew about bitcoin wouldnt believe it

Sure, but you can't say that about Isreal and France... so I'm going back to dismissing that list completely. But lets just say you're cherrypicking for Iceland on better government. How does this add to my living standards in the US? The infrastructure is far better, the cities are far better, the living conditions are far better. All the hottest tech and entertainment comes here first. All the innovation happens here first. All the best jobs and opportunities are here. 
How will my life in Iceland be better because the government supposedly *cares* for its people? 
Yeah, healthcare sucks in America.... but everything is far less expensive and average salary is higher too. 


In what way? I can buy a mansion + car in the US for the price of a small shack in Iceland. How is this better living standards? 


The fact that you gloss over something as important as PHYSICAL LIVING CONDITION to prove a point shows that you're cherrypicking.

Please read this. You keep simplifying the argument labeling "small blockers" as people who don't understand economics. C'mon Roger... No one is opposed to scaling, but people are rightfully opposed to a DANGEROUS hard fork that you are spearheading. There is too much at stake for bitcoin to have a competing chain. No one wants that kind of uncertainty. If you want bitcoin's value to plummet and give another altcoin a chance to surpass bitcoin this is how you do it...so please don't. Lets work together like the good old days

Nope, that is bullshit 
Nothing wrong with people wanting to hold on to their BTC. The first stage for it to become a viable currency is for people to actually *want* bitcoin. In 2013 almost every merchant who accepted bitcoin would immediately switch it for dollars. What good does that do? Bitcoin wasn't ready for that stage where people actually want to acquire it and hold on to it. It was too volatile and too risky... now it is slowly becoming a legitimate store of value and people actually want to hold on to it. People are entering bitcoin because they see its value as an appreciating asset, this adds liquidity, reduces volatility, grows the network and gives merchants incentive to accept bitcoin as payments. It's heading in the right direction, there are steps before it can become the currency you want it to be, stop rushing it with your short-sighted bullshit

POW makes barriers to attack very high, you gotta put out a boat load of $$$ to overpower the rest of the miners in order to attack the network. There will always be a blockchain secured by POW even if it's just Bitcoin, and people can be assured by its security, especially since mining is a highly profitable business and big dogs like Samsung are entering the field, and I think more will come.  DAG is untested, we have 10 years of history that proves Bitcoin's resilience and security, and the incentive model behind POW works.
The environmental concerns regarding mining is absolutely bullshit, it's what no-coiners like to bring out these days because all of their previous arguments-- bitcoin is a scam/fad/criminal/etc-- didn't work out for them. The environmental impact is very small, and if you want to talk about energy consumption, you need to acknowledge we spend a whole lot more energy on fiat currency-- the electricity for the buildings, the accountants, the printing machines, the safety vaults, the armored trucks-- all of these combined are necessary for fiat and they consume way more energy than Bitcoin's miners. Bitcoin is a much more efficient currency

I love Ron Paul, and I like Rand Paul for the most part...he has the right mindset imo and doesn't swing too far on the right. Although a lot more than his father. I'd definitely pick him over the other confirmed republican candidates (Jeb Bush &amp; Ted Cruz). 
But he tries to appeal too much to the republicans. He got called out for not being enthusiastic when applauding when that dickbag Netanyahu addressed congress (ridiculous), which I think he did for good reason, but he ended up doing damage control instead of standing up for what he did and how he feels about the entire situation with Israel getting involved in our foreign policy. He also signed the letter to Iran that basically shit on the President and undermined our nuclear negotiation deal for Iran... and in an interview I saw with him it seemed like he didn't want to sign that letter and knew how fucking stupid it was, but he's trying to appease to the right wing. 
Rand-- stop trying to please the right, I usually side with the left/far-left but I will vote for Rand over Hillary if he can stand his ground, be honest and not stoop down to the ranks of Ted Cruz where undermining the President, because he's black/democrat, takes priority over passing bills that are good for the country. Unfortunately this is how the republican majority congress is right now.
But Rand accepting bitcoin donations is another piece of evidence that maybe he's open-minded.

Yeah, ok, don't give me this bullshit. The only reason the Constitution is cited is because they are basically saying that when the president is out of the office, we can fuck whatever deal he makes because our country is so divided that we can't agree to anything. It was essentially a threat to Iran saying no matter what deal you agree on with the President, we will do the opposite when he is out of the office, thanks to the Constitution. So don't take Obama seriously! Fuck the 5 other nations who were involved in this complicated negotiation process, because America is bipolar and shouldn't be trusted. There is NO other message they were trying to send to Iran.... LOL if you think the Republicans are trying to explain our Constitution out of kindness or because they are worried about Iran's well being. 
It makes our country look weak, it shows the international community how divided our country is, and it definitely makes democracy look like a flaw.
And why won't the Republicans agree to a nuclear deal with Iran---when in reality this deal strengthens our relationship, boosts Iran's economy which will help its people and actually makes Iran less prone to developing a nuclear weapon---because the Republicans are on Netanyahu's dick. I have no clue why anyone with a half brain would believe a man like Netanyahu who clearly has an agenda, constantly lied about Iran's intention and capability in the past and his lies have been exposed over and over and over again, even by his own defense administration at one point... it's probably because the Republican's only agenda is to get in the way of anything Obama is doing. It's fucking pathetic that the Israel, a country of 8 million can divide a powerful nation of 330 million and the lunatic Republicans are giving more weight to the proven racist/bigoted/lying Israel PM over our own President.
EDIT - I may have misunderstood what you were saying, I thought you were supporting that letter to Iran, but I agree with your statement below:

Don't let people confuse you with "cold storage" carp. Assuming you're from the US, just open an account with Coinbase, link your bank account to Coinbase following their instructions, then buy bitcoin from Coinbase. It's easy, just go to Coinbase and open an account. 
Once you get familiar with bitcoin and how it works, then worry about transferring your BTC into cold storage if you want. I've had all my BTC in Coinbase for the last 3.5 years and they're fine.

That's not the point. There are known anti-bitcoiners and buttcoiners that hang out in r/btc and is supported by the community even when it is clear that those people are actively trying FUD/hinder bitcoin-ie Jorge Stolfi-who admitted he wants bitcoin to fail. People like ProHashing who also makes fear mongering/doomsday FUD posts regarding bitcoin gets rebutted here but praised in r/btc with his last thread going to the top... he's been consistently wrong and FUDs bitcoin for Litecoin yet he finds himself at home in r/btc. When newbies ask about purchasing bitcoin in r/btc there are at least a couple of people who suggest buying an alt-coin instead and they get upvoted. These are the guys who supports Mike Hearn who also tried to sabotage bitcoin. 
There is a clear trend here. It's not just about "welcoming contradictory opinions"... they do NOT welcome contradictory pro-bitcoin/pro-Core opinions.

Regarding this part, even to gain 10% of hashing power you're gonna have to drop an exuberant amount of capital and on-going maintenance costs. A government entity will have a tough time getting that budget approved solely to kill bitcoin, and a single entity, even if they have the capital, may not find the result worth while for the cost. And if they do engage in this tactic, they have to assume the other miners and devs won't end up doing what's best for bitcoin overall since everyone has a stake in the game.
This is one of the reasons bitcoin is far more secure than other alt coins as it's prone to a 51% attack. If bitcoin splits of course that security gets a cut. And I just don't think a HF that ends with two BTC chains is worth it

Idiots in r/ethtrader, r/cryptocurrency, and here too tbh, don't understand that blockchain is about application, not "tech".... this is open source software, any "tech" can be copy/pasted or done through added layers, but everything comes with a tradeoff. A blockchain makes it possible for us to have an entirely new asset class like gold, that is completely independent of any authority or organization, that can be sent anywhere in the world directly between two parties without either of them requiring to trust each other or anyone else. You gotta be a fucking idiot if you don't see how valuable that is. It gives people a financial freedom in ways that was never possible before, because with bitcoin's governance and security, you can trust that your money is safe and no one can ever take it away from you (ie- DAO from eth). You can argue not everything NEEDS to be as decentralized as Bitcoin because decentralization is not always efficient. But sound money/digital gold/store of value/pocket swiss bank account/financial sovereignty DOES and there’s nothing like Bitcoin. As far as I'm concerned, until today Bitcoin IS the best application of blockchain. We have 10 years of history of how effective and resilient the Bitcoin blockchain is. The other shit has yet to prove themselves, the MASTER Satoshi himself who gave us "block chain tech" used Bitcoin as the official application, digital gold that's also cash that can be sent anywhere peer-to-peer. LMAO at the dumb fucks who think any shitcoin with a "block chain" - like Tron, XRP, 90% of the top 100 - gets all the properties of an evolved blockchain that's true to its nature like Bitcoin's.

Roger Ver wants BTC to HF and have two contentious chains like ETH vs ETC. He claims that Ethereum became better that way which everyone else knows is laughable. 
ViaBTC and Roger Ver's pool is blocking SegWit and will continue to do so with ~15% mining power. SegWit is pretty much at a standstill and the much needed scaling relief is not going either direction for the foreseeable future.

Question -- If blocks remain 1MB forever, how will miners be able to profit once all BTC is mined? 
Assuming transaction fees will remain more or less the same as they are today regardless of higher BTC price, and miners only get 1MB worth of transaction fees every 10 mins with no new mined BTC.. how are they going to be able to maintain their mining business and maintain the security of bitcoin?

This should be much lower if BTC price is significantly higher, as you'll be spending less satoshi per transaction fee.

The evil twins from "The Social Network" are trying to open a bitcoin ETF. Tomorrow (10/12) a decision will be made for one aspect of the approval process (not approval of the ETF itself).
So don't expect much. But if/when a bitcoin ETF does get approved, expect a significant price rise

No, when you convert £50 into BTC you get BTC. 
If you want to spend £24.95 worth of BTC you simply choose that amount, form your wallet or wherever you're buying from, and spend it. No need to worry about strings and code
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:54:05
I see them 11.6% at the moment, how are they dropping?
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:13:23
I think you're a bit confused... bitcoins are digital tokens. They can either be verified on-chain (blockchain) or via LN. The only difference with LN is that the transaction will become instant and it can handle a volume of millions of transactions per second. LN still requires bitcoin, otherwise it's useless. With instant transactions and having the ability to support any volume the user experience will significantly improve and there will be more incentive for merchants and users to transact with bitcoin. The price will definitely go higher with LN as the release of LN will mark the end of the block size debate.

What standard? Who's "we"? Bitcoin is used by anyone 
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:36:54


From what I understand, according to them SegWit will complicate the codebase and once it's implemented we would never be able (or it would be much harder) to do a block size increase on-chain via HF. Then we will have to rely on Core/blockstream's 2nd layer solutions for scaling moving forward.

@_date: 2016-10-19 20:55:39
It's r/btc, of course not... 
But just wondering, it is possible--or worth it--to do a 2MB HF before SegWit so everyone can be back on the same page? And we won't have to risk having 50% of miners support BU
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:37:38


How is UASF less dangerous than a HF that is supported by miner heavyweights AND mainstream exchanges? We got hashpower and economy on board. I'm not a dev but this is the closest we have come to an agreement, we're still getting SegWit....BU is dead in the water.... can we just fucking do it, enough with the uncertainty

Also PSA: Yes, I am cherry picking a bit... these are the posts on the front page of both subs right now and obviously it's not always like this. There are also a lot of smart posters on r/btc whom I highly respect (lifeboatz). 
But there are some consistencies I always see between the two subs: 
- r/btc has more threads/posts with personal attacks
- r/btc users FUD bitcoin on a regular basis 
- r/btc has a hostile/divisive attitude towards the community--"other sub" / "small blockers" mentioned on a daily basis
- anti-bitcoin people are welcomed in r/btc and often post there
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:45:58
Yes it is, except bitcoin is more like digital gold/commodity. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:16:42

Because you can spend all day finding one or two cherry picked comments about people hating on Ver in r/bitcoin... I can literally click on ANY of the top threads on r/btc to find several hateful/bitter/personal-attack posts

@_date: 2015-03-23 10:32:10
This is a bad idea imo. What happens when people forget to send a satoshi to "prove" that their account is active? How many people do you think will actually remember to do this, and how many will raise hell when their account is suddenly wiped out? I also don't like the idea of the protocol having the capability of pulling money out of private wallets. Now you don't have absolute control of your money anymore, and why stop there... now this system has the ability to confiscate your bitcoin so if you spend it in a way that's "unacceptable", your asset can be frozen like in paypal or in a traditional bank. And what's with this idea that bitcoin needs to be adopted as a country's official currency for it to succeed? I doubt that will happen in our lifetime and don't even think it would be a good idea. I don't see it as a replacement of fiat; I see it living along with other currency but as a superior version that has its own benefits and gives people greater autonomy.  
Every whale has a price threshold at which they are willing to sell and take profits. As the price increases to new heights there will be less whales, less people who can be whales, and less affect a whale can have on the market. If Satoshi wants to sell all his coins let him, the market will recover, but I think he knows more than anyone how foolish it would be to dump all at once. Let the market organically grow and stabilize itself. Your idea of this short term fix makes bitcoin a lesser currency, it's terrible, sorry. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:33:44


No one here says that. I know Roger has good intentions for bitcoin

Sam (lets call him moral agent) wants to buy coke from Rita, but does not want any traces of his transaction. He wants someone else to relay the transaction for him, and the incentive for that person is that they can charge a small fee. Is it possible for Sam to broadcast that he has transactions which he wants others to piggy-back for him. Is that the idea? It sounds possible, but I'd like to know too.

Actually, you can be completely anonymous with bitcoin, but you'll have to go out of your way. You can acquire bitcoins from another person or through services like localbitcoin and those bitcoins will not have any ties to your identity. There are also bitcoin mixing services available if you want to completely lose trace of your footprint

Yes and no, not only does the weight fall on you to *know your shit* when security is all up to you, but there is no insurance for theft either. Privacy? Again, unless you go out of your way.. your footprints are available to the public


Nothing is free. But if you're speaking in terms of transaction fees, it's not necessarily free, it's significantly reduced


We are going through the effects of inflation atm, high rate of supply with low buying pressure. Look at the purchasing power of a bitcoin from early 2014 to now


Not sure what "theft to fund terrorism" means to be honest, but bitcoin is a baby... the time will come when it is involved in shady deals just like any other currency. And since this is the most convenient currency, aka the "people's currency", it really should be used that way

Overall yes, the supply of bitcoin is still limited at 21M so greater adoption should eat up the available supply 


Not sure what you mean. Microtransactions aren't convenient on bitcoin at the moment, but will be soon with upcoming enhancements. Is bitcoin used for drugs? Sure, so is cash. Is bitcoin *mostly* used for drugs and speculation? Maybe speculation at the current stage, but not drugs

I couldn't find anything either. 
Apparently the man behind MMM, Sergei Mavrodi, got out of jail in 2011 and got right back into ponzi scheming. I wonder what he's running now; it could be linked to bitcoin since Russia recently relaxed their laws around crypto if I remember correctly. I thought MMM got shut down in the 90's though, I wish Bobby was more specific.
Here's an [old post]( from a participant trying to middle man other people through bitcoin. Has some interesting info on MMM, the business model is laughable but it worked

Maybe my logic is wrong but doesn't more mining power translate to greater security of the network? If so would you really want that attribute to reduce? Bitcoin may be far out of reach of a mining-based attacker (ie-51% attack?) now, but in 100 years that may not be the case, especially with reduced mining power because they just don't profit with the fees they make from 1MB block transactions. 
My question was for me to understand if some mining incentive is gone if blocks stay at 1MB, and whether the concerns raised with ViaBTC will resonate with other miners. 
So it seems like miners will only profit from BTC transaction fees (which is limited by the block size) once all BTC are mined, and possibly though things like assurance contract donations. The thousands of transactions that happen on LN will not benefit miners. Is that right? 
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:58:29

When bitcoin is $10,000 a coin it will be far less volatile. When it's $50K-$100K/coin then volatility will be a thing of the past. It's still an experiment, it has a lot of growing to do. But so far so good.

The best time to invest was 9 years ago... the second best time was 8 years 11 months ago.... the third best rime was 8 years 10 months ago. This is one of THE worst times to invest if you look at history and all the buying opportunities we had. But if you look back 5-10 years later, this may still be a sweet time to invest in bitcoin. 
But don't make the noobs feel better by saying this is the best time. Let them chase Ethereum for "early bitcoin investor" status and get burned

I would do it if I had that much to spare. But I believe there's a good chance bitcoin will take off and the price should be higher than the 200s, so you may want to hear from someone who is pessimistic as well. 
People here will give you the usual *"don't invest more than ur willing to lose"* preach but honesty who is "willing to lose" €5k unless you're Bill Gates? Ask yourself if you are willing to take a risk, a big risk with a potential big reward. 
If hypothetically, there was a 60% chance that bitcoin's price will be higher than it is now at some point vs. a 40% chance that it could go to $0....would you do it?

No, I think whales will come and go. Most of the whales from 2008-2010 are long gone by now as they sold off during the massive spikes. Every whale now will have a threshold where they want to exit the market and take profits along the growth phases, and that will be a lot sooner than when the market cap is in the trillions of dollars. By then, unless you have been holding since the early days, you will need a substantial amount of money to even become a whale so there will be less whales in general, besides corporations who end up holding bitcoin. And when the market cap is that high it would probably mean that bitcoin is widely accepted so it would make more sense to  use bitcoin directly instead of selling it into fiat and potentially lose purchasing value.

*"There still aren’t many use cases for bitcoin where better alternatives aren’t also available; however, this could change in the next few years. Some people are wondering why people aren’t using bitcoin to buy their morning coffee, but that misses the point of where the real growth in this digital currency could come from in the future. For now, most people holding bitcoins are using them as nothing more than a speculative investment."*
There's actually nothing wrong with that statement, it's true. But I don't think bitcoin is going to have one single "killer app" that it's waiting for. It will have many different uses as people figure out creative ways to incorporate bitcoin in various apps as a digital/programmable currency...

Go ahead and post it this time... and stick to your friends when you end up being right . But of course this time things could actually be different and you'll end up looking like a fool... such is life, where things don't go your way when it actually counts. 
The risk was higher back then, and for those who stuck through the reward was great. The risk is still there now, albiet not as much as before when bitcoin could have been banned in the USA for all we knew, but there is nothing that guarantees a reward. I don't buy the idea that there will be another bubble simply because it happened before. But I am certainly hoping for one.

Not sure if you're serious. 1MB is doing "serious harm" yet Core agreed to do a 2MB increase at the HK agreement.

I heard this podcast last week, and honestly I thought it was biased and misinformed. They mentioned Classic and XT as *good* solutions that didn't pass solely because miners wanted a congested network for higher transactions fees... that is just not true. Most of the podcast was about scaling and they did not even mention the Core's roadmap with SegWit, LN and 2MB HF, not even once.
And to top it off they interviewed Mike Hearn to give his take on the future of bitcoin... we already know where he stands and the stunt he pulled to purposely hurt bitcoin, even urging people to sell in the 300's, but the average listener wouldn't know this. 
What did you think? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:06:21
Is 4-8MB really that insane? Serious question. 
Before segwit increasing the block size was the only option. Segwit may be more efficient but with 4-8MB we are will be good to scale, even on-chain, for decades. In 5-10 years is a 2T HD even going to cost that much?

I just want a higher price, no matter what happens (hehe). I feel like BIP148 is the big risk in this scenario   HF with 90% consensus isn't as risky as SF with 40% consensus

What a garbage article by a dipshit author. 
TLDR- bitcoin+crypto will crash, you will all lose 80% of your wealth! Ripple and Zcash will prevail though! 


This gave away that this guy is a fucking moron. Bitcoin is actually being used as a store of value, it has saved tons of people from hyperinflation. More money was lost than gained from bitcoin? Just... lol

But most exchanges, including coinbase and poloniex, support segwit2x... that would count as the chain with the users no? Then how is BIP148 going to be the chain with the users when economic majority are on board with segwit2x?  It feels like we (or core devs) are throwing a tantrum when the rest of the economy is in agreement

I'm not saying we KEEP increasing the blocksize... or that we don't need 2nd layer solutions. Of course we do. Your point is that 2MB will get filled instantly, okay, I'll take it. But if what is wrong with accepting 2MB just so we can get segwit activated? After that we WILL HAVE the second layer solutions, and all the hashrate protecting bitcoin, and all the devs, and most importantly remain on ONE CHAIN. BIP148 brings a risk of bitcoin splitting in two chains.... that is the absolute worst case scenario for bitcoin... just to avoid 2MB block size increase? C'mon...
is implying 2MB will destroy bitcoin ("might was well give up") which I just don't buy at all. What is the alternative? Split bitcoin into two chains? Lose 80% of the hashrate? Give me a fucking break

It's obvious they have incentive for the ETH price to rise. IIRC they released an article about how ETH was superior to bitcoin a few months ago.
Their reasoning for not introducing alt coins, like LTC, was because they wanted to be user-friendly and conservative... but they decide to add ETH which is still recovering from a disaster and potentially on-going another one with the split from the HF. Fuck Coinbase

Half of the payment is in Steem (instant) and the other half in Steem Power that pays you weekly for 104 weeks if you cash out. If you hold SP you get a very high interest on it so they incentivize people to home and convert their Steem into SP

This is how bitcoin will prosper. Forget about the complexity behind how it works when you are trying to explain it to a newbie. It is just a digital currency, it takes all characteristics of a commodity that can be used to trade as a currency, like gold was, with limited supply, fungibility, transferability, etc (with all the best properties of a currency)... it's a "digital commodity" that just exists and no single entity has control over it (like central banks do with fiat). If someone asks how that is possible then you go into explaining bitcoin mining, block-chain, and the consensus-based decentralized network.
Now for people to make use of this currency, there will need to be applications. Out of the box bitcoin by itself is not gonna be convenient for most people. But bitcoin is flexible, as a programmable digital currency, and can be layered on top of many different applications; most of which we have not seen or thought of yet.
I forsee new services within commerce that was not possible before done via bitcoin in the coming years. And this is how bitcoin will reach the masses (via applications that uses bitcoin and the blockchain technology). Not by anti-gov anarchist tools telling people to buy and spend bitcoin right now in a cult-like manner. Let the incentive come with the added developments that lead to more convenience, and it will sell itself because it can really transform the world in they way we do payments.

Yeah but I'm trying to be safe from the HF.... Coinbase will not make my coins incompatible to the new chain or some shit. 
What if I have the coins in a nano... do I have to update it to make sure I'm on the right chain... BIP-whatever or risk losing it all? That's the uncertainty I DON'T wanna deal with... so leaving it in Coinbase should be fine right?

I've been on "Awaiting Approval" mode for a week. It was kinda my fault... after I made the withdrawal I forgot to check my email for the verification link... after a few hours it expired, and hence it's been stuck on Awaiting Approval. I don't see an option to resend the verification link either. Submitted a support ticket right away and still no response. 
I also submitted a lvl2 and lvl3 verification to withdraw more than $2K but it's been over 2 months with no updates. I'll let this slide but I really hope my withdrawal in Awaiting Approval doesnt get stuck for months

Is this true? The Chinese miners have more incentive than anyone else to allow bitcoin price to rise. They are they biggest holders, and a price rise to $2000-$3000 will gain them more profit than forcing transaction fees on a congested network. The idea of purposely hampering growth for short term gains sounds foolish as a miner who are the biggest stakeholders. 
Also aren't all the Core Devs American and European? So, there's a balance? 
The free market isn't perfect, but the miners should have all the incentive to not restrict adoption, or to scare people away via a congested network

Do people really believe a small block size increase will void decentralization? Why not slightly increase the block size too? We know 1MB is not enough.... it's just going to get much harder later on. 
Tell me what part of this deal means we don't get segwit? We are still getting segwit. We still keep the miners who contribute to bitcoin's security. No one wants to get rid of the devs like you're saying... why can we all just be on board with this plan? It is 1000000X better than a split bitcoin, which is what the UASF crowd seems to want. The fuck is wrong with people

It does *transactions* fine, it may not be ready for everyday purchasing but shopping with bitcoin doesn't have to be it's main utility. It's got the most secure blockchain by far and that's not changing anytime soon. Just the fact that it's a digital gold surrogate and has a number of advantages over gold should tell you how undervalued this *may* end up being if we're talking about price
