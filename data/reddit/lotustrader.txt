The prices could gap down if liquidity drops. There is no way to know how much it will cost to break the market. If a central bank wanted to buy 60 billion dollars of BTC they could absorb the entire hit but if there were few buyers at these prices 10 billion dollars of sell orders could make the price much lower.

It is starting to sell off now. I think it could drop below $4000 this weekend.

It seems unlikely to me that the regulators will allow BTC futures to trade. Read the fine print, "CBOE plans to offer cash-settled bitcoin futures as early as the fourth quarter of 2017, pending regulatory review." Who are the regulators??? The Feds and they do not want a more liquid BTC.
