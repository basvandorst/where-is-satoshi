Sorry to sour the mood, but how is this relevant to @_date: 2013-03-09 20:28:28
Right, that would be a 2^128 exhaustive search. And 2^128 is less than the 2^187 quoted by Schneier.

In addition to this undocumented API, Bitstamp also streams trades and depth changes through pusher. Their homepage connects to this stream, so the protocol can be figured out pretty easily with nothing more than Chrome's dev console. The URL (currently) is `wss://ws.pusherapp.com/app/de504dc5763aeef9ff52?protocol=6&amp;client=js&amp;version=2.1.2&amp;flash=false`. There were previously stream endpoints with a slightly different protocol under ` but those have since been taken down.
It would be nice to have an official, unchanging stream API - especially since so much of the underlying work is already done, and since scaling concerns can be offloaded to pusher, which they're already using.

Theyomos put out a bounty for new forum software a while back -  I considered submitting a proposal until I realized he'd been ignoring everyone else's proposals for the better part of the past two years. According to that thread, there is 5500 BTC set aside for that project (which was only worth about $12000 back when the thread was made).

According to  (once it's back online), the forum has 5500 BTC set aside for funding better software. That thread was made in 2011, but none of the proposals since then have been accepted. I (and many other qualified individuals, I would imagine) would happily give the community all my time for several years for that amount of money.

That's a compelling argument. I just wonder if it takes into account quantum computing. Theoretically, a quantum computer could brute force a 2^256 keyspace in 2^128 time, so energy-wise at least, it seems like it would still be feasible.
