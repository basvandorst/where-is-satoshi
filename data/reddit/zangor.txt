For real.  Spend an hour or two on every day and learn a few things and you got a stew going.
And by stew I mean a shitload of money.

Directed acyclic graph (DAG) coins like IOTA and/or XRB will be hot stuff in a few years.  Get yours while you can.

We'll see.  Crazier things have happened.
Hindsight is always...*2020*.

Don't transaction fees make this a horrible impossibility?  Something I'm missing?

This is why I have a theory that dogecoin will become dominant.  And I'm not joking.  I believe that because it is a litecoin clone with a psychologically pleasing circulating supply, people will like using it more than other crypto.

Honestly, in the golden age of silk road, buyers and sellers took on an integrity that was unthinkable in the framework of such an implementation.  This was glorious, and I am thankful to have been a part of it.

You can put that x anywhere you like because apparently that's where we ACTUALLY are ALL THE TIME.  Do yourself a service and buy some coins.  Unless you dont like having more money.

Fucking seriously, how do people not realize this with even a small amount of research?

We all have a LOT of some altcoin we stubbornly committed to.  Our day will come...our day...might come...*maybe*.

I'm just imagining everybody new to crypto going to whatever platform to buy and entering in a '1' and staring at it and being like "well, it's this or nothing - sure is expensive but it's not like I can buy a fraction of it."

Yea. Think about it. It couldn't possibly be used as a currency if you couldn't do exact amounts. 
If you're interested in making money, I would recommend buying ethereum right now. It is very undervalued at the moment - btc is still a decent buy as well.

Me too.  That's quite a bit.

My sentiment exactly.

Let me tell you dude.  People haven't been buying socks or coffee - but they sure as hell have been buying 1000 pills of diazepam or 2 ounces or cocaine.
^(and that's how I formed a powerful psychological association with the USPS symbol)
