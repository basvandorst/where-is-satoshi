Add me to the ios waiting list also, please. 
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:23:43
I vote yes - I’m still buying some every 2 weeks.
@_date: 2019-11-29 05:10:49
r/lostredditors ?
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:22:54
Congratulations.  
Please teach me - How are creating earnings in a bear market?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:18:59
BCH on Coinbase should also put it on GDAX, yes?
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:45:16
Too much coin?  How could that be bad?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:09:15
Gosh, that helps tremendously!  Thank you, SirEd.  
A question about the reward vs cost of electricity to mine ... Am I understanding correctly that the energy cost to mine 1 block per 10 minutes is nearly equal to the block reward? (approx $87k?)
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:57:26
Noob here - Please tell me what pow and eda are?
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:24:45
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:21
Holy cow - I had no idea some were so versatile.  Why would they want ASIC resistance if the end goal is to allow folks to solve the equations?
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:27:17
I'm a staunch supporter of Equal right - They can buy their own drinks. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:35:29
Thanks again.  Little by little I'm learning this as a new hobby - and perhaps a new lifestyle. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:09:45
LN = Lightning?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:09:24
Noob here - What makes it incorrect, please?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:04:21
I hope you do well !  :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:06:56
Thank you for this discussion, and - It's very helpful. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:11:28
Do you believe the addition of lighting will have a significant positive effect?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:04:01
Thank you for this video
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:54:19
Thank you
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:52:46
I’ll hodl for ages...
Only because I’m in that sweet, sweet red...  :/
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:14:19
Ahh ... Thank you.  
I had the mistaken idea that the money transfer from my bank was instantaneous. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:49:50
Age 50 here... I’m still a kid. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:10:05
Woot!  I'm already warming up to the idea of a bigger purchase. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:37:53
Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:51:35
Sadly, I assumed this sort of fee was normal.  
Which portal do you use?  What fees do they charge?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:10:28
Thank you, Captain Crypto!
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:37:36
That's a perfectly good point that I failed to consider.  
Thank you for this. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:21:08
Did you eventually find your missing bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:42:35
I love ANY Project Mayhem!
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:02:31
Excellent.  My first purchase is due to post Nov 3 - I'll move them from Coinbase to GDAX once they post.  
Am I correct that in moving them I'll need to create a paper wallet to keep track and prove ownership, "just in case"?
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:21:37
1 week delay. 
Purchased Oct 27 - Will receive Nov 3
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:56:15
That would certainly be convenient.  If they do that they would also have to modify the value of 1 coin, yes?
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:22:32
Which portal do you use for purchases, please?
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:48:10
Congratulations!!  I'm age 50, and already retired ... I'm hoping this generates something to make my 60's full of cruises.  ;)
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:43:20
This was a true belly laugh for me ... well done!  Updoot earned.  :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:05:43
Very helpful info - thank you.  I'll establish a GDAX account today.  Also, I'm finding no GDAX app ... do you know of one?
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:41:34
Thank you - I'll look into this solution 
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:45:23
In s sense, that 60 million (at current value) pizza dinner was good advertising, eh?
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:49:56
Oh?  I had no idea.  As I understood it, I have an extremely tiny portion of 1 'coin'.  
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:02:56
Thanks for sharing this info.  
Have you invested into neo?  What are your thoughts about Ripple?
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:43:30
Huh?  I missed that reference completely...
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:25:41
I do.   Only to say... Mr. President, my name is Khan and I am not a terrorist. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:09:04
I'm banking on it (little by little)!  
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:16:30
Thank you.  I hope you do well with your investments. :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:20:02
Wow ... thanks.  TIL hodl, and tyitle...
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:28:30
I'm not finding GDAX in the Apple AppStore.  Does it go by any other name?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:09:18
Thank you. :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:15:17
Ahh... you mean public interest rather than economic 'interest', yes?  Now I understand. Thanks. :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:41:55
Thank you.  That helps. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:50:22
Simmer down, child...
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:52:46
When you say "send it", are you meaning 'send my buy order'?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:09:39
Meaning you spend your coins?
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:22:09
You're finally in now though, yes?  There's still a lot of room for growth, and wealth. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:56:54
Thanks.  I'll look into neo.   
Edit:  Is there a mechanical wallet for neo that you prefer?
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:43:41
Is one a Tesla?
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:15:56
Ahh...   it worked - I was genuinely puzzled. :p
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:13:54
Got it. Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:54:55
As I understand it, the fee is 1.50 per transaction, regardless of amount.  
Which portal would you recommend for frequent purchases of ~20?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:07:30
Thanks. :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:48:37
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:41:54
As part of my education here, what is ATH, please?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:08:57
So those who I see writing about spending theirs are hurting themselves financially, yes?  At least that's how I see it.  
I have the idea that the coins should be held until the currency is stable and fully (globally?) implemented.  Or... in case of a product crash - which I believe will not happen. 
Am I on the right though track here?
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:45:09
Daily, no.  Frequently, yes.  
Please forgive my ignorance on this topic... How would low interest make me wealthy?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:10:53
Thrilled that you lost millions?  How does that work?  I'd be crushed...
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:36:04
Can you tell me more about how to do it correctly?
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:32:05
Well then... I'm a less than 1 week into it noob with only 0.00347299 coin.   If you're offering, I'm accepting.  ;)
I've never heard of gyft - I'll go check them out.  Thanks for the tip. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:08:26
Thanks.  Serious question... why is 'hold' spelled 'hodl' in this forum?
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:40:19
Thanks, Breeze
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:24:04
Smart strategy - I believe I'll be trying this.  Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:46:06
And then double up purchases during dips, yes?
