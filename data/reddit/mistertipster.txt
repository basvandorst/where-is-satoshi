Thier not going to switch over. Because no one uses accept you.
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:40:36
Bitcoin is worth anything because fools like you, buy and sell to other fools. Just like pokemon cards.
Bitcoin has no use.
It really has zero utility and till today no one uses it for anything at all. 
Its a novelty, a collectors item at this point.
Well it is useful for one thing : money laundering.
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:31:35
I would say 90% of bitcoin is used for money **laundering**  . 
Why the hell would you use it for anything else? It's practically useless.
@_date: 2018-10-27 06:32:36

thank you for wasting electricity
@_date: 2018-10-28 12:31:49
Lol, the price of bitcoin is like a circus. It means absolutely nothing.
Most of the time it's being manipulated by whales. Thats what happened in 2017 and it will happen again.
What is more important is adoption. Which is failing fast.
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:27:02

Haha butt hurt because you know im right.

@_date: 2018-10-20 15:21:11
And yet no ones uses it. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:27:40
Lol, if you really think bitcoin is worth that much you must be new here.
let me guess, you're below 22?
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:09:11
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:18:06
lol, and yet no body uses bitcoin.
Further proves no body gives a flying fuck about this.
@_date: 2018-10-28 12:33:32
What? YOU are a speculator. There is no reason to hold bitcoin then to hope it will rise aka speculation.
(oh and to launder money)
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:36:16
Bitcoin will most probably be used as a speculative instrument only, Regular cash &amp; other alternatives (like mobile wallets) will be used for spending. People will always spend, this is human nature.
I run an e-commerce shop that offers Bitcoin as a payment solution, transactions have not increased in the past 3-4 years. It has declined.
The Chinese market uses mobile wallets as a form of cashless payment (Wechat, Alipay), this is far superior as a cashless payment solution and has gained mass adoption already.
The everyday Joe doesn't care if it's centralized or not, convenience is more important.
I've been in Bitcoin for a long time, and have seen little innovation in this technology. 
It is still difficult to buy bitcoins today then it was 4 years ago. The decentralized nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to improve on the system and that will eventually kill it.
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:23:46
They ONLY people using bitcoin are speculators like you. No body else.
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:17:09
 
The price will go up when the whales decide so.
You do know bitcoin is heavily manipulated by a few large traders right?
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:10:30
You need to get your news from other sources.
People in Venezuela are dying of hunger, they dont even have a fucking internet connection you moron.

@_date: 2017-08-18 13:35:08
you can trace the "coins" back to their origin. so blacklisted accounts would have black listed "coins". 
Eg, a certain transaction might consist of 5% black listed "coins". etc.

Stop comparing BTC with fiat.
USD is used for allot more things then just money laundering. I use it to pay my bills for example.
On the other hand, Bitcoin has little to no utility at the moment - and might never have the same adoption as fiat. 
Money laundering and the purchase of illicit goods is its most obvious utility, hence it is easy to blame bitcoins for this.

You still fail to refute my argument. I can make my own crypto and it would be equally legitimate by your definition. Because they are all virtually useless. 
The only reason why bitcoin is more valuable, is not because it's an improvement it's because people have bought into it. That's all.
In fact, in terms of tech, there are better cryptos out there.

@_date: 2018-03-04 17:59:51
Let me put it in simple terms. In a regulated financial system you can seek legal recourse if something goes wrong. Simple mistakes like forgetting your password can be solved with a centralized system. 
You cant do any of this with decentralized systems. An immutable database is really a dumb-ass idea. No competent developer in their right mind would create something like this.
For this to go mainstream in anyway, it has to be regulated and at least semi-centralized.

If you are really worried about the poor and unbanked, i can tell you that cryptos like bitcoin are not going to help them.
Instead it will make the wealth disparity worst.
To use bitcoin, you need an internet connection and some level of education. People from developed countries (particularly from the tech sector) benefit the most from it. Because of its deflationary nature, early adopters (who are mostly techies) get rich, while the late comers dont do as well. The reality is that rich get richer and the poor stay poor.
Not to mention's bitcoins environmental impact is most likely going to affect the poor more then the rich.
And regarding building support structures for cryptos, what you are really talking about is building crypto banks. Which is really no different from what we have now. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:10:00

You are right! The only real USP of bitcoin is that it's completely decentralized. However there is a reason why people dont build infrastructure completely decentralized - its not very efficient and the cost far out way the benefits.

@_date: 2018-02-28 06:23:13
I can refute just about all of your points. But i dont want to go into a long debate.
One thing i want to point out though, is that bitcoin is not opensource in the traditional sense. Linux is opensource, we can tweak it to our needs and create customize solutions. There is allot more freedom.
However bitcoin requires everyone on the network to agree to an update. This is much harder todo; hence development will be slow. 
Centralized innovation driven by a visionaries (see Elon Musk) will always be faster.

bitcoin has become a religion. Thats great

He spoke about Cryptos in general, not bitcoin. Dont need to be so sensitive.
@_date: 2018-03-04 10:38:55
that still doesn't prevent fraud though. It's also highly inefficient.
A centralized market place will always be more efficient then a decentralized one.
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:32:35
aha, that's an absurd comparison. 
Tencent's market cap is not only 4X larger then Bitcoin it's also used by way more people and businesses then Bitcoin. And Dont get me started on the transaction volume. :)

The CCP dont prop up companies that are not state owned. However they will shut you down if you break their laws. And they dont play around.

Yes this is mainly a western perspective.
Most people trust their banks actually.

IM SURE. I have 100 BTC in my computer right now!

for those to lazy to read : its a cheap hotel that accepts bitcoin.

you can thank Trump for that

I think i won this argument. 
Another one bites the dust. :)

"The reality is that moving fiat into and out of crypto is difficult to do on a large scale. Exchanges which allow fiat withdrawals typically have stringent requirements since they act as an interface to the financial system."
Wrong. 
Unregulated exchanges are easy to game. In fact any country that has a weak financial system and rampant corruption can be exploited. Countries like Russian and many in central Asia are a hot bed of money laundering.
"It's an asinine argument that has been trotted out before and has been found to be largely false"
LOL, you think linking lengthy PDF supports your argument? Your source make no reference to your points at all. Why dont you do us a favor and quote your source accurately?
Try harder friend, ive demolished most of the bitcoin fanatics on this subreddit. You're another one.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:56:55
The reality is that most people from developed countries benefit from bitcoin. You need some level of education to use it. Bitcoin is most probbaly going to add to the wealth disparity.
EG, Rich South Africans were able to move their money out of the country via bitcoins while the poorer ones have never heard of the internet
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:23:40
i could make my own crypto that does the same thing, does that make it valuable too?
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:45:47
Bitcoin has been around for 8 years, Wechat reached mass adoption in about the same time. I think the market has spoken :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:08:56
That is a very dangerous argument. Storing your bitcoins in your PC is the least secure. because you dont know anything about Security.
I can hack into your wifi VERY easily, and install keyloggers. I can record every key stroke and get your key. I can also built worms to spread and do this automatically on a mass scale.
Unless you are a trained security professional, you should NEVER store bitcoins on your PC!
Regulated Exchanges with 2 factor authentication are actually the safest option.
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:01:04
And the solution is Bitcoin? The solution is proper legal recourse. In the courts. Not some flimsy crypto currency my dear friend.
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:42:27
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:31:42
And bitcoin is going to solve that?
You have to be so gullible to believe a virtual currency is going to solve all your financial problems. Its so sad..
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:22:07
lol no. Bitcoin is 8 years old.
Facebook reached a billion users in 8 years. Bitcoin is barely at 20 million. Adoption has been awful, there has been ton of media hype tho.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:56:24
a block-chain is a any distributed ledger. Stop trying to make it seem like it's anymore complicated then it is.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:46:23
seems like someone's never heard of Monero.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:58:52
Selection bias. You have a higher probability of dieing from cancer or heart disease then from an oppressive government. :)
