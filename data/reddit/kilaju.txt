Must be a noob. You hadn't lost anything until you've lost $250K trading naked options in tech in March 2000. I got over that and made some and lost some along the way. Hope and Praying are not a sensible strategy for getting rich. If you can make 3-5% a year - you're doing great. All you millennials think that you can go around making 30% a year, every year, and it's just not possible. Take this as a lesson learned and don't get into leveraged bullshit. Be sensible and invest with your extra dough for the long term. There is no get rich quick scheme in Bitcoin or anything. It'll be alright.

Wall streeters are capitalist pigs that don’t deserve to be mentioned here. What the hell does a stockbroker do? Call pensioners and try to sell them on some stupid shit so they can get rid of it. Never respect a stockbroker - they are all dogs and pigs from the lowest depths of hell. 
They’ll try to ruin bitcoin too with their stupidass futures and derivatives. Look what they did to the housing markets and the millions of poor people who got foreclosed. Never trust these bastards. They’re worse than bankers.

Not to worry. Anytime we all below 14K, I’m selling. It’s the least I can do for my fellow btc’ers. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:45:26
It’s no biggie. I’m just happy we’re north of 15K and climbing. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:50:10
Nah it’s ok. You can take the hit next time it dips below 14
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:55:22
I feel the exact same way. Forget about realizing any profits now - that’s what Jamie Dimon and wall street wants you to do - fuck JD and Wall Street. Hold onto your bitcoins like you hold onto your balls.

Rational people don’t get rich - they just stay rational all their lives. You have to really be IRRATIONAL as hell if you want to hit it big. Listen to this from someone that knows:
This is probably the ONE time in your LIFETIME that you will ever get a chance to make millions. Don’t blow it. Hodl forever cause this thing is bigger than the Internet, bigger than the invention of the printing press, probably even bigger than the invention of the wheel.

I commend you hydrastis. I'll be your first customer. I need you to help me create a paper wallet that will be secure and that I can cash in years later when bitcoin is worth $100,000. Will you do it and how much? And do you accept Bitcoin as payment? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:32:41
Please define the word “sticky” for those of us new to the internet age or over 40 years of age. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:41:25
I love seeing how bitcoin is a worldwide phenomenon. Today I saw ads from Peru, Phillipines, and now Ukraine? What’s next - a billboard from Lichtenstein? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:36:24
“Cup and handle” - so funny. You will “cup and handle” yourself all the way to the poorhouse. All that gibberish is there just to take away your hard earned money. The only sensible thing to do is HODL and DCA
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:12:17
Look there's nothing wrong with noobs losing their money. I'm sure all of have done it. Myfirst stock investment went bust when the Chief Auditor "fell" out of a helicopter. But now I know better.

You can go to betmoose.com too. Very reliable and trustworthy. I've been using it for years. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:01:25
Immune? I doubt it. Already see what the governments are doing? In a few years, when Big Money gets into the BTC space, it will be unrecognizable. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:37:19
Why would this be a scam? Bitcoin is not for the lame or technophobe. There will be lots of opportunities to teach and assist others to learn about btc and block chain. I registered bitcoineducation.com just for this purpose. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:32:46
This guy is such a fuck hole. What a stupid pile of shit. Who listens to this idiot?
@_date: 2016-06-27 03:13:30
It's like...get to the point. And millennials are in their teens now, not 30ish

Next time you need to write a letter to the legislature, call me. This one won't even be read, much less understood.
@_date: 2018-06-20 04:50:04
I second the notion
@_date: 2016-11-05 00:32:37
Yeah, buy it from me. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:02:37
Alt coins are traded by noobs to try and eke out a profit when they can, but 99% of traders fail and the other 1% will fail the day after. No one makes money trading stocks, bonds, or alt coins. The best strategy is to hodl and accumulate as much BTC as you can while the rest of the world plays catch-up. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:52:48
No it’s me. Whenever I sell, the price skyrockets. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:06:43
Ready for the future? With one bitcoin? Well it’s a start anyways. Do the DCA thing regularly and you’ll be amazed how much you can amass before you’re even 30!

I always said that when Uber drivers and your hair dresser starts talking bitcoin, sell. There’s nothing left. 
@_date: 2016-09-25 17:07:55
Of course you can increase your sales! Bitcoin is the Saviour of your industry.
@_date: 2016-09-04 01:38:25
This is all well and good but the real reason Bitcoin went to $600 is because I sold two BTC two days ago. Whenever you want something to go up, sell the underlying asset, get a glass of beer, and get ready to cry in it. 
@_date: 2016-09-20 04:51:21
Whatever. All that mumbo jumbo means nothing. If you believe in Bitcoin and the change it will bring upon the world, then just hold and forget about it. Use it whenever you can. Who cars about getting rich off of it. As if that's the point in life.
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:36:39
What only $14K? I’m expecting nothing short of all time highs when spring comes around.

If 71% of investors expect “substantial increase” then its time to sell and look forward to more hurt. Let me know when 71% of investors expect things to go down, that’s when you get in son. 
Always zig when they zag and zag when they zig - that’s how you make money investing. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:36:27
Exactly my thoughts. Buy, hodl, sleep, buy more. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:26:59
The “bitcoin elite” - who exactly are we referring to here? I’m not sure the elites are really interested in bitcoin - they’re happy with their ETFs and mutual funds. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:17:51
Absolutely.  I’m going to make a thousand of these stickers and put them everywhere like a modern day Bansky!

What’s a piker? 
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:24:03
What a ridiculous video! It said nothing at all. A child could have made this. I live in Detroit and have only seen one Bitcoin ATM in a little place called Lincoln Park. “Some law enforcement officials are concerned” - yeah, they’re concerned that the end of the month is arriving and they are way behind on their ticket quota too. Who cares? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:23:33
Bitcoin market cap will never be worth a trillion dollars, not in your wildest wet dream - are you crazy? You can’t even imagine a million, much less a trillion. 
Bitcoin is probably worth $10,000 at the max. Don’t drink the juice from the container my man.
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:15:47
That’s only $60K USD. Now what idiot kidnapper is going to go after your $60K? They can make that in a week protecting jewelry stores. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:21:52
Same here my man. Early 2014 investor and hodling for the most part. BTC is the Next Big Thing and I for one am glad to be here on the ground floor. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:10:59
The most wealth was made in the stock market? Was it made by day traders or hodlers like warren buffet?

Dude why you so sour? Don’t know how to smile? Let me help you: curl the sides of your mouth upwards...there you go...that’s called smiling. Try it sometimes.

People used to say that in the 80’s when we had patent leather shoes. I don’t anyone’s been shot over sneakers in over 30 years...
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:05:23
No,  see that was a mania at the end of 2017. Manias don’t give accurate values. What we are seeing now and all of 2018 is a re-evaluation of bitcoin. It won’t see $20K again until end of next year.

I'll bet anyone 100,000 BTC this won't happen. And who is this idiot anyways? Talking about markets and globalization like he knows what he's talking about. Maybe when he gets out of his 20s, I might start listening.
@_date: 2016-10-14 03:25:10
Why stop at Bitcoin? Take a full quarter into currency trading, options, and oil futures as well. If you're going to be stupid, at least diversify. I can help. 
@_date: 2016-10-01 00:37:33
No. India and china will never be the topnid the Bitcoin ecosystem in any capacity. It's their education system - taught to learn by rote, copy, infringe on others' innovation, and never to challenge authority. How the hell are they going to be the top in anything?
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:03:51
This run will continue indefinitely or at least until 2030, but then it's anyone guess. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:40:37
Think about it and you'll come to the dismal conclusion that Bitcoin is a government conspiracy to control the one world government that is coming. They needed a universal way to get rid of cash and to track every transaction for ever. Do you get it now my furry friends? 
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:03:00
That article says nothing with so many words. BTC is going up because it is seen by many to be indispensable and the future of the coin is going to be many times more valuable than the present. That is the definition of a rising asset. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:35:00
You dipshits. Satoshi is unknown not because he wants to be but that's the way it is. His real name is Uncle Sam.

Now do you see why Islam abhors interest? Even 1500 years ago, the Prophet rejected an interest-based society. All the West mocked him, but now, and going forward, you will see how truly evil interest is.
