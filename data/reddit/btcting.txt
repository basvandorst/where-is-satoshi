I have a UXTO of 0.001BTC. I try sending 0.001BTC, so it should be just one input to one output, no?

I've watched every YouTube video of Andreas, read his books, read the whitepaper, am running core and lightning nodes, done everything short of reading the codebase itself. I understand the value of Bitcoin. But do you truly believe that it's the technology that is driving this adoption right now, especially in the face of a such a clogged blockchain?

You're too emotionally invested in this and shouldn't be buying Bitcoin. Research the development and technology. Learn something. Don't bitch about price fluctuations in an unregulated and immature market.

Difficulty. If there is lots of hashing power difficulty of the problem adjusts upwards. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:17:25
Lightning was tested on the mainnet and only has a testnet. I'm running a node right now and am looking into contributing to the codebase. It is still an undetermined amount of time away from even a beta deployment, and given the current rates of adoption of Bitcoin, I don't think it will be deployed quickly enough. Slow development is fine, but that only drives the point further home of the level of current interaction being unsustainable.
I'm trying to have a discussion about current market conditions, but clearly all you're here to do is shout "FUD".

Then eviction laws come into play. They exist for a reason and usually strike a fine balance between protecting both the consumer and the landlord.

From the whitepaper, regarding SPV:


SPV does not do any proof of work verification. It accepts the block it receives as fact, and compares hashes to previous block hashes to get confirmation depth (this is the merkle-tree solution you're talking about). Do you really believe my smartphone wallet is serializing and hashing blocks as it retrieves my transactions in seconds? Your description of SPV and node validation is a fundamental misunderstanding of the protocol.
Your description of malicious mining is by definition a 51% attack. You said it would be possible for miners to accomplish this without mining power collaboration. Short of this 51% attack happening, honest full nodes will persist with the longest valid chain and will work to ensure the information miners propagate is honest.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:37:34
I'm saying let's say LN takes off enough to keep chain transactions under 7/second. Block rewards are gone in 20 years. Then what?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:06:05
This extends beyond Reddit. I'm seeing single mothers and high schoolers on Twitter asking how to buy Bitcoin. All anybody is seeing is price. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:13:31
Nobody is claiming every user must run a full node. Decentralization is a driver of what really makes Bitcoin work, which is trustlessness. I don't want to trust anybody. If you remove my ability to run a node without having to spend tens of thousands of dollars, you're making me **trust** a node, at which point there's no point in me using Bitcoin. As long as I have the ability to verify the chain by myself, the trustless property of Bitcoin remains. I don't care how many scientists and researchers run nodes, my SPV client will still have to trust their nodes and trust they're not malicious. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:19:43
Yes, exactly. Segwit transactions are instantly cheaper. Wider SegWit will increase throughput which should result in cheaper fees as well
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:43:37
By all means, I believe in what Bitcoin stands for and what it can accomplish. But has it accomplished enough to justify the level of interaction that it has? This level of mindless "belief" in the system is what drives bubbles. What really got me thinking about this was [Vitalik's]( recent tweets. 
The system, in the simplest of technical terms, is unable to support its userbase right now, and I would argue that people like you and I are of the absolute minority in this current market. People aren't buying Bitcoin right now for its censorship-resistant, decentralized, and peer-to-peer properties. They are speculating on price.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:33:13
No, it just dissuades me from attempting to start the discussion here. I never said anything about not mentioning this subreddit.

So the landlord should be liable for my mistake? You do realize eviction laws exist and have time buffers for a reason, right? Or should we take a totally libertarian approach and let the free market decide, in which case both landlords and tenants will keep fucking each other ad nauseum.

This doesn't really work because of liability and assurance issues. I like the taxi meter usecase more.

Isn't this how things normally work under Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:56:32
Yes, but a block size increase requires consensus and careful planning, so its not easily done and shouldn't be continuously done. It is probably inevitable though. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:11:41
Ah, I should've clarified, I'm asking about how verification works under the proposed MimbleWimble protocol 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:50:16
Its important to realize that there's also an imbalanced reallocation of wealth in Bitcoin. A very small percentage of users hold a very large percentage of Bitcoin. Because of the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin, this imbalance of wealth may be even more troublesome than the current distribution of fiat wealth down the road.
Andreas tried justifying this by saying "Yea, its the computer nerds who have the wealth now, they deserve it for taking on the risk", but if Bitcoin goes global, I don't see much of a difference with the way distribution is now.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:34:44
All SPV does is download block headers from a trusted node, so by definition it requires trusting a peer. If that node is malicious, you've now downloaded invalid information. If I'm running a full node, I can verify the work done to validate every block by downloading the chain, ensuring that short of a 51% attack, the transactions are valid. How would miners collaborate to undo transactions?

They might very well be, I haven't studied the market enough to form an opinion on this. That is a different matter entirely. However, there is a difference between a bull market and an almost purely speculative bubble.

Holy crap, $19 transaction. Good to know!
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:10:00
This market is an unprecedented one and so there's no predicting what might happen to it. But this current level of price is being driven by speculation, which would have been fine if these newcomers were able to capitalize on the network effect of Bitcoin and find out it's value by transacting on it. 
But that is simply not possible with fees soaring and no short term solution in sight, which is my concern. I am not advocating for sped up development, because that is how egregious mistakes are made. But a long hard look needs to be taken at all of the uneducated and speculative investors rolling in who have either no desire or no means in finding value in the Bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:23:53
Can you explain how much SegWit is saving you in fees? I'm using a segwit wallet am not seeing any saving on fees when trying to transfer to another segwit address. I set a transaction to 30sat/byte and its been stuck for a day now.

The answer to problems isn't "we'll deal with it later"
And there is no minimum tx fee, I can send a 0sat/byte tx right now if I want. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:32:41
Would you happen to know a good way to somehow quantitatively assess how SegWit users save on fees? I'm trying to wrap my head around how I can do so. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:42:43
1-2 hops is trivial. An implementation like that has been around for over a year. There are still a ways to go and Bitcoin is hitting critical mass in terms of usage. Would you be using Reddit if all you could do was create an account and wait a whole year for the platform to scale enough for you to make posts? Or would you move onto a platform that already lets you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:24:05
You can store messages in hash values on the block chain, I believe. It probably wouldn't be a good idea to transmit private messages though
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:44:51
Can you share how to save on fees using segwit? I am using samourai wallet with a segwit address and the "low priority fee" is 350sat/byte, or around $11. If I sent something like 30sat/byte its probably going to get stuck in the pool, no?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:58:37
What is my price per byte paying for? I thought it was per byte of my transaction

These two statements contradict each other.
From the whitepaper:


Your claim of how SPV works:


If the SPV node gets a block from a malicious chain, it will verify the header and accept it as fact, without checking transactions.

@_date: 2017-12-14 03:52:23
I am absolutely not a fan of rushing any sort of development and am glad Lightning is taking as long as it is. What I'm concerned about is that the current price is not driven by the network's abilities but on pure speculation of price. There will be a tipping point for speculators once the inability to transact on the network becomes unbearable.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:21:17
Do you remember the sat/byte and total BTC amount?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:27:04
I understand Segwit coins can launch their own LN, I don't see what that has to do with anything.
Please explain how extremely large block sizes that require massive amounts of storage, bandwidth, and processing power don't prevent more and more people from running nodes that let them verify transactions for themselves. I'm not saying an 8MB block size is an issue, but it will inevitably be one down the road.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:42:01
Can you explain the logic behind this? Why can't people be aware of a bubble existing?

I'm streaming my rent every second. But then I gamble all my Bitcoin away. My landlord is now out half a month's rent because I'm an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:45:46
You hit a roadblock there - merchants are dropping Bitcoin because transactions are broken. I know how the network effect of Bitcoin works, but there is no network if all anybody is doing is buying coins and holding them on exchanges.  If all that is supporting the network is, "Buy Bitcoin because the price is going up" instead of "Buy Bitcoin because of the opportunities the technology presents and its ability to transact peer-to-peer at a global level", then there is very little ground to stand on here.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:07:33
I use a SegWit wallet - at most, you're looking at a 40% drop. That still brings you to a fee of at least $5. Better, yes, still not sustainable.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:49:23
This person has a very poor understanding of how the Lightning Network works and should be stopped from spreading misinformation. There are no "altcoins" or "IOUs" being used in the Lightning Network - real Bitcoins are used. The Network is open source and still requires consensus to deploy and develop so I fail to see how it can be developed to be anymore "government-friendly" than the Bitcoin protocol itself. She also seems to imply that "fractional banking" is an inevitability, when that is simply not possible if all the network is using is HLT and multisig to transact payments.
Furthermore, she says that Bitcoin Cash's approach is just as friendly to decentralization to Bitcoin Core's without acknowledging the concern that extreme block sizes increases can and probably will lead to the reduction of decentralization by further pricing out nodes and miners. She says "you need the exact same resources to mine one or the other", when down the road, this might not be true.
She also says "the Lightning Network is a private network and you have to pay fees to private companies". This is simply not true - anybody can run a lightning node and the fee market for the network is open. Any transaction fees will be pressured downwards to the point where they will be negligible because the cost to run a LN node is negligible.

@_date: 2017-11-27 15:20:38
The only way to do this is by either increasing block size (which essentially what BCH is) or reducing transaction size, which Segwit attempts to do, but there don't seem to be any further improvements available. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:02:31
Will it really need a hard fork? Can you explain why that is?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:49:48
What if A, C, D, and let's say thousands of others are all connected only through B? Even for small transactions, B will still need lots of funds to get everybody's money through. Ideally there will be enough alternate routes such that this centralization doesn't happen, but its still a realistic possibility.

There are no transfer fees if you're transferring BTC to a wallet from GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:15:23
Can you explain how this will impact miner profitability? My interpretation is: blocks aren't being produced fast enough, difficult will drop, so miners can mine more transactions and continue to receive lowered transaction fees at a faster rate? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:23:50
Where can I find a list of these?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:30:30
Yea I actually looked into it, it looks like diminishing returns may start to appear when it comes to improving chip technology, which adds to the concern. However, we are still a long way away from even  50% of our energy consumption being renewable, so I'm not sure if relying solely on the progression of renewable energy tech is the ideal route.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:36:18
Buy a Ledger and put some on it. Or create a software wallet and give them the seed (they'll probably want to create a new wallet afterwards). 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:55:01
[Energy consumption does seem to scale with use]( 
And &lt; 25% of the world's energy is currently renewable, so there will be continue to be a significant environmental impact until renewables catch up.

@_date: 2017-11-30 18:51:23
I'm not talking about the issue of trust, as Lightning solves the trust issue through HTL contracts. However, let's say there's an A-B-C connection, A wants to send C 1 bitcoin, but B only has 0.1 bitcoin committed to the network. Doesn't that make B a useless node?

There's an undeniable environmental impact in electricity consumption, as renewable energy is only &lt; 25% of all energy consumption. For example,[ "For every hour, the bitcoin mine emits at least the carbon dioxide equivalent of more than 203,000 car kilometers traveled."](
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:06:39
The fact that it may represent backing is true, but it may also speak to the inefficiency of Bitcoin mining. Power costs don't seem to be fundamental to Bitcoin's value, which is censorship resistance and decentralization. 
Hypothetically, if an ideologically equivalent coin were to be made that had 0 power costs, and it gained a market cap equal to Bitcoin's, would Bitcoin's backing hold more value because there are power costs?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:43:41
What's the argument behind this? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:03:52
~94% of all coins will be mined by 2024 so the problem will still stand - bitcoin rewards are logarithmically decreasing. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:11:23
I can see how the processes that are currently in place are collectively using more energy. However, my concern is that we are potentially decades/centuries away from crypto/Bitcoin replacing the current societal infrastructure, and until that happens, Bitcoin's energy consumption will continue exponentially growing and existing alongside current infrastructure, which can cause problems. That is why I'm curious if there are any options in incrementally improving environmental efficiency.
