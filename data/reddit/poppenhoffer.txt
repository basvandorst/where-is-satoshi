I bought $500 yesterday at $3980. Already seen like $30 come in. Not unimpressed so far but I'm waiting for the bubble to burst.
Might go ahead and dump a lot of money into ethereum too cause it's on the rise.

Umm, that means "hold onto it" right? Something like that?

Seriously. Wondering when the hype is gonna lead to a big loss. I'll probably just buy even more when the price dips hard so I can laugh maniacally when it inevitably shoots up again.

Isn't this is just trying to drive BTC up because the nature of BTC's value is basically just how hyped it is?
Cause if so, he definitely should've said $30k. Gimme dat MONEY

Can you please ELI5 what a "correction" is? The gist of it that I get is that it's a big fluctuation after an ATH before the price jumps back up to a new ATH.
Also, because the transactional process takes 3-7 days on coinbase, am I "locked in" to seek at the price when I click the "sell" button or the price of btc at the actual time of sale a few days down the line? I know that it's the former for buying, but I'm not sure about selling.

Please also help us newbs when we ask dumb questions! I myself have only heard about it from headlines and kick myself for not buying even a week ago. It's been really fun investing $600 in crypto so far though.
How do people feel about LTC? It's really stable rn, but does anyone think it's poised for another jump?

Any guesstimate as to how low it'll go when it finally does decide to crash? I've heard $2200-$3k.

Three questions:
If I linked my Copay app to Coinbase, when I transfer my btc there is it truly safe if they're linked? And I transfer it by using the "send" option on much account to send it to the email linked to my wallet, right?
And if I bought btc at a given price that I'm locked in at, then decide to sell at a higher price, am I also locked in to sell at the price at the time I hit "sell" or rather the price of btc when the transaction finally clears in a few days?

Thanks! Hopefully I made a good choice to invest at $3980. If it dips below $4k again I'll buy some more for sure.

HELLZ YEAH

So I’m looking at GDAX and can someone please tell me if I’m reading this right??
There’s a very large sell wall going up to $10k, but afterwards there’s a very smooth pleateau. Does that mean that once it hits $10k, it goes straight to the moon? That’s to say, I got in at $4k, so should I now put more in at $9.7k in anticipation of it skyrocketing after $10k?

Fellow noob here. Didn’t understand a word of this. Sorry.
