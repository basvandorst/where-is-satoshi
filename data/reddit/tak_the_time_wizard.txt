I want a tldr explanation

Bitcoin wins everytime. All you have to do is sign it as "Bitcoin" at the end of the message. Same way they hacked enigma in World war 2.
@_date: 2018-05-15 22:40:03
seems to test the time barrier just as well

Is this not simply false advertising?
Why is this so hard to fight?
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:39:06
How do I enter the market without owning anything?
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:15:37
That's the real question
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:24:20
This is really the future. Converting the failed decimal based USA system into a more yen\-like state.

This is the basement if I'm correct again.

@_date: 2018-06-14 23:01:09
and quantumly
@_date: 2018-06-17 14:16:51


@_date: 2018-06-17 16:41:31
now we just need quantum pixels and atomic sized satoshi

"Money accepted in market", we are really running out of headlines,
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:44:19
I sure hope so.
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:12:38
it has a yo-yo feel to it
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:57:11
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:56:26
this was years ago
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:41:37
I did it. I await retribution.
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:46:46
Perfect. Money that can never be touched.
Makes my calculus easier when I have limiters to derive my fortune from.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:23:46
Bitcoin cash is kept track of on the bitcoin public ledger since the public ledger defines all other ledgers. Think of BCH as off ledger bullshit that the ledger still counts because bullshit is a legal form of fertilizer.
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:04:55
By destroy , I meant destroying the seed also. This money is gone forever as far as I am concerned.
Need to hide the rainbow, sort of .
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:42:26
over time isn't that exponential?

I mean we gotta get them off the oil Tit first. then we can transform them into true crypto keepers
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:41:45
Way to difficult, will never catch one, is it even backed by the fed?
Not real money, fake news, bitcoin isn't real,
denial, etc.
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:39:56
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:05:28
it's called market manipulation. If I know no one will ever find it, then I know it will always work towards finding it
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:42:09
still here

An honest market is a naive market.

It is nice to know I have back up on this RAID idea to exponentially increase the value of bitcoin, can I get a 3rd amen on destroyed bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:58:55
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:40:55
OH, nothing. Sweet
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:59:13
You're like 33% correct.

@_date: 2018-04-29 01:42:17
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:42:17
Sure, but at least I know for a fact where some I deleted are going to be forever.
