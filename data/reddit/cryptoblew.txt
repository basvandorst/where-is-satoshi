Bitcoin is not a bubble, you can't place a asset that doesn't have intrinsic value as being overvalued. BTC--&gt;100k!
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:13:39
Simply put, you cannot apply logic to an illogical asset. Past results don't mean anything for future results, especially in the case of cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:53:36
 haha watch it at half speed..
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:39:28
possible but it should rebound based on the power of the underlying and realm of blockchain possibilities.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:54:01
This is why if you believe in blockchain and you believe in what it aims to do, you simply laugh it off as it's your 'retirement account' and you know in 5 years, it will be a million dollars per BTC regardless of what happens in the short-term. As a result, you never sell more than 5% of your position and you only ever do that to take a little bit of profits.

I can see that, that is a macro analysis of everything put together lol. However, nothing is guaranteed or favored. and that is the point of the video
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:35:08
LOL this is awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:10:17
This would be the real battle, but its possible they can work and conicide with each other given blockchain has a variety of different uses.

To get straight to the point of critics, Start at 4:12 seconds

For those who want protection or hedges against crashes, cloud mining may help:

Interactive Brokers (Largest US brokerage firm by volume) aren't allowing shorting, could be a great thing for futures coming up!

Don't do STOP LOSSES with Bitcoin, Volatility will be present in pioneering markets such as cryptocurrency. I elaborate in this video:
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:29:10
That's great to hear man, I've noticed it also, big psychological number for alot of people.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:48:38
Yes, exactly, obviously hopefully 20k rather than a bear market for the short term. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:16:35
Good point, also hedging for miners as well.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:48:01
If scalaing is fixed, which is a matter of when not a matter of IF, blockchain technology will become wide-scale adopted outside of crypto
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:21:26
You reply with this, read this and then get back to me:
If they can't understand it, then tell them to stfu and tell them not to talk shit about something they dont understand.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:38:46
Definitely an option, especially if you are delta hedging. But i'm not in it for the short-term for trading, but with volatility there are of course opportunities there.
In addition, straddling you run risk if market is stagnant and vega takes over (time decay) and since we aren't dealing with options here, it won't even matter since its just futures contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:59:46
Might be 20k by the end of the year, depending on how institutional investors play the futures market December 18th (either bet up or down in their contracts)
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:04:39
This. lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:34:50
obviously, but for every short position, creates FUD, this is what happens to traditional futures markets relevant to the underlying asset, even ones that are cash-settled contracts. So it does make a huge difference.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:36:47
I don't think many people understand how bitcoin work, especially the critics, nor do most people understand how federal reserve system works either.
If your interested in a vid that exposes all critics-&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:56:18
whats your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:08:11
This is precisely the reason why I have a seperate allocation invested for the long term based on the fundamentals of the asset (technology and team) and I don't sell, period.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:17:23
That is true, but those are the small $, institutional investors will dictate alot of short-term movement after 
dec 18...
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:57:48
Dont worry about Bitcoin Futures----&gt; IB not allowing clients to short. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:16:14
Honestly, absolutely no idea generally Alts are negatively correlated with BTC, but with such a monumental event, no idea. With that though, I am bullish on Eth for the Long-term, LTC not so much considering their fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:23:34
Yes, true statement, unfortunately easier said than done.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:46:51
LOL, nice find!
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:26:36
Yes, I agree that is the million dollar question. But wouldn't you expect an asset to continue growing in value if it's something you believe in? For example, you can't compare it to gold in this regard since the price of bitcoin is correlated with the amount of $ in cryptocurrency. So it will rise and fall based on the money in crpyto as a whole rather than stay relatively stationary for gold as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:21:41
Don't worry so much about the short-term fluctuations, if you believe in the technology you should invest, bitcoin has more demand for buying than selling.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:09:14
11K!! I got Bitcoin at various levels and also diversified with cloud mining, check out this video to see profitability and sustainability :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:49:34
Correct, people will start selling the price will come back down, but for long-term holdings, demand could exceed supply if blockchain technology is here to stay which should considering its an improvement from existing technologies. In the short-term buyers are waiting for the price to drop and there are many waiting at every level, which is why with every drop, price continues rising to new highs.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:03:55
its not a bubble because it has no intrinsic value, the biggest difference from now compared to Dot-Com is the fact that companies are overvalued based on their balance sheets.
Since there is no intrinsic value, the value is rather what we perceive at this point, which is purely speculative. Essentially one BTC could be worth 5$, 500$, 5000$, 50,000$, etc it just depends on main stream adoption. 
Check out this video for more information on why its not a bubble:
