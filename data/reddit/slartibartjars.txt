I expect that coin will go to many times the market cap of Bitcoin.
It is aimed at a specific market. Bank to bank and SME to SME transactions. 
This is a huge market, many many trillions of dollars.
SME and Banks will much prefer dealing with a centralised coin, they just do not or are not ready to make the leap to trust their transaction systems to a decentralised system.
Bitcoin is going to globally service the transactions of everyday people which is a large market, but I suspect it will never become adopted for transactions between banks fin and SME.
If the swift system and other systems are replaced by blockchain technology even if it is centralised it promises to introduce huge efficiency gains. Some of these gains will be passed on to the consumer.

I love Bitcoin and personally prefer it over all other crypto.
However, I am also pragmatic and realise that Bitcoin is not going to be a universal solution for everything. 
It has a certain market that it will fill, giving the public the ability to debank.
There are much larger markets that Bitcoin will not fill, mainly because if it does it basically means the end of those institutions.
The banks are not going to just go away. They will streamline their services using a centralised pre-mined blockchain technology. Whether you like it or not, despite it being an inferior product to bitcoin, the service this new technology will provide will satisfy a decent proportion of bank's current customers. It will likely take many decades as the older generations die out.

There will probably be interest from post-keynesian economists as well over time. 
Money is not handled at all well in economics. It is basically exogenous to all mainstream theories. Post-Keynesian economics at least makes an attempt to incorporate money as an endogenous part of the economy.
Money matters, how it is formed and how it behaves makes a real difference to the economy. 
Cryptocurrency and Post-Keynesian economics are made for each other.
Libertarians, not so much. Mostly an extreme ideology. Never good.

The banks and finance in general has become a parasite on the global economy in the last several decades.
Their actions lead to the GFC and what has happened since is those same financial institutions which caused the mess have not only been bailed out but in the 10 years since have been given free money by central banks worldwide in order to keep them going.
This has resulted in zero or close to zero interest rates for most of the world which took away the ability of most ordinary people who rely on term deposits and interest rates to maintain their standard of living to continue to do so. Instead money is being sucked out of 'main street' and pumped into 'wall street' at an incredible rate of knots.
People are not stupid, they can sense what is happening.
Cryptocurrencies are a natural reaction to a world of zero interest rates where banks are not only not allowed to fail but must survive even at the cost of 'main street'.

These guys are the classic case of privatising profits and socialising losses.

Farmers are like every other business, they will succeed long term if they plan long term.
You do not see national begging for money to bail out a family who have set up a small business like a Milk Bar and find hard times do you?
Farmers vote for politicians who actively take money away from the less advantaged in society with one hand and with the other hand come begging to the government every time there is a drought.
They also vote for politicians who deny climate change and will do nothing about it and at the same time beg for help from the government to help their climate change vulnerable industry.

The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.
This is what is gradually happening to the US reserve currency.
Over time more and more countries will just be dealing with each other and excluding the US dollar in their dealings.
The dollar will not be overtaken or battled against. The worst thing possible will happen (in the eyes of the US). It will eventually simply be ignored.
There will not be a replacement global reserve currency as the concept is not possible without overwhelming military power and use of power by one country.
Instead we will be left with a world with several strong currencies and several forms of hard money such as gold, bitcoin and some metals.
The US will simply be left sitting on a branch spending money on bullets while the rest of the world gets on with doing business without the threat and disadvantages of a world reserve currency tied to one country.

The Austrians/Libertarians will wake up soon enough that this space is not all about them.

Look, there are parts where I will agree with Jimmy. But in doing that there are other arguments that bitcoin follows that do not follow Austrians or other schools of economics.
My main point is that economics is the worst of all the academic disciplines in terms of bedding down facts.
I have a PhD in economics and am very happy to tell anyone it is not a 'real' academic pursuit. There is still so much to learn. We have no idea if a unifying long term theory is even possible.
We have gone from Keynesian to Neoclassical this century, without much insight really. Who knows what will happen in the next century.

First thing I would say to him is how much would it cost someone in Australia to buy a car in Germany using just gold?

If bitcoin is going to become a global store of value and then a stable means of exchange it needs to take a lot more 'market share' than it has now.
Estimates for Gold market cap are at the 7 to 8 Trillion USD mark.
Bitcoin needs to get up into this range at an absolute minimum.
That is going to take a while, likely another 5 to 10 years and along the way the price will continue to be volatile.
Once the global market share gets to a point where bitcoin is truly a rival to gold that is when the price might stabilise.
Many people think that bitcoin should be a global currency NOW, but that is not possible without it having a decent market share of global 'value'. A lot of fiat/gold/shares have to be converted yet into bitcoin before it becomes a part of the global market of value. Still years away.

There might be a language barrier.
I come from a family of gold miners. The first whatever % of gold you want to guess was found literally on the ground, big nuggets, little nuggets. 
The first gold found was the easiest to find, as time goes on it gets more and more difficult to find. Not sure how much more clearly I can make my point.
Having two groups with strong viewpoints makes no difference for the long term stability of bitcoin.
One will be right and bitcoin will stabilise.
One will be wrong and it will vanish.

The source of much of the demand for crypto currencies will be young people and those in less developed nations.
These are both growth markets. Western youth will be earning big money soon, the great masses of people in less developed nations have a desperate need for the services crypto currencies provide.  
Add on top the demand from ordinary citizens in the western world then you have a situation where the global 'market share' of wealth will be injected into crypto.
This is not going to happen over one or two years. This has still got at least another decade before the market share in crypto pushes out legacy finance.
Things are still very early, it is only when the market share stabilises when prices stabilise.
This whole thing is about a transfer of wealth into a new form of finance.

It is a quick correlation done between the number of daily subscribers to r/bitcoin and the daily price of bitcoin.
Then I did the same calculation where I stepped the days forwards and backwards to see if the correlation changed before and after the price of bitcoin.
The data used was from April 2014 to today.
Only took a few minutes to put together in excel.
If this shows anything it is that movements in the price of bitcoin seems to impact the number of subscribers to r/bitcoin about three to five days later.
Nothing earth shattering, but r/mildyinteresting.

In order for bitcoin to be force globally it needs to take market share away from fiat/shares/gold etc.
This is what is happening now.
Once enough market share is established, it is only THEN that bitcoin can become a true currency.
This is still years away.
The market cap of bitcoin is not much more than $100B USD.
That is tiny in the global marketplace.
Over the next 5 to 10 years bitcoin needs to keep improving and developing, but it also need to keep gaining market share of the global pool of 'value'.
This is a shift in global finance.
A shift does not happen with tiny market cap.
This is global finance we are talking about. A LOT more money/gold/shares need to be converted into bitcoin before it can become a global player.
In summary: Bitcoin is not even close to a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:40:47
Thousands of years ago people were picking gold off the ground. That is just common sense.
The easiest mining happens first.
There are two possibilities for bitcoin, one complete failure, two complete success. There really is no middle ground for this type of technology.
It is never going to work as a half-currency  or half-store-of-value it has to work as something at least equivalent in the world economy as gold or it will not work.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:24:30
Exactly. In the end it all comes down to trust.
A lot of things need to happen.
Bitcoin needs to be all the things many have talked about. But it needs something else.
Over time the more fiat/gold/shares that are converted into bitcoin and increasing market share the more trust will be built, despite volatility.
Bitcoin needs to keep developing as software though, so far the quality of devs and the the community of miners and nodes indicate to me that things are OK.
Biggest risk is the devs/miners/nodes community not keeping up with expectations.
Personally I am hoping that anything approaching mainstream 'awareness' is still at least 3 or 4 years away.
Gold is very ingrained over thousands of years, but you have to remember, gold was once a new technology and in the initial stages thousands of years ago you could literally just pick it up off the ground. Over a long time it became wanted and over that time it became more and more scarce (have to start digging for it). Sound familiar.

I am not a mainstream economist though. 
I actually think that money is important. Neoclassical economists (the vast majority and hive mind for decades) think that money does not matter and it is exogenous in their models.
Yes, money is not considered important by mainstream economists to how an economy operates.

Still a long way off. Very much still in the early adoption phase.
Things will not get stable until there is an ocean of input. When the market finds bitcoins true 'market share' of global capital is when price will begin to stabilise.
This is years away.
How many trillions in terms of market share is the final figure is anyone's guess. Traditional money markets will not vanish in our lifetimes, too many HODLers for the old system (mostly older generations).
Bitcoin will take some share of the global market but it will not be near 100%. But it will eventually be substantial and big enough eventually to make it a viable currency for that proportion of global investment.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:22:32
Probably after at least another five years of development you will find a few dozen nations adopt bitcoin as their national currency (mostly the poorest nations). Which will cause massive change in the world economy.
The cost-benefit of keeping a national currency or switching to bitcoin will become too great for many of the poorer nations.
The true growth market for bitcoin initially is first world millennials and third world countries.

"Market Cap"
Purely a function of fiat converted to bitcoin.
If BTC = 10k now.
It represents a % of fiat converted to BTC.
(very small % at the moment)
If BTC gets up to 100k and 1000k per bitcoin then you can say a decent percentage of fiat has been swapped for BTC.
But even at those prices BTC would have captured a small percentage of global finance.
Best case scenario for BTC is it captures a nominal 'majority' of the  global finance system (it will NEVER take over).
Even with a small majority BTC would be at levels unthinkable today.
Still at least five years away though.
