Yes, mathematically guaranteed. And that's why gold is more expensive, in worthless fiat, than it was 5 years ago.

With Lightning, the need for actual Bitcoin transactions will approach zero :)
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:38:51


True. While the price of gold has fallen; not merely in buying power, but fallen in relation to USD. The buying power of which, as you've so correctly pointed out, also fell. 
Amazing fail :[

To my knowledge, I haven't opined on Bitcoin scaling in this thread. If *P2P Cash* doesn't scale, it doesn't scale. No need to be upset with me.

Jeesh you're easily spooked! Lightning is vaporware, we won't even have SegWit, judging by how things are going. 
Man up, Buttercup!

Tsar Nicholas said something similar to the reds. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:33:28
Well, it's not when you consider what miners get paid for processing those transactions, which is (12.5 BTC per block) * ($681 per BTC) / [1,625 transactions per block]( =~ $5.24 per transaction. Plus $.18 fee :(
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:25:04


Correct, and why "approach zero" rather than zero. Each human would need to transact on-chain twice. 
At least for awhile, until humans catch on to the fact that Bitcoin is as essential to transacting in Lightning as physical gold is to transacting in USD. And then a few ninja code edits, and goodbye ~~gold~~ Bitcoin standard.

Can confirm story, am one of the 10 people OP speaks of. CCMF!
@_date: 2016-10-27 11:53:04
Update: $.13 recommended transaction fee. 35 or so college students (21-23 years old) now owe you money.
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:52:07


Irrelevant. In my example, the USD is still twice as expensive to spend today as it was yesterday, regardless of its price. Because 1 penny (what it cost me yesterday to spend a dollar) is 1/100th of a dollar, and 2 pennies (what it costs today) are 1/50th. Because math.


It is. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:47:57
No OP. And that's why, before there was Bitcoin, no one ever sent money overseas. But now they can. With Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:17:43


Anyone ever say "yes" to that?
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:55:19
Dunno why people are even bothering with Lightning. We already have Bitcoin debit cards, which can handle "2015 holiday season volume spikes of 600 transactions per second." Using those is as much like actually using Bitcoin as Lightning would be.

I'm quoting  verbatim. And linking to my source. So no, I'm not "posting irrelevant arguments," merely stating verifiable facts. 
If you feel that  is misleading, drop them a line. 
Finally, unless  changes its methodology from day to day, the cost of sending Bitcoin is, indeed, increasing.

Have you followed the link? Which part of

It's not that $.18 is bad (though rules out sub-$5 purchases, which are the most common ones), but that it's going up at ridiculous rate. it was $.07 a few weeks ago, $.13 yesterday, and now $.18 :(

How so? If it costs me $.01 yesterday to spend $1, and today it costs $.02, how does USD price play into this?

Thanks for failing to clear up that misunderstanding. At least now I know that I'm wrong and you're right.
@_date: 2016-10-27 13:48:46


Absolutely. I can choose to pay nothing. My transaction will never get confirmed, but why get lost in irrelevant details? 


And that's why I don't buy coffee with PayPal &amp; use cash instead.

. . .


So almost a dime each. Not bad!
Minus the [$.09 recommended transaction fee]( . . . makes it just a bit less than a penny each :(
@_date: 2016-10-27 11:27:29
No need to be upset just because gold turned out to be a shittier "investment" than keeping USD stuffed in a mattress. And silver... ooooeee! :D
