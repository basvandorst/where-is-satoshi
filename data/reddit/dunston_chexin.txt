Nvm, I read your comment too fast. That 2017 column could actually come true somewhat easily. It would pretty much happen if we never dip below the top of the old log channel.

You’re my hodl spiritual leader. Especially with yolotrades mostly gone.

If 10-100 and 100-1m are easier than 1-10, does that imply each will be done in less than a year? Since 1-10 took a year?
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:04:48
So what’s your non conservative estimate then?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:20:00
Any recommended reading or viewing on why not?

If only 5% is necessary, that implies that you don’t think market cap is a useful metric for this?

Didn't even read the OP and thought your chicken coop collective was just some kind of future aristocrat joke

I'm counting on 250x gainz. 1mil / 4K 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:32:36
Your comment made you sound new to the internet. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:17:13
Is this your site? How does it determine the estimate for each milestone? Is it the average of all the timeframes?
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:19:05


I guess. Why not just continue to accumulate though?

Do you just mean withdrawing to coinbase or to a cold wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:50:27
Does this math assume all 21 coins?
I mean 21 million

If a satoshi were one cent, bitcoin would be one million dollars, so you'd need one thousand btc to be a billionaire 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:42:45
So he currently has one 2020 BTC worth of 2017 BTC
