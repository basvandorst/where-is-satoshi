Is this public knowledge or a theory? My question then would be why would I trust my money with an exchange that commits fraud on that scale?

Unfortunately I haven’t used my PayPal account enough to trust it, the last time I sold some things on eBay through PayPal they locked the funds for weeks, I’m not active on eBay at all anymore as I got sick of waiting. They released it eventually but it left a sour taste in my mouth. Since then I’ve read some horror stories about them freezing accounts and booting users for no reason. I just don’t trust them enough...

So I’ve played around with Wirex, it looks good, is intuitive enough, I’ve bought btc and transferred some to a wallet and back again, sold some, *but,* every time I attempt to wire any funds back to my bank it declines. I’ve messaged support to no answer, and digging deeper into them there is someting sketchy going on with their recent ico, and I’m reading stories of account funds going missing etc. 
I really wish this were easier, there are no easy methods to sell without extortionate fees, I’m worried that adoption will be non-existent without an easy means of egress.

Do you feel like it would be easier or harder if you’d just bought in at 10k to hold?

Sounds pretty rough for those that grew up there, are there no opportunities aside from the oil company and I’m guessing but the hospitality set up for it? I’m uk here, the property ladder is beyond my grasp atm but attainable in time I hope!

Thanks I will take a look at those. As for I’ve posted this same question there twice recently and was ignored each time. So I appreciate the responses here all the more.

They were hacked just before I started buying btc so I’ve stayed well away, I may give them another look though.

Would you mind expanding on this point or posting something worth reading with this conclusion, it sounds interesting.

This is just mean, I’m no expert but she obviously does’t know the ramifications of what she’s saying.
Pulling a random blade of the street to mock them isn’t something I’d like to get behind, and it’s the worth form of ‘journalism’ going.

It sounds an awful lot like he’s taking about fiat currency’s since when did the dollar not cause inflation or deflation??
