I don't think it's something to laugh about for them :/.
And they lost likely wouldn't do that if the fees were very low...
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:45:51
I guess it's because they can then send to other coinbase users for free.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:08:21
Yes, but you can withdraw it. Most people don't tho.
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:23:07
I agree totally for anyone with no money issues, except here it's Venezuela, where they are mostly very poor, so even a low priority fee is a lot when it's for a very small transaction. And then there is also the times when the fees are high for a prolonged period. If you actually use it to buy food, you can't just wait.
This would have been pretty fun if it was in the US for instence because then as you said it would have just been because of greed and taught people a valuable lesson. But here it's just a lesson, once again, about the scaling issues. Hopefully they'll soon be able to use lightning or whatever other solution.

This deserves a goodbye in proportion, I really hope it will reached the front page of Reddit and maybe give ideas to other.

I'm just waiting for when it will be 50cents -&gt; 50 sats
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:49:24
No, that's a common mistake. It's not that much logarithmic that it won't ever get to 21 million. I think it's in more than 100 years tho, but not by much.

We're under 1 billion in volume ?

Yeah lot's of people recently seems to believe that in a bulletin there is only one ATH and it's the top before the downturn. A bull market is filled with ATH. However he did raised a point, that the ATH was way higher than the previous ATH (before a downturn, so 2014). But it's still easy to say in hindsight. When we passed 10k, following his logic we should have all clearly sold everything.

It's true, however you have to agree that the title is a complete lie. It serves no one to lie about those things.

It seems to also be pushing people to get rid of any cash and have only the "e-currency", which I guess would be strictly monitored...
@_date: 2019-02-06 06:27:02
You mean "Nah".
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:11:18
Oh yeah my bad. Well thanks for the info.
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:11:30
The problem with this is that it means that if you want a "vote", you need to deposit your Bitcoin on said exchange. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
I still find it to be a good tool to get a "feel" of the opinion, but that's about it. Else it's far from the ideal that Bitcoin is in my mind.

But the famous "January dip"
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:18:55
Maybe if you eat the first 10 apples.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:16:47
Well it depends on what you care about.
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:06:51
Yeah man, I did too. I now have over 100 millions bitcoins !
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:21:51
Yes, how do you know me ? I'm satoshy, inventor of bytcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:09:19
Ok, I think you got the title of approved correction based joke. Well played.
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:41:26
Did I heard faucets ?
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:14:18
Yeah I know some obviously will, but imo I don't see much to argue about that when the time comes. But obviously I'm sure the community will prove me wrong..
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:11:50
Well can't tell you why op linked about it (and haven't watched the video actually, but if it talk about the sell from mtgox it is kind of related as if they are selling bch is just because they are selling BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:54:12
And that Chinese New year !
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:40:08
Yes, but who would say no to that ? It should be a no controversial hardfork.
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:00:54
On some exchanges (like binance) they use the ticker BCC for BCH

It's my moon now.
