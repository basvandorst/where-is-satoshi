Possible. 


Not feasible with current computing power. 


Not beyond shadow of some doubt. Anyone can become expert on bitcoin. It's stupidly simple how bitcoin works consider how big it is. Also as I said if Satoshi the person or group moved some coins from their wallet, it could be Satoshi. Or it could be a person who forced Satoshi the person or group to hand over their private keys. Or they might have stumbled upon the keys. All of this is possible. It's possible for you to win the Powerball without ever even buying a ticket. Unlikely but still possible.

I use credit card for everything. Points. Plus, it's not really "my" money being spent. If I use my bank or ATM card, my money is gone right away.  What if I don't receive the goods/services? I'll be on the hook. But with credit card, I'll still be on the hook to pay the credit card if I don't receive goods/services. But I can use credit card company to go after the merchant who failed to hold up their end of the bargain.

That's absolutely true. It gets easier.

It seems like the bitcoin core developers are not saying or doing anything. We know for a fact that bitcoin has too high of a fee and we know for a fact that it takes forever to confirm a transaction. Why won't they just announce something, anything for the benefit of all of bitcoin and bitcoiners? This seems so wrong for them to just not be doing something. I know they are working on LN and other sidechain solution. But why not go with easier fix like bigger blocks. Just because we didn't get s2x doesn't mean we cannot get better and newer version of s2x.

I am not buying anymore because I don't want to invest more than I can bear to lose. Because of that I watched the price drop with amusement. And wished I could buy some more. Never panicked. I ain't doing shit until next havening.

What do you mean they cannot push segwit adoption? I am pushing for segwit adoption even. I emailed coinbase/gdax. I talked my friends into using Trezor. I'm doing my part in pushing it. Why can't core developers do what I am dong. I know for a fact that they will reach countless millions of people like they reached many with their no2x campaign. 
They cannot simply hope for adoption. They must promote and push its adoption.

Oh great, more bankers getting into bitcoin. This is definitely not good for bitcoin. Now big, big money  are going to bet against bitcoin and do everything to make their bet win. But this cannot be stopped. Sometimes I feel like bitcoin will always remain a cypherpunk experiment and never will become a mainstream global currency.

Same here. I'd sacrifice some of my btc for the benefit of the network and humanity. I ain't a greedy fuck like roger ver or people.

You are extremely fortunate. However your anecdotal fortunate experiences aren't indicative of nearly trillions of transaction that take place every year and a quite a few of those end up in disputes.

That's very unreasonable. I can make my changes and I hard-fork it and put it out there. But it's very unlikely millions of people are going to use my forked bitcoin. I'm absolutely an unknown person. Nor do I have the wealth of Roger Ver to promote/market my alt-coins. The experts or the current defacto developers need to do something. They need to announce that they have started working on bigger blocks. They actually need to work on bigger blocks. They need to continue their works on LN as well. Bigger blocks + segwit  + LN = bitcoin unstoppable. Unfortunately me and you and just a random average coder can't find enough consensuses. The core developers can. When the world opposed s2x, they listened to the core developers. They will listen to them now. Especially now that we all know bitcoin has high fee and terrible confirmation time. 
I'm sure core devs read If you guys are reading this, please, please do something. Or else we risk altcoin like bch taking over. And those of us who sold our bch right after the fork or those of us who came into bitcoin after the fork (millions), we are going to lose a lot of money. Find it in the goodness of your heart to do your best. You are after all the core of bitcoin.

Aside from the conf time and high-ish fee (which will be resolved in few months, IMO), why would I use ETH over BTC? Why would I use anything over BTC? Not just ETH. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:12:53
How do we know which is his wallet? Assume that we do. And someone moves coin from the wallet. But how do we that someone didn't stumbled upon his private key or stole them or something? So no, not even Satoshi can prove that he's Satoshi any longer. Such is bitcoin. And no other coin can come close to this. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:38:04
The core developers aren't infallible. Yes, they are great for making great contribution and I and we appreciate it. But we aren't dump fucks either. Yeah, maybe not all of us can write c++ code or python code, but we aren't dump for not having mastered coding. But we do have combined life experience of millions of years. And we see the problems... high fee and long confirmation time. And we see bcash and others having solved it quite easily and quickly. Why can't our suggestion be also included? 
Robert Ebert doesn't make movie himself. He doesn't need to to be a critic of movies. Nor do we have to be bitcoin coders to criticize bitcoin and suggest solutions.

I agree with simply block-size increase we go back to the same problem again once that block-size is fully utilized. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't use this solution ever. We cannot increase block-size to 1gb. But we sure as hell can increase it to 16mb or even 32mb and be okay for few years. And this few years allows us time to  develop LN and other solution. So hopefully we won't encounter this situation ever again. Right now we are being choked to death. If bitcoin falls behind bcash, I fear there won't be any recovering from it. It would be a huge psychological defeat. And guess what if bcash adopts LN, it would be certain death for bitcoin. We need real tangible solution right now. The core devs need to go for big blocks now and push for more segwit adoption and work on LN as well. If they cannot then we will lose out in the end.

Bitcoin also doesn't have a known creator. I mean a known person or group. All other shitcoin has creator/ceo, etc. Not bitcoin. Even Satoshi will have  hard time proving he's Satoshi.

Sock-puppet what exactly? I'm not making up the fact that bitcoin has high fee nor am I making up the fact that it takes long time to confirm. While you will never know for certain if I'm sock-puppet or not, but I'm 100% certain that you hold bitcoin and you want to bury your head in the sand. Well, no. You want us to bury our head the sand. You might be okay with losing lots of money. I am not. I came into bitcoin after the fork. So no, I didn't get free bcash. Nor am I converting my btc to bcash. Not yet at least. I'll lose out a lot if bcash takes over and bitcoin stagnates. Let's not bury our head in the sand. Let's talk about the issues we have and help build consensus into solving those issues.

So far I heard they are closing only business accounts. Not personal accounts. Everyone should get alt accounts for coinbase and other crypto related things, IMO. Some banks are even doing sigh up bonus... more moolah for more cryptos.

There is absolutely a "they". And they are here  and they have names and even pictures posted of them. They might not control bitcoin in totality. But they have incredible amount of influence and sway into what is bitcoin and what goes into bitcoin. They are after all called bitcoin **CORE** developers. 
Some people have forked bitcoin with bigger blocks. They are called bcash. I guess as a person I need to decide if I am gonna stick with bitcoin or move over to bitcoin cash. I have a lot of emotional attachment with bitcoin. Years of attachment. I can't just willy nilly move to bcash. But at the same time we are all in this to make money. And I cannot wait and see bitcoin drop in market share, price, while bcash gain. I like millions of others are in a difficult position. We don't need to be. All we need is core to say everyone must adopt segwit and that they are working on bigger blocks to solve fee and confirmation time. The world listened to them even though they aren't absolute master of bitcoin. We rejected s2x. Now we will listen to them if they announce better s2x. And we will listen to them once they hurriedly release LN. Well not really release but push for mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:55:57
But we control it. We want to make it transact again. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:47:16
Yes. The issue hasn't solved permanently. But for the time being some of the altcoin like bcash have stupid cheap transaction fee and really fast confirmation time. That will last for them for next couple of years. But when will this be the case for bitcoin?

All those pay new site should switch to LN payment. There as been so many times I click away from those sites becaue they want me to make an account, fill out my personal info, fill out credit card. I don't want to give my personal info to one more company. And I don't want to sit through the process of filing out my info, then verifying my email, and all that shit. 
I just want to read the fucking article. Ask me to pay you reasonable number of sats to read just that article. Like the demo LN thing where. You read first paragraph, the click read further. Then an LN invoice QR was presented. You paid and instantly the whole article was readable. 
Same for music and books and softwares and movies. I want the damn movie. I don't want to give you my fucking SSN and blood sample. I want to pay you reasonable amount of satoshi. 
If more and more bitcoin/LN app make this effort to make reading, listening, watching things online convenient, instant, and easy, the future for bitcoin and LN is bright.

And that's why I keep sticking with one merchant which already has all the info from me. I would love to not shop from this merchant ever again. I'd rather buy from smaller merchants. But I'm too lazy to enter all my info again and keep track of one more password/login combo. With BTC.LN I don't have to. Sure I'd need to enter and shipping address. But I can deal with that.
