Do you know if it costs a transaction fee to move a balance on a ledger from classic to segwit?

No you can just withdraw it back to the bank account for free. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:20:25
All good. I had a feeling that would be the case but wasn't 100% sure if they didn't have some sort of exception for transactions like that.

Why will waiting prevent you from selling it?

I've no idea but there's a green box instead of orange so that's a good sign either way.

I only got in around the end of August so no, I didn't learn anything from BCH and why I was asking for an answer here 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:38:45
Talk over at r BTC looks like they're keen to get BCH going full speed as a contender in hopes that miners will focus on that instead of core.

Oh wait! I was around for that, it's the Bitcoin Cash I wasn't around for.     Gold fork was a couple of weeks ago but it's all still weird &amp; nothing's really been announced of what we are to do about claiming it.

Ledger put up an announcement about this yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:17:51
It'll get back to this price even if it does drop. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:28:36
How do you know what their effort level is?  They could be working flat out and the problem could require more work / time than you would like it to take. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:49:05
Yes. It's not been announced HOW to do this yet, but Ledger will post details ASAP after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:40:16
You ever suck dick for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:44:19
That's all fair but you mentioned their lack of effort in your OP. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:48:19
From what I've read on here it doesn't seem like a good idea to keep your stuff there. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:27:21
As soon as I read about one.

Yeah that's right,  if you want to use both OG bitcoin and S2X you will be able to split it with their instructions once they announce it's safe to do so.

There's a new one I just found thanks to the bitcoin ticker app.  acx.io   . I haven't looked into their prices yet but could be worth checking out to see if they're competitive.

If you're buying it to make a quick buck, that could go either way, but if you're in it for the long haul then it doesn't matter so much. It could still go either way of course, but it's more likely to see a better price over a longer period of time.

From IMDB "Miami - A desperate banker needs to conceal stolen money. A Haitian-American gang lord wants to go legit. A Cuban-American hacker has an idea that will revolutionize the very future of money itself. Forced to work together, they unwittingly create their version of the American dream - organized crime 2.0."
Does bitcoin feature in it?

Thanks for that link, I've been lurking around here for about a month and had seen DCA mentioned a few times but hadn't looked it up due to laziness &amp; forgetfulness.

You can use Poli if your bank is compatible. I just upped my limit to $4000 today. It can be increased again but I'm not sure to what value.

Interesting to see what impact it has for users who aren't using it for anything shady.  BTC markets already ask for ID details and Cointree ask for photos already , but maybe there'll be an increase in fees if the exchanges have to pay $$$$ to the government for whatever reason?

@_date: 2017-10-24 01:04:31
I hadn't used coinjar so I can't compare them &amp; wouldn't feel comfortable making a recommendation to switch or not. When I was trying to figure out what to do back in August I read a few comments on here asking about Australian exchanges and cointree had good reviews so I went with them.   
I had no issues with the sign up, processing times, rates or fees though and didn't switch over for anything other than that $200 minimum.

I had been using CoinTree when I was putting across some savings I had banked up, but their minimum deposit is $200 and so I've recently  moved across to BTC markets as their minimum is $10 so I can do smaller exchanges each week. 
(Most of my weekly pay savings are going to my wedding so unable to put aside $200 a week but don't want to wait a few weeks to build up that balance, what with the price increases lately). 
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:35:24
Maybe 
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:12:07
It comes in a box but there's actually a card inside that points out there's no security seal because they don't need one.  When you plug it in and set it up it runs check and makes sure it's not been compromised. So even if on the off chance something looks funky once you get it, it'll tell you if there's a problem before you get to a point where you can send coins to it.

I just put in a buy this morning but I gotta wait for Monday for the money to clear and I am scared to see what price I'll get by then.

I don't think you're gonna find anywhere that doesn't have fees.  Cointree is a good one.
