Anyone that isn't already interested in bitcoin will just end up spending it on 'stuff'.

The truth is that no one really knows what the true value of a bitcoin is. Does the debt variable that you mentioned affect it's value? Sure. But so does dozens of other economic and competitive variables that could push it's value in the opposite direction. If you have 15 minutes spare, [this video]( goes further into detail in explaining it's valuation.

What the..!!! Why is everyone upvoting this shit? The dude sold the most valuable asset in recent history to buy playstation for lil Jimmy.
Although it's none of my business what others do with their money, if my dad told me 10 years ago that he sold his apple shares to buy me a playstation, I would slap the shit out of him because January's gonna come and we all still gonna be broke

I think that rule generally applies to people that are holding bitcoin as a long term investment. If you are trading regularly then you don't really have a choice but to hold it in an exchange.

That's nice, but extremely unlikely. Given the $250k true valuation, I think we'd be extremely lucky to have it be $100k a decade from now, at which point I would be more than happy to sell all my holding.
Betting on bitcoin's mainstream acceptance surging from an extremely unlikely hyperinflation and political upheaval is like waiting for a zombie apocalypse, it doesn't really help anyone to be throwing those wild numbers around.

Although this is a very simplistic method, the world supply of money is $3.8 trillion using the 'monetary base' as a measure. When this is divided by the fixed number of available bitcoins, 21 million, we arrive at the value of bitcoin being $180k.
But given the inflationary nature of fiat money, it is safe to assume that $250k is the true value of a bitcoin.
I think it is extremely important to be literal and accurate when it comes to things like this, because a scarily large percentage of people on this sub actually expect the bitcoin to raise significantly above this level even though $250k is the best case scenario, which therefore make $100k a target figure for 99% of people investing in bitcoin to be willing to sell at when risk and reward is taken into account.

Wait, how do people come out with those $1m figures? Given the current supply of money, bitcoins true value when divided is $250k, no?
