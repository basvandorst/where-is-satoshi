@_date: 2018-01-23 13:35:18
Why is it that gdax charts says it a low of 9945 at 6:50-6:55 am est on 5m candles? I watched that happen, and it never crossed 10k. Any ideas?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:54:38

@_date: 2017-03-10 17:33:01
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:31:34
I have no idea how to do it
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:24:44
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:12:50
Too many day traders really fucking this up. They close theyre 'positions' at night and we give them back those coins in the morning. Stop selling. Simple as that. They dont care what range they trade in, so theyll be content driving this to anywhere higher than 0.......so why not make them trade at $50k. Theyll nut up and do it if they wanna keep suckling the teet of their TA.

This little pullback seems totally fine to me so long as we can find real buyers here and propel forward. So as long as people dont panic over nothing and stay strong, we can easily move up
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:02:30
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:14:09
Id say given our obvious liquidity problem we do not want this:

Will you eat your own dick live on youtube if you are wrong?
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:56:34
Guees what happens if everyone does that
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:59:03
The solution is to get alot more people who buy and hold and believe in the tech. This idea, while good in theory, would be impossible to implement. The way to make the price go up is to dry up the supply while increasing the demand.

TA is nothing but self fulfilling...i love how everyone using TA is using all the same numbers and everyone can see all the same shit and yet each one of them considers themselves some sort of soothsayer....im excited to see leveraged shorts get rekt. This time its gonna great.

Yeaa he should get nothing....maybe jail...maybe fines for the rest of his life, but def nothing...I had a life changing amount of btc with that fucker and I am going to see essentially nothing from it. That still sucks.
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:55:59
Yeaa otc desks and off market purchases
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:53:21
stop market selling your coins in this environment.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:05:37
Traders didnt help the price increase....FOMO did...and holding did......obviously...cuz if there was more selling than buying it wouldnt have increased...im sorry to be mean. You are not smart.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:15:06
Can u guys stop saying welcome to bitcoin when ppl ask that...we all kno, but its really not an answer to the question
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:07:31
True ull never know but...have faith my son
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:08:13
Yeaaa how the hell does this work
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:04:40
Or the first one....have a downvote
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:09:22
Many of those are bots that are split up to help put walls up there and make psychologically weak individuals panic and think their orders will never fill....they drive price down and then those same ppl buy ur coins cheap....it is smart money, but be careful, many of those never actually sell...watch...ull see em poppoing up and moving when market gets too close
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:51:46
Dont......ive been raw dogged this way before
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:22:53
Does gdax being totally fucked have anything to do with this?
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:14:24
just friends and family it is reasonable to expect ull be fine...the problem is when dealing with ppl you dont know...
And it sometimes happens after days, and you are just stuck. No recourse. They used to say that they dont allow digital currency exchange in their TOS, but now idk...its risky
