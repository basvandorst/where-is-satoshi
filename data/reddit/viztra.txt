Well I don‘t disagree that banks/the government have done shady shit, but there‘s alot more that backs the USD value than just confidence...
I also think that you guys often forget that most people don‘t care at all what they pay with, as long as it‘s easy, practical and cheap.

Yea that's true. Didn't want to bash you or anything, it's good that you told that story although it seems like the shop might've been legit and was just hacked.


Mistakes happen. Don't beat yourself up about that, it's just a single bad experience in your life!

So the website is liitebit.eu, that doesn‘t sound legit at all.
Talking to the ceo is a bigger red flag though. If the ceo is the guy doing sales and email support I wouldn‘t trust them anyway.

So you think only undercapitalized retail investors went long, because they all thought BTC would go to 50k?

Of course it can‘t be uninvented. That isn‘t a guarantee for it to keep increasing in value though, especially as it‘s losing usecases.
Also selling doesn‘t make you an idiot. Sitting out a downtrend until its reversing is quite profitable actually and more importantly exposes you to less risk.

While they all crash together, alts can rise while btc is just going sideways.

Who gets the tethers once they are issued? Bitfinex/Tether themself?

You do know though, that for everyone that bets on the price going lower, there has to be someone taking the other side, right?
Why do you guys here always assume it's just one side. If one side actually wanted to manipulate it in their direction, what makes you think the other side doesn't?
It's actually interesting how many ppl come in here agreeing and complementing this. This might actually be something that you could trade, just because so many blindly agree, like a self-fulfilling prophecy. At the end of the day it doesn't matter that much what actually happens, but just what people believe or want to believe.

There is an equal amount of people going long and short on futures.

It's also backed by the fact that everyone has to pay their taxes in their countries currency. For Americans that means they have to have x% of their income in USD anyway. It's backed by probably the highest adoption of any currency and probably the most powerful country currently.


I don't think mainstream really cares, I don't either, so I'm biased. Of course if people are put on the spot like "do you want something that's better for you or not" they would agree and say yes, but otherwise it requires initiative from them and most people have enough to do with their job and private lives/hobbies to even care.

Do you guys understand a single thing about futures? There are equal amounts of guys on both sides, long and short. No one got hammered anymore than when the price went down. And no one reported about how they made money when the price went down, no one reputable atleast. If you mean reddit posts about how mean wall street cashes in on bitcoin going down, well that's because they don't understand how futures work..
