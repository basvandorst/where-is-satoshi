I absolutely despise this website. Two years ago, I used bitcoins to buy some “movie prop” IDs (hahah that’s how they’re advertised) and the transaction went smoothly, but I used uphold to keep my btc. I left the remainder (a little more than 0.1 btc) in my account since I didn’t need to spend the full amount I bought for the IDs. It was a fraction of what I paid so I didn’t really care at first. Then, bitcoins took off, so I logged into my account to find out how much I really had. At the current market rate, an exchange when I logged in 2 years later would have made me $1200. It doesn’t sound like a lot in the grand scheme of things, but as a 22 year old kid who needs money for textbooks and the occasional night out it’s a big deal. So I logged into my account and found out that 8 months ago, my bitcoins were transferred to a USD wallet at the rate of about $1400, which means I was credited around $200 or whatever for the fraction of bitcoin that was left. Which is UNACCEPTABLE since I didn’t make this transaction, and would never have authorized this. I know the money wasn’t stolen, since it is still in my account and I am still able to transfer the measly $200 into my bank. So I would not ever recommend using this site. When I reached out about it for an explanation (knowing fully well that a refund is probably out of the question) I was met with nothing but silence on their end.
TLDR; uphold.com exchanged my bitcoins for USD without my consent, and without any alert or explanation, screwing me out of over a grand.
