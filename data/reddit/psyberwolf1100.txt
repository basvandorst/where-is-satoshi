Dude, you are donating to such good causes. 
Id like to suggest you might be interested in a conference called EGA held in Australia sometimes.  I went in 2011 and met the couple that started/run erowid and had a one on one chat with them. Also went in 2017 December to EGA  and listened to so many good talks about mdma/psychedelics in therapy, microdosing and how it can help,  man i could go on,  but with what you are supporting i would suggest this may be of interest to you. 
I'm going to donate some to maps after i saw your donation.  Its inspiring.

Which meet was this,  im in ade too!
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:55:38
Sadly its probably not a joke,  ver is common at doing this.

This needs to be posted to @_date: 2017-12-28 00:34:34
You mined bitcoins yet you don't know how to open a wallet.dat. Sounds suss to me. If you had the smarts to mine btc,  opening or using a wallet.dat file isnt anywhere near as hard.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:33:49
Great video,  thanks for posting,  maybe post on r/btc also 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:26
Want to use a bitcoin atm? Well probably only supports bitcoin. 
Want to pay for something that takes bitcoin,  well you can pay with bitcoin,  not bcash.  I don't see "accepting bcash" anywhere,  cause its a shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:47:09
This is excellent. I only just got back from EGA and after hearing all the amazing talks and research that had happened since the last outdoor ega things are definitely on the right track overall in this space with more trials and research happening and showing the world The truth for good/health purpose.  Ill donate Crypto to this,  will look into this a bit more when on my pc 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:27:19
Oh lets just have a device in our house connected to a company that logs everything.  Yeah great idea.... 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:24:40
Yep this year im giving paper wallets! 
@_date: 2015-06-11 10:51:44
Didn't know people still used fiat...
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:58:02
Thanks so much for supporting good causes.  You inspire me to do the same. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:47:32
First i was like "cool idea", than i was like "shit this makes you a target to get your pc robbed".
@_date: 2014-05-22 08:12:55
wow this thread got way bigger than i expected!..

@_date: 2014-08-19 13:06:32
And im just sitting here with my 10gh solving blocks like a pro.   
Payouts are like months these days and for such little btc.,   
But they look cool flashing away in my cabnit.

Met fire and earth at a conference, best moment ever. As you can tell from that letter they are amazing people.
@_date: 2014-04-12 08:59:42
Wonder who will reach the moon first, the doge or the bit....only time will tell. Epic race to the moon.
@_date: 2014-08-02 00:40:15
Dude space them out a bit, leave a slot between each one,  helps so much with heat and looks nicer :). (i run be's on the same hub) 
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:21:00
thus why i dont trade, cause its too risky for me.
although i play with mining cause its fun and i learn more about linux (rpi's)
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:41:17
I think that bitcoin is for the greedy and doge is for the giving and fun. In the few months doge has been around all its done is help the underdoges. The downvotes on this posts show.
@_date: 2014-08-14 06:29:58
Haha, exactly what i said to my work mates. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:21:57
Such promote
Many pictues
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:28:40
I do it to learn about linux as i run it on a pi. I got usb miners cause anything bigger with my power costs would be silly ($.27). 
@_date: 2014-06-15 08:21:58
I heard the CEO of bitcoin was arrested. I read it on the internet.
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:56:57
I agree with most on this sub about the marriage, but if you wish to continue
Just create a new wallet - with 10% of your holdings and tell your wife that that is your wallet.
Easy - encrypt, backup and hide real wallet. Maybe in a truecrypt on spideroak.

I used to buy eft cards online previously with btc in aus, can't remember the site but this isn't the first of its kind. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:59:59
Cute girl talkes about bitcoin....never thought id be able to use those words in a sentence.
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:21:09
That tie dye dress looks pretty nice.  Think my girl would look nice in that. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 07:14:05
so looks like doge will hit the moon before bitcoin, literally .
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:34:35
I didnt know what bu was till stuff was coming up in my feed in reddit,  i had to look out up as there was so much publicity. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:37:07
RemindMe! 16 days
@_date: 2016-11-06 00:47:46
Brought stuff a while back from here using btc, around Christmas,  which was helpful as i was broke as with fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:23:08
Nah its bitcoin core, the new one has these features,  its pretty good these days. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:20:12
Gotta love the currencies with "shilling"  in the name. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:53:16
index funds / etfs are simple, have hardly any fees, you dont need to worry about bad tenant's etc etc, simple and easy. compound interest in shares is worth well more than a house will give you.
this article is a good explanation
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:42:02
1 btc - minus fees tk move if want to sell.
So 9.9999999 (lightning) 
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:52:34
buy a hardware wallet, ensure you can keep it all safe. dont invest into real estate as a investment its a waste , alltough buying a house for youself is fine- pay this off, just don't buy multiple houses. invest a little into some easy index fund ETFs and HODL the rest
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:50:15
Yep, always the weakest point in security is always the person. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:05:30
Dude stop spamming 
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:52:13
Cool stuff.  Looks nice and simple,  which is what i was looking for in a tax tool, dont need heaps of complicated bloated shit like some other ones online. Ill give this a shot.
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:42:07
Fun game,  addictive, even told my gf and workmates about it,  more downloads coming! 
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:21:55
I just came to reddit to warn you guys of the same thing. 
DO NOT OPEN IT.    
Telltale signs of a false email - urgency, bad English,  email from stange address, attachment, and the biggest one email when not expecting it.
Please follow the simple guideline, if your not expecting an email esp with an attachment,  don't open it. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 03:45:13
buy an asic miner.
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:39:23
the only extra info i have is it was approx 20 coins, unknown what service was used, but apperently they were using a prepaid credit card under a false name - so obviously can see why now things didnt go well.
@_date: 2013-08-30 01:25:59
hello fellow south Aussie, I use coinjar, recommend it.
@_date: 2013-07-30 14:23:25
knc I reckon. if my power wasn't so expensive I would of put some money down on a knc, but instead got some gh with dhj who is selling knc shares.
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:18:09
yeah I'm still in!, sorry was sleeping. what's the total cost for the 2 coins? let me know and ill send it through. figuring they would be in the same package I only need to pay one lot of shipping right? than the second coin is free shipping as its in the same package?
@_date: 2013-07-15 09:48:55
swap 3 and 4.
@_date: 2013-09-25 21:29:42
I had the pleasure of meeting fire and earth (the two that created the site), such amazing and smart people, great to chat with. They even have a fda/gov approved lab!
@_date: 2013-08-17 23:38:56
no PayPal lol, ensures lots of trust right there.
@_date: 2013-08-16 13:09:13
my dad had what he called a key thingy with his bank. he just got it with a account he started and didn't ask for it, now that's awesome, anz doesn't even have the option which is disgraceful.
@_date: 2013-06-24 07:00:42
at a bar drinking, drunk, needed to throw up, Sprint to loo, I'm in cubicle, hear girls talking, realise I'm in girls loo, they say "she's been in there a while" and ask " are you ok in there". I reply in a real squeaky voice "yeah I'm ok"... than they say "ok just let us know if you need anything" and I say ok in a squeaky voice.
(I'm a guy) lulz
@_date: 2013-10-25 03:44:54
I heard nab was best too. It was actually a workmate at my friends work, apparently it was a small transaction (guessing a few btc), haven't got any more info, yet. Just wanted to give ppl a heads up to be careful. 
@_date: 2013-09-01 01:19:11
I just got my refund from Pp today from BFL too. today is a good day. you need to be assertive about it, you didn't receive an item. 
(also most people think assertive means asshole - and you can be assertive without being a dick, I was hella assertive, but was also understanding)
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:19:28
can you send to Australia too?, we seem to miss everything down here :(. ill be interested.
@_date: 2013-07-05 12:09:29
I found heaps of guides on a website called google, pretty cool website.
@_date: 2013-09-26 01:11:34
They came to Australia for EGA and I met them there. (I live in aus). Goes into my top 5 of best moments of my life.
@_date: 2013-08-16 11:19:49
I'm with anz and are jumping ship for this reason, contacted them a month or two ago and they had no options for 2fa which I think is fucking disgraceful. 2fa is the salt needed for a good password, a bank with millions of $$ should implement such a small change for better.

Bitcoin-qt. Original and the best. The base for btc, other apps that have access to funds I wouldn't trust with too much btc.
Blockchain is good too. But again -trust.
@_date: 2013-07-25 08:26:59
yeah I just received my "bitcoin is the future" shirt, wearing loud and proud.

Sorry to hear that. I used btcoxygen for a few days but had issues getting the btc out. Had to message and track down owner, the payouts never works.
@_date: 2013-09-26 01:14:44
Glad ill be getting at least half back, was beginning to think wouldn't get anything at all. Glad I only spent 2btc with them. It's all about diversifying you're buys.
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:09:06
ok only 2 for me, friends aren't interested. can I reserve them till you work out the shipping cost? in really excited about this, I couldn't justify spending the single cost from casascius.
@_date: 2013-06-29 22:35:34
do they come in a protective case - or just loose?
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:53:44
pretty decent write up. stuff about pi.
sorry for sarcasm, so sick of hearing the question so often.
edit- I used Google to find it. try different keywords. I used 3 before I got the above.
@_date: 2013-07-20 14:20:36
ah awesome, was hoping this would happen soon. coinjar is by far the best Australian bitcoin service. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:17:56
Omg, brought something from them tonight and was thinking to myself "these guys really should accept btc"
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:20:00

been using coinjar for a while, I'd have to say best service in Australia at the moment. really low fees which is what I love.
