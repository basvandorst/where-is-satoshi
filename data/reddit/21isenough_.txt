What they published has nothing to do with Shamir's Secret. It's wrong. False explanation.
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:03:45
I've been made aware of Odoo today. Sound like an interesting idea to build that into Odoo, yes. So far it's not.

Agree. 
This one could easily be fitted with a bill acceptor. I also believe there's millions of people who can't spare "bigish" sums and would be happy to buy 3.50 EUR worth of bitcoin every other day/week. 
Literally hundreds of millions, globally speaking. That's for them.
@_date: 2019-10-30 07:57:42
Yes, NFC and also "Lnurl". Allows you to "scan to receive".
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:44:10
���� Sorry for the seizure. I blame my phone's fancy auto editing settings. 
Thank you! Stay tuned for more ��⚡
@_date: 2019-10-30 23:36:37
Not at all, could easily be added ���� That's the way to go. Better to have a million affordable ATM to reach a broader audience than to "only" have thousands expensive ones. Decentralise the ATM industry ��
@_date: 2019-10-30 07:58:26
With coins inserted into the machine:

Why was the comment above deleted? Did the user delete it themselves?
@_date: 2019-10-30 23:34:23
That's exactly true. Many of your points listed I thought about or discussed it with people. 
Thanks for your thorough response. Very valuable ����
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:55:19
There will definitely be more. Stay tuned ;-)

It's made from Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) and the imprint is also done with the laser. It's the same laser just with less strength so it only engraves rather than cut through.
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:06:41
Cool. Hit me up with any questions, if they arise. Happy to help.
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:05:12
The hardware in there can be purchased for 50-70 bucks, depending on where you order it from. 
Here's the list:
@_date: 2019-12-21 21:00:20
That's more or less what I'm planning to do.
By default the ATM doesn't store any credentials in volatile memory. All credentials are only available during run time and need to be reloaded (via QR code) after reboot/power loss.
I plan to have a second encrypted partition, where credentials can be stored in non-volatile memory and would need to be decrypted (not via keyboard) but again via a qr code encoded password. The interaction for users via qr codes is really quite handy and I've grown to like it quite a bit.
@_date: 2018-11-03 11:16:37
������ A discount? That's hilarious. If anything you have to pay a premium for not moving the market with your buy-in!!
 
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:02:53
Yeah, that's a good tool to work with. 
You enter the seed in the "mnemonic" field and the your passphrase in the field just below that. 
Then you scroll down to check the addresses it derived from this data. You have a 12 word seed and a passphrase, correct?
@_date: 2018-11-02 23:20:36
Have you tried to derive the addresses associated to your seed/passphrase and compare them with ones used in your transactions?
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:43:18
Now, one more important thing to note:There is a difference between external and internal addresses. External being the ones to receive to and internal ones being change addresses. On the tool  [ you have the option to switch between "External / Internal". Enter "0" for external addresses and enter "1" for internal addresses.
I mention this, because I'm not sure where Samurai wallet sweeps paper wallets to. Please go check out your internal (1) range of addresses.
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:31:24
No, what you should do is compare the derived addresses from the tool ([ with the addresses you used.
You swiped one of your paper wallets with Samurai Wallet and it ended up on this address: 1HZMrktQe7FGqgGTJYMhGishpWXkpmH4wG (according to your description)
This address should now be among those you derive from your seed/passphrase with the mentioned tool. You don't need Sentinel for this. Just check the list of addresses the tool shows you, with the ones you know belong to your wallet.
@_date: 2018-11-03 13:14:55
�������� I will. Sorry ��
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:58:19
Yes, regulations certainly would limit certain things. We'll see, need to do some research.
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:11:54
Awesome. Great to hear that you'd be willing to contribute. Thanks!!
@_date: 2019-09-08 22:23:56
Higher quality video:  
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:22:06
So far I don't. But that's just a matter of another variable. As of right now, I just query the bitcoin price from bitcoinaverage.com
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:14:37
Yes, there's some ideas. But first a little more improvement on this version.
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:52:50
Unfortunately not. Yet. That's next, a nice case to build it into ;-)
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:05:20
Since this is a proof of concept, both coins and bitcoin are my own.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:57:23
Oh, that's great to hear. Love it.
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:06:38
At this point I'm struggling a little with the qr code reading. The single board computer I'm using is not that power full and has problems with high quality video streams. 
But I'll find a solution certainly.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:34:42
Sure thing:
I'll be adding description for hardware parts and installation soon.
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:35:46
Since both coins and BTC are mine, yes. If I were to use it in a professional setting where actually sold bitcoin to people, I couldn't. People would walk away with more bitcoin in their wallets and I would have to deal with the coins.
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:10:42
Interesting thought. I'll try that later....
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:09:08
Correct :-D
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:54:28
Yes, good question. There would be an error message and another scan for a the code. Or ask for a different wallet. Worst case, the coins would need to be returned.
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:03:39
Absolutely right ����
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:07:23
That's one of the main problems I have. The Raspberry Pi Zeros 512MB of memory and the slow cpu make it generally hard to handle QR codes.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:15:11
Perpetuum coin mobile
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:38:36
True. However, small businesses literally buy coins from banks to have change in their shops. Why not just get them right there out of the ATM? ��
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:42:22
Yes �� It's like printing myself money. 
I could imagine those little "table" ATM would sit in coffees and barber shops and ice cream and corner stores. Hooked up to an exchange that takes care of the conversion. Simple, painless and easy onboarding for new users.
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:39:16
Yes. Built it from scratch. 
There's a RaspberryPi in it, which runs the software. And then there's
- A coin acceptor
- A 5MP camera 
- A simple button
- An E-Ink display 
.. and a bunch of jumper cables. All put together and written the software for it in Python ����
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:33:09
I make use of the REST API from my own Lightning Node (BTCPayserver). So, it's my own bitcoin ��
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:09:26
I'm querying the API from bitcoinaverage.com for now. Really just simply 4 lines of code. Could be changed to any other API.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:17:21
Little computer, button, camera, coin acceptor, E-Ink display, cables. Put it all together - voilà.
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:22:38
Yes, with a Raspberry Pi Zero. Then there's also a camera, a button, an E-Ink display and a bunch of jumper cables. All connected to the Raspberry Pi Zero.
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:09:50
That's s great idea :-D
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:59:35
It already works like that. If there's an unspecified invoice, it sends the amount displayed. Otherwise is makes sure the requested amount is equal to the one displayed. Then either rejects or pays the invoice.
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:11:31
Nope. I'm buying my own bitcoin with my own fist. Guess that's ok for now ��
@_date: 2019-09-09 00:11:00
Haha. Great, ask them all. I'll answer them all.
@_date: 2019-09-09 00:06:43
Put this in every other business. Ice cream, coffee, barber and mom-and-pop shops. Boom.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:58:05
Thanks man. It's super exciting to build it.
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:41:25
No, you can close a channel anytime. 
You will just need to force-close it rather than close it cooperatively. That can be done anytime - but you would always prefer to close a channel in cooperation with the connected node.
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:01:00
Thanks mate. I'ts a lovely proof of concept - buy a little bitcoin for 2 cents :-D
@_date: 2019-09-10 12:10:29
If a Lightning channel is not online, it can not receive nor send nor route payments. It's not available for payments. Also, you want to monitor your channel and make sure your counter party doesn't cheat. 
There's interesting technologies on the horizon that help to prevent this problem or at least mitigate it.
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:04:12
:-D Thank you, sir. Love to hear that.
@_date: 2019-09-10 11:29:17
Yes, not that simple. But there are interesting solutions for this. Can definitely make it smoother.
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:22:24
They land in the box. The coins and the BTC are both mine. It's a proof of concept to show how easy it can be. 
I'll keep improving it.
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:14:17
I will update my GitHub with accurate product and price descriptions. 
But a rough estimated guess, about 80 USD.
@_date: 2019-09-09 13:10:48
Sure, that would be an option, definitely.
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:36:22
By the way - There is no phone in that box. That's what's in there: 
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:33:44
This is technically possible if you trade security for convenience. You can use a custodial Lightning Wallet and you don't need to worry about channels at all. Instantly start to receive sats over Lightning. I fell comfortable having 20 or 30 bucks worth of bitcoin in such a wallet. 
Otherwise, correct. The user of the ATM would need to have an open channel with inbound capacity.
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:06:10
It's not super hard. Need dedication and time.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:56:47
Yeees! So true. Get rid of your coins before leaving the city.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:18:26
Yes, these are great ideas. 
So far I'm getting the price from the bitcoinaverage.com API. No markup. But easily be added.
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:59:49
Ahh, that's nice. Thx. I'll keep working on it and improving. Lovely project.
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:05:15
Really? You can get them cheaper than their face value? I never knew, that's ridiculous...
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:13:15
Yes, love the idea. Will check what's possible and keep improving the open source software at the same time.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:56:06
Great to hear :-D Stay tuned for updates.
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:58:48
Wohooooo, thank you �� Was a great pleasure to build.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:32:21
Agree :-D Going to look ridiculous how much sats you could get back then.
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:36:28
Yep. I wouldn't build that myself. There's some pretty reliable hardware out there: 
I could hook those up to my machine.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:08:03
I doubt that the exchange would be ok with that :-) Sound like they wouldn't make profit with that.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:23:17
No one will stop me. But since it's both my own coins and my own bitcoin, it kind doesn't really make me richer :-D But I could hook up with an exchange and turn it into a proper product.
@_date: 2019-09-12 13:15:05
�� Awesome. Thanks. It's self sovereignty (my phone knows it because I use it often).
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:47:43
Thank you!! Pleased to hear you like it. Will keep building.
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:54:53
Good idea ������
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:07:35
That's what I do :-D I found a loop hole in satoshis brilliant system. Haha.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:24:07
Lovely. I love that people like this idea. Looking forward to see the first copies of it.
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:24:17
������ That's brilliant. Alright. Come get it, it's all in that box.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:45:11
Yes. Those ATMs at the airport.
@_date: 2019-09-09 19:42:27
Thanks very much. I think so too, yes. Love to build more.
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:56:51
Thanks. Not yet but I've had discussions and got some ideas �� Good to hear, that you'd be one of our clients ����
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:36:25
That is true. This is a proof of concept - to see how simple it can be built. It's open source so anybody can build one and run it themselves. 
Sell a little bitcoin of bitcoin to friends or family. Help them with on onboarding into bitcoin, getting used to it.
@_date: 2019-09-09 00:08:22
Yes. I'm always surprised how I can get my coins back and have more bitcoin in my Lightning wallet. It's as if I'm my own reserve bank, printing my own money :-D
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:30:43
It can recognize up to 6 different coins. They are being programmed into the coin acceptor. This acceptor then sends impulses to the RaspberryPi that interprets it and knows what coin has been inserted.
Unknown coins will be rejected through the bottom slid.
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:09:15
Yes, man, definitely. Ht me up with all the questions you have. I will help. 
Will update the GitHub repo with accurate details regarding hardware I used and installations instructions.
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:04:51
Will absolutely do so! I'll keep improving and adding features.
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:23:18
I put a high resolution video up into GDrive. Check it out here: 
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:09:22
Thank you. Quite some room for improvements but it's a first step ��
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:28:26
Glad you like it ��
@_date: 2019-09-09 13:11:19
Thanks! It's an absolute pleasure to build this. Can't stop.
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:34:22
Not dumb at all. 
Yes. If a smaller or larger amount is being requested, there will be an error message. Only the exact amount of satoshis will work.
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:52:44
Fiat in Latin means 'let it be done'. If something is done by fiat, it is done because of an official order given by someone in authority. 
The money we use today is called fiat money. Because it's opposed upon us by governments. It's officially ordered that we shall use the money governments want us to. Fiat money.
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:32:11
Nothing easier than that. Really simple. 
But I quite like the idea of super small bitcoin payments. Buy two cents worth of bitcoin - just about 200 satoshis right now ��
