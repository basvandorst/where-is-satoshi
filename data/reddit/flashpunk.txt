I went to the Bitcoin ATM in Toronto yesterday, because the price is currently hovering around $500 USD.
This was my first visit to the ATM and was actually kind of excited to buy a bitcoin with cash that I had just gotten out of the bank. When I walked in, i saw the ATM and on the screen in BIG BOLD LETTERS, was their current price. I couldn't believe it. "1 BTC = $849.99 CAD"
How in gods name does this make sense?
That, my friend, is greed.

I know a lot of you don't care about but I tweeted back at Stripe asking about support for litecoin (bitcoin's sister currency), and this is the response I got: 
Seems like they're really into the whole crypto thing!
This is huge.

Well I think this is cool...

That's strange, I do Interac Email Money Transfers all the time...

Interac deposits don't work through CIBC...

I'm happy with Quadriga thus far, so I likely won't be using Coinbase, however it's nice to have options.

Haven't heard that. If it does take that long is wonder if they just chose the wrong withdrawal method.

That's pretty sweet.

People still use bedside alarm clocks? (serious question)

Considering it. I'm a web dev, but it could be done in a phone app form.

Yeah, was thinking about a website so traders who are sitting at their computers could see changes without having to flip between charts.

Back for me as well, was 'down' when I posted it.
