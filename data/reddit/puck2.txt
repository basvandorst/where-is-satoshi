Well, currently Bitcoin Core is pushing to create what is called a "Fee Event" by forcing Bitcoin to run on full blocks. This will be a radical departure from Satoshi's original vision, so Bitcoin Core will become an alt-coin distribution.
@_date: 2015-12-23 16:11:24

Why does the tone here at consistently creep me out lately? I didn't fall for a conspiracy theory, obviously, as I am just here asking questions. Unfortunately, I find that I am consistently reprimanded for asking questions. This, contrary to your condescending reprimand, sets my conspiracy radar on full alert.
Why would [Blockstream]( work on a project with no incentive? And why would you suggest that I have fallen for a "conspiracy theory" when there is clear overlap between Blockstream developers, LN developers, and Bitcoin Core?
To put it bluntly, There must be *some* incentive! This incentive could be **goodwill**, **joy**, or **cold hard cash**, but to suggest that a group of people are putting great effort towards something that has, according to you **no incentive**, again makes me more wary than if you were a bit more honest and described even non-financial incentives.
In other words: I smell a rat.

Thanks for elucidating. I'd suggest everyone lay off the hair-trigger "conspiracy theory* accusations.

Backups don't mean squat if you lose the encryption codes. I'm kind of evangelical about this because I sometimes see people post the most arcane backup schemes which seem doomed to long-term human error. It doesn't matter how secure your setup is if you lose the codes or forget your system organization.

An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain. Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
The attacker can't:
Reverse other people's transactions Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed) Change the number of coins generated per block Create coins out of thin air Send coins that never belonged to him

Your logic doesn't flow correctly. Paypal suggests it will take Bitcoin as payment for digital goods. They have not suggested that the reverse will be true.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:54:35
I get your point, though the analogy is not exactly correct.
The volume of one USD banknote is 0.06943 in^3  (cubic inches).
Therefore, the volume of 700,000 USD (in Ones), is 28124 ft^3  (cubic feet), which is ~~ 0.43 the cargo capacity of a Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter aircraft (~~ 65000 ft^3 ).
OK, maybe you'd store it in 100s. Still 281.2 ft^3  (cubic feet), or ~~ 0.44 the volume of a gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) (~~ 18 m^3 ).
So, your condition is very different when you're dealing with that much cash.

To answer your question, specifically, here is the listed contingency plan




    Attacker may be able to defeat OP_CHECKSIG, which hashes transactions before signing.
    Attacker may be able to split the network by creating identical transactions or blocks with the same hashes.
    Attacker may be able to create blocks very quickly.
    The alert system may be compromised. 
    Users will be notified to shut down their clients. Note that the attacker may be able to send valid alerts, which could disrupt notification efforts.
    OP_CHECKSIG will be changed to use some other hash outside of old blocks.
    All addresses in the version-1 chain that have a known public key and at least one unspent output will have their public keys hardcoded into the client. When a version-2 transaction spends one of these version-1 outputs, the hardcoded public key will be used instead of the hash.
    The version-1 chain will be securely hashed into a hash tree. At least the root of the version-1 tree will be hardcoded into the client.
    All hashing Bitcoin does will use the new hashing algorithm.

No, I'd say bitcoin will remain the 'gold standard,' and perhaps a faster alt will be used 'day-to-day.' Something that is remarkable to me is the interoperability of cryptocurrencies.

Hedging would allow merchants to stabilize volitity... Airlines hedge fuel prices, food producers hedge agricultural prices, for example... So Overstock could buy futures in Bitcoin and hedge against Bitcoin volitility. They give up future gains of value in exchange for offsetting losses due to drop in price of Bitcoin. Is this clear at all?

@_date: 2014-03-03 16:37:32
You can predict how many bitcoins you have in the future, so it would technically function as a store of value. USD/XBT exchange fluctuation is one measure of stored value, just as USD/XAU is a measure of stored value. If there was *NO* stored value, there would be no exchange rate.
Perhaps an example would make sense... Lets say I am leaving my home and do not plan to return. I have 100 gold coins but am unable to travel with them. I decide to change them into USD at a pawn shop, but am still wary of traveling with so much cash. So I visit a [Lamassu Bitcoin ATM]( and change my cash into a code that signifies I own bitcoins...
I now travel to my new location and bring *VALUE* with me... I understand that this value may have changed (up or down) during this time... but it a non-zero value.

I understand and appreciate that you can separate your views of technical proposals from the way that these proposals are discussed and/or censored in this, the most visible public forum that Bitcoin has. For me, it is difficult to separate these two, so I read the censorship as a manifestation of a philosophy which must be antithetical to what I understand Bitcoin to represent. Therefore, I feel compelled to look for any and all alternatives to what has become known as "Core." If my methodology is flawed, I am sorry. I am a Bitcoin enthusiast, but not a coder. So I must trust somebody, and I have seen enough not to trust "Core". Perhaps I can be won back over, but for now, I'm looking for alternatives (currently running an Unlimited node, maybe I'll switch it to Classic.)

I for one, am more comfortable with 12 word randomly generated seed on a HD wallet like Electrum. Never has to see a printer, very low tech (on the storage end). I am concerned about 3 things in your setup:
* Printer memory. Is your paper wallet stored anywhere in your printer? Do you know how to delete that memory?
* Paper/ink failure (moisture, degradation, rotting, fire, etc.) This is an unavoidable problem. If your region floods, could all your paper wallets+backups be destroyed?
* This "easy to remember hard to guess" encryption of yours. Sounds risky. I have read too many horror stories of forgotton encryption passwords.
I say: If you have to write down an encryption password, why not just use a Hierarchically Determanistic wallet generated from 12 random words... then you just have to write those down. And 99.99% of the people on this planet wouldn't even know what they were if they found them.

I am most excited about Bitcoin when I pay for something. I bought a few things on Overstock, I've donated to some causes, I've paid for NFSN hosting, fastmail email service, PIA VPN service, etc. I have used Purse.io. I think I am a real Bitcoin *user,* and not for all the things the news says Bitcoin is used for. I guess as I type this out, I see that Bitcoin could be a backbone for remittances and Paypal, etc, but this is less exciting, and I think loses the point of feeling like there is *CASH* on my phone. That's what gets me excited: *CASH ON MY PHONE*. Not fake numbers representing cash somewhere else, but *CASH ON MY PHONE* that I can lose, give away, horde, spend, whatever the EFF I want. Thanks for listening. I guess I will stick with Bitcoin, because really, hardly anyone gives a flying f"&amp;k about Bitcoin yet, let alone Monero, Ethereum or whatever.

Again, you confuse 'block size limit' with 'block size.' It has been demonstrated that the concerns you raise can be determined by miners and nodes setting block sizes, and that no arbitrary cap need be set, as all actors will work within their self interest to maintain Bitcoin operability and personal/organizational profitability.

I guess when Silk Road blew up and then Mt. Gox blew up, I realized that fundamentally Bitcoin was bedrock and these were just artifices built on top. So when they fell apart, I realized that the strength of bitcoin was *Bitcoin*. now I feel like the earth is moving under my feet and the actual bedrock of Bitcoin is shifting or perhaps crumbling. I am questioning the premise of "Veris in Numeris" because I see that human frailty is behind it. I see now that Miners can ahve a closed door meeting and decide anything they want to. They can increase emission rates, they can change PoW. Anything. Call me crazy, but if I had told you four years ago that a closed door meeting in China would be deciding the fate of the entire Bitcoin space, you would have said I'm crazy, and I'm describing central banking. Well that's what we have now in Bitcoin ~ we have central banking with less governance and/or oversight than we have with or good ol' Federal Reserve from Jeckyl Island.

Well, like many things, everyone has their own pace of discovery, and the fact is I have a "day job" so can only follow the crypto space sporadically. I have been variously interested in NXT, Maidspace, Ethereum, Monero, and even Mastercoin, but somehow have always refocused on Bitcoin. But this time feels different. It sort of feels like the wind is out of Bitcoin's sails, and I'm trying to figure out where the wind may have gone. Perhaps Ethereum, but I am skeptical of the whole IOT space and smart contracts seem like a nightmare that will have to be backed up by regular old paper contracts with lawyers. Or maybe Ethereum reminds me too much of the Matrix. I like that Bitcoin or Monero could be used in an old Moroccan Bazaar with cheap android phones. What do you think will overtake Bitcoin in market cap and/or usage?

@_date: 2012-08-17 15:18:02
I know what you're saying... I am definitely not storing my "nest egg" in the Blockchain... What I mean to say is that I perceive (right or wrong) Bitcoin as a store of value rather than a long-term medium of exchange, kind of like I see gold.. All of those questions on gold forums like "but where can you spend your gold coins?" are very similar to the comments here of "but where can you spend your Bitcoins?" I may have just entered the market at the right time (tripled my BTC value in a few months) so I have a undoubtedly biased view. My point is that I'm not concerned about whether I can buy a pint of beer for a few Satoshis... I'm looking at this like a long-term investment as a store of value, not unlike the Silver coins I bought for $4 back in 2001 (now worth $25).

I am not looking to start another cryptocurrency, nor am I trying to undermine bitcoin (I own a few myself). In other words, I'm not a *hater*.
However, I think that an analysis of the energy required to maintain the blockchain is certainly a valid point of discussion. I sense in your reply a defensiveness that I in no way intended to illicit, but that is very elucidating in itself.
[EROEI]( and other types of payback analyses are **very** important when discussing alternatives to currency systems. We must be open to analyzing proposed alternatives to existing systems in this context, otherwise we may be blind to systemic risks of failure and/or collapse due to unforseen bottlenecks of resource sustainability.
**TL;DR** *If* benefits of bitcoin exchange do not outweigh the cost of energy to produce/maintain bitcoins, the system will fail or be forced to radically change. Wrapping my head around this type of recursive analysis is too complicated for me on this Sunday afternoon, hence my proposal to this group this discussion topic. I'm not trying to (nor can I) threaten bitcoin, so please don't take any offence.

The rise in the BTC/USD ratio would not be called inflation but rather a rise in exchange rate or value. Price inflation would be the rise in the price of a good or commodity and currency inflation would be an increase in the money supply. Neither of these are occurring as BTC passes the $10 threshold.

I've been reading charts for a long time, and this one looks like it has some room to run. Also, never forget that there is always a flip side to every trade, so as you see BTC value going up, think in the back of your mind that the value of the correlated asset (in this case USD) is going down.

Would these banks be developing a similar product to Bitcoin? Or is there a possibility that they would use Bitcoin?

My experience... No fees and very easy transfer (make sure to save your deposit receipt to email for deposit credit). The transfer took about a day. I can't remember exactly how long it took, and a bit depended that it was about 1/2 a day til I was home to send a copy of the receipt, so if you deposit and then email the receipt copy right then, it might be quicker. No fees, other than transaction fees on purchases. I was a newbie, so I didn't remember to place limit orders, so I paid a bit more than I should have for the Bitcoins. That is really the issue. If you want them fast, you're going to pay more. If you can wait, your limit order may be filled so you can get Bitcoins for a little less.

So at this point you consider a self-hosted Bitcoin client (at home, on the PC) more secure (assuming standard safety procedures taken here) than an online service such as Blockchain.info?
My one concern is that while I try to be secure at home, I am not a security specialist, so am unaware if there is a vulnerability that I may not be taking into account, whereas my assumption (hopefully not always unfounded) is that these online services have experts on board who are taking these things into consideration. Obviously, this would have been an unfounded assumption in the case of Bitcoinica, but I also have a hunch that major breaches Bitcoinica's serve as big red flags which make the system as a whole more secure going forward.

Right, but you said that "If you allow an unlimited number of people to choose botnet mining, then people will buy botnets until they have driven the benefit/cost ratio down to that of legal mining."
So we are back to the question at hand, which is: "Is mining via botnet unethical (*read: illegal, in your formulation*) and, by your graphic assertion: is it akin to "Stabbing a dude in the face."
If, rather than brutal stabbing, we see Botnet mining as picking up pennies that some dude is dropping, unwittingly, from his pockets, then we are back to OP original question. *(Yes, you could tap him on the shoulder and give him his pennies back, but you aren't actually doing him wrong, you are just not doing right)*.
The assertion that **everyone** will set up a botnet because it proves worthwhile overestimates the efficiency of this (and all) marketplaces. Just because McDonalds restaurants  are wildly profitable, doesn't mean that we all open up McDonalds restaurants, nor does it mean that there is one on every corner (well, not *really*). So, botnet mining could be profitable for those who have the *skill, wherewithal, and passion* to make it happen, and it could still remain a small fraction of the overall BTC ecosystem. In other words, you are ignoring the work/knowledge involved in setting up and tending the botnet.
Reading through this whole thread, I like the idea of sending some BTC to each member of the botnet at some point, and then asking them if they would like to continue participating.

It requires a network, obviously. But you can have a wallet which is not connected to the internet, to which you receive funds. This is generally called a "paper wallet" and could be kept in a safe somewhere, or on a thumb drive under your mattress... In my post, which is more a thought experiment for discussion than a fully fledged opinion, I am referring to using bitcoin for offline "transactions" while the bitcoin network takes care of the payment. In other words, using BIC to buy items locally rather than via the internet. In this case, you wouldn't really have (or want) to use a "paper wallet." Cell phone apps such as those provided by blockchain.info might be useful in completing "real-world" transactions.

"Soccer moms" in this type of scenario will always use a service layer... they pay to get the car washed,  buy lunchables, have baristas make coffee,  etc. Your argument is tautological in that you are essentially arguing that non technical users will use less technically sophisticated methods of interacting with bitcoin.

 ..."blockchain technology, and not specifically Bitcoin"...
How many times do we have to hear this? The blockchain and bitcoin are one entertangled technology! Of course the banks could run a fork of Bitcoin, but who is going to "mine"? And if there is no mining, or if all mining is "in-house" then we are back to the same old Byzantine Generals problem again. Bitcoin's radical innovation is a distributed trustless ledger, not an inhouse, trust-required ledger.

Big name acts and famous movies are plentiful on torrent networks, but new, obscure stuff isn't. By paying microtransactions to seeders, there would be an incentive to seed files for artists, who may have a separate strategy for making money. This would take care of distribution. I think it is shortsighted to blame artists for deals with record companies. I have family members who toured for 10 years and then got signed by *Island* only to be dropped when the album didn't sell well in the first few weeks. There has to be a better way. Blaming artists for signing bad deals is not cool... so many times they are sold a pile of lies.

This is where our opinions diverge. I believe that the manipulation of perception is unnecessary, and that innovation in functionality, services, etc. are far more important. I don't car about perception if it isn't driven by raw fascination and awe. If you want to drive perception, find a merchant who accepts Bitcoin and show someone how to pay with your phone from a Bitcoin wallet. Explain how this transaction approximates cash. If their draw doesn't drop they aren't paying attention. I believe that cryptocurrency's core functionality will blow them away, and is more important than logos, etc.

I think you're on to something. My problem with these proof-of-existence concepts is that future file forms of identical content could have different hashes. If I save Satoshi's whitepaper using Adobe Acrobat Pro, and revise some nonessential aspect of it (compression, etc), it might have a different hash. It could then be misidentified as unique or new. But if the paper included a hash from a timestamp server, essentially reversing the process of hash embedding, then a trivially revised file will still reveal the same timestamp.

I recommend running the full client for two reasons. 1. You are helping secure the entire Bitcoin network, and 2. You don't have to worry about things like other people's servers going down.
The new client downloads the blockchain much more quickly, and once it is downloaded, updates fairly rapidly assuming you let it update every once in a while.

Do you have half a bitcoin or half a dollar? One thing to do is make sure you denominate your bitcoin thinking appropriately as bitcoins. You've got to stop thinking about USD a bit in order to fill your brain with BTC.
Secondly, how sure are you that your QT wallet is secure? You want to make sure it is secure even before you put any significant BTC in it because it can be emptied at any point if it is compromised.

I hear your pain. A guy who bought 1000 bitcoins for $1 feels a lot different right now than someone who bought 1 bitcoin for $1000. But that's life. You use the word "community," which is nice, but really, this is a "market," insomuch as there isn't necessarily mutual care, just mutual interest in a particular currency/commodity.
Regarding folks who are trying to USE bitcoin, all I can say is that for now they will have to become comfortable with this type of swing. People who sold widgets for BTC when the exchange rate was $300 (Nov) had a lot of time to cash out to USD if they wanted to. Some people who sold goods for BTC recently are out some USD now, but time will tell if that is a long term loss or just a short blip.
In any case, I don't really know what can be done to address your concerns.

Yes but right now the janky exchange is a quick way to get bitcoins. The slow way is mining. If you wait till there is a perfect exchange/method, you'll be paying much more for each bitcoin anyway. Essentially, you'll be posting for the convenience and efficiency of your newfangled exchange.

Well, to the average bullion collector, silver has the same properties as gold... It is a metal that represents value. Just as Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, so is Litecoin.

To be clear, I only have a few Litecoins, but I think they are important.

When these writers refer to Bitcoin as if it was a company... an "upstart" in this case... I realize that they don't understand what is going on. Yes, exchanges like Mt.

There is so much talk these days about exchanges that the big picture is missed - Bitcoin is a financial ecosystem unto itself, and not an ad-on to the existing one.

John Sununu... *really!??*... G.H.W.Bush's chief of staff... Writing a positive editorial about Bitcoin? *Pinch me.*
Sununu concludes:






I think this is the story behind the story... Everyone got caught up in the bubble... and the *pop*... and along the way, Bitcoin became money. Suddenly, it became normal to discuss USD valuation of BTC. Just last year, this was just a joke to most of the financial press, let alone old guard like Sununu... now it is something real. 
Soon, instaid of saying that 1 BTC = 75 USD, we'll be saying that $1 is worth 0.0133 BTC.
Last week, a *pop* was heard round the world.

You don't have to flip it that many times. You are playing games with probability and statistics. The truth is, if you flip a coin that many times, the probability that 10 heads in a row will occur approaches 1, but the event can happen any time within the period of flipping and is not guaranteed to occur during the last 10 flips.

Yes, i tried the big logo thing too... Trust me you want it smaller... I like idea of an alternative bitcoin branding, but i think you need to put some thought behind the images, beyond just being visually appealing. Heck, Marlboro had the cowboy, Camel had Joe the Camel. These were icons. I like the hummingbird image and felt the most resonance to that one thematically in terms of its relationship to bitcoin. The smoking girl, maybe... But you should really have some idea off what these mean, otherwise they are too empty. Try to give flight to that hummingbird... It's got wings.

I also set up a "we accept bitcoin'"sign without an exact process in mind. We're a service (architecture and landscape architecture) so it would be easier than retail because I'd set up a payment address for an invoice to be paid in full. From a retail/convention transactions where time is of the essence, it seems like an app on your phone might be best. The Mycelium Wallet for Android has a very simple 'receive payment' button that can be denominated in USD out BTC.

I hold bitcoins, I've invested in mining bitcoins and litecoins, and I've convinced my business partner to allow us to accept bitcoins as payment for services. I've bought some computer hardware with bitcoins  but I'll wait to spend more once we receive payment in services with bitcoin. So, if I'm any judge on sentiment,  bitcoins will start flowing once a critical mass of people have bitcoins to buy and sell with that out makes sense as a business out individual to use the bitcoins that you take in to pay for your cost of doing business, keeping profit in a bitcoin wallet. That's why I'm less jazzed about bitcoin payment processors that instantly convert bitcoins to fiat, because out stops the money flow right there.

A story [x-post &gt;One guy stands in front of a Bank and starts mumbling about some SHA256 mumbo jumbo and everyone jostles him as they hurry in and out of the Bank. Over time, a few of these mindless sheep overhear the quiet mumblings of the guy, and gather around him, trying to make sense of what he is saying. Looking down, they notice that this quiet man mumbling has pockets which are growing more and more plump, filling with magic SHA256 beads. They ask him for some beads, and he says "go home and run your computer all day and all night and you can have some beads." So they do this and their pockets begin to fill with magic SHA256 beads. As their pockets begin to everflow, they start banging on the door of the Bank, to see if they might want some of these magic beads. The Bank stares blankly and mumbles something like "No, you cryptoanarchist, I only deal in Federally supplied Ones and Zeroes!" So the crowd continues to mill outside the bank, mumbling, pockets filling and emptying. **Then one day, a Hot Dog cart pulls up next to the crowd of mumbling SHA256 beadholders and says "Hey, I'll give you a Hot Dog for 0.00268 of those newfangled beads." And then they were no longer hungry and there was much rejoicing.**

This is important because conversion to fiat, as I understand it, would incur capital gains, while a direct purchase with bitcoins would be a separate transaction. I am thinking about this because some in this community may find that their bitcoins are adding up to USD equivalents which could allow the direct purchase of real estate.
I was not aware the payments were made through escrow/title companies, but your statement makes me think that there is a business opportunity here...
It is curious to me that you don't *understand the underlying issue*... many of us take quite seriously the notion that bitcoin is a real holder of value and facilitator of value transfer. Real Estate is similar, and of greater importance. It seems to me that as an attorney and broker hanging out on you must have given this some thought. I am also a licensed professional, and though I have not begun to do so, have certainly considered how I could integrate bitcoin payments into my professional lifel.

I believe, in my heart, that the real paradigm shift will occur when USD exchange values will be irrelevant to you as you go about your daily life. Until then, cryptocurrencies are in their infancy.

It is strange, no? Even 10% gain since last week on the coins I got for $90 seems like chump change. For many "*investors*" this would be a reasonable yearly return.
Have we been duped and/or won over by those calculations that divide the world's money supply by 21,000,000?

News from friedcat:


1. They will arrive at October as their earliest. The specs are unknown (only simulation results at this moment), but surely they will be much better than all available similar products in the market now.
2. Cryptocurrencies or mining of virtual currencies are OK. Exchanging them for fiat is less OK but the legal risk is mostly on the exchange operators' side. However as everyone knows, the policy in China is never predictable so there is indeed risks in the future. We have been considering and coping with this uncertainty from the day our chips passed the test and are on the start of building offshore company structures.
3. The access to company wallet is backed up and we back up shareholder information frequently. Also the division of work in Bitfountain is not yet so refined that there are no replaceable positions. We have already left our startup stage so it's become more organized, therefore backup employees are becoming more important and in our range of plan.
