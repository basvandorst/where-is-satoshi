Nothing is going to be deleted.  This post is 100% truth.  Brian Armstrong needs to grow a pair of balls and stop being a little bitch.

I'm just a normal person and not an l33t hacx3r like you guys.
Doesn't it worry you to buy bitcoin at $5,200/coin when normal people can't buy it?

The moral of the story is still intact.  The bitcoin exchanges are run by pussies.

Declined on Cash App for both of my cards.

I finally quit trying with the card and did an ACH.  I'm hoping it's less than 9 days and closer to 3-5 days.

Better yet, to follow up on my post....
Put gigantic lighted kiosks right in the middle of South Beach.  MIAMI.   Right in the fucking middle.  This Coinbase CEO has like a billion dollars.  He could put like 50 of them up and down Ocean Ave.  Imagine how many rich drunk people will walk up to it and make impulse investments.  BTC will hit $10,000 again.  The only ones you have now are ugly and hidden in some seedy ass place.   No one goes there because they think their ID will be stolen.  It’s too shady.  
This Coinbase is like one of the major leaders in the industry, with brand name recognition, but they’re sitting on their ass because their CEO is already rich and comfortable and he stopped taking risks.  He’s the antithesis of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.

Update:  Just had the money debited from my Bofa account but Coinbase still says 8 days left.  Now I'm getting a message that the next ACH transfer will take *11 days*.  Is this some kind of glitch or a sick joke?  F.U. Coinbase.  F.U.
I also applied for the Cash App Visa card, which is being mailed to me now.  Hoping to bypass the process by loading cash into this card.
Overall, it's been an exhausting process.
