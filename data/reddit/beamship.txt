It's a pretty weak analogy but a car in a car park can be seen, making it a possible target to anyone who can see it.  A private key is not seen by anyone other than who is allowed to see it.  There is not much effort in checking if a car door is locked or not, but there is considerable effort in trying to guess a private key.  There are so many possibilities so as to make it virtually impossible.  There are already people trying, who have been trying for years to generate key pairs that match existing addresses and I have yet to hear of a single instance of it happening.

You should re-evaluate your position on what is a Bitcoiner.  I would agree that your statement reflects the majority of early adopters.  But I don't think that was true as of the end of last year.  I would say that most people now aren't doing it for any political ideal but simply because they cannot ignore the upside potential.

You're ahead of the game when you acknowledge your limits and seek information.  I used to keep everything on Coinbase too for the same reason that I felt they could do a better job protecting my bitcoin than I can.

Another observation is that small businesses that have no shortage of customers are becoming cash only because they don't want to give a cut to the banks if they don't have to.  Those businesses will likely adopt bitcoin before they adopt credit cards because it fits with their model.
  
So it may be that we end up with bitcoin not because it benefits the customer but because the customer has no choice if they want to do business there.
I can think of a dozen businesses in my area that are like this.
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:43:08
You have a good point.  If you withdrew cash from your bank, they wouldn't be able to track it but that doesn't mean they wouldn't if they could.  I've had my bank call me about transactions I have made using my debit card to ensure that they comply with AML.  It's not that they do it because they can, it's because they can't turn a blind eye when it's convenient for them.  So if they see something happening, they have to report it, with cash, they can't see anything, so there is nothing to report.
  
This is also the reason bitcoin is going to stay, bitcoin is a gold mine to big data and no one has bigger data sets than US intelligence.

Bitcoin is real money.  
@_date: 2014-10-01 01:18:11


  
This is fundamentally true when it comes to security which is a large part of what bitcoin is and what makes it work.
  
But I also agree with what you've said.  What works for one person may not work for the next.  We all have our thresholds, we all live in our own bubble.  Bitcoin expands peoples bubble and that is one of the reasons I love it.  All of the things you see people being worried about are things that should be worried about.  It's important that it happens and that how we arrive at trust is constantly under review.  Embrace it but live a life that brings you sanity, this is important too.  But at the same time let us worry about the things that we should worry about.  It's how you arrived here.

Your reading comprehension leaves a lot to be desired.  I never said that small businesses would only accept bitcoin.  I said that these cash only businesses would be more likely to embrace bitcoin than CC because it fits with their no fee model on their end.
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:29:22
What's more important is the expectations for those that bought in during that time frame.  Price is only one part of this.  Where the majority of those people short or long?  Do they even care about the price or is this an ideological vehicle for them?  I bet the answers are all over the board.

Don't try and spin this.  Are you seriously blaming the community as a whole?  You said the price is our fault which is mind blowing and begs the question, why did you wait until now to tell us?  That's rhetorical if you didn't pick up on it..
  
Most of us understand the value of marketing, but it's not our primary jobs nor is it our fault that the price is falling.  But you can sit here and say it is until the sun doesn't shine because nobody can prove otherwise.
Also, I fundamentally disagree with what you said because bitcoin has proven to be both a commodity and a currency at the same time as well as much more.  It's unlike anything we have ever seen before.  It is an amalgamation.

The Bible is not historically accurate.  You'd serve the side of truth by not putting too much faith in its historical context.

It's not odd if you understand the systems in use.  In Europe they use a method of transfer that settles in less than half the time than in the US.  So Europeans can get their coin faster than people in the US.  Bitcoin will help break down that disparity.  Coinbase is helping with that but they are in the US and thus it takes longer for them to get and send funds.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:49:55
Their next move is to wait and see how much VC money Circle can bleed before Circle adapts to a model that is sustainable.
@_date: 2014-09-30 23:34:46
We don't even know what the distribution model looks like yet so it's way too early to speculate but this can't challenge bitcoin because it is not a replacement for bitcoin.  In order to challenge bitcoin, it needs to threaten the core of what makes bitcoin desirable.  This will not do that, but it will create its own niche and will exist along side bitcoin if they can get it out the door.

I won't say where I store my coins, but I will say that I employ BIP38 encryption using a very strong password with copies in different geographic locations.

We will sweep old addresses in the future.  No coin is ever lost for good(unless it's a real burn address).  As time goes on and computers become more powerful, we will have to change the protocol, but that change will only affect new blocks.  Old blocks will be open to attack and transactions will eventually be swept.  Even Satoshi's if they doesn't move them to newer blocks.  This is decades away unless a major flaw is found in the current schema.

There are plenty of dissenting voices around here.  No persons were harmed in the removal of the bot, all persons are still able to contribute to Link bots were useful as a tool of information until buttcoin realized they could use it to promote traffic to their sub.  The users of that abused the bot bare the responsibility here.
  
Another nice side effect is that you don't have users vote brigading other reddit threads that are linked.  This has an overall positive effect on perception of bitcoin since we don't have our most passionate members running around making us look like nutters.
  
The positives far outweigh the negatives.

Not only does your analogy suck, you're making assumptions about my political beliefs.  First I'm a statist, now I'm a libertarian.  Based on the evidence, I think you're just here to troll and argue.

Yea, I'll just ignore that orangered.. not gonna happen.
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:31:52
I've looked through your history and you are not an idiot.  So looking at charts is completely within your grasp.  Why are you here asking about something you can look up yourself?

This is the right way to think about it, but this guy is talking about sending his coins to Circle just because they sent him an invite.  Doesn't seem like good reasoning to me so I decided to contrast it with my statement.

Maybe?  Just because Stripe can do bitcoin transactions doesn't mean Facebook will turn that feature on.

This isn't true.  You are either secure or you're not, there is no in-between.  Due to the lack of submissions by people talking about how they have had their coins stolen, I think it's safe to say that the majority of us have no problem with keeping our shit secure.  You have failed to keep your shit secure and it is no ones fault but your own.  That's one of the beauties of bitcoin, it forces people to take personal responsibility and it's helping to undo the welfare state mentality where no one is responsible for their own actions.  With bitcoin, the buck stops with you.  This is survival of the fittest and you need to step up your game if you want to play.

That doesn't make any sense given the fact that the two schools of thought you mentioned are pretty much a western invention.  The rest of the world will use it for their own reasons and it's happening right now.  Look at China, Russia etc..

Gavin Andresen is not an average person and is not the demographic we need for Bitcoin to be accepted by the masses.  There is no better system for adoption than what we have now.  Anyone can look at 0.0004 and know how much of a whole bitcoin that is; it's basic math.  People who want to change it are either misguided or are hoping to slow adoption by making it more confusing and harder to understand.  Do not assist them by helping to create division over something like this.
  
The argument has been around for years and it always comes down to one thing:  Bitcoin denominations will happen when they need to.  In order for there to be need, the price of bitcoin needs to be much much higher than what we have now.  There is no need for this and it does nothing but confuse average people.  Bitcoin is already very confusing without having to memorize various arbitrary denominations.

What plot?  There is zero news about them shutting down; do you have a source?  Or does website down = your source?

Your posting history is hilarious.  Your first post less than 24 hours ago is literally asking why anyone would use bitcoin, then you said it's going to crash and now you are full-on bull.  All within 24 hours!

If you're in the US, use Coinbase, they're as reliable as they get.  If you decide to buy more than .1, I would urge you to investigate and learn about storage solutions that you control.
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:24:55
This won't fare well for you here since most of us are familiar with Coinbase.  We know that Coinbase is not a scam and is 100% legit.
  
You on the other hand, we know nothing about you except for what you tell us and it's not looking good.
  
Use of Coinbase is not a right and unless you work through this with them, you won't be getting anywhere by posting this drivel here.  They will whitelist people who trip their algorithm, but you have to work with them, most consumers with self-entitlement issues won't bother.

Bitcoin is more than a currency.  It's new and thus has new rules that don't fit your 'traditional economics'.
  
It's a mistake to treat it like current fiat systems when it's not anything like it.
  
Bitcoin isn't driving multiple countries economy.
  
Bitcoin doesn't need to be ~~stimulated~~ manipulated.

And 16 hours ago you said: All floors have been shattered. Expert chartists widely agree we are in the calm before the biggest crash we've ever seen.  
  
Downvoted for trolling.

Coinbase is wallet, it says so right on their front page.

One possibility is so that these random contract killers as you call them don't use their training to kill you or someone else when they have an episode as a result of their condition.

Don't forget that offchain transactions help to keep bloat off the blockchain.  This is a good thing too.  I would like to see a volunteer based movement where bitcoin companies published their private blockchain so that it's users can audit the systems they place their trust in.

The part you cited is pure conjecture and you're treating it as a statement of fact and attempting to argue it.  Whereas the statement preceding it is a statement of fact and you're choosing to ignore it.  Heh

Don't bother.  They aren't here to reason, they are only here to smear.  Look at their history during the presidential elections and what him and his team did to Ron Paul and company.
