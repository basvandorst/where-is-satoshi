Hey thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:00:24
Thanks for the idea, working on it.
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:55:23
cool, thanks!
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:56:19
Will do, thanks for the idea...
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:34:40
Yeah, not my strong suit...

Sure, I'm using ACINQ through the strike API for payments while I work out issues with my own node.  BTW, the payment node is published with the payment QR code.

Thanks.  This was just a proof of concept, definitely not a polished system :-)

Absolutely... This is a technical proof of concept and it was motivated by the arbitrary censoring of Reddit mods. I have no interest in censoring or modifying content (believe it or don't) and as far as "paying" it would take 10,000 posts (1 satoshi each) to make whopping whole cent. So I'm pretty sure profit was not the motive here! :-(

You are correct, nested replies are coming shortly.
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:26:15
So what flight to "safety" do you recommend?

Cash is certainly a viable strategy that has worked in the past, but keep in mind they have been manipulating the USD and your buying power for quite some time now... might be time to diversify your cash.

The securities markets have experienced what might be the start of the correction you are alluding to. While off its recent lows, not sure there isn't more to the downside still to come. I agree about homes... would love to sell our moneypit, but timing is not quite right yet for practical reasons. Personally, though, bitcoin has the potential to be a store of value and cash alternative, so seems like a logical move to have some (maybe 2-5%) - especially if you are hoping to get to a large cash position by the end of the year and are distrustful of markets and investments. Just my opinion...

Only stupid ones are the people who voted for these misfits. You're entitled to your misguided opinion though :}

Amen. Don't know how they have lasted this long...
