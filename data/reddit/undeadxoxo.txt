Correct, the decentralized ledger, called the blockchain, is where all the information about balances and transaction is stored. It has a limited size, 1 MB at the moment, with new blocks being mined circa every 10 minutes.
It's an auction in the sense that miners can choose which transactions to include, and will naturally include those with the highest fees. At the moment, the blockchain is congested, hence fees are high.
This is why second layer solutions such as Lightning Network are being worked on to remedy these issues. Whether these will be effective at all and whether the adoption will come soon enough, that you have to make your own mind up on based on your own research; there is plenty of material available if you search for it.

Stop being reasonable, this is @_date: 2018-01-23 16:12:53
Yes cause hard forks have worked so well so far for core
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:53:08
There is no way it can reach $1 mil, you must be delusional.
If the price was 1 million USD, minimum fee per byte would be 1 satoshi, the minimum transaction fee per byte would be 0.00000001 * 1,000,000 = $0.01, or one cent. 
The average Tx size is like 600 bytes or more, meaning 6 USD would be the MINIMUM, 1 sat/byte (unrealistically low) fee for any kind of transaction at all, and this is the best case scenario that won't even occur.

It's not really about whether a shitfork is deserving of something or not. I'm pretty sure people just want to claim their 'free money' and convert the shitcoins to something that will have long term value
I doubt a lot of people are dying to claim their Bitcoin Diamond Pro X Ultra coins expecting them to be useful long term
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:57:36
Mining is definitely worth the money and will be a for a while. A 1080 Ti can make back its own cost in a few months. Electricity is almost negligible if you do the calculations. Just switch to the most profitable algorithms based on the current market situation.
I've already made back most of its cost in about three months just by mining various altcoins. You can also convert them directly into stable currencies like ETH. Literally free money.

One shitty anecdote about a lucky Tx hits the front page, this is for you
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:12:16
You didn't read my post. Just mine altcoins and convert them into whatever you want such as BTC.

OP is being reasonable here and contributing to the discussion, stop downvoting him

Nice 0 effort comment with no actual valuable information

Top quality sarcasm op, well done
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:45:40
So you want to hide this fact from people?
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:14:41
I agree, interesting times ahead. It's so fun to watch all the markets when you only have a little bit invested that you're prepared to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:31:46
If you keep blaming everything on competing coins and made up "cults" and calling everyone shills, this will not solve anything. Bitcoin has a major problem, NOW. Stop ignoring that.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:53:00
The only valid use is speculation at the moment. I'm not trying to spread misinformation, this is the status quo, please face the reality
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:46:35
uhm RBF
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:01:57
Thanks for taking the time to reply. I see your point of view, you are right there is a lot of deliberate misinformation being spread but also some healthy skepticism, which I think shouldn't be ignored.
Your argument about 4MB blocks being filled -- I get what you are saying and maybe I don't understand this well enough, but do we know the time scale this would take for it to happen? Maybe it could give us enough time to roll out LN worldwide? Or am I completely mistaken? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:07:01
When did the purpose of BTC change completely though? This is not what anyone BTC wanted to be, or what it was supposed to be. It seems people are just giving up on it being a currency now, which is very sad
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:02:30
Bitcoin is not built to be anonymous though, there are other cryptos that focus on this
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:46
Yes, the convolution is what turned me to diversify. First explaining segwit soft fork and new addresses to people, now LN channels and off-chain transactions, it's getting really heavy to understand, which I think is detrimental to mainstream adoption, in this critical time.
Sure maybe it would be fine if this was all 'in the works' at its current state 1-2 years ago, but the mainstream crypto adoption wave has begun, and no one can stop it, so it's time to react appropriately and swiftly.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:11:34
I'm of the opinion that a lot of the skepticism about LN is misinterpreted as spreading so called "FUD" (I hate this acronym so much, it's such a cheap cop out and contributes nothing to the discussion by spamming it)
A lot of people have a lot of money invested in Bitcoin. LN is supposed to be one of the solutions to the current (emphasis on *current*) unusability of Bitcoin as a cheap, P2P decentralized **currency**.
Naturally, a lot of people will ask a lot of questions about LN, given that it's neither finished nor proven, because we all WANT it to work.
Most of the so called 'opponents' are people that are just skeptical about it; I'm not sure how so many of you are convinced it is going to be the golden bullet without any doubt.
There need to be questions asked, it needs to be scrutinized, vetted, discussed, debated, etc.
Instead of calling everything FUD, please just think about talking about it with an open mind.
You have to realize there is a possibility that it will actually fail, which however insignificant you think it may be, is real. Just look at segwit adoption etc. 2X was cancelled and now it's apparent that it would have helped. People always counter with "we can't keep expanding the blockchain forever into 5 petabyte blocks". NO ONE actually wants that, it's a complete strawman. Most people want a small increase to 2 or 4 MB, maybe for the next few **years**, just to make Bitcoin useable in the interim. Blocks will need to get bigger eventually anyway, even the hardcore core no2x people agree that we can't stay 1MB forever.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:25:39
Well at the moment it's not and it's impossible for most uses
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:25:04


Not sure if you're being sarcastic on purpose or if you're just that uninformed
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:46:25
Bitcoin is useless at the moment unfortunately, and there are other working solutions. People will migrate to solutions that work. The game has changed now, new players have entered the field. The crypto world is moving way faster than before when enthusiasts and devs were just playing around with ideas.
If you want mainstream adoption, you have to be ready to embrace the people when they come, as they come. 
Enthusiasts and long term believers can wait, but the masses do not, and will not wait. They do not care about your 18 month promises that some add-on fixes and patches will make the currency work again.
I've gotten rid of 80% of my BTC and bought various alts now, including BCH, and just enjoy watching the drama now. I think the overall crypto market will expand and in a few years I can have a nice portfolio without pulling my hair out because I bet on the wrong player.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:37:09
Soft forks like segwit seem to have just complicated the whole thing. Now we have two types of addresses, some of which some vendors do and some don't support, and this all needs to be explained to new users. Information overload. 
Lightning is looking be an even bigger failure in my opinion (I may be completely wrong about everything, I can't predict the future). Always 2 years away, opening and closing channels, yet another type of address, and the fact that lightning will only help a specific use case where you send money back and forth between two points frequently, and then you still have to settle on the chain anyway. 
"You can test it now with fake bitcoins on a mock website! It's almost here guys look!!!"
Soft forks and layers will just further complicate everything.
(Disclaimer: I still hold BTC but much less and have diversified into pretty much everything, yes including 'that' coin because I don't let emotions drive my investing)
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:27:59
Can someone translate OPs attempt at making a post for me into English?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:49:25
Yes it would of course, but it relies on non-mandatory action from people and a kind of centralized effort that I think will be very hard to achieve. 
Maybe SegWit should have been a hard fork? (I don't know what I'm talking about though too much so not sure if this would have been possible)
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:31:25
12 lambos ofc
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:51:04
Weird, the Bitcoin.org website says it's a decentralized peer to peer currency, with low transaction fees and fast confirmation times.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:38:39
Well hopefully you are right. I have no shame in saying I hold equal stake in both BTC and BCH and also further in altcoins. I don't have enough confidence right now to hold just a single coin, with so much drama and volatility, this way I can sleep at night.
Like I said in the other sub, I wish the forks didn't have to exist and the community was still unified. I think there are things that BTC are doing right but also some things that BCH are doing right as well, such as reacting to the market quickly and effectively. Nothing is almost always as black and white as people make it out to be.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:29:25
How is a personal anecdote about one lucky transaction relevant to anything at all?
This does absolutely nothing to invalidate OP's point, that the current network is completely unusable apart from moving huge amounts of money.
The same 'if everyone started using segwit at the same time' argument keeps getting said over and over, but maybe a soft fork was the wrong decision, and segwit is just a failure in itself.

Someone has to lose money in order for someone else to gain money. It's a zero sum game. Everyone can't be a winner.
