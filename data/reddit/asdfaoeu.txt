Luke-jr's for a while specifically blocked satoshi dice transactions and he was himself pretty vocal about his satoshi dice hate. He also seems adamant on using TBC rather than BTC. 
Nothing worthy of "religious butter" but noteworthy nonetheless.
But then again he's easily one of the most technically adept of the mining pool operators. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 06:11:30
Actually due to larger pools having a higher chance of mining a block following one of their own they get slightly less orphans. And as a result the payout from a larger pool is slightly more (probably insignificant though).

For all we know GHash.io, 50BTC, and btcguild are all one person and they already have got more than 50%.
Either way the way blockchain.info detects mining capacity by detecting the source ip address it first receives blocks from any mining pool could trivially just relay it out via other machines they own. They could even just use other bitcoin nodes to relay the transactions as they would do this masking the source ip address.
Either way the 51% thing is a bit of a misnomer. What you want to be able to do is create blocks faster than the rest of the network once you can do that you have full control over what goes in transactions and can pick your double spends, stop anyone else mining and etc. 
Interestingly you don't actually need to have previously mined you can just build a double spend transaction and then just build a new chain using your own miner and release that (a total of 6 blocks).
We can detect the aftermaths of these (massive amount of orphaned blocks/ long fork chains) but theres no preemptive way and theres no way to select what the legitimate chain of blocks (the network just selects the longest).


If you have an external party they just become network really.
It's not that bad though, these attacks only really apply to miners who control their own hardware any public pool would probably quickly face public backlash and miners would move away from them.
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:36:05
That's actually just miners who can usually update the block timestamp instead of going back to the server each time. Some miners update it faster than time, hence blocks in the future. It doesn't really matter and blocks with widely off timestamps should be rejected.
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:19:34
We only know about this pool because they have been mining honestly. Any miner who isn't currently on the network could be a threat and we would have no idea. There's no real way to determine which side of the fork is malicious so hence excluding them is pointless.

You can just wait for confirmations for transactions with no fees. Ones with fees aren't going to have this problem.

You can generate bitcoins addresses such that it requires two separate private/public keys to use. This would be done by

That would generate a new address which the private key can only be created using the private key of that public key (which is the one from the address for So if you ran that and gave them the output they could use that to recover the private key to the new address and be confident that only they could access it.

It's not to do with the risk. It's because the insurance payout would not be able to be paid by any insurance company. Insurance companies also never touch anything where the risk of an excessively large payout is high (like floods/terrorism). 
The only reason banks can currently be insured is because the issuer (the US government) of the insurance can just print money to meet the payout that doesn't really work if the debts are denominated in another currency.

That in theory would work though if you have 6 confirmations one miner would have to do 6 confirmations by themselves to get the money and I'm assuming they wouldn't help each other out because only one would get then result. (Unless each passed along a part of the reward????)
Also the cost of doing that attack is pretty high for the miner given 6 previous confirmations idk exactly the cost but block reward * confirmations / probability of success (based on the miners hash rate) would be way higher than 5000btc. 
The attacks the post talk about are just for blacklisting specific transactions so they don't require confirmations.

It's better to check using the GPG signature as they are done by different parties. Failing that checking the SHA256 hash would be also sufficient. Theoretically a malicious installer could overwrite the installer but I think thats a bit to tinfoil.
@_date: 2013-03-21 11:23:40
Normally the public key is not know until the transaction is redeemed (only a hash of it). The hash algorithm cannot be reversed with QC but they can get the private key from the public key. So they would have to wait until you release the public key in making a transfer then crack the private key and then somehow convince the network to include their transaction rather than yours. So doesn't make impossible just harder.

The reason why the asic chips are so effective is because they are specifically designed for computing bitcoin's double sha256 hash. While Google and NASA have tons of computing power its power efficiency is much worse than current asic chips and so wouldn't be that cost effective. toskud was referring people using them to generate double spends which is fraud. Generally one would think public institutions / companies wouldn't engage in fraud.

Thats attack 3 and of can't really be done on bitcoin because theres no way to prevent someone from copying your tx across to the main chain. (Unless you embed some other conflicting transaction in the main chain somehow??)

The theory is that people will see that massive bid wall and be comfortable buying knowing that they can easily sell later. Which pushes up the market. So it's possible for someone to put up a bid like this and let the prise rise and sell off btc they already have and then remove their bid without actually buying anything.

It's worth noting that the attacker also loses (n - 1) confirms * block reward every time his attack fails (by not immediately broadcasting his blocks). So that 2 confirm attack would cost the attacker 465btc per successful execution so it better be a big double spend.

Most likely it would be the first transaction or a fee paying transaction closely following it. In the standard client it will reject any transaction (not already included in a block) if it spends the same output as one already in its mempool. But a fee paying transactions / higher priority transactions are relayed fast so its likely a fee paying transaction will get to more nodes faster. The next question is whether the next miner will include it in the block which is dependant on the miners rules for the block (some don't include free transactions) and which transaction it has. So basically a lot of variables that will affect it.

They should be based on size. It costs the same to process a 100btc transaction as a 0.01btc transaction so why shouldn't the fee be the same? This discourages small transactions from polluting the block chain and forcing them to find alternative ways of settling the debt (think accumulating the transactions together. However I think there should be a factor based on the number of outputs vs number of inputs to encourage people to use up small transactions where the fee would otherwise make it pointless to reduce the unspent transactions.

The difficulty shouldn't affect how they process transactions.

I should have noted but I assume that the network transfer speed was instantaneous (its close to if you ignore the problems about transactions with no fees).

Most the the clients don't really support it without a bit of trickery but you can resend a transaction with a fee. Secondly transactions won't stay forever if they don't get included in a block, nodes will eventually discard transactions that are low priority and don't get included in a block.

People aren't going to like it when the price doubles and their order gets executed and then it drops again which is very likely given bitcoin's volatility. You should definitely just let people hold USD and buy immediately or have a policy of blocking orders until a manual confirmation if the btc price rises above 10% of the initial quote (or something along those lines).
Also have you considered using a system of call options provided by other users rather than relying on your own capital? Seems quite beneficial in avoiding the risk of volatility in bitcoin as well as increasing the amount of guaranteed orders you can place.

If you mining just for profitability it might not be worth it if the hash rate won't pay for the extra power. (The computer will use more power while mining rather than just being on)

The unspent transactions outputs are the only thing that actually needs to be kept. The blockchain should ideally be kept but it's only really needed if the miner somehow screws up or for archival purposes.
They've tried to block low value outputs to somewhat avoid this but in my opinion its a pretty terrible solution and it should be included properly in the fee structure.

The problem is accepting transactions not sending them. In that case you could just resend it with other coins.

You shouldn't be generating keys with less than 256bits of entropy (well or at least less than some slightly lower number). 
urandom will just pretend to work when its certainly not.

Not really you still need to be able to perform a 0 confirmation attack because the chains still share transactions. So that software bug allowed you to turn a 0 confirmation attack into a 6 confirmation attack. Also the developers actually picked the "bad" chain to continue on so you would have probably lost the money.

I wouldn't do this they can just as easily say you had already spent the bitcoins separately. The best way I think would be to make them send the bitcoin address they want them at through eBay. At least then you have some recourse if eBay bothers to investigate.

A couple of things, the server could generate hashes which have sets which contain the same number sequentially. You can fix this by giving an option to bet on the same number.
Secondly unless I'm mistake it seems very vulnerable to card counting as the odds are fixed and it uses the same deck?

Interesting but one of this side affects is arbitrage between exchanges and derivative markets becomes much harder as it would take longer for both orders to be executed increasing risk (although lag does this as well). Also it seems to slow down price discovery which creates more risk for margin traders and traders in short positions as they don't know much about the current liquidity.

The minimum fee that reference client miners will take is 0.1mbtc/kb yours is a 0.1mbtc fee for a 2.156kb transaction so the miners were just considering it the same as a no fee transaction. No fee transactions are processed based on priority which is based on how long the coins have been unspent.
Edit: blockexplorer shows you all the inputs 
@_date: 2013-07-21 13:24:22
No what matters is the number of confirmations. The chance that I can mine the next 6 blocks faster than the network can mine the next 6 blocks doesn't depend on the time between blocks at all. Well actually more like 6 confirms + network propagation delay.
The block time should be chosen based on network propagation speeds to minimise the orphan rate to something lower than &lt;10% to operate efficiently.

Sorry I should have checked what they were actually providing.
You'll want a tool to check sha256 hashes something like say  (I haven't actually used this). And run that on the installer file and check the hash matches 07c41ec698a69b83eafe57cb6bc902cc7e37750d6a9e69afdb97feb55cb906cc (assuming you're using 0.90). 
You can find that in the signed hashes on the download page  .
Additionally you should verify the GPG signature of that file I'm not sure how to do it on Windows but here's the Linux method:

Yeah, It is quite neat I wasn't familiar with how BTCJam worked and assumed it was BTCJam offering the funds. In which case it would make more sense for them to just buy the shares directly and you pay the difference between the loan and the share price. 
Seem like most of those loans must either be ponzi schemes or just people trying out the service though considering how high the interest is.

Thats pretty much it. Elliptic curve cryptography is vulnerable to shors algorithm which you can recover the key if you have enough qubits in polynomial time. While SHA hashes can be reduced by half their strength but that's still not enough to break them.
@_date: 2013-02-28 02:10:51
Well you are investing in the asset and then borrowing a percentage of the money back which puts you in the same investment position as what you would with margin trading. I don't see any other point to the service so that's why I thought they should just call it margin lending and work like that. 
Edit: Wait sorry didn't realised it was p2p I guess it makes sense how they did it then.

An "evil block" isn't any different from a normal one its just based on an older block in the blockchain the pool could be attempting to create a fork from. The miner wouldn't know this unless they had an instance of bitcoind running to check for that. And even then a pool with &gt;50% mining power can also exclude other miners thereby having more profitable blocks so whether economical miners would switch is also a question.

In addition to what hazekBTC said they also need to keep the block size low enough so people have to pay some transaction fee otherwise the mining incentives diminish and the network loses security.

@_date: 2013-03-07 14:21:33
Yeah I agree the block size needs to be increased a some point but there also needs to be some downward pressure on blocksize. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a good way to enforce this at a network level so it would have to be agreed between users. I think such a policy should be something like reduce/increase it such that the average required transaction fee is 2c USD or whatever happens to be stable. However something like this will have to be a result of policy decisions rather than automated bitcoin clients.

I don't know why 17chk4u was downvoted when he was right. 
Open source security only works when your system is actually secure not when you are dealing with insecure systems (i.e. the traditional banking system). They can't actually determine whether a transaction is fraudulent they just analyse all the factors they can to see if the risk to the transaction is more than what they are willing to risk. If attackers knew what factors they were using they could make their transactions seem lower risk. 
The difference between this and bitcoin is bitcoin actually doesn't have any current known flaws where as coinbase's fraud detection isn't even close to perfect.
