Yeah, the difference is the direction it's heading in.

It's not dead, but it's going down to at least $8,800 before it goes up again.

Here's a protip - when your mom even knows what cryptocurrency is, it's time to sell. Tops of bubbles always occur when the masses start to learn about assets that they really have no business knowing about. It's called hysteria. Also, I'm incredibly sorry to tell you this, but BTC isn't coming back to it's previous level for a very, very long time, if ever.

You guys are hilarious - trying to convince others not to sell like this entire place put together has any real buying or selling power. You guys couldn't move the market if you wanted to, and the large investors are about to teach you a very hard lesson about being the greater fool.

How does it feel to be the greatest fool?

As a general rule when it comes to the CIA's invasion of computers and cell phones, if you can imagine it, they have done it. They have some very intelligent people working for them who are far more creative and knowledgeable than you and I. Something as simple as a backdoor in Windows or malware for cellphones is just the very tip of the iceberg.
I would say it's highly likely that they've already planted backdoors in the hardware (meaning motherboards, processors and peripherals) that all of our computers run on. If you think you aren't being monitored, you're probably wrong. As much as I hate the invasion of privacy, this is the new face of power. I understand why they are doing it, and I don't believe it to be malicious at its roots. The country who knows more than everyone else has the most power. It's required to maintain our place of power in the world.

And what fundamentals are those? BTC has no fundamentals. It has no future. It's shown itself to be unusable for anything but speculation one the price breaches a surprisingly low level. If you're buying BTC based on "fundamentals" then you have a very hard lesson coming to you.

It's interesting how there are so many people like you who actually become angry when someone wants to sell, like any of you have any real effect on the market. If everyone in this subreddit sold at the same time, the price of BTC wouldn't budge even a single point. I don't think you realize how much money is flowing in and out at any given time. You can't fathom it. You guys are a drop in a very large ocean of money. Who cares if some redditor sells. The people who move the market are not hanging out here on reddit.
