But mining is a totally different kettle of fish.
Wasn't the purpose of mining was to give initial incentive for someone to provide the infrastructure for transactions to be processed? The coins provided by mining were the reward for work performed. So shouldn't reward be atleast some what proportional to effort required?
Why should someone that runs an old 486 software miner on a 56k modem be as rewarded as someone that runs a cluster of 1000's of asic miners?
Perhaps a fairer system would have been to not have any mined rewards at all and have payments based on pure transactions processed or something. Even then the person with the more GH/s is going to get more rewards so ... *shrugs*
And even then the rewards reduce over time to the point they are removed totally.

From what I can gather most of the bitcoin asic's used aren't general use cpu's (i think most have an additional controlling cpu chip that you can run the os on). They are addon chips that accelerate one very specific calculation (someone with actual internal knowledge please correct this).






So from a "just try it" perspective it doesn't appear possible as the folding program would need to have a specific code situation where calculating sha-256 hashes would make a speed difference. 
That being said, it would make a great secondary use once btc mining is unprofitable for those chips! :D

rainbow lookup tables for bitcoin addresses?
i'd guess a stupid amount of storage would be required.
As for the OPS saving a storage I think you'd almost want to do the reverse.
Take all the addresses within the block chain save those to a database.
Run your address generator and compare each of these to your data base.
With the amount of electrical and cpu power required you'd make a better profit from mining most likely ;)

oh ok sorry, I TOTALLY got your original post waaay wrong ;) My mistake!
It seemed to me (in my head for what ever wrong reason) like you were local chinese working in Shanghai. ie. chinese sending money back to rural china (very common practice). Once again .. no idea why I thought this ;)

I agree a printed option would be much better.
Or alternatively allow someone to enter their btc address or show it a qr code. Printing would be the simplest way tho. Hoping it doesn't run out of ink 1/2 way thu!

no judgement eh? well lets see ... 
What is the correct way to backup an already encrypted bitcoin-qt wallet?
Just use the backup option and copy the wallet.dat to somewhere safe? I saw mention of a private key and I don't quite understand the reasoning for taking this out aswell.
So .. my existing wallet pc dies and I only have the wallet.dat I backed up earlier.
Can I just do a fresh install of bitoin-qt client point it at my old wallet.dat, put in my pass phrase and be good to go?

are there any security issues with any of these wallets at all?
electrum "Your client does not download the blockchain, it uses a remote server." ONLY uses a remote server for the blockchain. Anyone checked to see what it does?
Thanks! I'll have a look at both of those clients.

So people would be backing up the private key because of the possibility of forgetting the require pass phrase?
Doesn't the qt client prompt for the pass phrase when trying I do a transfer anyway? I suppose that's probably just a specific client thing and could be bypassed using other tools that just require the private key plus knowledge of the addresses right?

How were these "earnings" transferred to the bank from an exchange? If it came from mt.gox or something like that wouldn't you just say it was profits from "trades".

for the price you pay that is .. um .. poor.
Atleast they should either ... have them seperate OR if they must ship it like that  put packing on the inside that you have to remove before it can be turned on.

Until the ONLINE purchase of btc becomes a simple 2 min procedure common usage will not happen.
I spent 2 hours with a young guy interested in buying something from me in bitcoin. The only way he could get bitcoin was to go into a bank and had them dollars over the counter (AU based). Seeing this was like 8pm at night lets say the deal didn't go ahead.

I don't understand whats to think about.
I tried to use it and its US accounts only, im AUS based.
