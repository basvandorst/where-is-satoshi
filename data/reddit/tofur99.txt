@_date: 2018-01-09 00:06:23
People seem generally incapable of looking at anything other then what's right in front of their face.  They can't see how crypto is a new emerging technology, they expect it to be flawless immediately for some stupid reason.  These kinds of things need to evolve, internet 2.0 didn't happen overnight.

@_date: 2018-01-16 21:47:45
And remind us again, how did it get that high?  Oh that's right, went totally fucking parabolic and was massively overbought.
What goes up fast will come down fast.  Welcome to reality.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:58:55
lol, cope harder.  The new generation of crypto is making BTC look like a dinosaur, it doesn't even fucking do anything.  Not even close to being a usable currency, it's a shitty store of value as today is demonstrating since it can all evaporate in an hour.  It has it's name, that's it.
Myspace created the social network ecosystem, how'd that work out for that dinosaur?

Don't worry you're still pretty early, we don't even have that great of entry points to the market and the whole process is still intimidating to normal people.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:45:41
This is just a correction for an overbought BTC.  It had no business spiking up to almost 20K that fast.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:26:47
Why the fuck should BTC be the entirety of the crypto market?  Shit is unhealthy, and also lol just lol at BTC being world-scale reserve currency (aka 50-200 trillion market cap) and still being functional, it can't even handle 20K a coin.  Let's crawl before we run.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:47:48
zoom out, it's totally correlated.  Went from what, 8K to 19K in a few days?  It's good that we're back to 10K, that's where this shitcoin belongs until they make it worth more (aka make it usable for it's intended purpose).
I just can't wait until we get alt/fiat pairings from new exchanges so BTC can go fuck itself in it's own little corner and stop trashing the whole market with it's bipolar bullshit.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:10:47
Yeah the Korea fud was fake news, turned out to be just one guy and the rest of the gov was like "u wot m8, we aren't banning it".  30% of working Koreans invest in crypto, the government would have to be suicidal to ban it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:51:25
We've never seen an alt market with fiat pairings though, which is what he's talking about.  If BTC was isolated it wouldn't have nearly the effect on the market when it decides to correct, it still has a good market dominance % so it would prob influence but right now the entire goddamn market is forced to follow btc down into the shitter.  It's a joke.

No there's definitely a chance, just like in the beginning of the dot com bubble you could pick the top 20 and hit on some of them, but a lot of them ended up imploding too.  Gotta keep watching the market and adjust accordingly.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:04:13
A billion is pretty out there and I agree that's in the marginal returns area.  There's still a significant difference between 11M and say, 150M.  Lots of really cool next level stuff you can't have/do with 11M that you can with 150M.  
Ofc 11M is inconceivable to people barely scraping by so it's all relative, I personally wouldn't stop at 11M though.

Lol nah bro, having enough to survive and having enough to buy a magnificent house on the water with a garage filled with super cars and top end motorcycles with a netjet membership to go visit your magnificent cabin on a ski mountain out west and yearly superyacht rentals with close friends/family that are $100k+ a week are two completely different levels of satisfaction and enjoyment.  
Like comparing a hamburger from Mcdonalds to the finest steak money can buy prepared by a master chef, but even that isn't enough of a difference to do it justice.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:17:05
So what's your point, that somehow once you've reached a certain level you should just stop trying to make money?  What if you feel like signing up with netjets and cruising around in a nice bombadier?  That's not allowed?
11 mil is really isn't that much if you really want to be wealthy these days, it's certainly enough to live comfortably off the gains but why not try to turn it into 100mil or more?  You only live once.

You're still missing the point, nothing has been done.  Nothing appears to be close to being done.  Bitcoin has seen these issues coming a mile away and still hasn't done jack shit.  Every day they don't take action lessens the odds that btc stays on top.

Well over building did play into the housing crash, the states that got hit the hardest not coincidentally had been constructing houses as fast as possible (lookin' at you Florida).

@_date: 2017-12-04 15:15:11
You need to look at btc's history bro, bigass corrections are part of the game and it's silly to think it's somehow only going to go up without any more big corrections from here.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:32:32
Would depend entirely on what that 20k means to you.  Don't put anything into crypto you wouldn't mind losing forever.  10 years is also a very long time in the crypto world, you could make out like a bandit with this kinda move or end up with nothing because the industry shifted away from the current coins and you didn't make the move.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:27:27
Have you not been watching it's behavior the last 24 hours?  I have.  Every time it tries to drop too much a wave of green hits it and tosses it back up.  No way anyone has the patience to let it drop to 10k let alone 7k.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:22:18
Not when you require fast development to stay functional and not drive business elsewhere.  Some other coin can steal it from btc at this point, nothing is set in stone yet.

Yeah the delusion is strong in here, coinbase purchase of BCH hasn't even been up more then 10 minutes in the last 24 hours, each time it did the price skyrocketed.  BTC nuthuggers are in for a rude awakening here later today if coinbase gets its shit together (I hug no nuts, just chasing money).

You not caring doesn't have any bearing on what will happen if btc doesn't quickly upgrade itself to deal with the slow transfer times and high prices.  It'll get bled dry and some other coin will take it's market share, either pay attention or be ready to lose all your money (if it's sitting in btc).
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:21:18

@_date: 2018-05-30 17:43:41
the reason to be bearish is the price action, at least in the medium term.  Easily could see 4.5K btc, even lower is very possible.  Supply vs demand, if people don't really give a shit about fundamentals then the demand won't be there.
And lots of these alt shitcoins will go to 0 over the next couple years.
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:53:03
It's just pure bad trading, they aren't gunna be doing it for that reason alone.  You don't think people who were interested in crypto and going to this thing don't already have their stacks set up?  Why would you wait to buy until a bunch of big money is running the price up...
This is on par with Mr ballsack eyes Soros telling the world that he's getting into crypto and suckers actually believing that he wasn't already in place.  These kinda big players don't tell the competition when they're gunna be buying and they won't be buying when it's expected of them to, this is a strategy game after all.

@_date: 2018-06-23 00:04:44
It's not really their job to be in firefights, that's SWAT and the military.  It's just a common misconception that police on average are crack shots with their sidearm.  They don't train anymore then the average gun owning/carrying American who goes to the range once or twice a week, and often train significantly less.  A lot of police don't even like guns and never shot them before becoming officers.  
On the flipside, there's a lot of Americans that grew up shooting on a daily basis and are very good at it.  I personally am one of those but I was talking in generalities about the AR and why it's the one to have, in general.  I've seen it countless times, first time/shitty shooters can barely hit a 2ftx2ft target at 15 feet with a pistol but can pick up my AR and hit the same target at 20 yards every time with no issues.  It's just way easier to shoot.
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:29:02
Is it really that hard to believe?  I feel like you don't understand that shooting is a skill which like any other skill requires practice and effort over time.  Police aren't magical beings they're just people, often ones who had never shot a gun before police academy.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:03:45

His point is that some parts of the U.S have much more guns and much stronger castle doctrine laws then others.  In states like CT you essentially have to run out of your own house and have already been attacked before being allowed to fire on a intruder, in Texas and Florida type states as soon as they forcibly enter uninvited you're clear to fire on them.

@_date: 2018-06-13 14:43:06
see the last squeeze (the 1K 1 hour candle) for a easy example.  People were loading up on shorts and getting greedy even though price was flattening out.  Btc is super low liquidity, not hard for a whale or group of them to pump it enough to kick start the chain reaction of stop losses and liquidations of over leveraged shorters.  I don't think we're there yet but it'll prob happen, just how markets go.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:18:54
Yeah as far as I've been able to tell, at this point we are more likely to be in a extended bear for the rest of this year then we are to get one of those quick corrections that pumps out hard.  More '14 then the other ones, which ultimately I'm fine with cause those kind of corrections are the building blocks for the kind of run we had from 1K to 20K.  Just gotta follow the smart money and accumulate low with them before the run.

Cops take a long fucking time to show up even in cities/populated areas, in rural areas it can literally be hours before they show up.  So your first point is retarded.  Cops don't save you, all that'll happen is the 911 operator will have a recording of you getting killed.
Second of all, why the fuck would you have all your guns locked up and your ammo locked in a separate place?  Talk about unrealistic, you have at least one easily accessible.

what does that have to do with anything... it's about % drop off the high and the amount of time it takes to shake off the downtrend.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:34:19
Well first of all, most cops barely ever practice with their sidearms and are terrible shots.  Second of all, they're using pistols which are absolute shit in a live fire situation when you're all panicked.  Third of all, AR-15's are way fucking easier to use under duress like I already mentioned, way more stable with the shoulder anchor and a forward grip, can mount nice optics which make acquiring and staying on target WAY easier then a pistol, recoil is negligible, etc.  And finally, almost all criminals aren't looking for a gunfight, let alone a gunfight with someone wielding a AR-15.  They tuck tail and run so you often don't have to get all of them yourself.

@_date: 2018-06-21 18:43:55
Only complete idiots thought it would "go up forever".  Again, just read Wyckoff.  It isn't the smart money that drives bull runs past their initial/middle stages, it's the retail/dumb money.
Also, you severely underestimate human's propensity for self delusion and gambling.  Nobody thinks it'll happen to them.
This shit has played out in many markets and cycles over the past 100+ years.

Ask yourself why the whales would let it die off instead of milking it in a new market cycle....
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:30:10
Wyckoff lays it all out, read his shit.  Smart money is accumulating at the bottoms and distributing on the dumb money at the top.  Where are we....that's right, near the bottom whether it's here or 4K.  The dumb money is scared and won't jump in until it's pumping and approaching the top.
You don't make money following the herd of dumbasses.  See the '08 crash, millionaires were made in that cause they were buying everything up on the bottom when the dumbasses that were fomo'ing in at the top were capitulating and full of fear/depression. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:37:25


This describes every bull run and subsequent correction/bear market in every market ever.  Smart money vs dumb money, will always be this way.
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:51:33
Doesn't mean he's right either.  General rule of thumb, don't listen to a word any hedge fund manager says to the public.  They aren't saying it to help you.  In this case he's probably trying to get the fish to start buying so he can get the liquidity to fill his shorts.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:26:05
Nah it's going to at least 4.5K, that was just one stage of the after effects of the pop (the blowoff top at 20K was the pin hitting the bubble).

LMAO I'm not trying to disprove objective reality bro, I've been saying 'market cycles' over and over to you.  We are in a consolidation cycle after a bull run, there's been a couple of them in btc's life span.  
You're trying to claim it's gunna rip in pieces and I'm trying to tell you it's not, long term btc is extremely bullish.  Nothing goes straight up without pullbacks along the way, just not how shit works.

What kind of dumbass do you have to be to assume people are "constantly hiding out" and always on guard?  
It's real simple.  Breaking into a properly secured house makes noise.  You are alerted.  You go grab your rifle and take up a defensive position.  They bust in and get a 30 round mag dumped into them.  You and your family stay safe and there's one (or multiple) less criminals around.  This isn't theoretical it's happened countless times in the U.S over the years.
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:06:14
holy shit you're sooo salty.  Gotta assume anyone who points out how shitty btc looks is underwater in a short because they made the absolute worst move one could make, couldn't possibly be because they're objective neutral observers.  Sad!  Must be one of those idiots who bought the "hodl" narrative and has bled out most of your usd value the past months
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:59:13
no. shit.  goddamn you're thick, just cause it's consolidating a big bull run doesn't mean it's destined to go to 0, dumbass.  How do you survive these markets being so ignorant...
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:19:08
Jesus fucking christ.
Watch this, a trauma surgeon talking about the difference between center-fire rifle rounds and pistol rounds damage:  
Then look up the survival rates of pistol vs rifle wounds if that doc doesn't mention it which I think he does (hint: It's not even fucking close, rifles are on a completely different level).
Also, just use your common sense and powers of observation for a second.  SWAT teams aren't using pistol rounds, they are rocking short barreled M4's chambered in 5.56.  There's a reason for that: they work, really fucking well, and studies/research have shown that the round does less damage after passing through intermediate barriers then pistol rounds like your 9mm but are way more damaging on direct hits, aka a win-win for CQB in populated areas.
Military saying: You only use your pistol to fight your way to a rifle.  
Finally, you're talking to someone who's actually been shooting and passionate about it his whole life.  You sound like the countless people I've run into who know absolute fuck-all on this topic, like your whole post is an almost perfect caricature of them all.  Go do some goddamn research on this stuff, please.

There can be multiple bubbles, this won't be the last one but it definitely is one.  Any asset that goes from 1,000 to 20,000 in 1 year is gunna get fucking rekt by bears after the blowoff.

Flawed logic.  Everyone saw btc go on a insane bull run.  What do you think they'll do when it starts pumping again and looking like another bull run is kicking off?  Go read Wyckoff's stuff, he explains how all this goes down.  The masses don't buy in on the bottom where the smart money is accumulating, they buy in on the runup and at the top where the smart money distributes all over their faces.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:44:54
The justice system isn't perfect ya dumbass, people get away with stuff and get taken down for bullshit all the time.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:45:44
Stop deflecting.  If you can't see that btc is extremely bearish and headed for an extended bear market then you are deluding yourself and are gunna get rekt.  It's clear as day.
See ya at 5.8K, then 4K and probably 3K then maybe we can reverse the trend.  There will be some relief rallies along the way but this bitch is going down.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:59:27
That's how it ends up happening in the moment almost without fail, it's just a matter of how much you can keep it together.  Which is why the AR is so much better then a pistol: WAY easier/stable to shoot under duress/panic, each round does way more damage so every hit counts more, way more rounds on tap, can have a nice optic to aid in aiming under duress, etc etc.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:25:38
So why the shit did you try and claim that it's been only going up until mid december of '17... like we aren't fucking time travelers, if you chop off the rest of the chart of any of those parabolic blow offs w/ their corrections you could make the same claim about it.  Until proven otherwise this is a correction that will end just like the rest.
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:32:21
yeh you're right, it barely holding 6K is a sign of good demand, lmao listen to yourself bro.  What will you be saying when it's at 4K I wonder?
The btc run is over for awhile, people have moved on.

@_date: 2018-06-28 19:16:12
You don't have a original point, you were butthurt and so took him literally in order to reject his overarching point, which is that btc is in the process of dying through lack of market-wide demand and fiat injection.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:12:20
Nah the American dream is being able to defend yourself and family from people looking to do you/them harm without being sent to jail for doing so, which is what happens in a lot of cucked Euro countries.  Every animal has the inborn right to defend themselves, except humans in these shitty countries, just lol.
Fuckin love when you idiots try to tell us statistics about self injury.  It's like lecturing someone on the painfully obvious reality that having a pool in your backyard makes you more likely to drown and acting all smug about it.  No shit sherlock, I like to swim so I'm cool with that.
Also, any round that can incapacitate a human is going to punch through interior walls.  Turns out the AR-15 round (5.56x45) is less lethal after going through a wall then the 9mm pistol round as per FBI studies.  It's incredibly fast and light so it breaks up/tumbles when it hits hard barriers vs the heavy slow 9mm that keeps it's shape/weight and punches through.

"this invalidates my retarded viewpoint so therefore it simply isn't what it actually is"- you
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:07:28
Thought so, well then your points are either complete bullshit and make no sense or are irrelevant/pointless.  By the way, your chart only goes back to like 2015, btc's inception was like 2007.  Try bitstamp weekly on log next time ya amateur.  
BTC has had multiple parabolic runups with blow off tops that retrace a heavy %.  Sometimes it pumped again relatively soon after and others like in '14 it took years.
Regardless, as of right now this is just another blow off top that's consolidating.  BTC's lifetime chart is still very bullish, still on a whole going up.
Finally, your target $ is valid (though low probability since there's a lot of support between 6K and there) but the way you seem to have arrived at it is retarded, hence me saying wtf even is this ta.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:55:28
btc wouldn't be this low if either of those two things were invalid.  Unless you're taking them 100% literally to avoid having to face reality.  Supply (sellers) are way more abundant then buyers (demand).  Btc trades like any forex pair now, no hallmarks of new fiat being injected into it.  Just a bunch of traders trying to game one another.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:18:24
Lol nah they aren't hedging long, btc has been screaming bear for awhile now it's just a waste of money to go long.  These guys are making 6 figures shorting
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:52:59
yeah but in-between then and now btc could go sub 6k pretty fucking easily from where it is at the moment.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:30:01
more of a descending triangle, the bottom is pretty much flat with only slightly higher lows, much more significant pinching on the top side, squeezing it into the 6.5-7K funnel area

Most Americans serious about home defense have a AR-15.  Plenty enough to deal with a group of idiots on your home ground, happens often enough here to confirm that.

@_date: 2018-06-22 18:19:07
The last support tested before december was around 7.7-8K, before that was around 5.5K.  Look at the chart bro.  There's also a big algo swing fib target at 5.3K, and a even bigger one down around 3.5K
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:23:45
You ever pulled up the bitstamp chart on trading view, kick it into log scale and throw on the weekly timeframe?  This isn't the first correction to happen, nothing so far says that btc is in any real danger, it's just market cycles at work.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:04:49
that doesn't disprove what he's saying.  Look how weaksauce the bounce has been, bulls could barely get btc off the floor and just lol at it getting back above 7k.  No one wants this shit.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:28:27
5-5.3K.  Probably not in a straight line from here but the smart pro money (at least that I know/talk to) has been short for awhile and are just adding to the shorts on the little pops
@_date: 2018-06-23 16:02:52
They were imprisoned because it was found they weren't acting in self defense.  Usually because they set up booby traps and/or pursued the fleeing criminal past the point where they had grounds for still justifying it as self defense.  I know all about it ya sheep, lol.  That's part of being a responsible gun owner, something you wouldn't know shit about.
Difference is you serfs get locked up by your governments for 100% justified self defense, can't even use a goddamn kitchen knife.  The gov basically sides with the criminals trying to murder/rape you.  And then you have the gall to make fun of anyone else, shit's amazing.
And by the way, it's considered justified use of lethal force to stop a ARMED robbery in progress.  Aka you are in a gas station and a criminal holds up the cashier with a deadly weapon, you can send him to the hereafter no problem.
It is very entertaining to watch you spew hatred racism and ad hominem attacks at me then turn around and call me evil and hateful and so on.  Pot, meet kettle.  Aka projection, something you also projected on me at one point lmao, you're a mess dude.
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:44:12
Not right now, no.  It's painting a bigass descending triangle on the daily, we gunna continuation down to probably 4.5K, possibly under 3K.  Hope you got some fiat ready.

you sell stocks for profit bro, dividends are shit.  The aapl I have held for years is worth way more now then when I bought, if I sell it before or in the initial stages of a correction/bear then I'm basically unloading my bags on someone just like the smart money that sold the top of btc recently, holy shit you are coping so hard here.  Crypto is a market just like any other, doesn't matter if it's a market for corn or lima beans or cryptos, traders are gunna trade it all the same.

short term is a general timeframe, not specific like "in one month blah blah".
And it's not about predicting with 100% certainty, it's a probabilities game.  And BTC looks so fucking weak, no way I'd put money on going long anytime soon unless it proves that it's something other then weak af.

You still can't seem to grasp what I'm trying to tell you here.  What is bitcoin without a legitimate currency backing it up?  they are made up bullshit, that's what.  No government or army supporting them, no trade deals made with them, no bonds, no stock exchanges, nothing.  Its ephemeral, can blink out of existence tomorrow and no one will give a shit or be impacted besides the fools who pissed away a legit currency buying them.  People are hyping it up and holding, might as well replace bitcoins for baseball cards or some shit for all the worth they have.

A few online sites accepting it doesn't make it a currency.  Still haven't explained how it isn't totally dependent on the USD for it's value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:24:15
Yeah it seems a lot of bitcoin investors kinda go to an extreme with the whole 'hate the fiat, hate the establishment" kinda mindset.  Diversifying your portfolio is investing 101, and is especially crucial when dealing with a fledgling volatile thing like crypto.  Never put all your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:46:24
It's not about feeling safer about anything in particular it's about covering your ass for all eventualities.  If the stock market tanks then you've got your bitcoin, if bitcoin tanks you have the stock market.  If both tank then we're all fucked anyway and you better have guns bullets and food.  Don't put all eggs in one basket.  That said, the stock market has proven itself over the long term WAY more then bitcoin so I dunno why you feel safer with the latter but whatevs.

K.  Everyone who's "made a bunch of money" with bitcoin is basing that on USD.  They cash out bitcoin to USD, that is their barometer of success.  This is a retarded bubble that's gunna pop, I might buy a coin when it does but I'm sure as shit not tossing 10k into it.

Real estate still is a safe bet as far as investments go (houses aren't going anywhere, people will always need a place to live), a phone company is not comparable to the U.S stock exchanges or the USD.

Could being the key word there.  A whole lot of extreme and world shattering shit would have to happen for the USD to fall out of favor.  The same can't be said about bitcoin, which could disappear tomorrow  and nothing would change except a bunch of people would lose some USD.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:10:00
Dude if the USD collapses world economies and likely society as we know it will go along with it.  You're gunna be waiting awhile, and if it does happen your electronic 1's and 0's won't be worth shit... it'll be guns, bullets, seeds and food that become primary currency.

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:27:20
I mean nobody has explained to me yet how bitcoin isn't totally dependent on fiat currency for it's value.... the only way I see it gaining any value on its own merit is if all the major fiat's collapse and somehow society and world economies don't go with them.

It was the placement of the sell offs that did the damage more then the total amount.  He dumped at every good support level on the way down, so it probably wasn't ALL him responsible but he absolutely significantly added to the destruction of those support levels by absorbing a ton of buying pressure at each one.  
Then you realize he could've done a off market private sale instead of this strategic on market dumping and yeah...tinfoil hat is very warranted.

People tracked the transfers from mt gox wallets to exchanges and mapped it out:

He disclosed the info on his sales dude, that chart is those disclosures.  
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:54:02
His literal coins didn't do all the damage, it was where and when he off loaded bulk orders of btc.  He was instrumental in breaking significant support levels pretty much all the way down, like a boulder rolling down a hill and he did most of the pushing that got it started off the top of each hill.  From there it's algos and bots and panic sellers that did the rest.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:47:38
He could've done a private sale off the market and unloaded everything in one or two bulk sales instead of on the open market like he did.  He chose the path of most resistance and getting a worse return for his clients.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:53:06
Yeah but it has to be relatable history, you can't compare two totally different situations as if they're the same and then make decisions based off of it.  There's no major exchange hack like Mt. Gox right now, btc is way more well known, etc etc.  Back then mt gox was the biggest btc exchange by far, basically was the only one.  And it got taken out.  The FUD right now pales in comparison.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:48:32
Pretty sure the people who have been holding btc bought at a premium are the poor ones.  Smart money bailed out awhile ago.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:36:48
He pretty obviously wasn't minding his own business though, he dumped at almost every major support on the way down on the open market when it would've been easier and more lucrative for his clients to do a off market lump sum sale.  Basically went out of his way to fuck the market.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:46:45
No it's not, most btc is in cold storage and not in circulation in the markets, and most volume on the market is moving back and forth within tight ranges, not flat out exiting en mass like this guy was doing at every support level on the way down.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:30:04
The mt gox dumping the past two months was only 35K btc, there's still like 165K left.  Doesn't mean they'll get dumped but you're fooling yourself if you think there aren't whales with stacks big enough to keep this market in bear mode for a year+
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:20:22
Binance can't control phishers, it's up to the end user to make sure they aren't entering binance.com incorrectly and basic shit like that.

Other people have had a lot of shit right as well and they don't claim to have insider connections.  How do you know he has rich/influential friends?  He said so?  Think critically when it comes to people like him and always be very skeptical.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:17:19
Usually big btc/crypto sales are done off market and privately, since the market is pretty low liquidity it is A: difficult to unload a big stack and B: doing so will affect the price a lot, so they go through brokers/moderators off market and setup a private sale of the lump sum.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:28:14
Why are you stuck on 8 years or time in general, smart money got out regardless of when it got in... but it took a ton of buying to get it to 19K, way more then to get it to 1K.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:57:45
yeah and nothing in the past month has happened that can/will "kill" BTC.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:52:20
Already at the bottom bruh, we might get a stab down to the high 5K area but the sellers have spent most of their bullets already.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:29:36
yeah it's some japanese dude, kobayashi or something like that.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:10:37
how do you think it got so high in price...yes a ton of people bought to get it up there.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:23:30
look at the fucking chart bro, they obviously were sold right away.  Yes exactly, he made the big sales in december/january regardless of what he claimed in the report.  Wallet transfers don't lie.  No one is saying he legally couldn't do what he did, just that it was pretty much the most disruptive method possible and he ignored kraken and a big mining operation that offered to help him sell in a efficient manner and he's a grade A douchebag.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:28:11
I think it's 100% warranted for people to be pissed at this guy, if only from a purely moral/ethical point of view.  When you have the choice between crushing a market and not crushing it, and both avenues achieve your end goal (paying off creditors in this case)...yeah, he chose the route that impacted tons of people negatively.  Just a dick move
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:11:36
lmao no, consolidation is 10-20%.  You have no fucking clue dude.
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:47:28
new money won't jump in until it's an obvious rally and this macro 19K correction is firmly in the rearview mirror.  We're probably gunna be in a flat/bearish market until April or May to be honest, that runup to 19K was retarded and now we're paying for it.
Every time it's tried to break 12K it happens at point of weakness where buyers are already exhausted to some degree.  It'll be a fresh wave that'll crack it, not a stretched out one that's close to needing to correct.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:49:28

@_date: 2018-02-05 21:09:26
You severely underestimate the fomo.  When people see BTC healthy and climbing again they'll all pile in sure as day turns to night.
People are drawn to it because of the potential gains to be made, not because of "news".  I don't think btc had positive news that entire run up to 20K, at least nothing significant. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:54:14
Trying to catch a falling knife isn't sound strategy either which is what you're telling him to do.  Even more so at this point since we are undeniably close to the bottom at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:11:13
I dunno, if they say in plain language that they aren't interesting in banning anything but just want to protect investors from scams that would be pretty bullish.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:29:32
I didn't do math you nerd, lmao it's called eyeballing it and making a general point.  Can't compare %'s straight up like that, 20% swings over a couple days are a pretty mild thing in crypto, if that shit happened in most any other market people would be jumping out of office buildings.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:30:32
Like what?  That btc kept losing users because the tx fees and time were too bad?

ehhh thats debatable
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:15:11
current low prices?  BTC was 1K not too long ago... it's still priced high with plenty of room to fall.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:44:11
I mean the easiest rebuttal to that (and I'm not a BTC fanboy at all) is that BTC is the top dog already, so give it LN and it'll stay that way.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:16:05
the mt.gox trustee that did this selling off.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:58:13
His clients are the ones holding the 200K btc, he should've been trying to expend the least amount of that lump sum to pay off the creditors.  A off market lump sum sale would've achieved that far better then the route he chose to take (on market dumping), so ignoring all the damage he did to so many people with his decision, it was also the worst route to take for his clients.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:11:53
Same thing though, boils down to individuals not being careful and getting themselves phished.  Not binance's problem.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:55:12
Word is that it's not going to be negative, just that ICO's and exchanges need to be regulated to protect investors.  Same kinda shit Korea has been doing (Except for that one minister of justice cunt who said they were going to ban it all)
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:46:05
"Using mathematical terms"?  By referencing %?  You're projecting bro, if anyone belongs in that sub here it's you.  Still haven't made any counter point to mine about the differences in the markets and how throwing up stock market %'s and directly comparing to crypto is going full retard.
4-5% is a real bad day in the stock market.  A real bad day in crypto is 30%+

We are entering a new digital era in world financial markets. As we saw with the
development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual
currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial
processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them
go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response. The evolution of these assets, their
volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious
With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight and private sector
innovation, new technologies will allow American markets to evolve in responsible ways and
continue to grow our economy and increase prosperity. This hearing is an important part of
finding that balance.

millionaires like investment vehicles/stores of value and most importantly diversification of them, if btc continues to gain legitimacy over the years there will be more and more people looking to pick up a stack, like how a lot of rich people have a stack of gold/silver.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:10:22
crypto has shown itself to be mostly independent of the market forces that influence the rest of them, hence why investment houses have taken an interest in it, these are their words not mine.

How the hell do you know he had nothing to gain?  Could've so easily benefited privately from tanking the market price with his own accounts buying up btc cheap, or been part of a larger plan to tank it so wealthy groups/individuals could buy up btc at a cheap price, etc.  You have to ask yourself why he chose to go open market and sell at the crucial support zones he did instead of going the simpler and more lucrative route of a private bulk sale off market.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:47:08
It's a mere google search away ya dingleberry, do like 3 minutes of research next time.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:05:16
How is it dumb, please enlighten us... this guy sold 35K btc on the open market and when you plot out the times he did his sales it was blatantly intended to tank the price (every one was at a good support level, he basically bashed btc through its supports all the way down with the real dagger being the 18K sell off that blew through the support we were on before the drop to 6K).  He could've easily done this sell off privately, ask yourself why he chose to do it on open market and at these specific places.
charted out:  
Instead of downvoting why don't you geniuses come up with a counter point

lmao that's not an answer, either put up your evidence supporting it or admit you just made it up because the chart thingy stopped going down and started going up.
Also if a hedge fund manager is on cnbc telling you to buy something, fucking sell it.  Their interest in telling the fish to do something is so that they can take their money off them (generating liquidity at their targets).  They aren't in the business of giving out free tips that will help you compete with their plan.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:24:08
I was watching bitfinex when this started, it jumped $100-150 in 2 seconds to kick this off.  That's not organic natural movement it's a whale/group of whales market buying to trigger all the bots/algos into buying and also to trigger shorter's stop losses and liquidation points, hence the pump.  This isn't a pump built on organic willing buyers, it was built on unwilling buyers that are in limited supply (shorters getting rekt).
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:32:58
low liquidity, no regulations... if you don't think all the cryptos are manipulated I have a bridge I wanna sell you
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:15:35
If you (or a group of entities) control a large amount of the supply in a low liquidity commodity then you can control/influence the price action, especially when it's not regulated.  Do you even supply vs demand bro?
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:30:59
you still haven't provided a single thing to back your bullshit up.  Go on, how do you know we are in a new upcycle?  Let's hear some bullshit I can't wait.  None of the experienced professional traders I know are on that page with you, they're all still waiting on confirmation and their triggers to be met before they turn bullish.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:45:54

@_date: 2018-04-12 14:20:08
I was watching bitfinex when this kicked off bro, it went $100-150 in literally 2 seconds.  Which then triggered shorter's stop losses and liquidation points which led to the rest of the pump.  Absolutely 100% manipulation that caused this, though all the shorters going balls to the wall with their positions provided the fuel for it.

yeah nobody seems to want to hear it but I think this is just a relief rally that got pushed farther then normal because the all time high shorts that got liquidated on the way up (rocket fuel), the past couple days have been fomo buying.

Why do you say it bottomed out?  We both know you have no fucking idea if it did or why it would appear that way.  And no, not going into an "upcycle".  We're still under the logarithmic top trendline of this downtrend, until we break and hold that this is a relief rally in the crash.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:18:14
A lack of supply at those levels looks like the first visit we paid to 6K.  Doesn't stay there long.  There was plenty of supply under 7K this time around.  Dunno why people are so bullish.
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:09:11
bears have quite obviously been patiently waiting for bulls to run this up to a juicy level.  While we could be coming out of the bear market here that doesn't mean btc is immune to nasty drops from hereon out, will take awhile to shake the bears they don't just vanish overnight like this.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:14:06
uhh nope, shorts have been increasing since the big squeeze that kicked this bullshit "rally" off.  Longs closed hard on that pump and have stayed pretty low, seems twitter/youtube/reddit are bullish with their words but not with opening their wallets and putting money on it.

@_date: 2018-04-20 02:19:11
why are longs so low if it's so obviously bullish and in a new upcycle?  I know all about TA that's why I asked you for even the most simplistic reasoning behind your assertion that that was the bottom and we're in a new upcycle.  
This is all pretty rhetorical because I know you don't know shit, you obviously think you do though. deathcrossed 200EMA on the daily still not breached in fact as of right now the 55ema that deathcrossed it is still repelling btc, log trendline resistance not breached and it's right on the 200ema so gunna be especially difficult to bust, been low volume pumps almost non-stop since the short squeeze that made all the idiots instantly bullish for some unknown reason (pro tip: if you have to rely on margin traders getting squeezed for your rallies you're gunna have a bad time)  Stay safe.
