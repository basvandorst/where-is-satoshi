I don't think you understand OP's post. OP is referring to buy orders.

Yes. Transaction inputs is your reason for the difference. Yes.

With the latest update the vulnerability was close. TBH, this is actually why I prefer the trezor. They found an issue and fixed it immediately. Don't assume your security is impenetrable, prepare and have a program to deal with the issues.

Iv been a redditor longer, so...
Now we can move about our day.

Depends on the amounts, right? Why not private cash transactions under the minimum?  
There are legal ways to minimize tax exposure. Although, we are still having issues reading the latest tax bill draft...lol

Just put it on a paper wallet...

There will be several at least. The ecosystem is better when there is more then one option.

Well if your a miner your shorting, just about everyone else is long. 
Bitcoin and IRA... I still can't get over this concept. Why put it in a IRA when it inherently can't be taxed. Rather save the vehicle for fiat, right?

Insightful. Where can you track stuff like this?

LN is not really intended to be p2p and is not immediately written to the blockchain. You may want to do some additional research. YouTube has some great videos.

Yes, the chip in ledger is technically more secure, but they are just as vulnerable if not more to other (way less novel) attacks then that of the trezor. Why? They didn't prepare for these vulnerabilities from the start. The same point you tried to make on trezor.

What news?

Yes! Love slushpool. They do great work. Imo, this could be the first step in Bitmain losing thier control of the asic market. The effects could be great for the bitcoin community.
