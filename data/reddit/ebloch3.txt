Thanks! We're still in private Alpha, but in the simplest sense it's a robot that manages your finances for you.
I know what you're thinking and yes we overdosed on Science Fiction as children and *cough* as adults :)
Private message me the email you used and I'll get you higher on invite the list.

Yeah like that idea of different exchanges or maybe a blended rate? Just found an easy endpoint to get Bitstamp (
Can you elaborate more on what you mean by "different intervals" not sure I totally follow. Thanks!

Totally makes sense re: exchange. Gonna share with the team.
Got it re: intervals. Without it being that smart yet curious if the ability to just set individual alerts at 800/775/750 would do the same job for you?
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:24:12
Both. So when you submit the price alert request it knows what the last price was and determines if you're asking for it to be greater than or less than i.e. if you submit an alert for 900 and current price is 950 it knows it's "less than".

That's actually really good feedback. Right now it's running off the Mt Gox feed, looking at Last price:

Thanks a lot for surfacing that. Was looking for a good source of a blended rate. bitcoinaverage duh! LOL

We couldn't find a no bullshit, non-spammy, free Bitcoin SMS alert. So over the weekend we hacked one together. Would love any feedback and hope everyone enjoys!

Quick update. We're now using Bitstamp for our prices. 
Also realized I didn't address this before but we have no desire to collect or sell mobile numbers at all. It's not our business or our interest; it's not the kind of people we are (I'm using my real name here). Our sole interest is to build great products. Hope that helps.
