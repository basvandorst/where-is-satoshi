The problem is that 'you guys' often call tax money spent on things you disagree with 'theft' and like to use metaphors of violence to back up that claim. Whereas, if its something you do agree with, like roads, it all of a sudden is not theft, despite the fact that the same exact financing methods are used. Some consistency in your argument might make it more convincing.

You obviously hold a different and more extreme opinion than the person I was responding to, who said "we're not saying we don't want to pay any taxes for anything. There's a grand canyon of difference between paying taxes for roads and firemen and most of the shit the government blows money on nowadays."

That's true, and it's probably best to report it. But I believe there might not be a penalty if you leave it off and the IRS finds it later but there are no taxes due. Here is why I think that:
This happened to me with some stocks that I sold. I forgot to report them when I filed my taxes, but they were all long term capital gains (LTCG) and I was in a very low income bracket, so my LTCG rate was 0%. Two years later, the IRS sent me a CP2000 letter, which is their first step in reaching out when they think you got something wrong on your taxes. They told me about the trades that the brokerage had reported to them and I had left off my tax return. They then 'assumed' that my cost basis was $0, and that they were short-term capital gains (essentially assuming the highest tax burden possible) and told me how much they think I owe them. However, they said if this is incorrect, I just needed to show them evidence of why. So I gave details of the buy/sell price and date, and apologized for forgetting to report. That was the end of the matter.
I am not an accountant, but based on that exchange, I think that is how it would go down if you left those trades off your taxes. Of course, like I prefaced, it's best to report everything.

Yes, and if my mom had wheels she'd be a bicycle. There's pretty much zero likelihood of that happening. China buys US bonds for several reasons. US treasuries are extremely stable, which Bitcoin obviously is not. It prevents the Yuan from appreciating dramatically against the dollar, which is good for Chinese exports. Bitcoin would not do that. And it intertwines the economic destinies of the US and China, which is good for China.
A bankrupt US would pretty much cause a collapse of China. China's government remains in power because of strong economic growth, year over year. If the US stops buying their goods, the Chinese economy, and eventually its political system, falls apart.

That’s not what inherent value is. In fact, it’s pretty much the opposite of what is meant in this context. Inherent value means it has value even if there is no market for buying it directly.

Also, before credit cards, the only options to pay were with cash and checks, and checks had (and still have) some serious drawbacks. 
Credit cards were sort of a first mover. Now that they're entrenched, bitcoin needs some serious benefits over credit cards in order to compete. It's not yet clear to me that it has those, especially given the long delay in confirmation.
I'm still bullish on bitcoin in the long term for other reasons though, mainly online purchases, money transfers, and remittances.

Do you mean a paper wallet? So you are saying as long as it is generated while I am not connected to to the internet, it is entirely secure? What is the benefit of booting from Linux then?

Good point, thanks for the response!
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:46:52
Yes, but...countries with high inflation are also those most likely to ban bitcoin. 
Why?? Because in most cases, the reason inflation is high is because the government uses seigniorage (printing money) to generate most of its revenue. It may be that its really difficult to collect taxes, so instead their "tax" is inflation via seigniorage. It may also be that the government is super corrupt and does not manage its monetary system well. Either way, these governments will not want to turn off the currency spicket by having a portion of the economy based in bitcoin, which is even more difficult to tax.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:35:08
Yes, that's true, but it's a lot harder to regulate black markets where physical money is changing hands than to block (or make it extremely hard to access) bitcoin since all they need to do is censor certain webpages.
Localbitcoin would be an option, but I don't see how that would have any advantage in black markets over physical currencies from other countries like the dollar.
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:29:15
So you're saying it would be possible to compromise the cold storage on a computer by installing software, even if that computer is never connected to the internet? Could you explain? Are you implying there are viruses or malware which are able to transmit information to external sources without using the internet? Or would the virus/malware force the computer to connect to the internet somehow?
And my understanding from what I've read here on reddit is that paper wallets generated from a computer which has been connected to the internet are still not entirely secure. Do you disagree?
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:09:54
Stocks also split because (with some exceptions like dividend reinvestment) you cannot buy partial shares. 7trXMk6z points out that this didn't matter much for Berkshire Hathaway, but in other cases, one could make the argument that this limits wider ownership.
The same case could not be made with bitcoin which can be split to very small fractions.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:41:19
Absolutely agree. In its current state, bitcoin has little to no advantage in these areas. Over time though, as the infrastructure around bitcoin grows, we will probably see services which fill in these gaps for bitcoin.
Regarding remittances, no I don't do that with any frequency, my family lives in the same country as me. But billions of dollars cross borders every year for remittances and enormous fees are captured processing these. In countries where companies like Western Union don't operate (e.g. Somalia) not only are the fees bigger, but there is a huge risk of the money never arriving. 
Having the ability to send money directly to a family member's cell phone would be *life changing* for many people in developing countries.

Dude, stay on topic. I made no comment about what Obama did or did not fix. You’ve got some weird obsession about bringing him up.

I never said this. Show me my quote where i say this please.


Okay but you do realize that Bernanke was nominated by Bush in 2006 right? Obama did reappoint him in 2010 but that was after Quantitative Easing.




Again, I've never said that. I never avoided the question because you never asked it. QE absolutely did create new funds which were bought up by the FED to keep the banks solvent.

This seems like a very flimsy argument. One could imagine a scenario where someone inherits a building full of gold that had been mined generations ago but was horded away and forgotten about. Once that gold is put on the open market, it has the same affect as if it were mined today, and reduces the market price of gold. Is that person more of a thief than the gold mine owner?
This example might seem far-fetched, but replace gold with bitcoin, and it all of a sudden isn't. An early adopter who on a whim bought thousands of bitcoins for next to nothing and forgot all about them could suddenly flood the market. Are they a thief to you?

There is no perfect store of value, but everything is relative. And there are plenty of assets that hold their value better than bitcoin.
Dollars, pounds, and euros hold their value extremely well over short and medium terms. 1-2% inflation is nothing compared to bitcoin volatility. And over long terms, if you put your dollars in a savings account, your value will be extremely stable. Municipal or government bonds are similar. Hell, even holding an index fund of the stock market will hold your value much better than bitcoin over decades.

It's not really better. Is a gold miner that mines gold *stealing* from everyone that holds gold, because the value of their gold is declining?

A) the Federal Reserve did print money with Quantitative Easing. I said that like 4 times. What I’m saying is that it wasn’t Obama. He is not the Federal Reserve. 
B) Nearly every mainstream economist believes that the bank bailout saved the economy from falling over a cliff and was a very good thing. 
C) I share your frustration that the people in charge of the bank’s didn’t get held accountable. I don’t know that Obama should receive all of the blame for that, he surely deserves some of it. At the time the entire Republican Party was foaming at the mouth to call him a socialist. I imagine even if he spoke in favor of jailing bankers, they would have freaked out even more.

The way he arrived at 10 mil is ridiculously stupid though. He said the total value of bitcoin has to equal the total wealth of the world. Except that makes no sense. There is way more wealth than there is currency in the world.
For instance, [net financial assets in the US is $123 trillion]( Meanwhile, [total money supply is $14.5 trillion]( And much of that money supply is held outside of the US, so it shouldn't even count against US assets.
In fact, if we include bitcoin in total wealth calculations, which we absolutely should, it wouldn't make any sense to equate the value of bitcoin to total wealth, because it by definition has to be less (Total wealth=total bitcoin value + total all other asset values).

It's true that its not in the constitution, but Alexander Hamilton, the country's first treasury secretary, contributor to the writing of the constitution, and an author of the Federalist Papers, founded the country's first national bank, a predecessor to the current Fed. So while its not explicit in the constitution (just as none of the executive departments are) it was certainly on the mind of the founders.


Correlation doesn't equal causation. And in fact, the period since the Federal reserve was founded is the most prosperous period in American history. I'm not saying its because of the Fed (although the Fed has certainly helped stabilize the economy), but you also can't say that the reason the US was prosperous in the early 1800s was because the BUS was dismantled.


I'm not sure what this has to do with the Fed. But, we are currently living in the most peaceful time in world history. It may not seem that way, but there have never been so few inter-state and civil wars, and violent deaths are at an all time low. But again, this has nothing to do with the Fed. 


It's not the Fed that allows this, its our corrupt political system. The Fed really has nothing to do with the too-big-to-fail bailouts. Blame the politicians that put weak financial regulations in place both before and after the financial crisis. Blame the Democrats for making the Dodd-Frank bill weak, and then blame the Republicans for weakening it further.

Sorry, but I see much of this thrown around a lot here and it's total bullshit.


The Fed is owned by member banks. It's ownership is neither undisclosed nor private.


The Fed is audited every year by the Government Accountability Office. It's financial statements are also audited annually by an independent auditor and results are given to the Office of the Inspector General, which then releases the results to the public. You can see the 2016 audited financial statements here 
The balance sheet of the Fed is also published every year. Here is the latest: 
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:34:52
No, you again misunderstand. A financial audit looks back into the past at transactions that occurred, and makes sure that the financial statements are correct. This already happens, completely.
Ron Paul's 'audit' is to allow congress to assess these decisions before they are made. It would essentially make the Fed a part of Congress, and would allow the congress to decide what decisions the Fed makes. It is not really an audit, but 'Audit the Fed' sounds good, so that's what he calls it. 
I'm kinda surprised that you could claim to side with Ron Paul, but not really understand what he is pushing for.

If at the end of the transaction, you have the item you purchased, the same amount of bitcoin you started with, and less dollars, then you effectively bought the item with your dollars.
I get how this is a good strategy to get stores to start accepting bitcoin, but its not a long run solution to having bitcoin be a real currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:13:43
You seem to not really understand what Ron Paul's effort was. The audits on the Fed are fully complete. They include every stock that the Fed owns, and every single transaction that the Fed makes. That is what a financial audit is in every sense of the word.
What Ron Paul wanted to do is make every single monetary decision that the Fed makes subject to congressional review, oversight, and pressure. 
I don't agree that that would be a smart thing to do. There is a reason the Fed was set up to be independent of the government- mainly that they didn't want decisions that impact monetary policy to be subject to political pressure. In countries where it is, politicians put pressure on their central banks to, for instance, print massive amounts of money to pay for domestic spending to keep their people happy. Currently if congress wants to do that, they need to increase taxes or take on debt, both of which are politically unpopular. If you think spending is out of control now, imagine what would happen if congress or the executive could just print money on their own, it would be far worse. That's the difference between US fiat and fiat in a country like Zimbabwe, where Mugabe was allowed to print as much as he wanted.

I’m generally optimistic about the promises of bitcoin to offer new payment methods, abilities to store wealth, especially in places with hyperinflation or strict capital controls, and new possibilities for remittances throughout the world. Then I see comments like these and realize a huge proportion of bitcoin’s constituency probably got their understanding of economics from the foreword of an Ayn Rand novel, or from a Ron Paul infomercial on investing in gold. That’s when I reconsider buying the dip.

What he's saying is that why would I pay $10k to buy a bitcoin from you, when I can spend $6.5k on hardware and electricity and mine it myself?
I suspect the answer is that there is a convenience premium and a risk premium which combine to be near 100% of the price at the moment. Buying it yourself is MUCH easier than building a rig and learning how to mine. Most people who hold bitcoin probably have no clue what it means to mine bitcoin and also don't have the background or time or interest to learn about it.
The risk premium is that there is risk in spending money upfront to buy a rig, and then not being able to figure it out, or the price suddenly collapses and you're left with a useless mining rig and no bitcoin, or the halvening happens and all of a sudden it costs $12k on average to mine a bitcoin. Not claiming these are all rational beliefs but that may be what is leading people to buy over mine.

Quantitative easing was a tool to prevent the economy from collapsing. Tell me how it was political? The Fed's dual mandate is to maximize employment and stabilize prices which is what QE was intended to do (and in the opinion of just about every mainstream economist, it accomplished that).
Just because QE is something you have an ideological disposition against, doesn't make it political. Now, if they were to implement QE today, when the labor market has mostly recovered, that would certainly be circumspect. And that would be something you could expect under a Fed that isn't independent. 
Also, you haven't responded to my first point which is that the Fed's ownership is completely transparent and known. You could simply google it.

In some countries I think bitcoin (or similar cryptocurrencies) could be a valid replacement for central banks. The upside with having Bitcoin be a country's currency is exactly like you say it, it's independent of both banks and politicians. The downside is that it would eliminate the ability to tighten or loosen currency to stabilize the labor market when recessions occur. In a country like Zimbabwe, or Venezuela, I think the upsides outweigh the downsides. In the US or the EU, I don't believe that they do.
I see bitcoin's major benefits are as a medium of transaction, more than as a currency. Bitcoin can transfer large amounts of money, almost immediately, for very low cost (usually). The implications that this will have for online payments and remissions across countries could be huge if it goes mainstream. As long as fees stay low, it could also replace credit and debit cards.

You're confusing Keynesian economics with mainstream economics. Keynesian economics is one branch of economics. All mainstream economists believe deflationary currencies are disastrous for economic growth.

I agree with this, but Bitcoin doesn't need to replace the dollar to do this. The dollar and bitcoin can certainly co-exist. The features you list might be the most compelling features for you, and many in this sub, but they are not for me.


I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one.


We clearly have different world views, which there is nothing wrong with. I am not a banker. I am actually an economist. A micro-economist to be specific, so my job has nothing to do with the Fed or with monetary policy at all, but I have an appreciation for its importance. The Fed is certainly an imperfect institution. There is a balance between being politically independent and being accountable that needs to be thread. I think currently it walks that balance as best as possible, with governors appointed by the executive, confirmed by the Senate, and serving long terms, similar to the Supreme Court. I see why turning it all over to an algorithm could be considered desirable, but I also believe in the importance of being able to adjust monetary policy according to the trends in the economy.

For context, the ATM was in a restaurant/bar in a dark hallway leading to the bathroom. There was no advertising from outside the restaurant. I asked the waiter about it and he said the restaurant doesn’t own it but rents the space to the owner. The restaurant itself didn’t even accept bitcoin. He said it is used quite often though.

No because that’s a protected class. And protected for a reason. 
It’s funny you call what I’m calling for fascism. I would say forcing you to do a business transaction with someone you don’t want to do one with is closer to fascism.

Or maybe they understand the tech and disagree with your view of politics. Coinbase is a private company. You are free to love them or hate them, but your personal view of them doesn't matter. It's strange to me that so many people that support bitcoin because of the individual rights it confers to its holders also believe that private businesses should be forced to do business with people they don't want to.
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:25:46
Okay but we’re talking about Coinbase, not google/twitter/etc. So I ask again why you think a private business like Coinbase should be forced to do business with people it doesn’t want to? And why do you think that’s censorship?

Why do you think this is censorship? They are a private business, they control who they do business with. In fact, telling Coinbase that they have to do business with someone they don't want to is also a type of censorship according to your definition.

The anti-discrimination laws are for protected classes- gender, race, nationality, and religion. Maybe a few others I’ve missed. Milo is being ‘discriminated against’ for being a general asshole. That’s not a protected class.


So if I own a business, let’s say a bar. And I refuse to serve Milo because I think he’s an asshole, you believe I am censoring him? Merely because Google and Twitter have also blocked him from their platform?

They have an app and you can take a picture of the check to deposit it. Only problem is they limit it to $1,000/day, so checks over that amount won't work. You can mail those in to their main branch in Tampa, or you can drop it off at one of their trading offices if you live in a metropolitan area (I have done both).

Big funds typically don't buy in all at once. They do it gradually over a few weeks or months so they don't stir the market too much. A smart fund manager would probably create many wallets and only buy a few bitcoins in each so nobody knows they are linked. Then after they are done buying, they announce what they have bought and everyone gets excited and the price jumps.

Except, credit card transactions are not free. True, you may not pay a fee at the time of use, but nearly everything you buy is marked up 3-5% with the assumption that a large majority of people are going to use a credit card to make purchases. That's why department stores offer discounts to people who use their store credit card. Also, I don't know about where you live, but on the east coast there are a lot of gas stations that charge significantly more for credit card purchases than cash. True, bit coins can't be used to pay for gas....yet.
Regarding transaction time, online retailers like amazon or newegg wait sometimes up to an hour or two after you make a purchase before they begin the processing of your order with a credit card. I'm sure many other retailers do the same, but these retailers are explicit about it.
I do agree with you that it is a speculation tool at the moment. Theoretically, this should change once a critical mass of people and retailers buy into the concept. I think security is a big issue at the moment, which is preventing that from happening. Maybe a little gov't regulation akin to what was discussed in the congressional hearings today could alleviate this issue a bit and be a good thing for bitcoin's future. Or maybe not, we shall see.

**This is NOT true**. 
At the very least you could Google things before you post them here and give people mis-information.
Here are the facts:
The long term capital gains tax for people who earned less than $36,250 ($72,500 for joint filers) will remain 0%, as it was last year.
Between $36,500 and $400,000 ($72,500 and $450,000 for joint), the marginal tax rate will remain 15%, as it was last year.
For long term capital gains above $400,000 ($450,000 for joint), the marginal tax rate will increase from 15% to 20%.
I don't know where you get 30% from. Seems like you just made it up.
Furthermore, if you lose your investment, you DO get a tax benefit. Any investment losses can be subtracted from other investment gains to reduce your tax burden. If you ONLY have losses, then no, you do not get a refund from the government. Why should the American people subsidize your risky investment decisions?
Here is a source that backs up everything I described, and contains more information:
The long term capital gains rate is still low compared to historical numbers. In the 1970's, it was nearly 40%. It was lowered during Carter's presidency to 28%, and then lowered again by Reagan to 20%. Before Reagan left office, it was increased back to 28%. It hovered around that number until the end of Clinton's term when it was lowered to 21%. It's only been below 20% since 2003.
Stop making shit up.

There is no analogous scenario in which the US dollar collapses like the ruble. The ruble collapsed because the economic system behind it--communism--collapsed. Price controls vanished over night. Faith in the communist system, and the government which implemented it, which were the only things propping up the currency, vanished overnight.
People that claim that this could happen to the US dollar are either extreme ideologues or alarmists. The worst thing could happen with the dollar is modestly large inflation, in the range of what happened in the 70's. Even that is unlikely.
Even if you don't trust in the economic arguments into why the dollar won't collapse, there's another major reason- the US military. There's a reason why the US dollar is the reserve currency, and it's not just that we have the largest economy. Our Navy is significantly larger than all the world's Navy's combined. We patrol and keep open all the shipping lanes in the world. If we want to prevent a country from trading, we can do it. Think about the implications of that. Most of the oil produced in the world comes from countries which are geopolitical enemies of the US. But still, oil is traded in US dollars. Meaning that if a country wants to buy oil on the open market, it first has to buy dollars. That's no coincidence.  There has only been one attempt by a country to sell oil in a currency other than the US dollar. It was Iraq, in 2000. I'm not saying that's why we invaded Iraq, but no other country has tried since then.

Trading stocks is much easier than buying bitcoins if you're not in the US and can't use a service like coinbase. You can sign up at Charles Schwab, and have an online trading account in 10 minutes. Then it may take a few days to get money into it via ACH transfer, but once that's there, you can buy stocks immediately. Or you could just deposit a cashiers check at a local store and it will clear immediately.
Not trying to sell you on Schwab, a lot of places are like that (e.g. Scott trade), but Schwab is what I know.

According to [Warran Buffet]( there are 171,300 metric tonnes of gold above ground in the world. That's around 6 billion ounces. Let's say gold is trading around USD1,300/ounce. That puts golds "market cap" at approximately USD7.8 trillion.
For comparison, there are about 12 million bitcoins mined (equivalent to above ground gold). At USD750 per bitcoin, bitcoins "market cap" is around USD9 billion.
Thus, if my math is correct, in order to reach parity with gold, one bitcoin would have to be trading at USD650,000 ( (7.8 trillion/9.8 billion)*750).
Bitcoin is no where close to parity with gold...

We literally had segregation in half the US during much of that time period. White only restaurants wouldn’t take money from black people. The same green money. And if you think shops and restaurants didn’t discriminate based on other factors like religion, then you’re delusional. There’s a reason why the civil rights act had to protect certain classes from discrimination. It was actively happening.

1. Between 2009 and 2012 federal taxes were below 16% of GDP. That hasn't occurred since 1950. So I'm not sure what you're talking about regarding the write offs. Yes, there were some write-offs in the past that don't exist today. But there are many new ones that replaced those. The fact is that Americans are paying a lower share of their income in taxes than they have in 2 generations. And don't blame the recession because those figures are a percentage of GDP.
2. How are the marginal tax rates a lie? You consulted CPA's? What does that even mean. Marginal tax rates are FACTS. You can Google them. I posted a source from one of the largest financial managers in the country. Where is yours? 
3. I'm sorry your daddy isn't bringing home that much bacon this year. Not sure what that has to do with the discussion at hand though.
4. I have no clue why you posted a link to Wikipedia, so I will not address that further. 
5. The 30% figure was the major complaint of your post. So thank you for your apology. The other misleading part of your post was the fact that you implied that everyone would be see their taxes increased. That is not true. See point 2.
6. Fine, benefit is the wrong word. The correct word is offset. If you lose $15,000 in bitcoin, but gain $15,000 in some other investment, you pay no capital gains taxes. Why would you expect to get a benefit? Do you want to subsidize the gambling losses of everyone that goes to Las Vegas? I think not.
7. Am I correct to assume when you wrote 'lamens' you meant 'layman's'? Let's assume I am. I fundamentally disagree with your characterization of where our tax dollars go. I enjoy many of the benefits having a functioning government provides with my tax dollars, even though they aren't functioning as well as they should right now (and please don't accuse me of being a 'taker' or something, I do not receive any government benefits aside the benefits of living in a first world country that all Americans enjoy). Of course, there are many aspects of the government budget I would change if it were up to me . I suspect this will be any area we will not find common ground on, so perhaps we can agree to disagree?
