Let's go over [the list](
- Voter registration
- Purges of voter lists
- Voter suppression
Not solved by coin-voting.
- Practical impediments
Easily solved by adding resources.
- Voting machines
Solved by using pen and paper.
- Provisional and absentee ballots
Not solved by coin-voting.


I'm stating that you can't get a receipt proving who you voted for. Even if you take a picture of your ballot, you can always get a new one from election officials. You haven't yet stated how to get a receipt with a pen-and-paper system.
@_date: 2014-01-06 10:05:03
But you can still sell your vote by giving away your address (or even the private key) prior to the election. The buyer can then confirm that you voted correctly by looking in the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:34:03
In a private election, you still want to be able to confirm *how many* voted for a candidate, but not the identity of the voters. How do your system satisfy both those conditions?
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:16:55
By doing that, you lose the whole verifiability-aspect of using coins for voting. How would an outsider verify how many votes a candidate has?
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:22:59


Why rely on that when we already have a system that makes it impossible? With such a serious vulnerability, why even use the system?
@_date: 2014-01-06 10:07:18
True. That sounds like a solution in search of a problem, though.

There are big unsolved problems with using a Bitcoin style system for elections, and you mentioned one of them. People should not be able to see who you voted for, even if you want them to. That would make it possible to sell votes, and to extort people into voting for a candidate.
It also doesn't stop rigged elections unless you know exactly how many people are supposed to vote.

Tax evasion is illegal. But since Bitcoin isn't a currency, this would not be evading taxes, just avoiding them. (I am not an accountant).

It still makes it possible to prove who you voted for, thereby providing a receipt to the person who bought your vote. A pen+paper ballot doesn't have that problem.

Impossible to tell. It has survived a bursting bubble (price went to $30, then $2, currently at $11). That tells me there might me something there.
With any currency, it's seldom a good idea to invest in them long term. Sewing dollar bills into your mattress almost guarantees you a loss (because of the nature of Bitcoin, this may not apply to them. It will, however still be a risk in the long term).
Using them as a trading instrument is different, though. You can sell and buy as you need them, and keeping only a low amount helps minimizing any potential losses.

This is not true, an attacker would need to know both your GD password AND your TC password (and your Multibit password).
The biggest security hole is, imo, your computer getting infected by malware. That would bypass both GD and TC completely, and they only need to keylog your MB pass.
My recommendation would be to just skip the truecrypt step, and focusing on having a strong password on your wallet.

Thanks a lot for taking your time explaining your issues. It's good to see a fresh view on things, especially in this relatively closed circle.

**Now for some answers:**
0: A web-based bitcoin client can be almost as safe as one running on your computer. Any private data is stored encrypted and is only decrypted in your browser, via javascript.
1. Damn, that's a tough one
2. Well, a wallet is a collection of public/private keys (public keys are also known as addresses). Normally, you would create a new pair every time you wanted to receive money. This increases anonymity, and makes it easier to keep track of when people pay you (If you give one address to Mike and another to Bill, you can see which one paid you without knowing their address.  
Some wallets are "Deterministic". This means that from just a start code you can create an unlimited number of keypairs.  
The last thing about wallets is, many bitcoin clients allows you to label the addresses you give away, making it easier to keep track of your income.  
So, to backup/export your wallet, you need either a collection of public/private keys **or** a deterministic wallet seed **and optionally** your list of address/label pairs.
3. To see how much money you have, you only need the blockchain and the addresses you want to check. Since people use multiple addresses, it's not possible to know how much money they have.

He's saying that your references lie. If an encryption key is sent while it's being made, it's visible using wireshark. If it's saved for later, it's visible in the filesystem.  
They probably have backdoor programs ready to deploy to any computers they want, but it's not default in any sane, open OS.
And saying the you "made an enormous breakthrough" is classic fud. No real information is given, so their breakthrough could be anything.

I think jesset77 means that if you're infected with malware, the malware can patch your bitcoin app. And then the next time you do a transaction, the patched app will send all your money to an attacker instead of what you asked it to.

My point is, if there were a working tax system in 1920, how would Bitcoin prevent that from happening in 2020?
In 1920, you could bury your gold-based cash in a secret spot, and it could only be voluntarily taxed. Almost nobody did, because they preferred a working society with infrastructure, a police force, a government and an army.
The same has been true in 1820, 1720, 1220, 20 and -280

It is not a failure. If everyone went to jail for evading taxes, the system would collapse. But if only a small percentage do it, the system will work as expected, and the punished will be shown off as deterrence.
I agree that putting people in prison is not useful to society. But as a society, we need to live by a set of common rules. And prison is one way of forcing people to follow the rules. Other ways include economic sanctions, seizure of property, violence, mutilation and murder.

If you could buy bitcoin with cc, here's how to steal a lot of money:
Pickpocket a credit card. take out your smartphone, jump on the nearest unsecured wifi network. Buy bitcoin. Throw credit card away, or even return it.
The only way to get caught is red-handed, with your hand in their pocket. And even then, there is only evidence of one occurrence of pickpocketing. 
Instead of pickpocketing, the criminal can also use a keylogger, which could also get Paypal credentials.
The pickpocketee might get his money back, but then the bank would have a loss. The bank would naturally freeze whatever payments they had to the bitcoin merchant, thereby making the merchant eat the loss. The merchant can't do anything, because there is no chargeback on Bitcoin.
Basically, the potential for fraud is too big, and whoever exchanges between chargeback-able and non-chargeback-able payment methods is going to get abused.

I haven't heard if any problems (nor any successes). Before you start your experiment, be sure that you follow their rules exactly, so they can't use that as an excuse to dump you.
I don't think they will dump you for using Bitcoins, because:
- It's a very small niche for them (although you may win some loyal Bitcoin nerds).
- It may well be against monopoly laws (but that might be tricky, as the Bitcoin network is not owned by anyone).

Yes it is - deterrence by enforcement.  
Why else would they enforce the law?


We all know Bitcoin *can* be used for illegal activities. Therefore, understanding how the Bitcoin system works is, and should be, a priority for any police force.
If someone blackmailed you and demanded you pay in bitcoin, you'd probably report it to the police. The police starts investigating and needs any clues they can get, including what the blockchain says, relay points, etc. If bitches don't know about my Bitcoin, they are not as effective in solving crimes.

Tracing Bitcoin is no harder than tracing cash, and governments have done that for thousands of years. If they want your money, they can jail you until you pay up.   
Even before Bitcoin, it was easy to keep tax away from government by burying gold in a secret spot. Why don't people do that? They either:
1. Recognize that taxes are not inherently evil, and are necessary in order to have a functioning society.
2. Don't value their anarchistic values enough to endure jailtime for tax evasion.

The state sends one satoshi to every voter. The voter sends that satoshi to the candidate of their choice. That satoshi can be traced from state -&gt; voter -&gt; candidate. 
It's called colored bitcoins.
Not a good idea for voting, because:  
- you can sell your vote and use the blockchain as a receipt.
- the state would have to have a database over everyone's bitcoin addresses, and after the election they can match that against the blockchain and see who voted what.
- starting and maintaining that database is a great hassle.

Making a two-factor app on your desktop would not heighten security.
The problem is that if your computer gets infected with malware, anything you can do, the malware can do. 
You need some trusted hardware of some kind (a PC with malware is obviously not trusted).
The Offline transaction functionality of [Armory]( gives some interesting possibilities to create a cheapish hardware solution, just big enough to sign a transaction. I'm thinking a microprocessor, a small text display and a couple of buttons. When you want to send money, you start an offline transaction in Armory, then send it to the small unit. The bitcoin address and amount is displayed, and you can accept/reject the transaction, then send them back to the computer.
You could also use a smartphone for the above, but that would just move the vulnerability from the pc to the phone (Although I assume the security on phones is somewhat better).

1. It's only about the way the addresses are printed. Just like you can express a number in base2 (binary), base10 (decimal) or base16 (hexadecimal), you can use base58. You can use any representation your client supports, but base58 is by far the most common. In fact, i'm not sure any client supports alternative representations.
Edit: obligatory car analogy. Your car's speedometer may show your speed in 68.4 mph or 110 km/h (or even 30.56 m/s). But it's just different ways of talking about the speed, the physical speed is the same.

If you skipped bitpay as middleman, you can make a link without amount. just use bitcoin:someaddress in an html tag, or bitcoin:someaddress?amount=0.02

I'm not entirely sure what you want. There is a [two-party escrow system]( though it's still experimental.
Simplified explanation: each party gets one half of a private key, and the bitcoin address for the key. The payer pays the agreed upon cash, and the payee checks the address. When the payer has confirmed that everything is in order, he gives up his half of the key (or the payee gives up his half).  
If nobody gives up, the money is lost. 
Not for technologically impaired, but with a better user interface, it could become a thing.

The online wallet on blockchain (well any online wallet) has one extra vulnerability compared to desktop wallets, but it can easily be corrected with a [browser plugin](
Explaination of the vulnerability:  
An online wallet service stores your wallet in encrypted form, and your wallet is only decrypted on your machine, in your browser. If hackers gain access to blockchain.info, they can't see your wallet. But they might be able to change the site so that the next time you log on, your wallet password is sent to the bad guys.
The browser plugin checks the blockchain.info side every time you visit, and warns you if something changed.
tl;dr if you install a plugin, online wallets are as safe as desktop wallets.

They aren't stupid enough to delete the private keys. And they may not sell bitcoin at MtGox, but there's no reason they couldn't put them up at a police auction, and then transfer the bitcoin to the buyer.
They have already transferred all bitcoin from the seized accounts to their own, so any hard disks are no more worth than any other used disks.

Since the network is new, there is an additional charge of 0.01 NMC, in addition to the tx fee (0.005NMC, same rules as Bitcoin). This is to discourage hoarding, and the additional fee will decrease over time.

I'm really having a hard time describing it in any simpler terms than I just did, but I'll try.
For the sake of simplicity, don't worry about difficulty, it doesn't change anything anyway. Also remember that, to a standard client, there are no "good" and "bad" blocks, only the attacker knows the difference. And lastly, forks in the network appear all the time, they are not indicators of anything bad going on.


No. With a 51% attack, the bad will eventually catch up. It's a statistical certainty. 


When both the good and the bad guys start building from the same block, the bad guys will eventually win by having the longest block. Even when the good guys are 20 blocks ahead, the bad guys would catch up eventually and invalidate all good blocks (because they are no longer part of the longest chain).
@_date: 2013-01-01 12:59:51


With a 51%-attack, you can make sure no other blocks are in the blockchain. Example:
(Blocks are denoted with a b for bad or a g for good).
Block A(b) is made. A random miner make block B(g), with A as parent.
Block C(b) is also made with A as parent, and block D(b) with parent C.   
Now block B is orphaned, and every standard miner should make blocks with parent D. The cycle starts over. 
Standard miners could look for blocks with no transactions if an attack was expected, but an attacker could evade that by using its own inconsequential transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:41:25


The admin for pool A makes a program that acts like a proxy between miner X and pool B. The program runs on A's server and connects to B's pool like any other miner would. It gets work units from B and sends them along to X. X can't tell the difference between a normal A work unit and a work unit that came from B, because the work unit just writes the bitcoin address of who should get the reward.
The miner sends back all the solutions to its work unit which matches the difficulty defined by the pool. This difficulty is a lot lower than the network difficulty, so the pool can see how much work its miners are doing. The proxy program would relay most of these solutions to B, but not the ones that would actually award B a block reward.
If the proxy program was responsible for 10% of pool B's total hashrate, every miner at pool B would see a 10% reduction in revenue. It would now be a better deal for miners to join A than B.
