Not for the coin toss. The important detail is that each toss is independent, meaning each toss doesn't affect the probability of the outcome of the next toss. A counterexample to that, dependent events, would be drawing colored marbles from a bag. If you had 3 marbles in a bag, 2 red and 1 blue, and you wanted to know the probability of drawing a red marble on the second draw, the drawing of the second marbles' probability depends on what you drew on the first.  
So if you put 100 marbles in a bag, 50 red and 50 blue, the probability of drawing a red ball on the 1st draw is 50/100, or 1/2. If, against all odds, you drew 49 red balls in a row, the probability of drawing the last red ball is 1/51. Similarly, the probability of drawing a red ball on the 2nd draw would be 49/99 (slightly less than 1/2).  
The coin toss can be converted to the marble analogy, if after you drew the red marble, you put it back in the bag before you drew the next one. So on any given draw, there are always 100 marbles in the bag, 50 red and 50 blue, and the probability of drawing either color would always remain 1/2. It's always resetting to the initial draw, and that's where the memoryless property applies.  
Card games have dependent events, that's why things like card counting works.

It's not missing the trees, this is exactly why it's called the gamblers fallacy. There's a mathematical proof for it based on set theory.  
The probability of getting another head after already getting 50 heads happens in a universe where 50 heads have already occurred. You're not dealing with the entire sample space of all permutations of 51 flips. The subset of permutations you're dealing with is either 51 heads, or 50 heads and 1 tails.  
Breaking it down into a smaller problem, if we're talking about 3 coin tosses, there's 8 possible outcomes. So the probability of any single outcome is 1/8.

If you toss the coin once, and it comes up heads the next set of probabilities breaks down into only a subset of what can occur since any set starting with tails is no longer possible. The odds of any of the remaining combinations is 1/4.

If you toss the coin again and it comes up heads, the possible outcomes shrinks again, this time to only ones where heads occurs as the first two flips. The final odds ends up being 1/2.  
HHH  
HHT  
After 50 heads already occurs, you're in a universe where the probability of the first 50 flips beings heads is 100%. Probability of outcomes is essentially the outcome you want, against all possible outcomes. So if you bet tails on the 51st flip, there are only two outcomes, you've already branched away from the universe where all of the 2\^51 outcomes were possible.
