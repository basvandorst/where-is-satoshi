Yes. If they say that they're going to steal you money it's still a scam. Though a scam is usually due to social engineering where the scam operator forces the other person (or make them feel forced) to hand over the money or a way to get the money.

Can we possibly remove bitfinex.com from the list of places you can buy Bitcoin as some members are currently stating their recent actions as being a little scammy.

No, then the mining would either become unprofitable. Or my 0.2 BTC would be worth over $1 million. And a point would be reached where the market cap of Bitcoin will be heigher than the total fiat value in existance of all currencies (which is an impossibility). 
If it becomes unprofitable to mine, it becomes centralised (with only people like university students and professor's mining it on an old computer and no competition as they have free internet and power). 
Though It's odd that a block wasn't found for over 1 hr and 30 minutes

Dr Craig Wright! That's the only person I can think of for having that amount - haha!
(If they do manage to get 1 million/btc then the value goes up temporarily)

Well doubling the limit is going to do nothing! So the OP is actually nonsense, not my idea. Though my idea is not great, we could always increase the limit to something like 10mb or even 100mb!

Though it would make the initial syncronization of bitcoin wallet faster, I think you've missed the idea that: if we increase the blocksize limit, we increase the time taken for transactions ot be made! 
I don't think changing from a 1mb limit to a 2mb limit would do very much! If we changed it to a 1GB limit then, that might work. It may also reduce the transaction speed, but not by much. Though 1GB is quite extreme, If we increase the reward to 200BTC, then that will counter it!

Who doesn't know this?
A block is released around every 60 seconds, is verified by the miners, and is then relayed back to the server and the bitcoin clients. This porcess is stated by blockchai.info to be an average time of 10.43 minutes.

Ohhh, this is with people who don't follow the general rules of Bitcoin and is evident in the attack last year of "double spending" due to some nodes being manipulated to use different rules than those that are default or normal protocols to follow (which is what needs improving in order to stop the crashes of the Bitcoin value).

I feel it may crash soon as a problem of more attacks on the network and more flaws found. But once these are removed and found, Bitcoin price will yet again increase. I think $10000 will be reached by 2020.

I don't understand what the problem is here? Segregated Witness has already been activated as far as i understand it. The only people that have a problem with "transaction malleability" are ones who set transaction fees to be too low. There's a simple option, set yourself good TX fee rates (only needing a maximum of 4000sat/KB in order to get a fast transaction. Or use coinbase where the transaction fees are paid for by them.

There was the "double spend" issue that required merely a soft fork to fix last year. I think that a similar flaw will be found and corrected much like that one. Although, the Bitcoin developers continue to do a great job so any problem can be fixed quickly.

On the note of varying times that blocks take. I have been interested Bitcoin for about 1.5 years. I've seen one block take 90 minutes to confirm and one that I think took 4 minutes to confirm! Quite far from the averages. But they average out each other quite well.
