But the letter is self-refuting. It's claim is that Bitcoin is superior due to network effects. Yet the proponents of Bitcoin claim that it is superior to Fiat *despite* Fiat's network effects. So with Bitcoin, it is better than altcoins despite technical inferiority, yet also simultaneously better than Fiat despite non-technical inferiority. 
Which is it? Is network effect more important, or technical superiority? Either way, Bitcoin is inferior to something according to this letter.

There's no coercion in a Ponzi scheme.

Bitcoin has fluctuated by 35% against the $ in both directions, just this past week.
By comparison, over the past *month*, the Euro has fluctuated by 1.66% against the $, and the Pound has fluctuated 1.47%.
Bitcoin isn't just volatile, it's explosively volatile.

In this instance they weren't actually within the same market. They were only valid in specific markets due to legal restrictions. Once those restrictions lifted only one currency remained. They would be competing currencies if all three could be used at every store.

Yeah, bandits and pollution are a pretty effective check on overpopulation. Keeps the demand at a more efficient level.

Ironically, that graph is why Bitcoin could never function as a primary currency. Deflation is a bitch.

Currency is a natural localized monopoly. It's very rare for there to be competing currencies within any local market, outside of rare fringe examples like Arcade tokens. It's simply easier and more efficient for a few specialized vendors to manage all currency exchanges and everyone else to trade in a single currency. There are simply too many transaction costs associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a single locality.

First, it's not that nobody will spend them. It's that it lowers the *marginal* *propensity* *to* *consume*, and thus lowers overall demand over a long timeline, depressing investment.
Second, the biggest issue is the instability, not the deflationary character. The rapid increases and decreases in pricing are fine while bitcoin is small and niche, but it would play hell with administrative costs and overhead if it were ever used as a major currency.

Well, yeah, it's a Japan Government problem, but it affects the Japanese economy greatly. And, despite what you may think, the broader economy has a pretty large effect on individuals.
