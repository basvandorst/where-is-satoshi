Ha, I got my decimal places mixed up... 14 cents to $1.40 for a joke, that'll teach me!

Honestly, I think a site like this is a good idea. You can be informal, silly, and have an edge (I dislike "rude" in general) while also making things readable from both a spelling/grammatical standpoint as well as a design one (the red and purple links are awful on the eyes). Thinking about it, I'd like to see something like this succeed, so will be the change I want to see and post some topics. Thanks for the big money! :)

Your site looks immature. If you're going to post a bunch of stuff yourself, make the topic titles provocative but not silly, give some context, use capital letters where appropriate (I), and proofread them (a kid with "on" arm?). 
I posted a picture of a "hot chick" for you, but that topic also reeks of immaturity. I just did it for the Satoshis while watching House of Cards. 
Good luck with the site.

I bought drinks for the bar and set people up with Changetip and Coinbase accounts. All tips from Twitter paid forward and no snark at all. People were really curious about it. Had a great time out watching!

Wow, I just learned from this thread that you can make your own tip amounts and that's awesome! Here's 1 leah mcgrath goodman @_date: 2014-11-25 22:21:00
I'd love to see Ellen DeGeneres. She's often on the cutting edge, moves fast on current stuff. She is Internet savvy.  was on her show the day after that trending tag happened. [EllenTube]( is great. She has a HUGE audience. She often books up-and-coming bands first. She could do a special bitcoin dance! I love that she's always herself, and doesn't seem to care what anyone else thinks. And she's smart. I can totally see her understanding the technology. 
Her ability to go viral is amazing and proven...just ask Samsung about that Oscar selfie!

$15 to ship a coin via USPS?! C'mon that is stupid.

I came here for the r/buttcoin link but there wasn't one. Congrats on your new TV, OP!

Their correction needs... A correction.

Hope Google soon follows suit and adds BTC pricing in Google Now, conversion tools, etc. Not many people have Bloomberg terminals; everyone has Google.

"Bitcon for remittance"
They need a copyeditor.

I just sold some of my vintage receivers for bitcoin on craigslist! Scanned some QR codes while spinning a few tunes, worked out great and I got one of my fellow audio hoard, er, collectors interested in crypto.

Is this how to get a changetip account funded a bit? Just amazing around here.

Great comment and link. If I were a high-ranking government official, I'd recommend pouring money into bitcoin and state-sponsor some mining operations and chip dev/research. North Korea or China could make the Sony hack look like nothing with just a few billion.  Warren Buffett might not like Bitcoin, but it's a market ripe for someone with his bucks. The bottom line is that a takeover (NKoreaCoin, Buffcoin) is entirely possible for anyone who has enough money. Part of me wonders if this is maybe why Satoshi has retained a huge stash. Some sort of insurance?
Whatever happens, it's going to be a very interesting couple of years. 
That article really got me thinking, thanks again.

His name is Lloyd Dobler, dammit. Which is a GREAT name.

I think he has retained control over a large portion of the coins to guard against disaster. It just doesn't make sense to get rid of them--based on his writing he seems like a very deliberate and cautious person with some real political concerns. Should governments get into this and he has in fact held on to the coins, they will eventually have to deal with him and his stash. Insurance against tyranny. Hopefully they don't just take him out.

I am going to try more! 
After I signed up, the confirmation page heading said "Check Our Mail" and I'm thinking maybe that should be "Check Your Mail" instead?

Seriously, people are shocked at this from him? It's a troll, guys... and that's how they get fed.

Looks like traffic was a bitch back then too.
