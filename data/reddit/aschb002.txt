Keiser is the true bitcoin Jesus

Why would you tell him to invest at an ATH? If you’ve hodl for at least a year you should know that whenever Bitcoin hits a high it falls dramatically and then resurges.

My best friend thinks it's a fad and a textbook bubble.  I tried to explain to him that  it's the underlying blockchain tech that gives it value but he wouldn't budge.

If Bitcoin keeps splitting after every proposed upgrade people will be even more hesitant to place their money into it.  If this keeps happening expect a death by a thousand cuts.

One person said it was a bubble but I said that not everything that has the characteristics of a bubble becomes a bubble.  I then went on to explain the value of the block chain and how it's really popular in Korea, Japan, India, and China.

Sadly my litecoin and ethereum are not taking part in the Bitcoin rally.  People must be dumping them and buying Bitcoin

Especially hodl my litecoin and ethereum.  I'm expecting these to take off by the end of the year.

Remember health is wealth.  I feel sorry for the op but I suspect many on this sub are relatively young and need to learn that choices made when you're young will affect you down the road.  I'd hate to make a fortune off my crypto holdings and then have to deal with health problems.  Remember don't drink, smoke, or live a sedentary lifestyle and you'll be paid huge dividends down the road.

I laughed at that too I think it was a typo...

I'd buy right before the fork because with the FUD associated with 2x the price will probably plummet by at least $1500.

History is written by the victors.  If the fork happens and the 2x coin becomes the dominant Bitcoin then the people who didn't support it will be known as the losers.  People will say doubling the blocksize isn't a big deal even without replay protection and the people on r/Bitcoin are nothing but intransigent ideological extremists who want to blow something up when they don't get their way.

Jamie Dimon is a dotard

Sessions is a puppet of big finance and business and these entities are starting to get scared of Bitcoin. Expect a war on bitcoin soon.

I think Bitcoin has the potential to be a revolutionary game changer but I think infighting will destroy it.  The community has shown an inability to work together to effectively scale Bitcoin and I feel there will be dozens of Bitcoins in the near future.  People outside of this sub have already voiced concerns over the splitting and won't invest in something so unstable.  I saw the writing on the wall in August with bcash and lost all hope.

Stupid move.  The price will crash by at least a grand before the November fork debacle.  I predict it will go as low as 3000.

I'll use my earnings to never work again and buy land in northern MN and live as a hermit on a lake with 2 cats and a dog.  I'd love to do nothing but read and play guitar and walk around the north woods.

Just what I thought...  They'd be sued out of business if they went ahead just with the 2x coin.
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:48:25
Umm yeah a big movement down by at least a g before the November hard fork debacle.

The WSJ is a corporatist rag propping up the status quo and BAU.  Nothing insightful or far-sighted ever comes from that publication.
