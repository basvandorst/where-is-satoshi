Looks interesting.  Breadwallet is what I currently use but you've added some functionality that I've been after.  I'll check it out when I get home.
Just one observation; you have some minor formatting and spelling/grammar errors on your website.  Some might argue that it isn't important, but I feel it detracts from the message you're trying to put forward.
Good luck!

That's terrible! How were you hacked?

What's the difference and advantages/disadvantages  between an exchange vs non-exchange?
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:37:53
Thanks. Exactly what I was after.

Thanks. Their buy price is $10 lower than btrade.

You're spot on there. Do you know of anywhere that doesn't charge GST?
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:27:25
How are you making payments to circle? They won't accept Australian bank accounts or credit cards. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:28:53
Ah. Thanks. I'm guessing they don't charge GST?  I thought I read somewhere that they're now headquartered in the Isle of Man.

I've got an NAB account too. How did you link your debit card?

If losing your holdings were to cause you considerable grief/ loss of sleep then invest in a hardware wallet. 
I have a Trezor which gives me complete peace of mind; though a Ledger would work just as well. 
Seriously, pony up the money. You'll be glad you did. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:20:32
Trezor. Hands down.

What bitcoin debit card gives the best exchange rate in your opinion? I read that uquid uses bitstamp's spot price. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:35:25
Ah, great. Thanks for the explanation.

I never found an Australian seller/exchange which accepted PayPal or credit card due to the chance of charge backs/fraud. Though I can't blame them. 
That being said, I've never had a problem with depositing money with an Australian exchange. I've used both btcmarkets and coinjar. 
If you wanted/needed to avoid bank transfers, localbitcoins.com would be your best bet, though you generally will pay a premium over the exchange rate. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 10:58:14
Try coinjar.

I'd be more interested in your trading over the past two weeks with the corrections and bear traps. If you can prove/ show a system whereby you profited just as much as during the bull run I'd be impressed and would probably buy your ebook. 
However, if your trading system is so robust why wouldn't you just purchase a bot, program it with your trading rules, and continue making profit?  If I had a foolproof trading scheme I'd be keeping it to myself.

Then how do I pay off my mortgage and not generate a capital gains event genius?  I bet you're really fun at parties; evangelising about bitcoin then wonder why people politely smile and turn the other way to converse with 'normal', and probably better looking, people.  
But thanks for the advice. Now let me return the favour with a tip for life: just leave people alone. They'll work out what's best for them. You might even make a friend or two.

Just something else to take into consideration, when all your previous posts are shilling fake IDs you'll find that it's hard for people to take you seriously, particularly with something as complex as a trading system. 
Could you provide an example of some of your trades and the analysis behind them?
