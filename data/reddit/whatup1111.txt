All he said in that video was about they were liquid in cash or not, mtgox had withdrawal delays with cash but no problems with bitcoin. They had cash liquid but banks were limiting them, there was no delays in bitcoin during that time (7 months before they closed) But I understand you try to spin it

if its only valuable because someone values it then it doesnt have intrinsic value

He wasnt smug lol, he was just stating the fact that they were financially liquid. Unrelated to the fact they lost their btc later

@_date: 2019-07-16 01:22:20

Nothing has intrinsic value

BTC value once all sold wouldnt be 150B. 50M will easily inflate the market cap by 5-10B depeding on how aggressive they buy

There is no names attached to wallets unless exchanges etc give out people names

Buying/selling at an exchange is instant. Its sending transactions between wallets that take time.
