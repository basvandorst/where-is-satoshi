Maybe a noob question, but where is your data stored? There is no central server, so do all nodes have all the data, including the images and such?

It is counted throughout the whole network. Suppose I had 100M $ and moved it from one address to my other, that would also be counted. So it is not really a fair count IMO.
@_date: 2014-10-29 09:14:45
is this the daily amount? And all transactions, or just transactions of blockchain.info users?

Jeez, do some searching on google. Is it that hard?

Isn't this a long term problem for miners, in the future their main income would be fees. However, with the lightning network a lot will happen off-chain. So there will be less and less miners, this will harm the security of bitcoin.

Kraken locked my bitcoin deposit because it exceeded my daily limit.
My daily limit: 2k$
Deposit: 4Bitcoin.
so apparently 4bitcoin now is more than 2k? I wish.
After 3 days it cleared, with an apology, so at least they fixed it.
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:12:28
Ah, so the genesis block is blaock  not 
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:00:28
I get the point, but this goes against the whole purpuse of bitcoin. You still need a middleman and coinbase can peek on everything you purchase or sell.
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:39:23
what is so great about this? Yet another exchange. 
People bitching about illiquidity, how is bitstamp not liquid enough.
@_date: 2015-01-11 11:14:48
the problem is the deposit, how will I be able to do a deposit if I don't own any bitcoin. I have to buy this deposit on another exchange beforehand, and keep that as long as I trade. Through that period I have to accept the consequences of volatility. So IMO not the best solution.

I think I get it. So this empty block is an additional block mined in the time they were parsing, this is done so no computing power is wasted. But where is their original block (the block they were parsing)?

BtcDirect is a little bit more expensive, but at least it works, thanks for the hint.

fk Ripple
@_date: 2015-04-14 11:52:34
Ah thanks, I think I get it. When you create a 'new' address, you basically get the next unused one in the chain. But importing a private key would be different indeed.
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:14:53
You are saying that I should fake my info? I could do that but the point is, that they are asking for it.
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:22:36
I don't understand. You can sweep the private keys with one transaction right, so once the first person has done that no transactions will be added?
@_date: 2015-09-13 08:01:21
Doesn't fill or kill encourage double spending?

@_date: 2015-09-25 17:16:47
I don't want to disappoint you but the ltc halving did not really have an effect on the hashrate nor on the price. So I would not expect anything different from btc.

I bought something for 1 bitcoin yesterday when it was almost 500$, by the time I released escrow the price was back to 400$. Haha, seller  (no darknet, just regular stuff)
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:15:39
XD, misread that lol.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:23:29
So coinbase has become a 'bitcoin bank'? Seriously, what is the advantage of this over a regular credit card?
@_date: 2015-11-21 00:35:07
I see, it has some advantages I guess. changing from (exchange to bitcoin when needed) to (change to fiat when needed).
@_date: 2015-11-11 13:01:50

@_date: 2015-11-10 19:29:42
What if the double spend is more rewarding than the block reward?
@_date: 2015-11-16 10:30:01
Suppose you have a large amount of black coins. Now spread them over many addresses, tumble them mutiple times. Send small bits to exchanges and cash out (via bittrex or so, no verification needed)... stuff like that. By then so many addresses are tainted that blacklisting will only hurt regular users. So blacklisting will be useless.
@_date: 2015-11-16 17:51:53
I don't understand what you mean? You want to have tainted outputs since there is no other way of getting rid of tainted coins.
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:57:20
If i generate a seed, but later add an address I would have to create a new seed right? There would be no way for the old seed to 'know' about the new address.
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:52:41
But in my example there would also be a path from B to D right. You wouldn't know for sure where the bitcoin from D originated from?
@_date: 2015-11-20 21:52:02
That is true. But I suppose you have to have your coins in your coinbase account, then coinbase is in control, not me.
@_date: 2015-11-05 12:11:06
@_date: 2015-10-31 13:18:42
lol, good luck bro
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:28:14
How fair is the conversion rate? Do you lose 1%, 5% or maybe 20%?
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:28:30
Can you follow one specific coin? Or are coins indistinguishable? Let's say I have Send 1 bitcoin from A to B, and 1 from C to B. Then I take out 1 bitcoin from C to D. Will this bitcoin in address D be the one from A, B or mixed, or is there no way to tell?
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:08:13

These irregularities concern me. On a smoothed average everything looks fine, months, maybe years untill all blocks are full. But there are spikes of a facter 2 or 3 that are the problem.

Thanks for the hint, however I am mostly selling indie games for which the order book is quit slim/non existent. On g2a I have to advantage of publicity... at the cost of a lot of fees. I think I lose 30% of my TURNOVER because of fees, not just profit, turnover!
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:38:59
This is assuming you want to send it in a single transaction. When I am buying several items there is just a 15 minute time window in which I can pay for coinbase/bitpay. So I cannot stack 100 purchases, and then pay.
@_date: 2015-10-20 20:13:36
It was already up and running for 2 years, just re-branded. Maybe it was just a temporary error.
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:09:41
I am definitely interested, I will look into it again when it releases.
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:30:19
They are getting better, as a seller they ask me regularly for proof of purchase, this basically rules out points 3 &amp; 4 that were pointed out by AlyoshaV.
@_date: 2015-10-23 19:17:07
Yes, I know. But how does that enable you to spend the coins? 
@_date: 2015-10-17 11:05:43
Wow, why don't gift card owners sell those? Just letting them expire is a waste.
@_date: 2015-10-31 23:30:26
Yes, up to about 3 in a row. After that it doesn't broadcast the transaction anymore. Unless you wait for a confirmation ofcourse. However, veqtrus' hint already worked: put coins into different addresses in the same wallet.
@_date: 2015-10-17 12:12:16
Yes, name, address, and dna samples ofcourse. That is just part of the routine.

"what's going on?", you must be new to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:31:08
You have to click pay with g2a pay, and then select bitcoin in the next menu. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:18:43
They have you and your trezor, and try to send a transaction to their address. If it doesn't work they torture you till you give them all the passwords.

Select pay with g2apay, and then within g2apay select bitcoin. Hopefully you can withdraw with bitcoin soon too.

They basically had to since their biggest competitor g2a did.
@_date: 2015-10-28 23:45:36
So how are those exchanges making money if they don't charge fees? Only withdrawal fees I think.
@_date: 2015-10-17 12:04:51
That is actually very good business for amazon. But in the future, you could try selling them on kinguin/g2a/ebay. Maybe openbazaar in the future.

So you cannot spend the bitcoin before a certain block even when you have the private key. That is interesting, so what has changed after a certain block is published so that you can spend the coins?
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:44:44
Here in Europe we have Sepa transactions which are free (Europe to Europe only). That includes most digital transactions I do, so it is really hard to convince people here to start adopting bitcoin as it doesn't give them an immediate advantage. Nowadays I just keep it to myself. Best I can do is just try to spend bitcoin whenever possible to stimulate the use of it.
@_date: 2015-10-08 18:34:44
I am also looking forward to that :)
@_date: 2015-10-01 09:16:40
So you participate in tumbling coins, is that legal?

Reseller here, I hoard games whenever they are on sale: steam/gmg/humblebundle/... . Check out However, you cannot buy them in bulk so you have to buy them one by one. Pretty boring, but as long as it is profitable it is oke.
