Did you get your money out of it? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:16:57
Oh boy....

Who is talking about banking anymore? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:43:11
I'm also not selling!
Not that I think it would be worth it and buy back cheaper.
I always miss the bottom and sell too late. I'm to bad at this game. Lol
So I just hodl.

Thats too complex for normies.
They needed to deliver it: Easy cheesy chicken burger style.

Uhhh? 
IT IS A BUBBLE already.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:04:08
Yes, yes it will.
It will be the biggest bubble ever.
Told that people already. But they still think it is a scam (scam! =bubble)

Why would exchanges do that?
They don't want you to move btc. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:45:17
They want to you to keep your BTC on the exchange. 
Moving makes them lose business.
Or why do you think bittrex, bitfenix etc etc charge you like 20 or 30 dollar to move coins off the exchange?

You are all wrong. It is up because this happened :
Texas judge interrupts jury, says God told him defendant is not guilty

I don't know. But did you hear about our lord savior raiblocks? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:16:34
Actually, that's a great idea, send it with 1 Satoshi. Tell them it is on the way. 
Wait till they leave.
Do another transaction with $50 fee. Just to be sure :) 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:55:46
You lucky suckers :)
Happy new year though :) 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:55:51
Five dollars is super cheap.
Don't know why people are complaining. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:42:03
Yup. Exactly the same problem as raiblocks.
They think 7000 tps is possible. For the node.
I have no idea how many IOPS that are.
But I don't think that desktop grade hds are going to cut it.
Or even network bandwidth.
And let's not speak about telephones.
Those ssds wearing out quicker than you can say : I need a new ssd!

Not in germany. As long as you keep in crypto. No tax. As long as you don't cash out. No tax. If you cash out before one year : individual taxes. After a year : no taxes. 
We are dozens! I tell you! Dozens in crypto!

But but but Bitcoin will save us here!

Use metals from Asteroid to create box, create box, put gold in it, drop box on Earth into Ocean, which is deep, but not impossible deep. The metal ist just thick enough to survive and melting away on its way down.

Oh Boy. Here we go
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:19:10
I hope this future is true!
Amazing time to be alive :)

Create two fud videos! 
@_date: 2018-03-17 08:48:51
The delusion is strong in some people.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:48:55
I don't believe in time travel.
I know :) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:59:13
Btc could go down to 5k.
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:48:53
I will create a fud video for just 10k!
