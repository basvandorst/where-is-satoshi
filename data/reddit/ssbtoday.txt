Google Wallet is Mastercard actually.

It's because they suspect him as a money transmitter, and since Coinbase is a US company, they have to agree to follow all of FinCen's policies.

It actually doesn't say that there will be a new currency, but rather one that will be adopted into it. Perhaps it might actually be Bitcoin? Who knows.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:44:46
Almost Human has common occurrences of bitcoin, but did you catch the reference on The Blacklist? I lost my shit when I heard it haha.

I think they're going to go out of business if they keep offering me such insane deals... [I mean, who wouldn't honor this deal?](
@_date: 2014-07-10 09:51:22
Well they're hiring for a significant amount of financial departments, so I suggest someone to go apply.
@_date: 2014-03-25 08:31:08
I believe they were going to use Coinbase?
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:09:31
Thank you very much. :)

There's also the problem when you hover over the Excellent/Good/Broken, it doesn't return to what is active.
You might also want to change your robots.txt to allow a [meta description on google](

When you send bitcoins it generates a new one.

If it misses the transaction, it will have to somehow query for a transaction. SMS or Internet is required then.

You actually can sign with Coinbase...

It's a threat of terrorism, report it to the FBI. Seal the letter in a plastic bag only handling it by gloves and the corners.

I'll comment my address later with an edit to this comment. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:53:27
Not a money transmitter therefore illegal.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:25:24
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:53:03
Yep definitely a sold account. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:32:26
Someone who is experienced in wiki editing should probably add BitVegas to here: 
@_date: 2013-03-10 01:39:16
Then I had hoped that you would run a full node someplace then and use the bitcoin api to connect it then.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:15:23
You must be checking out some *really small* bit faucets.
If you have a minecraft account, BitVegas gives out 0.001 BTC every 15 minutes. So you could make some money that way. Also CoinAd gives out money randomly if you chat... So technically you could learn python and take back break every 15 minutes to collect some money.
Also, the Bitcoin tips here are nice. :3
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:34:29
And there's usually an admin/mod on at all times, can't say the same thing about thebitmines. Also MinecraftCC pays a lot more now that they removed MCMMO.

How many bytes does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie-Roll Pop? FTFY
@_date: 2013-04-21 08:24:09
Was it located anywhere near the flooding? Is there water damage of any sort?
@_date: 2013-05-06 02:53:05
[I'll assume you haven't read the documentation available on their site.](
Check out the folder %appdata%\MultiBit and snatch your wallet file out. Then in MultiBit attempt to reset transactions back to a certain date.
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:04:21
You guys realize you iron it to melt it together right?
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:23:04
It's run using Coinbase as far as the developer said, so minimal fees are probably going to be expected.
@_date: 2013-04-22 00:41:15
XAMPP is really easy to setup, I suggest that.
@_date: 2013-02-17 13:03:14
Honestly, the best one you could really use to get real users is actually... **Reddit** itself...
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:59:44
They probably do but prefer not to.
@_date: 2013-08-14 07:22:12
Guys I would like to point this out, but this has been up for suggestion for a LONG time now.
@_date: 2013-08-03 16:20:07
Is it possible that there can be an embedded player? (And make a link that's locked to an IP Address with a key to watch it later?)
Also is BTCFile a mirror or is it run from there?
@_date: 2013-04-22 00:43:35
All live tickers use the MtGox API either way, so effectively it wouldn't relieve the load anyways.
Notice how on  it says "Subscribed to MtGox Live Ticker"? Yeah same thing as us all making one for ourselves.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:22:16
Alright, so BitVegas is a Bitcoin casino that takes place in the realm of Minecraft. As a starting promotion they are giving out Millibits to everyone. It's up to you whether you test your luck or not.
Edit: Apparently they've started a referral program aswell... So if you have friends that play minecraft and you tell them to go to your link before they log in, you get 5 mBTC.
@_date: 2013-01-22 07:00:02
Still going? :)
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:48:56
I'd have to disagree with you, the numerous times I've logged in, there hasn't been a single mod/admin on at all.
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:07:50
I'll hope this works, but try this:  (For ClarkMoody's Bitcoin Ticker)
(It's copy of the html/js files, if you prefer, I'd suggest you right click-&gt; Save As... in chrome and save it yourself)
@_date: 2013-05-06 03:51:19
Well if you have the private key, you should probably check the public address for the transaction. If it's not there, then it's in the Bitcoin Void somewhere.
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:39:57
Anyone have any idea why Bitcoin is at such a high number lately?
@_date: 2013-04-21 11:07:51
I for one only see Iron and Gold Blocks there sire... You seem to be mistaken?

@_date: 2013-04-08 09:44:29
@_date: 2013-04-21 08:32:33
My assumption on why the last 20% is irrelevant is due to the fact that there are addresses contained within are simply generated ahead of time for clients that are offline to have private keys for those keys ahead of time.
Wallet.dat has pregenerated private keys for sending transactions.

Please don't spam the price as it updates... We don't need a live ticker of posts. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:44:32
I actually would like this, as it would show that your product is effective and well worth the effort to integrate this magnificent product. If you can withstand a ddos, we can all move forward in this cyberville universe.
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:42:04
Wrong post haha: 
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:04:18
Well most of those tickers are just javascript based, so from what I can tell, just right click-&gt; Save As (chrome saves all scripts with it) and you'll have an offline ticker I suppose. Worked for  for me.
@_date: 2013-02-25 17:17:45
Awesome, I'll try it when I get home!
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:43:03
If what you are simply saying is that you cannot perform json api requests when this is SPECIFICALLY for a webserver, then my friend... I see no reason as to why waste the resources of a perfectly good server.
@_date: 2013-05-18 18:07:28
I just bought $55 worth. Thank you for your wonderful service :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:00:28
Please create a directory of these sites on either the bitcoin wiki or on your site so they can get some exposure or tell them to do so. :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:53:46
Wait... Was there any verification behind this? If there wasn't I'd like to state I'm Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:56:23
And thus we hit $51...
I fear *OP is right*.
