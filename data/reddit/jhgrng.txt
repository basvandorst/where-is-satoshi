Not really no :P I don't really like gambling at casinos. I only bet a bit and occasionally play poker with friends.

Account created 3 hours ago? This explains everything. :)

Not really, no. Due to Bitcoin being unregulated and also the ability to remain anonymous you're basically safe.

I know right? Bitcoin is the future of sports betting!
@_date: 2015-12-11 14:09:45
Yup, exactly my thoughts. OneHash has some pretty great odds, especially when there's a clear favourite.

I played on bet365 too but once I tried Bitcoin sports betting I switched immediately and never looked back. 100% recommend.

It seems it doesn't really matter, but somehow people are REALLY interested to know.
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:20:25
Bitcoin isn't regulated in most places.

Dude, are you serious? It's like a sequel of the biggest saga in the history of cinema, every theatre is booked for the premiere, Star Wars is everywhere, literally. On YouTube, on Facebook and Twitter, you can even get Star Wars battle ships instead of a car on Google Maps... Of course it's going to break this record. Easy money I'd say.

Cloudbet requires a classical deposit of fund before you can start betting, OneHash on the other hand works a bit differently. You deposit money per bet, there's no registration required and it's pretty straight forward. You only deposit money per single bet so OneHash doesn't hold your money for too long. Makes it more trustable IMO.

Funny thing, you could actually meet the guys behind OneHash at the Web Summit in Dublin, Ireland at one of the stands, I actually even posted a picture of it on I quickly skimmed the Terms and Conditions of those sites and they don't really say where they're from or if they're a real company. At Web Summit OneHash had a sign that they're a real company incorporated in Costa Rica. I guess one of the concerns for the users when it comes to using a bitcoin service is that there's this dilemma, you know, "are you going to run away with my money?" kind of thing. Nobody wants to get goxxed and users are always sceptical.
In my opinion you should never store your funds at some other place than your own wallet for an extended period of time. That's why I like OneHash so much because you only deposit money per single bet. So you don't have to create an account and deposit god knows how much in order to start playing. You want to bet on an event, you send them your money, event is over and they send you back your winnings, simple as that. You might want to try it out as it's not that big of a deal, they have a policy that the minimum bet can be 0.001 BTC and that's it. One of the things that generally repels me is that you have to create an account in order to try a service out. Or for example if you want to buy bitcoins at coinbase you need to supply them with your id and stuff. I don't like that, so OneHash is nice to be a bit different and allows people to just pop in without the need to create an account, deposit a lot of money etc.
I think we're still in the "early adopters" stage and we probably still will be in that stage for 2-3 more years, but with time the companies behind those services will become more reliable and stuff. Anyway, I've been playing at those sportsbooks for a while now and so far nobody stole my money.

Thanks, just signed up!

I'm flattered, you're so kind! I guess that would be ok? Please bare in mind that I'm just a simple web developer throwing in my 2 cents. There are far more knowledgable people out there, there's even a [subreddit for design critiques](
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:27:44
I absolutely agree and I was really confused when I saw the new "design".
@_date: 2015-08-27 11:06:45
I know right? It looks like one of those generic sites that you just know is going to scam you.
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:06:29
It just looks cluttered, messy and out of order. Phrase "buy bitcoins" appears on the landing page 4 times, "The most important invention in the history of the world since the internet itself. Shut up and give me your money!"...
Besides the things you mentioned(fonts, scaling, colours... they probably haven't heard of responsive, flat design?), it just feels like it's badly designed on the UX/UI side. It feels like you're bombarded with a million information and I'm like "wow what's going on" - it happens all the time on a variety of sites, take [bestbtcfaucet.com]( or [nitrogensports.eu]( for example. Do this. Do that. Too much.
There are some well crafted sites out there though, I love the simplistic design of [onehash.com]( or even more minimalistic [bitter.io]( Simple, beautiful, easy to use. You can tell somebody has put some thought into designing those websites.
The overall impression of the site is the deciding factor to whether I'm going to try it out or not and since it looks like somebody hasn't really thought it through, it simply rejects me.

A while ago I wrote about [Why I switched from traditional to Bitcoin betting and why you should too]( There are a couple good ones like [cloudbet.com]( [onehash.com]( and [anonibet.com]( - I especially like onehash which doesn't require registration and is different from other sportsbooks(it's mutual betting) which sometimes leads to great rates. Overall there are a couple of good ones and I think it would be best if you try some and see for yourself what works best for you.
