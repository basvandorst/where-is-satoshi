this is a farce. Everyone is running around talking about BTC VS BCH. It's so childish.
In one fell swoop - with lightning network activated - atomic swaps allow bitcoin to process 1 billion transactions a day for pennies due to litecoin being a payment layer in the atomic swap process.
Yet you all narrowmindedly take sides and don't look at the bigger picture.
If lightning and atomic swaps activate this year - bitcoin cash will be nothing more than an altcoin dividend of bitcoin. 
Even if it happens next year - the coin and setup with the lowest transaction fees and txn speed will win. And bitcoin cash is not going to be that coin.
