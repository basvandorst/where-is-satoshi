I wish i was not limited by coinbase at the moment as well. I have been trying to buy coins for hours yet have had no success. I was able to buy a few yesterday morning but not many...
And the instant ways are tough to do working a day job, as well as the fee's. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:35:17
I have seen similar transactions. I was hoping it would hold around $40.
I have been on the edge of my seat these past few nights!!
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:57:06
Lucky duck! I have been trying constantly yet have not had one go through at all today. Got lucky yesertday morning EST.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:58:35
I think the buyers will remain, just a huge jump in volatility for a few days to a week or so. Its gonna equalize after this(for who knows how long days weeks or years)
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:24:30
That was awesome to see! Great job shakethatbass
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:37:46
This has been the a great day to watch this market! intense. Bitcoin UP UP UP.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:16:35
Yeah, hope this will settle alot of the recent volatility. And allow some of the new BUYERS to come in and grow bitcoins userbase (as in actually using and spending coins) rather than its basement investors and speculators. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:00:54
Seems like they should have some coins form all these sells! But yeah ill keep click DDOSing the site :-)
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:52:13
downvote. and hope for mods or automated bans.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:42:54
I know, it pisses me off a bit. I also wish my coins from earlier in the week where already in play rather than in non hedged limbo :-(
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:15:16
Also i know this could be highly presumptuous! and very likely a wrong statement.
But i hope they equalize around 40$
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:35:45
I am holding for sure, i believe in the bit coin. I am honestly just looking for them to dump so i can get more coins for my self!
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:36:59
I was predicting it would hold around $40, that's where i am hoping it will hold.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:40:32
I really wish my coins had already arrived from coinbase from my other purchase this week. Would have liked to be able to have a few more in the action here....
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:36:59
congratulations on that!
I am ready to get more involved!
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:54:29
I want to step in, but money transfers are too slow! And all the instant methods have been so unreliable!
Coinbase increase your quota!
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:53:17
This has been quite a ride so far, I am half hoping it falls to around 40.00$ and holds. This rapid volatility has been such a rush, but god its really so hard to determine which variables are playing into the rise at any given point. But i think the speculators will bullpen soon (in the next 2-3 days?) and then we will see a collapse back down to around 40$
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:59:01
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:19:19
I would rather it hold around 30 - 40 a drop of that magnitude would be too detrimental to the actual growth of the bitcoin userbase. Super volatility would not be good, after all the recent 'good' press.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:52:49
Bit it actually just went down.... (first time since ive used it)
Edit: back up
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:43:50
Yeah, will shoot them over today. got a address you want em sent to? or just want me to use tip bot?
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:40:13
I am so tempted to buy in now, but I am trying to resist I was half expecting a few days around 40$.
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:51:23
Had similar sucess just now as well. Haven't been able to get a transaction through with them in ages.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:49:18
I cant wait to see, either way. up or down in for the ride.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:36:03
Love it! 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:04:12
Very very very very nice man! Congratulations what price did you lock on them? Before it broke 40$ or at the peak?
That a bundle of coins, very happy for your win! 
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:36:28
I saw a 25 thousand sell a few seconds ago. over 600 coins.
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:30:23
Much appreciated! Coins incoming Thursday. Repayment + reddit gold coming your way. 
Thanks so much, I am very grateful.  
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:01:20
Congrats! I hope you made a bundle! How many coins?
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:44:16
Very interesting. I wonder how long this will sustain? 
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:36:59
Both services have there place in the bitcoin world. They serve different markets. Coinbase has not been able to compete at anywhere near the volume of MTgox yet, so its a hard comparison to even draw at this point. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:39:52
it certainly wont kill the btc, this is just part of the fun.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:49:19
Got me on the edge of my seat.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:44:37
You think this was a single person (or cooperation) A deliberate cornering of the market?
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:21:09
Well congratulations on a smart move. hopefully both your bank roll and mind benefited immensely from your efforts.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:43:20
They are strong, This is just a pump and dump the bitcoin will prevail.
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:45:20
I am in a similar situation. But i am just looking to buy, spend, and hold a few coins at this point. I want to start having a larger reserve at my disposal, simply because I think in the long term it will be great. And hope i could get out before it hit total shit, if i get in now. (now being early, as opposed to the 'final' peak)
But i am just a idiot, possibly driven mad by to many years in a cube, and too many peoples computer problems. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:06:13
Yeah, hopefully the speculators will dump here and give a lot of the actual new buyers come in with substantially less volatility. A lot of good press for bitcoin in the past few days. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:52:06
also money.
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:46:38
Most people would tell you to just actually research this. But ill try and break it down simply.
There are a variety of different types of "wallets" we use these. Some may exist on our computer (just a file) some in online services. Or even paper wallets. There are a lot of possibilities, and i really think it would be better for you to take some time and really learn about bit coin and how it works, as your really trying to go in blind if you don't already know how the wallet works.
[We Use Coins](
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:38:22
Only coins i was able to grab this week where at $40 and those where to spend not hold. But i am going to buy in big once some dust settles.
Also coinbase is so hard to get coins, I need to get verified on Mt Gox coinbase just cant keep up with demand anymore. And the instant funding options are so fee heavy and have been unreliable as of late. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:32:43
Yeah looks like it could bullpen and drop sharply like the last big crash.
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:13:17
Connection lag is gonna be pretty slow everywhere at the moment.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:11:54
Congratulations on your win! I am just enjoying the show. the bitcoin is truly a beautiful thing to witness(in every way!). 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:32:08
Anyone else wonder how detrimental it is for new users to come to and see the top post be 'Pop!', goodbye buyers :-( 
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:39:03
I have heard good things about them, I am going to use them for my next instant purchase. Bitinstant has been down to much (even though they are recovering pretty gracefullish from the hack)
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:42:10
Holy shit!
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:37:08
I was more referring to actual buyers and not speculators. People looking to buy, spend, and hold coins. Not just buy and sell.
@_date: 2013-02-14 14:31:02
contact their support bitinstant is good at fixing their mistakes. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:31:02
Yeah i think it might bullpen, happened before could happen again. But i don't think it will go much below 30ish.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:39:27
Valid call. I am hoping it holds around $40
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:27:30
Lose your head, keep your coins. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:29:32
I am guessing it will hold around the $35 range. I don't think we will see $27
EDIT: ( i guess it could bullpen then drop sharply, thought of this after i submitted. )
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:28:40
They wont see it that way from the outside, if they are buyers huge volatility like this will probably scare them off. The BTC charts are pretty intimidating to people who are not interested in trading.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:36:53
Insanity has ensued! It is amazing to observe! Wish i had more in the pot to gamble but, at least I'm in the game! 
The price has been worth the adrenaline thus far! Don't play with what you cant stand to do with out.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:13:53
I think this is what will really be the constant motivator behind bitcoin! Speculators will always come in, and this certainly wont be the last time we see movement like this in bitcoins future. 
It is a beautiful, unregulated beast that is stunning to observe and be a part of.
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:41:45
Did you only introduce him during this rush? because the price was pretty stable as of late, with exception of the past few days.
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:43:45
You should assume they will, as coinbase has a rolling system. They can be out of coins one second and have some the next. You just got very lucky. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:07:23
Wow, this should be fun
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:50:22
I am in the same boat with you! Same sad lonely ship with treasure chest yet no BTC booty to fill them with! I wanna buy and hold em in my grubby hands.
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:27:06
Oh no kidding, I had the funds but not the balls to really invest. I just usually get bitcoins to make purchases and support the network. (also play on some sites with the change)
But i have been really learning how the network works and the markets during this time, and i feel like I am really ready to invest once some dust settles. But who knows its back up to 43.84 now.... I am sure some people just made big bucks playing that swing. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:46:58
What an adrenaline rush this whole experience can be. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:39:21
I have also had some good experiences with coinbase. I have typically used Bitinsant and other funding more instant funding sources, but have used coinbase a few times now! Love it, and luckily came out better when the coins arrived than when i locked in the price.
