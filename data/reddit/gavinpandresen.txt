Hand over your driver's licence to a Bitcoin 'ATM' and then let it do a biometric scan of one of your body parts. Once that's complete, feed it your real money (i.e. what they want to get from you), and it'll give you Bitcoins after a couple of hours - minus the 10% fee.

But don't you see? If Bitcoin continues to grow and does actually become as big as Visa (as many of the people here hope and believe), then it will cause the Bitcoin network to cease working.
As Gavin has said, and as I quote him in the image, there are only two options. Either:
1) An artifical size limit is imposed, as there is now but hasn't yet been reached (1MB). This would limit the number of transactions to a small number, and only those willing to pay the highest fees would get put in the block. In other words, most people will be unable to use Bitcoin and effectively the network ceases to work for most people.
2) There is no artifical size limit, and blockchain bloat continues. The number of nodes will decrease to the point where there are none left, and the network literally ceases to function.


And what do you have left? A tiny number of centralized entities upon which the entire network depends. And what big business would want to run it for free, when it would cost so much money?


That may be the case, but how much data do you get? I would bet that you don't get more than a terabyte a month, and that would probably cost quite a lot of money. This also doesn't respond to the matter of international sea links which have limited capacity.


Blockchain bloat is actually a major concern for the developers. They may not consider it an existential threat (at least, not yet), but they are talking about it and referring to it as an urgent matter - primarily because of the high transaction fees problem is they retain the 1MB block size limit.

If you've got a solution proposal, go ahead and make it. The developers don't have any - they haven't thought up of one over the past few years - I'm sure they'd appreciate your help in the matter.
Don't rely on wishful thinking though.


Who would do it for free? Nodes generate no revenue
Plus, internet bandwidth - not just speed, but data - is a big problem. Even if you throw fucktons of money at it, it would take decades to build the required infrastructure within a nation, and worse still, you have the problem of international sea links which are limited in data capacity and would require huge concerted efforts to build, lay and maintain.


This is what is already the case. Nodes each store a copy of the blockchain. You can't just break up the blockchain into pieces and say one node has a piece, and another node a different piece - that would be ridiculous because that would actually result in centralization where one node might be the only source of a section of the blockchain. And who would broadcast the latest blocks? Only a handful of nodes?

You seem to live in Germany.
Quoted from Wikipedia:
"As of January 2014, a typical monthly cost for "dual flatrate" internet and telephone service is €25 for ADSL2+ (16 Mbit/s downlink, 1 Mbit/s uplink) and €30 for VDSL2 (50 Mbit/s downlink, 10 Mbit/s uplink)."
"With over 12 million customers the incumbent Deutsche Telekom is the market leader"
1.4% of German households can connect via FTTH which offers a speed of 200/100 mbit/s.
According to the Deutsche Telekom online store, such a connection costs 54.95€/month.
Interestingly there is indeed no data limit, but I did a search on Google and this article came up:
Basically it says they are intending on throttling data to 2 mbit/s once a user reaches 75GB (that's 0.075TB!) of data usage, because to quote the representative:
"Continually higher bandwidth can't be financed with ever-lower prices"
So much for your infinite data claim.
They probably already have a fair-use policy in place btw, which would state that they can decide to disconnect you if they feel you are using too much data.
Again, please read up on the limitations of international sea links.


Almost anyone can run a node now with their home computer, yet the number is already down to less than 8000.


Again, why is it valuable data? Being a node is not the only way of getting such data - not even when it comes to real-time data

Strong counterargument/10
It's funny, because you're doing my speech for me. You're reinforcing the fact that there is no solution to the problem, and don't want others to know about it.
Perhaps I should have just put in the title 'BUY BUY BUY!' instead and get upvoted to the front page.

If Bitcoin matched Visa today, you would need a capacity of at least 23TB per year. A 4TB drive on Amazon costs 100€. That means you'd need to spend 600€ for a year's worth of storage for just one node.
Seagate say they won't be making 20TB drives until 2020.
Again, who's going to do that for free out of the goodness of their heart?


How would it be valuable to run a node? Even if a copy of the blockchain is valuable, why not just download a snapshot?


"Having a dozen or so nodes running the entire network is decentralization"
The more you know..


How can you make it smaller? The average transaction size today the Bitcoin wiki says is just ~500 bytes. I think you'd be hard pressed to make improvements on this.

They have to verify your identity in order to comply with government regulations, or they risk getting shut down.
Bitcoin as an idea died a long time ago when it first started being valued in terms of fiat - therefore leading to the creation of corrupt and/or vulnerable centralized entities (i.e. exchanges), which act as the bottleneck  when getting into the system.
It's only going to get worse as governments look to further regulate and tax Bitcoin.
Personally I feel like Bitcoin is just being made into a replica of fiat, except its starting from scratch. All the supposed benefits, such as pseudonymity, *impossibility* to regulate, very low or nil fees, etc. have all been trashed.

This is just one of Bitcoin's irreparable flaws. I just thought this particular one hasn't been receiving the attention it deserves.
You grossly underestimate the problem. Anyone who reads through the image I posted, all supported with calculations, can clearly see that the Bitcoin network cannot get anywhere near as big as Visa.
If you think the ordinary consumer will have the space and internet bandwidth for over a thousand terabytes each year (and to do it for free!), then good luck to you - I can't say many people will believe you.
In the image I show that Seagate will not be producing 20TB drives until at least 2020 [(here's a direct source for you)]( and also mention the fact that international sea links are insufficient for that amount of bandwidth.
If you seriously think ordinary consumers will have access to such large amounts of internet data in the future - and at such fast speeds, then I suggest you lookup the CVC costs of the National Broadband Network in Australia currently underway, which plans to  supply up to 100 mbit/s nationwide by 2021-2025 (at earliest). The cost of data is, and will continue to be, expensive - because international sea link capacity is limited. The more data people use, the more expensive data will become.
