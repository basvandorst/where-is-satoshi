Illusion of freedom? No... it's freedom.  Institutions like banks are afforded the same individual freedoms granted to people (usually, see cake store being forced to serve gay couple).

The point is that the consumer has the freedom to borrow from the bank that they like. If they don't like a bank, they are free to take their business elsewhere.
