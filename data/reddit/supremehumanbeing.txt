I have the address that contains my coins, its locked to CHANGE. I can't change the address, but I want to SEND my coins somewhere so I can sell them
How do I go about doing that?

No, I only had a miner run for a few days, 2 years ago. 
Then I got periodic emails that said I received a payout. I could never figure out what to do with it, so I left it.
Then, one day, my PC crashed. Wouldnt start up. I donated the PC, after removing the HDDs (which are in my drawer still).
7 months ago, I installed GUIminer and the little buggers started mining again. I closed the program and deleted it, because they interfered with my gaming too often.
Today, I read the frontpage and thought I'd cash out. 
Still can't figure out how to get my coins from mining.bitcoin.cz's address to a wallet to sell them or buy something nice for the wife with or whatever.

Oh wait. So all addresses are "Wallet Addresses"? Yeah, then in that case, I have the wallet locked and I can't change my wallet.
But, does that mean I can't send coins from the wallet?
I can't find ANY mention of a wallet on the control panel of the website.

Your payout address XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is locked.
This is just so my payouts wont go to another address.
From what I have read, I need a private key to add the address to a wallet. But I can't find a private key in there anywhere. (under account settings etc)
The PC that did the mining, doesn't exist anymore. I upgraded a long time ago, so the mining app and whatever was in those folders, are gone.

Ok, I have 4.03 bitcoins from mining 2 years ago. How do I sell it?

I used bitcoin.cz, if that matters?
