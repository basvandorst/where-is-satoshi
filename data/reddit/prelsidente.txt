In that case, Bitcoin should be worth much more.
It's decentralized, so no central point of failure, control or censor.
It's limited, only 21M
It's unique, no other non crypto asset with all these properties combined.
It's unfakeable. You can't double spend or fake it.
It's global. You can access it from any part of the world.

That's not how logic works. When will people understand it's not all or nothing.
You don't need to sell all your bitcoin when it goes up and makes you a millionaire. You should only sell a part so that if it goes even higher, you're still getting profit.
You don't need to love someone just because they hate the same person as you. That person can still be an asshole on all other points of view.

This is very true.
Bubblers will never understand it though.
Because they don't understand the inner workings and full advantages of the asset, they can't understand its potential. 
So they will always view it as an internet token that nerds use, without properly analyzing the decentralized, unique, limited, upgradeable and unfakable properties of Bitcoin that make up its value.
If Gold market is not a bubble, then Bitcoin won't be a bubble until it surpasses its market cap.
Oh sure, it can have its incovenients now and then, but guess what? Gold is not divisable and you can't upgrade it. You can and will upgrade Bitcoin to surpass its inconveniences.

The reason why you see the price rise and fall is because there are active players (individuals and companies) with a lot of money trading Bitcoin.
These movements are not created by hodlers or weak hands. They are created by people with hundreds and thousands of Bitcoins, gambling and arbitraging.
Those are the bears you are talking about.
Those are the bears that come in here yelling "Bubble" when they want to short Bitcoin to buy in lower. The ones that say Bitcoin has no value because of fees, yet you have no other financial asset with Bitcoin flexibility and properties.

I don't think it is. I think it's way undervalued.
I think a lot of people have realized the value of a globally connected, decentralized, secure, unforgeable, fast, easy and cheap to move asset (compared with other traditional finance assets). Of course everyone will want their hands on them.
Can it be better? Of course, there's so much where it can improve. But comparing it with stocks, funds, securities, Gold, etc. etc. Bitcoin just blows them out of the water. No comparison. It still has a way to go to beat some other assets regarding transaction count and fees, but it will get there.

Running from 2011 to 2013.
In 2011 Bitcoins were very cheap. So transactions with 1000+ bitcoin were very common and why Silk Road accumulated so much Bitcoin in early days. It was more of an early adopter result than actually market share.
However, there were a lot of ways to use Bitcoin, even in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Just mining equipment and Bitcoin related products were traded with Bitcoin. 
The truth is that we don't know, there's no study, nor it could be accurate. It's just speculation from "news" blogs to create an impact "used by terrorists".

@_date: 2017-12-10 14:36:25


Yes you can. You can prove you own it because you have a private key that allows you to sign messages from that address and it can be confirmed in any part of the world. This hash power makes it impossible for someone to break that system. This hash power is what secures the Bitcoin you own.
Bitcoin value is not abstract because of its utility as the most secure global network of proof of ownership. So secure that no one can tamper with. Even the most powerful banks don't have such a secure network. Not even nations.
You can transfer your Bitcoin safely across the world in under an hour thanks to this hash power. No bank can do that today as safe and fast as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:02:15

@_date: 2017-12-04 21:01:50
People who say Bitcoin is a bubble have no idea what a bubble is.
Bubble is when an asset is overpriced.
Bitcoin is growing because people only now are becoming aware of what it is and realizing it's an underpriced asset. That's why there's a rally in price.
If Bitcoin is a bubble, then what about Gold? That you can't divide it easily, send it through the internet or easily store it and transport it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:57:39
They are hoping that if they scream bubble long enough that People will stop buying it. Except, people in Korea, Venezuela, Japan and other countries don't really watch US news.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:33:55
Except Bitcoin has utility. It allows for cryptographic proof of ownership and transfer of that same ownership across the globe without intermediaries, something you can't do with gold.
Of course Jim Cramer knows nothing about this, so that's why he says it's Monopoly Money.

First of all, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Having said that, Exchanges are overwhelmed with new users every day. People have been waiting weeks to be verified.
That on top of wealthy people who are now getting at least 10% of their wealth in Bitcoin as a safeguard means that this Bitcoin run is not going to stop anytime soon.

Ok, so it's not a bubble, now it's a correction.
You only see a correction when there is one. When Bitcoin went from $3k to $11k there was no correction, yet everyone was saying it was a bubble.
If you scream correction all the time, eventually you will be right because there will be one. It also means you are wrong 90% of the time.
Bubble is when an asset is overpriced.
Bitcoin as the unique asset with never seen properties is very underpriced because it's very limited for the amount of access it provides. So, no, we're not in a bubble.
At current prices, Gold is more in a bubble than Bitcoin.

I understand the bubble argument even though it doesn't resonate with me. Tulips don't have any value besides looking pretty. Bitcoin solves a huge financial problem of double spending. Not to mention the ability to store or transfer any amount of value without extra security across the globe, so the comparison with tulips is ridiculous.

What people should really want is uncorrupted regulations. Regulations that favor inovation but stop this kind of insider trading. Of course that type of regulation doesn't exist in traditional markets and probably will not exist in crypto either.

Why the fuck are you making a transaction from all those addresses? Of course you are going to pay a high fee, your transaction occupies half the blockchain. Try moving from more addresses, I bet you will pay more as you should.
Also, start using segwit.
Also, that's moving 340k for a 0.3% fee
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:08:35

Exactly, Bitcoin is a new kind of asset and finance people used to traditional markets are having a hard time trying to fit it and comparing it to traditional markets.
Only people who can understand the huge difference between traditional assets and Bitcoin can really understand its price behavior.

There's plenty of Bitcoin to be sold, for the right price. Everyone has their price. Have I mentioned price? Do you get it now?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:05:53
I don't undertand these guys. They don't know how to evaluate Bitcoin because they haven't spent the time understanding how it works and its utility.
However, they have no problem in evaluating Gold, which has no financial utility besides people agreeing on the value of it.
To me it just seems that this is a new financial asset with particular properties (like 24/7 trading and transfer) and they are trying to adapt it to a traditional asset behavior. Trying to understand Bitcoin from a traditional finance point of view will never work. It's like fitting an elephant in a mini.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:41:28
Bitcoin cash propaganda.

The amount of people trying to day trade Bitcoin is ridiculous and the reason why Bitcoin is so volatile.
Panic buying and panic selling. You're giving money to professionals who do this for a living, manipulate markets with typical psychological tactics and have tons of funds to do such.

You sound like someone who has bought gold and is trying to justify that decision. Good for you, but it's not for me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:49:07
Who is going to impose regulation on exchanges then?
What's to stop exchanges from doing what Coinbase just did?
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:34:19
Nope, because it's taxed.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:07:52
But but... He's trying to give a negative feeling so he can buy lower and you are ruining it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:14:35
Because people are calling Bitcoin a bubble with a market cap of $300b when Gold is worth $7 trillion and you can't personally do shit with it.
Also, people from Traditional markets get pissed off when you call Gold a bubble, so why not? It's clearly overpriced.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:18:11
Here we go with the now annoying opposite meaning titles again
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:44:27
Next time, I would be more patient as exchanges are currently overwhelmed with new users.
Also, 1.8M needs a very accurate background verification to know if money is legit. They don't want to be responsible for the exchange who cashed out some hacked Bitcoin or similar.
I don't blame Bitstamp one bit for such delay.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:58:59


Stopped reading there. Even if hypothetical, that would be extremely dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:48:10
Yes, but Bubble means that an asset is overpriced, which is not the case.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:56:02
At this point, most counties are monitoring entry and exit points for Bitcoin, so you can be sure you will be caught if you try to evade taxes.

Bitcoin is going major adoption in countries like Korea, Japan, India and even US, yet some users here screaming "Bubble" hoping they can dip it and buy lower.
These bubblers fail to understand that currently the adoption bottleneck is in the ability for exchanges to accept more new users. They are all overwhelmed, or we would see even a bigger rally in price.
Too late boys, but nice try.

@_date: 2017-12-08 10:48:08
Yes, this is what crypto is about.
A decentralized financial asset, globally available to everyone, easily transmittable. Especially the unbanked or in hyper inflationary countries. Bitcoin's main target is accessability.
Everyone knew the price was going to rise except those who want the traditional finance system to work to have their profits or those who haven't gone through the time to understand Bitcoin.
Every person in the globe has the right to have Bitcoin, so stop acting like they shouldn't because they don't fully agree with your views, how the price should go up or how Bitcoin should be used. This is not a club, this is an open source utility that should be available to each and every person on earth.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:54:27


A lot of people made way more than that just hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:44

@_date: 2017-12-12 18:21:01
I can't hold or transport more than $1k gold without being worried it will be stolen.

So we have to agree with the two parts? We can't agree with just one part of it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:43:12
Yes, really. Mainstream adoption means parabolic charts where price rises like crazy.
Also, look at it with percentages now, not values.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:31:57
You're the best and so smart
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:10:52
The utility gold provides as a store of value is nothing compared with Bitcoin.
Especially in the age of the internet.
Bitcoin was made for it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:53:50
You know, in 1992 everyone said e-mail would never work, it was too complicated to write from the command line. That sounds familiar doesn't it
The thing is, Bitcoin surpasses gold in every way possible, but you don't see anyone calling Gold a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:36:57
For someone who doesn't understand Bitcoin's value, you sure hang around here a lot.
You don't need to hang in a Bitcoin sub if you don't believe in it's value.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:04:53
Have you been here since $500? This doesn't seem different at all from $1200 to $1300 or from $120 to $130
The problem is that some people here still see this as units instead of percentages.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:13:07
I didn't know people adopted children to use them as currency and using them to buy and sell stuff.
Of course adoption is about hodling.

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:08:07


Yeah, for another few months and then goes back above ATH.
I think people already learned the lesson with previous dips.
Plus, percentages instead of units. This is the same thing as Bitcoin going from $14 to $15, it's less than 10%.
Plus institutional money.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:43:49

A bubble is only a bubble when asset is overpriced.
If Bitcoin is overpriced, than Gold is ridiculously overpriced and in a even bigger bubble.

Any media site from the UK has been charging against Bitcoin for a few weeks now.
There are numerous reports that South Korea is just regulating exchanges, which is a good thing for them to be audited so we can make sure they have the Bitcoins they claim and don't fake volume.

Beware of "Bubble" posts. There are people butthurt they didn't get in sooner and are hoping for a Bubble to either get in or to prove them right for not getting in.
The reason for this price rally is that finally Bitcoin is going mainstream. It's appearing in every major publication and TV channel. Everyone is saying how amazing technology and how it will revolutionize finance as well as its price is skyrocketing.
Of course most people hearing this want to get in on the action and be a part of it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:55:38

So now you are hoping it won't go further so you don't lose out.
What a loser.
At least get out with honor.

Exchange it for Bitcoin at Bitstamp.
There are a few other exchanges that let you do that.

@_date: 2017-12-04 11:54:26
They will explode in value.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:40:32
Ah ok, so let's speculate on possible exchange insolvencies...
Sigh, the shit you guys come up with to draw a storm around Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:14:24
Nope, gotta keep ignoring the signs that people want Bitcoin. If they scream bubble 100% maybe it will become true eventually.
Also, Gold must be a crazy bubble then being that asset is clearly overpriced for its non existing utility.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:36:22
A few months ago everyone on this sub was saying Bitcoin is digital gold, doesn't need bigger blocks or more transactions. Now that everyone is using it as digital gold those same people are screaming bubbles
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:36:12
Bubble prophets = assholes who say anything to buy cheaper. They would probably sell their mother to get in cheaper.
Greed is a very ugly thing and you can see truckloads of it in this sub screaming bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:29:14
Yeah, but he probably sold some so he's saying that so people get shaky hands and start a sell frenzy. Except there will be no dip for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:08:16


No because it doesn't have the hashpower that Bitcoin has and could be disrputed.
That's why bitcoin has the value that it has. It's the oldest, the original and with such an immense amount of hash power that it can't be taken over or stopped by any entity.


Not to me it doesn't. In fact, the minute you give me gold, I'll sell it. Not even useful as paperweight because someone will steal it. The use in electronics doesn't justify its insane value alone.


But no one will mine it, so there's no point and there's no value.
Seems like you don't have all the knowledge required to make the assumptions you are making and creating posts like "it's no longer a useful currency" is spreading misinformation. Then again, we've seen a lot of that lately in this sub. It just suits the stand of a lot of people in here that sold recently hoping for it to go down and buy lower.
But hey, let's keep jumping in the bandwagon and join the circlejerk.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:11:53
I've edited my previous comment. Read it again please. Maybe you will now understand how the guy was with an attitude not appropriate of a reporter in a National TV show.

Don't be surprised if you start seeing posts of "I cashed out" and bullshit like that.
There are people with a lot of millions in Bitcoin that can make it seem like there's a crash or dip or whatever you want to call it.
Keep focus on one thing, Bitcoin hasn't changed in any way.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:44:56
This is a lot of new people buying. There are articles and news about Bitcoin in all mainstream media and people are starting to understand how it works.
Also, stop looking at it like for units and look in percentages.
This is just the same thing as going from $120 to $130, not that big of a deal.
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:49:37
Yeah, even just 14 Bitcoins don't make you one in a million, because I bet there's a LOT less people than a million that hold more than 14 bitcoins.
Just a few bitcoins already make you one in a million.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:58:21
Again, don't believe everything you hear in this sub.
If he made 1.5k everyday, that means he needed to have at least 30k in Bitcoin
to have 30k of Bitcoin in the beginning of the year, you would now have 600k. Dividing by 365 = 1.5k everyday just hodling, no day trading, guaranteed.
For every good trade he made, he made a bunch of bad ones.
Unless you have massive amounts of funding, you are not a market maker.
If you have massive amounts of funding, you can easily make tons just hodling.
If you are not a market maker and don't have massive amounts of funding, you can't guess when whales buy or sell.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:03


No, the bubble was .com companies in 2000, not the internet itself.
Gheeez, no wonder people call bubble everything, they don't even know what exactly a bubble was.
Saying the internet was a bubble is the same thing as saying stocks were a bubble in 2009.

Have you noticed how pretty much all exchanges have been flooded with new users in such a way they go down?

yeah, but it's a lot smaller. You know that right?

All other markets are in the trillions and above and this little guy is preocupied with a few billions in Bitcoin.
People who think Bitcoin at $17k is a bubble are really bad at finance, considering Gold market alone is in the trillions and doesn't provide half the utility that Bitcoin provides.

@_date: 2017-12-03 11:20:22
Not exactly. It's a cloned asset, but cloned asset can only be used in new fork and original asset in old fork. It still makes it unique in each fork.
If MS word app uses the original blockchain to authenticate, new cloned asset won't open there, if that makes sense.

Because you can always buy back after spending.
Because everyone has their selling price.

It's bullshit and there's thousands of people using their Bitcoin every day.

This is their goal.
The reason why they say "any time soon" is because banks take forever to make a decision or develop something. Burocracy is the problem here.

I don't know if they imposed any limit to europeans from leaving Greece with cash on hand. If not, then any European can travel to Greece and leave with up to 10 000 euros in cash.
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:34:24
Greece is imposing capital controls, which means **you can't withdraw more than 60 eur/day** and **you can't transfer euros internationally** unless you have authorization from ministry of Finance. **Credit cards are not accepted in most parts** now because people can't withdraw the money they charge to credit cards anyway.
Having Euros in cash is a really bad idea because you can get robbed. 
So there's tons of advantages in having Bitcoin. Bitcoin overcomes all these obstacles.

It depends where you look for it. There's scammers everywhere, that's the point I was trying to make with the Nigerian Princess. There's scams in e-mail, in bitcoin, in dollars.
The point I was making it's scamming is independent of currency, so it's not directly related.
Where I'm from, old people get scammed a lot and it's in Euros, not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:35:51
I was thinking just that. I wonder if this is in fact the way to go. First get the street crowd and stores.

Not sure why you were downvoted, but this is very true. We don't want to see a post everytime it goes up $20 or $30.
As well as I didn't want to see a post everytime it went down $20 or $30.
It's just the sort of post that atracts children and trolls.

You pointed out one current disadvantage towards Mastercard, which is just a fork away and being planned.
Here's a few Mastercard disadvantages:
- 3% or more fees
- Prone to thefth, just one picture of your Credit Card and that's it.
- Lack of anonimity, you have to provide name and address most of the times
- More difficult to program
Just to name a few. 
I can understand that for you it might not be interisting, but in a subreddit dedicated to Bitcoin, don't be surprised if people feel enthusiastic and informed about this Technology.

I think a lot of people have already realised it and that's why the price is not going down anymore, even after the Gox news. 
The constant buy walls on the biggest exchanges and huge sell offs at market price show the manipulation on the exchange end.
The constant DOS attacks on exchanges, online wallets or bitcoin related websites.
If those are related I don't know, but there are people who still think this is a conspiracy theory though and constantly downplaying it.

That's why I would want to know the fee structure. Mostly because who will guarantee me that you haven't used an optimal amount for reduced WU fees and maximum BTC fees, for example.

This is a subreddit dedicated to a new technology, created and promoted by people who believe in this technology. Saying there's fanaticism and circlejerking here it's like saying there's fanaticism and circlejerking in a church.
Sure there's religious extremists, but accusing everyone in the church of being fanatic because of their beliefs is just plain dumb.
If you are an atheist, enter a church and accusing everyone of being fanatics, then you are the douche. You need to learn to live in a society where everyone has their right to expression and to have beliefs.

Bitcoin is a network available 24/7, as such its dynamics are different from all other assets. It's accessible across the globe and never sleeps. Which means when it grows, it grows really fast. You can't compare it to the stock market, or gold, or any other asset. But hey, keep living in the past.

Selfish is an egocentric person who only wants profit or pleasure for himself. Obviously not my case as I wouldn't believe in Bitcoin as a concept.
Look, Bitcoin was invented as a world changing tool, for the better. To give a shot for everyone to have their financial service without the need for banks or central finance institutions.
So whenever I see someone against it, or betting against it, I question their motives. Someone who takes pleasure against a tool that will favor the poor and/or unbanked. That to me is being selfish.

I didn't get interested earlier because of similar reasons. I thought it woudl be great when it started being accepted, but at the time it was just trading/exchange, so I didn't see any reason for me to use it. But I do remember thinking, if it started being accepted, it would be incredible!
However, whenever there's a few thousands of people talking about it and news reports coming out every day for any technology, that's when I read all unbiased reports I can about it and make a decision.
In other words, in this day and age, more than ever, news reports are so biased that one needs to read from unbiased sources before making a decision. The reason being that everyone with a keyboard and whoring for page views claim whatever they see fitted for those page views.

Page views. Today what drives news is page views and clicks because of their sponsors. 
Unfortunately, general media and pseudo journalists (coindesk) nowadays push for sensationalist titles and stories, even if they don't reflect reality.
I've stopped checking Coindesk shortly after arriving in the Bitcoin scene. It was so apparent on almost every story.
It's a shame really as they could have conquered a bigger reader base if they were not just pushing for page views, which in the end, would probably have the same desired end result.

You are so right. But this seems like a lot of people want to bring the price down. 
Have you noticed the amount of MtGox posts in the first page of this subreddit? After MtGox being irrelevant for the last 6 months. The notion that it still affects Bitcoin price in other exchanges makes me laugh.
The amount of good news coming out in January and February should have shot the price up. But no, it rises for a bit then weird things happen in the charts.
Have you noticed the buy walls when the price starts ascending? And then you see just someone drop/sell a bunch of coins at no price limit.
I mean, if I had lots of coins and was greedy, I would do this exact same thing.

Wow, then the dollar must be 3 centuries out of date.
Seriously though, bitcoin is in its initial stages and will be largely developed. It wasn't thought to replace a currency in a few years. It was thought to replace a currency or currencies over a large amount of time. Decades.
Also, you realize inflation is the opposite of deflation. Which means negative inflation is deflation. Which means we already have it in some scenarios today. Which means you can use the same measures of inflation to deflation, if you just invert them.

Well, let's indulge his thoughts for a second and make some math:
Global Wealth: 240 trillion dollars
Bitcoins in 2030: 20 million
So that's around 12 million dollars per bitcoin. This is of course assuming all wealth would be stored in Bitcoin, which it won't. There's so many things that can influence this over time, that makes it very difficult to predict or even come close enough to a prediction.
And one has to remember, the price of Bitcoin is not what it is worth, but what people are willing to pay for it.

While I agree that a better consensus algorithm would be nice, remember, Bitcoin just needs to be good enough.
A lot of people mention that if someone controls a lot of pools or these mining facilities, it becomes more centralized.
True, but after controling it, what is the incentive for an entity to bring it down?
Also, if an entity controls it, isn't it better for that entity to just use it for itself and keep running it?
And even if there's such an incentive to bring it down, this entity might succeed if they spend a lot of money to do this to Bitcoin, but there's already other crypto currencies with different algorithms that have a good decentralized mining base. Wouldn't people just switch to another crypto?
Also, the people who advocate for different consensus algorithm are people with interests in other algorithms.
It seems to me that enough momentum has been built into Bitcoin and to bring it down would need to be a gigantic operation, which is hard to find incentive for.

Yes, you can clearly hear butt-hurt people here as soon as price drops. I bet they got in Bitcoin thinking they would get rich quick, instead of seeing the useful Financial tool as it really is.
That's what people around these parts call "weak hands". They get angry at something that didn't quite pan out as they wanted. Blaming the technology instead of blaming the people around it. It's so short sighted it's funny.
And when price rises, you can hear them behave as kids announcing and commenting posts every time it rises $10.

First of all, most people don't know how the inner workings of fiat money works. 
Second, it doesn't take hours to learn how to operate bitcoin, it transfers like any other currency.
Third, you can open a bank account online, but you won't have authorization till they clear you, which takes hours.

some practices?
@_date: 2014-04-23 01:40:54
People continuously show lack of knowledge about how bitcoin works.
Mining Bitcoin. Pools are constituted by miners, which means one person controls the pool, but the miners have the power. If the miners leave, the pool has no power. When you say 4 people control over half of all mining, you mean 4 pools control over half of all mining. That's like saying 60% of the population of a country control over half of all votes...
Talking about bitcoin. There's dozens of subreddits about bitcoin on reddit and we're not seeing posts being deleted left and right on bitcoin talk. So that's another non issue.
Development doesn't really matter. If we don't like the direction devs are taking, users/miners can easily fork to another direction. At the moment, they are doing a stellar job, so another non issue.
Number of nodes is just fine, stop being a cry baby...
I would go on, but honestly sorry, but I'm tired of these posts where you show basic misunderstanding of how the network runs. So I'm not even going to debunk the rest of your points.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:36:55

C'mon people. Don't assume something is bad just because you don't understand what was said.
They will be providing Financial and Security Audits to entities that want to operate in NY. So if MtGox or any other exchange wants to operate in NY, meaning be accessible from NY, they will have to comply with regulation.
Like he said, it's new territory for them and even traditional financial institutions should be complying with this sort of security audits that will be introduced with this regulation.

If I had tons of money, I would risk a tiny fraction there also, because if it payed off it would be an astronomical rate of profit.

My point is, the risk in MtGox was exponencially greater, compared to other exchanges in the last 6 months. This was clearly visible by reddit posts, forums posts, etc., yet people kept trading there, or even keeping their coins there. 
Even if one fell on the mistake of starting there, he/she should have gotten their coins out and registered in another exchange.
So, my conclusion is that people obviously there, were aware of the risks.

This post makes no sense.
The comparison is totally wrong.
Network effect doesn't mean much if you show an evolution or enhancement of the product/service. There's so many examples, look at Myspace and Facebook.
If there's enough incentive and/or evolution, people will change. It's just like a fork. And we know Bitcoin has already forked a few times. So there goes your theory out of the window.
Alt coins are just forks of Bitcoin. However, none of them made significant changes for people to feel incentive to change. Darkcoin has some pretty good caracteristics, but it's still not enough incentive for people to change, then again, it has increased value way more than Bitcoin.

No, they didn't. The Volume and consequently, the Market cap they have is magnitudes bigger than Bitcoin. So these currencies should be way more stable than Bitcoin.
If Bitcoin had the volume and and Market cap these currencies have, it wouldn't have gone nearly as low as it has.

Gox stopped existing for me when they stopped btc withdrawals for days blaming it on bitcoin protocol, instead of assuming their accountability for ignoring a problem for months.

In 2004 there was Mp3, DivX, huge sharing of media already. E-commerce like Ebay already had taken off. Paypal was also big by then.

They have a simlator for buy and sell.
It seems to me, from an european bank it would be something like 0.25 € + 2% for bank transfer + 0.0001 BTC + their fee 1%

@_date: 2014-04-23 19:31:55
No, bitcoin it's not all that. Only in your head and other misinformed people, like my grandma. Yes, some journalists don't have clue and write unfounded things about it. Yes, some people went day trading and lost money with it and now want to say "I told you so". But in general, from friends, family and people in general, there's a big interist.
Mt. Gox is no example. It wasn't a Bitcoin Bank, it was an exchange. And in that case, dollars are even more dangerous. Do you want to know how many people lost money to Madoff? And we're talking billions, not millions.
Government and other powerful entities already said it's legal and their stance about it.
Those of us who talk publicly, do not advocate, we educate.
And another thing, everyone, I mean EVERONE who I have explained how it works, ended up saying bitcoin is revolutionary.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:50:57
Like someone else said, this is just manipulation and probably a few people that are selling because they think it will go lower and they can buy cheaper. It doesn't make sense to you and me, because rationally everyone knew for a while that MtGox was bad news.

Yes, it's easier to steal from a credit card than from bitcoin. Mostly because you never give the private key with Bitcoin, but you give out the CVV code all the time. 
However, credit cards are insured, so they have advantage for the customer. I've heard of merchants losing the value from a stolen credit card transaction though.

@_date: 2014-07-24 10:24:37
Latelly it has been pretty stable actually.
The two main reasons that should convince you are:
- The fact that it is decentralize and there's no authority over Bitcoin. Meaning that something like [Operation Choke-point]( does not happen to you.
- It provides anonimity to your customers who use Bitcoin. There's no link between a person and his/her wallet address, so there's pseudo-anonimity.
Additionally, there's other factors which make it better than traditional money:
- It's instant. Transactions are instant globally. You do not have to wait days to get paid, or for your money to travel around the world before it gets to your account.
- It's definitive, transactions can't be reversed. This is great for merchants or service providers like you who get charge backs.
You should use Bitpay or Coinbase to implement it on your website. As for storing it, you can store it yourself or have a reputable company like Coinbase or Blockchain.info to store it for you without any cost, unlike banks who usually charge you money for storing your money.
As you can see, Bitcoin is not only a payment method, it's a bank, payment processor and many other things which don't need to be covered for now.
Also, don't forget to create another post publicizing your adult website in this subreddit when you start accepting Bitcoin. Bitcoiners love Adult entertainment!

Like the OP said, it's unprecedented and it has caracteristics that no other currency has. That alone easily justifies the speed it's growing at.
No other currency can be transfered universally in less than an hour, without borders. This alone is already big, but wait, there's more.
Without a 3rd party! Wait, there's more.
You can store it safely yourself without needing anyone else! Wait, there's more.
Can not be copied, cloned or counterfeited! Wait, there's more.
It's scarce and it's divisible infinitely.
You don't have anything else that's even close to this, thus why the value is rising this fast. In fact, the only reason I think it's not rising faster is because these properties are not easily understandable for the regular person. Also, usability is also still being worked on.
Although companies like Coinbase are already making it pretty easy to use.
Wait till you see more companies like Coinbase pop around the world and you'll see how fast it will rise.

You know what? I'm not believing any more of these posts. I will only believe if you post proof (screenshot of your deposit in gox's account or something similar).
The reason why I'm not believing is because no one risks their whole life savings and/or hard work on something like this.
First of all, whoever saves all his life wouldn't risk it all in a gamble like this. It's just contradictory.
Someone who saves all his life, does research about investing. Knows better than just invest everything in bitcoin. No one is that stupid. And if he was, he would never be bright enough to have saved 250k in the first place.
And then would hide it from his wife but would admit it to everyone how dumb he was when making such a move? Yeah riiiiight.

I hear you, however, I never saw (6 months ago) any reviews with other exchanges where people could not withdraw their USD. That for me was the BIG NO NO about MtGox. It scared the hell out of me that I would not be able to withdraw the money I put in. 
In fact, I kept reading, for these 6 months, reports and reports from people in MtGox that could not withdraw their USD. Why would anyone open an account with them or deposit any funds, with these reports, is beyond me. Unless of course you would want to take the risk. In which case, here's the consequences of that risk.

Yes, basically is for nothing because nothing official came out of Chinese Banks or Central Bank.
To me this seems a lot like someone was shorting BTC and wanted the price to go down. And they successfully created a panic. Or maybe it wasn't a panic. Maybe a lot of traders are playing the market and sold thinking they knew the play.
If someone is making money, someone else is losing it. Hopefuly that person who lost it will learn the lesson.

The key thing here is that Glenn Beck went to talk with Andresen Horowitz folks in a Silicon Valley.
They informed him Bitcoin's basics, even though he didn't understand it very well. But he did get how it could revolutionize the world.
If everyone else would be informed this way, with facts instead of personal opinion bullshit, Bitcoin would go forward much faster.
The problem is that Journalists are currently on pageviews trend where facts don't really matter anymore, but sensationalist headlines and opinions are above facts. So they present stories with misconceptions and misinformation about how Bitcoin works. 
So this is the obstacle that Bitcoin is facing, even so it's making huge steps forward and that's what matters.

That is great that it works so well in the UK, but it's not reality in other countries. I know from experience it takes about 5 business days for internation countries from US to Europe. In Portugal, which is part of EU, it is instant if within the same bank and about 2 business days for different bank in the same country. 
What baffles me is this was happening till 2009, when I could transfer music or video instantaneously, but I couldn't transfer money as quickly which is a much more important asset? So basically, what I'm saying is thank you, Bitcoin.

But bitcoin is "backed" by its properties and features. 
Even if they don't want to believe in a currency that is not directly backed by something physical, how about they believe it because it's independent of 3rd party, scarce, decentralized, transferible throughout the world in less than an hour, 24/7, nearly free and absolutely secure.
That alone gives it a ton of value. Try doing that with gold.

C'mon people. Don't assume something is bad just because you don't understand what was said.
They will be providing Financial and Security Audits to entities that want to operate in NY. So if MtGox or any other exchange wants to operate in NY, meaning be accessible from NY, they will have to comply with regulation.
Like he said, it's new territory for them and even traditional financial institutions should be complying with this sort of security audits that will be introduced with this regulation.

It has been working for a few years. It doesn't make it impossible to fail, but it has proven to be very solid, plus, there's a lot of people interisted and working in it to succeed.


One thing I've learned in life is that no one cares about you, except family or close ones. I've seen banks go bankrupt with people's money and people lost their life savings. The advantage of Bitcoin is that YOU take responsability for your money. When dollar loses value (like currently is losing against the Euro), who takes responsability for your loss?


Today I got paid in dollars from US via paypal. Paypal took a cut of 3%. However, I'm in Europe, which means I need to get it in Euros into my bank account. EUR to USD is 1.4 in paypal, but 1.38 in markets. This means they took plus 2% for exchange.
Another example, when I buy something in dollars on ebay, same thing happens, except 2% are taken from me, plus 3% from merchant. There's even worst examples.
With bitcoin you pay almost no fees, even on micro transactions internationally.

He's absolutely right and it's becoming that way slowly.
I have no problem in seeing people sell just because of a rumour. It kind of works as a filter. I know the shaky hands statement is a cliche by now, but truth is this market seemed to be held by a majority of shaky hands by the end of last year. 
Now is becoming more rubost, which leads to less volatility.

People don't realize that it's in companies best interest to accept Bitcoin. They are the ones that will probably make most of the money in relation to credit cards or other forms of payment. 
Because using Bitcoin they will no longer pay the absurd fees for the other forms of payment. 
I understand crowfunding, but is this company a startup? Do they not have any profit currently? Having the customers fund their Bitcoin development is just ridiculous. But hey, be my guest and pay them, it's your money.

@_date: 2014-12-17 12:56:28
You need to learn more about Bitcoin, then you can come here discuss it without false claims.
The $300-$500 million you made up is the predicted supply, it's not to pay transactions. It also works as an incentive to authenticate transactions. Incentive, not reward. Also, it's that value because it's what people are willing to pay for it.
It is not $300-$500 because it will all depend when they are traded for USD, if they will ever. So, you just spew a bunch of nonsense, now go study.

Ah got it. Well then maybe this is something that should be brought up to the regulators.

Right, but seems to me at this point, gold is rarely used because of being too expensive (due to gold market speculation), so it's too expensive to be useful. So there goes it's utility value.
Maybe I'm wrong, but while trying to understand where gold price value comes from, seems more about speculation and less about utility.

- You already created a post days ago which people told you that 25 Gb for the blockchain is not that big of a deal. It's the equivalent to two 3D movies. If I can hold the whole blockchain in a $4 USB drive, I'm fine with it.
- we are at an average of 2 transactions per second, let's worry about 7 (more than double) when we get there.
- Transaction fees are pretty low and as people said, sometimes you don't even need to pay a fee if you are not in a hurry for multiple confirmations.
- There are already fulltime core developers.
- Bitcoin doesn't need improved UI. It's a protocol, you are saying something like, let's improve internet's UI..
You sound very misinformed.

Before everyone starts saying Bitcoin has performed worst, think about the volume, and consequently, the Market cap these currencies have is magnitudes bigger than Bitcoin. So these currencies should be way more stable than Bitcoin. For freak sake, they have the backing of governments super powers.

I don't know if my question is hard, but, you say 


Right now, you created 38500 coins for each BTC you sell. Which means those 38500 were created out of thin air, since the hard drive is not being rented yet. That's why I was asking how did you create those storjcoins you are selling. Do you understand my question now?
In other altcoins there's a mining process, but here we haven't even started mining. So this is why I am not understanding where those coins are coming from.

How long does it take for you to wire money to someone in different countries? Also, for micro transactions you don't need confirmations.

Interisting the responses on this thread in less than an hour.
Makes me think a lot of people around this subreddit use Bitstamp daily for speculation and market play.
So they probably keep their stakes in the exchange because when you have your balance in dolars, you can't really withdraw without taking a few days. Once again, FIAT proves to be dangerous.

You are basically affirming what I just said. 
Why do you think I posted the link?
I said, it's impossible to mistype a correct address by error. You have to do it on purpose.
If you use a mistyped address (bad keyboard input), the transfer will not go through. For example, a litecoin address.
The only way a transaction goes through is if you enter a correct address, copy &amp; paste.

Actually, considering the volume required to make such a drop in the rubble, I would say the rubble was actually the worst currency.
Rubble's volume is magnitudes higher than Bitcoin.
Rubble is backed and pumped by a superpower government.
Rubble is used by more than 100 million people.
Still, it lost this much value?! Bitcoin was not worse than that.
These pseudo-journalists need to start being intelligent on what they write and analyse all the facts. You have to consider volume when assessing a currency and not just percentage of value.
If not, then I will just create a private alt-coin, I'll pump it to hell, give it to a few people and I've got the best performing currency so far.

That's not what I said.
And you are ignoring history. ATMs came to save tellers time.
In the 80s, if you went to a bank and withdrew money you would not be charged any fee. Then ATMs showed up to save time to the tellers.
Anyway, you don't pay any fees for ATMs where I live. So there you have it.
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:30:26
I didn't agree on anything.
1st, You don't have the same numbers of transactions per month with bitcoin, so using bitcoin is actually cheaper for you.
2nd, Locally me or anyone else has the organization power you have on your bank.
I also pay 8 euros fees every month on my bank account.
If you want guaranteed savings, then yes, a bank account is your best option at this point. But don't thank your bank. They are lending your money to other people at a higher rate, so it's the least they can do, give you part of the profit they are getting with your money.
For everything else, there's bitcoin.

I'm from Europe, which means we deal with IBAN numbers to identify accounts, so it's a different system from you, which I'm guessing is in the states? Probably Asia is another different system. Anyway, the point is that it can take up to 5 days for that transfer you just mentioned. And I could do it in Bitcoin in just a few minutes. BIG difference. 
Plus, I don't have to give my personal information to a 3rd party identity to open an account and get you the money. 
I could go on and on about the advantages to transfer money, but it doesn't even stop there.
@_date: 2014-10-19 10:27:23

What they were proposing is a more efficient society than today. Of course, it still doesn't handle the transition to that psychological state. So it's considered to be utopian by many.

We all know that there were even trades of RealBTC for GoxBTC, so let's not play victim.
And I'm sorry for people who stored in Gox more than they could afford to lose, but they now know they should not do this again. It's not because of lack of warnings. Pretty much all governments warned about the risks.

Why Suprisingly? The other exchanges resolved their problems quickly. (sigh) Gox is not a relevant exchange anymore. Why is media becoming more stupid every week?

Exactly, which is not a suprise since Gox has not been that relevant for a while now.
@_date: 2014-03-12 09:50:15
That is a great idea, I would tip too. 
Bittorrent now has a bitcoin address you can tip to associated to each torrent. Unfortunately the uploader is the one who defines that address. So anyone can upload the movie and collect profits. However, if we had a way to verify identities in bittorrent, we could make sure we would download only from trusted sources (studios).
To be honest, the technology has been there for a while. Heck, look at netflix making money out of a similar business model. Bitcoin just makes it a lot easier as a means of payment.
But guess what, studio suits are not paying attention.

Right, because if you buy one million dollars in bitcoins, that's not going to raise any warnings by banks and exchanges.

Really? It only took them a few months.
@_date: 2014-09-16 09:19:08
Just because the market cap is at 6.2B, it doesn't mean people have injected that amount.
13 Million Bitcoin x $470 = 6.2B approx.
But there's no way you can sell 13 Million Bitcoin at that price. The price would go down as a rock.
You would need pretty complex math to figure out how much was injected in Bitcoin, but I would say it was a small fraction of 6.2B. Market cap it's not directly representative of total value.
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:21:18
Maybe Bitcoin is not for you if you don't think it works for you.
So first you are talking about a gift card, then you talked about cash. Can't you see that Bitcoin is those two things and more?
For me it's great. I've invested some last year and still do now and then.
I use it for online and offline shopping, I keep some as an investment and I ask to be paid with it when sending work abroad. The amount of Paypal fees I avoided makes it a great tool for international payments. I just wish I could use it all the time and ditch $$ payments.
It is so much more of what you described and it does so much more that I could ever make in Reddit thread.

It seems you are starting the circlejerk of being anti-circlejerk.
Bank SEPA transfers to any exchange in Europe takes at least 2 days and up to 5 days.
Also, exchanges don't have some of the features like buyback or vault.
So Coinbase brings a lot to the table that Europe hasn't had before.

Not true. You can have an opinion based in misinformation, which what is happening with Bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2014-05-06 12:44:49
There's no fraud here.
TL;DR is this guy is running a bot and it's making really small transactions, fee ends up being $0.01, can't be lower than that. Which a lot of very small transactions end up being a lot if a large number of transactions are made.
Bitstamp should limit transaction Order Time and Amount, so the order taker won't also pay a fee for small transactions.

That's a good point. I imagine maybe young people doing this, which it's ok, because they are young and they will have plenty of time to get more savings. 
So I'm sure whoever did that Stamp to Gox arbitrage, figured this price difference was because of Gox's liquidity and withdrawal problems. So they knew there was risk!

At this point the return on hardware is unknown.
There are mining calculators online, but those are innacurate because mining difficulty changes over time as new hardware comes in.
On January, return on hardware for alt coin mining would be around around 3 months, but in February it changed to 4 months and then mid Feb, it became 6 months. So if you got your hardware in January, you haven't gotten your return yet.
For Bitcoin Mining, return is even worse and investment is even higher.

Relax and don't be so extremist about bitcoin.
There are places for some altcoins, as long as they have intrinsic differences to Bitcoin. 
Maidsafe is one of them. It provides incentive to share hard drive space you are not using. This is another. It provides incentive to bandwith you are not using.
I'm hoping someone will come up with gfx processing sharing. Like for render farms that animation studios use so much.
It's a way of providing incentive to share resources one is not using. I'm all up for it.

Whenever someone invests their money, they should make sure they get informed enough about knowing all or most of the risks. 
I feel most people who value their money and know what they are in for, have not touched their Bitcoins or sold them, because they read and analyze news well before making a decision.
This fall is just proving there's a lot of shaky people playing market, trying to make a quick buck without really believing in or having read about the whole technology and getting hurt because they have no experience trading. So they panic on every big movement.

It is quite possible government walk in and took it all. They did it with SR, why not with Gox?
However, he could have said that to his customers when it happened. Nothing prevented SR guy from saying government grabbed SR bitcoins. Why would Gox not be able to say it? He wouldn't even need to mention anything about the investigation. Just say that their reserves are captive because of an investigation. That's not against the law.
So being that he has history of fraud, I wouldn't be surpised if he was making this up.

Every user/miner working together gives the guarantee of the system. Right now, thousands of people. It's like a democracy where everyone has a vote and works together to secure a future. Plus, they get rewards for securing this future.


The current system seems to work for some countries. But if you check the financial history of countries like Zimbabue, Argentina, Cyprus, Iceland, just to name a few. You will see the current system doesn't work. 
You should switch because of a number of reasons, but mostly because it's a decentralized, deflationary, secure, easy to transfer and fast to use system. In comparison to other physical or digital systems.


There's different reasons for everyone, besides what I just explained above, I also like the idea of having multiple bank accounts for savings, each account for each goal. And I have control of My accounts, not a bank that can go bankrupt.
Additionally, all over the world, there's people without access or power to have a bank account, so bitcoin is a secure way to store their money. Plus, without seeing it devalue.


Why not? Being that everything else is being digitalized, it seems rather dumb not to digitalize the most important thing in the world. Besides, all these properties and advantages of digitalizing cash.

Another good demonstration of incompetence as a journalist and an economist. 
Have they realized that deflation is just inverted inflation? That all the rules or good practices we have for inflation (like yearly salary increase, or rent adjustment, or price adjustment on goods) will apply in the same but inversed?
That goods, salaries, services prices will be adjusted constantly, just like they are with any other currency. This is Math 101 and why is it so hard for an economist to understand this?

Still, imagine a company that provides Bitcoin credit card, where you have a certain amount of credit, with interest, like most credit cards today. But you can pay for it without incurring in 3% fees for the merchant on every transaction. That's what was trying to say.

Bitcoin won't get blocked like her bank account could be, because of Justice Department's operation Choke Point.
So this is a pratical example of how Bitcoin is giving financial freedom to the unbanked.

@_date: 2014-02-20 11:56:05
How people did not get their BTC out of Gox in time is beyond me. Since I've entered Bitcoin scene mid last year that I've been hearing problems with fiat withdrawals from Gox in reddit, forums, blogs and news sites, thus why I've stayed away of Gox when I bought btc.
Everyone knew the disparity in Gox price was because of difficult withdrawals. I'm guessing people stayed with them accepted the risk. Now, unfortunately, they found the consequences of that risk.
I understand people want to recover their investment and they want to involve everyone in the community. But truth is the community was expecting this to happen for a while.
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:50:51
No it doesn't. I'm a developer and I can tell you software does not require constant development and maintenance. It has an initial development process and then it has an initial maintenance process while there are bugs to be resolved. After that, as long as it's scalable, it will work just fine.
At most there could be variable maintenance, not constant.

A lot of nay sayers are missing the difference is that Bitcoin can be all of those things at the same time. So you just need one tool to do multiple tasks. Not like using cash, credit cards, banks, etc...
Cash doesn't require a credit check but you can't use it online. It can also be counterfeited.

I am also a software developer, so I understand what you mean, however, they really are competent. Andreas is their chief security officer and he is one of the most fluent and knowledgeable about Bitcoin. Also they apply the best practices to their system, so I know for a fact.

And then blogs quote other blogs, it's so amateur hour that I won't even comment the article itself.

So it's just a weapon as gold. Actually less than gold, because there's a blockchain with bitcoin, there's no blockchain with gold.

Every user/miner working together gives the guarantee of the system. Right now, thousands of people.


The current system seems to work for some countries. But if you check the financial history of countries like Zimbabue, Argentina, Cyprus, Iceland, just to name a few. You will see the current system doesn't work. 
You should switch because of a number of reasons, but mostly because it's a decentralized, deflationary, secure, easy to transfer and fast to use system. In comparison to other physical or digital systems.


There's different reasons for everyone, besides what I just explained above, I also like the idea of having multiple bank accounts for savings, each account for each goal. And I have control of My accounts, not a bank that can go bankrupt.
Additionally, all over the world, there's people without access or power to have a bank account, so bitcoin is a secure way to store their money. Plus, without seeing it devalue.


Why not? Being that everything else is being digitalized, it seems rather dumb not to digitalize the most important thing in the world. Besides, all these properties and advantages of digitalizing cash.

I agree with you that hardware wallets are good step forward and help those who do not want to be educated or losing time doing so.
But yes, it is as much for the average Joe. Bitcoin was created to help everyone. Let the geek elitist crap out of this. We should be educating people about computer security, not Bitcoin security. Computers are where the weak link is. I know a lot of people that still don't use their Credit Cards on their computers because of this lack of security or know how.
Also, companies like Neo &amp; Bee and Coinbase are adivising their customers how Bitcoin works and need to advise their customers on how to secure their computers the most they can.
Average Joe needs to learn about this as much as he needs to learn how to drive if he wants to use a car.

At this point it is only risky for those who have not read enough about it and understand how it works. Bitcoin has gone through Silkroad, China ban, Gox fiasco, China ban again and again a week later and it still strides. At this point it has built enough momentum to avoid being stopped.
The only thing that can stop it is itself, by some unpredictable result in the code. And even those odds are pretty slim as it is open source and it has tons of eyes looking at it.

I don't think one can look into history to compare Bitcoin. Never in the history of mankind something with store of value has been so easily connected across the world in such scale. Even Fiat is not as easily transfered/connected as Bitcoin. As such, you can't expect it to behave as anything of value we've seen in history or compare it with Roman coins, Dutch Tulips or whatever. This is what most media doesn't get.

You know, none of your points make sense, it's like hearing politicians speak.
1. Mining pools is constituted by tons of miners, so mining pools are actually decentralized. So even if there is 10 significant pools, they are at their core, decentralized by its constituents.
2. The core-dev team makes a decision but it has to be implemented by decentralized miners, so in the end, the miners or hosts (which are thousands) are the ones who make the call.
3. So you are comparing a network effect to centralization? You see the nonsense that is?
4. You do realize that some of those accounts are actually owned by exchanges which makes those bitcoins owned by tons of traders.
5. Wasn't this related to your point 1? Define a few? A few are actually hundreds.
6. Define few again, I count a few hundreds, which to me is a lot. And if you count localbitcoins users, then you will see thousands.

It's the new way of making money! You post a rumour of China ban, price drops, then you buy a bunch of Bitcoin while price is dropping (cheap coins), put a sell wall at way above what you bought, then you just wait your rumour to be proven false and watch the price eat your sell wall. Easy money!

Scrypt-n is different from Scrypt as it requires gfx memory aside from processing power. If you implement a Scrypt-n ASIC, you are basically creating a gfx card. So you will basically be competing with gfx card manufacturers. I doubt you can get lower prices than them.
Litecoin's devs error was when they simply refuse to update the algo when scrypt ASICs came out. This is not going to happen to Vertcoin for example. Devs are determined to stay away from ASICs and have already admitted they would happily change algo.

Only reason is because they want to get to the bottom of it, so they really need to go through the whole process to identify the bug. The reason why they asked you for your password is because they don't store passwords on their side.
They don't ask for password unless there's a really good reason for it. You don't need to be worried to handle them password to an empty account anyway. If it still had BTC; then it would be a completely different story.

Right, because the euro has been doing so well.... not
For those who don't know, there were european elections this weekend and voters showed their discontent towards current government.
Extreme right parties won in a lot of counties in europe, like in France,
Because people are really unhappy with the Euro and current european policies.
And Euro, at this point, is supposed to be making more steps to become stronger than the dollar, as its value has shown in the last year.
So, in conclusion, europeans are beggining to be fed up with the government and their financial governance.

Alex Green has stated multiple times he uses his own personal funds to tips, events and charities.
Alex Green (Moohla) is an active Dogecoin and Vertcoin community member. So I'm not sure why this was posted here. Don't get me wrong, I'm not into dividing crypto crowd, but it would get more attention by Doge community I think.
From what I've seen so far, it's not the first time someone questions Alex Green's business and it has been dealt with. Most often in Doge community.
However, I do think the post is partially correct and just asking for proof of solvency is something any crypto community should be entitled to.
Don't assume the man is guilty until proven otherwise. Just ask him for proof of inocence before considering him guilty.
This post is in here and in OP didn't back the posts with any links to his accusations.
There's plenty other exchanges who there's not even a name, company or face associated with it. However, here's this guy Alex Green, who has contributed imensely to doge community with fund raisers, charity, tips and enterpreneurship, being accused of being a scam.

1. Bitcoin can only go down
2. Bitcoin really doesn't help the poor. It's just for the rich with mining farms and those who have money to invest
3. Losing your coins is everyone's fault but yourself. In fact, everything bad that happens to you, is everyone else's fault.
4. Everyone already invested or bought Bitcoin. Too late to get in Bitcoin.
5. Bitcoin has serious technical or scalability issues. In fact, devs are dumb and I'm the only smart guy who thought of these problems ahead of anyone else.
6. Economy must work only has I know it works and the only way it has been proven. 
7. Cash, Credit Cards and Banks are the only way safe to use money. In fact, we should be paying 10% on every transaction for the enormous amount of work the banks have in each transactions. And those new wireless credit cards? Oh, those are so safe and easy to use.
8. Everything should be regulated. Even stairs should be regulated so that whoever is distracted enough to fall on them can sue the builders.
&lt;end troll the troll&gt;
There's always two sides of a coin and not everything is black and white. Discussion is healthy, but destructive criticism is easy, unproductive and often a mirror of deeper issues.
I really feel sorry for those people or anyone who loses a lot of time in here when they don't believe in Bitcoin. Fine if you don't have a good opinion about it. Make your point and move on, don't keep trolling, that's not how you change the world, even if you could.

I've thought about this, Banks and Governments might be crazy enough for it.
Remember, that entity needs to gain more than is spending with its destruction. Lets imagine that a bank loses to Bitcoin more than 1 million dolars in fees daily (which is a very weird scenario), but it would be incentive for a Bitcoin attack. They would need to buy a lot of mining hardware to have more than 51% mining power. That is very expensive.
If they did this, the 51% attack is pretty limited and at that point another solution could be implemented, like another algorithm.
Bitcoin would continue, that entity would have spent a lot of money for a meaningless attack.

It is not a 100% sure thing, but I would say around 95%.
There's 2 things I can see it bringing it down: 1st, a bug in the protocol that wasn't predicted. 2nd, the competitors (banking industry being the one with a lot more to lose) could create an advertising and media battle against it. These 2 reasons are the 5%.
People have a lot to gain from digital currency. Besides, Dollars and other FIAT currency are already digital. Why's that? Because it has a huge amount of benefits.
Also, Bitcoin has been extremely resilient even with China ban, Media misunderstanding and bashing, Gox fiasco, China ban again and again a week later. Even Gold is losing value at an enormous rate and it hasn't been bashed like this.
You are correct, one should not invest anything they can't afford to lose, there's still those 5% that can go wrong.

Sensationalist title. Are you a reporter by any chance?
@_date: 2014-05-31 10:54:23
To reinforce what you said and why it's value is rising so fast. It's unprecedented because it has caracteristics that no other currency has. That alone easily justifies the speed it's growing at.
No other currency can be transfered universally in less than an hour, without borders. This alone is already big, but wait, there's more.
Without a 3rd party! Wait, there's more.
You can store it safely yourself without needing anyone else! Wait, there's more.
Can not be copied, cloned or counterfeited! Wait, there's more.
It's scarce and it's divisible infinitely.
You don't have anything else that's even close to this, thus why the value is rising this fast. In fact, the only reason I think it's not rising faster is because these properties are not easily understandable for the regular person. Also, usability is also still being worked on.
Although companies like Coinbase are already making it pretty easy to use. Wait till you see more companies like Coinbase pop around the world and you'll see how fast it will rise.

In spite of Bitcoin being a lot safer than credit cards, you should still use multi sig wallets to avoid any kind of hacking. Even so, I'm sure those same services will also be created for bitcoin in the future.
How long did it take for Credit Cards to be insured? I'm sure it wasn't right when they were created.

Bitcoin is by far the blockchain with most network effect, thus the most secure and the most valuable. The amount of infrastructure around it is huge already. How can it not be the network of choice when this is the most important feature about the network security. 
This is what most people in this sub are trying to get at, but the smart people haven't caught up yet. You know why? Because they are trying to get around it. There is no getting around it. Blockchain without Bitcoin is just another Ledger.

I think if gold was not used for financial speculation and store of value, it would be used a lot more industrially, making some cheaper products like in eletronics. But just a bit cheaper, nothing noticeable.

You are the one using the trust word.
Again, that's not what I said. All the actions from MtGox in the past 6 months have been dubious. Seized account in the US, Multiple complaints of not being able to withdraw USD after they moved out of the US. Those actions raise red flags to me. So definitely not trust this exchange.
The whole point of bitcoin is that it is decentralized. No one controls your money except yourself. You don't have to trust anyone. You can store your bitcoin yourself, where you and you alone have access to it. And even if you don't want to go through the trouble of creating a wallet, you can use Blockchain.info, where you and you alone have access to your bitcoins and your private key.
But even if you have to trust your money to an exchange for a few moments, do what you need to do and withdraw your bitcoins. This way you are exposing yourself to the least risk possible.

Obviously, you don't understand m-of-n multi-sig.

@_date: 2014-09-16 09:56:17
You say unnecessary work right now because usage is not high enough to justify $470 value. But imagine if there were 100 Million people using Bitcoin every day, you would need these miners to process these transactions. I don't call that unnecessary work.
The $470 value of Bitcoin right now is because of speculation, People are anticipating that Bitcoin is going to be very useful in the future, so they bought and hold it.
It all depends on supply and demand. If there's not enough demand right now, then the price goes down.
However, a lot more merchants and transaction record highs are being broken every day, so demand is increasing.

Second of all, never in time has something like Bitcoin existed.

And the receiving person can use that Bitcoin value also instantly. All this with such a wide acceptance is unheard of.

Yeah this is not a coincidence. Lately whenever Bitcoin hits a new high, these news come up and you see the shorts growing like crazy. You also see some people selling huge chucks trying to create a perceived "Massive Dump". Fortunately, most Bitcoin holders are already experienced on this.

It's like I need to become a rocket scientist every time I need to do a Bitcoin transaction to figure out which fees to use. And I'm a developer. I can only imagine what the regular Joe would think about this.
With these high fees, most of the decentralization goes down the drain, since you can't use it for daily use. You can only use Bitcoin to horde and even then you need to become a rocket scientist to figure out the fees any time you need to buy or sell.

Don't take it personal. I'm saying the whitepaper has a sensationalist title. It uses complicated "smart" writing to confuse users into thinking that Bitcoin has a bug.
The reality is that offline wallets are not hackable, unless the computers they are in are compromised. But any technology that is compromised is not safe.
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:43:23

No, MtGox had reports of not committing to withdraws and issues with withdraws. Coinbase has had no similar issues thus far, so you can't make the comparison.
Coinbase, also has a feature where you get Vault keys to control your bitcoin, which means that even if Coinbase goes bankrupt, you control your bitcoin.

Explain it like this:
No other currency can be transfered universally in less than an hour, without borders. This alone is already big, but wait, there's more.
Without a 3rd party! Wait, there's more.
You can store it safely yourself without needing anyone else! Wait, there's more.
Can not be copied, cloned or counterfeited! Wait, there's more.
It's scarce and it's divisible infinitely.
You don't have anything else that's even close to this, thus why the value is rising this fast. In fact, the only reason I think it's not rising faster is because these properties are not easily understandable for the regular person. Also, usability is also still being worked on.
Although companies like Coinbase are already making it pretty easy to use. Wait till you see more companies like Coinbase pop around the world and you'll see how fast it will rise.

What a lot of altcoin invested people seem to miss, is that even if you let your funds in an altcoin while Bitcoin is going up, your altcoin is also going up because its price is in relation to Bitcoin.

Gheezz... the comments on this thread. This is how people receive a new user?
There's a few options for you to receive Bitcoins and "Cash out".
You need a receiving Bitcoin address and for that you need a wallet. You should search for Electrum 
To "Cash out" you can use Coinbase, Bitstamp or just LocalBitcoins depending on quantities. Please read more in depth about these before committing and do some tests with small quantities.
Let me know if you have any questions.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:01:22
Stop with the our, theirs, us, them conversation. This is about the technology and what's best moving forward, not a damn war.
If segwit solves the expensive transaction problem and gets us more transactions then fine, let's go.
If BU solves the expensive transaction problem and gets us more transactions then fine, let's go.
Stop acting like you are invested in any of those solutions, you are not. You are invested in Bitcoin and only want what is best for it.

Well kind of. It's just drama bullshit against BU like they are talking about a war, yet none of them even explain how they are supposed to block segwit. I'm neutral, I just want affordable transactions and don't care about solution. But I can see false accusations here because blocking segwit is technically impossible.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:12:15
This is fine because:
- 1st Bitcoin is not virtual, it's digital. It's as virtual as Euros. Sure, Euros can have paper bills, Bitcoin can have paper wallets.
- 2nd They have no control over Bitcoin or who owns it.
- 3rd Why is this article the top post when it's not even a reputable publisher?
- 4th Sources are from 2016 and 2015, why is it here now?
To me this seems more like one of those "&lt;Country&gt; bans Bitcoin" articles.

Oh ffs, can we stop with this attacking conversation of segwit vs BU? Either it's a constructing criticism or just leave it out of both subs! 
Users are getting sick and tired of the attacks on both sides.
The twats that think it's one vs the other are dumb as a nail. The politics is destroying the technology and deviating from science. Proof to that is the only thing they can do is personal attacks and avoid narrowing the conversation to criticize either solution.
Of course for people shorting the currency it's working like a charm, so maybe that's why we see a surge of these posts.

@_date: 2017-03-09 12:16:18
If BU goes through, it forks and there will be two solutions. Most of people on the core side should signal segwit pretty easily and there you have it. No one blocked shit. Bitcoin is free and open source, yet people love to paint doom and war. Stop believing the Drama queens.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:06:38
Well, realistically, you are only seeing one exchange and a huge buy. Anyone with enough money can do this. If you look at other exchanges, it didn't have this movement, they were pretty stable and only increased like $30, that's 2%.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:59:08
Thank you for the explanation, I think something similar to this should become a sticky on the sub so that people like me (there are many) realize what segwit enables.
When can this be implemented and are these channels ready for use as soon as segwit is accepted?
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:00:17

I also would like to have bigger blocks just for the fact that the fees are too high right now. However, I have an honest question, if the max block size rose to 8MB then could somebody spam the blockchain to keep at 8MB and fees would rise again?
I might be answering my own question, but would someone need to spend a lot of money on fees just to spam it and to compete with fees as high as the ones now?
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:35:48

Bitcoin is free (or used to be) to use by anyone. This is not a soccer match that is either one or the other.
BU forks the currency and you prefer the core? Fine, use one or the other, they are both available. No one is forcing you to use the other one. Stop painting the doom as it's the apocalipse war. The technology and blockchain will be fine.
Neutral people are looking at both sides like you guys are wack jobs.

I honestly can't understand why people gave so much importance to the ETF.
Bitcoin is a lot easier to acquire than an ETF. People from all ages and nationalities can get into Bitcoin. You download an app and that's it.
Also, a lot of traders were just hoping for some movement to make some money, so they just posted and posted and posted to make a sentiment that was a huge event. 
Well, guess what, Bitcoin raised a middle finger to that event. Traders lost with the $1350 spike and they will lose again with shorting it after the ETF.
This game is for HODLERS, not traders.

Bullshit. I've read every post in here and there's not technical possibility how they can force anyone to use anything.
Bitcoin is decentralized and open source. No one can tell me how I use it. When they fork, then everyone can either use one or the other. And people that use the non-BU can just implement segwit and move on their way.


There we go with the personal attacks. I think you should probably read both of your personal attacks and reflect on how you conduct these conversations. Focus on the conversation if it's that easy to state the facts. 


Really? show me the transactions.

1st, A journalist primary objective is to research their news stories, especially when they give a personal opinion about it. You don't need to go rocket science on it, but you should know about it.
2nd, If I only used in my work what I learn in college alone, I would be fucked. There's areas that are in constant development and everyone needs to keep updating.

I have no idea how Lightning works, so I'm probably asking stupid questions that a lot of people might also ask.
One of the advantages of Bitcoin is that if one node is tampered, others are there to relay the transaction. My question about lightning is if it's open, independent and decentralized like Bitcoin. No one owns it? and other nodes can relay the same information if one is tampered.

Bitcoin is a lot easier to trade than stocks.
This is common in currencies though if you look at last few years of Argentina, Russia, Britain, Venezuela. We're talking national currencies who are huge and have extreme fund backing.
EDIT: This only happened in one exchange, all others only saw an increase of $30. That's like 2%.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:31:18
The kind of discussion you are trying to make is drama and non-technical politics, which is unproductive as hell, which users of Bitcoin are sick and tired of.
@_date: 2017-03-11 13:54:36
This right here. It might actually be because of the halving and acceptance in general.

@_date: 2017-03-06 23:27:10


Well yeah, have you noticed the personal attacks on BU proponents instead of argumenting the logic?
As someone who is neutral because I don't have the technical knowledge to make a decision on each, I think attacking someone personally is really imature. And that's the view I have from some people in this forum.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:08:15
What's even more lame is the people they are attacking have the same objective. As a neutral, I find this hilarious. 
It's like an Agnostic watching Christians fighting Muslims.
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:47:18


This just sounds like fear mongering.
You should never have bitcoin in an exchange.
But If anyone is hacking an exchange, any time is as good as before.
@_date: 2017-03-11 13:51:38


Yes. I honestly can't understand why people gave so much importance to the ETF.
Bitcoin is a lot easier to acquire than an ETF. People from all ages and nationalities can get into Bitcoin. You download an app and that's it.
Also, a lot of traders were just hoping for some movement to make some money, so they just posted and posted and posted to make a sentiment that was a huge event.
Well, guess what, Bitcoin raised a middle finger to that event. Traders lost with the $1350 spike and they will lose again with shorting it after the ETF.
This game is for HODLERS, not traders, but traders will continue to spend their money trying to guess an unpredictable market.
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:03:55
I come here for development information on bitcoin and lately all I see is personal attacks 
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:32:35
Nope. No worries though, some people are starting to get it, that's why the price is climbing.
At some point, when they start to get it, we'll see headlines like "Bitcoin could resolve some financial troubles", "Bitcoin could help banks". It will take a while though.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:05:51


No, we are trying to keep it useful.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:26:23


Yeah, users should keep with facts and question everything. Drama, politics and war talk is for soap operas and movies. Usually people who start with personal attacks are the same who want to divide people even more.
Everyone wants bitcoin to be worth more. Miners, users, devs, etc. Everyone has a common goal. Segwit and BU are not mutually exclusive. I'm ok with both solutions, but I do see a lot of attacks and posts that disappear in this sub towards BU.
Bitcoin started focused on science and math and should be kept that way. It's what made it strong.
@_date: 2014-07-25 14:15:40
Gold is the product he is selling. He will never admit Bitcoin is better unless he's selling it.
Like you pointed out though, no one is trying to argue that except him, afraid that people will go to Bitcoin instead of Gold, to store their money in these times of fiat crisis.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:13:48


I don't want it either, but humans are humans and this is how democracy works. Yet some people are trying to turn this into a war because it can bring them profit.
Major players are fragmenting it, not the users. The users can chose to see this and tell them to shut up, or they can incentivise it by making even more posts attacking people and solutions.
That's why I started responding to this post because most of it is smoke drama bullshit to blind and enrage people. When you start asking for technical facts to prove their claims, none come forward.
HF might happen and if so there might be two solutions and people can then chose their sides, or just keep on both. It's never a us vs them situation, which some players in this sub like to make.

Even if a Billion dollars left China through Bitcoin, which it didn't because the price would go bezerk, it would just be 0.1% of a trillion dollars.
Besides, the disparity between prices in China and Europe/US would be insane, while they Buy in China and Sell in Western countries.
Bitcoin is not significant at all on the money leaving China, stop insinuating that.

I also experienced it first in 2013, but I always had the feeling it had to recover. I mean, the technology is just amazing and the advantages over every other financial asset is unmatchable. It had to recover, although I wasn't expecting to take this long.

I seriously don't get the comparison to gold, like some people call it the digital gold.
- You can't send gold across the world in less than an hour.
- You can't divide gold quickly.
- You can't authenticate gold quickly either.
- You can't carry gold around safely.
- You can't access your gold from anywhere in the world.
- You can't buy something online with gold.
I just don't get the comparison.
Bitcoin is a super asset that has never existed before and this seems what some people are missing.
Bitcoin is better than gold, better than currency and better than stock.

@_date: 2017-01-11 18:13:00


Didn't need to be in the early days... a bit more than a year ago there were coins at $300. If you sold at $1000 it's a 300% proft. I would say that's pretty good investment.
People only start paying attention to it while it's at higher prices because the press only looks at it then, but the truth is that Bitcoin was as useful then as it is now.

It's not as fast as it was in Nov 2013. It's slower this time.
It could be way way way faster if there was worldwide mainstream adoption. For now, it's just a few new people who have heard of it. 100% of the people I talk to which are not in the computer world, have no idea what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:20:42
Yes and I think it is required in China.
I've heard a lot of pointing fingers to exchanges in China when talking about faking volume, so this regulation might be good to put an end to either the fingers or the fake volume.

Of course it is. What did you expect? 
Did you think it was a coincidence this happened when Bitcoin reached $1100? 
Do you think the government is fond of a currency that they have absolutely no control of?
Can you imagine if Bitcoin started going up to the 2k, 3k and so forth? Everyone would start abandoning regular currencies and governments would tremble in devaluation.
Thankfully, for the chinese government is that people invested in Bitcoin are easy to scare and control with other means. Just a press release and BAM, everything back to the old days and everyone shitting on Bitcoin for how volatile it is.

Even a 50k transaction would win you a trip over to the bank to justify why and to who are you going to transfer the money to. So, it would take you time, money and patience.
At $18m it would make a lot more questions than just these.

Bitcoin has not lost any of the properties which makes it very useful.
So no, it's not the next tech bubble.
It might be a bubble when it surpasses stock market and even so, it will be a superior asset
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:15:39
You have to know how to spend it. It's not a currency for every day use. Especially because not everyone takes it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:52:33


Right now, you are the only one calling it that.


There might be a drop like with any markets, but I don't call that a bubble. A bubble is when something has a bigger price than its worth, which is certainly not the case. Bitcoin should be worth trillions more.

There are arbitrage bots between all the major exchanges, so whenever a big sell in one of the big ones, the bots will arbitrage on the other exchanges for profit.
People, keep in mind there are people that do this for a living, live off swings, arbitrage, day-trading. People that are good at math and have years of experience. These are people who won't have any problem in creating fake news articles/websites that "China bans Bitcoin" so it crashes the market and they take the profits. This is why you should HODL and not try to time the market.

These last few days have been very intense for Bitcoin, relax and give them some slack.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:41:54
That's not where the money is going.
A lot of people sold their Ethereum for Bitcoin, because they would basically have double the bitcoin after the fork.
Now money is going back to Ethereum because people realize s2x is not happening anymore, so the advantage of having all your money in Bitcoin to sell your s2x after the fork is no longer happening.

It has been said multiple times that people need to start looking at price in percentages.
It was just 10% in a week. That's nothing in Bitcoin.
When it reaches $50k, it will be $1000 in around an hour. You'll need a lot of updating this graph.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:36:31
I do find it funny that there's quite the few posts every hour to validate what they believe in.
Almost like politicians campaigning.
There was never this amount of posts when the first alt-coin clones of Bitcoin came up, yet quite a lot of people in here feel threatened by B2X
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:58:53


It was a fork, it was optional, no one made you do it.

This is your first mistake. Comparing it with a traditional asset.
It's highly undervalued when it comes crashing down, that's why it always goes back to magnitudes higher. What you call crashes, it's people underestimating it.

@_date: 2017-11-21 18:07:13
The way I see it is:
This sub, core devs and mods defend a 1MB blockchain forever, arguing that will keep it decentralized because John doe can run it on a raspberry.
The other sub, miners and mods, some of which are ex-core devs defend a bigger &gt; 1MB blockchain.
But this has been escalating for months, so now they are poiting fingers at each other and accusing them and their mother of being the devil.
I think you should always take a neutral approach and assess yourself what each group claims.
There are a few members of BitcoinCash community which are known scammers, which doesn't help their claims.

Paypal charges 3% on money you already paid tax on.

US won't ban it. Forget it.
There are already funds and big companies using it and it has taken off.
China can only ban exchanging it because of their dictatorial style governing. Nothing much else they can do.
And they risk Bitcoin taking off (even more) and being behind.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:48:26

Most people that say Bitcoin is a bubble, don't know what a bubble is.
Bubble is when an asset is far overpriced.
Bitcoin is arguably underpriced. In fact, there's no other asset like it in the world, which makes it unique and limited.
People scream bubble every time ATH is achieved because they have no idea what a bubble is. And that's why some people lose money in Bitcoin, because they want to daytrade it, but they have no idea how to analyze it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:01:10
Coinbase went down, but Bitstamp was up. What others were down?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:57:51
XRP centralized
LTC much lower mining power, less secure, less accepted
ETH I'll give you this one, but still not as easily available as BTC
DASH Can't find anyone that accepts this except some exchanges
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:34:53
And every one and each of these times, some people were shouting "Bubble" in the forums.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:02:51
If it were not for Coinbase, you wouldn't have 100.000 new users every day. Especially for people in the US, it's the exchange to use.
What have you done for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:02:36
I should be careful? I don't own one btc, let alone 21. What the hell?!
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:36:00


Why you're wrong:
- There's 16 days left. Way too long before fork
- Bicoin Cash is also rising like crazy and it's not going to fork.
- Alt coins drop is a fraction of what they fell in previous non fork falls.
It will rise a lot more because of what you said, but this is not it yet.
EDIT: Another fact to prove my point.
Coinbase just stated they added 100,000 new users this week. That's the real reason for 7k
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:09:14
like a 4 year-old
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:14:45
Any of those exchanges are meaningless.
Also, you've never seen this before. This is mainstream adoption.
I've been hearing this "bubble" and "event" since 2k.
You guys are just hoping for a crash so you can short it and buy in lower.
People should be aware is that there will be fake "China bans bitcoin" rumors like in 2013.
@_date: 2015-08-06 11:35:10


aka blockchains.
So, some companies use "blockchains" for closed, centralized ledgers, but other companies don't use it for open, decentralized ledgers.

So sounds to me like you never gave Bitcoin much importance then. You would have sold them by now. You are only giving them importance now because they are valuable and useful.
Usually people that hodl them are people that realize their importance and usefulness thus realizing how valuable they are going to be in the future.

@_date: 2017-11-29 11:50:36
Of course it is. And it's not going to threaten any economy. If bitcoin really takes off and gets in the tens of trillions, it means the economy is getting in bed with Bitcoin, not getting threatened by it.

If I want to store value without a third party, there's only one asset that can do that, Bitcoin.
If I want to pay for something on Amazon without incurring in exchange fees, with a discount, there's only one asset that can do that, Bitcoin.
So you're ignoring the utility of this unique asset so you can call it speculative. Keep lying to yourself.

It was abandoned, which means they hear what customers say. S2X is gone. Learn that people have opinions and change them.
What Coinbase has done for Bitcoin easily surpasses the fact they thought S2X might be a good idea.
Besides, it was a fork, which means people were free to chose which side they wanted.
Also, it was abandoned, which means they hear what customers say.

Depends on the company, but most likely I would leave Bitcoin and just go for another crypto. As I'm guessing a lot of people would and Bitcoin would lose its value.
I've said before and say it again. Bitcoin is not like other currencies or assets. We have not seen anything like this before and its behavior is not traditional as other assets.
Would a company risk their capital like this? Most unlikely. Why would they when they have other ways of achieving profit.

Blockchain is nothing without bitcoin protocol. Blockchain is just a ledger, a database. What makes it trustless and secure is decentralization, or in other words, the Bitcoin protocol.
Bitcoin is soaring because of its decentralization

No, they were wrong. Bitcoin prices goes up and down like any other asset. A bubble is when it's way overpriced, which obviously it isn't. It's actually underpriced.
People that are used to old traditional markets don't understand this and every rally is a bubble.
Bitcoin is not a traditional market. It's global, 24/7 and highly accessible.

Even if I demonstrate how it works, there's no retail taking it right now and almost no one makes online purchases here.
I have advised a close friend and family, which have acted by getting small amounts, just in case we go Greece. But that's about it.
I think what we need right now is Bitpay and Coinbase more actively engaging retail around here.

You're not late.
Wall Street just started moving in and mainstream adoption has started in the last couple of weeks. Thus why we are starting to see what other people think it's crazy rises.
The only reason price doesn't go up more sharply is because of bottleneck user account creation in exchanges.
Can you imagine what is going to happen to the price when Wall Street and its customers gets in? Gold doesn't have a tenth of the utility Bitcoin has and look at its price.

Only for idiots who don't check the price on exchanges which actually have USD.

Who the hell is IGOT? And why don't people use established companies like Bitstamp, Coinbase or Circle?
The first time I planned on buying Bitcoin, I researched the most used and stable exchange.

Being an ETF or not. This is the exact type of move big money would pull if they were trying to get in.
- Step 2. Dump a few thousands to create the start of a dip
- Step 1. Create sell sentiment to lower price with a few articles on all major publications (even if it was just a 20% dip)
- Step 3. Buy the dip
- Step 4. Create buy sentiment (maybe release ETF)
- Step 5. Profit

Not WSJ alone. I think there are a few publications involved and I wonder if this is being orchestrated in the background. Bloomberg and CNBC, who praised Bitcoin just a few weeks ago, are now also trying to make up negative points about Bitcoin
Last week it was China, this week is something else. I'm sure next week they will come up with something else again.

This is nothing. Back in my day, in 2013, it was the first time we heard the phrase "China bans Bitcoin". Man, we were taking it left and right while we hodled together. We hung on for 3 years, but when we finally came out, it was glorious!
We punched through $1000, $2000, $3000 like it was butter, passed through $4000 nearly hitting $5000.
We are just regrouping now, but we'll be back again full force.

Fake news article about China banning Bitcoin (when it's 9pm in China none the less) along with huge dump of thousands of Bitcoins in the chart. Nope, not manipulation at all. 
I'm sure China has banned Bitcoin for the 4000th time and someone is dumb enough to sell thousands of Bitcoins based on a rumor.
Also, regulated currencies suffer from manipulation, yet Bitcoin, which is unregulated, doesn't?

Chargeback and reverse transfer are two completely different things.
Chargeback is for credit cards and only works on certain countries. Reverse transfer doesn't exist.
You should never buy Bitcoin with Credit Card because of chargebacks. Same thing with Paypal.
Whenever selling Bitcoin always demand a bank transfer or cash.

Last China Rally was 2013 when Bitcoin story aired on national TV.
After that, "China bans bitcoin" came up at $1200 and Chinese left Bitcoin. that's when China started to move away. 0% exchange fees and westerners with accounts on chinese exchanges could fake volume easily. So anyone could fake Chinese rallies or dumps as well as arbitrage.

Actually, hold on. 
If the person stealing the private key doesn't know which three digits were changed, that makes it pretty difficult.
But if person knows which three digits were changed, then he just needs to try that private key with all different variations, which would take very little time with a computer. Especially having the public key to confirm result.
Also someone told me here that you can get the public key out of the private key.
EDIT: It appears someone with the technical knowledge showed the calculations above.

How are there 20 million users and only 0.001% are online in this reddit? Same thing on other Bitcoin forums.
I mean, at least 0.1% or 0.01%.
I would argue there's probably 5 million active Bitcoin users, that means they they currently have access to their Bitcoin. And that's overshooting.

Bitcoin is still risky, although the risk is getting lower as time passes by. That's why it's gaining in price. The less risky, the higher price.

I'm one of the posters that encouraged you to go forward. Glad you ended up going for it in the end.
This should show to all the naysayers from previous post that Bitcoin has a lot more utility than people think and it's not just a speculative asset for those pseudo-daytraders that pretend to be finance savy.

What's with all the bcash talk lately?
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:31:46
It can't. 
The 2013 rally was Bitcoin got introduced in China. It got brand new exchanges and documentary story on national TV. Of course there was a rally.
Gox was always $50~$100 over all other exchanges because every one knew Gox was having withdrawings issues and couldn't be trusted.
Then the first "China bans Bitcoin" fake story came up and Bitcoin went crashing. The Gox debacle only happened around $1000~$800 on the way down.
I was here in the first row on 2013 because I just entered Bitcoin. I would consume every news and movement, so I know what I'm talking about.
While the willy bot might be true, at that point no one looked at Gox price as a reference.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:26:21

No, it's not. Most is nitpicking and some not even true.


Bitcoin's fees are the cheapest if you compare with VISA, Paypal, etc.


So I just change to another port?


That's because you are buying with dollars. If you transact solely in Bitcoin, you can remain private. You don't even use exchanges.
You did not address Securely , Permissionless and instantly. You just added some not related comment below it.


No, you just need internet access. Blocking it is pretty hard.


Make it difficult? They can only deem it illegal. Technically there's not much they can do.


Wrong. It's very private if you keep away from dollars.

They were dumb enough to buy high and sell low. They don't want to accept that was dumb so instead they blame technology. Double dumbness.
And then they want to have some sort of revenge and community to validate their dumbness, so they created Buttcoin.
Triple Dumbness. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Slow down there buddy.
Sure, devs do a lot of work, but they are not the one protecting Bitcoin.
Bitcoin protects Bitcoin. It's math protecting it, not devs.
Also, there are devvs on the other side too.
It's when people assign humans to the equation that they fuck up. Bitcoin is the hard work from collective. But its wonder is that is not controlled by anyone or a group in particular.
If core devs fuck it up, you can be sure that people will jump ship very quickly.

The amount of people who used to shit on bitcoin between 2013 and 2014 on reddit was immense. Any post about Bitcoin outside of would get downvoted to hell saying how Bitcoin was a ponzi and such.

Luck is when you make a random decision and it favors you in some way.
If you think you were lucky to have bought Bitcoin, you still don't know what Bitcoin really is, you are unsure about it and you just got in it because you think you can make a few bucks.
The guy wasn't lucky. He saw a technology with a lot of utility value in the field he worked on and got in it. Made perfect sense and like he says, a lot of his friends are now also realizing its potential.
After you get in Bitcoin, Ethereum is so logical because it's Bitcoin on steroids basically. It's riskier because it's an imature technology.
Lucky my ass.

I got my CC blocked when I travelled to Thailand. I called the CC company but didn't have account data with me. It was a nightmare. Thankfully I had a debit card which didn't get blocked. So I wouldn't be suprised if he had to call CC company and prove he's in possession of it. Not to mention the time he's lost proving it.
Yeah, it's not exactly hyping. It's just the current CC system is broken and there's technology that works.

Not all miner hardware has the same potential, so some are making a fortune, but I believe others are only winning because they have free power or close to free, which is the real bad problem here.

@_date: 2017-09-18 21:37:33
I'll give it a shot:


Bitcoin was never meant to replace dollars. Bitcoin is just a decentralized, unbreakable, transfer value protocol that is being used as a store of value and even as payment by thousands of users.


Hundreds of schollars agree that Bitcoin has a beautifully design. So much so that everyone wants to use the Blockchain and know who is the genius who came up with it. You can transfer Bitcoins equivalent to millions of dollars across the world in minutes for a very small fee. Try doing that with dollars. Bad design? You can't fake a Bitcoin, how's that for design over the dollar.




Everyone is holding Bitcoins in Bitcoins, not in dollars. I compare it in Euros so I can see how much the Euro is dropping in relation to Bitcoin.


I tried sending tulips to Japan the other day, they were dead on arrival and took a few days.


You can currently exchange Bitcoins for local currency in 249 countries, if you need to. You can pay mortage with Bitcoin (Bitcoin debit card) and even bread.




If you hold Gold in an exchange-traded fund like raised on previous point, how are you going to take it out without electricity?


Just because the author doesn't know how to explain the volatility, doesn't mean Bitcoin is a failure. It means the author is a failure.
Bitcoin is highly accessible. As such people are flocking to it at incredible rates. That explains why it's shooting up in value. You can buy as easy as you can sell it, so the easy of access allows to sell at any time, anywhere for very small fee. A lot of new investors are playing day trading with it and thus why there's a lot of volatility. As the market grows to higher values we will see more stability.

If it was that easy to change it, Bitcoin would have scaled by now. With compromised devs, users will move to another chain quicker than they got in this one.

@_date: 2017-05-12 15:54:13
No, it cost you $202. The only reason you don't have $1500 is because you didn't buy Bitcoin back.

This is the key statement that a lot of finance people are missing when comparing it with FIAT, Gold, Stock or any other financial assets.
You can even compare with a combination of all of the above and Bitcoin still comes out on top. That's why we are seeing these prices and we're not even close to mainstream adoption.

Is this guy getting paid by banks? Because if not, he's even dumber than I thought.
Also, he's only looking at the financial side of Bitcoin and totally ignoring the technical side. Maybe because he has no idea how it works.

Why do you have to be rude when talking? Did you not receive education about respecting other people? If so, I can understand. 
Localbitcoins allows you to trade btc on the street.


Are you serious? What do you think happens when you sell stock in some exchange? It's stock changing hands between John and Jimmy. Only difference is that there's a need of an exchange to verify you are indeed selling stock and facilitate the transaction.
The advantage of Bitcoin is that you don't need all of that or an intermediary.
But hey keep mocking what you don't know.

@_date: 2017-05-26 09:16:00
And this is why a bubble won't happen anytime soon.
There are so many new people waiting to be verified in coinbase and bitstamp that we'll see the price rise again.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:05:05
Can you see that $1800 rise? It also followed it pretty well, until it didn't.

@_date: 2017-05-24 12:17:32


Here we go... I'm surprised you didn't mention the word Bubble.
You Bubble guys have been saying this since $1500 and guess what, there's a lot of new users and demand for Bitcoin because it's starting to go mainstream. 
Halving has happened and the price should have doubled, it's not even close that point yet.
This has nothing to do with people investing crazy money, this has to do with the cheer number of new users.
@_date: 2017-05-10 11:05:05


Were all other signs of new entrants ignored?
From people asking about wallets, other cryptos, to the rise of volume in all exchanges, to rise in demand. I don't get why people are so amazed at the rise in price.
According to previous rises, this one is actually not even close to the peak.
@_date: 2017-05-08 10:13:23

@_date: 2017-05-08 11:31:52


I think you're wrong but I'm not going to say it here because fanatics go ape shit about it. It's like arguing against Trump in The_D sub.
Bitcoin has had 7+ years to get where it is. We're seeing another crypto achieving more in less time because Bitcoin paved the way, but also because it has additional tech inovations. Some people want to see it, some people don't. The Bitcoin fanatics here are just like when Prof. Bitcorn was saying how Bitcoin would never thrive.
Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin has the user base and miner backup than no other has, but it won't last forever if it doesn't inovate.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:58:33
The alternative is stop listening to idiots that say things like:


@_date: 2015-03-09 19:30:56


You are probably talking about national wire, but what if this transaction is global?
An international wire usually pays $40 for sender plus $40 for receiver. Or you can use Paypal and you have to pay 3% for transaction plus 3% for currency conversion.
So Bitcoin is a huge help in this situation

Beware of private messages. Follow advice from people who talk openly in public and not in private messages.
Having said that, go through one of European exchanges, Bitstamp or Kraken. Or go through Coinbase.
If you want to do small quantities and without jumping through identification hoops, then do it through Localbitcoins and do it in a public location.
Only buy what you can afford to lose.

Most people here don't know what a financial bubble means. A bubble is supposed to happen once, not multiple times at higher and higher prices. The intrinsic value of Bitcoin hasn't changed much since 2013, but people just like to scream bubble to pretend they understand financial words. They were already screaming bubble at $1600 and look where we are now.

I don't think most people here realize what's happening.
Media is reporting Bitcoin on front pages without the "bad actors currency" attached. Like in 2013 but without "China bans Bitcoin" and Mtgox crash.
People screaming bubble are people who sold thinking a crash would come soon and are being left behind pretty quickly.
I'm guessing these people start buying back again soon because they are missing the train.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:41:02

No it doesn't. Previous bubbles were 6 to 10x, this has just touched 2x, so it's not even close.
Plus, if this is mainstream adoption, it won't be 10x, it will be above that.
Mainstream adoption means that instead of 0.01% of people buying bitcoin, you will have 10% of people buying bitcoin. Can you imagine what that would do to the price?

@_date: 2017-05-25 10:05:53


Well, think about it. There's 16M in circulation. Let's say people want it just for store of value for now, like gold, but better because it's portable, can't be counterfeited, you can liquidate at any time, you can transfer it anywhere in the world. So I would say accurately it should **at least** be worth 30% of Gold and this is way underestimation.
So Gold is 7 trillion right now.
30% of 7 trillion Gold = 2 trillion / 16M bitcoin = $130 000
This is all underestimating a lot.
I would call it a bubble when it's getting higher than that in less than 3 years.
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:44:29

Everyone needs to calm down. Bitcoin was bitching about FIAT, then bitching about Alts, then bitching about BU and now bitching about Alts again.
Bitcoin fanatics are strongly hypocritical and forget where they came from.  It's always us vs them which is also stupid since most of the tech and principals are shared between sides.
The tone of arrogance can be felt especially on some leaders of the community which is just sad because the tech is independent of those self-thought "leaders". And I'm talking about both sides.

Oh, no doubt some alts are getting pumped without something to back it up.

Sorry, you are right and I didn't mean to get personal. But don't say it's not a conflict of interests. It can be since they are working on interfacing technologies.
Also, I just saw an article how Blockstream is patenting their tech because of patent trolling. This justification seems a bit bullshit as Bitcoin has been public domain and haven't had any problems so far.
As someone that has been neutral to this whole discussion, it's starting to look very fishy because the plan with segwit was to interface with LN. So doesn't this mean that Bitcoin would be interfacing with a patented technology?

Those calculators are usually a bit optimistic and you are now looking at a time when cryptos are gaining value. In a few days, those 140 days will become 300 as everyone moves their rigs to that particular crypto.
As someone who has gone that path a few years ago, Financially speaking, it's not worth the time and money you spend building, troubleshooting and maintaining (looking for which crypto is currently worth mining) it.
If you want to learn the whole process and have time to spare, then go ahead. I did it because of thinking it was financially viable and ended up liking it because it was interisting and learned a lot about crypto in general.

Really? If you have no knowledge of physics and someone tells you people travelled to the moon, you will probably say it was staged.
On the other hand, you can bet that never a phd in physics has said that the moon landing was staged.

I think it was around $600~$900, can't quite remember. However, by then, Bitcoin was very much under the radar and underestimated because it was still below the ATH.
As an old bitcoin investor, most of the time, I can't really relate btc price with just one factor, there's always about 10 factors for the price. 
However, these last weeks you can clearly see hundreds of new people coming in. Reputable exchanges are going down because of overwhelming traffic, exchange support has been overwhelmed addressing new users, so there's plenty of proof.
Bitcoin trends is also your friend and that has sky-rocketed.
I'm not surprised at all with the rise of price and it's not because people are putting in insane amounts of money, it's because there's insane amount of new people.
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:10:29

Probably because of a lot of new users go to Bitstamp and not Bitfinex. Also, that's why Coinbase also has higher prices.

People should start looking at percentages instead of $100s at this point
Also, there's plenty of reports people who are waiting for a week to be verified at exchanges like Bitstamp and Kraken.
Which means, new users who have registered in the last 4~5 days haven't even had a chance to buy yet, keep that in mind.

I may have a short memory, but I don't remember any big debate about block size by then.
And why didn't he just partially sell them instead of the whole chunk?
It seems more like he was trying to tank the price to buy lower to be honest, except it backfired because the community didn't think the price should go any lower.
Thank you for the cheap bitcoins though.

Another one of those "This is a bubble" posts...
It won't stop raising soon.
Remember when Bitcoin went from $1 to $10? What about when it went from $10 to $100? What about when it went from $200 to $1300?
Can you see a trend here? It's ~10x rises. You think Bitcoin is just going from $1300 ATH to $2100? Of course not. Next stop is way higher than this.
I like that it often goes down $100 and every panicky hand starts selling. You know, for those guys that scream bubble whenever someone farts.

Marketcap will be much higher than that, much quicker than people think.
Marketcap is not a correct representation of all money invested in Bitcoin. 
If you sell $50M of Bitcoin you can easily throw Bitcoin price down by a few hundreds, yet the market cap would go down a few billion.
The same happens the other way around and people will be buying more and more in the near future, so expect it to surpass the $1T sooner than people think.

Not only that, they are using that word as politicians do. And I hate how politicians use that word to strike fear into people.
Almost like priests used the words hell and sin for things they don't want people doing.
Is this what core devs are trying to achieve? Strike fear into Bitcoin users by using that word?
If so, that's dubious tactics.

There are assholes everywhere, on the street and even in Bitcoin. That does not mean that all people from alt coins are all assholes, so stop implying that.
This does not go far from the post where people here were calling BU terrorists.
It's starting to become propaganda, so stop it.

The beauty of bitcoin blockchain tech is its public accessability and decentralization. Making it centralized is just an encrypted storage medium. There's better technologies for that.
Besides, making it centralized makes it vulnerable to a central point of attack, but a lot of companies are having a big woooosh over their heads.

You guys love to scream bubble and speculation.
Bitcoin goes to $1600? Bubble! Speculation!
Eth goes to $100? Bubble! Speculation!
Bitcoin goes to $2500? Bubble! Speculation!
Eth goes to $200? Bubble! Speculation!
Except, guess what? Look at the prices now. We're there and it's neither a bubble or speculation. These are real assets with real financial applications that are being used in real scenarios and everyone wants a part of it before it's unattainable.
If bitcoin is so low value then what the fuck are you doing here? wasting time?

You would not be smart if you think it doesn't have utility.
Of course it does. You can prove you own a specified quantity of it over a finite amount. No one can forge it either. You can send that ownership or part of it across the world in a matter of minutes and no one can interfere.
You can also prove you have a specific document in a point of time and no one can erase it.
Also, it has monetary value and you can trade it for pretty much any currency in the world.

Wait a few days and it will be back on top. Grab popcorn and watch this drop caused by "traders" trying to guess the market and trying to raise chaos for profit on each other. 
It's quite entertaining actually. They then come in here and create panic threads on how bitcoin has serious issues or it's a bubble and all that bullshit.

Yep. Asia markets have been above Western ones because of demand.
Western markets are being shorted and played by traders, thus why you see some bogus stories along with fake reports like the one about the congress having new measures for cryptos.

Tom Keene even said the wikipedia article on Bitcoin is Superb! He has come around and he's proof that anyone opposing Bitcoin will eventually understand it and come around. It's just logic and common sense the amount of benefits bitcoin can bring.
Having said that, I'm happy to see he went through the trouble of reading the wikipedia article. I would bet he will buy some Bitcoins in the near future.

Yeah but if there's another big crash and comes down more than currently, he will be sorry he has bought at a higher price. So, statistically, his point makes sense to buy in chunks instead of all at once.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:23:10
This! I'm an amateur in exchanges and trading. But by "cash out" he means to sell your bitcoins. This means, someone deposited dollars in the said exchange to buy those bitcoins. I don't get the liquidity problem. You can only "cash out" or sell your bitcoins if there's someone to buy them using the dollars you will be "cashing out".

@_date: 2013-12-23 14:53:18
You say that because you bought before China involvement. But if you bought after China involvement, that is not the case.
I understand your argument and it partially makes sense. It all depends on how the market evolves. However, let me explain what happened to me and you will understand it can go both ways. 
I've initially bought a small amount of BTC at $350, then as soon as I got more money to invest, I bought more BTC as soon as I got it in my account, at $800 and $1000. If I had waited, I could have bought it at $380 when it crashed. This was not the first time it happened either.
So you see, not staking it all at once and keeping some aside for when it goes low, is always a good idea. Mostly because you will feel worse when you buy high and it crashes, than when you don't buy and it keeps going higher.
