I did.  That's for the lowest option.  At priority it was 0.0107.  How do I set my own fee on iOS?

Care to specify how I can change the default amounts in Mycelium? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:46:40
Can you refer one that's on both Android and iOS? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:58:45
Hope so! Glad to help out my fellow redditors
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:29:06
where's the slider you mention?
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:01:49
S’okay, I’ve been downvotes by better.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:37:52
Yep. That's Mycelium on iOS.

Just got on my Android wallet, upgraded, and was able to select 70 sat. Five confirmations in ten minutes. Shame this isn’t available on the iOS version.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:39:33
Clearly. :(
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:58:04
The real thing, baby!
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:34:05
Yep. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:24:06
I said Bitcoin.

Mycelium is charging $26 at their lowest priority.  I guess I need to find a new online wallet as well.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:26:23
Currently don't have access to my Android device, but it does give me better fees generally.  Not great fees though.

@_date: 2017-11-20 06:35:25
That's "Send" on iOS.  
The Settings option has Exchange Rates, Invite a fried, Back up the wallet, About Mycelium Wallet, Credits, Legal and Export Diagnostical Data.  Which should I look for a slider
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:32:30
Is there something besides Low Priority, Economy, Normal, and Priority?  Right now Low Priority is 0.0032
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:24:13
Still being charged 0.0032.  You must be luckier than I.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:57:30
Not the beginning, but thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:45:18
Yeah, that's not a choice in iOS.  Just "Low Priority", "Economical", "Normal", and "Priority."  No range to choose from.  Thanks though.

I wouldn't have a problem with that long.  It's to a paper wallet (I print off to paper wallets at 0.1 increments so if I pass, my family will find and be able to use.)
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:27:00
How do I do this on iOS?
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:31:05
Care to show me where the slider is?
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:24:38
Is that available on both iOS and Android?
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:59:05
Neither on iOS. Sorry.
