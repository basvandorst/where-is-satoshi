My first official bitcoin purchase! I was hesitant to use my BTC, but I support everything you've been doing to spread the word on Bitcoin, and appreciate all the efforts you put towards this. Looking forward to reading the book!

Security. This machine accepts and dispenses cash. You want something big and heavy, to make it harder for someone to take. Has to be reinforced to reduce the ability to break into it, also need to have heavy duty locks as well. 
Can definitely be reduced in size! but you gotta keep those things in mind when dealing with equipment that stores and handles cash.

Hey Guys,
I've helped volunteer for these guys in the past, and have convinced them to accept BTC donations. Took a little convincing, but they finally caved to give it a shot. 
The guy who started it is a colleague of mine, and his drive to help these people in need is quite inspirational. I'd love to show him how awesome the Bitcoin community is by sharing this out, and hoping you're in support of his vision!
Here's a direct link to the donation page:

That list will continue to grow as Bitcoin matures as well. People will continue to get creative with it, and create new ways it can be used.

I think it's a perfect term to help describe Bitcoin! it was a light bulb moment for me when that came to mind, it just, makes sense. 
I'm hoping the video helps people understand that as well, might take a little more explaining and expanding on it, but I think it's a good start.

As mentioned in the description of the video, I don't have much for video editing skills! So I kept it simple, and hope that it makes sense to everyone.

Well shit, that was awesome. Thanks, much appreciated!

You know, I was going to come back with a smart ass comment to this, but decided against it since it wouldn't be very productive. I went through some of your history, and I have a couple honest comments.
Best of luck with quitting the smoking habit (if you're still attempting), that shit is hard to go through. Have known a few people that have gone through the challenge, and it can take a beating on you. The folks that were successful, said it's the best decision they've ever made. My Dad also quit, now he can't even stand the idea of cigarettes. But if you can make it through the tough parts, and I'm sure you can, it'll be golden from there.
Also, if you want someone to chat with, and shoot the shit on random topics or maybe looking for some strangers advice without feeling judged. Send me a PM, random conversation with strangers are always interesting and can provide some perspective and be an unusual source of motivation.

yeah, totally sucks, and thanks for the tip!  mmm...ice cream.

Not sure of the specific exploit, or how they do it, but it's not the first time it happened. as mentioned, there this guy:
and this guy:
I wish I knew how they took advantage of it. I use fairly complicated passwords, so even if it was a brute force, it would have taken a LONG time to crack it.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:16:36
I suppose it doesn't hurt to give it a try! I'll give it a shot and see what they come back with.

pretty useful explorer!
I was wondering if I should get authorities involved, but I don't think I'd have enough evidence on my side to prove that it was TeamViewer hack and not myself sending the BTC . Since uninstalling it, all logs have been removed (at least, I don't see any on my PC right now). So I don't have anything to back up the claim. (unless anyone else has any ideas?)
If I managed to put two and two together when I first noticed the TeamViewer issue, I would have been able to save some of the log files to show that the BTC transaction lines up with when the connection came through on TV.

Thanks man, appreciate it!

I used TeamViewer, so I could have remote access capabilities to my PC when I needed it and help others with PC problems if they requested it. I've only ever been the one to connect to my PC, and have never given access to others. Been looking at purchasing a new firewall these days, so it may be time to get a Cisco ASA or Palo Alto device and use the remote VPN capabilities on those boxes!
Considering they rave about their [security]( on the site, you'd think it'd be a safe tool. But just as said above in another comment, I'm starting to think it's backdoored as well. It's sold as an enterprise level tool, and I have clients that use it in that fashion, so it seems a little off that it's having these security issues.
I didn't have 2FA configured, so that's definitely my error. But I still have no idea how they'd get access. Had a complex password that would have taken ages to brute force.

I'm new to the crypto currency world, but could we use this with other coins as well? Litecoin maybe?
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:01:41
While there are definitely cases of that...the most commonly traded currency in that world is actually USD.

Really hoping this is in Calgary!
