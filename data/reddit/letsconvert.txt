Right now bitcoin is relatively cheaper. Its a good idea to buy btc right now.
However, over long term, always diversify.

Btc market capitalization was 55% just forty days ago. Today its 37%. so there is variation happening all the time.

You can also use a public xpub key to watch all your addresses, fyi.

You can move any amount of money for $5 or less.
Thats cheap.

Story is simple. Ive had six coins since nov 16. Their value has jumped almost 25 times now. I knew I'd get rich through bitcoins when I bought them, but didn't guess it would be in one year. 
I've been in crypto for three years. So I knew it would go high. 
I'm not that rich compared to others. But I'm the richest I've ever been.

Here in India, I went to sleep with bitcoin at 11.8K. Woke up at $12.4K. 
Good start to the day. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:24:32
Siacoin was in this space. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:16:57
Because there is more demand in korea. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:04:57
Oh yeah. Thanks. I got it.

Whats decuples?

Bitcoin fees are $10 or thereabouts. Bitcoin is useless for incidental expenses.
Only reason to own bitcoin is for its rising cred as store of value,and future possibilities of lightning network. Satoshi's point is right in theory for his world, but things are changing. There is no proof he ever thought of lightning network, for example.

I hear bitcoin gold is also minable using gpu. They use a special algo.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:17:24
At 2.5K, I was telling all my friends, in our whatsapp group, how to buy bitcoin. I told them the whole process of buying it and storing it in your own wallet. 
I wonder if anyone bought it. 
I am invested since $500.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:45
Admit it, you just like fisting yourself. Cause thats what it means.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:44:47
Got it. I had such a plan to sell. "everytime it triples", I'd sell 10%.
That was the plan in november 2016. I expected bitcoin to triple every year. So I'd only have to sell it once a year.
But as they say, the best laid plans...

I'm glad to have a contrary opinion from the likes of Jamie. Otherwise, it just becomes a total circlejerk.

Been there. Done that. Was already hacked once. Lost one coin in 2015.
Now I take lot more care. But yes, fear is always there. What if. Gotta get over it.

You only open a channel with a hub or service provider.
Gas station will also have a channel with a service provider. 
You pay him. The transaction will be routed between different hubs till it reaches him. 
 you don't have to open channel with him. Except in special cases when there is no route from your hub to his.

Thats also the average fee right now. Funny.

It would have been great. But then whats the best thing to do with you 16k? Invest in bitcoin. 
Then why sell? Just keep holding for greater profits over longer term.

Someone ping me when this post is proven to be a joke so I can laugh without guilt.

Don't mislead people. Bitcoin can't jump 1000x from todays prices.
Governments will ban or control on/off ramps way before that, which will limit its price.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:12:24
You need other subs. Bitcoinmarkets, cryptocurrency, electrum, ledgerwallet are some bitcoin related subs. I even go to buttcoin sometimes.

just as hashrate increases/adjusts in bitcoin, its throughput (transactions processed per day) should also adjust. Thats what a better currency will have.

I feel like a retard because I don't understand how the profit is being made. I follow that you are buying bitcoin for 16.7k. But then what? Are you selling it in feb for 17550? Is that whats happening?

We have gold loans in India. Basically, you keep gold as collateral, ang get a cash loan. Same way, btc can be kept as collateral to get cash loans.

But what happens if bitcoin goes to 15k ?
He loses 1700 on the btc he owns. And also has to sell that shorted btc at a high price, doesn't he?

Damn dude, bitcoin is not gonna replace dollar. 
Not for the next decade at least. This rally is built on such speculations, it seems.
Though I did invest all I had in btc. In 2016. So I'm not complaining.

Another 15% and it will hit a million INR in India.

I can't take it seriously because they don't have segwit, and therefore no possibility of lightning network.
