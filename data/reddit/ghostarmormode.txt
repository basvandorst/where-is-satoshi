Bitcoin Core is the real Bitcoin Cash

Reptilian Soros dosen't wear a monocle wtf?

Your right I'm not using the right term. What I mean is trusted 3rd party. Basically what has already been discussed in this thread about not holding private keys.
@_date: 2018-08-26 07:05:34
Damn that's a lot of hashes.

Historically this meme appearing has been the best time to buy.

Bitcoin is "first-gen" yet it has the latest code base optimizations not to mention the latest technologies like SegWit and soon Schnorr.
It's like calling Iron Man "first-gen" compared to copy cat armors in Iron Man 2.

It's like Bitcoin is going through a fever to kill off the parasite alts.

Sure, but that dosen't equate to a central point of failure. No central points of failure is what we mean by decentralized.

If there was an alt extinction event just watch this little snake back pedal to Bitcoin in his rhetoric.

Kek. Let em burn.

Yep, much more cash-like (their definition of "cash") then Bcash is and probably ever will be. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 10:20:23
Why are you even asking this question, it was already answered last year with the 2X backroom deal and the Bcash rage quit.
Full node operators, IRL user communities, coin signing whales and developers won. Miners chickened out of 2X (which would have froze the block chain anyway). Then hash power tried to switch to Bcash but then switched back after Bitcoin stayed strong and then rallied to near $20k with Segwit.
Bcash is continually losing it's value til this day.

It's probably just an exit scam.

Now, you must remember: the enemy has only images and illusions behind which he hides his true motives. Destroy the image and you will break the enemy.

The bear market is painful, but watching BCH slide below 0.08 is worth it. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:09:56
isn't surprised by this, been saying this shit forever, all the other crypto subs are
@_date: 2018-08-17 06:28:43
Any amount?
Well that's simple. Let's start with the extreme that the ETF gets all or almost all bitcoins. What the point of a decentralized currency if the supply is controlled by a single government connected entity?
Also you know the argument how if Satoshi wanted to he could crash the entire market if he sells his million coins or whatever it is. Or for example when Mt Gox crashed the market with only a single digit percentage of coins.
Have all these bitcoins pool into a single point of failure in the form of and ETF puts us at risk and makes other more "fairly" distributed cryptos that can't be dumped on by an institution at any moment more attractive.

Not satisfied until it falls to 0 but I've grateful for what we've got so far.
@_date: 2018-08-17 04:55:36
Satoshi is whoever you want him to be.
@_date: 2018-08-17 05:00:24
Large percentage of all coins held up in an ETF would produce a large and systemic counter party risk into Bitcoin, destroying it's fundamental value proposition. Maybe that's the plan.
