ok, thanks anyway!
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:38:49
ok i'll bite... paid. waiting!

SSD! ok thanks. Next tricky step is directing QT to spend a coin from a specific address

got a customer support email back from Mandrik, there's nothing they can do, the app is permanently fee-less (because Apple won't let them push new updates) So it's all about waiting for the HTML5 apps to come out

I'm using that app. 0 fee. Not sure why. It's an older iphone, I downloaded the app in the window it was still available. Possibly before a nonzero fee update was implemented. But I was too afraid if I updated the app I'd lose Tx altogether...

Hmmm, upon importing the private key into a fresh wallet in Mutlibit, the program immediately added my STUCK Tx to the Transactions pane, even before re-scanning the blockchain for the imported address. The stuck Tx must be nice and fresh in the SPV servers... So it's my same problem - I need a wallet that will proudly IGNORE an unconfirmed Tx so I can double spend!

OK thanks, cool.

OK I'd like to try this, but my original, 'limbo' TX counts as a spent output on blockchain.info. Meaning if I moved the key to a new wallet (at least on blockchain.info) it would (I assume) NOT sweep the output that is currently stuck. So not only do I need to move the key to a new wallet, but also I need to tell that wallet to IGNORE the stuck Tx so I can reuse that output. Do you know a wallet that can do this? My unspent outputs:

That is, if your Tx has a fee. I'm in limbo with a Tx sent from the blockchain.info app, which did not include a miners fee. In a few days if it is not confirmed, my Tx will be dropped from the memory pool. In this case, if I had walked out of a store with physical merchandise, the merchant would just have been ripped off

I would really like to try double spending, but I would need a new wallet which can ignore the stuck Tx, so I can respend that output. Blockchain.info does not consider the stuck output as unspent, and so (I THINK) sweeping that key into a new wallet on blockchain.info would not help, because it would not sweep the stuck output. 
Blockchain.info lists my unspent outputs, and shows the CHANGE from the stuck TX, but I don't think I can double spend the original stuck output...

OK I will try this, out of curiosity. But this is asking for the infamous QT rescan, aka 3 day wait, right? By that time some miner might actually throw me a bone and include me in a block. Good to know --rescan dumps the memory pool though. And then I guess I have to hope I can spend that coin before some other node sends me back the stuck Tx again
