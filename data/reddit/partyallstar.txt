A few months ago, there was a redditor who had applied for a job as an engineer at Mt. Gox.  He said he declined the job after he was offered it because of impressions he got about their work environment during the course of the interview.  Once he posted, more details came to light.  This was in the thread about the protest:
Edit: link - 
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:27:48
That's overly kind; and thank you, because that's what I was aiming at.  I went into more depth about it the whys and whens yesterday, but not many saw that post.  [Link](  


I was working in LA last week, and convinced some Youtubers ([Bree Essrig]( and [Brooke Marks]( to make a video about Bitcoin. I have a feeling this video would eventually be x-posted here, and if you guys think it's STUPID (spoiler alert: it is) or annoying, I want to be the one that takes the comment criticism instead of the girls, because it's my fault.
Once they said yes to the idea, I found out pretty quickly that it's not easy to explain Bitcoin concepts without getting bogged down and technical, and it's especially hard to try and make the information “funny”. I did my best to boil down the concepts into little blurbs. I believe eventually someone else will do this kind of Bitcoin video much better.  
There ARE already some excellent videos explaining “What is Bitcoin”, including several animated videos, and almost anything where [andreasma]( is talking (My favorite is his [Jefferson Club Dinner video]( This video includes nods to the r/bitcoin content I've enjoyed very much, ([like this awesome time-lapse animation]( depicting the version control/collaborations on the protocol, and the articles on Bitcoin mining operations like [this one by thecoinsman.](  
The morning we shot this, I had a two-hour conversation about Bitcoin with Brooke and her boyfriend Brett Erlich (he's a TV show host, a Stanford grad, and a very bright and nice guy.) We wrote some jokes on the fly, Bree came over, and then we started filming. I can't help but feel it could have been done better, but it was just one thing Brooke and I shot in a long work day.  
I know the end result is a little dopey and easy, but when it comes to Youtube community, there are a good population of people there who respond to that tone, and even more who stare at boobs. So, at best, I'm hoping this can leverage the fans of the vlogger and boobs genres and do some good at spreading the word.
TLDR: What is Bitcoin? Again. Cleavage.

I would guess they did this because there is no recurring subscription, and so having a pre-cancelled trial of 30 days is A) Less than what the average member would spend net, and they want that money B) a convenience.

I am plagued by pirates who resell our downloads for cheaper on file lockers.  I'm certainly interested in "solving" that problem.  As long as the performers and crew and myself can make a living, I don't care in what order the sales are made.  I'd be willing to try it.

Hi guys, long-time here.  I want to start off by saying I don't want anything, and I don't mean to spam.  
I was working in LA last week, and convinced some Youtubers ([Bree Essrig]( and [Brooke Marks]( to make a video about Bitcoin.  I have a feeling this video would eventually be x-posted here, and if you guys think it's STUPID (spoiler alert: it is) or annoying, I want to be the one that takes the comment criticism instead of the girls, because it's my fault.  
Once they said yes to the idea, I found out pretty quickly that it's not easy to explain Bitcoin concepts without getting bogged down and technical, and it's especially hard to try and make the information “funny”.  I did my best to boil down the concepts into little blurbs.  I believe eventually someone else will do this kind of Bitcoin video much better.  
There ARE already some excellent videos explaining “What is Bitcoin”, including several animated videos, and almost anything where [andreasma]( is talking (My favorite is his [Jefferson Club Dinner]( video).   This video includes nods to the r/bitcoin content I've enjoyed very much, (like [this awesome time-lapse animation]( depicting the version control/collaborations on the protocol, and the articles on Bitcoin mining operations like [this one by thecoinsman](   
The morning we shot this, I had a two-hour conversation about Bitcoin with Brooke and her boyfriend Brett Erlich (he's a TV show host, a Stanford grad, and a very bright and nice guy.)  We wrote some jokes on the fly, Bree came over, and then we started filming.  I can't help but feel it could have been done better, but it was just one thing Brooke and I shot in a long work day.  
I know the end result is a little dopey and easy, but when it comes to Youtube community, there are a good population of people there who respond to that tone, and even more who stare at boobs.  So, at best, I'm hoping this can leverage the fans of the vlogger and boobs genres and do some good at spreading the word.  
TLDR: What is Bitcoin? Again. Cleavage.

That's fine, support what charities you like.  But why the instinct to "get it funded with bitcoin!" especially at fragile time like this?  The far right WOULD stretch the truth and call a charity like this "supporting terrorism", just like you say.  That's why things like this - and everyone thumbing their nose at power with fucking Wikileaks donations being mostly bitcoin - are a bad instinct at a time when govt. regulators all over the world are looking at how money is being "laundered" through crypto.  Unless you really have no other way of supporting your anti-establishment causes and don't care if Bitcoin eventually has no fiat exchange value, then parading Bitcoin funding for controversial topics will hurt it.  Sure, The Man can't "kill bitcoin" as a decentralized network and protocol, but he sure can make the ecosystem less useful.

I didn't want to say anything because it sounded like whining and who cares, but I saw this happen to one of my threads.  I photoshopped and posted the stupid picture of Karpeles meeting the giant frappuchino protestor outside Gox.  By the comments, it made people chuckle, and it hit the "front page" with a ratio around 85% up 15% down.  An hour later, it was 1:1 up/down, and the comments had done a 180.  The top comments had been suddenly down voted so hard they were hidden.  There were new top comments about anti-bullying.  This was a totally unimportant post, but it was evidence in my mind of a bot passing through, or at least some kind of coordination.

Saffron - this video is a good pitch only to individuals hand processing transactions for things like single clips or panties or escorting.  I get where you're coming from.
But the adult industry doesn't use Paypal.  To set up a website to process subscriptions, there are a host of issues that Bitcoin, or even Paypal, wouldn't address in simple fashion.  You need affiliate tracking software and password management/turnkey.  Most webmasters either cobble together these things between their own merchant account and software like NATS for affiliates, or get an all-in-one solution from a company like CCbill or Epoch.  
And if you already have a website, and want to let people transact with Bitcoin and gain access in an automated way, there is no company yet (not Bitpay, Coinbase or Circle) that will integrate their own tools and API into your site.  I contacted the first two about processing transactions for our network, and they recommended a list of freelance programmers I could hire to do the jobs.  So they aren't quite there yet, as far as accommodating the adult industry as clients, but this space is new, and I think they'll get there one day.
Tldr: this video addresses someone who would misguidedly use PayPal for adult, and not the industry.  Using PayPal is neither practical or allowed anyway.

I suspect your philosophy is convenient to justifty taking what you want for free, but lets see if it applies to apples and oranges.  When Russians buy lists of stolen American credit card numbers and then put them in my websites, steal the latest updates literally minutes after they come out, upload them to their own website and sell the files for half price in Bitcoin, and spam the links to get high search engine rankings for people trying to find it, are the right people getting paid?  Do you think using large scale credit card fraud to undercut my price because their production cost of duplication is zero is a fair competitor in the market place?  This is the issue I deal with every day.  My price is based on production costs; the Russian price has no controls (other than what they paid to harvest the credit cards.)

Those big companies are the worst for exactly that experience you described.  They have their own merchant accounts, their own shady up sells, and they pay their affiliates PPS instead of revshare.  So sometimes you see $100 sales paid out to an affiliate that they then have to out-do with what they get from the user.  They make it hard to cancel, hard to know what you've signed up for, all kinds of stuff.
The sites that use CCBill, like ours, don't get up to shanannigans like that.  We do straight rev-share 50-50, and I never do anything with the emails we have access to.  I don't collect them at all.  Some people would say I'm missing an opportunity there, but I'm not under pressure to squeeze every last dime out of our members.

Transactions for adult content are classified as "high risk" by VISA, etc, and so have to be coded that way and assessed higher fees.  With third party billing processors like CCBill, these processing fees are as high as 18% right off the top.  Not only that, but VISA and MasterCard want $500 each a year just for the right to do it.  Small time operations try and use PayPal to get around these fees, and when Paypal catches it, they can the account.  
She was probably using Paypal to sell custom content, or extra videos.  Cam girls do this all the time.  It's actually a common way to get back at a cam girl that "pisses you off" - rat her out to Paypal and get her balance frozen.
