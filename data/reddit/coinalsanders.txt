Source is Bloomsberg? Totes legit.

Not sure if I agree on the selling Litecoin just yet, but I think there is a good chance for $40k Bitcoin within three months.

That is a seriously random spot to come across one of these 
@_date: 2019-03-16 02:41:43
This news hit me like a punch to the listicles!

IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:40:00
That's not the point at all...but thanks for your input.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:52:42
Did you enter the charge amounts that you see on your checking account...? It's not that hard. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:21:10
Yes, exactly the point of my post. They think because there are no repercussions that business ethics don't exist. They should still have some respect instead of taking advantage. 
@_date: 2019-12-24 21:57:09
Well, you sir are an idiot that lacks logic or any real knowledge to back up your thoughts. You have zero clue what you’re spewing about. Big facts.
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:18:25
In US dollar.
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:18:05
Looking for price. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:14:29
Thank you. Are you sure?
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:26:17
Not sure what you mean...? Just looking for the end of 2020 price as a bit of investment advice.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:59:28
Thanks, but just want to keep the thread on topic. Looking for exact price, not some sort of math equation. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:06:15
Not sure what you mean by vision. Just looking for the price so I know how much I should buy and how much I'll make on my investment. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:35:25
Some may be, so that's why I specifically asked for no guesses. I'm looking for the exact price. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:41:25
Thanks for your comments. But I want to make sure I keep this thread on topic: Exact price of BTC at end of 2020. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:02:37
I appreciate you supplying a range, but this thread is getting muddied up a bit. Looking for responses from those that know what the exact price will be at end of 2020. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:07:32
Thanks. But looking to know now since I'll be buying in the next couple days if the price at end of 2020 is appealing.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:58:06
Thanks. Are you/Tim positive though? Sounds a bit like you're not sure...
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:27:13
Thanks! I'm getting a lot of responders who aren't certain, so this helps a lot. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:03:30
With that said, where will that put the price at end of 2020?
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:03:03
Looking for price in US dollar. Thanks. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:17:41
I just don't want guesses. Maybe I came off a bit brash, but just looking for the end of 2020 price. 
@_date: 2019-09-06 02:37:32
Something is happening...I feel it
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:37:25
This may be the best Bitcoin meme ever made
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:57:16
Only the 100th time I’ve heard that horseshit in the last two years...
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:50:14
One of the nicest inevitablys I've ever seen. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 06:01:48
Dur?
