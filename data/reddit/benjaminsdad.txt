Neo isn't a 'bank' in that sense. They CAN NOT touch your money. Multi-sig private keys with you, neo, and a 3rd party legal entity ensure this.
Most transactions will be you/neo's sig.
If neo goes busto, you/3rd party to retrieve your coins.
If you go busto (lol) neo/3rd party will give your coins to your heirs.

@_date: 2014-02-25 00:12:14
Hey bud, my suggestion: Buy some coins, lets say you bought 100 as an example. Put 50% away in a cold storage wallet for speculation, put 10% into Neo&amp;Bee shares on  - sell 20% of your coins on BTC-E and have some tiered buys all the way down to roughly $200 dollars to rebuy back in case there's a panic sell, (you'll thank me for this later) The other 20% you should do whatever you feel like, make a purchase with a gyft card, try a few hands of poker at  ... try to stay away from any scams and most of all YOU ARE -=NOT=- late. :) Congrats!

They have created an amazing bitcoin business, in probably the best location for it. Smart businesses will be rewarded.
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:40:49
You have to look on a longer timeline. 
Bitcoin will always be deflationary because the coins are released in equal or lesser amounts and at a steady rate. At first, there were 50 coins, then it grew to 50+50 = 100% inflation in 10 minutes. Then it was 100+50 which was 50% inflation in 10 minutes. 
The dollar for example, isn't regulated in this way, and assuming there's 1 quadrillion dollars, there's no stopping someone from printing 1 or 2 or 30 quadrillion dollars instantly.
Make sense?

They're just ripoff coins of bitcoin. I'm not interested in trading pump and dump ripoffs. That's your prerogative.
I'm talking about trading a real company just like you would on the New York Stock Exchange, except it's denominated entirely in bitcoin.
I will say this, the concept of trading bitcoin vs NEOBEE shares and bitcoin vs dogecoin is precisely the same.
Good luck to you on your endeavours. Try not to lose your shirt investing in something risky like an altcoin.

Well, if something big happens, and all the banks go bust, all unsecured creditors funds will be used to reduce bank liabilities and that means that anyone's savings in the bank will be washed away.
FDIC can step in.
As I stated earlier, they simply don't have enough funds if this contagion spreads. 
This represents a lack of solvency in an extreme scenario.
Therefor, to reiterate my original statement; FDIC isn't as solvent as you think they are.

In the end, this will be extremely good news to people who hold bitcoins safely with themselves. When this house of cards comes crashing down in 5 years and people all think they have bitcoins equal to 100 million in circulation when there's really only 20 million and the value is ALREADY high. Just super bullish.

Cyprus was the reason I heard about bitcoin in the first place. I owe my gratitude to Zerohedge for bringing it to my attention &amp; making fun of it while I researched and made my own decisions. I'm hoping they continue to get a lot of exposure and advance through Europe next year and onward.

Yeah, I can't even imagine the need for using something so long to be honest. If you use something small like mine, which looks 'easily crackable' to some perhaps, the odds that someone would actually come up with that are extremely low. Hell, I couldn't come up with it for a long time and I wrote the damn thing. 
EDIT: In order to help you, I'll let you know that I gave up several times and every so often I attempted to input my passphrase with whatever I felt at the time and one day it popped open, and I said oh... yeah...

Sorry, perhaps it's just simply so obvious that I assumed you felt the same way about the way of the dollar and other fiat currencies. You should do your own research on the subject and make a decision from there. Bitcoin will be there if &amp; when you feel the need to adopt it.

@_date: 2014-02-27 00:53:42
So Neo &amp; Bee are two separate entities that operate under a single parent company. They work together to help people buy and spend save and accept bitcoins easily.
Someone would go into Neo and setup an account with them, purchase bitcoins, they will then be linked to a debit card that can be used on the Bee payment network. The debit card has an easy 8 digit number instead of a long hash such as: 188iWmK9GJ12w48ET2kVcAwSQtuainMArH (yea my address)
So the user will convert Euro's (currently Cyprus only atm, plans for global expansion in the future (see prospectus)) to Bitcoins at Neo or a Bee terminal, and then be able to spend them at any merchant that accepts them.
You also have 2 options, keeping your account pegged to the euro, or choosing to be fully exposed to the ups and downs of the bitcoin market.
You can purchase shares on Havelock Investments, I'm not going to link it for you because you'll just google it.
One quick 3 minute youtube video for you, it does a fantastic job of explaining everything I just did, but even better actually. :)

Cryptobanks? Like Neo &amp; Bee? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:45:52
First of all, if the dollar doesn't exist in a few years as it does today, and bitcoin does become mainstream as you allude to in your questioning then you would have exchanged your man hours for bitcoin already, completely bypassing any fiat-&gt;bitcoin exchanges.
As for the wiring to Italy, my point is that you simply will never be able to do this with this old-school system we've all been forced to endure for so long that it SEEMS normal to you.
You really need to look at where the trust in fiat currency is at the moment, and where it could be in the future to understand my arguments. Most people refuse to do this, if that's the case with you, then good luck, god speed. Bitcoin perhaps isn't for you just yet.

Listen bro, I know you're European but when you're talking about bitcoins you should probably change the way you write the numbers.
For example, what you just said, in bitcoin terms, looks like seven hundred and fourty four point four zero eight bitcoins.
744 and change.
What you should probably say is 744408 bitcoins. 
To be fair, as time goes on, numbers greater than 1000 bitcoins will become more rare and this will be less of an issue.

This is hilarious.
First of all, bitcoin transactions are increasingly becoming 'instant confirmation' and secondly, bitcoin isn't new, it's just newer. You say you use debit, but in 1989 what made you (or your parents most likely) start to think that you/they could switch from cash to debit?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:03:07

Hey man, property taxes + gasoline taxes etc pay for all that stuff, what you're talking about is the federal reserve system (where the income tax money goes to pay private banks interest on every dollar printed). Bitcoin works on a limited government system. You shouldn't be scared of it, but of the government.

No, A, you haven't yet realised a profit until you sell, and B, it looks like you're underwater still as you haven't mentioned any change in price per share.
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:50:15
Yeah, see there's no way it'll just flash crash, and if it did, that means that a lot of people are stupid, and sold their coins to the smart people who setup staggered buy orders at certain levels to reap the benefits. Maybe next dip people will learn from this, though that would mean that the price wouldn't drop as fast/far. It's a learning experience, with the noobs losing and the pros gaining.

Bitcoin only goes up bro.
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:12:23
I've had a look at your site, up at the top where it shows the currency you're dealing with, perhaps you could have the bitcoin show up as well, so people know what it'll cost them in BTC before they go through all the steps of ordering. If that doesn't appeal to you, maybe just toss a 'We accept Bitcoins' logo. It'll get you added to lists that are compiled here, garnering you more future business from bitcoiners.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:08:45
Can easily happen again, I predict that there -could- be a correction to 80 or 82, based on the minimal amount needed to sell in order to achieve such a price point. Then a surge back up to 90 again. It all depends on where people are placing their buy orders. Makes sense.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:23:06

Bullish for silver, as it is used in solar power applications. Also it'd make a damn good heat sink.
Lol, as a disclosure I own silver. I'm not trying to prompt anyone to buy it, as I think bitcoin is a better investment, but it's worth mentioning that they may work hand in hand respectively.

No. Bitcoin is meant to be traded, and I honestly believe there'll come a day where 1 coin is far too much money for one person to hold onto. Eventually we'll all be dealing with fractions of coins and still hold much wealth with them.

I got invited to go to a ACN thing, it was so scummy. She didn't tell me what it was, except a business teaching course. I did some research before hand based on where I was meeting her and saw ACN, read about it being a pyramid scheme, and went anyway. Didn't like the behavior of individuals. Bitcoin is much different.

Oh, I read it wrong, thought you said bitcoin had a 20% gain. So you're saying that the price per share went up 20%? You need it to double in order to get your 1 BTC back because you bought it at 2x what people are willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:20:00

OP here, see my video below your last comment, I went and found it.
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:01:27
"Why didn't I concur!?!"
@_date: 2013-03-27 04:19:12
I'm not sure I follow. If a share costs 1btc to buy in and then it gets bought up more, driving the shareprice to 10btc, then you could sell that share for 10btc because that's what someone's willing to pay for that share. Now - if you look at the Havelock mining company for example, the alltime chart... the price drove up a bunch, and then it was decided they'd do a share split, 1:10. It's really rather much like the stock market. Annual yield dividends and everything. I like it so far. "made" more bitcoins, even though it's not profit until you actually cash out of the stocks.
@_date: 2013-03-31 20:18:19

@_date: 2013-04-17 05:40:20
If you think you purchasing at $90 will make the price go to $90 you're wrong. It'll stay wherever it is, and possibly move slightly higher.
Bigger question, did you pay someone to buy bitcoins for you for 90 dollars each, and have them delivered later? Because they will probably be buying them for the 70 dollars that it is right now, or perhaps it does make it up to 90, or 120, or 50, or 10. or 1000. Who knows. Needless to say, it wont affect the market.

Regarding  Companies can use Bitpay to automatically accept the bitcoins and convert to USD (I believe, research this).
Bitcoins cannot be confiscated by banks (talk very briefly about Cyprus) There are no storage fees, you can transfer them anywhere across the globe for a tiny fraction of the amount that you'd pay for a bankwire. This is the single biggest thing bitcoin has going for it right now.

There's an amazing video on youtube that gets into it and ways to predict the way the market will move with them based on Japanese rice traders from way back. Anyhow, they work like this... A green candle would mean that the price started at say, $50 usd/bitcoin and ended up at $60, and the wick of the candle high and low is where it got to during that time, like the highest/lowest prices, before it settled. A red candle means it started higher and ended lower. Any other advice you need just message me I'm happy to help, though I'm extremely new to bitcoin, it's the same as any other market.

Ok, when the dragon guy asked buddy if he can convert his usd to bitcoin send them to Switzerland and if they could then use them, the fucking answer is YES.
How so you say? 
1) You can use bitspend to purchase ANYTHING for you online with bitcoins and have it shipped to you from the supplier.
2) You can sell the coins for the local currency.
3) Many companies are starting to adopt the currency as a method of payment, which is part of the reason you're doing this interview, awareness campaign.

Jeez, it's so easy. What the poster is saying is that you should place a order say 10 - 20 USD below the current price, for when the correction happens you will be able to snap up some coins at a good price.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:45:05
This is high frequency trading bots in action. However, they're not pushing the price up or down imo, you HAVE to buy through and sell through walls.
For example, if I have a bitcoin set to sell at 900 USD, but the current price is 130, you -cannot- buy my bitcoin to jack the price up to 900 without first buying everyone else's FIRST.
Take this example to a smaller scale, and all you're seeing is someone buying up all the tiny micro trades that a bot has spread out, on their quest to purchase a small amount of coin.
Does this make sense?

It's no pyramid bud. I see where you're trying to draw the comparison from, but if you really look at it, it's just controlled inflation. The only reason the early adopters are making 'so much' money, is because they worked their asses off for it when everyone called them fools. Much like anything else in life, KFC founder for example, didn't he try and work his recipe at hundreds of places before it took off?

To each their own. Bro if you look at the buy orders propping up the price you'd clearly see that there's a fair bit of support at the $50 level. Something disastrous would have to happen to drop it back to 10 from here.

The ONLY reason to go off the gold standard is the god damn Vietnam war. The US needed to print lots of money, and since it was tied to gold, it didn't have enough, and had to end the gold standard in 1971.

Hi, I would like to create the exact scenario you've mentioned above, however I have a few issues.  I have addresses that I may have given out to people in the past, if I create a new wallet, is there a way to auto-send transactions from that wallet to the new one? If not, can I just turn my wallet into the blockchain.info wallet and then start a new one for day to day transactions? Thirdly, I am planning on scribing the wallet address into some metal and then burying it somewhere for safe keeping, which codes do I need to burn to access the wallet later?
I know this is a lot of info to ask but can you answer, or point me in the right direction? Thanks very much.

The reason they all wanted to ask how to outlaw it, is that the whole game of cards that is the banking system will crumble to pieces and all of the major players will have to give up their money for nothing fiat printing riches and actually do some fucking work for once. That's why that question came up so much.
My answer is of course it'll still function, did prohibition work? No, war on drugs? No, bailouts? NO! Anything at all in the history of the world that the government has tried to control? NO.

Are you saying as a vendor because of the deflationary nature of bitcoin the price rises, thus lowering the bitcoin cost of your goods at a steady pace is a problem? In the end it's all the same.

@_date: 2013-04-08 13:53:12
Honestly, if they're so worried about it, then tell them to print ~~some~~ a shitload more euro's and buy as many bitcoins as they can from the people. They are likely to get mine if the price is 10 million each. Then, as controllers of all of the bitcoins, they can get rid of them once and for all.
I actually support this idea, I'd like the bank to bail me out for once.

@_date: 2013-03-29 00:12:57
I think that the higher the price goes, the more hands each bitcoin will be in, and it will become more of a currency rather than a commodity. For example: I know that at some point, if bitcoins are worth 10k, someone with 100,000 of them is NOT going to keep them all. If someone even has 100k of them right now, they are sitting in a very risky position. They will get rid of some coins by trading/selling/buying with them. Now, the higher the price goes, the more this should happen, until realistically it's very rare to see anyone with more than 10 btc, in the future. That's the way I see it.

Someone cashing out all at once, not enough buy orders in place for it to sustain a large dump like that. It's really a stupid way to sell your coins but it happens. You sell all at once and instead of getting 94 for each BTC you end up selling lots at 93 92 90 88 85 etc.

@_date: 2013-03-28 20:52:01
The way I see it, we only just hit 80 yesterday or 2 days ago, people need time to react and setup buy orders adjusted to large price hikes. What I mean is, people obviously had buy orders at 85, and could have meant to up them to say 90, but we hit 90 too fast for that to really happen, and so a sudden drop really affected the market. It's going to be volatile, as it should. Learn from this.
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:52:42
sigh, ok.... let me spell what I mean out for you
You are a big player, you have 1 million dollars and place all of it to buy bitcoin at 50 dollars.
I am a smallish player, and I have 5000 dollars and want to get my bitcoins, do I:
Place the order at 49 dollars?
Place the order at 50 dollars and be the same as a huge support wall?
Place the order at 50.01 dollars?
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:31:03
Yes, of course. they are worth way more than this

It's like sitting on a leaky pipe instead of fixing the pipe. Sure, it stopped the leak, but there's now a buttload of pressure building up and you can't even get off of it in order to fix it if you even wanted to!! It is the end now, because of the patches. (bailout)

This is incorrect. Think of it this way, if you have 1 large lasagnia. You divide it into 100 pieces. It's the smallest way you know how to divide it. You can feed 100 people with it. Now, there's 1000 people in your establishment and someone shows you a way to divide it further, though in lesser portions, to each person. NO NEW LASAGNIA is being created.

Fair enough, and litecoin is apparently much faster, however, how do you think people are going to deal with all these different coins? Plus, some of them are super sketchy and often 'premined' comes up when speaking about them. So I just daytraded them to grow my stack.

I just don't like people trying to manipulate a free market. Start your own site and see how it goes, if it goes bust, obviously your business model wasn't good enough. If it's amazing, people will flock there from Mt. Gox because that's what free markets do.

Bud, you need to chill out. I am invested heavily in silver, a little bit of gold, and invested a minor amount in bitcoin, so far bitcoin has actually made me a ton of money, and I expect it to do a lot more. I eventually expect my gold and silver to do things too. They all have their place, and for you to condemn others on their investment choices makes me sad to call myself a fellow silver stacker. Grow up or go home

Bitcoin is divisible, infinitely. No cap. You could look at it like this, one day a satoshi might be worth $1. People will have used their bitcoins to purchase things, spreading them through the populous. It's entirely possible that no one person is going to have 1 whole bitcoin at some point in the future. It would just be worth so much at that point. This is all hypothetical but I hope you see where I'm going with this. 
It's also not a debt based system, so there's no -need- to constantly keep increasing the money supply just to have the ability to pay for the interest that is accrued.

@_date: 2013-03-25 21:48:18
Listen, if you were to do something like this... the way to go about it is having a sell order listed for say $60 and a buy order at $30 $20 $10 $5 $2 $1 etc.
What this would do is sell your bitcoins automatically when the price dropped to $60 and if it were to keep tumbling down you start to pick them up at 30 20 10 5 2 and 1. Honestly, it's not a bad idea, I could see myself doing something like this with a small amount of my total bitcoins, just as a hedge. Also, having staggered buys like that also helps prop up the market. 
Buying high and then selling low because the price went down is really... I want to say stupid, but, I'll go with naive. It's a sure-fire way to lose.

The sad fact about all of this is people who are new to bitcoin like myself are spending days mining to get the equivalent of a 0.1 USD (at the current rate) and see people tossing bitcoin around like it's -garbage-. Look at the leaderboard ffs. I'm not saying you can't do what you want with your money, but if we're trying to build a system that people want to partake in, can't we display a better image around it?

People are liquidating their bitcoins. Do you really think that there's a shitload of people with 50,000 bitcoins in their wallets? No. Did there used to be? Sure, and they sold off some, took profits, and they were released to new people. As the price continues to rise, the risk of having too many bitcoins increases, and people will continue to release them to more and more people. Eventually I suspect that 1 BTC will be more than anyone ever needs, and we'll be talking about satoshis for everyday purchases.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:29:57
I just wanna say, a few months ago, I got pretty big into silver because of that website, and it's where I learned about bitcoins actually, only recently though. I am upset that most of the people there are bitcoin haters even though bitcoin is virtually (pun intended) the exact same thing as gold and silver are, when comparing them against the fiat currencies out there that the government can print at will. PLUS it has the added bonus of being easy to move and hide. 
I find myself more on reddit's bitcoin website now rather than SilverDoctors, even though I have only 100 dollars of bitcoin and had about 30k of the other, though my silver is all at the bottom of a lake now due to my boating accident :(
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:22:35
