We are likely going to add an option to support the Joinmarket IRC protocol as it is one of the most used. However we have a new protocol drawn out for IRC that should reduce bandwidth and message count. Ideally we would like to make a dedicated server, as to reduce bandwidth and improve privacy, however hardening the software of such a server is fairly time intensive.

A completely new privacy solution that will likely support interfacing with the Joinmarket IRC server.

The current plan is to incrementally release tools in the suite (wallet-tool.py, tumbler-tool.py, ect.) as well as the protocol specs in the upcoming weeks via github
Edit: The logic behind releasing the tools incrementally is to make sure all of the functions work as intended on multiple systems before releasing a tool that relies on the stability of the previous one.

Although I have considered that idea, we are planning on making an entire suite of utilities designed to be decentralized, it would make more sense to create a new client. Currently all of the tools are CLI, we have tested a few basic GUIs but decided to work on more technical aspects until we can get a more artistic person on-board. Thank you for your comments, I appreciate it.

Yeah, it does seem like a huge amount of work summed up into a single post, but my team and I are experienced in this field and are trying to make sure we develop something worthwhile, something that people will use and get use out of
