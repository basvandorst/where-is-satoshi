Large transaction fees and having very little integration besides being a money dump. The whole point of currency is that you spend it. But for a community of people who blame the top 1% for hoarding their currency in an offshore bank account. We really miss the point.
 Imagine having a credit card that charged you 10% just for using it vs another credit card that was $0.50. Which one would you choose?
Imagine if it took you three hours to buy groceries with that 10% credit card. Vs . The other one that does it in seconds. Which would you choose?
Bitcoin cash fixed two of these issues and people were livid over it. Still the problem remains until you start using it as a currency or using the tech for other things, it is driving off a cliff.

If I've learned anything from the graphic examples provided, it is that a crash is "foretold" by a sudden increase then decrease..... then followed by an eventual increase by a small margin once the dust settles.
Moral of the story, it takes time to accumulate worth.

On one hand. Yes. I would be scared that such a thing happened, let alone could happen
On the other hand. This is not like when bitcoin started and no one knows what bitcoin was. It is globally accepted. It would bounce back eventually.

I didn't think I would see it dive below the 2k mark so soon. But that's the UPS and downs. I expect it to hit 1.6k in a week or stabilize around 1.7k. If it dips below 1.5k I'll invest more. 
Probably won't see it back at 2k for awhile though. Thankfully I am a patient man, so I'll sit here and watch for a for a few months
