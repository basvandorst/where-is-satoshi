And yet thousands of people do it daily. If only there was subreddit where people could talk about what BTC is, and how people are buying, selling, and using BTC for purchases for things like PC parts, hotels, [or even gas in Colorado]( / [and Malaysia]( / [and Pakistan]( among other countries.

What? I was just responding to the last two sentences. Newegg isn't the only place that accepts BTC. But let's get all ragey about it.
Edit: Obligatory

O &lt;&lt; your stupid fucking head

Nothing about your post implies it is in a third-world setting now does it? No, it doesn't. The OP is talking about handing out flyers in bus stations, train stations, grocery stores, etc. Not the third world. My point stands that you can buy shit online with BTC at more than just Newegg. The fact you're trying to make it more than that to validate yourself is amusing, although apparently everyone else is just as blind.

If you want to insult me over the internet, at least use proper grammar.
Edit: Back to the original point, I don't know exactly what you want to call "third world," but here's [a map if you want to see where exactly takes bitcoin](
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:25:47
(You still forgot the apostrophe)
Your point was nowhere in third world countries do my comments apply, because nowhere takes BTC. I'm showing you that some places do and it's an ever-expanding network. I'm not trying to say one is better than the other.

I mined 3BTC on an HD5750 when they were under $2USD each. Bitchplz.
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:11:30


I see what you did there
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:41:48
\^ **those** were the good old days. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:31:48
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:47:37
Member when you could mine an entire coin on an HD5750 but saw no point because they were only going for pennies? ._.
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:41:38
Can confirm; I mined my own 3 coins back when they were pennies, sold at $200.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:23:47
Yeah I held my 3 until we hit $200 and was like 'no way it keeps going up'. Oh well, it was still $600 free.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:48:13
Truth. I mined 3 and was ecstatic when it hit $200 and sold.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:27:55
I mined 3 when they were cheap (on an HD 5750 for time-frame), forgot about em for a couple years, almost shit myself when it hit $100, held till $200 and said no way it keeps going and sold. FeelsBadMan
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:06:33
You laugh but I sold my 3btc at $200 because that was insane compared to the sub-$2 it was when I started. Billionaire, probably not, but that .01 could be worth a fair bit down the line. 
@_date: 2016-10-02 05:26:09
Yeah I mined like 3 in a week back in.......the late 2000s, running it only at night on my HD5750 I believe it was. They were selling for $1 or less at the time. 
Sold them when I checked back into BTC and saw $200 a coin. Should have held out, c'est la vie. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:28:46
I mean I did mine three bitcoins and then sold them when BTC hit 200$ for the first time. So idk what other bullshit you're talking about. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:56:25
sooo... how does it work then? can't just call someone out and not debunk what they've said.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:30:35
I mined 3 on my 5750 back in the day. Sold when it hit 200 because that's amazing compared to the .25-$2 price when I started. D:
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:52:00
Forgive me for not being 100% accurate, I see it's bothered you. Let's just say in Bitcoin's infancy then. I was mining on an HD5750 back in the day, somewhere before 2012. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 03:41:46
Still nothing yet for my credit union (PSECU) T_T the pains of using a small local bank. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:45:56
It's literally 90% true, I just overguestimated the actual year I mined and sold. Hence my original reply to him saying 'so we'll say in bitcoins infancy'
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:58:36
I had mined three ten years ago, sold them when BTC hit $200 thinking *that* was insane (considering when I was actively mining 1 BTC = $0.03)
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:55:44
Well, that's what I plan on doing, so consider me alright ;)
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:32:11
My answer is to do what I can to mine the most net BTC with my current setup until I can afford to ASIC farm and/or buy straight BTCs. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:17:06
I mine LTC at a faster rate than BTC because LTC doesn't allow ASIC, so the difficulty increases slower.
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:55:58
Its okay; I need to pay on a couple things too so I just sold my 3 I mined years ago for $120 each.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:21:09
Except they're in development, so until they are available and in use, LTC mining nets more gains than BTC for me.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:48:06
Until it does, LTC mining is more profitable to me without shelling out for an ASIC. ;)
