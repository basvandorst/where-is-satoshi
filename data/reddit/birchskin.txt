Yeah I had a lot of fallout from reusing passwords on the mtgox leak. The benefit is that I have much better passwords that are all unique these days.

That penalty is a bitch, I took out a lower amount a few years back and I lost something like 40%

That's horrible and hilarious. I've seen at least 2 people fired in my career for sending out emails and then recalling - the recall feature is stupid and only serves to draw more scrutiny over what was "off" in the original email.

If your identity was stolen and you used target and mtgox there is no way for you to know where that originated, so I don't see a real problem here.

Judging by OPs history, I'd guess he is just high as fuck right now. So high that basic multiplication is eluding him.

I can only hit F5 so many times on so many tabs, and they aren't feeding the itch fast enough!

I imagine this guy blurting out something about bitcoins in the middle of a classroom with nothing triggering the conversation.
You might as well walk into a room with 30 people in it and just blurt out aimlessly, "Would anyone like to accept Jesus into their hearts?" - no one wants to hear it.

So why is localbitcoin allowed to operate? Is it just that individual sellers can more easily ignore regulation?
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:55:05
Just to play devils advocate, I basically never have to go into a brick and mortar bank, ever. I can do most everything online, and things I can't I can do with an ATM 24/7
Don't get me wrong, there are huge benefits to bitcoin. Banking hours aren't one of them.

Is this confirmation? Or just speculation/reassurance on a potential issue from big names?
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:58:09
Paying with bitcoin would bypass that, since there currently isn't a way to put a temporary hold on a bitcoin transaction
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:34:55
2011, I was in that leak but iirc it was usernames and unsalted but hashed passwords, they didn't have much else personal info. Or maybe someone is running around with my identity already....

Should we take tiny strips of bacon from the sandwich to act as the transaction ledger as the sandwich changes hands? I realize this is a self-deflating mechanism, but I don't see a way around it that doesn't end with no more bacon on the sandwich.

I just posted this elsewhere, but it looks like coinbase changed the language in their letter again:


Original here: 
In my mind this confirms that they were acting on internal insolvency news, albeit probably earlier than they were supposed to. Still just speculation, but one of the big names added a bit of confirmation to the statement.
Edit because it's apparently a living document: 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:21:34
If you wanted to force it to fit it would probably be Fear or Capitulation part 3 or 4.... But this is just a human way of trying to categorize things that can't really be categorized so easily, so it doesn't matter.

My quick calculations show me 1Bike=20000btc

Were you so excited that your hands were shaking, hence the awful picture quality?
What do the brochures say?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:54:53
There was a change in language on the joint letters again - 


Not that that is really verification, but it is a better source than re/code...

Is that so? You've calculated the odds? I think making $10,000,000 from $1 in lotto or btc are equally unlikely. Even $20 is a tough shot.
But at least you can admit it's a gamble.
@_date: 2014-06-09 05:12:33
I'm not a troll, but I feel like a large portion of this community is completely delusional, which attracts the "trolling" type . Does that count? 
I don't presently hold any bitcoin. I've bought and sold at all the wrong times over the years ($20 to $1000) - but I'm still "up" overall just not a lot considering when I first bought.
Here are some posts I've seen in the rising queue, upvoted, in the last few days that make the community worth trolling, if I were a troll, summarized because I'm on mobile;
-Does anyone have a DOS tool we can run on a PC to stop ghash.io? (and 1000 similar) 
-Gold is worthless because someone got sold a fake gold bar once
-Banks aren't open on Sunday so the world obviously needs bitcoin
-It's impossible for me to get a credit card, bitcoin is the only way for me to function.
-How did you fuck up with bitcoin that you would come here and trash talk? 
So, while btc never burned me, and I'm not a pro government liberal or keynsian socialist (wtf?) AND I see the benefit of bitcoin and truly believe it is world-changing, I also think there are a lot of morons in the community that tend to be louder, therefore attracting trolls.
tl;dr: stupid people teasing stupid people
@_date: 2014-06-04 05:51:14
Don't you understand? Any amount of bitcoin is enough to change the world. Just by utilizing it as a store of value, no matter how small, you are being an agent of change.
To answer your question: drugs. I'd spend it all on drugs.

Cabbage exchange rate is probably more stable. Though I suppose there's a shelf life, and you wouldn't want to risk converting cabbage to sauerkraut and selling that.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:28:09
Best odds are 98%, if you send a bunch of small transactions totaling 100BTC you should get 98btc back - but not the same ones you sent since it won't be verified yet. So for a 2% fee you can obfuscate the origin of your coins.
Edit: you also are risking losing 100% of the time, though it is unlikely. If your btc was ill-gotten and you need to hide the origin though, it could be used to tumble like this.

In outlook there is a recall feature. IIRC it works internally i n an exchange server if no one has opened the message. Externally it just sends a blank message with "Recall" as part of the subject line, leaving the original message and making you look like an idiot.

Sure she can, she doesn't even need to open the thing first.
A concise letter is different than a lazy letter. You can't make a ridiculous claim that the NY financial sector is going to become obsolete because of bitcoin regulation without backing it up with detail.

I feel like I should give you a high-five or something for the collaboration there...

You lose me at, "it isn't worth my effort" - if I was Dana, I'd throw it in the trash because it isn't worth my effort to read any further. Also you point out others have complained about specifics- how do you know they have? Who cares if she's seen 100 letters that have the same points, if you feel compelled enough to write a letter, go into specifics. This basically just says, "I don't like it because of what everyone else said"

As are people who buy speculative cryptocurrencies as a retirement plan.
