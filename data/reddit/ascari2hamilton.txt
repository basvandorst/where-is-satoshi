You're an expert too, i see. BTC up a whole -16% in the last week... that's negative 16% if you can't understand numbers. Keep buying and and keep thinking you're smarter than everyone else. I'm sure you'll end up just fine.

@_date: 2018-08-12 20:52:33
So true. The whole thing reeks. Reading comments to the SEC, it's mainly just fools who bought above $15k hoping there are dumber people that will prop up the price so they can recoup their losses. Ironic. These people thought this would change the game and make the Feds irrelevant. Now they're going to the feds with their hands out like beggars hoping to get Fed approval. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:14:18
I agree, they shouldn't know. And in almost all circumstances they won't care what you buy. It's only when they should care that it matters, and that's for illegal activities. In that case, don't you want there to be a paper trail to make it easier to catch criminals?

It's not premised on that. It's premised on principal goals of monetary policy which is based on science and history. You claim that history tells us you're right and I'm wrong. I don't know what history you're looking at. This is not a dick-measuring contest. So far, you're completely wrong. Tell me, when was the last time you used bitcoin to buy something compared to fiat? If it's not 100% bitcoin, then you're very wrong buddy.

I got into a similar discussion with some idiot when bitcoin was at $11k, and he/she was saying the same stupid stuff you're saying. I'm actually trying to help you. You think this is a debate. I'm just trying to stop you from losing your money like an idiot. You dumbasses keep eating your hats and proclaiming you still know what you're doing. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything. And it's really sad.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:47:14
Well, you said don't be negative, and you obviously don't want to hear anything negative, so... blind positivity. If I want to make an investment in a stock, I want to hear everything negative about it. That's how you make smart decisions. You don't just fall in love with one and keep buying it no matter the price, and surround yourself with confirmation bias. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:56:25
It's an inflationary currency, which works well for economic growth and making the whole society wealthier. You're not wrong. Think of this in terms of incentives. The last thing you want is a deflationary currency, which promotes hoarding (think of the hodler and accumulation mentality of bitcoin buyers..., it's just hoarding in a different name). You want an inflationary currency to incentivise investment and consumer buying. This makes everyone wealthier, if you think about it. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:46:24

@_date: 2018-08-12 22:17:57
You know, I read this comment really, REALLY trying to be enlightened and learn something. Unfortunately, i just came out of it knowing you're an overconfident, ignorant idiot who just wants to hear what you want to hear and nothing else. When I make an investment, I want to know everything bad about it before committing. You're making all the arguments for me. Thanks for that.

The banks are in a capitalist system. If you're uncomfortable with how much info they're collecting, you can switch to a different bank or a local credit union. You're right that they now collect personal information for advertising purposes, which is unfortunate, but as long as there are fiat currency options more convenient than bitcoin, bitcoin dies.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:02:07
This proves that you would rather have you head filled with confirmation bias than all the facts. Not a good investor trait. Blind positivity. Blind belief in an unproven investment. And no questioning. You're fucked my friend. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:07:02
That's not true. This should be understood. Deflationary currencies destroy economies, and if you think about it, this should be very intuitive. Use that brain. Why would anyone spend what they had if they know their currency will be worth more tomorrow? It's a huge disincentive. My facts come from a broad scope of learning, not a confirmation bias party like this sub. Please, consider the fact that your mind is not open and resist the urge to belittle those who know more than you. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:51:56

Go for it. Keep investing in a flawed asset. I want to tell you it's stupid, but you won't believe it. That's on you. It'll be a funny reckoning. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:49:00
The argument is: markets always beat inflation in the long term. So investing your devaluing currency pays off huge in the long term. You seem to be missing this very basic point.
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:34:07
Your scope in thinking is too limited for this discussion. I'm not talking about mere economic growth, which can happen simply with population increase and resource depletion. I'm talking about the most optimal deployment of capital to make an entire society wealthier. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:57:48
When an asset with no valuation metrics goes through a worldwide speculative bubble where nobody hasn't heard of it, like bitcoin did last December, the ensuing crash exhausts the supply of dumb speculators on a global level. Waiting around for the price to go up is literally the same as hoping the dumb speculators come back, but there is no convincing motivation for stupider people to come back. Hoping an ETF will help with losses stinks of the dumbest money still hoping there are dumber people out there. You'd think this scam has run its course. But, the pump and dump schemes keep continuing, and the dumbest keep losing. Amazing. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:37:50
Haha... you have a gift. Sadly it's not worth anything. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:36:12
There will continue being pump and dump swings, but not a +1000% buildup. Bubbles just don't do doubles.
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:18:52
There are degrees to inflation. Yes, rampant inflation is bad. But, the science says that moderate, controlled inflation is good. The studies indicate an inflation rate of around 2% is optimal for growth. This is just good enough to prevent hoarding, and incentivizes spending/investment.
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:45:16
If you put $1k in the S&amp;P 500 in 1950, and that's the only investment you ever made, you'd have $5 million now. Time and patience wins every time. Gimmicks rarely work. If you're obsessed with "storing value," you could've put that $1k in gold, and have about $40k now. I prefer investing in progress.

@_date: 2018-08-12 21:56:58
For what purpose though? This is why bitcoin is used for illicit activities like drug dealing and hired assassinations. But, for normal people buying groceries and such, there is no reason to use it and never will be. Especially if the theory proves correct, that it will keep increasing in value. In that case, why would anybody use it as a currency?

That's not what's happening. Yes, printing money by the fed happens after an economic crash. But money burning also happens when inflation gets too high.

Or, you can dollar cost average for 35 years and have $5 million. Point is, if you're going to compare BTC with USD, you have to also include stock markets in that comparison. No one "invests" by buying USD, unless they're stupid.

Yours is totally flawed. The fact that you respond immediately like a little kid with his ego hurt by factoids is very revealing.

It inherently has a limited supply. By definition it's deflationary. If USD kept its value, we'd have a big problem with economic stagnation. Less capital deployment means less spending, less jobs, less investment. I know it's tempting to argue that USD is worth less than 5% of what it did 100 years ago, but it's not a value store. It's a currency. But if you deployed USD into the markets it would be worth more than 10,000% more now. The markets and optimism about social progress win out in the end. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:45:22
Stop thinking you're "fighting." Nobody is fighting. You're just buying bitcoin and not using it. Keep up you "silent work" of continuously educating. That's probably your problem. You think others need educating instead of yourself. Never works well to have that attitude in the investing world. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:39:54
Learn your their, there, and they'res. Otherwise, don't count on ETF approval to boost the price. It didn't do anything for gold. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:06:06
Don't outsmart yourself. You should dedicate these reasoning skills to learning scientific facts about these things. There's too much conspiracy thinking and frankly lazy beliefs among the bitcoin crowd. The ONLY countries with negative rates are Sweden, Switzerland, and Japan, and their rates are close to zero. You're overblowing this effect. The U.S. has never had negative rates. You are right that this has the effect of overvaluing things like equities and real estate. But it's a total myth that somehow bitcoin is safer. When equities went into correction in February, you would have expected bitcoin to rise, especially if it is the safe money haven people promise it is. Instead, it crashed by 60%. There are much better strategies out there to avoid losing in a market crash. If you're so certain one is coming soon, why not short the S&amp;P 500 and make money betting against it? There are ETFs that do this. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:43:11

@_date: 2018-08-12 21:39:15

@_date: 2018-08-08 07:50:03
That is not a good reason to accuse the investing world of being narrow minded. A 60% crash in 6 months with little hope of recovery is evidence that this supposed investment is dead. Only dumb money and pump and dump schemers are still in it...
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:41:36
So, who are you accusing of being narrow minded? Why should people "hodl" bitcoin when it's dropped 60% this year? And why should people buy bitcoin because of these things? All bullshit aside, if this was a bubble, then it burst in December 2017. Nobody is narrow minded for believing so. And this silly one year return you're focusing on..., come back in 5 months with the same argument.

@_date: 2018-08-12 20:58:31
It's deflationary by nature, which makes it a great value store. But, for those owning bitcoin, there is no incentive to use it as a currency if the belief is that it will be worth more later. The deployment of capital is what makes economies grow. Hoarding will only stagnate growth or result in collapse. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:36:23

When what? Currency collapse? USD? I'm sorry, but BTC is about a thousand times more probable to collapse than USD.

I see it differently. If it had a better practical effect of making economies grow and make people wealthier than fiat, then it's an inevitable replacement. But, its fundamental nature makes it completely impractical as a future currency.

I understand, and appreciate this. People want Bitcoin to be a currency? Why do they also want an ETF for it? That goes completely counter to the currency argument. There is no ETF for usd, i.e. any other currency. It would delegitimize the whole argument that it is a revolutionary currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 06:04:54
I don't like the Fed. Nobody needs any permission to use any currency they want. I don't give two shits about anyone using bitcoin. It's all good. Just know that ignorance about the Fed has resulted in a lot of humiliation. I read Ray Dalio's "Principles", and he openly admitted to his ignorance/stupidity about the Fed in the early 80s. He was on the news stating that we were heading for great depression. The fed jacked rates to 25%, disintegrated inflation, caused a minor recession, and then we went into an economic boom. I don't like them. But, they're scientific and know more than you or I will ever know. I respect that. You should too.
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:56:00
No you're bringing in mining, and you've mixed up causation. Silver price, like gold, is roughly negatively correlated to the stock market (stocks rise, silver drops). If you need an explanation, look it up. When stocks are up, silver and gold trend to go down, which means less profit for miners, so they shut down. It's simple. The alternative is what you're talking about, a bunch of manipulating overlords that shut down mines in order to make money shorting silver and making the price move via derivatives. This isn't GI Joe.

And this is the problem with a deflationary asset. It causes people to hoarde rather than use it as a currency. You're always waiting for someone else to start changing the system while you keep hoarding. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:43:41
You're mixing up the terms "store of value" and "currency." These should be thought of as different concepts. Why do you think gold isn't used as currency anymore? It induced hoarding. Bitcoin would be "sound money" if it was actually used as money, but its not. Bitcoin enthusiasts are accumulating, and not using it as money. Thus is simply hoarding, which was the same problem gold had.

In other words, pass the losses onto institutions who the losers (who bought at $15k+) believe will diversify portfolios by buying a bitcoin ETF? It makes no sense. An ETF follows an index. Bitcoin is not an index. Why would someone would buy a bitcoin ETF and pay an expense ratio instead of just buying bitcoin? You lost money because you speculated on a risky investment. The SEC does not exist so your stupidity can go unpunished. Funny how people invest in bitcoin because they believe the entire economic system and USD will collapse, but have no problem crawling to the feds begging for a handout. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 15:18:23
"access to bitcoin exposure..."  Actually, they can buy bitcoin whenever they want, and some of the banks do. If you want it to be more legitimate, what needs to happen is an easier way to short bitcoin. This whole ETF talk just reeks of bitcoin holders wanting to recoup losses by thinking there's dumber money out there. But there isn't. People who bought above 10k are the dumbest money out there
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:25:04
And you take the slightest hint of an argument against your idiotic conspiracy theory as an invitation to have a dick-measuring contest (I bet yours is really tiny), and to brag and lie about your supposed wealth. Again, you're not fooling anybody so cut it out kiddo....  Don't you know millionaires don't troll reddit midday? And for the record, can you state your opinion again? I want to make sure I have it correct. The NSA invented bitcoin to spy on us, or something? Please, enlighten me again. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:59:03
And there you have it folks (as if anyone is reading this). The logical depth to this sham is 3 layers deep. Just admit that this ETF idea is only about a stupid attempt to boost the price to recoup losses and be done with it. No one is falling for it. Bitcoin buyers in fall 2017 were the dumbest money out there. Institutions are not dumber. Stop thinking that they are. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 15:18:35
I've been getting downvoted like crazy trying to say how stupid a bitcoin ETF would be. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:13:32
But, that already happened... last year. You think it'll happen again?
@_date: 2018-07-21 04:42:49
No. An ETF that tracks one stock is not an ETF. It's a scam. You could just buy the fucking stock.
@_date: 2018-07-21 03:29:42
Not happening. Stupid idea. Don't ask. It's just stupid. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:33:41
Why?

I'm the guy that needs to be convinced for it to happen. You can't convince a normal person, you won't convince the SEC.

I guess until it gets above 20k, they're still loser hodlers. Yeah, they're total loser sodlers no matter what. But, i don't think the moon is happening. They'd be better off yodling.
@_date: 2018-07-21 04:53:32
It did not. But this is a good point. The gold ETF was created so that people who couldn't afford to buy actual gold and store it, could pay a fee to invest in it. Since 2003, that investment has returned pretty much 0% (inflation adjusted). With bitcoin, I can just buy it without the fee. Why pay a fee to buy an ETF that just buys bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:40:54
Or just buy bitcoin through a brokerage like Robinhood and pay no fees.
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:00:27
Yeah right... you don't know shit and you make stupid assumptions. You're weak minded and if anyone had to deal with this nonsense you're spouting, they'd stop working with you. So, you're not fooling anybody and you are wasting brainpower.
@_date: 2018-07-22 05:05:46
No one who is this naive about the Fed should ever have power. Politicizing the Fed would destroy its ability to stay independent and mitigate economic harm for all of us. Libertarians have been trying this for decades, and it's out of sheer ignorance. It needs to stop.
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:02:53
So you're successful beyond everyone's wildest dreams, but you check post histories of people you argue with... hahahahaha! To quote Jim Carrey, "man, you are one pathetic loser."
Again, you assume, stupidly. I'm 10 years out of grad school. You've seriously taken this conspiracy stuff too far, and you're failing in becoming a rational, thoughtful person. Just telling you to fucking relax. Which, honestly, you need to... 
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:03:20
We do not want public funds (e.g., pensions) invested in crypto. It's too risky and volatile and a 20% downturn will invite regulatory action. No 401ks, no roboinvestors, no funds of funds. The person needs to be the one pulling the trigger and buying crypto directly. Keep accountability on the individual. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 04:50:00
That's all good. I'm just saying, a bitcoin ETF is a worthless idea that's not worth talking about. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:29:50
You call them assholes, and you ask them to create an ETF for you. That's smart.
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:26:41
You're right that it's not fixed, but you're off about the reason. There is zero impact on the prices of gold and silver by derivative trading. You also make no sense when saying "endless fiat money can dump value on all safe haven assets." What value? If there is increased demand for stable assets, it increases prices. There is no increased demand for bitcoin, that's why it's not increasing in price. You're mixing up the term "value" with "price." You should keep them separate. "Dumping value" i guess means diluting value? This would be true if you were talking about USD, but you're talking about precious metals. The value stays the same..., that's the whole point. USD devalues. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 04:40:11
It's clear you don't understand investing. You want institutions to pump the price of bitcoin. But it doesn't generate revenue. Why would any institution invest in something that is purely speculative?

Not a purchase

Make the argument for why they should approve. All they got was a bunch of comments from people who lost money hoping and ETF would boost the price to recoup losses. That's a horrible reason.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:39:09
Except the fact that there is a huge problem with it. We have many examples of what happens when currency is deflationary. Depression, economic collapse, stone age society. You talk about need. We only need food and water. Is that your ideal world? 
@_date: 2018-07-21 15:21:22
I'm the guy that needs to be convinced for it to happen. You can't convince a normal person, you won't convince the SEC
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:28:37
Not everything is a conspiracy. An ETF is supposed to be a blend of assets that track some index. Gold has an ETF because it's difficult to buy and store gold safely without cost. Not the same for bitcoin. You want to win this argument, convince me that this bitcoin ETF idea isn't just some stupid ploy to recoup losses for those who bought above 10k. If you can't convince me, you won't convince the SEC. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 03:00:40
The best way to lose all friends...

You think an SEC decision coinciding with futures expiring was market manipulation by the SEC? That's pretty delusional. Of course I missed that point. It's not a good point to make or be passionate about. You should focus more on the 20% swings as market manipulation. This "current dip" of a 0.3% GAIN in price is not the result of "defacto market manipulation" by the SEC. That's pretty silly.
@_date: 2018-07-21 03:41:33
Oh Christ. You can buy gold if you want... then you can store it and sell it as you please. A gold ETF with 0.83% expense ratio is just for speculators that think the price is going up. Bitcoin is not tangible. It's not like gold. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 03:24:49
Stop trying
@_date: 2018-07-21 05:23:10
So your argument is, "there's a lot of money over there, let's snatch some of it to pump up bitcoin prices." Am I getting this right? If not, articulate it better for me.

Good factoids...  thanks for the learnage. This is important. People tend to be dismissive of things they don't understand. A big problem when it comes to crypto enthusiasts and their opinions of the fed.

RH has about as much a chance of failing as ETrade. Even if they failed, it's not like you would lose your ownership in BTC or your stocks. You still own them, and an RH bankruptcy would cause your assets to be transferred to a management trust or receivership. I don't think an ETF would improve accessibility or safety. It wouldn't do anything except fool a few idiots into thinking btc is a safe investment, which might pump up the price to enable some to recoup losses.
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:16:38
You could easily say it, but it wouldn't make sense.

Places where Bitcoin can make a huge difference = places where the threat of rapid fiat devaluation &gt; Bitcoin volatility risk. It is tempting to think the US will experience an inflationary shock. Possible, but unlikely. It's the Venezuelas and the corrupt African and poorer Asian nations that would benefit from Bitcoin's value storage nature. Ironically, folks from wealthier secure nations are buying up almost all of it.

The Fed has no lobby. Arguably, they do corporate's bidding, but its policy lately has been full employment and ~2% inflation. So, it's a detached connection at best

No problem here. I love the idea of the SEC approving a fund for 20 or 25 people. But, why would they buy the ETF?
