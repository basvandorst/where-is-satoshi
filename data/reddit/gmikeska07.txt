The top line is BTCUSD price, The bottom chart is the ratio of the USD exchange rate to the GBP exchange rate of Bitcoin. I think this might show purchase of BTC in GBP to dump in USD. Does that make sense to anyone?

Good call... my terminology is wrong here. That being said, the definition of fungibility is a valid concern as well when it comes to blacklisting of coins, etc. But that's not germane to the discussion here.
@_date: 2015-06-21 01:16:22
No, this is not a solution. Every dollar in circulation is "backed" by a loan from the fed. They can't mint coins or bills that don't correspond to loans from the federal Reserve.

Correct! The powers that be are investing in using blockchain technology (yes, on Bitcoin's blockchain) to secure financial transactions, digital contracts, etc. 
What they don't realize is that once they depend on the blockchain, they can't do anything to hurt Bitcoin's fungibility without shooting themselves in the face! :-D

The currency portion, though "boring" is essential to the equation. If Bitcoin (the currency) loses fungibility, miners will no longer have an incentive to mine. Then, rogue pools will pop up that have a profit motive of defrauding the programmable system that rides the blockchain.
Also, as a side note, I think that when the forthcoming shake-out happens, the idea of currency free of government manipulation is going to be a whole lot more "interesting".

We need both. LN looks great, but I guarantee you that payment channeling will become a business model unto itself, and if we allow the block size to relegate smaller transactions to LN, we'll see bank-like businesses gain a foothold channeling micropayments and charging a fee for the privilege.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:04:54
That is, indeed, exactly how our banking system works. You misunderstand the gold note portion though. The cost of money's production has nothing to do with its inherent value and the value of the gold note wasn't created out of thin air: The government creates notes backed by gold held in reserves across the country and the $1 note mentioned in my example above represents $1 worth of gold in a government vault (probably as some share of a 400oz bar).
The point is that when a non-fiat currency is produced, the government gets to absorb some value by spending the currency into circulation, as opposed to borrowing it into circulation.
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:51:13
You're correct. I'm referring to taxpayers in this context. If there were a seignorage benefit to minting currency, the taxpayer would benefit, via a lower tax burden. Instead, we end up owing interest on all money in circulation.
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:18:32
Exactly! Governments under a Central Bank based system don't benefit from Seignorage. Instead of earning Seignorage from the minting of currency, they pay INTEREST TO THE BANKS in exchange for the minting of currency.
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:49:09
"difference between the value of money and the cost to produce and distribute it."
Since all dollars are borrowed into existence, the government reaps no value from money.

Well, the customer decides how much fee to pay. Actually, in many cases it would be more accurate to say that the customer's client software decides. Some end users may not know how to increase their fee payout.

I don't know... I'm using every spare scrap of the toilet paper I earn to buy Ag, Au, and BTC. 
I know BTC is the future, but I think gold and silver price drops have been because of the naked short selling, and I think they may come in handy if the lights go out. (yeah the blockchain will still be intact when things get up and running again, but in the mean time, I want to have some value on hand.)

No problem! Welcome to Yeah don't get me wrong! I use coinbase myself to purchase bitcoin... I just transfer my BTC out as soon as I purchase it. In general, you don't actually have to worry day-to-day. You only stand to lose access to your wallet if coinbase goes out of business or if you do something that violates the company's terms of service. That being said, those are the kinds of issues that fiat currency expose you to, and why I like cryptocurrency in the first place, so I reduce my exposure to those risks by just using coinbase as a purchase point.
I recommend the Trezor. It's a hack-resistant hardware wallet that makes it easy to keep your bitcoin safe. (

I think sides with Greece because, while Greek policies played a role, what we're really seeing unfold here is the exposure of the fundamental flaw in any debt-based financial system. The Euro is a financial juggernaut, and an OXI vote threatens the stability of the union as a whole. Many believe that we'll see nation after nation (of the EU countries) have similar problems, so how this gets handled is a bellwether.

Yes. Using Mycelium you have control over your own keys, and the backups follow open standards, so that even if the software goes out of production, you can still restore your wallet.
On coinbase, your coins are accessible at the whim of coinbase staff.

As you can probably tell from the chart, this article doesn't exactly discuss what I was getting at. It's extremely strange that Bitcoin is going up with increasing volume on a weekend. It seems China's ban has already become irrelevant. It may not have been the 2013 incident but I remember some price action like this where the price began ascending during a weekend as China's fallout progressed and then pumped as the week started. Anybody else remember this?

What opponent could be 'harder' than a bank with nearly unlimited funding?
I'm guessing your argument is that Bitcoin will forever need to "defend its title." This is simply untrue.
In order for any other currency to supplant BTC, it must have a feature with the following characteristics:
1) Feature is worth adopting
2) Feature is open source.
3) Feature is not integrated into Bitcoin.
If the feature is either worthless or closed source, it won't gain support. If it's open source and in demand, the feature will be rolled into Bitcoin.
