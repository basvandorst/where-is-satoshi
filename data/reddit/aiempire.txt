If you are buying some every week it will average out your cost, which is good. That being said, don't invest more than you wouldn't mind dropping down the drain as it were.

Interesting article thanks. With regards to why they are so hostile towards btc, I think it's a mixture of the banks not understanding it as well as the punitive anti money laundering regs they have to abide by.

I don't get this meme.

I sold some headphones for about 100btc in 2011 sometime (back when it was like $1) and sold them when they hit an 'all time high' of about $30, because I was a student and needed the money. Though I do think 'what if I had kept them' would have had $100k / £75k odd. Hindsight is a bitch. Still can't be worse than the guy who bought a Pizza for hundreds of coins lol.

Dollar cost average by buying what you can afford to lose every week. Really? Unless you are buying a decent chunk of BTC the fees will eat you up.

Lol. That was the whole point of btc in the beginning (fast cheap and secure transactions). 
Then we were told it wasn't for low value transactions. Then we were told it wasn't a currency at all but an 'asset class' not intended to be used as a currency. 
Yes it was and to say otherwise shows either you haven't been around since the early days or have amazing levels of cognitive dissonance.

Way ahead of ya. I sent my small holding of 0.55 to Kraken and sold at a nice profit (around 100%). Cost me $4.50 and a twelve hour wait for the privilege. 
Looking at coincap.io the average fee went up to about $20 at one point, crazy.

Just think of how rich Satoshi must be.

"Could care less"
Why do people keep doing this?
