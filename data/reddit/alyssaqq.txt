Yet Paypal bans my account and freezes my funds for 180 days for selling cryptocurrency on Ebay!

Paypal seller protection would cover a item with tracking  Sadly it does not cover digital sales:*(

rules? I see bitcoin selling on ebay, and bought my bitcoin with paypal. This is why I posted this:P I have never been scammed before so didnt think I needed to read every TOS or do background checks. I didnt blame bitcoin. I said I was never buying again, since you cant sell without jumping thru hoops:P

I use this site. Never had any problems, takes around 5 min for wallet transfer. Also accepts over 300 kinds of payment! Just make sure you read reviews of sellers before buying. Be careful if you sell bitcoins tho. Scammers everywhere:(
