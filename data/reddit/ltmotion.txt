Good on you, spend and replace is good.

I have had this with a South African payment provider who accepts BTC, Payfast. Basically your tx needs to clear next block and it has a 10 minute timer. If a block is slow to get mined you can end up getting it rejected on the site but the btc payment going through obviously.
Go check what payment processor is doing the BTC transaction for you and check if they credited your account with the equivalent value in Fiat. In my case my payfast account was credited and I could pay for my stuff from there.

If you are buying at a big exchange like binance or coinbase, I would suggest just keeping it there, but get a hardware wallet as soon as you can! If the price of a ledger nano S is even half of your first purchase, I would say just get the hardware wallet now and get it done. 
The odds of your PC or phone having some virus on or getting hacked is much higher than the exchange getting hacked or exit scamming all its customers.  Software wallets can be secure, but only if you use them right and are quite knowledgeable on security and bitcoin. Hardware wallets are always super secure and user friendly.
Lastly, since you are new, don't ever send BTC to anyone for an "investment" or anything, this field is regrettably full of scammers.  Don't trust anyone who DM's you on twitter or telegram.
Some cool channels to check out on youtube are "aantonop" and "IvanOnTech".  You will quickly learn a lot about everything watching these.

Just buy some amount that you can afford to lose every month, be that $10 or $1000, store your own coins and wait. 
This is not rocket science.

If you are going to be buying small amounts, make sure you check out the withdrawl fees of all the exchanges you have access to. Those fees can sometimes be quite a lot. I myself only buy like $100-200 per month. But give it 2 or 3 years and itl add up.  
Also, don't go speculating on shitcoins or leverage trading with all your money, using 5% or so for that is fine, never ever any more of that. 80% of it should be in BTC, maybe ETH. Slow and steady wins the race.

I sent a transaction yesterday at 1 sat/byte.. sure it took 7 hours, but who cares.. I can still move money very cheaply on BTC.

Pizza  and coffee - cant get that for BTC in South Africa (as far as I know). Our local "Amazon" TakeAlot, takes BTC at least via one of their payment providers :)
