Why does GDAX keep resetting their chart? What consequence does that have?

And I'm still waiting here for my bank to finalize a deposit onto Coinbase, lol. I want to get in on this. I believe in BTC.

What are you showing here? Once you input a dollar amount, the buy button should stop being greyed out.

Please check out [the Project for Awesome]( Every year, people from the community create videos advocating for their favorite charity, and the community votes on how to allocate the money. Definitely check out their website; you could offer matching donations.
Edit: Also, it would offer fantastic exposure for BTC.

If my coins are on GDAX, should I withdraw to a SegWit wallet at this time, or should I wait for GDAX to enable SegWit?
Edit: I'm a noob, so please excuse me. I think I was told there are no fees to pull from GDAX onto a wallet. If that's correct, than the better question is, if I pull to a SegWit wallet (like Eletrum or hardware) and hold, can I expect innovations to come along, like wide SegWit and LN adoption, that will make negligible the tx fees it takes to send those coins out of my wallet? If I pull from GDAX, I just have to be patient, right?

Is insider trading an applicable concept with Coinbase and the BCash people?

Adding "blockchain" to anything really does triple its value.
