We will report on client satisfaction in the next [blog post]( but it's a difficult issue. Despite best efforts, there are always some people who are going to have difficult issues that take a while to resolve, and some people flat out won't believe our statistics. Still, something is better than nothing!

Mr_E Thanks for all the feedback!  I hear you loud and clear and we will be working to improve all of this. We're starting to move faster but it's not necessarily as fast as we all would like.

For the record, the meeting was held by the Canadian Senate Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee.
Those who participated included: BitAccess ATM co-founder Haseeb Awan, CaVirtex CEO Joseph David, CaVirtex advisor Larry O'Brien, and Kyle Kemper and Victoria van Eyk of the Bitcoin Strategy Group.
You can view the complete video here:

PSP, i'm doing this because it needs to be done.  I'm coming from the outside getting real feedback and participating in making this a better company so that shareholders shares go up in value.  The notion that this company should be paying dividends is absurd.  If I was around then I would have voiced my opinion but hindsight is 20-20.

Thank you for the feedback, lestatistician. You make some good points!
With regards to support, we almost always get back to people within 24 hours now, and as always, we have our phone line which is manned during Canadian business hours. We are trying to talk with the community more (like now!), so I hope your opinion of our communication improves with time.
Your opinion of Joseph may partially be due to context. Remember that Joseph has effectively brought CAVIRTEX from its infancy to where it is today; there have been bank shutdowns and legal threats at every corner, and Joseph has, by and large, been the one to keep the company alive. Personal opinions aside, he's a tenacious guy - a very valuable asset in this industry!
As you say, CAVIRTEX is part of the 'old guard', but we also want to move forward. As our company grows, it has changed. We have a much larger team, and are committed to being at the forefront of Bitcoin Exchange development. We may not be there right now, but we're moving in the right direction.
@_date: 2014-06-05 18:14:26
We recognize that the fee structure was out of whack for a long time - it made sense when BTC was $25, and getting down to 0.5% fees via volume discounts wasn't very hard. The new fees have been a long time coming.
However, we also realize that our business has to be sustainable, and free transactions are not. It does cost money to keep our CS staff working and our developers coding, so I hope you find the new 0.75% rate reasonable.

Our UI will get a complete do-over with the new site.

Joseph's previous business suffered greatly from chargeback issues so that was one of the sticky things that resonated with him.

Nomopomo i was on that panel and Victoria and I both knew that these comments would not sit will with everyone.  My strategy was to keep it strictly to education and leave the regulation for a later date. I think the "treat it as FOREX" suggestion was a good one. You've also got to think of it from Joseph position, if anyone can start an exchange and they screw of the little guy it looks bad on us.  Frankly one of the only area's they can regulate is the fiat gateway so we need to co-operate.  We are working towards a Bitcoin future; it's better that we were there than not IMO. This is good discussion though.  Thanks for the feedback.

CaVirtex is the oldest and largest Bitcoin exchange in Canada. Getting to this position has not been easy. We have learned some hard lessons along the way. Those lessons are reflected in our operational policies.
At the present time, we only service Canadian citizens, residents and corporations. This is very clearly stated in bold red text on our deposit Bitcoin page.
If a current or potential customer does not agree with our policies, we would encourage them to try another exchange.
In the end, it comes down to safety and security, and this is something we simply cannot compromise on.

We aren't trying to hide fees, BangAz. The inactivity fee rollout was (as previously stated) not well done, and we refunded a considerable amount of fees because of that. Our fees are lower than many exchanges at this point.
Remember that CAVIRTEX is more than just one person - we're a team, with 25 employees doing our best to improve BTC services in Canada. Our three years of service is testament to our commitment to make things work for everyone.

@_date: 2014-06-05 21:31:48
Glad to have you with us, TheGent. Lower fees have been (not surprisingly!) an oft-requested change. The interface, including most of your suggestions, will be totally redone with the new site. We still aren't sure about having a troll-box - we're worried it'll just be used by spammers and people trying to trick new clients into doing something dangerous.
We aren't planning to drop the inactivity fee, although as stated we'll be sure to give a *lot* of warning before anything happens. No one should leave their coins on an exchange for a whole year - it's just a bad practice. To answer your question, the fees stop when the balance hits zero, so it shouldn't matter if you forget about a tiny amount of BTC or CAD on an old account.

It is a little disturbing seeing so many innocuous comments being downvoted into oblivion. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:57:21
DrX you bring up some important issues that i'll attempt to address.
1)Fake name: The reason for this is personal security and the notion that using social engineering our service could be compromised.  This policy has in fact prevented an attack last fall. Personally, I believe in honesty and transparency and don't mind my name being out in the open but I do not have any access to private keys.  Some people have different view  on privacy and the use of fake names makes them feel more secure. I'm sure Satoshi understands. 
2)CAVIRTEX is located across Canada. We have no official office that employee's drive to each morning.  We do however use some incredible technologies to securely co-ordinate our efforts.  There are definitely some drawbacks but overall I think it's actually pretty amazing. 
3) We have an HR consultant, we do the appropriate security checks, communications happen over secure VPN access, there are hierarchy's of access and control.  This is something we take vary seriously.
4) I wasn't involved with the FINTRAC process but it was handled with our compliance officers and legal teams advice.  
Considering most companies operate like it's the 70's i feel like we more than others operate like it's 2014 but we need to up our game in certain area's. 
Hope this answers your questions. Thanks for the feedback.

Sure - it was pretty strange turn of events, and a really bad case of miscommunication. 
We helped spruce up the subreddit (CSS work, pruned ancient posts, etc.) and asked if we could use it as an official subreddit for tech support and CS. Keyword there is asked; we didn't demand it for ourselves, and after the initial furor and us made up. 
The alternative, which is what is going on now, is that the subreddit is just a community-run subreddit - no CAVIRTEX mods. We're fine with that too.

Thank you for calling us. We have been fully aware of this phishing campaign. We released a statement about this earlier today:
Due to a compromise with one of our old third-party mass email providers, email addresses for some CAVirtEx users have been added to a phishing campaign to steal bitcoin, litecoins and other crypto currencies.
Attachments sent to some users include an 'Invoice' containing Java malware that will install a persistent RAT on your system. As always, please take care in opening attachments. Change your email address with CAVirtEx if necessary.
We have conducted an investigation and have concluded that the breach was due to the mass emailer and not our database.

Yes, of course, customers can register themselves. However, say you have a blog or a website that generates traffic. As a CaVrtex affiliate, you can put CaVirtex banners and tracking links on your site. This way, if someone clicks on your tracking link and signs up at CaVirtex, you would receive credit for that sign up and would share revenue on that customer's trading fees.

At CaVirtex, we welcome competition and expect LibertyBit will resume operations in the future.
In the meantime, CaVirtex continues to work hard to provide Canadians with a safe, secure and reliable Bitcoin exchange.
Our fees reflect the value of service we provide and the legal realities of keeping funds in Canadian banks with an Alberta corporation.
 
We operate our exchange with a team of dedicated full-time people. We also have a business plan that will add many more features to our exchange (you can view it in our prospectus on havelockinvestments.com). 
On the legal and regulatory front, we are paying for legal advice on how to operate in Canada with the utmost safety to customer funds.
Our legal team is also working hard to increase the number of fund transfer options for Canadians.

As TKRSRY said, CaVirtex will not be listed in your bank's list of payees. To learn how to make a Bill Payment deposit, please login to your CaVirtex account, go to the Deposit CAD page, enter an amount and select "Bill Pay Notice" from the dropdown, then click Deposit. You will then see detailed payee information and instructions. (Note: You must be a verified Virtex user in order to use this deposit method.)

Details will be publicly available very soon, as in next week.  I know we've said that once or twice, but it's for real this time!

Hi shwag. Could you please explain what problems you were having? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:56:05
PM me here and I'll see what I can do for you.
We receive 50-100 new account signups per day, we will get to everyone!

Hey cody. I'm one of the bunch.

On the legal and regulatory front, we are paying for legal advice on how to operate in Canada with the utmost safety to customer funds.
You will find that other smaller competing exchanges that offer low fees may not have a full-time team, a publicly-viewable business plan or any legal or regulatory efforts underway.  
(Note: With enough trading volume you can reduce fees to 0.5%.)

We're still open for business. Verified customers can deposit CAD to CaVirtex via bill payment and direct withdrawal. We will also have alternative cash deposit methods available very soon.
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:06:14
Thanks Piper67. Verified CaVirtex customers can still deposit via bill payment and direct withdrawal from their bank accounts. It's only the cash deposit option through BMO that is no longer available. This was not an entirely unanticipated development based on similar actions taken by Canada's other chartered banks. Hence, we have been working on contingency plans for alternate cash deposit methods over the past few weeks. We're hoping to have something in place soon.

At the present time, we are encouraging traders to use online bill payment to fund their accounts. It's fast, efficient, safe and inexpensive. Nevertheless, if you would like to inquire about bank wires for amounts less than $10,000, please submit a support ticket:  In terms of Litecoin, our exchange software is capable of handling other digital currencies like LTC, and we are still interested in offering this service. It's something we're hoping to offer in the near future. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:05:10
Wish I could be there. Hope it's a success.

Thanks BlackLilac!  BTW, if you know someone, refer them, and they get hired, I'll give you 2 bitcoins!

We have not received reports of this issue from any of our other customers. If you are still experiencing this issue, please submit a support ticket at  or call (888) 812-2525. Thank you.

Fees are not charged on unfilled orders. Fees are held in escrow on unfilled orders. If an order is cancelled, the fees are returned.

In the following YouTube video, Virtex CEO Joseph David explains how Virtex customers can get their debit card. (Be sure to watch until the very end so you can save yourself a little CAD.)
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:22:23
I have spoken with my colleague about your account and everything appears to have been resolved. If you have any problems in the future please feel free to call us or submit a support ticket: 
@_date: 2013-06-18 20:12:29
All Canadians, no matter who they bank with, are still able to purchase bitcoins from VirtEx.  While there is now one less option of funding your account, you're still able to make use of the online bill payment option, as well as the direct debit option.  
Both remaining deposits methods require verification, but stay tuned because pretty soon we'll be announcing new cash deposit methods for unverified customers (with limits in place for regulatory compliance).

We're sorry you're not satisfied with CaVirtex. We are constantly working hard to improve our service. That said, we do periodically hit road bumps which cause delays and sudden changes. As we hope you can appreciate, running a Bitcoin exchange is very challenging due to a variety of factors, particularly the traditional financial system which is not especially fond of Bitcoin at the present time. In addition to negotiating with skittish bankers and processors, we also have to combat fraudsters, which are lurking in the shadows. Despite those challenges, we are committed to providing Canadians with a safe, secure and reliable Bitcoin exchange where they can trade with Canadian dollars. In terms of Vogogo, they are a trustworthy partner that has had the courage to work with us (and Canadian Bitcoin traders), while most others have turned their backs. If you would like to provide any feedback about CaVirtex, we encourage you to submit a support ticket:  Thanks for your understanding.

Hi there, my name is Jack and I represent CaVirtex. I will be connecting with the Bitcoin community here on as well as bitcointalk. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding CaVirtex. As for your concerns paddywhack, I can assure you that we do not have any liquidity issues. Rather, it's a matter of ramping up our customer service resources to accommodate our rapid growth. Thanks for your understanding.

_Mr_E is right. We are aware of the issue and are hoping it will be resolved soon.

The cash deposit situation has changed since OP last traded.  These days, MoneyMart is proving to be the best option for cash.  We can also accept online bill payments and EFTs from any financial institution in Canada.  
We'll be implementing new deposit methods that will speed up the process, but for now, verified customers can get funds into VirtEx in 2-5 business days.
@_date: 2013-06-18 20:17:29
VirtEx here, just as an FYI, keep an eye out for an announcement from us regarding new cash deposit methods we've been finalizing in anticipation of this event!  
@_date: 2013-08-09 14:12:04
You got it.  
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:50:46
PM us,  we can make that happen for you.

Please note the following article in Virtex's Terms of Use, which have been in place since July 1, 2011 when Virtex was first launched (
ARTICLE 13 - DORMANT ACCOUNTS
13.1 If you have not executed a trade with your VirtEx account for more than 1 year your account will be considered inactive. VirtEx will charge an inactivity fee of $50 per month up until such a time when the account balance reaches zero. BTC balances will be converted to CAD to pay for this fee, as required.
The terms, including Article 13, are agreed upon signup: 
Up until now, Virtex has not acted upon this article. However, we have become increasingly concerned about the use of Virtex as a long-term storage facility for Bitcoin by some of our traders.
Although we go to great lengths to safely store and secure our customers' funds, Virtex is a platform primarily geared for the exchange of Bitcoin. It was never our intention to be a wallet service.
While we sympathize with the displeasure expressed by some of the posters, we hope that you can understand our perspective.
