I bought with my mastercard

Only if you have a visa card, My bank only issues mastercard as such it generally takes me 5 days to get my funds, so this is awesome to me.

lol well at this point I already have $80.00 worth. When I can afford it I'll increase my bi-weekly purchase.

I just want it to raise up enough that my $10.00 purchase every two weeks makes me a bit of extra cash....

Hey thanks for posting this, I shared it with some of my friends and family who are't redditors. :)

Automated buys &amp; sells would be great too. I currently use coinbase to automatically purchase bitcoin the day after payday. However it means waiting for 6 days (4 business days and 2 non-business days) before I actually have access to it. It would be nice if I could do this with circle and not have the waiting period.

While I agree about the incentive part, I think we do need easier ways to obtain it.

The difference for me is on coinbase, I have a waiting period between the time I purchase and when I can actually use my bitcoin. My bank only issues MasterCard. You can only instant buy on Coinbase if you have a Visa card. Because I don't have one, When I buy on Wednesday (which is my normal day to buy) my bitcoin isn't in my account until the following Tuesday. On circle I can buy bitcoin and instantly have access to it.

First off, the word again, says you think I've posted to you before... I haven't. In fact that was my first and only post in this entire thread.
Secondly I didn't tell you what to do, I simply stated that if you really wish to win against piracy you should find a business model that works. If you would rather argue here on a thread with me and others then by all means go right ahead. If you want to continue to try to fight piracy the way you have been, then go right ahead. You're free to do as you wish. My Point was that it doesn't matter what you do, piracy will continue to exist whether you like it or not and whether it pisses you off or not.
I'm not even going to validate your straw-man by addressing it.

Honestly you can be all the upset you want, but ranting about it here, or any place else isn't going to change the fact, that the moment kat went down people who used it simply went else where. It's a losing game. Sure occasionally big sites will go down and someone somewhere will have to suffer some consequences. But while that's going on, there are 50 other people popping up to take his/her place, and the people who want to share will always find a way to do so.
If you want to win against piracy, find a good business model and use it, because piracy has always existed in some form and I'm pretty sure it always will.
