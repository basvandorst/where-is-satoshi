Actually reading the documents on SEC.gov
"Each Share comprising the initial Baskets of Shares (the “Seed Baskets”) represents [0.01] bitcoin and is offered at a per Share price equal to the price of [0.01] bitcoin." 
The ETF is registering 10mm shares. Which is 100,000 bitlycoins.

this is one of the stupider comments I've seen in a bitcoin thread and that is saying a lot. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:18:56
lol this is so dumb it hurts to read. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:35:54
but the point being that merchants ie one of the base layers of the bitcoin ecosystem often don't have the option to be agnostic to confirmation times and their transactions are significantly bigger and more complex than someone who is sending $15 to a friend. So ... not sure what your point is...

lol yeah, someone is stuck 10-15 years behind on CD rates bro. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:12:08
depends on the transaction amount. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:47:41
but they charge the merchants on the backend which gets built into the price you pay for goods...

ya dood, $12 to $200 is a national travesty. somebody call the profit police. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:41:37
credit and debit cards charge fees. you just don't see them as the consumer. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:46:31
bitcoin has no yield bro. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:47:50
negative real rates?

I don't think you understand how the world / currencies actually work.
