Yeah I haven't had a ticket go more than 24 hours without a response at bitstamp. Only thing is I'm not sure if it's an off ramp and can get USD out. Amazing place though to buy and trade, and move coin out to my ledger.

one more thing to add to what you said, it is also easier for them to seize assets if it is in USD. becomes quite harder to seize bitcoin if you are smart.

Here is a thread that could answer some questions you may have. But basically, imagine you holding cash in hand vs a bank holding your cash for you. Coinbase has control vs you. If you move to your wallet before moving to a gambling site, coinbase can't ban you because of the extra hop. Imagine say, your bank banning you and transfers to a local casino. To avoid this, simply pulling the money out yourself then depositing at the casino.
