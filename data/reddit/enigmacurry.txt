How high of a fee you need to include in your transaction in order for it to be included in the blockchain within X number of blocks. This chart shows that on average, you need a 0.002btc fee in order to have your payment confirmed within 10 minutes, which is 20 times higher than my mycelium wallet is set for (0.0001 btc)

No. I agree regular signed bitcoin transactions are not escrow. That's just sending someone money and hoping for the best. Kickstarter is a minimal form of escrow because they are an independent trusted intermediary between you and someone else that disburses your funds based on a contract (they don't get your dollars until they raise X total dollars.) It fits the definition of escrow perfectly.
I do think multisig offers way more possibilities, however, and is likely the way forward.

That's not true. It already is stored on your computer (In electrum, go to Wallet-&gt;seed, to see for yourself), and as long as you're using a decent passphrase, it's stored securely.

Last time I tried setting up my own diaspora server it was practically impossible for me to see posts from people using other servers. You could add people on a per-user basis, but it was impossible for me to see all  posts on my server, and no one else could see my own  posts. From my perspective, Diaspora *is* a centralized service (albeit open source that anyone can run)  with limited ability to talk to certain other people on other servers, not much better than email.
Totally willing to be proven wrong. If there's a guide to setup a fully federated diaspora server such that I can see all  posts from any server worldwide, then great, I just don't think it exists.

You have that same problem with any op_return transaction today. Perhaps the client doesn't need to care, and it is just a service the miners provide? It could be done completely outside the blockchain as an alternative, we would just need to standardize something.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:30:05
Yes, the revocation would be in the blockchain, but pruneable. Newly mined blocks that contain transactions to addresses that have been revoked would not confirm (after some time) as well that clients would not rebroadcast transactions to known revoked addresses. I guess there is a mempool/revoke-list resource cost to the client, so perhaps there must be a high fee attached to such a revocation.

 - These guys are keeping a database of all the OP_RETURN transactions. 
Take a look at any of those transactions, from blockchain.info click the "Show scripts and coinbase" link. That info that appears at the bottom of the screen is encoded into the transaction and will appear in the blockchain of full nodes. That OP_RETURN is the indicator that the output is unspendable. You don't need to have a special address, this is the blockchain way of marking a UTXO that cannot, by definition, be spent.
Now, usually these OP_RETURN transactions are sending 0 BTC, because people use it to encode data, not to burn coins, but you can attach coins to the OP_RETURN as well, and that makes the coins unspendable.

You're 100% correct. The recipient does need to worry about it before confirmation. I was merely talking about the brilliancy of bitcoin that is block confirmation.
In my world at least, I rarely care about the speed of confirmation. If I make a purchase at newegg, I don't care if I have to wait 6 confirmations, it's not going to make a dent in the time it takes to ship my package to me. What I do care about, is owning my own money, being able to prove that I have it, and prove that I sent it, without trusted third parties. Bitcoin does that, and I thought that OPs transaction exemplified this global consensus pattern quite well.
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:52:01
You make a good point, but at least we've narrowed down the attack surface. To double spend, you have to control a very large amount of hashrate. The first few times work great, but word gets around that this is happening, and the hashrate moves to another pool.

The video didn't explain symmetric encryption, it explained a process for sharing a key in order to perform symmetric encryption at a later time.
In other words, the process shown in the video would give both parties the single key to do symmetric encryption as many times as they wanted, both of them using the same key for encryption/decryption from that point onward.

For long term storage (where you have no regular need to transfer coins out of the address) you do something similar: just bootup the ubuntu live cd (which doesn't use your hard drive) open up your offline copy of bitaddress.org, go to the brain wallet tab, enter a password you won't forget, get the public key, transfer coins to said address.

In my opinion, the official bitcoin client is a bit too problematic for people new to bitcoin for exactly the reasons you outlined.
I recommend you use [Electrum]( When you first start the client it will generate addresses for you and will give you a mnemonic phrase that you can use to regenerate those addresses on any computer. Write that mnemonic down in a safe/encrypted place. Electrum doesn't store a copy of the blockchain locally either, so it's quick to start up and use on as many computers as you like.

Manipulation is one thing, but for bitcoin to cease to be money is basically impossible. They can't buy every bitcoin, and they can't hold onto the ones they have forever. Even if they tried to not spend these bitcoins, the value of the ones they didn't buy would just increase in value. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, so they can't prevent other people from spending bitcoins they don't control.

You don't hear a lot of complaints from the electrum team about having to deal with a 'flood [of] errors'.
You currently have the best android bitcoin client, making it open source will solidify that position.

The dissonance of the Mises institute on this issue is amazing.

Key pillar of this (and other mises) articles: Bitcoin cannot be money, because Bitcoin **objectively** works the way we say it does and no one will use it any other fashion.

It should get rolled into a block eventually. Theoretically, if you didn't want to wait for that, you could just double spend the coins (same inputs, or just empty out the entire address) this time with a tx fee.

There's actually 12 BTC in that picture (wow, all 12 of those coins cost me less than one today!), I tried to predict which of the people I gave it to would appreciate it the most, but actually that mostly proved incorrect. It's really hard actually to convince people about these things. Although all of them have mentioned that they are grateful today of the gift (one of them called it "the Christmas gift that keeps on giving!"), I don't think any of them have bought any themselves. The whole "I missed the boat" phenomenon is hard to get over for some people. They're all just hanging onto these cards, afaik. I've told my Dad to buy some a total of three times over the course of the last year, at $8, at $15, and at $100. Each time he kicked himself for not buying before, but I don't think he really gets that he can still be a part of this thing.

'Legal' is not a term you even use in a free society. 'Legal' means regulated by an authority by making a law about it. Things are naturally free, they may be good or bad, but they are not illegal/legal until someone comes in to the picture laying down The Law. In general, this is a form of aggression against the free society.
The only society wherein everything is legal until it becomes illegal is a completely authoritarian state.

Your questions are good ones. The question really does come down to "who legitimately owns the house?"
What argument can be made that the government owns the house I live in (let alone every other house in America?) 
I can make a pretty good counter-argument that I own my house, not anyone else: I didn't just find a house, owned by the government, and take up residence in it. I worked hard, exchanging my labor for money that I used to purchase a house built by a man that worked hard with his own hands and raw materials. The house didn't exist before he made it, and no government official ever showed up to help construct the house. No tax imposed on the house is legitimate, because no else can legitimately lay claim to it. You can make any argument you like about the need for societies to have roads, social programs, even national defense, but what does my house, *that you don't own*, have to do with it?

There is no such thing as objective value. I can subjectively value something for it's intrinsic values.
Example: I value water for it's intrinsic value of hydration. I value USD for it's **extrinsic**  value that it can be used to get other things that I want. Water also has extrinsic value when you use it to create electricity. Bitcoin, arguably, has both intrinsic and extrinsic value, both of which are subjective.

If you actually value BTC more than an item for sale, why would you use ANY other currency to buy that item, when you could just use that currency to buy more BTC? It's because as a human you have many desires, and you do value cheeseburgers more than BTC at some price point.
Take the dollars you would have spent on amazon, buy BTC. Use that BTC to buy things at a store that takes BTC. Since you only used the dollars you would have used anyway, you're not out anything.
(Yes, there's a lag effect in your ability to buy BTC due to bank transfers and whatnot, but if you're doing this on a regular basis (converting USD to BTC) this is not a problem. Yes, there are fees when you convert currencies, but there's also discounts to be had for using deflationary currency.)

So why does [this FAQ entry]( mention 2,099,999,997,690,000 satoshis? Where are the missing 2.31E6 satoshi?

The transaction id is decided on the client before you ever click send. It's a hash of the signed message that says "I have X coins in addr Y and I'm sending them to addr Z". The way the math works out, the end user can never choose what the transaction ID looks like (it's a hash of all the variables in the transaction itself.) That message goes through the bitcoin network which SD picks up, they take the transaction ID and generate their lucky number, and determine a win/lose, and send back coins to you in a matter of seconds, it won't be for another 10 mins or so that any of that reaches the actual blockchain.
SD says their lucky number algorithm is: hmac_sha512(secert,txid:out_idx). So, in order for SD to make it look like someone won, all they have to do is generate lots of transactions that they don't broadcast (creating lots of txid:out_idx), use their secret in the algorithm, until they have a winner. Broadcast that transaction, and they only pay fees one time.

Pretty much inevitable. We've already [surpassed their market cap.](
