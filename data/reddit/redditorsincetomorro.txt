The .1BTC on there is the test, and the 2btc transaction was a separate transaction from another wallet. There was a 2btc transaction that should have been there before the .1btc

People using a raspberry pi based system, or something with very low RAM are unable to run a full node. So the next best option is to run on another small peer's node. I doubt one node in the P2Pool system could even get a significant portion of the network's mining power.

Put a good mining client on the steam Free to Play section. I bet as a community we could greenlight it. But we would need a well put together mining client, preferably using P2pool.

How hard would it be to implement an open source decentralized forum using a .bit domain? It seems like that's what we should be using instead of this moderated crap.

If only blockbuster had started accepting bitcoin before they went under. It's a interesting trend that falling companies are looking at bitcoin as just a huge marketing gimmick. I like that they're looking into it, but that's just my two cents.
@_date: 2014-05-20 09:43:58
Is it possible that my wallet only contained 1 btc to begin with, so the 2btc transaction was not valid? Then when I reset the blockchain, the misbalance corrected itself in the balance display?
@_date: 2014-05-20 09:54:36
I posted the receiving wallet. There should be a 2btc transaction, then a .1btc transaction then another 2btc transaction. The first transaction never appeared.

The larger the value gets, the less of a % the fluctuation becomes. This $500 recent crash was only 40% and it recovered in a few days. Compare this to every other crash and we see that the $ amount may be higher in the crash, but it's less of a % of the total previous value.

In an effort to actually pay my taxes and not be in bad standing the the Gov/IRS, what is the cheapest way to self claim profits made by buying for instance a bitcoin at $100 then selling at $150. Should I file the $50 as "other income" or what is this long-term capital gains thing you speak of?

ASICs are still able to be profitable if ordered now so long as you have a good hash/J ratio like with [KNC] ( as per

Bullshit, if IBM wanted to start solely making asics just to fuck with bitcoin (they wouldn't because it wouldn't be profitable in the long run) they could easily crank out &gt;51% of the current computing power in months.

I think the best thing that we could do as a society is to publish scientific research on the blockchain. The idea of peer review is already there in academia, I think this will be the major advance of 2014. Imagine all the current knowledge available to everyone without a centralized issuer of this information. It's beautiful!

How did it go?

I think we should continue to adjust it to about the price of the current penny. It seems like the most fair way to provide just enough incentive to encourage people to keep mining when the coins/block go lower and the number of transactions go higher.

Wow, this is amazing, especially when we were all really excited about that $600 Seans Outpost got! I think we need another one of [these] ( threads, unless you already have everything figured out.

Not all altcoins are pump and dump schemes per se*. Many people may be trying to pump and dump, but it really comes down to if they have any significant advantage (like NMC) compared to bitcoin, where their value is justified. I'm sorry if this comes off as a namecoin promo, but I'm just using it as an example.

It's just one guy that is sour about it. I think most of us would prefer to pay for things with bitcoin as opposed to paypal or credit card, and it makes more sense for retailers to accept it as well (1% fee using coinbase as opposed to 3-5% with paypal/credit cards). So I support collective efforts to convince retailers to support a mutually beneficial currency.

I own a car, I was kinda trying to draw a parallel here, it's like this guy went up to some people that own cars and said "So explain to me why I, a non-driver, and non-enthusiast, should get a car?". He really could have phrased that a lot better if he wanted actual info ie. "What is the utility of Bitcoin and how could it have a major impact on exchanging goods and services?" Or they could take a look at the [FAQ]( and make a decision for themselves.
