Money can not make you happy but Bitcoin can, because it's for the people bye the people. Nobody controls Bitcoin that's why it's more fair and better. And yes I also pray, not to God but to Sastoshi. I pray: let the mempool be empty today dear Satoshi so I can make my transaction. And you know what, today he answered me! 
So don't focus on money because money is bad. Focus on Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin is so high, you can get so much money for your Bitcoin right now! That's what is important and that's why I hodl.

That's not true because Bitcoin is centralised and Jihan is in control. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:41:40
I agree, we need a PoW change as soon as possible. And to an algo that is 100% asics resistant so that the common man can mine Bitcoin again. Otherwise  Bitcoin will fail in the future because it will be controlled by Jihan Wu and his chinese miners friends. They control BTC and BCH, and have ASIC's for almost all the other coins. I can't believe they got so strong and big and rich simply by building ASIC's and then also delivering to people. That was totally uncalled for.  Maybe if we crash the market we can get rid of Jihan.

Dash stopped working, it's completely unusable right now. And nobody is using it anyways. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:34:06
Me to, I can't afford an ASIC but now Bitcoin is finally also for me. With LN I will be able to start saving up money for my lambo! This is amazing news! And if you are lucky and your node becomes an important node for a well used route you can charge higher fees and make even more money!

I don't think there are enough Bitcoin accepting merchants (that don't use a payment provider) for there to be relevant data on this.
What wallets have this turned off? I know bitcoin-qt has in on by default since version 0.16. Do most wallets even have an option? I know electrum has, do other wallets as well? 
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:36:33
Yeah we the common man stood up against our chinese oppressors and we have a 100% victory. If you want to laugh to look at the state of bcash. The blocks are empty 100% of the time.

Perfect use case for cointext, send and receive coins over txt messages. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:35:28
No, everybody knows Ethereum is a pre mine scam. Only LN and Bitcoin and possibly litecoin are legit. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:37:04
Google Dash attack or try and look for the dash wallet software. It does not never exist. Only Bitcoin has secure software, the rest is a scam.

I gave 11 bitcoins away on a internet forum when they had this price, after the drop from a 100 USD. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:40:18
Is this needed before you can buy Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:10:26
Truth is not always best. Sometimes it's in the best interest of the system to lie.

Discipline Andreas for Second Satoshi! He Who Is Hodly.  
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:04:43
A true hodler never exchanges his Bitcoin's for shitcoins so they would never ever use shapeshift in the first place.
If you use shapeshift you are a traitor to Bitcoin and when your shitcoin plummets you will get the punishment you deserve for your threatury.

Then move to a different sub.

Shame on you, taking advantage of other people's misery.

The app that will kill Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:11:12
Lightning Network dude, LN is pure P2P. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:52:04
When Bitcoin goes above 50 000 USD nobody will want to sell their Bitcoin to the price won't be able to drop anymore, only go up when people buy. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:51:21
I agree, banks going down, the dollar losing all value. It's the best thing that will ever happen to the world. It will make the world a better place when that scam collapses and people will finally be free instead of being slaves. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:10:05
There are plenty and they work really great. Once you have bought Bitcoin with fiat you can then send your Bitcoin to them in a decentralised manner so that you are in full control as long as the fees are low enough. And now that the attacks on Bitcoin have stopped fees will be low forever! 
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:49:24
None of the other coins are decentralised only Bitcoin. Only Bitcoin is 100% secure.  Now some people might go for the cheap coins but when they get hacked they will regret and it and come crying back to master Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:13:43
That's why we need the Lightning Network. then we will have instant transactions and no fees and pure P2P. 
If transactions are not instant it's hard for use in commerce. If fees are high, well who wants to pay to pay? And using payment providers is no longer P2P.
LN is working great now and seeing more and more rapid exponential adoption. And then we will finally have what we always wanted: everybody else using Bitcoin and then our coins will go to the moon. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:09:05
Please don't promote coinex, they are a total scam and you should tell everybody that. If  tweets about them, that automatically means they are a scam. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:15:46
14 000 is WAY to low. Around Christmas we are going to hit 100 000 USD per coin, because LN adoption is going EXPONENTIAL. And then all other coins will die because LN is supperior.
