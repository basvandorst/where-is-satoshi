In few years this magic will come true. Ten we will see who was right and who wasn't.

With all the innovations that we are surrounded by, most of the people are still conservative and short-sighted. Bitcoin should grow up to 2k for them to notice it, and up to 3k to start implementing it.
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:41:32
This idea is really brillian, and it could be a first small step to involve people to cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:28:42
This is an interesting "what if". Right now this looks more like a conspiracy theory. Still it is not excluded. The most curious fact in world response to Bitcoin is that it literally equals to political position of country.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:56:51
Cool! We are witnessing how new economy is born, and this amazes. Not surprised Austria was the first country to create and implant this idea.
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:03:15
That's definitely a good decision, even if it doesn't work with bitcoins, you will save your health.
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:29:48
Makes sense. In regards bitcoins that a thing of future.

One day, when all money will stop it's existence in paper, this article's title will be a joke, and not even the funniest one.

Seems that none of us will be alive when Bitcoin will hit 100k USD. However, you can start you laughing plan right now.
@_date: 2017-09-21 10:38:46
I don't think it's gonna work, especially in Russia. Government won't let cryptocurrency stay in the country. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:42:04
Indeed, cryptocurrancy and ability to pay with bitcoins should start with Internet users, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safarim Facebook etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:28:04
It's probably about all the innovations in the world. People who don't understamd it or us too lazy to understand, will better deny it at all. And that's what happening now with bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:18:21
Another step to the future. During last couple days more and more Real Estate companies in various countries (USA, UAE, now Turkey) include Bitcoin as one of the payment sources
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:17:19
Bitcoin has a strong potential, but it will not destroy US Dollar. Dollar is considered as a main World Trade currency, and with the all growth pace and accessibility of Bitcoin, conservatism of global economic trends will leave Dollar at its place.

This photos just made my day. Never though about this comparison. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:16:45
This seems pretty familiar. China bans Google service, and creates their own search engine Baidu. China bans Facebook and creates their own social network Qzone. Next step - own internal cryptocurrency? And this won't even cause any surprise
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:24:28
And at the same time, The Head of Russian Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, compares Bitcoin with a financial pyramid in her official statement. The only hope is that this tender will not be sold and real economists will participate in this research. Btw, the tender price is a bit low for such an important issue.

We'll see a lot of hype when it'll reach 5k. At this point it just runs up with the speed of light and no one is amazed by that

This meme is very popular. And truly shows how all this bans look like. Thanks for refreshing it in our minds :)
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:28:27
Since all China bans, it is obvious that Bitcoin Traders are looking farther on east and move to more digitally progressive country - Japan.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:00:08
That's a very good question! But I'm not sure if we have an answer yet. Probably it shouldn't just disappear after you die. The question is only about the key if it changes or disappears.
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:31:26
No country should create its own cryptocurrency, because this destroys the decentralization idea of cryptocurrency. However, this is just an idea, and it looks the same as Estonian cryptocurrency project. So generally, Canada is not the first.

Not sure if it's necessary to open a Bitcoin Bank. But anyway that's a good beginning to involve more people to bitcoin system.

It is strange that Google hessitate to implant Bitcoin as complete deal. Google always postitioned itself as a company that goes with the times and often goes over the times.
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:35:34
This is amazing news. Every day Bitcoin is showing its potential and opportunities. However this is not the "first" issue of major purchase via Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:57:16
Bad idea, since different governments have various views of Bitcoin future. China bans it, Malta tries implementing it. Venezuela will force itself to be isolated from some economic routes, and will force herself another wave of crises
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:28:07
Great news. The fact that Japanese companies and Japan itself philanthropy Bitcoin strengthens the position of this country as futuristic.

@_date: 2017-09-20 10:40:55
This can probably couse the increase of interest to bitcoins. As we now China has the biggest population, so everything begins here.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:20:31
Generally all China actions are committed to stop its own people form keeping up with the times. This country did it for ages and for some reason they are still gaining success.

For sure Bitcoin will go through this hardfork. It is just another obstacle. I don't believe this source at all.
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:43:17
I'm not sure if your efforts will change a situation. People need something different, I mean when they will see that they can buy all the types of stuffs using bitcoins at that point they will get interestet, People like mainstream.

Maybe the next info will be useful, also:
"You will lose the copy of the private keys to addresses you've created or added but you won't destroy them. A backup will save it. You won't lose past transactions, those are stored by the network, not you: you will not lose ownership of any bitcoins you may have acquired under the private keys you backed up, generating a new one and not creating a backup may result in loss. The first 100 addresses will not need to know the address of a private key. Those are derived from the private key mathematically".
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:30:14
With all the hype around Bitcoin reaching 5k mark, more and more posts like this one appear. People remember all that "throw-in" about death of Bitcoin that were mistakenly predicted by some slacktivists and armchair warriors.

So this guy should be "whipping the cat" right now. By the way, "Go and get a job" nowadays sounds pretty funny, when you realize that more and more digital nomads appear. "The world is changing" (should be read with the voice of Technical Boy from American Gods series)

Bitcoins are polarized indeed. But criptocurrency is definitely going to change the world.

This should be done already. Blockchain is a prospective area for investment, and there are a lot of segments in Wall Street that can be improved.

I just teach myself put first that will make my day whatever happens after then. So, if I have a meditation first, then a cup of good coffee when I go through all my plans on this day, after that I can check out for other "important" things, like checking important emails, bitcoin price, etc. I know, it may sound like old-fashion lifestyle but I think that was our previous generation's the secret of their success.

If this will be done, it is going to be a huge step made by China. This country always bans services that can "destroy" the collective mind of China citizens, like Google, Facebook or YouTube. And these are the services that should be away from politics.

It is amazing to witness how Japan becomes Bitcoin paradise. More and more news about bitcoin acceptance in Japan appear every day, and this once again proves that Japan is a country moving forward with the slogan "Future is Now"

Japan has done a lot to become a leader in Bitcoin market, and with all the "futuristic" position of countries development, it is really good that specifically, Japan will be the leader.

@_date: 2017-10-04 07:08:51
This happened because Japan knows how to implement innovation to make future close as possible. And this relates not only Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. This country makes in in every single aspect of its life.

Don't think so. Your key is important, if you forget the key you will probably lose your money.

This is quite probable. Most likely we'll see Bitcoin price above 5k, but it still can rise up to 6k.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:16:00
This looks very cute and funny today. And the keyword here is "today". Seems that in a few years, we'll see the reversed video, with the same level of cuteness.

However this is the reality of China political views. They do wanna exclude Bitcoin from their country, in the same was as they did with Google service and Facebook. Just to create their own social networks and search engines. Probably they are planning to create their own cryptocurrency, since Blockchain development was mentioned in their latest 5 year plan (2016-2020)
