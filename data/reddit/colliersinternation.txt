A cold wallet, search bitfi on google and watch the bitfi videos on their website. It will explain all.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:59:02
Lol, who cares about a cold wallet for 20 bucks

Leverage trading is like going to the casino. Why should we help someone willing to go to the casino?

We know binance pumps their coins and burns them

Ok you made me feel bad��
I’ll admit I was wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:02:22
I use a bitfi

My rule of thumb. Keep track of price you bought bitcoin. Keep price you sold it into fiat. Tax those capital gains. You will be safe if you do this. Trust me. Forget the people telling you to tax every trade.

Wait six years and tell me again

I drive a Mitsubishi Mirage, and have zero car payments and moved back in with my dad for free rent. He understands, he wants me to stack more bitcoin��. And I’m 24, I’ve only been out of his house since 21.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:44:08
You can look at bitcoin charts on several sites to find your answer.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:45:03
Crash in July to 7k then back up to 20k.
I may be wrong but that is what I speculate.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:57:51
The safest bet is to buy no matter what until the 2020 halvening and then sell half of your gains when you feel ready... that could be 2021 or earlier but it all depends on your goals. Then put it into real estate because inflation will make real estate go up actually. Then hodl 40 percent and short the market with your remaining 10 percent when the bear market is confirmed.
This is one of many strategies.
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:48:32
January 1st 2021 I would predict 150k-250k.
It’s so hard to time these things though.
Although I have a good track record,
If you look at my post history you will see I called the bottom at 3000.
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:06:05
I’m saying that institutions are people like you and me,
Except they are actually more greedy then the average person (the reason people in charge of institutions are rich and powerful is because of greed). 
Saying why would institutions buy at this level is an arrogant statement...bitcoin is the perfect market for greedy people to push the price to the expected “new high”. 
The entire market is purely a game simply based off human psychology. If you can not see this there is no point in arguing with you.
The reason bitcoin will go to 1 million is because greedy people around the world will buy until it reaches that number. Could be 2 years, 5 or 10 but we will get there. Science proves it.
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:18:26
I respect your opinion man. We will see who is right over time but bitcoin has been more predictable over the years than you think and the psychology and past performance of the market does not back your theory. But I will say this... anything can happen in the bitcoin game....
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:33:06
If I had a gun to my head and a stranger said I will kill you at the end of 2020 if your not within 50k I would predict 200k.
That way I would be safe at 150-250k.
I personally believe that guess would give me the best chance to survive. This guess is purely off past performance and if the trend continues.
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:57:04
No shot buddy, the market is not designed to do what the majority thinks will happen. The majority of people still say bitcoin has no value and is going back below 3000... so it goes to 13k and we will never see 6k again. I would bet my car on it.
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:24:13
Unless you happened to buy back in at 3k. Then you can just chill And buy more in the upcoming months.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:51:21
Yes I plan on buying the rest of 2019. that is what I hope haha. Wishful thinking I guess.
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:30:39
Most likely a massive bull run followed by a massive sell off but the past may not  repeat itself like it has been, but that is the most likely scenario.
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:14:47
Of course we’re gonna see a 30 maybe 40 percent correction. 
We went up over 300 percent in a few months... but we’re not gonna see a 50 percent like you are preaching.
@_date: 2019-04-08 04:39:09
Your million dollar house would be worth 100 million.
It’s a catch 22!
Assets will rise
@_date: 2019-04-25 17:06:54
It sounds like an awesome idea
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:55:39
No problem brother. Or sister (we all assume it’s a dude on the other end). Guilty...
@_date: 2019-04-01 22:48:40
I have been thinking about this so much lately.
What if real estate skyrockets cause the dollar plunged?
Owning assets is the key then. 
Everyone saying the real estate market is at the top could be in for a catch-22.
Maybe that term has a secret meaning for 2022 lol. I just discovered my own conspiracy theory responding to your comment..... lol I need to get a life.
@_date: 2019-04-06 04:45:46
Doesn’t matter,
I see it as a store of value!
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:40:04
Oh crap I typed their instead of there.... and I forgot a comma and a question mark...... thank you so much for correcting me. I was really worried about my grammar over a reddit post. Maybe English is my second language? People have nothing better to do but leave negative comments. All I was doing was spreading positivity. Have a good day.

That’s what I think.... 
he happens to live 20 minutes away from me and I saw him eating dinner at a local restaurant once. I took it as a sign my theory is correct.
@_date: 2019-04-25 16:47:53
Is this a scam?
@_date: 2019-04-09 06:20:26
Yup and the cycle will continue until the world ends

What lead to your bad financial situation?
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:43:37
Even better������
@_date: 2019-04-27 05:25:06
Me too
@_date: 2019-04-25 00:24:32
How old are you? I’m sorry about your situation but you do realize you’re asking for someone to give you 10k?
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:06:55
I had to read this three times��
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:58:27
But stocks are worth way more than what the gdp shows. So buying companies right now seems a little shady. We are in a massive stock bubble
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:28:57
What about bitfi wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:11:02
Thanks for that perspective. The answer to that question in my opinion is no......
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:11:00
Obviously but no one is gonna all hold at the same time. There will still be transactions going. You are blind if you think everyone will stop at the same time.
You are not seeing my point, the congestion can be solved by using other cryptos, trading your bitcoin for other cryptos to buy your goods, using the lightning network, and believing in Bitcoins resiliency.
Did bitcoin survive the 2017 bull run?
Will it survive its run up to 1 million......
And if you so strongly believe bitcoin can not maintain its run up to 1 million and above then go buy some cardano, nano, ripple, stellar, etc. whatever makes you feel better. Just stop crying to the bitcoin community. Alt coiners would love for you to join them.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:25:54
Awesome post!!!
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:39:25
We get it. You shorted bitcoin....
Stop saying the same thing everyone already knows. 1 btc will be a million dollars in the next five years whether you like or not. Whether the fees are 500 dollars or 1.
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:23:16
Gotcha ��
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:50:25
I knew what you meant
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:10:40
Lol I love you
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:53:09
Not really,
I don’t have a job. I have bitcoins though
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:28:02
They already have in some countries.
What happened? Nothing....
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:53:25

@_date: 2019-05-16 01:59:18

What’s the secret? I didn’t actually study Spanish in school...
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:39:57
Why post Portuguese here? No one cares
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:00:17
I’m sorry buddy but we’re heading to 10k and we will never go below 10k again when we do...
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:39:19
Bought a bitfi to store my bitcoins
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:53:20
Then don’t use btc during the bull run.... Store it like it was gold... It’s not rocket science bro. Think about what you’re saying. I’ll paint a picture for you, imagine btc is getting popular like going to Disneyland got popular. When you go to Disneyland you have to wait in long lines and pay high “fees” because it is POPULAR. Disneyland will remain KING of amusement parks. BITCOIN will remain KING of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:19:29
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:49:28
I would have more fun if it went to a million tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:29:38
You can use it as long as you are willing to pay high fees. Which isn’t an issue at all actually. People will pay for the brand still.
The poor people will just use lightning network or alts if the fees get really high. This is so irrelevant, you are blind.
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:23:50
I would not bet on this in the slightest. I was asking for people’s opinions in a what if scenario. I even clarified that in the post.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:03:51
Happy for you man,
I really believe 12k is coming and then small dip and back to the bulls. But what do I know hehe
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:58:06
Number one rule of crypto my friend.... never forget the seed.
But I hope someone helps you find the seed since you’re still logged into wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-05 14:43:16
I’m 24 and 90 percent of my assets are in bitcoin.
I’m either gonna be broke or rich af at 30. But I’m willing to take the risk. The odds are in your favor bro but
It depends what your situation is.... I see my self as a broke 24 year old and I don’t look at my crypto portfolio. If you’re 40 and have a family to feed you should not be 90 percent in crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:47:09
Lightning network. I’m sorry you don’t like the lightning network but it will be used mostly for transactions under 100 dollars. Also people will trade out there bitcoin and use (xrp) to pay for something. Just an example, who knows if it will actually be xrp.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:18:45
Just use coinbase and send it 2 another wallet.
