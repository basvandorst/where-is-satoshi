I made half your point, i.e. use btc for daily purchases when possible. But you suggest a false dichotomy, hodl OR use daily. They are not mutually exclusive. Hodl for your savings/investment and spend daily when possible.

This old comment. What you're saying makes no sense. Hodling is your savings account. Just because you continue to build your savings account doesn't mean you can get away with spending nothing - you still need to trade currency for basic items like food and clothing etc. Now are most people into bitcoin intentionally avoiding using btc as the currency to buy basic items? No. It's that where we buy basic items they don't take bitcoin. Sure, there are ways to do it in a roundabout way, debit cards prepaid with btc etc. But the answer isn't crying out for people to stop hodling, it's working to get more businesses to accept bitcoin so we can do daily spending in btc.

Months ago? It started almost 4 years ago and continues not because of any comedic value but because it has become lingo/slang within the community. Like any lingo, it's shorthand that communicates an idea so it's probably not disappearing anytime soon.

The misspelling happened on the bitckintalk.org forum and instantly was picked up there before spreading elsewhere. Here is the origin link:

Bitcoin encourages people to speculate, or I'd say invest, with discretionary income, however people still need to exchange currency for things like food,  shelter, household items,  entertainment, etc. As bitcoin becomes more widely accepted there will be more opportunity for bitcoin spending, as you call it. 
However, I have noticed that the excitement around bitcoin can cause some to save/invest more than they might otherwise. So that discretionary income that might have been spent in fiat on something else goes into hodling instead. Sectors that depend on this kind of spending (e.g. tourism) might not be happy about a trend like this, but increased saving seems like a positive for individuals. Plus I attribute a lot of the excitement around bitcoin to its relative newness, still being in early adoption phase (maybe we're breaking out of early adoption now?). Like any groundbreaking technology, once it's mainstream it will just be considered a basic necessity and behavior around spending vs hodling will settle back into something like we see now with fiat.

Ya but Bitcoin isn't just competing with other currencies, it's also competing with payment systems like debit/credit cards that complete transactions in a few seconds. The mass adoption of Bitcoin is going to require that people don't have to take a huge step back in terms of convenience. Don't get me wrong, I see the areas where Bitcoin has huge advantages over traditional currencies and payment systems, but confirmation/transaction time isn't one of those areas when compared to debit/credit cards.

Because you don't have *enough* money to buy what you want. If I have US $70,000 in the bank, but a house costs US $300,000, then I need a loan. Having that money in the bank allows me to put a down payment on the house and have some left over. This looks like a safer bet to the bank than someone with no money in the bank. 
If this isn't the way you want the world to work, then go right ahead and start loaning out money to people who have no money in the bank and no assets. Good luck with that.

This is untrue in the US. In the example of a home loan, they absolutely DO check how much money you have, and want to see a certain amount in your account across the few months prior to loan application - usually equivalent to three mortgage payments. They want to know you're the kind of person that has enough savings on hand to get through lean times. 
Your credit score determines your risk and therefore sets the interest rate - higher your credit score the better your interest rate on the loan. However, it is your income or money in the bank (if you have a lot) that determines the amount of loan you qualify for. If you have no income and no savings, even with a perfect credit score, you will not get a home loan because you can't show how you would make the mortgage payment.
