You can't ban the protocol sure. That's not what he's saying. You can ban the use of it. If buying things with a crypto currency is made illegal then as soon as you are discovered using your coins you can be in trouble. Drugs are illegal, sure they can't stop these, you can even consume those, but if they see you you'll be in trouble. That's as simple as that. If that happens crypto currencies will go back to black market use only.

I really don't quite understand that mizuho thing.
I have a Japanese account. I sent money to their mizuho account so many times without any issues. I made some withdrawals too. Recently they also offered a new way to make deposits with a bank called Japan net bank. Until the last day I sent yens without issues. And he wasn't using mizuho for some time already.


That's a big assumption. Maybe he doesn't want to. Or maybe he simply can't access the cold storage for some reasons.

You know, I met a statist even worse than him last week.
He said:
"No. You don't have the property on your own body. You shouldn't be able to do whatever you want with it. That's why drugs shouldn't be legalized"
"I love all the regulations I had when I started my business. It makes me feel safe."
"Bitcoin is shitty because it helps people laundering money. And laundering money is bad. That's why I love when my Japanese bank is doing investigations on me because I moved too much money overseas. I feel safe. I know that they are doing their best to prevent money laundering and the bad guys. This is harder for them to do human trafficking, prostitution, dealing drugs, etc."
Imagine this for 4 hours. Statism is Hell of a religion..

Do you know why it's mostly wealthy individuals who put their children in private schools? It's because they pay first for the public ones (which they don't use), and after for the private ones. You wouldn't have the same situation if people were not forced to pay for the public ones already.  
Also public schools costs a ton of money, often more than private ones, you just don't see the bill.  
That also doesn't mean you can't have charities, special programs etc for very poor people who can't afford to go to school neither. And by the way, people who can't go to school because it's too pricey are just a market to please. You'll definitely find cheaper private schools to take that market.

For me that's not really the reason.
Korea needs bitcoin because it's fucking impossible to buy anything online right now. You need to give a ton of personal information, you need IE6 and active X. And it's just plain painful. Such a market loss is unbelievable.
Sadly, the IE6/active X is forced by the government for all websites selling stuff. So I'm not sure how it's gonna work with bitcoin...
Internet is seriously unusable in Korea. That's kinda ironic with such a nice network infrastructure. (And I'm not even talking about the internet censorship here)

That's why bitcoin could revive the online shopping market in Korea. If the government let it happens.. That's another big issue. Korea is not a country with a lot of freedom, especially economically. Google map is not really working here for instance (unless you count a big straight line from point A to B as a navigation system..). I heard multiple stories, but naver maps is working, so my guess is just that the government is doing some protectionism.  
So bitcoin? If it's seen as dangerous for Korean companies (banks?) Good chance it's gonna be blocked or really impaired.

Yes and no. The real issue is that asics are not available for everyone. GPUs are available for everyone. So because everyone can mine easily it makes it _more_ decentralized. That doesn't mean some rich as fuck guy can't buy millions of GPUs and mine, but he'll still have a hard time to compete with _everyone_. It's still better than with asics only accessible by a few, it's more fair if you see what I mean.

The issue is that the encryption feature on android is not finished. It's poorly done. First it doesn't encrypt the sd card folder on most of phones. Secondly the pass for the encryption needs to be the same as the screen unlock one. So, unless you are ok with typing a passphrase each time you want to unlock your phone you are fucked.  
There is a way to change the screen pass after the encryption but you need to be root and still that's far from perfect in my opinion.  
I wish they could fix that encryption feature in fact.

What you need to understand is that it's not Good Guys vs Bad Guys. It's not black and white and it's far more complicated. And it's NOTHING like WW2.
Israel is attacked by Hamas' rockets every day as you can see here:
They are destroyed by the Iron Dome, a shield. Who are the terrorists already? These rockets are targeting _civilians_ on purpose.  
But that's not even the point. I just want to point that it's a war (and not a religious war, I don't know why you are talking about religion. It's a territory war), and not a genocide or what the fuck else you are thinking about. There are 20% of arabs living happily in Israel, and most of them are Palestinians.
I would just recommend to read this, and maybe you'll understand that things are far more complicated than it looks:

Some people like to drink slowly and chatting. 5 minutes a beer? You are just trying to get shit faced or something.  
I personally like to go to the bar on Friday at around 7pm to finish on Saturday at 11am. If I was drinking at your pace that would be impossible.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:17:44
Maybe that's because he's already replaced by someone else?
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:48:56
Oh yeah sure. My bank is under a lot of regulations. They don't even know how to make a bank transfer without fucking up. (For information. French bank. Société générale)  
My bank is a fiat MtGox.  
Regulations are exactly what keep these fuckers alive.
@_date: 2014-08-20 05:53:32
Totally. I think South Korea can be a great market for bitcoin though. Especially when you look at how hard it is to buy something online here (you need IE6, you pay by bank transfers, you need to install like 6 blobs and 2 keyloggers, etc.. it's middle age).
@_date: 2014-08-18 04:50:56
They already support KRW withdrawals/deposits. They are a little slow for the withdrawals though.

@_date: 2014-03-06 15:42:02
Yes. Because I don't really get the difference. I can mix them pretty easily. Same with the verbs. Learnt/learned, etc. I'm not sure if I'm writing to UK or US people so depending on my mood I can switch. I think, if he's not a native speaker, you should not really try to analyze his writing too much. The writing of non-native people can change a lot with time too.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:39:38
My guess is that he's solvent, he has the coins. He just can't show an address or a transaction because it could be risky for some reason.
This theory makes a lot of sense:

It happens all the time with banks too you know..
What about the recent events in Korea where they lost data of 40% of their population?
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:11:21
If I was rich that's something I would do just to show that we don't need the government. That even in a total free market people can be protected, even more than in a world with a government. And that we found a solution much faster than them with their banks and their money printing.
Now.. is there a such hardcore rich libertarian over there? Maybe. Maybe not...

An important thing to note is that a lot of bitcoins users and especially the early adopters are libertarians and mainly anarcho capitalists. So you'll easily find them breaking rules imposed by the state... I have no issue with him selling explosives, guns, etc.
Edit: to be clear. When I say "breaking rules imposed by the state", I'm not saying they are "criminals". It's very easy to break rules imposed by the state and most of their rules are just here to give the state more power. For instance not paying taxes is something an anarcho capitalist is interested to do (but mostly can't). Selling guns doesn't mean killing people neither, same for explosives. Roger Ver didn't violate the non aggression principle here. He didn't commit any fraud neither.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:25:43
And make sure that people leave him alone. I personally think it's our duty to protect him as most as we can. He's gonna be harassed soon.
@_date: 2014-12-25 07:55:10
I would argue you need the opposite. You need an anonymous coin with a sidechain that offers non-anonymity if needed.
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:53:00
Exactly. Bitcoin is secure if you know what you are doing. But most of people use their birthdate as a password..  
That's why we need things like coinkite imho.
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:45:23
I bought a lot of goxBTC just before their shutdown. So I had something like 40 BTC at Gox.
I'm still a total ancap!
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:01:11
That's not exactly the biggest issue right now. The issue is the image bitcoin is getting from this. We know that it's not a problem with bitcoin, but say that to my mother. This is definitely gonna hurt bitcoin. I'm not sure for how long though. The current uptrend looks more like a bull trap than anything. The story is not finished yet neither..

I use hard drugs regularly. I have an awesome life, a very good job, I'm social, I live in two countries, and overall I'm happy. It's not about the drugs, it's about the people. Some people are just more addicted than others, and more irresponsible than others.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:40:43
You are talking about the statists?
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:42:37
Karpeles said the opposite. It doesn't count because he thinks he can give back the Bitcoins to his customers. That means he still must have access to most of the coins. Or at least plans to.
@_date: 2014-06-24 09:47:33
You are obviously trying to buy some drugs on a darknet market.  
Don't do this like that... send the bitcoins to your wallet first. And tumble the coins before sending these to a market.
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:52:09
That's not because of the regulations at all.
At first everything was lost. It took years and a very aggressive campaign by the customers. They mostly helped themselves. And by the way they didn't get everything back neither.
Stealing is still stealing. They should be prosecuted for that. That has nothing to do with regulations.
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:40:15
Nobody can say anything yet for sure.
But there is a good chance, at least at first, that bitcoin stay the base currency, the strongest one, because it was the first one and has the biggest network. It's the safest crypto currency for now. The alts will be there and work alongside it for some particular uses.  
But that's still all speculation.
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:18:03
Because I have a Japanese account. It's easy and reliable for me. I really hope another exchange will open in Japan but it seems unlikely.. So for now I just hope mtgox can get their shit together.

What I'm worried is that he must be thinking he'll get back his seized coins (there is no 100% proof they are seized, but I personally think this is the most plausible scenario). I kinda doubt it. I'm still waiting for my work uploaded on megaupload you know..
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:42:09
That doesn't mean anything. 1 confirmation on the dogecoin network doesn't weight the same value than 1 confirmation on the bitcoin one.

@_date: 2014-04-06 06:17:58
They are voluntary yes. That's a good thing. But maybe a minimum shouldn't be set. Because it looks like a government price fixing if you see what I mean. A better way would be to not put any default, and give an indication of the current rate. Miners could be able to broadcast their rate to the network for instance.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:20:16
This has nothing to do with regulation.
If you are stealing money you have to face criminal charges. Business or not.  
The company can be audited. And you should use audited companies. But there is no reason to enforce it. I would use an exchange which has been certified secure by &lt;famous security company&gt; instead of a non audited one.

Never said bitcoin is mine. But you are imposing your rules on it. If it's regulated in the US, Europe will follow soon. Do I need to go to Somalia or something to make a bitcoin business without regulations?

He was convicted by default. He didn't show up. And that's a totally different case.  
It's just unlikely because only someone pretty retarded would think he can get out jail free after robbing his own "bank" of millions of dollars. As a ceo he's far too much exposed. The risk of being put in jail for a very long time is far too high. Especially when you could just have continued your business as usual. That just doesn't make sense.  
BUT he still can be accused of gross incompetence depending on the circumstances.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:18:17
Well, you don't pay 8% tax when you buy other currencies so of bitcoin is a currency you shouldn't have to pay anything.
EDIT: Actually I'm retracting what I said! It looks like we pay the 8% fee in Japan. At least this is what bitflyer is saying, and the price on bitflyer is even lower that the current price on btcbox so I assume btcbox is doing the same and this is not clearly explained. What a rip off.
Edit2: ok. That's what I was thinking. From April 1st the 8% tax is removed in fact. Exchanges are just not up to date yet
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:55:05
Deregulation does not mean that nobody is gonna check the food. Instead of only one entity you can get competition in the field and multiple entities checking that your food/drugs are safe. They can then give their safety label, which helps to sell more as the customers know they are safe.
@_date: 2018-10-25 00:27:25
Not sure either but I always find funny when people in this sub think Japan is ahead with crypto currency because it's far from being true. Each time you subscribe on an exchange you first have a ton of information to give (but that's not necessarily much different than elsewhere on that point), but you also have to wait for them to send you a letter to your home before being able to trade. So convenient.  
Taxation in Japan is also horrendous. It's on top of your salary. So it's really not hard to be on the top tier and pay a lot of taxes. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 04:21:45
Oh well I can always join international ones but doing an international bank transfer every time I buy is gonna be costly and annoying quickly. =)
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:41:53


So you are saying these companies will do a crappy job. ALL of them? Seems quite unlikely as they have competition and want to stay in business. If a label is well known to do a crappy job and/or is corrupt, people will stop buying stuff that got their label as it has no value in term of safety. Soon enough they'll be out of business.  
On the opposite, when you have ONE FDA, you have no choice. The FDA marked dangerous drugs as safe in the past.

No they don't accept bitcoin.


So your money basically needs to be on that exchange. You can't directly use your bitcoins. That means you have to register to that exchange and give your ID.
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:36:08
Even if you hold, sooner or later you'll have to use these coins. Unless you want to die with a stash of coins and then you got nothing out of it. So if these coins are accepted nowhere that's not good. (If you have only exchanges, governments will track your sells and tax you. Much harder if you use your coins directly)
@_date: 2018-07-08 04:14:15


So you are NEVER gonna do anything with your coins? You are gonna die with them? How useful!  
Of course my point is only making sense if you have more money in btc than fiat, otherwise I agree with you. I can buy a house with bitcoin but not with my fiat. And I'm also not talking about buying bread.  
I personally want merchant adoption (or at least person to person) as this is a great way not to pay taxes on my gains. Every time you sell bitcoins for fiat you have the risk of government tracking it.

It's not a centralized point of failure. If Blockchain dies I can still use my wallet.  
I'm also using the chrome extension only. Everything done locally.
Bitcoin-qt on a computer is not really safer.  A machine can be compromised in the same way.
The thing is without your passwords. Without your 2FA neither. It's fairly safe. (Not foolproof, but nothing is). My passwords are on lastpass with 2FA, had any password leaked from lastpass since their first day?
A paper wallet has its insecurities and is impractical for a currency called the "currency of the internet".

I see one use. When the user want to be anonymous because his illness is related to an illegal action, and the doctor want to stay anonymous because he could actually be associated to a criminal.
The thing is, at least in my country, patients are protected under the Hippocratic oath. I'm not sure that's the case everywhere, first, and secondly I'm not sure what happens if the cops are interrogating the doctor. It seems it's very country dependent.
So in this case the service makes sense and is kinda interesting. But the website admin really need to verify that each doctor is a real one...

I'm doing the exact same thing. The most important thing is to "believe" in bitcoin. This is money. So now my goal is to have as much bitcoins as possible. I'm not trading anymore to get fiat. I'm trading between different cryptocurrencies in order to have even more bitcoins.
Another good point with bitcoins is that it's a good way to do some savings without even thinking. It's harder to spend bitcoins so you tend to keep them in your wallet more (I mean, it's not like every bar out there is accepting bitcoin)

This service looks a lot like another one called "justAnswer". Were some experts reply to your questions for some money. And the pages are publicly accessible. It works actually...  
Maybe the idea behind putting everything in public view is more to prevent people getting advices for too serious conditions.
I used justAnswer one time for a dermatological issue. I was pretty impressed by the result in fact, in a few minutes I had an answer, which condition I must have, and which OTC medicine I should take. Healed in a few days. At first I thought I had some std and freaked out..

@_date: 2013-04-24 11:01:12
I don't get why it's that so much of an issue. blockchain is sending your private keys to your mail address. Even if tomorrow blockchain doesn't exist anymore you can still import everything inside bitcoin-qt for instance. They have a chrome extension, two factor auth + second password for transactions, and everything is encrypted. The chances someone is getting access to your wallet is lower than someone accessing your online bank account and making a transfer (at least with my shitty french bank, they don't even have 2 factor auth. And yeah I can easily put $20,000 on it).
A paper wallet is the only thing I would say is more secure (but when you are doing a transaction you need to be connected to internet, so heh... everything can happen)

That's not the point. He said "deniable encryption", but he was talking of the Rubberhose. This is a broader concept than just using Steganography. 
That's a bad idea by the way. [MAID]( is a much better one. Deniable encryption is just worse for everyone. Because after the first decryption, you can't prove that there isn't another key. This is the best way to be tortured forever.

Oh yeah of course!
My father is a doctor. I had that discussion with him multiple times. About remote consultations. He said it's very difficult for most of cases. He need to touch his patient. He can't give a diagnostic otherwise. He could also miss very a important illness.  
I see services like Just Answer only for easy to recognize issues. And in fact, if the guy is a real doctor he's just gonna reply "sorry but you should see a doctor in person. I can't tell remotely". The problem is being sure every doctor registered on the website is a real one. I think JustAnswer has some verification process. OP's service should have one otherwise I'm not touching it. =)

Could you point me the parts of the code that make you think that? Because from what I've read, that's pretty standard _clean_ code. Not impressive, but clean (I wouldn't have used c++ and boost but C or erlang, but whatever.)
Bitcoin is not impressive in term of cryptography, this is very well known concepts for ages. In fact, I'm wondering why it didn't become huge sooner. Look at [DigiCash]( for instance in the 90's.

This is slightly different. Usually, when you lose cash someone else is gonna find it and use it. Usually. But even when it's not the case this is still not really a problem because there isn't a finite amount of fiat like there is a finite amount of bitcoins.

Yes. And they were all careless or using real web wallets (I.e the website owns the wallet and is able to access it. So the btc are not their). Most of these people were not using 2FA and/or were using bad passwords. No passwords for withdraw neither.


I don't know how many but that's not the point. If they don't they should. The extension is available on the Blockchain website and clearly recommended by the devs.

True, if you ask directly the author and he agrees, that's ok. But that's neither practical nor really free software.
The license name should be present in the source file. Let's say someone is getting this gist from someone else and has absolutely no knowledge of this thread, he can't be aware of what he can do (or not) with this code.

I'm kinda agree with you. But at the same time trading exists in every currency. Is it really an issue? Right now it may be one because we are so few using bitcoins that rich people can easily influence the price. But in the future it should be more stable...?

That happens with banks everyday too. They have special departments just for that.
There are a ton of ways for that to happen. PEBKAC, malwares, etc. That's not directly blockchain.info fault.

Nonsense. In a _true_ free market (which crypto-currencies are) that doesn't happen. There is a true competition here.

That may be the only thing this device really have yeah, solar powered and low energy. (still, in Japan you can find phones with solar panels, and they are selling batteries with solar panels too)
Is that really sufficient? Maket adoption could be much faster without the need of a new device. But I admit that it _should_ be more secure than having a wallet on your phone. (should. I still want to see more)

Nothing is obvious. If you can't prove it it's still uncertain.

That's not true. I'm regularly trading on the ltc/btc market and I earned a ton of btc like that. The volatility is higher.

Why not putting the info on the bitcoin wiki or even on Wikipedia instead?

blockchain.info and inputs.io have nothing in common.
Look more closely at how blockchain.info is working. This is not really an "online wallet". If blockchain.info is cracked, they'll just have a bunch of encrypted wallets they can't use. And even if blockchain.info dies, you have the encrypted backups.
