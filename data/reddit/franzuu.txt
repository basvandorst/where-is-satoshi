Your bank is bad? What kind of OPSEC is that? How can you just call and ask money to be moved from an account to another?

He makes several very good points and you'd be a fool to dismiss them. Maybe its smart for you to dismiss him publicly if you are intent on riding the bubble/wave.
1. Manipulation. Bitcoin is being manipulated, whether it is from the miner's side by spamming transactions or manipulating the transactions that get in when you win a block.  
  
Then there are the exchanges. During the initial 11 to 19K jump that ended in coinbase crashing there was a very suspicious pattern of price pumping and stabilizing. To stabilize there was a big sell wall and a big buy wall set up that was priced 1 cent lower. When the sell wall cleared naturaly or was removed by the person who set it up there'd be only a handful of bitcoins that you'd have to buy all at once to make the price jump $200-500+. You buy up the coins, increase the price and set up stabilizing buy and sell walls. Its a shame GDAX went down, I'd love to have seen where the price would have ended up at.  
  
  
2. Electricity. I'm interested to see what happens if bitcoin goes to 100,000, the mining industry grows to take advantage of it, the difficulty increases and bitcoin goes back down to 20K. How does that affect the larger than needed mining economy and how does it influence future decisions to invest into mining?  
  
  
If bitcoin continues to grow and starts using up all of the excess power capacity or subsidies become untenable for the host country (either directly monetary or mismanagement of natural resources, nature, pollution, health of the populace etc.), of course a wall will be hit where you can't expand your mining op in a certain location.  
  
  
As far as someone not letting the bitcoin network grow to the point that it'd be deemed harmful, I personally don't think so. As long as there is money to be made people will find a way. You can mine anywhere in the world, even if your country effectively bans mining that just means that mining became that much more profitable somewhere else in the world. Even if bitcoin mining meant that the apocalypse of global warming and sea levels rising was heralded in 100 years too soon, you can't stop it. Either it is profitable and people do it or its not.  
  
  
3. IRS. Don't be stupid with crime.  
  
  
4. Bitcoin in a recession or panic. That is true. We had a bitcoin catastrophe in 2013 when the price dropped from 1,300 to 300. If the price dropped by 3000 today I would't blink.  
  
  
I believe that Bitcoin and the technologies it represents have an intrinsic value in the form of services and capabilities that our governments want to take away from us, some more than others. When you take away the bubble you are left with those core values that are very important to me.  
  
  
5. Unpredictability, privacy, freedom, "criminality", potential for loss, regulations or lack thereof, power usage, loss of control. All recipes for knee-jerk reactions by central governments. What would the global reaction need to be like for it to kill bitcoin and the technologies supporting it?  
  
You have politicians in the UK and rest of EU wanting to ban encryption. For technology companies to build in backdoors or side channels for their intelligence agencies.  
 
 
No doubt there are ongoing operations by intelligence agencies to influence, infiltrate and control the development of bitcoin.  
  
  
As long as bitcoin remains open and there is community involvement, it'll be hard to completely subvert it.

Yeah, new faces clearing a backlog/wall 10-50 BTC at a time to pump the price an easy $500, make headlines and get more dumb money in.

This is what I saw right before the crash when the price was pumped by 1K + in the previous 20 seconds   
  
There is a free bitcoin for you in the 18200-19500 gap, this is not a healthy market.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:32
there is 20 BTC of sell orders between 18,000 and 19,500. Its going to rise fast.  
  
aaaand GDAX is down, gg
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:32
The blockchain is clogged as fuck, over 190,000 unconfirmed transactions and rising FAST!   
  
  
You can't move your coins between exchanges. Big money is pumping the coin really fucking hard on coinbase. Harcore manipulation.

there is nothing to adopt, small money is gambling atm, big money is manipulation
