Do many banks have APIs that bots can talk to? They could charge cc's fairly easily, but anything else is harder/impossible (as far as I know).
Using a bitcoin wallet is dead easy for a bot, plus it's much cheaper than the typical 2% cost for a cc charge.
@_date: 2016-04-18 22:15:22
Well, bots are just programmed to do their master's bidding, so if a programmer programs a bot to request people to do stuff for it, say for stuff the programmer could never do all of themselves, why not?
Of course, an industrious programmer would then write a bot that served that bot and earn all the monies.

I remember when the market cap was $1M...back then bitcoins seemed extremely risky and everyone was unsure whether it was a huge waste of time.
Right now it doesn't seem so risky, but it still feels very similar. $7B seems like it's way undervalued, and I wouldn't be surprised if we're talking about $1T market cap within the next 10 years or so.

Yes, it still makes more sense to spend your USD instead of BTC to buy steam games, if you have both.
But, like all assets, when you run out of shitty assets like cash, you have to start using the real assets.
On top of this, of course them holding 0% means it's purely a sales move, and will only add sell pressure to bitcoins, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
Part of the reason companies like Valve don't want to hold any bitcoins is because of the volatility. Sell pressure actually reduces volatility if it is consistent.

Aside from the fact that there's actually a shit load of gold in the solar system, it only has value because we assign it value.
We used to think gold was great to store our wealth in that isn't fiat...and then someone invented bitcoins and now we think that's great too. 
There's  the component of gold which is actually useful for industry or entertainment, and there's the much, much bigger part that's there for speculation or wealth storage. Bitcoins are far easier to manage and obtain than gold is, for that second part. It could easily be replaced by something better, when that comes along, but so what? people will trade this for that and their wealth will be retained again.

If you want something that will actually help, start budgeting and stop living paycheck to paycheck. Take control of your money, and learn to start spending it on paper before you spend it in reality. And then limit how much you deviate from your plan, or learn to make better plans.
Do it for free in openoffice calc (or google spreadsheet), or pay for a ynab subscription. Watch the ynab videos on how to budget when you're broke af ( It works, I started like this from $10k in debt.
Once you have control, start squeezing until you have about 10% of your money every paycheck going to long term savings. Put some in crypto, put the rest in vanguard or whatever recommends. The sooner you start doing this the better off you'll be in 30 years. The earliest money has the most impact, and the higher you make this the better off you'll be.
If that all sounds too hard then something you might not know is how good you're going to feel having a little bit secured away in savings you're not going to touch. It lets you stop worrying about stupid shit, do less emotional eating, want to spend less money on stuff that's going to harm you. Financial stress is one of the worst things you can put your body through.

I think there's a pretty good chance it's him.
The deception required to fake all of the evidence is huge...that's not a reason for certainty, of course, but it reduces the chance of a miss somewhat.
He also displays all the hall-marks of uncertainty - does he want the credit? Of course he does...is he scared of being known for it? Of course he is.
Now that all the big boys in finance are now by-and-large pro-bitcoin, it's a lot safer to come out.
As a side note, this was a tell-tale for me:


Australians only use the word 'bloody' when they really, really mean it. It's hard to fake, because it requires strong emotions and appropriate body language. It can usually be translated as "I'm feeling overwhelmed by my emotions at the moment, please look at my body language and tone to interpret how I'm feeling"

But his potentially faked emails do explain why he disappeared.
He complains in one of them something along the lines of "I've written hundreds of papers and everyone hates me, and everyone loves the paper without my name on it." 
He also said something about how everyone preferred the myth to him being the reality, so he was taking leave and doing other things like lecture and what-not. This was around 2011 in the emails, but I'm not sure when SN actually stepped away and stopped communicating.
This sort of ego comes through when he briefly returned: Everyone thought Dorien was SN, and SN replied from his original account that he was not dorien. This is in line with a strong ego - if he wasn't going to get recognition, Dorien sure as hell won't.
It's possible that no one wants to believe it's him, because he comes across as a turd. How can our savior be a turd? Impossible!
*if* CD == SN, he'll be caught between this ego and his strong desire for privacy (which CD talks about in his video, and SN by his nature). I would be surprised if CD ever decided to prove he was SN.

I still don't understand why microtransactions are hard enough to warrant this convoluted solution. Someone gives you an address...you send an amount plus transaction fee. The fee, if all outputs are ~~less~~ greater than 0.1 btc, input has a large priority and is less than 1kb is nothing. Otherwise it is approx $0.03.
Do people seriously want to send less than 5c to each other?
If it's a case of "because we can", then the lower satoshi figures will be accessible when the bitcoin price rises. As the price rises, the transaction fee will be hard coded to less, as it has in the past.

These people know that bitcoins are way better than the system that they're using now, except bitcoins have received a hugely bad public image from all the scams, failures, silk-road stuff, and so on, so haven't been able to push things past their more ignorant bosses.
Someone then came along and announced, "It's not bitcoins that are awesome, it's the blockchain technology!" and this allowed them to talk about bitcoins again without mentioning the dirty word.
They will realize at some point that doing it all within bitcoins is the best, most secure option they could possibly take.
The stupidest part of all this, is that banks are in the prime position to take bitcoins to the masses. They deal with security day in and day out, have all the infrastructure in place to target the bankless (mobile apps), and all they have to do is get their fingers out of their arses. It's far simpler for an existing large bank to add bitcoins as a currency than it is for small timers to start their own banks with bitcoin and USD (or whatever) as the only currency.

That's right, it doesn't do anything to help smaller miners, but larger ones who do earn shares have a lower risk of insufficient earnings before difficulty changes, if P2Pool has more hashpower. P2Pool's only real benefit is that it's less likely that a miner will inadvertently give their mining power to someone who can mess with the blockchain. It can't suddenly make a non-profitable miner profitable.

Pretty much. Implementing your own bitcoin wallet based store isn't difficult at all, especially not for a company like Microsoft. As far as I can see, the only merchants that will drive real value towards bitcoins are those that actually accept bitcoins.
Accepting bitcoin via bitpay is no different from accepting some other random new fiat currency.
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:26:21
It's totally awesome that companies like Bitpay are willing to give full salaries to get people to work on open source code. It's a win-win for both bitcoin businesses and open source.
Other open source developers who are yet to go on a payroll, and spend a day or a week of their free time programming open source stuff are generally eligible to join the bitcoin share list (cryptocoin related projects) or devcoin share list (general open source) run by the devcoin (developer-coin) project. You get a share in the monthly devcoin block payout, which isn't a huge amount, but it's basically getting something extra for what you do already for nothing. You can see a history and current payouts of the blocks [here]( 
I'm the admin for the share lists, and you can contact me in a pm here or on the  forum if you think you're eligible and you want to be on the list. You can also find out more on devtome [here](
You get paid in devcoins, but that's just because of how it's administered. The real goal is to proliferate open source development, including bitcoin and related source code. I hope it doesn't offend anyone that I posted a devcoin related thing here, but it is definitely something that wants to benefit all bitcoin developers so I thought it would be ok.
@_date: 2014-05-18 22:50:34
I think a major point of bitcoins is that you control who you give your bitcoins to.
Having a recurring pull payment option in the wallet means someone else has the power to control your flow of money. In the case of credit/debit cards, the banks are in control, and with bitcoins a similar third party would need to have control of the actual coins to allow something like this, like coinbase, etc.
If a person really trusts the vendor, they may as well give them the private key to a bitcoin address with funds on it, so both parties have the option to move the funds (to cancel subscription, for example).

It depends entirely on how many people with funds already on Gox wish to buy btc vs how many wish to stay in cash (and of course how many btc holders wish to cash out). If the price drives up past bitstamp/btc-e etc, it wouldn't make sense to sell on another exchange.
If they reopen the exchange and only allow trickle withdrawals, then there's a good chance the price will catch up to but not overtake the other exchanges. If they allow full withdrawals then the other exchanges will likely be dragged down to some middle ground.
As for sellers, why would people who were storing coins on gox want to suddenly sell them? They would probably want to withdraw to their own wallets more so. People who bought gox coins may want to withdraw and sell, because they'd be getting massive returns. I don't think it's an easy answer of up or down, but we can pretty much guarantee volatility.

Are they in a bubble where they don't know what the world is saying about them right now? If it's all untrue, why on earth wouldn't they say something to the contrary?
It's still possible they're just upgrading their servers, but it's all very 'odd' - twitter removed, leak, heads of exchanges ganging up on gox, trading shutdown, site shutdown with no announcement at all. This isn't normal "we're just upgrading our servers, brb" behavior. The circumstantial evidence is mounting, with little to the contrary.

While the variance thing doesn't add up, it doesn't make them a scam. They seem to actually have hashpower as they claim, and if they are legit, there's a good reason to not join p2pool, as it really can mess with hashpower .
I bought an old coincraft desk off them through asic miner, and was dismayed that it only ran at 850gh/s on my p2pool node. On a regular pool it does 1.1 th/s, which is a huge difference. 
P2pool development has basically stopped, too, with the author citing not getting any donation support from nodes so needing to focus time elsewhere. One less layer of support when moving a large operation, and they are accountable to their shareholders in this.

They could do that anyway, but if large quantities started leaving the exchange and went through tumblers it gets a lot more painful to follow, assuming said crims are withdrawing in little bits.
They still may have been withdrawing from the hot wallet, but in this case they at least have MtGox's compliance by the balls, at least until it's clear whether they were complicit (another reason to hold the funds).

The price of a coin has more to do with people holding it than it does with people transacting it. These large companies still work in dollars, any transaction fees they're going to be earning will be converted to the lowest risk ($$), and then into longer term safer assets. 
The price is going down because more people using the coin to transact will create a sell pressure on the coin. What you want, for prices to go up, is for everyone to buy coins and do nothing with them.

Yep, if it was indeed a proper cold wallet it would have to be connected manually just long enough to do a transfer to the hot wallet. If it was a lie, well, anything's possible.
If they had a proper cold wallet, all deposit addresses were probably directly sent to that wallet, so when they recharged the hot wallet, they would have to assume it was from people who had deposited in that cold wallet, so they probably thought it was fine, and it would have been, had they not been 'leaking' funds via transaction malleability.
This doesn't answer why no one saw the software balance of the hot wallet being huge, though. It should be exactly 750k, unless it was reset to what was transferred every time (another mistake)

Also, [Blisterpool]( is paying 20% bonus at the moment because it's testing devcoin software.

Yeah, if it only causes you harm, and places no burden on the rest of society, you should be free to do it.
Cigarettes are done reasonably well in Australia. They cause known health issues both directly and passively, but remain legal. All they did was ban it in crowded places like bars/restaurants in Australia (and in some European countries) because they were protecting non-smokers...and most people accepted it, because it's fair. They could still smoke at home/open air where it doesn't hurt anyone else.
Regarding the laws, it makes sense to make them fluid based on the information at the time. Research is always being done, and new information is always appearing. You do have to run both scenarios in similar environments to really know the effects, though, so it's good that Marijuana in particular is getting some freedoms even just to see what effect it actually has.

oh I thought I did - you're right, it doesn't, they could do that anyway. 
(an alternative is that) Seizing limits how much the crims can get out at any one time, until they're identified or whatever. It makes it easier to see who's taking out a lot of money without them getting it all at once. Maybe they were trying to get out a lot now which caused the shutdown. It was either that or banking problems translating into more people getting cash out via btc, causing the same outcome.

Allow me to try another example to see if I've got it:
Company A produces alpaca wool
Company B produces socks from that wool
Company C sells those socks retail via the web.
B buys a whole bunch of wool from A, and A logs a payment request with the payment processor. B doesn't have any spare coins so the debt just sits there for a bit. B acknowledges the debt on the processor, and assigns it a priority and/or percentage throughput.
B produces the socks and sends them off to C, lodging a payment request with the processor, directed at C. C also doesn't have any spare coins, so only acknowledges the debt and assigns it a priority and/or throughput percentage.
Customer buys a sock, C's website directs them to the payment processor (including the amount payable), which looks at C's payment request table. 
The payment processor sees that B is owed money by C, and further that A is owed money by B, so gives the customer A's address, and once confirmed, reduces the payment request between A and B, as well as B and C for the same amount. 
If the request table is empty, the payment processor just gives C's bitcoin address. 
The only reason I mention throughput percentages is because most companies will need to keep some cash for paying things like salaries and utilities, etc, while supplier debt might be too large to keep paying off first. Is there a better solution to this? Who gets paid first?

This could mean a number of things. If we can assume for a second this is legit (and the photo is strong evidence with the building card, but not full proof - a newspaper or the chat on the pc would have been better)
1) Private keys have been corrupted or lost while they tried to get it back together, and it will take some time to get backups from the desert.
2) They've already been hit by banks, lawsuits or a government and their assets have been legally frozen, so nothing can be released, even though they technically still have it.
3) They have to trawl through every single of the 32 million transactions and confirm legitimate ownership of transactions based on modified or unmodified transaction ids.
4) The coins are being held ransom by the yakuza.

While the government may not own people's bodies, it does have a responsibility to intervene when it comes to your interaction with others. If while under those influences you put others in danger, there is room for them to act.

Another way to understand what they're explaining is like this:
12 mod 5 is the same as 12/5 = 2 plus 2 remainder, the remainder is the mod result, so answer is 2.
50 mod 7 =&gt; 50/7 = 7 plus 1 remainder, so answer is 1.
120 mod 8 =&gt; 15 plus 0 remainder, so answer is 0, etc.
The clock is a correct analogy (it's doing mod 12), but it's adding unnecessary and confusing information (string, clock)

While it fits the quantity and time-frame well, I see quite a few double transactions, but not an incredible amount.
EG 5000 in/out, then another 5000 in/out, 3500 in/out followed by another 3500 in/out.
This does occur frequently, but we're talking maybe 5-10 per page of 25 input/output pairs. I would think there would be a lot more, even of weird numbers like 263 in/out, then another one of the same value, to show it was taking advantage of Transaction Malleability.

Just the initial loans from the Fed out to everyone else. Banks then lend it to people who spend it, which act as deposits in other people's accounts, pay off their own loans, etc. The deposit in another bank means that bank can loan out 9 times its value.
It basically works out that each bank has to keep 10% worth of deposits for all the money they have out on loans, and those deposits, one way or another, come from the Fed.

The simplest way to describe p2pool is that it is a network of nodes (servers set up by individuals) all working together to find a block. Each node is just a connection point, and miners connect to any of the many nodes to be a part of the network.
The miners earn shares by connecting to any node, then finding blocks in a special p2pool blockchain with its own (much smaller) difficulty, and when a block is found it is split by those shares found. No one controls it.
To switch, just pick one from a list here (there are other lists too): 
or if you are interested in hosting your own node there's a great guide that includes merged mining here: 
I run  which is a p2pool node which does merge mine but the hashpower isn't enough to really get much, so I don't distribute that yet. Instead, I pay a 20% bonus in devcoins to any block income (payment for helping me test a new devcoin client under development). The hybrid pool takes a 10% fee from bitcoins but that gets paid back in devcoins too, on top of the bonus - I will reduce that fee once the hash rate is high enough to still trigger my scripts with a lower fee. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:25:17
What's more, unless the attacker was able to connect as many different verified users, those double payments should have a record pattern somewhere. Even if the transaction was altered, and mtgox sent it twice, it would still show as a double transaction on the blockchain to the same address, wouldn't it?
Basically a double spend but the other way around.
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:04:47
I suppose it does it to get the larger miners to switch for overall hashpower boost (helps with variance). I can definitely make the minimum cutoff lower. What do people consider too low as a dust payment these days?
edit: I've made it 10x lower now, if it's still not low enough (and no one complains about dust etc), I'll reduce it by 10 again. I might have to change it to mbits or ubits...gets so confusing :/

@_date: 2014-02-25 08:56:39
The bitcoin price is only dropping due to market confidence,  and it will regain once the final outcome is officiated and absorbed. The public is making an assumption that there is something wrong with bitcoins, but there isn't. It's like thinking there's something wrong with cash because a local brothel went out of business.
The bitcoin network is fine, and if transaction malleability really was the cause of MtGox's woes, then it was because of their supreme incompetence and multiple levels of failure. Simple software or manual checks would have prevented this. They would have had to not analysed their accounts in over two years to not notice something as glaring as this sooner.
If MtGox files for bankruptcy, then it's extremely unlikely that it was because of TM. There's something else missing.

The last two weeks have been relatively unlucky for p2pool, but the three fortnights before that were great. We did have a lot of people joining p2pool this week but left almost as quickly (judging by my own node), presumably because not enough blocks were found, which is double bad luck. To potential p2pool miners: if you're going to mine on p2pool, you've got to go long haul, and your persistence will encourage others to do the same.
Here's a breakdown of my results back to 17/3, in fortnights. I know the pool hashrate has varied a lot during this time, but it's held 1% of the network consistently:
05/06-18/06: 8 blocks found
22/05-04/06: 18 blocks found
08/05-21/05: 13 blocks found
24/04-07/05: 15 blocks found
10/04-23/04: 7 blocks found
27/03-09/04: 6 blocks found
17/03-26/03: 9 blocks found (10 days)
In total, I received a 116% ROI in bitcoins (excluding electricity) during this time, which is better than what I had originally estimated by this date. Including electricity, I basically purchased that extra 16% at today's market rate...so I've just hit break even, but still have a couple profitable miners I can sell for about 30% original purchase.

Yes, if this is all true (and it probably isn't unless gox's programmers and management are all unbelievably blind and stupid), the hypothesis is that some people were clever enough to discover they could trick MtGox to send the same transaction twice...for over a year and to the tune of 750,000 btc. 
They supposedly tricked them by requesting a withdrawal which went through, then before it's added to the blockchain in a mining event, change the transaction details so it's still legitimate, but MtGox can't see it any more. The miners add the transaction as normal, so the payout goes ahead, then the trickster tells MtGox it didn't go through, and their system reports  that it doesn't see the transaction id they originally sent, so they send it again. 
A simple check of the send and receive addresses before issuing the second payment would also have stopped it, because that would have shown it definitely was paid.

One of those things rich parents teach you is how to handle money - budgeting, financial education, etc, and the other is by giving you access to people with knowledge.
As you say statistically people with rich parents have better chances of success, but in every single instance, someone in that family line went from nothing to rich, and passed on what they learned. Somewhere along the line, someone learned how to be rich and stay rich.
I think education and access to knowledge will play a bigger role than parents in the new always connected tech age of the recent generation.

Well it's not uncommon for established supply chains to work on credit, cleared once a month or so. Presumably these payment forwarding relationships would only work where the seller believes the buyer is capable of reselling effectively. High risk resellers would have to pay up front.
For example, I manufacture indian simmer sauces, I get my ingredients from a supplier I have a strong relationship with, and pay them monthly on invoices older than a certain age. Retailers take my product and pay me between 30-90 days of receiving them. My supplier is risking me not selling any jars, and I'm risking the retailer not selling them (while they promise to pay in 30 days, they can still go bankrupt in the meantime, and have). Most of the time it works out just fine, occasionally it fails, but that's business.
A processor could speed payments up going back down a trusted chain, so I suppose that's one less thing to keep track of. Still have to verify the invoices and all that, just not the payment side of things.

After reading the leaked document again it says something about "cold storage was drained by a leak in the hot wallet". I'm not fully sure I understand how that works, exactly, but it sounds like it could have been a reporting bug in MtGox wallet code that went unnoticed for a very long time. The hot wallet sent out some money, was told it was false and sent it out again until it ran dry. Then someone manually (assuming it really was "cold") connect the cold wallet to transfer funds across to be drained by the hot wallet again. 
Is this possible? If it wasn't done manually, and was instead done via code, how could it be called cold storage?

If there was a supernode on P2Pool, that had 51% of p2pool's network power and p2pool itself had 100% of total bitcoin hashing power, miners could switch to other public nodes (or their own) with absolutely no change in variance or payout schedule.
100% of mining power through p2pool would mean every single block was split between all bitcoin miners, rather than it being a pure contest to get the whole block for yourself.
That being said, having a lonely node if p2pool was that big would mean very few payments, so hybrid nodes or supernodes would likely become a thing.
The bitcoin block chain is a proof of solution chain. The p2pool share chain is a proof of effort chain.

It's probably more like this:
How can we get the most out of our existing tax framework?
1) Many Bitcoins are hoarded for long term gain, so capital gains is a great way to tax it.
2) Bitcoins are simultaneously *used* in the same way as fiat money (or as close as possible without actually being it), so anyone having anything to do with it in the short-term, can be treated and taxed like any other "money transmitter". 
It's the almost simultaneous part that makes it messy. We don't use houses or gold to buy bread, for example.

I don't mind if you link it at all - the more people who donate the better for p2pool.
From what I read, it works like this:
There's a donation amount and a cutoff amount. P2Pool uses the most recent 24 hour period to calculate everyone's contribution as a percentage of the total, using the valid shares they've submitted.
It then splits the donation amount between every valid miner, according to percentage contribution, and anyone who's payment would be less than the cutoff gets grouped up into a lottery pool. It then randomly assigns the pool to one of the miners, with each miner getting a chance to win based on their contribution again.
So when people donate, if they make the cutoff as low as possible, more people will get a reward (less will be grouped up in the lottery pool). You can't make it too low, though, otherwise there will be tons of dust payments everywhere. I've put a recommended cutoff of 0.0001 btc, but really it depends on how much is being donated too, since if that's more more people will be higher than the cutoff too.

I've always thought that MtGox were more incompetent, than evil. As in, they just genuinely suck at customer service, thinking that they're doing the right thing. 
I think they're actually going to try and patch the transaction ID bug in their system, and aren't interested in short selling to make back any coins they may have lost. It makes more sense that they wanted to stop bitcoin withdrawals because they wanted to be certain coins were going to the intended recipient, rather than manipulating the market to cover any losses they may have had because of it. They make enormous amounts of money as an exchange, and I don't think they would piss that away deliberately...it's just not their style.

Something I wondered, is would you have to use a different read/write key pair to sign messages to your first one (that you used to read messages), or is there a way you can use the same write/read key pair for both purposes?
On the surface using the same key-pair doesn't make sense, because if you're giving your write key out in the first version, you don't ever want anyone to have your read key...but is the some special way around that?
How does one prove they have the write key when they're giving everyone their read key?

P2pool donations have been rising the last few days, and that's definitely something non-miners can do to help the situation. So far 3.5219 btc have been donated through the tool I wrote about 3 weeks ago ( which means with the 17 blocks mined since then, there's been a 0.82% bonus in p2pool payouts, plus other donations from people not using the tool (about enough to push it past 1% bonus). 
Of course more hashpower on p2pool means a lower donation effect, but the resulting lower variance has its own rewards.
During the last bout, I noticed a fair rise in hashpower on my p2pool node ( but due to lower luck for the week following, a lot of miners left for greener pastures, only to miss 7-8 blocks within 3 days a week later. If you're going to mine on P2Pool, make the decision to mine on it for a few months to get the most value for your hardware.
Ultimately, it doesn't matter which pool you mine with, because your constant hashrate will dictate your general return over time, unless you're pool hopping hoping to catch variance.

As with anything in a marketplace, there has to be some utility for a product to actually become 'successful' from the instigators perspective. 
If bitcoin initiators want a mass-audience for bitcoins, the product, then the mass-market has to have some particular problem solved by using them, and it has to be obvious to them why it is better than anything else. No one really had to convince people to use facebook or twitter, because they were just obviously better at their respective tasks than email and megaphones. No one needs to persuade anyone to use bitcoins if they are inherently more useful or solving a real problem that the masses face. Sure bitcoins have lots of pros, but what are bitcoins uniquely the best at by a long margin, that everyone needs?
Taking this idea that fiat is worthless and govts and banks are all going to go away is counter-productive. If the fiat system collapses of its own accord, and bitcoins are a working alternative, *then* it will surely catapult in usage like never before seen. That's a pretty big if, though, considering banking history, and not what I would ever bet anything significant on. It's not the answer that I think many of you are looking for, because it depends on something that may not even happen.
The one solid utility that I have personally experienced with bitcoins is the ease and speed of international digital transactions. After buying a few things from the humble store with bitcoins, I didn't have to do any mental (or physical) arithmetic to figure out how much I was actually going to pay in my local currency, nor did I have to wait for my bank's cc statement to finally reflect the true price after spot conversion and all that. The deal was done within seconds, and it was glorious. It was genuinely more convenient to pay with bitcoins than it was to open up my wallet and fish out my credit card, type all the numbers in, and so on. The bitcoin transaction was a few clicks and maybe a couple key presses. Now, whenever I have to renew an online service I look for a bitcoin option because it is faster. I can re-purchase bitcoins once a month or w/e easily enough, and I'm willing to do that, just as I spend time budgeting finances monthly, because that's a known, planned period. Day to day, I just want it to be as convenient as possible.
Bitcoin introduces some problems, too, which have already been solved by the fiat system. One of the biggest problems I have with it is accounting. If I use it for business expenses, it gets a lot more complicated...money doesn't necessarily go back to the same account, and as far as I know, it's not easy to have multiple segregated wallets on my pc (I know it's possible, just not easy for mainstream). Nor is it easy to allow multiple people to access different wallets securely, that is still not hosted by a 3rd party. The risk of theft is also enormous, and grows with each accessing party. Commerce depends on good accounting, and bitcoins don't have it yet, so while bitcoin has it's strengths, its weaknesses are still off-putting in many ways. I'm confident it will mature in time, though. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 01:13:18
That appears to be an oxymoron to me, and doesn't follow logically. Trust might be expensive to build, but trustless is even more expensive. With bitcoin the cost is distributed as a side-effect of mass audience profit seeking.
Bitcoins do allow cheap transfers, but not *because* it's trustless. That's just a coincidence.
EDIT: I've just thought of this, but it's probably cheap because the supply of transaction space is huge compared to the current demand. If the demand for transactions go way up, and the block kb limit isn't increased, transfers will no longer be "cheap".

Maybe a bug in the software that never actually checked the cold-wallet balances on the blockchain, and only just an internal balance could cause this.
If the hot wallet is double spending but the software thinks it isn't, the software might think there's more in the cold wallet (if it doesn't check) than is actually in there.
Another check should have looked to see if the hot wallet was requesting funds from the cold wallet when it still had a balance. Anyone looking at the hot wallet's reported balance (by software, not wallet.dat) would just see it rise and rise and rise until it reached the cold wallet's balance, but the wallet.dat file would say something completely different. 
This makes me think it's not possible that this actually happened, unless a lot of manual ignoring has been going on.

That's a great idea, and I'll definitely add that feature.

I think I understand what you're saying, but I believe outputs are the issue here, no? Unless you mean from the miners's perspective...then yes, inputs are the problem.
Going by outputs:
So 1KB = 0.00001 btc transaction fee, which can hold 29 outputs (34B each), so each output costs 0.00000034 btc...and the minimum cutoff would be approx 0.000001 btc
Going by inputs (on donation receiver's end):
1KB = 0.00001 btc transaction fee, which can hold 6 inputs (150B each), so each input costs 0.00000166 btc...and the minimum cutoff should then be approx 0.000003 btc. 
Are either of these on the right track? Which should I be considering? Currently my minimum is 0.000001 btc, and perhaps I should make it 0.000003 btc?

Just a note to miners who are going to try using p2pool:
Commit to doing it for at least a week, because it takes up to 3 days to fully establish your hashpower by the network. P2Pool works on a 3 day conveyor belt system, and payouts are based on how many shares you have on the conveyor belt when a block is found. As old ones drop off you'll generally earn new ones at the start if your hashpower is consistent.
This also means when you stop mining on p2pool, you'll have shares on the conveyor belt for 3 days, so you'll get some portion of payments until they all drop off too.
P2Pool has had some bad luck this last few days (no blocks), so it's a great time to jump on board to increase its hashpower. A lot of people have been jumping on because of the GHash fiasco, and last thing we want is for everyone to be turned off now because of no payments!

Ultimately you should get roughly the same btc per hashpower no matter which pool you're with, but the problem with being a smaller miner is that the difficulty just keeps rising when you may not even find a p2pool block before difficulty changes. Centralized pools who make trickle payments will always be more attractive to smaller miners for this reason. 
If the larger miners mine via p2pool, though, that's a lot of power not going to central hands.

I've found the technical aspects are what turn a lot of people off bitcoins (eg understanding cryptography), but once you actually make the effort to read the whitepaper and understand the actual process, you can see for yourself how genius it is for verifying information (this is the anti-forgery part).
It has it's flaws and vulnerabilities, and it has a lot of resistance being accepted by the world at large as a *currency*, but the one thing it does well, it does extremely well - public trustless verification (the blockchain). Bitcoins as a currency is secondary to the blockchain. This blockchain can be used for a hell of a lot of things other than currency, and the currency can be seen as an *application* of blockchain technology. It just so happened that at the time satoshi thought all this up, the world was going through its first global financial crisis and fiat was looking particularly treacherous, so currency was an interesting first use case.

I wonder the same thing. Maybe it's a touch too hard to set up? Of course one could just join one of the hundreds of nodes...so maybe the variance is a bit too uncomfortable?
I've even got a 20% bonus payout on my p2pool node this month, with very little interest. I just don't get why. If you earn 1btc before fee from p2pool, you'll get 0.9btc straight to your bitcoin address (as generated), plus 0.3 bitcoins worth of devcoins to your devcoin address, which are easy enough to convert to btc at vircurex/cryptsy. I made this arrangement to test a new devcoin client under development, but so far the hashpower sent to the node has been light at best. [Link to pool for anyone interested](
Maybe it would be more attractive if I just paid out the bonus in bitcoins? I dunno, but I just don't get why people don't like hashing on p2pool for too long.

The problem has always been it's up to the miner that finds a block to include whichever transactions they want, no matter what minimum fee the devs set. Others check the hash to see if it's legit, and if there are two, takes the longest chain (most transactions).
Lower fees is one thing, but miners seeking profit is another. The true cost of distributed payment processing will reach a free market equilibrium at some point, and this change better allows it to be found.

I'd be interested to hear why that is.
Blizzard tried a real money auction house with Diablo III, and scrapped it after they discovered it hurt their game (community) more than helped it, for a number of reasons:
Itemization meant good drops had to be rare, and then players were basically forced to play forever, or pay for it.
Money became the motivator while playing, instead of fun, something going against the general nature of games.
It killed the core gameplay: Kill monsters to get loot, and many players were turned off by this, and stopped playing.
Traditional MMOs are very much loot oriented in the same way. Why would adding a real world money supply make it more fun?
EVE online I can understand, but that's one of the rare examples it would actually add something rather than take away (it's already high risk high reward gameplay).

It is handy, although you still have to trust that I'm not ninjaing the coins a little :). I try to be as transparent as I can with it (stats / recent donations etc on the page), and I'll have an API up soonish where people can draw the whole database to create donations from their own node front-ends, or double check whatever they need to.
It's been running fairly smoothly the last few days so things are looking good. I'm sorry not everyone will get donations, but there's a lower limit on how useful donations will be because of the transaction fees. 0.01 btc minimum donation is just because at default cutoff it's going out to 350+ miners, which is $0.13 on average (lowest I've seen was 133 bits). 
People can donate down to 0.000001 cutoff, which is less than transaction fee. I'm still not sure how well that's going to work out. I pay the fees on my end out of tips, but when when it gets to miners, a lot of dust payments need to be re-jiggled manually to avoid excessive fees when they then go on to send it out. Still trying to find the right balance.

* CEO resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation
All the other rumors are just that. Even the leaked document looked like it was written by a 14 year old. No actual sources have come into the open to say anything. Other exchanges got together to protect their own exchanges, with claims that have yet to be substantiated.

Also,  is paying out a bonus of 20% on what you earn through p2pool at the moment (rest of June). It's in an alt coin (devcoin), but it's still basically a *negative* fee pool. The only real downside is it's a p2pool node backend, so only a block or so a day is found.

So you have limit orders and market orders. As others have explained limit orders include the most you'll pay, or cheapest you'll sell (the limit). 
A limit sell of 100k doge for 200 satoshis, means if I get 200 satoshis for all of those I'll be happy, no less.
A limit buy of 100k doge for 150 satoshis, means I will only pay 150 satoshis for all those doge.
So those enter the order books which you can view on most exchanges.
Someone else comes along, and if their "cheapest acceptable" or "most I'll pay" figures (sell/buy limits) overlap existing orders, the exchange will trade. I believe the existing (older) order gets the price indicated first, so even if you say "I'll buy 1m doge up to 300 satoshis", you'll  pay 200 for that 100k order above, then whatever is between that and 300 satoshis that fills a 1m doge order.
The other order is a market order, which is basically saying "I want 1m doge, just give me whatever price you can", and it automatically fills up to  your order amount, no matter the price.

Hold on, the announcement about "we've fixed the problem and will have it running soon" was made on feb 17:

Today is a week or so after that announcement, and the servers don't vanish off the face of the earth, but go "blank", indicating something is being updated or tested non-live (but for some reason everything else needs to be in stasis to test properly). 
There happens to be an unverified (by anyone actually important) document foretelling of everything shutting down, coinciding with this morning too, and everyone thinks insolvency is a matter of fact. Just because a bunch of competitors throw MtGox in the fire, it's assumed they all talk to each other and tell each other the financial details of a private company. I don't think so.
As far as all this is concerned, MtGox isn't insolvent or bankrupt or shutting down or anything unless someone at MtGox says so, or there is a filing for chapter 11.

I've added the CEO two, thanks.
Regarding twitter, we're only speculating on why it shut down. We don't even know the real reason he left the Bitcoin Foundation. It could be because they're insolvent, but it could also be because he buckled to public pressure to resign.
I remember when the first super crash happened at the $32 ATH a couple years ago. After a couple weeks the market was doing its thing, then bam, price hit $0.01 and then the site went down for about a week. Lots of speculation on what happened, similar to what's going on now, and MtGox eventually announced that they had been hacked and someone had sold lots of coins (I think it was to himself, but I can't remember the details now) and tried to send them out. During that dark time they rolled back the server transactions to just before it happened, applied a withdraw limit to all accounts, then carried on. Them having a PR shutdown is not unusual. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:36:33
I think it's because p2pool has a higher variance than centralized pools, but I'm not 100% sure why the uptake is so low. It only pays whenever a block is found, and it can be a few days between them sometimes. I get the impression this turns people off, because the difficulty keeps rising whether they find blocks or not. This effect would be diminished if it can get a good portion of the network rate (15-20%), but getting to that stage is hard. 
The up side to p2pool is no one node is in control, and people can mine on any node to get credit across the whole network. People don't need to mine on my node in particular, it's just one among many.
@_date: 2014-06-14 04:26:14
It's not miners who should donate to support the network, they're already inadvertently doing that in the pursuit of mining profit. It's everyone else who isn't a miner (businesses, hodlers) who should be donating to increase incentives for the types of miners that they want. They have the power to influence the miner by simply offering more money.
P2Pool has a built in donation ability, which was hard to get at for non-miners, until now:  This particular tool is only a few days old, but P2Pool miners have been commenting how great it is to see these little trickles come in (reducing their worry over variance ever so slightly), and non-technical types have a real way to actually influence the mining market. Merge mining is nice, and we're talking roughly about a 1% increase in total mining reward from it, and is pretty easy to implement with p2pool but it hasn't been enough. Donations add to this, and so far 1.132 bitcoins have been donated using the tool which is about the same payout as what merged mining would do. Join a node with merged mining enabled (or make your own) and you get a bonus on two fronts. Should more businesses and holders become aware they can influence the market with regular donations (small donations en masse over time), the bonus rate should increase enough to influence larger miners without trying to convince them on intellectual merits. 
Both sides win with this arrangement, businesses/holders can pay 1% a week (or whatever they decide) for blockchain insurance, which is extremely important to them, while miners get a faster ROI, which is what's important to them. It's a market derived solution.

Which means gox still has all the coins.
Further to this, say only 200k bitcoins were actually ever sent to gox, and $20M.
Changing numbers in an account would not change the actual btc or cash balances, only who owns what. If one entity gave themselves a credit of $20M on the system, bought all the bitcoins for that much, then withdrew, then there would be evidence on the blockchain, and from mtgox's wallets. The same applies to cash, and if cash is withdrawn, there should be a record of who received it. If a hacker verified accounts with false information, and withdrew bitcoins, they could very well all be gone.

At some point, mining hardware will slam itself hard into physics, and the price of electricity. If the price is dropping now because new hardware is coming out, it just means that people buying coins now are investing in miners.

Rather than a bail-out, a round of investment would make more sense. There has to be some return for people putting their coins in just to maintain a status quo. 
Investors would be investing in a new ceo/team and deciding the value of any goodwill they still have (customers, position, etc). If they're willing to pay $200m odd for the company in its current state, rather than start from scratch themselves, they'll consider it. 
Or just start one themselves and let it die.

I wasn't denying there wouldn't be enough, that's obvious. 
What doesn't seem to be so obvious is that it's a scenario that will never happen. Not because there isn't enough money, but because loans aren't all called up at once. The $ creators know it's impossible, and that is not their goal.
In this hypothetical scenario where we want to kill all money, for whatever reason, and we don't do it immediately, it can still be done. All the economy has to do is provide the value of money plus interest in goods or services that are not money.

For some reason I thought the public key was 'different' to the private key because it was so much smaller.

Just an offhand thing you can do - I'm looking for miners big or small to join my p2pool node ([here]( and I'm paying out 10,000 devcoins per day split by hash power. At the moment you'd be getting about 5% of that, plus I might increase it soon. It's a 0% fee bitcoin mining pool which I make payouts through by merge-mining alt coins. At the moment I just need hash power, big or small. If you're interested, head on over and check it out.
Soon I'll look into scrypt merge-mining, and if it's a thing you can hop over to that one when it's available and get better income.
Alternatively you can do as others suggest and join a scrypt mining pool.

Yep, Blisterpool is just another p2pool node. As the operator, I don't mind people using it if they don't want to set up their own p2pool node (plus there are side perks), but overall the more nodes the better.
On this node I set up a more elaborate front-end to give bonuses for the devcoin client testing that I'm doing, unrelated to bitcoin/p2pool except for the merge-mining part. The donate tool was purely to get people using p2pool more, on their own or public nodes, for the sake of decentralization.

It would be good, but it's a little tricky. I've got the tool connected to my regular web-server, and it talks to the p2pool node only once (to get the list of miners). The rest is all scripting and databasing to check for donations, etc...and I'm not really sure how to translate it into something useful for all nodes.
Do you run a front end (port 80) or use p2pool's built in? If it's the former, I could clean up a few of the workhorse scripts and put them on github (happy to do), but you'd still have to wire them up yourself.

Interesting idea.
Regarding the payment forwarding, wouldn't all the people in the chain want a cut of the coins moving through? 
ie where is the webshop's profit in your example?
Would it not be equally as simple to have margin rules? ie for every btc that goes through processing for this particular purchase, the webshop gets 40%, distributor gets 30%, farmer gets 30% (or something)? When companies register with the processor, they then have the option of whoever they supply to pay them through that, and a rule can be setup to distribute accordingly.
Otherwise...I don't really understand how everyone gets paid in your example...could you elaborate?

They're not "gone" as in "gone forever". They're allegedly "gone" as it not in MtGox's wallets.

It's inevitable though. There's no such thing as a free lunch, and even here, there is a real cost in resources of securing the network and finding a block. If the fees keep rising, it's because the demand for transaction space is outstripping the supply. 
The difference between bitcoins and Credit companies, is that the free market decides what that cost of production is on a global scale, not a board of directors.

Buying hashpower and joining the network is a good option. Get involved!
If don't want to get technical, though, you can also send regular donations to p2pool miners directly, to further encourage miners to move over. You can do this through a bitcoind/p2pool command if you have them running, or by using a donation tool such as:  If you wanted to donate something like $200, you could either put it as a large donation (which is nice for current miners), or spread it out over 10 donations for the next 10 weeks through the tool. Every p2pool miner feels good seeing a donation come in no matter how small. Dopamine is a powerful motivator to stay on p2pool, and these small payments have an impact. 
Also, encouraging any bitcoin businesses you know to join the "1% for decentralization" club would do wonders for p2pool incentive. This is where they donate 1% of their weekly bitcoin profits to p2pool (either manually or through the tool above), and help increase incentives for p2pool mining that way. 
There's a working banner they can advertise their generosity in this reddit post:  direct banner link: 
P2pool's huge obstacle at the moment is variance, it just takes too long to get a block at the moment. Petamine joining p2pool would be amazing, bringing it to at least one block a day.
For those who want to examine the tool more, I've put the workhorse files up on github:  and I'll update it when I've added an api (so p2pool operaters / businesses can put it on their own frontends)

I agree, it doesn't explain missing bitcoins.
One possibility is that willy added fake dollars to their account, bought the bitcoins, then withdrew them using falsified verification information.
The blockchain should show all of that money leaving gox, though. In fact, if someone got a hold of every wallet gox has ever used, they should all tally to show the real balance as 200k. I don't know how the accounting system could have thought it had more than that, unless bitcoin balances were also added. The btc withdrawals getting stuck could only happen if btc balances on accounts were added without real coins, and the real coins were removed, in which case again the system could be reporting anything at all. 
If those coins are shown to enter gox, and not shown to leave, then gox still has them. At this point, the truth lies in getting our hands on those wallets and their transactions.

Good luck in your search for a solution, and remember that while people are certainly angry about losing money, including myself, whatever gag order you're under is magnifying it ten-fold.

I've had to manually upload those (a lot of server related stuff had to be removed), and I've been working on it since then, just fixing bugs and adding a few features, but the core is the same. I'll do another update after I've implemented the api.
What happens with the donation is you tell p2pool the amount and cutoff, and it just gives you a list of addresses and the amounts they should get, based on their shares contributed in the last 24 hours. The cutoff is the minimum payment a miner can receive, and anyone who falls under that amount gets put into a pool with all the payouts below that amount. All miners below the cutoff get a chance to win that entire pool based on their contribution (hashpower I think, but could be block-shares), so it's all paid out.

You can also add a refund address in case things go awry, as well as an email address for record keeping / notifications.
It will generate an address to send your donation to, and once it's confirmed (3 confirmations), it'll send the payment out as requested. I've tested it myself already, and this is the resulting page: 
Here's one that's currently in progress: 
To check that I'm not secretly keeping funds myself, you can click the link to blockchain.info for the donating address in the status page, and follow the outputs, they should all go to p2pool miner addresses (which you can tell from the fact that other payments are all generated), except the one that bitcoind creates for leftovers (the tip). 
I may still have to iron out a bug or two, but it should be good to go.

How about if you had one side with a man in a nice suit, expensive watch walking down, and the other where a looks a bit poor, missing teeth, probably a drug addict? Both white.
Just kidding, you'll get robbed either way. The one on the left will sell you a mortgage, then cross the road and sell the drug addict a mortgage too. Then he'll bundle them together and sell them to someone else saying they're totally safe, taking a huge profit. When the poor guy can't afford his mortgage because you didn't walk on his side and couldn't be robbed him, the economy collapses and the purchasing power of all the dollars in your savings account is halved. The one on the right is just more up front about it.

No that's not actually true. What it means is that the borrower has to give $10 extra value back to the banker. 
borrow $1000, owe $1010.
what am I going to do with the $1000? Hopefully invest in some trade tools (or whatever). Conduct trade...earn $1000, give that back to the banker.
Now what? I still owe $10. But I still have my trade tools. Charge the banker $10 to fix his tap or whatever, banker doesn't have any cash because it's all gone...but technically still has $10 in assets for that loan he created. I take that instead, money all gone.
This is obviously ultra simplified but it is essentially how it works.
@_date: 2017-02-26 00:57:52
Yeah, that is exactly why it is better for trading. You have no incentive to hold onto cash, and incentive to trade it for assets or consumables.
With fiat, it's a game of hot potato. A suitable cryptocurrency replacement for cash should be similar.

Trend is hard to really gauge, it changes so much during the year.
From tradeblock, using 11 day average between difficulty adjustments:
30 day: 27% -&gt; 9.9% increase per difficulty change
60 day: 77% -&gt; 14.1% increase per difficulty change
90 day: 128% -&gt; 15.6% increase per difficulty change
But of course that's assuming tradeblock's calculations take the compounding into consideration.
1 year ago exactly, difficulty was 67,750,000, so increase of raw difficulty this year has been 41,700%, which is a roughly 20% increase per difficulty change over 33 changes. I'd say that's a fairly safe number to use.

Not quite.
If all debt was paid off, and no new loans were taken out, there would be massive deflation, because money *would* be destroyed. Fiat is destroyed when a loan is paid off.
It just so happens, that loans are created faster than they're paid off, and that is considered growing the economy.

Something still doesn't sound right about this. What are the specs of the chip? Have they been released?
If they do a p2pool style payout (multiple addresses included in the generation transaction), is there a hard limit on how many addresses can be included? I've not heard of one, but if we're talking millions of devices using the same network, there could be a problem here.
If they have to apply any restrictions at all (eg implement share system like p2pool), then difficulty rises will guarantee chips become useless within a year. A lot rides on them being able to add unlimited addresses in generation. Is this even possible?

Not just electricity companies - all utilities would matter. Those companies still have to buy equipment, pay labour and so on, and while they might keep profit in btc, they still have expenses they'll have to convert to cash.

Could have just sent it to any other exchanges, cashed out, etc.
As far as MtGox was concerned (if this is all true), the coins were legitimately sent out to normal customers - assuming lots of stolen identities. The thief could then have either stashed them away or cashed them out in all the many ways people can.
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:45:27
Yes, it is a hope. I appreciate your response.
I believe the real reason everyday people are buggered, is that while the mechanisms of capitalism reward those who own productive assets (non-residential), they are only a tiny portion of the population. 
The 'trickle down' effect was supposed to ensure the masses would get their cut enough to pay down their personal debts, but there are only so many suits, shoes, coffees, etc, that the actual asset owners need to buy. What do they do with the rest of their money?
They're actually in a bad situation where they either spend their huge actual cash income on more assets, exacerbating the problem, or hoard it, making it harder for everyone else to earn it off them to pay back their own loans. The real problem is that the small business has been crushed and the vast majority of people would rather have a degree and a job, with control of who gets what resting largely on those who actually own assets. 
QE just keeps it running a little bit longer, but the money will always funnel to the asset owners, and then what? The system will need more money. This isn't a problem of interest, it's a problem of distribution of ownership among the population. Fix that, and the interest problem goes away.

I agree, bitcoin has all the incentives of being a hoarded for value coin rather than a trade coin.
It's not great as a trading coin because it's more valuable holding on to it than getting rid of it.
Cash is still way better than bitcoin for trading stuff. There could be a cryptocurrency that is better for trading but as the other advantages of crypto - no central reserve set interest rate, strong anti-forgery, trustless - but it doesn't exist yet as far as I know.

Fiat has inflation because it's better for the economy for you not to hold on to cash for too long. Ironically, you buying bitcoins with your fiat is exactly what the economy wants. It doesn't want you to hold on to your cash, because cash was created in a loan, and that money needs to be free in the economy so it can be earned back to pay down those loans, and create new ones. 
Yes, buy bitcoins because you don't like inflation, but you should also be buying all kinds of assets. Bitcoin is a high risk asset, there other income producing assets that you might also consider. It's not so much yay bitcoin as it is woe fiat, and *all* assets are woe fiat.

The fact that they trade off exchanges just means the *volume* on exchanges is less than it should be. Nothing more. The price is still truly reflective of demand.
What's really happening: Big buyers and sellers don't want the risk and hassle of dealing with exchanges. Slippage, bankruptcy, etc. Someone is willing to be a middle man, to either absorb the risk themselves (charge higher than market rate), or match them with other sellers for a fee.
If the buyers want more bitcoins than are available "off exchange", where do you think the brokers are going to get the coins from? By settling via exchanges, the volume has moved off the books, but the supply/demand effect is still at work.
It seems like the article writer is wishing the price would go to 100k/coin already, because he expects the big buyers to go and make market orders like noobs. They're not noobs, which is why they're making use of low-risk high-trust brokerage services.

Wow...this guy was the worst kind of dodgy.
What I've learned from this AMA:
- He had 1 personal bank account, which MTGox customers paid fiat directly into. There was no separation of company and personal funds.
- His idea of a cold wallet was a wallet on another internet connected computer only he had access to.
- It was estimated that he was spending more on "shit" (outgoings) than MtGox was bringing in in trading profits. The extra expenses were paid for by customer deposits. This is where all the missing fiat went. He literally spent it when he shouldn't have. There is no way that this would have been stolen in the same way coins could have been. Banks don't work that way.
- All of his code was kept in a database, on the production server, with no pre-production setup, or version control. Every code change was immediately live on the the exchange (holy fucking shit).
- He never let anyone else see his shitty backend to stop anyone ever truly understanding his shenanigans. 
- He possibly manipulated the price to make people pay more for bitcoins than they should, pocketing the difference for either personal profit, or to reduce outstanding liability for the money he stole from customers.
- He possibly still has full control of all the coins actually deposited (not 850k) and released 200k to get people off his trail. Like a fucking gecko. I'll bet he still has 200k more hidden away somewhere.

yes, after the initial painful period, the difficulty will adjust to suit the new network hash rate, to maintain 10 minute blocks. IIRC it was around 2016 blocks per change.
If the network dropped to 25% hashpower, it'll take at most 2 months to get back to regular speed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:23:31
The fees are there for convenience. You can get the cheapest rates if you're willing to make an effort to join the biggest exchanges you can in your currency, deal with all the verification biz, manually transfer cash to the exchange weekly, put in either a market order (just buy now) or a limit order and wait for a better rate (which you may not get), then transfer it out to your own wallet.
If you're willing to do all that (which honestly isn't that hard once you figure it out), you'll only pay around 0.5% for the exchange fee plus any bank transfer fees you might have. If you don't really want to think about it just pay the up to 10% premium to have someone else do it for you.

This is actually true. I'm not a big fan of BCH over BTC, but there is no doubt that miners will follow the money. That's the point.
Once BCH's difficulty becomes comparable to BTCs, the real difference in profitability will come from the market price. That's what's going to decide which will end up the stronger coin - simple demand for btc vs bch. The miners should just act rationally.
This isn't a normal alt-coin...people had both coins on the split. People were able to sell one for the other to double down, and that is their choice too.

Of course it does. The point is that there are many ways to reduce congestion, each with different side effects.
Adding lanes has diminishing returns. To get the same improvement in congestion for a 16 lane highway, as going from 1 lane to 2 lanes, you'd have to go from 16 to 32+. 
Fitting more occupants in the vehicles is another way of dealing with the issue, and that works no matter how many lanes you have. Downside is stuff takes longer (you're at the bus driver's whim)

Whether it's right or wrong, that's basically what governments are incentivized to do themselves. When people spend, trade happens, which means taxes happen either through sales or income tax. Governments definitely want as much trade to happen as possible, to maximize taxes and their economic power. It also makes them look better (GDP). 
The flip side of this is that when people are spending rather than saving, producers know what people want by what they are buying. Yes you have to produce something in order for someone to buy it, but the driving mechanism is earning the most money. Producers make all sorts of things, but not all will be successful (just ask in how many things people tried before one took off). They know it's not successful when people don't buy it, not when they produce it.
When a lot of people want something, its price goes up if the supply doesn't change. This is a signal for manufacturers to start making more of that thing. Hiring people, to make it too.
Edit: Equity is something else...it's not cash, it's ownership. People save money so they can either stop working, or buy expensive things which will generate cash for them (assets).

I tried to setup a DAC for a bounty once. All of it was entirely feasible except for one crippling part. No domain registrar or ISP was willing to open up a pure bitcoin payment API. 
There are many that "accepted bitcoins as payments", but they all required you to basically pay through bitpay or the like, requiring human intervention. No one did it natively, enough so that a DAC could talk to the isp, ask for any outstanding invoices, get given an address to pay to, and then pay it. 
It could be setup to pay via bitpay, but if bitpay change their page the DAC wouldn't know how to handle it, and it will eventually be reallocated.
The conclusion was that it had 3 ways of going forward. Wait for a registrar to have a full bitcoin invoice/api system, setup a registrar that can do all that (maybe that could be the first DAC?), or host a domain via namecoin (so 0.01% of the population would ever see it).

Technically with bitcoins a government, if it were so inclined, could enact a law which stated that bitcoins that could be proven stolen, could be returned to the owner no matter who was now the current bag-holder. There are already property laws against receiving stolen goods.
If someone reports their bitcoins as stolen, and proved ownership via a signed transaction with the private key, someone caught with a receiving address who could not prove how they got them legitimately (through a sale or legit trade somehow), could be forced to return them. 
You can't prove that with cash unless they're marked in some way, as far as I know.

Because, honestly, bitcoin isn't a very good trade token, and is a very good savings token.
Fiat is inflationary...it *purposely* loses value over time. Why? Because economists figured out that if people were paid in something that loses value, they're more likely to trade it for something that doesn't. This means a more efficient, stronger economy because people spend more. What they're really doing is trading those tokens back for goods or other forms of ownership (investments). 
The bad thing about this is that people who didn't really understand what was happening, and just saved all their money in the bank, had their purchasing power eroded over time. They should have traded them in for better things like precious metals if they wanted to save. Bitcoins are deflationary, every bit as secure as fiat, and are the equivalent of digital gold. They provide the other side of money, which is something that holds long term value, which fiat does not.
The only way that bitcoin can work as a trade currency, better than something we already have, is the lightning network. I predict that no one will use a fiat style inflationary crypto long term, because the only people that advantages are the ones who issue it. They get to print and spend the money first. This can work in a government situation, but not in others without an insane amount of trust.
With the lightning network, you're trading IOUs on your bitcoin with nodes as middlemen. This is similar to the old fiat system that was backed by gold or silver. That will be more useful, but only if it's better than the tap and go thing you get these days from the cc companies. It doesn't just have to be as good to get people to actually use it, it has to be better. 
Bitcoins' true value is in that you don't have to trust any government, and it's excellent for long-term savings, because you don't have to carry heavy gold or whatever around.

They can start by informing the current MtGox bankruptcy trustee that the accounts should be re-evaluated when it comes to distribution, instead of giving the guy who knowingly committed fraud all the excess value after giving creditors $450 per coin they had on the exchange.
For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, in order to submit a claim on the 202k bitcoins still in possession, you had to agree to a $480 valuation per btc. Years later, the coins are now worth 10x that, but creditors (people who had btc on there) are by law only owed $480 per btc. Mt Gox can basically pay everyone off at that low, low price, and the owner, who used the exchange as his own piggy bank, lots btc in hacks, had no idea how many bitcoins he actually had, and disclosed NONE of it until now, could walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. In the meantime, people have still lost 600k bitcoins. The situation is obscene.

Some people seem to be confused about how this is working, so this is what I've discovered while putting my claim through:
1) The trustees don't care about coins, and probably don't want to deal with them. They collect all the monies, convert it to JPY and store it in an account. 
2) They then collect all the bitcoins and store them wherever, and multiplies the total amount by approx current market value.
** note this isn't clear, but they must expect a lot of people to want bitcoins back, so they won't have to actually sell them on the open market (disaster). 
3) They add the two together, minus all the bankruptcy expenses. This is the total amount they consider, and we will call, "Distributable Assets" (in JPY).
4) They then get all the claims in (by May 29, 2015 - you have 5 weeks to file your claim), sort out who looks legit, drop the rest, and tally up who can prove they owned that account by converting everything to JPY and adding it up. They add 6% interest PA on your value (cash or bitcoins converted to JPY in April 2014). We'll call this "Total Approved Claims".
5) If you can prove your claim, you can work out how much you'll get like this:
(My account value / Total Approved Claims) * Distributable Assets = your JPY amount back, give or take. 
6) If you want to be paid in JPY, submit your claim through claims.mtgox.com either online, or "offline" - that is download and print the form from mtgox, fill it in, and post it to them by end of May 2015. Online you need to know your mtgox password etc.
If you want to be paid in Bitcoins, sign up to Kraken, verify up to tier 2 (name/address/etc, no passports), and submit the claim through them (it takes you to the mtgox page, where you login to mtgox, then click the "send me back to kraken link"). You will either get JPY to your kraken account, or btc at current market price based on your original JPY claim figure. This bit isn't so clear.

It's interesting, but I still don't get how it's supposed to work.
So as a shopkeeper/dev, you buy this device, and set it up to 'sell' an mp3 of you shagging a sheep. It has a webserver, so presumably you can host your own site on there, but then what's the point of the CLI for the marketplace?

My real wallet doubles as my honeypot wallet because I'm poor.
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:37:40
ok, so key points from the write up:
- generate coins because of privacy. Each device has new coins, which means your identity cannot be linked to someone else (who say, stole the bitcoins they sold you).
- it's a dev-starter-kit, not a mass-produced-in-every-device-for-pennies product.
- "Link unforgeable bitcoin private keys with biometric identification" - no more logins, your device buys the stuff on your behalf, using its newly minted coins. It owns the rights to digital goods.
The one difficulty I see is that you're still gonna need more bitcoins than what this thing is producing to consume anything. Even if the price rises, the hashrate will rise with it, and this device's production power is going to drop. You could mitigate privacy issues by buying proper miners and transferring those coins to the device, I suppose.

@_date: 2015-09-18 01:17:22
Is it possible, that this problem is just not elegantly solvable?
In any transaction, there has to be some level of trust or faith in at least one of the parties. Third party intervention is simply someone that both trading parties trust, if they don't each other (so they're still trusting *someone*).
You can add as many sigs as you like to this, but perhaps the problem is that two things cannot happen simultaneously in all time frames. Maybe it's a law, and all we can deal with are workarounds that have the lowest risk.

This is the nature of bubbles in tiny markets. People bought in at $32, and it went down to $2. They could have bought 16 times the bitcoins if they'd waited six months. 
Then again, if they'd waited another year and a half they would have only been able to buy 1/8th as much, and for a time, 1/37th as much.
One thing is certain: fiat will always inflate. It is in its nature. Bitcoins will inflate for a few years then have a lower inflation rate than fiat, until it has no inflation rate at all. As long as the core technology remains unflawed, and if the only reason to buy bitcoins is to hedge against fiat inflation (as a store of value), there is a huge likelihood their value will rise against fiat. This will always be true.

Yeah and that's one of the few reasons why it sucks as a replacement for fiat. The best economies trade, and when you have something you don't want (fiat), you're more likely to spend it. Just think about how you buy bitcoin. The fiat you used to buy it isn't destroyed...it's  just in someone else's hands now. The fiat *served its purpose*.

The private key acts as an identity, yes, but the transaction history is the relationship. Minting coins mean there are no possible pre-existing relationships. A company couldn't boycott another company by blocking all coins coming from a known public address, for example.
To your other points, yes all of this can be done with different hardware already. I think 21.co are just trying to integrate it. A bit like how phones + camera turned into smartphones. Like anything, they'll be judged by how useful and easy to use it ends up being.

People's beliefs are influenced in this order:
- personal experience
- peer pressure
- intellectual understanding
If you want to change someone's mind about bitcoins, give them a personal experience they can draw on. It is more powerful than what the news, or teacher, or anyone else says (peer-pressure).
Ask them for an address and offer to them some to play with. Show them where they can spend it (send enough to actually make it useful). Once they've used it, they will see it from a different perspective, because their beliefs will have changed.

I think it's different this time. Institutional investors are getting involved, which are probably more likely to take emotion out of it. Once their holdings go up a certain %, they're more likely to dump and consider the price way too hot. I don't think it'll go as high in % terms as it's done in the past.
I also think a large part of this rise is to do with China unbanning bitcoins again, and Huobi has had an insane amount of volume (40M bitcoins traded last week). The Chinese can be a bit me-too, and many wealthy are trying to get their money out of the country, which bitcoin is perfect for.

@_date: 2015-03-10 00:58:31
Which currency?
Fiat is plentiful, but scarcely dividable - the number have to go up for it to remain useful.
Bitcoins are scarce, but plentifully dividable - the number does not have to go up for it to remain useful.
Precious metals are scarce, and scarcely dividable.
The only reason fiat was necessary was because plentiful fiat meant bank loans are more likely to be paid off, with fewer bankruptcies meaning fewer or less painful recessions. Bitcoins require the government to preplan recession saving, rather than post-plan like they can with fiat.
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:28:09
Because bankers can't create bitcoins out of thin air.
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:48:50
When it's plentiful, it's saving, when it's scarce, it's hoarding.
Hoarding does hurt an economy. The difference with bitcoin, as the article points out, is that it's possible to make the monetary base permanently plentiful, unlike anything else that's preceded it.

Hoarding bitcoins is great for the world economy, because it means people are selling their fiat, and will have to sell more to own one.

It does that inherently. There are no restrictions on who can setup a bitcoin 'bank' account. It's 100% open to all assuming basic infrastructure (electricity/computing device). Banks can simply say no account for you (for whatever reason, legal issue or otherwise). Children can use it, too.
The payment system can only exist because of the former. There is no central banking authority that actually controls the money moving from one account to another, as it's all in the code/mining.

I think it can get to 4k regardless of the network TPS. Speculation, fiat hedging, and the halving all apply a consistent upward pressure to the price.
TPS helps with the long term value, whereby people start holding onto coins because they need them to transact.

wow...I still don't get how they were losing their money, though, if the robbers were inflating their account at the same time.

If an actor has a predisposition to holding bitcoins over fiat, then this makes more sense, but we're not there yet, and this is a long term game. 
For me, for the last year, I've always given a btc payment option on my software consulting with a fixed price (good for 2 weeks). I do this because my clients can be international, and dealing in BTC is much easier than fiat-fiat, with lower loss to fees. 
On another note, working in AUD and charging customers who have  EUR or USD, can be pretty volatile too. AUD has dropped around 35% against the USD in the last 2.5 years. Fiat has a longer term scale, but we all still seem to make it work. BTC would just require adjustment to prices more often, and will initially be more appropriate for shorter term products. 
With shorter term stuff, like the plumber, only the believers will attempt to do it first. Those who have a high enough margin will be able to do it and not worry too much about the volatility. 
In the case of something like a loaf of bread, if a baker decides to mark a fixed btc price for bread, they will sell more when the exchange rate is low, and less when it is high, but they can adjust their prices as necessary. They have to also be a bitcoin believer, though. Through their actions, however, they create a demand for bitcoins when the market rate is low, and less demand when the price is high - causing a smoothing effect on the price.

The problem is you're involving two different third parties for the transaction. Each will need to earn its fee somehow, and in this case, both bitpay and circle will do it via the spread (price per btc). If you don't want the customer to pay, then you have to pay.
One not so simple thing you can do: 
Do as you are doing now, except also calculate the difference owing, and send that to the bitpay address as your "fee". In the example you provided, that would be 0.000593 btc. 
If the customer doesn't send anything, presumably you'd still get your fee back, although I'm not sure about the nuances of bitpay. 
If the customer pays the $ amount you provided via circle, everything goes swimmingly.
If the customer notices and ends up sending the full amount in btc...do you basically get your fee back? Don't know how overpaying worth with bitpay either.
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:46:39
The other way to look at it is that the discount you're offering is helping people overcome the bitcoin mystery. This is as much a barrier to bitcoin transactions as the exchange slippage. 
Once someone has bought a few things, promotion ends, but the customer now also knows how easy it is to transact with bitcoin. Combine that with education on the other benefits, they are more likely to buy some bitcoins in bulk to have on hand when they want to actually buy something else.
@_date: 2015-02-28 09:14:08
Buying bitcoins is generally a pain in the ass in every way; deposit delays, exchange risks, shitty spreads (ie coinjar), thin order books, etc.

@_date: 2015-02-04 21:38:28
I see, so this is a consequence of them seeing it as a commodity, yes?
Technically, because this is a barter transaction, you should be collecting gst when you pay for something with bitcoins, because you are essentially "selling" it too (ie you need to charge 10% gst rule). This is only possible if you're registered for gst, though, and do the whole quarterly bas statement thing, which is a bit impractical for something as fluid as a bitcoin...huge barrier to everyday usage. 
Anyway, if the ATO is going to be like that for buying btc for cash, then they should be willing to give you credits for when you sell them, too, getting back the gst from your own purchase price when you sell them in tiny increments. This isn't actually a big deal for businesses that are already used to charging/claiming gst, but it will make it more difficult for the general populace.
One thing that comes to mind is say you bought a new car for $20k, and paid $2k gst on top of that. You then sell the car 3 years later for $10k, do you charge gst? If not, any time you use that cash to purchase anything, you end up with the double tax situation mentioned here - you paid $2k in tax to get that $10k cash 3 years later, and you have to pay gst on anything else you buy.

In the video, he describes the simplest smart contract as a bet - I bet harry potter will get a gpa of 4.0, and if I'm right I get xxx btc to this address.
Then he goes on about how there's no need for escrow, the funds are held de-centrally, so you don't have to trust a lawyer/escrow to release them, etc, as long as you meet the conditions set by the oracle. 
And therein lies the real issue. The escrow is a solvable problem, but the *oracle* isn't. There is always going to have to be a way to decide if something is true or not, and ALL disputes in all of human history have revolved around two people disagreeing on what is true, and what is not.
Smart contracts don't solve that problem...they just make sure the money is there for when whomever controls the oracle speaks.

A text file could also do exactly the same as a smart contract, if it happens to end with .py (or any other script)

While I don't agree with your language, I agree with your sentiment wholeheartedly. 
Bitcoins would never have been invented or reached the support they have if people had just "stuck with what they knew". Heck, we'd still be in caves. Alt-chains are incredibly important, because they allow the testing of new ideas. Some good ones can even be added back to bitcoins if they're worth it. 
This guy is just worried that his investment is worth less because the demand for cryptocurrency is not just focused on bitcoins. With so many alt-chains possible, it's very difficult to not feel like you're missing the boat somewhere.

Basically, own non-fiat assets if you want to protect your wealth.

So that's the only difference then. How does that make it 'smart'? Is bitcoin 'smart' money? or a decentralized ledger? "Smart" sounds a lot more like marketing hype than reality.

I've been using steamloader with steam...not instant but it's less likely to be shut down by valve. They basically sell those gift card codes for bitcoin.

What he's saying is that merchant fees are a cost of business. If a business doesn't consider these costs when pricing, and end up bankrupt, transactions with that business are no longer possible. 
Whether you call it what it is, or hide it in higher prices later, the consumer will always pay the cost of transactions.

When his 1M bitcoins mature or w/e the hell bs lie he was selling comes true...won't he be a kajillionaire anyway?

How is this even possible? Can't they just see which accounts the money went from -&gt; to and reverse it all?

You realize you could be providing an avenue for zhou tong to funnel his stolen funds through, right? The point is that you're potentially buying stolen coins. 
I'd be happy for that claim to be proven wrong, of course, with coinjar providing some transparency on where they source their coins - only necessary because of their association with zhou.

That seems like it would actually slow down the point of sale, wouldn't it? I suppose if it's done fast enough it won't be too big an issue. 
Super Speedy POS is really only important in super busy places anyway...most eftpos transactions would be just fine.

I had to think about this for a second. So you could basically just keep doing that and withdrawing from the positive accounts...I wonder how many people actually did that.

If what you say were true, bitcoins would never have been invented.
edit: Look at what he said from the perspective of fiat, when bitcoin was first invented.

When you run a full client on your home computer (eg bitcoin-qt), you are running a node, but the number of incoming connections is restricted to 8 or so unless you do proper port forwarding from your router. A full node opens up its firewall on the bitcoin port and is able to accept hundreds of connections, so people always have someone to talk to when they're performing transactions - they help make sure every transaction gets heard by the network.

I thought this was a bill to let the government accept bitcoins themselves for payment of taxes and fees. There is no problem with volatility at all with this - 10% tax on 1btc = 0.1 btc, at any point in the tax period.
Unless I'm misunderstanding it, this is huge.

It's not uncommon to test the old lows before a big ramp. Most of the ATHs were preceded by them.
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:51:21
But, if the bitcoins are paid to the government immediately on sale (super easy with bitcoins), the merchant's liability is settled, and the government can decide whether to hold or sell them immediately too.

They got a shady reputation because the owners always remained anonymous...I'm not sure if that's still the case. As we've seen with so many other exchanges (mtgox), knowing who the owner is doesn't remove the risk.
Technically they've always been good.
