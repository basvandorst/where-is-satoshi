Currently finishing the episode now.  There was a lot of things I would have explained better than Andreas did.  Am also a little disappointed in Redban.  Dating back to the first of the JRE podcasts, he was always the "techie."  I figured he wouldn't be so skeptical himself.  
It'd be nice if he Andreas would have just spent 10 minutes and showed Joe the software and the different wallets.  Much easier to understand once you've completed a transaction.

This was the best explanation I've seen to date. Been on BTC for about 4 years now, and have a good understanding of how everything works. However, when I started hearing the terms "fork" "segwit" and "BU" I had no fucking idea what what going on.
Thank you OP. I know understand the dilemma, and thus some of my anxiety is alleviated.

Can some also ELI5 how this is affecting the price?

Too hard to tell if it's the best investment yet. Long way to go.

Relatively yes.  As an assumed veteran, do you have any advice?

Well I bought when it was at $640.  Actually thought the trend would continue downward until it hit about $400-$500. Maybe this is just a spike due to the holidays.  Maybe it will continue to go down here in the next couple days.  I'm not entirely sure, but if it goes up to $1000 I'm selling.
