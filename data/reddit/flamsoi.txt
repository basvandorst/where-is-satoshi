It should still be very illegal to manipulate the price at exchanges, even though it's crypto currency.

A kilometer is a 1000 metres. So no, it's meters. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:52:39
Yeah that explains it...

Coinbase isn't really that far ahead of other exchanges today, at the all time high sure but not now. Just 300 dollars ahead of Bitstamp as of right now.

Well. They're only human. That's why blockchain technology is great, it removes the human factor in a lot of things. Obviously not at exchanges though.

Yeah I don't have any idea what he's doing tbh. He should have both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash now. Maybe he exchanged everything to Bitcoin Cash?

That too was the state of mind of people at the end of 2013. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe not. It's still the future.

Because it looks and feels just like the other times we got all time highs. It'll correct itself much lower in a month or two and then we'll see this again in a few years. Only the future will tell.

Sure. Market cap still has a long way to go but this price increase can't continue much more. If it does I'm as happy as any other guy with Bitcoin and I'll gladly be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:59:01
Doubtful. Sure it'd be nice but not realistic.

Probably before the user rush. I've been waiting four days for verification. Sooo slow. Now I just got verified at Coinbase after like ten minutes when I could finally send the verification in at all.

Yeah, it really is. Having a place to live is basic life security and if it costs as little as possible then you don't have to worry about it. Bitcoin can go to 5 million, I don't really care as long as I can get a good apartment on the way. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:50:35
That's what everyone said 2013 too. But yeah, I get it.

This. That's exactly what happened. A crash has been imminent since it went up 45% in one day.
