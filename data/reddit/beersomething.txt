[Inflation is a sustained increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.](

What disrespectful nonsense!
@_date: 2018-08-10 03:01:35
Who let all in all the dipshit goldbugs?

Price goes up: You can't explain that.
Price goes down: You can't explain that.

Are you saying that the bitcoin market will always be manipulated?
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:13:26
That’s why we have Segwit and LN. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:31:31
That will be super convenient when we’ll get to count leading zeros for every transaction. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:12:02
No, all those countries have problems because they don’t use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 13:00:24
Nobody’s jealous of you. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 00:12:16
Or replace but never spend. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:32:42
That will be great when bitcoin eventually catches up to existing privacy coins. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:09:00


You are the 1%.
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:34:56
He needs to stop attacking bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:29:30
Inflation can be caused by printing money, but inflation itself is defined as rising prices of goods. There are other reasons that inflation can occur besides printing money.  See the difference? 
@_date: 2018-08-09 23:11:56
Bitcoin can only go up because of math. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:53:51
You put money in it and it never comes back out because you hodl. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:32:09
The problem with spending bitcoin is that you forever look at your purchases and calculate how much you paid in terms of today’s valuation. Why torture yourself?
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:21:02
Bitcoin was a currency 6 years ago. Now it's something else.
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:05:42
Without SegWit bitcoin is basically pointless.
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:23:08
Your explanation is bad. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:04:57
How long until you pay off your equipment costs?
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:15:11
That's far too low. We need more Segwit, not less.
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:12:29
1 BTC = 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-08-09 23:21:58
That’s why you should never spend bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:18:39
It’s like say there was a lock and you needed to find a key to open it. But you couldn’t just make a key that you know would fit. The only way would be to try as many different keys as possible, and everyone else is doing the same. There is some amount of luck in finding the right key, but if you’re making more guesses per second than the other competitors then you have a higher chance of guessing correctly. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:52:25
Yeah dude. It’s a big conspiracy. You’re just too smart for it though. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:43:29
Do you even Segwit?
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:59:55
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:32:16
Satoshi must be spinning in her grave. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:52:26
So are we calling Lightning 1.0 a bust then?
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:33:26
They don’t show the respect for SegWit that it deserves. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:19:40
Shhhhhhhhh! Don't tell!!
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:25:18
Well, depending also on if the hashrate keeps climbing. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:37:18
I think you should give Andreas more respect for all he has done for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:19:16
Exactly. That’s why instead of spend and replace you should hodl and buy more. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 03:11:56
No but I see the bottle of penis pills on the desk. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:51:22
I'm sure the respect he earned from you is what keeps him warm at night.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:11:52
I'm sure it was all worth it in order to bring freedom to the masses. /s
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:56:51
That's not how it works when other charges are dropped. They don't go back and retry all of the stuff that's already been settled. There isn't such a thing as judicial regression testing.
