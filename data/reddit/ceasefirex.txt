Seriously, owe Andreas an immense debt of gratitude.  Anytime I got concerned or tempted to sell, I'd watch a few of his videos and would recalibrate myself on the long term vision.  AA is a master with words.. not many people can do what he does so effortlessly.  I always start my newbie Bitcoin conversations with "I'm no Andreas but...."

@_date: 2015-06-04 02:25:30
Of course.. If the market decided lite coin is the better chain of value, then that would be that and that's what I would use.  Currently Bitcoin is the de facto value chain with no signs of that waning.  The support and commitment should be to the community, the devs, and those less economically fortunate who can benefit greatly but may not know it yet... That happens to be led by Bitcoin... But conceivably that could change.. Though improbable at this point.
@_date: 2015-06-05 11:17:38
True but .. the trouble is a new crypto is born every minute it seems .. i'm certainly not worried because it's clear the decentralized solution will always have a huge following .. 
Knowing what's she's done in the past, could it be conceivable that she is looking for ways to make a huge impact but recognizing it will likely take place on bitcoin's blockchain?  If she did, what incentive would she have to divulge that info now rather than later ...

I think I see - so bitcoin transfers the value (in this case the proof that I am the owner of the vehicle) via a small sum...and any data that would be accompanied with the transaction (i.e. geo-positional data, etc) could be perhaps linked to the bitcoin transaction but otherwise housed in an alternate chain?  Maybe hashed and included in the bitcoin transaction but the actual data resides elsewhere?

I just don't get the sell your stash thought process... sell for what, inflating dollars that are literally depreciating?  Why would I want more of those?  If the answer is to buy things, then why not just buy them with BTC?  I'd just rather have Bitcoin at the end of the day.

"Without mining consensus to protect a network from attacks and double spending, all nodes on a Hyperledger network require permission to join the network in the first place, from some kind of central administrator. By many estimates if more than a third of the nodes decide to steal from the rest, they can easily pull off a successful attack. It's essential that the administrator of each Hyperledger chooses trustworthy people to join."

Some folks here have more lint in their pockets than common courtesy.  It's never easy to know when's the best time to invest in bitcoin because simply put, no one knows what the next 3 hours will hold let alone tomorrow.  
That said, find your personal risk appetite, and use coinbase (if you're in the US) to pick a little up.  Now is as good a time as any considering it was more than double the price only months ago.
Good luck and feel free to ask any other questions you may have.

Another point that could be made is that there would most likely be private policing services.  These services, rather than maintaining regional monopolies of force as they do today, would have to compete openly, fairly, and transparently to gain the public's trust and business.  They would also work to resolve disputes with as LITTLE violence as possible as this would be a huge plus seeing as most folks don't like being around when bullets are flying.  So that rogue defiant playing Gandalf in the middle of the street would be decommissioned rather quickly .. most likely by the regional private police force being contracted by the nearest community who have a vested interest in keeping their community safe.
The point of Anarchy is not to be devoid of rules .. it's simply to remove coercion from the equation.

That's a huge topic on itself.  It's obvious that patenting certainly favors the big corps who buddy up with gov't... they're practically guaranteed to push the little guy out of the field.   Why?  They have the cash and power through influence to do so.  Why?  Because there is someone there to influence (gov't).  Big corps stifle innovation and fatten the pockets of lawyers by dragging trivial patents through the system... and when that happens, it's a net loss for everyone. The law tends to favor the already powerful..and patent law is no exception of this.

Market's don't just go straight up despite your favorite prayers...every time there's some selling we get to read about how it's manipulated.  Fuck sake .. it's people selling.  You can't prove it over normal market fluctuations which go up and *gasp* come down ... 
"Obvious manipulation" is obvious because you can prove it.  You guys can't prove shit in this case.  The price dropping to $4 and then back up to $500 would lend more credence to such a statement.  The price dropping $30 is market manipulation?  Give me a damn KitKat bar...

Sorry OP for your bad experience here on I don't get why people here seem to need to outsmart eachother and act like dicks by default... 
... to your post.. it's always tough to call bottoms.  If anyone here was good at it, they probably wouldn't be on these boards... As the adage goes, buying when others are fearful tends to payoff more often than not .. but you shouldn't invest more than you're comfortable losing or being eroded further .. a continued decline is always a possibility.  If not, then yes, now would be a great time to get in.

While only tangentially related in that they both share the need for that "killer app", the last paragraph brought a stream of ideas to mind.  
It states:
“I believe sharing virtual spaces will ultimately be the most powerful and widely used aspect of VR,” Mr Abrash said. “Imagine anyone on the face of the earth being able to be anywhere, with anyone, doing anything, whenever they want.”
I could definitely envision a future where I'm wearing a OR headset in NYC and participating in a live immerse feed of a live walk-through of a famous museum in France where an admission is required to enter which can easily be paid in Bitcoin.  The possibilities are mind blowing and so very interesting.

@_date: 2014-02-20 12:17:59
Sounds to me like much lower prices on Bitstamp and the other exchanges then...
Once the flood gates are open, the arb potential will drive traffic to the other exchanges for selling at 3x profit driving the price down until there's equilibrium with the new gox price and the remaining exchanges... of course, it's not like there are only 2 exchanges out there so it's not going to half the price but I would think the prices on all other exchanges will have to dip in the face of all the selling of withdrawn gox btc...

I think the important take-away .. if you can take-away anything here... is that Bitcoin is in its infancy.  It's a baby and has A LOT of growing up to do.  It's still waaaaay too complicated for the soccer mom let alone grandma.  
If you've done any research on what Bitcoin can do, the utility should be pretty obvious .. but again, making that utility accessible to EVERYONE will take time and many innovative financial solutions that we haven't even considered will be built upon a continuing iteration of this technology.... whether that ends up being our beloved Bitcoin, or a Bitcoin 2.0 ... the amount of pent up energy in this industry is only beginning to be released ... as they say, "the cracks are where the light shines through" .. imo, the cracks are about to bust open.  
Whether you're interested in owning any or not, keep checking back in this field as I think you'll continue to see interesting things.

This "concept" of something only having value if you can physically hold it in your hand is truly annoying.
Wind can't be held .. yet windmills hold great value to those who make use of them and benefit from them.
Emails can't be held .. yet they have intrinsic value as a means of transmitting information instantly around the globe.  
Don't get me started on religion.  Can't see, touch, feel, smell, hear, or quantifiably measure God in ANY way with ANY infrared, spectrascope, etc .. yet BILLIONS believe in Him with eternal trust.   
Enough with the "it has no intrinsic value" argument.  It's so tired and absurd that it literally casts a shadow of irrelevance on everything else stated.

See... this is where I think you're wrong and we'll have to agree to disagree.  It all boils down to definitions.  If we don't define the terms we use, then there's no point in debating.  9 out of 10 people think they're describing Capitalism but in fact are describing Corporatism or Cronyism.... even fascistic corporatism.  Capitalism was blamed for the recent '08 recession when in fact it was corporatism incarnate.  Capitalism is trading value for mutually beneficial gain and it certains entails inequality .. of talent, of wealth, of income, of initiative, etc.. but without the use of force. I understand your point on controlling suppliers as an example of "force" but the fact is, the internet neutralizes much of those efforts ... especially when it's so much easier and profitable to buy off a bureaucrat.  Now.. what we have today, is a system where government unjustly rules business and creates conditions of moral hazard left and right .. through subsidies, bailouts, enabling monopolies.. sometimes in broad day light... and sometimes in back rooms.  With every pundit on the radio and television calling the current system Capitalism, you can see how the general populace grows to despise the term and organizes bullshit OC rallies.  
anyway .. fun chat.  thanks for keeping it civil.

sure they're worth that on the exchange that currently prohibits withdrawals... 
I don't think it can be any clearer than that.  On exchanges where you can actually retrieve your funds (in BTC or fiat), the rate is "almost" double..
my point being that folks may be selling out of fear of what's going on at gox.. but once they see those being apples and oranges, things may correct quickly.

Eventually it can serve as a currency, but it can't today.  
Many of your concerns will be fleshed out in the coming years.  If you're not comfortable with purchasing/using Bitcoins yet, no one is forcing you.  Jump in when you feel comfortable.  Meanwhile, I'd recommend learning more about the protocol itself rather than this first "currency" application ... therein lies the true inherent value you've yet to recognize.

You really are confused.  Which I don't blame you for because the education system blows.  So you're afraid of monopolies developing... and your solution is to have government's in charge as watch dogs ... You do realize government's are exclusive monopolies of the use of force .. i.e monopolies of violence.  That is to say, the worst of all monopolies.  
How exactly would Intel be able to fund purchasing every CPU producer in the world exactly?  There are so many irrationalities in this that's its hard to know where to start.
Bottom line, I don't think you have a single problem with monopolies in general if you support the concept of government... so rest easy.

Agreed.

Be that welfare in the poorest cities to the richest who benefit from the subsidies.  The blockchain isn't going to disappear... even if the Bitcoin Blockchain were to be compromised in some manner, people would find ways to make it stronger and it would come back .. better, faster, stronger.. it's here now.

Apologize in advance for the rant but I feel the notion that a 100 bit tip is a wasted effort or even insulting is unwarranted. Comparing it to a tip received by someone waiting tables is unjustified and an apples vs oranges comparison at best. 
The way I see, right or wrong, is that social media via reddit, youtube, tumbler, etc is simply a medium for exchanging experiences, ideas, insights, and inspirations with the world. Some will find the information valuable while others will not. Currently, when someone graces the internet with some notably clever, insightful, or otherwise helpful wisdom, they usually get crowned with thousands of upvotes .. which incidentally are worth exactly zero..other than some warm and fuzzies. The few exceptional of those will be gilded with gold (taking reddit as the current example) ... but many times there are plenty of other helpful posts that, though deserving of a little something extra than a up-arrow nod, receive nothing more.
Here we have a payment medium that is perfect for microtransactions and I see a bunch of folks saying it's not a good idea. I say BS. The point isn't to tip someone so that they can push it to a paper wallet and pray to retire when bitcoin hits $100k a piece ... the point is to say 'hey thanks for the words... here's a small token of thanks' ... everyone can and should define "small" as they see fit.
Everyone has their own rating strategies and evaluations for determining the worth of a piece of shared information and their tips will be directly proportional to the value as it applies to them.
So I say, let's not setup these arbitrary limits to what is and is not acceptable as a tip. If you find value in a comment and want to say, hey thanks here's 3 cents for your tip jar, then so be it. And if you feel the series of words they've strung together warrants a $10 tip and you can afford it, so be it! Because that's precisely how I see this in this context .. a tip jar that you're filling for others as they fill for you. The more people see the tips, the more people say "what is this anyway?" ... 
Last thing we should be doing is discouraging folks, especially interested newcomers, on what's the newly accepted norm.

Granted.  Definitely more volatile.  
From a look-to-the-future standpoint though, Bitcoin seems more interesting (to me) than dollars what with all the de-dollarization going on around the world.  Eventually the penny will drop (basked in the glory of that pun) and the dollar will be relegated to the dust bin of failed fiat currencies... but trick is, no one knows when.

Agreed that he should have probably worded that differently... if I could offer an alternative viewpoint..
I think it's very, VERY difficult for people to concede, even for a moment, that life without a government could work .. if for no other reason than that it would invalidate a whole HELL of a lot of what they've been taught and come to understand the world as their whole lives.  Asking people to chew that off is asking them to consider a viewpoint that would completely ostracize them from everyone they probably know, care about, or interact with... it's asking them to leave their comfortable view of the world and to stand alone looking through a new lens entirely .. whether you agree with advocates of anarchy or not, even those of us who simply look to advance the conversation in a peaceful way, hopefully you can respect the positions that are taken which are almost always scoffed upon, ridiculed, and browbeaten.  In the end, we all want what is best for ourselves and our loved ones.

@_date: 2014-03-15 01:44:55
Wrong.  Fiat IS printed out of thin air.  Bitcoin is NOT.  You are making an incorrect assumption that he means for "thin air" to signify "intangible".. This is a semantic misunderstanding.
"Thin air" in his context is to imply that they can literally print any NUMBER of new currency notes into existence from NOTHING... no reason or rationale, simply because they deem it necessary.  Thus devaluing the purchasing power of your and my hard-earned money.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, can NOT be literally printed into existence at the tune of whatever denomination deemed necessary by a group of folks in suits.  Its set and tapering rate are fixed and that's that.  Intangible though it may be, it can't be printed into literal oblivion.  
Long winded, but I think it's important to note that distinction in terms.

I'm sorry and how did they achieve those huge gains?  Did they .. perhaps, utilize an established group of individuals with a monopoly of force (read gov't) to create an environment where competition is stifled and barriers to entry are lifted to insurmountable levels without the deepest pockets?  .. if that's where they received their huge gains, then yes I agree with you... but you can see how the free market should hardly bear the burden of the responsibility.

you make some excellent and insightful points in this post and I do hope you get the upvotes you deserve.  This coming from a self-proclaimed bitcoin fanboy.  Trolling is one thing, but there are then those times we can speak up about true potential hurdles that wrongly get bundled with those troll downvotes.  
All that said, i would think they have much more incentive to take over bitcoin rather than some other altcoin simply because they can leverage the network effect themselves... so assuming they did hardfork and convince other industries to follow them, would they at least still be limited to the bitcoin protocol's coin limit?  This question probably comes from my fundamental lack of knowledge on how bitcoin protocol changes are ACTUALLY modified when deemed necessary... 
If they couldn't do anything about the hard 21 million coins, perhaps at the very minimum it might constrain their deficit spending habits ..

I get your point and agree that college is really more of a socially pressed upon need more so than a genuine prerequisite for success .. however, it still stands to reason that, as useless as those years may or may not be for someone, a college degree (especially in engineering, math, science, or medicine) is a crucial key to landing that first job.  Once you have that first job, it's cupcakes and candycorn landing the second.  Decade old social norms, while glaringly inefficient and unnecessary, are hard to shake.

One major problem with the Bitcoin space, and now with ever increasing evidence and examples to point to, is that folks want to wait it out and see if it works.  Flops like this doesn't help in the credibility dept .. People who don't follow bitcoin won't know about this and folks who do follow but haven't jumped in yet will point to this as another reason why they shouldn't.  It's unfortunate but it's part of the volatility that exists in the community outside of what we already deal with in the price.

A Modified Centered Climbing Algorithm for Linear Programming
In this paper, we propose a modified centered climbing algorithm (MCCA) for linear programs, which improves the centered climbing algorithm (CCA) developed for linear programs recently. MCCA implements a specific climbing scheme where a violated constraint is probed by means of the centered vector used by CCA. Computational comparison is made with CCA and the simplex method. Numerical tests show that, on average CPU time, MCCA runs faster than both CCA and the simplex method in terms of tested problems. In addition, a simple initialization technique is introduced.

Sure .. anything is theoretically possible .. and in the end, if the end goal is to give society as a global unit more independent control of their money and financial assets, then I suppose it doesn't matter which digital currency wins the race ... but btc simply has one hell of a headstart.  
I take it you've employed the fixed dollar figure approach to your btc position rather than a percentage of assets approach.  Nothing wrong with that.  Everyone's risk appetite is different and respected.

You're deviating from my original point quite a bit with that statement.  I never said anything about bitcoin growing to that point.  My point was that it's not capable of being printed into oblivion .. and that your military fixation is only relevant if the underlying currency remains sound.

what's your ratio of CC paying customers to cash paying customers?  This day and age, my guess is 10:1.  
Seems like incentive enough to work through this issue.  For now, in 2014, it seems like accepting Bitcoin as a payment method rather than a currency is the way to go ... being the trend-setter in this arena as a Big Box company will payoff handsomely imo... best of luck through this process and THANK you for considering it.  Kudos.

I disagree.  Threaten suppliers how?  If there's no barrier to entry, they can't keep their prices down low forever.. and if there's no limit to who can compete, then price discovery for those goods or services will find a proper price point at a lower level.  If there's isn't a significant value proposition for the competitor, then yes, the original company with the monopoly will retain control of the market.  Nothing wrong with this until they start jacking up the price .. but that won't last long as prices will soon drop again to your own admission... again assuming there is NO ONE distorting the competitive environment with red tape and barriers to entry.

I know candlestick analysis is entrails and voodoo dolls to most and certainly never a guarantee of anything .. but the current bullish engulfing candle forming on the weekly right now is looking like a nice setup for future gains.  Not saying they WILL happen, but when scenarios like this start to form, from a risk perspective you tend to treat it as a potential reversal and position yourself accordingly.

Now, if you said I'm going to start an internet company, people would look at you funny and you'd be dating yourself to the 90's...because if you're starting any company and not using the internet, you're doing something very wrong... yet today we say I'm going to start a Bitcoin company ... and it's very probable that in the near future, you will start a financial technology company that of COURSE is built upon Bitcoin/Blockchain technology.. and saying otherwise would result in those same weird looks..."

Bitcoin isn't a fart on an ants ass in comparison.  You are inviting an onslaught of negative public reaction to any future cause of yours.

It's easy to be discouraged by the price action.  When I find myself bummed about it, I simply recall to those even earlier days where it went to $30 and then down to $2!  It had no where near the global recognition at the time, no where near the network robustness, and for all intents and purposes, if it was going to die, it would have done so right then.  And from $2 it now stands in the upper $400s.

You on the other hand have espoused it's inevitable demise at every opportunity.  Do you have insider info?  If so, let's have some proof.  Otherwise, this COULD be a correction after a large run up just as there is historical precedence.  We're saying the same thing.  Be cautious and tread lightly ... we differ in that I'm saying this could be an exciting journey with the possibility for complete loss .. and you're saying he's going to lose it all period.  What a somber outlook on a potentially exciting new technology.

i think you're confused.
A monopoly can absolutely present itself and thrive in a free market.  And there is NOTHING wrong with that.  If you have a fantastic product and no one else wants to enter your field, you aren't charging enough.  Eventually you'll raise your price to a point where someone else will say "hey wait a minute, i can get how much for this?  i can design one better for less" .. and presto, your monopoly will so receive it's first competitor... and duke it out you shall in the free market of goods and services.  Essentially ..as soon as someone comes along offering a product close to yours with a better value proposition, then the monopoly is retained no more.  UNLESS, and that's a BIG fucking UNLESS, a GOVERNMENT is around that said original monopoly owners can get in bed with, have legislation be drawn up for, you scratch my back and i'll endorse and fund your re-election, etc, etc, etc ... THEN, suddenly conditions begin to emerge where the original monopoly maintains it's stronghold and the mom &amp; pops disappear.  The longer these conditions exist, the larger the monopolies exist and buy out competition which feeds their growth, affording more re-elections, getting more legislation drafted, hell even switching between high levels positions within the company and gov't .. see Monsanto as one case of many.  HELLO, that's NOT a free fucking market.  That's using the State i.e. a monopoly of violence, to destroy competition.

here's a gem of a comment from the marketwatch article regarding the MSFT news:
"Jared Dintrone 6 hours ago
 Slade Actually Buttcoins is not a threat to the Federal Reserve.  It is a model that the federal reserve is going to use for it's digital version of the US dollar ponzi scam.  Buttcoins is more of a threat to gold and was the reason gold tanked in 2011.  Money that should have gone to gold went to Buttcoins instead and on top of that the ones who sold gold to chase the gains in Buttcoins lost money when Buttcoins went from $1300 down to $300 today and those that are trying to get back their gold can only buy back about one fourth of their lost gold.  If it weren't for Buttcoins, Cypriots would have bought gold and silver instead.  Now that Buttcoins is almost being phased out for it's flaws thanks to the people who hacked MtGox and showed that Buttcoins can in fact be duplicated through MtGox, and the Swiss Franc is being anchored down by the Euros thanks to the "no" vote for the gold referendum, gold is once again the only safe haven that people will go to in turbulent markets."

I'll admit I haven't read every post in this thread .. so accept my apologies for any redundancy in advice here..
I would first welcome and congratulate you on your willingness to learn more and get it right the first time.  It's intimidating at first but you soon realize .. this isn't that bad.  It's not ready for mainstream yet so you're still early in that regard .. but before you go investing lots .. please limit yourself to $50 or so.  
Take that $50 and play with it.  Send it over and over and over again.  Hell if it means you have to burn it all up in miner's fees, so be it.  Send it to Electrum.  Send it out .. send it to paper.  Pull it out of paper.  Send it to coinbase, blockchain.info, and various other credible online wallet providers.  And then back to your desktop wallet.  This way, if you make a mistake, and you most likely will, the cost of your mistake is capped.  
The worst thing you could do right now is get excited about how rich you're about to be, buy a shit ton of BTC, and then store it away and not have a freakin' clue on how to use it.  
Oh, and buy something with it!  After all .. that's kind of the point.

Thanks for the quick response Aaron.  I agree I would not want to clutter up the sending process at all.  I really like how quick and easy it is.  I was thinking more of a third option .. perhaps a third swipe over to a separate screen that allows you to check a public addresses balance.  It wouldn't tie into paying or sending funds, simply a "for reference only" option.  I have found several times where i wanted to scan a quick QR code to check the balance and have no way of doing so other than having to type the whole address by hand into a block explorer ... figured I'd throw the suggestion out there.  It's your baby afterall.  Again, my thanks for a great iOS app.

tell him not to buy a single bitcoin until he's:
1. learned about the difference between cold wallets and hot wallets
2. purchased some bitcoin and moved it to a mobile wallet
3. moved that bitcoin to an encrypted cold wallet
4. swept that bitcoin back to a mobile wallet
5. buys something with the bitcoin
I think if he familiarizes himself with these, he'll feel more confident that he knows how to navigate around the handling of bitcoin and should ultimately allow him to be more comfortable with the investment (apart from price discovery gyrations that is).

I don't think so at all ... I think that may be juxtaposing your sentiments with those of the mainstream.  I think the mainstream hasn't even really started paying attention to Bitcoin.  Most still have no idea what it is AT ALL... so what if there was a bitcoin bowl .. few million folks watched it .. maybe a hand full of hundred thousand paid close enough attention to even slightly care about the sponsor .. I'd bet the majority didn't... it's great exposure but it's a drop in the bucket.  All the news articles that we see on might make it feel like society is dripping in oversaturation of bitcoin exposure and STILL couldn't care about it but that's just BS... 90% of folks out there still have no idea what it is, what its about, why to use it, or what benefits it has .. and in fairness, a great deal of the innovation on the platform that will capture the attention of those audiences may not even be invented/discovered/innovated yet.  
So no... it's too early to be hanging the hat of defeat over this coatrack just yet.  In 5 to 8 years, if we're at the same level of mainstream ignorance, then perhaps we can relegate it to the dustbin of interesting hobbies .. til then, it's an infant with lots of growing pains and successes ahead.

"Bitcoin: While 2014 was a rough year for bitcoin (it was ranked the “worst performing currency”), I am optimistic that 2015 will be a better year for the cryptocurrency. Weak currencies and uncertainty in the global economy, emerging smartphone markets in developing countries (billions coming online for the first time), better “interfaces,” and more commercial adopters who accept bitcoin as a form of payment will all play a role in a brighter bitcoin future. Finally, it’s worth noting that Apple Pay will ultimately teach an entire generation how to navigate life without cash…making the transition to bitcoin natural and easy."

Because the infrastructure doesn't need to be laid out like it did in the days of the early internet.  Today we already have all that and the disruptive nature of a new platform like bitcoin (in theory) shouldn't take a full 20 years to begin actually entering the day-to-day lives of your average citizen.   It will however take some time to develop the many killer apps that will utilize this technology .. The whole "if it hasn't happened yet, it's never going to happen" mentality is a fallacious one .. and to say the party is over is a bit short-sighted... in my opinion that is, which is worth a half chewed bagel on a good day I'll admit.  But your statement could have been (and probably was) said when bitcoin went from $30 to $2... and from $260 to $50...  If you're down money and feel burned, I get it...maybe its time for you to step away.  Few things are often this transparent to the public.. normally this volatility in new ventures happens behind the scenes... with bitcoin its out in the open for all to see and all too often criticize.

well... mining is hardly pointless .. but it's certainly more expensive for your average joe to participate in now than it was in years past.  I know what you meant but sometimes I cringe when I see people say mining is pointless as a newcomer may not immediately understand that you're implying it's no longer cost-feasible for most... and instead figure that mining is not necessary.

Well done.
I did something similar this holiday season ... have a buddy who's been a skeptic since I got involved in 2013 .. I told him to go to Hot Maple's site and that I'd buy him a bottle of hot sauce.  So he went to the site, clicked BitPay, put in his name and address for shipping, and then I walked over, pulled my phone out, and *blip - send* .. checkmark on the screen.  
Seeing is believing for some.  He's holding out for $100's ... as much promise this technology hodls, he may get his chance yet ..

Yes, perfect for a joint account for large purchases (or even everyday bills) where both parties have decided the money can only be spent if they both agree to the purchase.  This would actually help a whole ton of people who have budgeting problems .. they could set aside some free-to-spend monthly allowance money for each of them in their own single signature wallet to use as they please, and the rest of their funds for paying mortgage, bills, etc could be placed in a 2-sig wallet so both are aware of and authorize the spending of their money.  would greatly reduce the impulse buys once one's allowance money is up for the month.  
obviously there are a myriad of other applications but that scenario quickly came to mind.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:06:27
Mr. Govt doesn't care about ruining its BTC self interests.  See, it already can create money out of thin air into infinity.  You can bet they're paying attention to this.

This seems like a good a time as any to request an ELI5 on how these types of releases work.  Whose releasing this update?  Is it simply an update to the client or is the Bitcoin protocol being affected?  If the protocol is affected, is it a majority of the developers that need to agree on the changes?  Still not clear on how the "bitcoin updates" process works ...  would be glad to be directed toward useful links but figured there are others that are new or never dove in deep that might be interested as well...

It's a contentious time with volatility, uncertainty, and fear driving markets to be irrational .... so pretty much just another day in this space.  
So .. not to be crude, but if you have to ask this question, you probably should NOT be buying.  You need to do a lot more research into what you're getting into ... you should know what you're buying and WHY you're buying.  Otherwise, you're likely just setting yourself up to be whiplash candidate on this rollercoaster.

why the innate urge to be such a dick?  oh, it's i forgot we have so many self-righteous posters with a heightened sense of moral authority. 
i make a statement (albeit poorly) making a probable case that the price could fall further and to take solace that it would provide more opportunity to accumulate at a lower price, and you take that opportunity to exemplify how to be a snarky jack ass.

If your friends couldn't see the value in buying BTC years ago in the midst of all the hacks and scaling crap, they sure as heck don't have the insight to know when to sell.  You're doing right by holding on tight.. in the end you'll not sell, but spend as it'll be accepted.  And you'll preserve all that purchasing power... it's boggles me why people think we'd want to jump ship from the appreciating asset to the depreciating asset...

Honestly .. that's quite an insulting post as you're assuming I'm not capable of knowing that I didn't check a box.  Undercooked chicken compared to having your checking account raided weeks apart when doing NOTHING in the account?   Are you 5?  This happened to me twice and I didn't say anything.  I resolved it.  No fuss.  But a third time?  I don't consider myself as a complainer... i don't send food back at restaurants.... but three times is in 'enough is enough' territory.  It's not an isolated incident .. it's a trend.  And who's asking to campaign anything... i'm just communicating an repeat offender experience that was the last straw.  I too hope they resolve matters.  This is a massive bitcoin turnoff to anyone having to deal with these types of issues .. but let's just sweep that under the rug.  Nothing to see here... all is well, he must just be an idiot, right?  Til it happens to you.  That's all the post was about.

So wait... the wallets would have to be capable of supporting every type of coin?  And how does the fee work again?  If I pay with PIVX let's say, but it converts it to BTC, I only pay a LN fee right?  And the vendor then pays the BTC blockchain miner fee when he decides to settle up, is that right?  I need to read the LN site.

@_date: 2016-06-23 02:42:28
Agreed.  Stop watching the price (you won't) or you'll get addicted (you already are) ... but what inevitably what will happen if you keep watching your balance chisel away is you'll sway this way and that and finally just before a large bounce up, you'll sell away the pain.  Then you'll check the price again a few hours/days later only to see yourself missing out, mad at yourself for not just holding out, will likely buy back in before another mild reversal to the downside where you'll curse all things and likely post threads about market manipulation.  Don't be that guy.  Just "HODL" .. grab some popcorn... maybe pick up a little more when you really start people freaking out on the forums...  
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:15:40
I tried talking to people about it in 2013 ... and more in 2014 ... then I realized that most people here in America don't realize an immediate benefit from this technology, as groundbreaking as it is, ... it doesn't significantly impact their day to day conveniences and routines ... so no matter how passionate I was about it, they politely nodded and shrugged with a smile ... 
For other countries, Bitcoin represents a new digital salvation in a sense ... but it's just not the case for the common man here in the States ... 
That said, if anyone shows a genuine interest and approaches me to help explain it, i have a hard time not unleashing several years of pent up teachings.

Andreas has said it all along.  At this point, the only thing that could hurt Bitcoin is if it collapses from within.  Personally, I don't think we're anywhere close to that scenario.  Sure there is the obvious dispute, but I believe that bitcoin will adapt and survive.  If it doesn't, it will certainly be a tragedy and an incalculable loss considering the economic opportunity cost of billions of people yearning for this level playing field.  I believe there's too much at stake at this point for it go that far.  That said, it's still a tiny boat in a ferocious ocean.  Many a bumpy ride ahead.

I'm usually wrong.  No argument there my friend.
But to your point, there are already thousands of competing cryptocurrencies.  They exist today and more will tomorrow.  Many of them are faster, cheaper, etc ... but they don't hold a candle to bitcoin.  Bitcoin has the most network effects .. it's backed by its scarcity, it's backed by its trust and immutability, it's backed by the notion that literally some of the smartest people on this planet, that had a hand in shaping the internet you and I use today, are working on ever improving the software and making it even more robust, it's backed by the legitimacy of major institutional momentum taking hold which cascades into further trust.  It's a trust engine ... backed by cryptography and the laws of mathematics.  
Saying "sorry but it really is backed by nothing" shows either 1) an unwillingness to accept that value can be assigned to something (i.e. money) in more creative ways than by the decree of power people in high places with military force... or 2) a contrarian need to make sense of current events by pulling from past experiences and avoiding the truth that is staring the world in the face.
Saying it's not backed by anything is certainly your opinion, but can be refuted with only a trivial amount of research and intellectual honesty.  
Don't mean for anything of my words to come across as insulting to you personally ... I've had this same tired conversation with a great many folks who preach the same 'backed by nothing' mantra.  If we were talking about donut sprinkles, you'd have me nodding in agreement.  But we're not.

Anyone else get the impression that this BitX guy is missing the point a bit (nevermind the interviewer)?  You can’t exactly make the statement “Maybe it’ll be a currency .. 1% chance or so..” ..i.e. the currency isn’t really the exciting thing here…. and then expound on the fact that bitcoin could be the underlying layers used by all.  This is the “blockchain = awesome, bitcoin = meh” fallacy that is still apparently not fully appreciated or understood by intelligent people.  It’s not rocket science .. if bitcoin’s price goes to shit, so does the blockchain.  Low price = low incentive to mine = reduced security = no one uses this as the assumed de-facto transaction layer.  Couple that with the reducing block reward and the scenario is obviously self-evident.  Sure, companies can create their own blockchains .. but if it isn’t decentralized, what’s the point?  Nevermind the grassroot network effects that have to be re-born…   For the life  of me, I just shake my head at some of these folks… I mean, am I missing something?  Please tell me if I am – I will happily stand corrected if I’m wrong.

If Bitcoin was backed by nothing, it wouldn't be worth $9k+.  The reason why it's valued so high is the supply is dry... as folks recognize the potential of "digital scarcity", they realize how profound its implications and the hold (or hodl) on tight.  There is an incredible amount of developers, merchants, exchanges, miners, users .. all working to improve the software and scale this leviathan so that it eventually fulfills all the expectations that you're listing.  This is a nascent technology and industry and you're scolding it's inability to be everything for everyone after only 9 years of existence... I agree that there's rampant speculation but there's also just as much conviction as the buyer's start peeling back the onion on what they just bought ... a few layers in and they realize they'll squirrel away the majority of their holdings and play trade the rest ... until they get burned and then just turn to stone cold holders... drying up more supply.  
It's really the beginning and the user experience we'll see in 5 years will look nothing like we have today.  I'm sure the basic fundamental understanding will lag the price .. but eventually it too will come.  Cheers

Thanks for your response.  If for no other reason than to demonstrate that compromise and forward progress is achievable in a decentralized global project and thus help boost the exhausted morale of this community, I would think a third option should at least be considered.  Didn't Jeff G. have something that fit this bill?  Though I agree, it may seem now is the time to iron these things out ..

@_date: 2015-07-24 11:40:29
Perhaps it's also important to realize that Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum either ... if there is real institutional demand for Bitcoin's secure blockchain (especially paired with the Lightning Network), then this is obviously not a bad thing.  However, there are other competing blockchains... if cryptocurrencies receive the level of full banking usage legitimacy, then merchants will undoubtedly be open to receiving other cryptos (perhaps limited to only the most popular basket) for their cup of coffee sales.

Yes.  If it is to remain permissionless without having to recreate a network effect from the ground up, then bitcoin (little b) is really the massive 400PH/s behemoth that everyone is trying their best to pretend they can ignore.  
Anyone can create permissioned blockchains but they'll have to develop, maintain, and secure it themselves.  It's not like "the" Bitcoin Blockchain is going away so these facts can't be avoided forever.
Excited for this stream though - I think there are plenty of folks at MS that understand the blockchain is only as strong as the value of its incentive mechanism.

In all seriousness, as more and more innovation (such as the recent Confidential Transactions features of upcoming SideChains) occurs allowing more transactional privacy, at what point does the cost of maintaining, securing, trusting, etc., these permissioned blockchains become an unnecessary burden when compared with "the" defacto permissionless blockchain?  /rhetorical 
I can see why bankers are excited about the prospect of boosting efficiency and reducing costs for inter-bank settlements .. but to me this feels like its grossly minimizing the potential.  
Baby steps I suppose.

Also factor in that block rewards are constantly being awarded ... even if prices stay still the market cap will increase.  Couple that with new money entering and experiencing the alt-coin fascination (we've all had it) and viola .... 
That said, i used to be a bitcoin maximalist but i've since learned that's rather foolish and unnecessary.  I hope Bitcoin succeeds wildly and hold on to all my coins ... but that's no reason to no place a few honest wagers that other interesting projects will also do well and hang on for a long while.

I disagree.  Crazy is too strong a word ... unbelievable and remarkable would be more appropriate.  The likelyhood of reserve currency status is difficult to predict at this point but I would contend that if it were to actually happen, it wouldn't take 15 years.  It'd be earlier than that.  The acceleration of technology is obvious .. but the acceleration of the acceleration of technology is a more subtle though arguably more relevant factor.

Sorry I don't buy it.  He was just on Rogan.  He accepts BTC all day long because he is converting to dollars immediately... he believes no one wants the BTC, just the dollars ...so of course he'll allow those with BTC to transact that way if they choose.  He doesn't believe there is any value to BTC beyond us collectively attributing value to it randomly.  What he misses is that this is the first real case where intrinsic value of this network isn't in our collective beliefs but rather the programmatic protocol / trust network that will prove to be valuable (i.e. Providing trustless utility) to not just us humans ... but machines .. as we enter the realm of advanced AI.

Just to speak to these 3 points:
Because you can quickly replenish what you use and avoid the exchange of sensitive personal information in the process .. while also potentially saving the merchants 2-3% on credit card fees which for low margin companies translates to a large percentage.
There's always a chance it goes to 0, but the resilience of this system after 8 years of constant attack technically and politically is certainly astounding.
The system is quite a beautifully designed concept that has functioned remarkably well ... the bitcoin blockchain's heartbeat is strong inspite of years of decent and FUD.  For mining to be economical over time as the block reward is reduced, the price must rise to provide a commensurate incentive to continue the operations of securing the network such that the collected fees and newly minted coins still make viable sense to keep the machines on.  If it no longer makes sense, then that miner drops off .. if enough do, the hash rate drops until the it reaches a level where others were hoping to jump in and turn their machines back on.  Eventually the fees will be able to cover the entirety of the network security which commands an obviously higher price ... 
This technological social experiment interweaving game theoretical models and consensus is truly some genius work that begs for a little more critical thought and reading than simply waving an easy 'ponzi scheme' wand.  Read the white paper ... it's remarkable.

It's not a ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme.  It's an internet protocol with no central Wizard of Oz pulling any strings behind any curtains ... it's also without prior analog .. that is to say, there's never really been anything quite like this before so it's hard to come to grips with at first.  But it's WORTH learning about.. so start your research by watching a youtube video called Bitcoin for Beginners by Andreas Antonopoulus

Wow ... there are still people out there that believe Bitcoin is a ponzi?    All this shows is that you have lots of reading to do.  Bitcoin is a protocol.  It's the world's first technology that allows for digital scarcity and the transmission of digital value without the need for a third party intermediary.  There is no one that is sitting somewhere selling others bitcoin for a promise of a higher return.  You buy bitcoin at your own risk just as you did 5 years ago when no one but a tiny fringe group of people could see how transformative this tech is.  Seriously, it's pretty ignorant to say "pretty obviously a ponzi" ... sounds like you haven't a clue what you're talking about.

Saving is bad, mmkay?
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:30:03
Sorry ... are you being serious?  
Bitcoin is a better money .. cryptocurrencies are the best kind of money ... Til now, money had to be fungible, portable, durable, a store of value, and a unit of account.  Gold was all of those things and hence why it was used as money for 1000's of years ... the issue is that gold is heavy so it loses some points in the portability dept.  Then fiat currency (dollars/yen/etc) came around and they served as receipts for the gold until the gov't broke the tie of the dollar to gold... but people were so used to paper money they just kept with the collective illusion.. problem is fiat currency may fulfill most of the properties of a good money, but it absolutely is wretched as a store of value ... 
Enter cryptocurrencies ... they fulfill all of the properties of good money but with two MASSIVE upgrades from the industrial age as we enter this new DIGITAL age.    
They are portable, durable, fungible, a store of value, a unit of account, AND ... INSTANTLY TRANSFERABLE and PROGRAMMABLE. 
We are shedding the old industrial ways of organizing ourselves in society with centralized institutions and centralized money systems, .. those systems worked great in an industrial &amp; nationalized world .. but we now live in a digital, global world ... hence why those institutions are failing ... Bitcoin is the first instantiation of the next paradigm shift in money.
All aboard bitches.

Way to go!  now buy a little more ($10 worth or so) and play with it.. send it to a friend and have him/her send it back.  donate a few bucks to some worthy causes and then spend the balance .. you can pick up some hot sauce over at hot maple dot com or a little something at newegg, tigerdirect, etc.  It's just so much more impactful when you actually use it rather than hodl it... though hodling is necessary.

Welcome!  We get the "blockchain is awesome, bitcoin is nothing" comment a lot around here.  Stick around a while and you'll see that quite the opposite is true.  Also, the volatility you're referring to is actually quite mild for Bitcoin .. bubbles of years past have placed the recent price action to shame.  It's a technology in its infancy subject to all the massive valuation swings inherent to up-and-coming industries.... normally that is behind closed doors but with Bitcoin being open source, we all get a front row seat.  Regardless of the volatility, you could still benefit from Bitcoin's use by purchasing some bitcoin and making a purchase with the coins.  This would save the merchant credit card fees and would eliminate the need for you to entrust confidential information to more and more parties.  
You probably wouldn't believe me if i told you that the Bitcoin community's most ardent supporters were once the most hesitant skeptics.  If you care to learn more, just ask.  If you're just here to troll, you aren't providing value and may as well head back over to @_date: 2017-05-21 00:50:08

First comment gets it exactly right imo.  To quote:
"The idea that Bitcoin can be an efficient medium of exchange while not being a store of value is as flawed as the idea that a trusted blockchain alone can provide meaningful value. Both of these ideas fail on the same grounds. Intellectual laziness indeed."

I think it's great.  The more references to Bitcoin that can be salt and peppered into the conversation, the better.  A few % of folks watching most likely just said to themselves "That's the 7th time I've heard bitcoin mentioned in the last month.  Let me see what this thing is all about."

I share your prideful enthusiasm.  I have a client that was teasing me about bitcoin the other day at lunch in front of a group... i sat quietly and smiled.  when we got back to the office, i basically said "so... you were just going for cheap laughs right?  you're weren't actually serious about the ponzi stuff were you?" .. he admitted it was what he had heard and i took 15 min to give him a brief birds eye of bitcoin.  Intrigued, he asked to have a wallet setup.  Mycelium installed... i sent him $25 and had him send me $20 back.  "There.. you're not a proud bitcoin hodler."  ... I felt good that he appreciated how amazing it was that I had just sent him money that quickly and frictionless.  
Next day, I got a text.  "I just bought my first full bitcoin."
From ponzi to purchase in less than 24hrs.

nothing goes up in a straight line indefinitely ... if it did, you should be very worried ... this is actually very healthy.  Markets need to breathe .. the exhales allow for nice inhales later ... when markets don't breath *cough current stock market cough* .. things will end badly.  I actually welcome the down turns as it gives me an opportunity to save up and buy a little more once things look really dire... you know when you feel like you must have made a big mistake and should sell everything ... that's when I like to buy a little more.  We haven't hit that point yet on this downturn...

I know you're going the hardware wallet route but I figured I'd share what I'm doing and would love to get any input from the gallery here on whether it's a sound plan...
I've actually stored most of my funds on laminated paper wallets that are kept in a dark place away from UV light.  Several copies in fact though I still need to move a copy to an offsite location.  In addition to this tho, I scanned the paper wallet as a PDF and used Veracrypt to mount an encrypted container with which to store the PDF.  I then unmount the container and store the encrypted file on the USB.  I also send the encrypted file to my several emails for added redundancy.  
The written seeds for my hot wallets as well as the passwords are also encrypted in a separate container and stored the same way.  
Anyone see any issue with this method?  Other than its tough to convey to the spouse.......

i recently had an issue where i had purchased some BTC on Dec 7th with an expected delivery date of Dec 13th.  Dec 13th ended and I emailed them to ask the status.  They IMMEDIATELY responded and were looking into it .. asked me to give it another 24/48 hours and that the original delivery date is not exact .. can be earlier or later ... well .. still nothing as of Dec 17th ... emailed back.  They IMMEDIATELY responded again.  (Really impressive service).  Apologized for the obvious error and stated they would manually push the coins through.  Within 3-4 hours from that email, I received the coins.  This was my only "mishap" with coinbase .. otherwise have purchased multiple times before without issue.

the graph still exemplifies the emotional ride that repeats, as you mention, whenever there are these types of manias.  
I agree with you that BTC isn't globally integrated yet ... but I'd venture to guess that you'll see many more of these accumulation/rampup/blowoffs before BTC stabilizes on the other side of the S-curve.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:09:48
well haha .. not quite the moon just yet .. but certainly there's been a pattern here... 
Ramps to $15.40 in Aug 2012, correct by half to $7.7..settling at $10 to continue.
Climbs to $266, overcorrects to the $50s, settles near $130s to continue.
Ramps to $900 this week, corrects by half $450, perhaps more overcorrection, then settling near $600 to continue its climb..
Roughly 1600% appreciation from peak to peak the first time at 8 months apart.. roughly 240% appreciation peak to peak this time around 7 months apart ... if we got a mere 120% peak to peak next time we're looking at around $2000 in .. less than half a year?

If you sold today, after taxes I think you'd still eek out being a millionaire...give or take $100k.  Congrats man!  That's definitely tempting .. though I would tend to agree with other posters here in that you could cash out 90% of your stake and enjoy those benefits and let 10% ride.  Not a huge loss if it goes to zero considering you'd still be cashing out over a cool million... yet if it does catch on, you'd benefit from that as well.  Win win.  Just my 2 micro-bits.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:58:45

@_date: 2013-12-25 03:48:29
we're retesting the downward trend line here shortly... would need to break out on good volume ... then come back down to test that break out and then bounce back to confirm the down trend is broken... we had to catch up to the trend line again before making the next move ...hence the shallow oscillations over the last few days... volatility to resume shortly.
Just remember:  what's changed?  if it goes down, your fiat buys you more BTC .. if it goes up, you get warm and fuzzies...
I'd personally like it to drop again ... $300s would be nice but i'm skeptical now that we'll get there...

more than likely ... not yet.  Look at the weekly chart every now and then to get some perspective... look at week 4/10/2013.  Big down week .. lots of volume.  Then the next week it was up!  Up up and away right?  Wrong.  Next couple weeks brought more oscillation as we seeked a mean...likely to do the same here.
Give it time .. Bitcoin will take time to catch on.  It's very complicated despite it's simplicity and beauty.

let's take a page out of ebay's playbook here and develop a webpage that provides review ratings for merchants.  when you complete a transaction with a vendor, you can get linked to or otherwise go visit a webpage that allows you to provide feedback on the transaction.  With enough transactions, a quick 3 word positive feedback rating will add mere seconds to the back end of the deal and will become second nature.  It also provides a free market means of tallying the honest vendors against the frauds.  The community will let it be known if there are frauds out there and to STAY AWAY!  This will hurt their economic productivity and will need to make reparations if they are to remain viable.  The free market wins ... everytime.  :)
(Sorry if this idea has been mentioned already .. i just read these first few posts and thought I'd comment)

I agree with you completely.  Are they saying "It's illegal to own, use, transact, or even talk about bitcoin.  Anyone caught possessing bitcoin will be dragged into the street and shot".....?  
They're saying "yea... so use this at your own risk because if you get hacked or lose your digital ducats, there ain't shit we can do about it soo...yea..."  
There's no contesting that the popularity of Bitcoin has surged exponentially faster than the public's capacity to fully understand how to use this new exciting medium safely, securely, and comfortably.  Just cause we follow the utter latest news on BTC everyday doesn't mean everyone else does.... there are still people who can barely navigate their desktop let alone wrap their minds around booting a linux OS offline to generate secure keypairs....

The inherent beauty in all this is that "we'll figure it out".  We as in the market.  No central planner or round table of self-proclaimed elites to "decide" whats best for us.  If the problem is grave enough, the collective minds of millions of users will provide answer, tweak them, recalibrate, and solve the issue in the most efficient way possible.
Let the brainstorming begin :)
To your response though .. generally if you are involved in economic exchange with someone else, you typically like to know who they are .. you've probably done some research on their trustworthiness or you are aware of their trustworthiness through the acceptance of them by others i.e. big chain stores, well established mom &amp; pops, etc.  If you are transacting blind with some random and complete stranger whom cannot not provide references of their economic reputation, well then .. yes buyer beware.  But the same applies today. Do you buy a computer from newegg.com or do you buy it from a guy on craigslist that wants to meet in a back alley for the hand off... albeit an extreme example..
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:48:11
let's not forget that competition is a good thing.. albeit bitcoin has considerable advantage since it has paved the way and benefits from an established infrastructure, but given the right value proposition, a competing basket of CCs is expected and gets more people switching over to crypto vs fiat.  If you think it'll hurt bitcoin, it won't.  Inevitable cryptocoin flops will further legitimize bitcoins dominance but the open arena and potential for competition is a fantastic thing.  I suppose though that most are not used to the concept of competition when it comes to something like a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:51:06
part of that is that people may not realize that you don't have to buy a full bitcoin to get in.  that's part of the beauty .. though counterintuitive.. in that there's no company at the helm to advertise on how this works .. only you and me so to speak.  certainly not the US govt.

why are falling prices bad?  they're good!  we need to digest this MONSTER move that we've had these last two weeks... it can't go up further unless it shakes out the weak ... then it will come back stronger.  don't fret .. just stop looking at it.  ... lest you panic out thinking .. "geeeez .. ok i'll just sell and buy right back in when it goes down more.." and then BAAMMMM it's back up $100 - $200 before you know it and you're buying in higher.  Just walk away.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:21:38

well...i didn't think i needed to insert the "this is just my opinion .. anything could happen at any time" disclaimer .. but you're right, it probably belongs as there will be those who read reddit posts as fact.
merely offering some analysis from my perspective...in terms of evidence, you don't have to take my word for it .. take a look at past charts for various asset classes, stocks, gold, btc, etc... this is very typical behavior...though nothing is ever foolproof.  if it was, we'd all be millionaires with our blackbox programs cranking out the cheese.  ....as it turns out .. we did consolidate a bit til we tested that downward trendline.  looks like we've broken the trendline but not with a great deal of volume yet ... we'll see what happens in the next 12-18 hours.

I think he's going for "use bitcoin so that more merchants seeing it as a viable payment system to be part of hence exposing more clients to those options until BTC supplants [insert favorite fiat here]."
Edit:  This may be akin to "pay your recurring bills with your credit card every month (assuming you pay off the balance in full each month) so that you reap the small rewards" vs paying by check and getting zero.  Though these last few days, you'd better have everything lined up at the ready to pay for your desirables because 15 minutes from now you'll either need more BTC...or made 10%.

Can't upvote this one high enough.

why sell at all?  if you're holding it as speculation for eventual cash out .. then you're not really interested in bitcoin so much as you're interested in the next hot potato blazing through 4-digit % returns ... otherwise, i'd say .. even if it goes to the ultra high estimates of $1M, why not preserve that wealth i.e. purchasing power, in this clearly viable currency?  By that time, you'd be a fool as a merchant NOT to accept BTC .. so if you could purchase all your goods and services that way ... what would you be selling it for?  Dollars?  Really?...

I could be wrong here ... but I'm guessing Dogecoin is having it's 15 min of fame and will probably fade in about ... ooohh ho ho I see what you just did there.  Almost fell for that one ... the internet is capable of remaining stupid a lot longer than anyone's patience can remain solvent.

Just expressing a moment I experienced tonight where I would have liked to have had the choice.
Wasn't intending to discredit CCs on the merit of this experience alone.

This is exactly right... you could almost consider these as mini S-curves in one large enveloping S-curve of adoption.  People are attempting to invalidate Bitcoin's utility as a currency during the most volatile points in its growth.  
That's like being really hungry, finding a bag of oreos, being two oreos in and someone tries to brush your teeth.  
"This man's teeth will never be cleaned at this rate!! he's still eating oreos!!  this toothpaste is worthless!!" 
... chill.  Let the man finish the bag ...get a couple belches out ... he'll slow down once his belly has absorbed 27 of those 30 oreos.  Theeeeennn....brush his teeth.  Actually he can brush his own teeth.  He's a grown ass man.
Or if that's a bad analogy...this is a good read.

I know one thing .. we are part of stage 1 of the greatest wealth transfer in human history.  Not implying get rich quick, just that the entire infrastructure of how money is used, transferred, and maintained is being flipped on its head.  What an amazing time this is...

hmm.. speaking of wedges .. i see one on the hourly that looks like its bound to create some volatility real soon .. good call on the $750 as it's at $726 now .. but if it falls out of this rising wedge (bearish) .. then maybe we see $550 or sub $500 again. just guesses .. but wouldn't mind picking more up sub $500 myself. your continued thoughts?

needs to digest the move tho folks .. it's good for it to go down... helps it build a better base ... straight up in zero time is .. well... scary.
