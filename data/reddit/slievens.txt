Does that mean the BTC is lost forever to the 'waiting to send, limboland' ???

Has there been cases like this where the transaction hasn't bounced back to the original sending address?

I installed Electrum and imported the privkey -   
OK so I have sent from electrum and it IS coming up as a double spend -   
blockchain.info after me sending from electrum -

I believe the second transaction has forced the first to be confirmed and then forced the new transaction to be called a double spend and rejected. Just checking now.

Many thanks on the tips. At this rate the lost amount will be replenished :D

The other thing to take into account I suppose is the rate of the Bitcoin blockchain producing blocks. It is slow. In 3 days it probably hasn't had a huge amount of blocks found. I guess it will just take time or I have lost that Bitcoin forever :'(

OK so all is good. If this happens to anyone in the future, simply import your private key to electrum and send an amount equal or greater than the failed transaction, it will then detect a double spend, confirm and remove the previous errornous transaction and then double spend will be removed and will confirm.

OK. So download Electrum. Backup wallet on blockchain.info and insert into Electrums data folder and run. I guess I will have to send some Bitcoin to that address as it has only 0.00000003. Once that confirms I will send some btc to the same address as before. How do I issue the transaction that omits the dust input?

I cannot as the balance on there is 0.00000003BTC :(

@_date: 2014-11-16 12:35:36
Fingers crossed :D
@_date: 2014-11-16 11:30:12
I feared waiting would be the answer :/  Thanks for the tip btw ;)

Even though the title says 25 hours it has in fact been 36.
@_date: 2014-11-16 11:26:26
So in terms of it being rejected and then repopulating my wallet, how long am i potentially looking at?
@_date: 2014-11-16 11:41:59
This is blockchain.info response via email:  
Hello, Spencer! Any unconfirmed transactions will either eventually confirm or be rejected. Including a transaction fee of at least 0.0001 bitcoin will almost always assure that it gets confirmed faster. If it eventually is rejected, then the funds would appear in your wallet again. The only thing you can do at this point is to wait and see if the transaction is accepted into a block. Blockchain.info has no control over this, and cannot expedite transactions. This is always dependent upon the bitcoin network itself.

Good app for android users. I have Lumia :)

@_date: 2014-11-16 12:16:37
Yes. Unconfirmed. Double Spend. Just waiting for it to be rejected, wallet to propagate and then will be good and should be able to send ok.
@_date: 2014-11-16 12:47:07
Yep passworded but I'm moving back to blockchain.info and setting my min fee to 0.0002btc ;) -

Balance read correctly straightaway and didn't need to do any transactions.
