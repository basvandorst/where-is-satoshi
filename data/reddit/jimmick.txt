Thanks a million friend, pleasure doing business!
You should probably get your email out of here before it gets sniffed by someone naughty.

Not to mention buying up BTC on mtgox will encourage the growth of the currency!

There used to be a hidden wiki, but it got a bit of publicity and ended up shutting down. There's no real repository of sites anywhere.
Your best bet is scouring the bitcoin forums to catch illegal posts before they're deleted by mods.

Congratulations, you now have twelve cents.
Bitcoins aren't magical, they're a currency.

They have a number of legal and illicit purposes, same as cash does.
Best case scenario, widespread use and hyper deflation making all us early adopters millionaires.
Worst case scenario, bitcoins are hoarded and never circulated, no one accepts them anywhere and they fade into worthless obscurity.

The only viable way to mine bitcoins is using your GPU, even an ATI 6870 running at 300mhash/s for *two to three months* may not mine a single bitcoin.
You may want to read up a bit more on pooled mining, especially given that you may have misunderstood how it is mining exactly works.

We have a bunch of shitty shows about border security but they only ever pull aside foreigners and weird statues packed with heroin.

Would it be feasible to do dynamic retargets?

It's climbing back up pretty damn sharply.
There are thousands of .onion sites trading exclusively in very large quantities of BTC all over the place. BTC is the defining currency of darknet now.
