It's a multisig setup with yourself holding 2/3 keys. 
You keep key 1 on your machine, key 2 goes to trustedcoin and key 3 is stored securely somewhere else.
Normally key 1 and key 2 both sign a transaction. If trustedcoin goes down you can retrieve key 3 and transfer all your BTC elsewhere. If you are incapacitated your family can take key 3 and sign a transaction with trustedcoin to transfer your BTC out. Trustedcoin only has 1 key so the only way to spend BTC from your wallet is if you want to.

It uses the private key of your wallet to encrypt the chat so only you two can see it and no one else, not even Mycelium.

I guess he's in a USD wallet enabled state. So you can deposit funds into Coinbase over time but they'll still limit your maximum daily purchase to 10K.

If you mean using a bot please don't, they might discard all the votes and then blame Dogecoin for trying to "Hack" the system which would defeat the purpose.

Can you link me to some recent Ripple news? 
I really like the idea of Ripple but ever since McCaleb dumped his stash, Ripple imploded. Last I read anyway. And now Stellar is trying to carve its own niche.

Or option C
Use an ATM. It's the easiest way I've ever bought coins, you don't even need a wallet address because it can print one on the spot for you. Then feed in as many bills as you want and it continuously deposits btc into your account. It's great.

Actually in ios 8 3rd party keyboards will be available. And apple will create a system where apps can share data and communicate with each other. The AppStore has had multiple apps you can use to download torrents, though they tend to get taken down and put back up. You can use 3rd party mail apps no problem with ios. ios really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Especially if you jailbreak. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 01:56:56
Where was this?
@_date: 2014-11-04 02:46:54
It's 500 per payment method. If you add a card as well as your bank account you can instant buy 1000. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:07:09
Yes it's one way. A more accurate name would be a Bitcoin Vending Machine. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:49:03
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the coinkite card appears to just be a card with a qr code printed on it. And the actual debit card only works on the equipment that they sell: 
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:00:38
Yeah the interface is great!

I'm waiting for a solution to the 1mb transaction limit. If Bitcoin is going to replace cash, we need to figure this out. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:18:46

@_date: 2014-07-01 02:32:53
When I think of a Bitcoin debit card, I think of where you can send Bitcoin to a website and then that is how much I can spend on my card. Every time I buy something they'll subtract the equivalent in BTC from my account. No need for me to convert beforehand, they'll do it on the spot instantly. 
It sound like with the CaVirtrex card I would have to do the conversion beforehand myself. Is that right?
@_date: 2014-09-21 00:29:51
Yeah. The one I used didn't require anything until $2000 in one transaction. Of course you can come back and do 1999 every time. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:41:49
That's going to be hard. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 02:31:24
Yep, just don't tell Coinbase your actual age.

Thanks man! 
The Meetup is on Thursday, can you make it?
@_date: 2014-09-03 15:27:07
Digital currency? Absolutely. 
Bitcoin itself? I'm not so sure. Bitcoin won't be able to incorporate innovations of alt coins. It's only a matter of time until something truly superior to bitcoin in every manner will be released and bitcoin won't be able to compete. 
However that point is still far off. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:56:36
Sounds like a good idea. Maybe dollars for essentials like the hotel and tickets and then BTC for the shops and restaurants?

? It got updated so it's inline with ios 7 design standards. I find that it works well for my needs. Take a look at it, it's much better than the old one still on Cydia. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:17:15

Is there a linear version of this?
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:44:02
You'd have to wait for the seller to receive the packages though, which at best would take days. There are faster ways to buy BTC ranging from instant to same day.

I believe you could use nlocktime for that. If you don't send the coins to a new address before nlocktime activates then it'll automatically send to your specified address.

It's how we're getting around regulations. Requirements for a vending machine are far more lax than all the red tape around atms. 
By framing Bitcoin as a commodity and having only one way machines, owners have a lot less hassle to deal with.

@_date: 2015-01-28 09:10:47
It's unnecessary. Each Bitcoin is divisible to the 8th place, ie 100 Million Satoshi makes one Bitcoin. If a single coin becomes to scarce/expensive everyone could use millibits or bits instead.
