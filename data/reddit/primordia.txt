Yeah, the dump has issues for me too. I extracted my transactions with grep and brought them into a spreadsheet. Even after reconciling the duplicate transactions (same transaction numeric id, but one from mtgox.csv one from coinlab.csv, slightly different amount in Bitcoin_Fee but everything else the same)...  the numbers just aren't adding up correctly. I made a spreadsheet column simulating my btc/usd holdings after each transaction - it thinks I still hold over 50 coins (which I don't), and sometimes the intermediate "gox usd" balance is -$5000 or so.

Not entirely - I've read discussion on here that BTC isn't subject to wash sale rules like stocks are.

I started on Gox in March 2013 and they never sent me emails like this.

Yes, you are correct. My trade history was incomplete as well. It's hard to know what we can actually infer from this data when that's the case.

Right, my hypothesis here concerns the scenario where someone had a keylogger on their computer... in which case email would be compromised as well. The confirmation/cancellation emails could be filtered away to Spam, if for example you had Gmail. The account being locked thing is a good point though - hopefully someone would notice within 2 weeks.
I just see a lot of posts about how "turn on 2-factor and you're secure if your computer gets hacked" and wanted to point out that 2-factor isn't a magic bullet... it can, as this page shows, still be worked around.

But moving coins from a personal/offline wallet to an exchange doesn't.

Right, I'm under the same impression. In any case wiring directly to MtGox Japan was a lot faster for me (&lt;24 hours) than Dwolla would have been.

I agree that the account verification stuff is a pain in the ass.. still waiting for 30 days for Dwolla/Coinbase to go through.
Sending fiat turned out to be a lot easier than I expected though. I internationally wired funds to MtGox Japan yesterday at 9:30 am. I just woke up with fiat in my mtgox in under 24 hours (instead of the 2-5 days plus one for AML they said it would take). Bought coins and had them in my wallet within 30 seconds.

Where are you getting that from? I've never seen that mentioned anywhere in BTC-related topics before.

One time key generated by the Yubikey/Google authenticator.

I'm not perfect on the details, but what I've picked up from lots of lurking is that:
* mtgox's trade matching algorithm is slow in that when a (non-market) bid comes, it has to cycle through all of the asks to see if one matches. And vice versa for the asks. This means that the more bids and asks there are, the slower things are.
* When things lag out too much, people panic and sell because they don't have faith in MtGox, which causes the price to drop. 
* In this way, there's an incentive for manipulators to create lag: let the price pick up a bit, sell all their coins, place buy orders at a lower price, then lag gox to all hell so that everyone else sells and the price drops and they get cheap coins.
* Placing lots of tiny orders helps skew the 'last' price creating a ladder to lower prices - instead of one big trade causing a momentary dip and then possibly surging right back, the fact that there's lag means a bunch of people will sell at MARKET (e.g. last) price. So if you create a ladder of tiny transactions from 100.1, 100, 99.5, 99, 98.5, and so on, if people blindly hit sell during the lag you've created, they follow your price path downwards, which sustains support for these lowered prices while lag persists.
