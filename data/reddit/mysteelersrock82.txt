Can you even sell tainted bitcoins from wasabi?
@_date: 2019-07-28 17:31:19
You should also add what the best wallets are
@_date: 2019-07-21 06:06:57
Only on leap years
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:19:03
Where’s this coming from
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:55:24
It’s also a store of value to hedge against corrupt government officials
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:48:41
Looks like a guarantee
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:00:21
There’s lightning wallet
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:31:44
I would say more
@_date: 2019-11-29 18:30:06
@_date: 2019-11-18 22:15:49
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:32:12
What apps have you used? The mobile apps couldn’t be easier to use.
@_date: 2019-11-24 00:38:17
Probably a dumb question, but what’s UTxO hygiene?
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:23:05
Either or 
@_date: 2019-11-26 02:13:49
Please do
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:22:21
Definitely will after reading up on it haha
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:59:34
Why the hell are you giving out reddit gold?!
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:49:22
Dude he literally doesn’t even say to invest in bitcoin. He says to invest in your own personal skills
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:55:26
Nice wiener
@_date: 2019-08-23 17:55:29
Fuck yeah. Noob friendly lightning wallets are exactly what are needed for mass adoption! Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2019-08-02 01:19:27
Find a better solution? I really don’t want to use bisq because some of those can be tainted
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:24:58
So which wallets and services should we be using? I know ledger has Native SegWit
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:32:21
People still use google?
@_date: 2019-08-25 17:18:30
No, actually it’s not. Watch the video you mutt
@_date: 2019-08-23 20:53:27
Excellent video! This should have more upvotes!
@_date: 2019-08-26 19:41:58
This needs to be at the top. Absolute must read.
@_date: 2019-10-03 01:09:25
I predict Bitcoin at 100000000 usd by 2020
@_date: 2019-08-26 20:22:29
Just cross posted in r/economics 
I’m interested to hear counter arguments as well
@_date: 2019-08-10 17:10:50
Lay off the weed
@_date: 2019-08-25 17:26:13
So who do you watch then?
@_date: 2019-10-05 00:12:20
All of this money was paid back and shortly taken back out of the system. What’s concerning about this is the fact that they’re proving they won’t hesitate to step in and adjust money supply as they feel necessary
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:25:37
How much hash would be required for a 51% attack on Bcash
@_date: 2019-12-01 01:24:24
Welcome aboard!! The learning curve can be steep but the community is always eager to answer questions
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:51:21
How doesn’t it? Clearly you’ve never used lighting. Instant, private, and cheap transactions.
@_date: 2019-12-27 18:10:08
Awful vpn
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:50:17
Vanilla gift card?
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:51:08
Bitcoin has the best network security and largest community. 
Litecoin does nothing special and I would not invest in it. The whole silver to Bitcoins gold is an awful analysis because the real world metals actually have use cases.
Ethereum is an interesting product and wouldn’t be a bad investment. The biggest issue is that they are switching from POW to POS and this could cause unexpected issues to arise.
@_date: 2019-12-28 19:27:40
1st layer. Lightning network doesn’t have a tx/sec cap
@_date: 2019-12-27 19:21:25
No problem and glad I could help
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:46:26
What would happen if everyone with coins on coinbase moved them to personal wallets?
@_date: 2019-12-01 01:25:34
It’s not expensive to transact
@_date: 2019-12-27 19:06:25
So the vpn itself has good speed but they just got bought out by an unethical company and the jurisdiction is USA. I would go with either Mullvad or ProtonVPN. Both have good jurisdiction laws and are privacy focused
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:12:37
You should make a post emphasizing this to get more exposure 
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:05:31
This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:38:45
Wow, great response with some solid points. I think everyone is worried about privacy, but to my understanding bitcoins first priority is security on the 1st chain and then privacy can come on the 2nd. Do you agree with this approach, or do you think privacy should be the main concern even if it means being attacked by governments?
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:42:04
Make sure you educate yourself. First thing you should do is buy a hardware wallet if you’re buying $15k worth
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:22:05
You the best!
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:23:16
Low key want it to keep dropping so I can buy for dirt cheap 
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:27:02
Yes but have fun with the fees 
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:37:44
What do you think will trigger normies coming back in? Adoption?
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:54:53
Do you receive compensation for running a LN node?
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:00:17
How would bitcoin as a currency not work?
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:52:45
Okay so what happens if the US government falls off the rails and causes the currency to do the same?
Bitcoin is backed by trustless algorithms and computing power which gives the currency its value.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:13:42
Except we can’t even actually elect people who we want in power lmao. Big companies with all the money have ultimate say over who gets elected and is in office. Not the people. For example, say company A needs a various deed done by the government and is willing to pay money to help a candidate campaign. Once the candidate gets elected, the deed is performed no matter how much society likes or dislikes it. 
Then you also have to look at how the parties themselves rig elections. Look at Bernie in 2016. They literally rigged the primary against him. If I knew that we were truthfully voting people to power who I could trust and know that they wouldn’t be influenced by outside influences then I would have no problem trusting “government officials”
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:33:40
You could still issue debt with bitcoin... just have bitcoin as the reserve currency. This would solve your issues, and it wouldn’t allow a central authority to increase money supply as they please
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:10:43
Except we live on a planet with finite supplies. Constant growth, especially current growth rates, can not go on forever. Look at Europe.
@_date: 2019-09-20 03:09:35
This is incredible. Hopefully fees aren’t too extensive. I don’t understand how this doesn’t have more upvotes since this is a legit game changer if properly pulled off
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:11:09
Would be a waste of money and effort
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:07:11
Thanks dude!
@_date: 2018-12-06 08:16:25
Appreciate it!!
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:51:00
Where do you advice buying then?
