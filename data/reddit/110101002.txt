If miners want, they can activate at any value above 50%. 95% is just a very safe number in that range so it is the threshold for this "attempt".
@_date: 2016-04-03 11:42:06
It doesn't. My post was explaining how the trend in ASIC hardware efficiency effects hardware decentralization, and separately it discussed the problem of outsourcing validation.
@_date: 2016-04-02 16:53:09
ASIC hardware efficiency is increasing less every month. As this trend continues, I expect we'll see less farms, less manufacturers mining their own hardware and more individuals mining. What farms have right now is the advantage of the ability to quickly and easily get the next generation of ASICs. It costs money to ship out a single ASIC and you are losing money every day that ASIC is depreciating while in the mail. With less optimization, ASICs become outdated less quickly, and with them becoming outdated less quickly, the ASICs tend to not go to those who can mine on them the most quickly, but instead those who can mine on them for the cheapest electricity cost, which tend to be individuals heating their homes with ASICs.
Now this is pretty useless if these individual miners are outsourcing their block validation to a third party. The best way to prevent this outsourcing is to make the validation easy and fast. This means there must be easy to use decentralized pools and low-cost, high-speed validation of blocks, which can be accomplished through a small-enough block size.

You have a fundamental confusion about this issue.


These are also not mere hypotheticals... in 2013 as blocksizes grew mining became incredibly centralized with almost all the hashrate being pointed at just a couple large pools in order to mitigate orphan rate; this actually enabled pool compromise theft on the scale of 1000 BTC from a Bitcoin using service. Matt created the block relay protocol to mitigate the bandwidth mediated pressure towards centralization and it has helped push back the clock on that; we already know from experience how the system responds to scaling pressure: it centralizes because centralization directly, immediately, and without any coordination divides the scaling costs. Centralized is the most efficient configuration of the system.
--Greg Maxwell
This is one dimension of the problem that you have a half-way understanding of. You understand that there exist nodes that can operate with larger blocks, but you don't understand that they won't necessarily operate just because they can. You could make every full node operator pay $10 more per month, and they could pay, but why would they pay when they can just pay nothing externalize the costs in the form of reduced network safety.
Once again, this is only one dimension of the problem, there are many ways this harms Bitcoin and it is foolish to ignore them. I dug up an old summary of the problems for you:
* What software should the core developers make available? If I were to dictate to the developers what they should do I would ask first that they not violate the security of Bitcoin. An important component of Bitcoin is trustlessness, without it, we might as well drop the blockchain and pick up a more efficient system. There are other goals one might have like "does this keep Bitcoin cheap" or "is this what Satoshi said he wanted", however I don't see the point of achieving these goals if loss of trustlessness is the cost.
General mining situation:
* So does increasing the blocksize put trustlessness in jeopardy? Like most things in security it isn't black and white. The mining ecosystem becomes less secure and more centralized when there is a larger network load. It is a reaction that is caused by the cost of supporting the networks security becoming greater than its benefits. For example, every mining pool member could effectively take the control back from the pool and generate their own blocks, causing a huge decrease in the trust we are required to put in these pools. There is, however, a cost to these individual miners running a full node including additional latency for the pool users, additional resources for the pool if they are using the relay network, and many many other factors that increase as the block size increases.
Benefits to big miners:
* This isn't limited to individual miners in pools either, a certain Chinese mining pool was not validating blocks due to the stales that would be caused, though this can be improved partially with IBLT. The cause of the pool not validating was that their geographic separation from other mining pools made it more expensive to mine fully validating. It actually is very efficient to have all your miners in a geographically centralized area, like a single warehouse, and it becomes even more efficient as the network load increases. In general, as blocks become bigger there is a centralizing effect to the mining ecosystem and that causes the requirement of trust, the antithesis of Bitcoin.
Getting small miners to run full nodes:
* I usually get responses like "These miners can afford to run full nodes", but the question isn't whether they can run full nodes, it is whether they will! At what point does a miner benefit from a full node? A 0.1% miner may realize that the expenses of running a full node cut into their profits by 5%, and then through a rough estimate realize that their 0.1% of hash power belonging to a large mining pool doesn't harm the network, and by extension them that much. This leads to them not running a full node. The minimal hash power required for "profitable" validation varies based on factors including the loss of profit through latency caused by geographic placement, the gain in personal "profit" through the enjoyment that comes from running a full node as a hobby. However, as a general trend, the minimal hash power someone will run a full node at decreases and the cost of a full node increases.
Decreasing attack cost with higher network load: 
* At this point, this economy of scale induced effect has led to miners being massive, the largest two miners individually can both reverse a confirmation with 40% probability of success. Combined, they can reverse 6 confirmations with 75% success. This is quite dangerous considering that a single government may attack Bitcoin relatively cheaply, or a profit-seeking miner may decide to attack as we have seen before with the 3000BTC GHash.io theft.
Increasing attack benefit with higher network load:
* One of the main differences between a miner attacking an SPV-using merchant and a full-node-using merchant is the ability to forge money out of thin air that can't be spent in a reorg. If you, an economical and malicious miner, want to rip off a merchant running a full node, you need to send them YOUR (or your partners) money and **then** spend your hashing power (money) attempting to steal their money. When you rip off a merchant running an SPV node, you can create money out of thin air, create invalid blocks, then be guaranteed that your payment will be reversed. There is no up front cost other than the electricity of your mine and you can block withhold to make your attack much more likely to succeed than the reorg attack mentioned in the full node example. In short, many SPV nodes make miner attacks much more profitable and likely to succeed. But it's not like full nodes don't have to be worried, they too can be caught up in the attack because including a full node target in the attack doesn't cost additional mining resources. The number of full nodes online doesn't matter nearly as much as the number and fraction of merchants validating payments with full nodes.
* We must consider this centralizing effect caused by large blocks and work towards making mining decentralized and the ecosystem safer by reducing the system load. This can be accomplished by having the blocksize increase at a rate lower than the rate at which hardware and software changes decrease the expenses caused by block size.

If you want to see what is actually censored in this thread, I can give you some examples:




Basically only shitposts meant to stir the pot and halt rational discussion.
Removal of this noise greatly improves the quality of discussion, it makes it so you don't have to sort through the noise, it stomps out a culture of noise (what you see on the alternative subreddits), and it allows signal producers to keep posting without having to waste time reading and responding to noise.
Before you respond, think about the effects reduction of noise has on a subreddit, and then think about the quality of discussion on the other bitcoin subreddits. Think about the effect the culture of the community has on its quality of discussion.

No, I just assumed you meant ordering. I didn't know why you would mention that scores didn't change based on ordering. Obviously if you re-sort it, Reddit doesn't change scores, it only changes ordering. That isn't the problem.


No, I am saying that because as demonstrated by this thread, has many people that evaluate content by score, rather than factuality, sorting by controversial and removing vote count forces people to think about factuality. This takes away one of the strongest weapons those who oppose reason have, decreasing credibility and censoring through downvotes


If you're talking about the members of the "public" that are brigading and benefit from the default sort order being "best", then yes, this is absolutely negative for them. I only really care about the members of the public that want to learn, and those members benefit from not having facts and reason hidden from view.

The intentions are good: creating an environment in facts and reason are easy to find while getting rid of the FUD and trolling. 
The problem that has arisen is those spreading this FUD and trolling have been banned and created their own subreddit. This subreddit primarily focuses on threads within and brigading them.
Group think within that subreddit has led to extreme views. It is a problem with most subreddits, they see something that supports their view ("Blockstream is evil", "There are literally no costs to larger blocks", "The mods are nazis") and upvote it. So, not only is their base view, "larger blocks are beneficial", supported, but the extreme views I mentioned are developed and solidified as well.
I think there are only two directions to go, decrease moderation, which leads to more users here spreading lies and FUD, but the diaspora leads to less circlejerking. Or, there could be heavily increased moderation, where you create an even more extreme troll den, and everyone for large (or small) blocks arguing truthfully here.
It would be an annoyance for me as a moderator, but the only way to end the [Peter__R Algorithm]( is to cut off the trolls completely. Right now, in our environment where subtle/gray-area trolling is allowed, the tactic is very successful.

**Just one nitpick:**


I don't think it has been impossible, it has just been difficult. It is possible to pay for rewards in fiat, just not as easy.
**Now, your design:**


Making this decentralized is a lot harder than doing it in a centralized manner. If you want to allow the work to be generalized, you will likely need to use bleeding-edge crypto, mainly SNARKS.
A pool model would be much easier. You computer 1000 or so work units, you dish out these 1000 work units to various different parties. The work unit consists of the algorithm they're running and list of outputs that *may* be in the set of inputs they're searching (you can't always have just one output or they will stop the work once they found it). Their work consists of them solving the problem for inputs N through M, and trying to find any of the possible outputs you have found. Their proof of work is them giving you the input corresponding to the output. If they prove work, they get paid. If they sove the problem, they get paid disproportionately.


This doesn't make any sense to me. The proofs can be as compact as an input and a corresponding output. If someone is sending an invalid proof, then you can add to their IPs ban score.


Using Java certainly doesn't make arbitrary execution vulnerabilities disappear.  I'd recommend research into sandboxing tools.


It seems you are hoping the user doesn't change his code so it lies to the server? This isn't a safe model. Once again, I would recommend copying the mining pool model.

He asks all his friends to applaud him when he asserts some fact, and he ignores the teacher as they request proof and for his friends to leave or stop disrupting the class.

Independently, the facts that it would be a hard fork and the fact that it would centralize the system both demonstrate that it is not less risky. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 03:19:16
This has been discussed to death. The blocksize limit exists to restrict large miners from centralizing the system. Miners setting their own limits doesn't help the problem at all, and a soft fork can only occur if you can get the large miners which benefit from large blocks and centralization on board.

The only thing the pool model would do is reduce their variance. You don't need people working on the same problem. For example, if I have a problem where I want a user to exhaust 500 million inputs, I may give them a share for 5,000 of the outputs so rather than earning $2,000 after exhausting all 500 million inputs, they earn 2 cents after exhausting only 100,000 inputs.


This can be generalized to any stochastic search.


It documents how it works, but not why it works, which I believe it doesn't in its current state.


You aren't making any sense. You want them to solve the problem, but not prove they solved the problem? The proof of work is the solution itself.


I'm not sure what you mean... If they have the program running on their computer they can change its behavior. Either your solution doesn't work here, or its explanation doesn't make sense.


Right, so rather than expending computational resources, they just reverse engineer it.

As I explained, it happened because miners were SPV mining. Core devs were acting under the assumption that miners weren't behaving in the ridiculous and dangerous way you're advocating. Typically 95% of miners being honest/correct means Bitcoin should be safe, and 95% should be a sufficient threshold, but under the system you're proposing where miners do the harmful thing, not the sensible thing, 95% may not be safe. This isn't only bad because softforks are less safe, it is bad because a very small miner can attack the network easily.

This is the best post I've ever seen going over both sides of the issue in a neutral manner.
If you are still interested in expanding on this. Here is a list of links further explaining the history of Bicoin centralization and blocksize: 
Edit: Also, it's worth mentioning that users joining larger pools isn't the only problem, and large pools aren't fundamentally a problem if they use something like GBT or are P2Pool. The problem arises when someone controls a bunch of hashpower and they are unchecked. A trusty pool (hardware owners connecting to pool don't validate blocks themselves) is an example of that, as well as a mining warehouse.
* As the block size increases, the cost of the hardware owners nodes increases as well and they are more likely to outsource their validation to another party (often their pool), increasing centralization.
* As the block size increases, the cost of being geographically separated increases since the orphan rate becomes higher. Of course, your ASICs in your warehouse have basically no distance between them, meaning they have almost no orphan rate. In other words, larger blocks make warehouses more cost effective.
* As the block size increases, it puts a general stress on the system, which shows up in some other unexpected places. For example, it was found that the F2Pool and Antminer were trusting each others headers because waiting for the entire large block to propogate caused too many orphans and lost them too much money. This action effectively made a massive 45% pool.

It is honestly nice to see you criticizing Theymos because you appear to be someone who hasn't been polarized and criticize people on both sides. Polarization is the primary problem here. If you believe that BIP101 is good, you end up agreeing with people who are more likely to believe more absurd opinions, such as that Blockstream is evil, that there is some mass conspiracy of Blockstream paying mods, etc. On our side, I've seen some people claiming that Mike Hearn is some evil guy because he is helping banks use blockchain technology (for the record, I don't think R3CEV is evil or anything, but it may be a waste of time).

[A non-majority miner can gain a large competitive advantage and centralize the system further. We need to protect ourselves from even semi-large miners.](
[An increase in the number of transactions causes a growth in the block size which in turn increases the verification delay and the transmission delay at each hop in the propagation. This introduces an economy of scale, every time the blocksize gets bigger, big miners benefit from having 0% propogation time to their share of the network, while other miners don't have this advantage](

Because you are completely going on a tangent. The discussion was about how miners should run full nodes to help with decentralization. It is known that miners aren't required to run a full node, the entire problem is based around the fact that miners aren't running full nodes. So why exactly have you gone on this tangent to discuss the reasons miners join pools? It is completely going over your head. Miners can run full nodes and solo mine, miners can run full nodes and pool mine, miners can not run full nodes and pool mine, miners can not run full nodes and solo mine (though pooling is generally desirable so it isn't common). RUNNING A FULL NODE AND REDUCING VARIANCE ARE SEPARATE. I don't know how to explain this any more clearly when your logic seems to skip aronud so much. Your statement is a non-sequiter and seems to be something along the lines of "pools don't force people to run full nodes therefore we don't have to worry about miner centralization".
TL;DR: you're not wrong because you didn't address the problem at all, you just made a factual statement about the state of mining.

Absurd misinformation. 1mb certainly wasn't safe 10 years ago. It's hardly safe now.
There is a lot of confusion around these numbers. Measurements of what the blocksize should be isn't based on what a single computer can process, it is based on what the Bitcoin network can safely handle. Right now the median bandwidth between a miner and half the other miners is 723Kb/s.
If you want to have a centralized currency run from your computer, then you don't have all the constraints of decentralized consensus. I'll agree the transaction volume can be much higher in that case, because a currency is only constrained by what your computer can process. However, when we talk about a decentralized consensus based currency, we don't operate on the requirements of a single node, we operate on the requirements of keeping the network running and maintaining its security assumptions, which include decentralization
@_date: 2015-06-08 11:37:29


Actually Bitcoin, left as it is, doesn't have the property you're describing. The untra-decentralized store-of-value (both good properties) coin, or what I think you're referring to, the 1MB block limit currency, is the default and bitcoin doesn't have to be "made into" it.
Also, the anti-spam measures are in software permanent. You seem to be implying the critical feature of the block size limit is spam prevention, however right now the main purpose it serves is maintaining decentralization.
I'm not sure why people poke fun at the anti-block-size-increase camp for wanting a decentralized currency, is it not understood by the community that Bitcoin is useless without decentralization?

Your FUD is absurd:


WTF do you mean by a stealth change? Your phrasing is unjustified and indicates that you are trying to get the fanatics on your side riled up. The change was announced, and plainly visible in the code. This process has been done many many times in Bitcoin. Only difference here is the miners were trusting other miners headers, which created what was effectively a 45% pool. 
Remember, this fork was an **accident** caused by a very small miner being incorrect. It could happen today intentionally due to SPV mining through a miner being dishonest. Complaining about the devs in this context basically means you are accepting the security assumption that Bitcoin will never have a 2% miner attacking, because rather than talking about the fact that a 2% miner caused a massive fork due to SPV mining, you complain about the fact that an upgrade caused a 2% miner to **accidentally** be wrong.
In short, if you accept in your model that a 95% threshold is reckless and can cause a prolonged fork, then you are also accepting that Bitcoin is cannot have a 5% attacker and be safe.


This is analogous to how individuals who do SPV mining are making a calculated bet, based on the trust that the pools they're connected to deserve, and will be punished if they trust a pool that is producing invalid blocks.
If a mining pool has 20% of the hashrate, and two peered pools at 20%, which are SPV mining, that is very similar to the pool controlling 60% of the hashrate through miners alone.

Contentious needs to be defined. If contentious means "majority opposition", I am fine with not adding software that will break consensus from the majority. If contentious means "opposition of at least one person" I think that is problematic.
Mike Hearn said that he would become XTs central authority for the time period that a majority of miners were still requiring 1MB blocks. That easily fits either definition of contentious... at least I think the Bitcoin community isn't dumb enough to accept software that has Mike Hearn (or anyone) as a central authority.

Quantum Computers can do some tasks quickly. One of these tasks is prime factorization. A quantum computer successfully factored 56153, beating the prior record of 143. As the semiprimes a quantum computer can factor become larger (much larger than 56153), the security of some forms of public key cryptography become worthless (such as RSA), it is also an indicator of the discrete log problem having a efficient solution through quantum computing, making ECDSA vulnerable as well. We will need to move to different forms of public key cryptography, post-quantum cryptography. Hashing and symmetric cryptography are mostly safe from quantum attacks (takes sqrt time with quantum computers).

Because his economic argument is that the cost of processing a transaction can be used to make mining profitable, but this gravitates towards centralization. This is because the cost of processing a transaction is mostly the same for each miner, while the reward isn't. This means the all miners costs are mostly the same and only the biggest miner can make a profit, forcing centralization.

If you read that and didn't catch the problem you probably don't have a very good understanding either (actually you have proved this to me already plenty of times). The most obvious flaw is that the cost of running a full node cannot be the reward for mining without centralization.
However, if you think centralization is fine, then Bitcoin isn't for you, you should stick to centralized currencies, there are plenty of them already.

The number of full nodes was declining as the price rose. SPV wallets use is independent with running a full node, you can have an SPV wallet with a full node. Even so, pure full node count doesn't matter as much as the ease of running a full node, they just happen to be correlated.


Yes, as I have mentioned, Bitcoin isn't supposed to be centralized. Consensus among core devs doesn't matter much.


We need enough decentralization to keep Bitcoin reasonably trustless. If we have to trust an entity, we might as well not have a Bitcoin.

Good question, don't see why you're being down-voted.
Number of nodes somewhat correlates with the number of merchants full-node validating. The primary use-case of of full nodes (other than mining) is reducing risk when accepting payment, so more merchants running them is a good thing. Full nodes prevent miners from (assisting in) faking payments with invalid transactions. A merchant accepting payments using a full nodes is beneficial to not just them, but the whole network because the total reward paid to a miner for defrauding users decreases. So, while the number of full nodes can be an indicator for the likelihood of a merchant running a full node, it isn't a perfect measure, it is easy to manipulate through sybil attacks, and in general doesn't really measure any important aspects of decentralization (as long as there are a sufficient number of nodes).
Number of miners isn't a measure at all. A brief example: Currency A has 100 miners, all with 1% of the hashrate. Currency B has 1,000 miners, but one miner has 80% of the hashrate. Currency A is quite decentralized, but it has 1/10th the miners Currency B has, and Currency B is very centralized.
Now, for your actual question:
Decentralization, in terms of Bitcoin means that no group has control over the currency, and no group can change attributes of it you don't agree to. Any changes require the decentralized network to decide to change, the authorities don't have the power to do that.
So let's examine Bitcoins centralization:
Consensus code, the code that determines which blockchain is correct, and which transactions are valid, has been mostly protected throughout Bitcoins history. Backwards-incompatible changes have been avoided at all costs since v0.3 (or arguably v0.1). v0.3 clients should agree with you on which blockchain is the tallest valid blockchain, and which transactions are valid, assuming a supermajority of honest miners. The consensus code is changed in a backwards compatible way in order to make updates. There have been cases where the consensus was broken, such as the 0.8 fork, however to preserve the decentralization ethos a softfork was performed which allowed old versions to once again be in agreement on transaction validity.
In terms of consensus code decentralization, I believe the weak point here is that many people simply download from bitcoin.org without validating the binaries.
I am of the opinion that the main centralization threat, particularly with regards to large blocks, is miner centralization. Even if you are fully-validating, large miners can play tricks, including reversing transactions with some probability of success approaching 100% as their size approaches 50%. I won't explain why large blocks can create miner centralization here, but if you're interested [I wrote about it here](

Lets imagine that we do get to the point that people are running miners in their homes to save on heating costs. How much will this device cost for an individual to run? $0/kwh since they require the heat already. Now, how much would this cost 21 inc? Somewhere below $0.04/kwh in Iceland plus some miner cooling costs.
Now, consider that a home could require 6,000khw/year to be heated in even the warmer parts of the west. That is a saving of $240/year, or an increase in miner profits of $240/year when the device is run in a home.
So the question becomes, what is the better option for 21? To run an ASIC that depreciates in a year and earn a profit of $N? Or to allow a homeowner to make $N + $240/year in profit, and split the $240 difference, charging the homeowner $120 more?
Well the way I posed my question, it makes it appear obvious that they will go to homes in that scenario. There may be some variables I'm not considering correctly or the cost of shipping may be wrong, however on the surface it seems like the natural path of ASICs is to decentralization.

BTCNuggets was being honest and hadn't indicated that that they would validate with the new rules. If the Chinese pools had done the same, then the fork wouldn't have happened in the first place. The fact is anyone could have caused that fork. Even a 0.01% miner could have created a bad block and the Chinese pools that were SPV mining would have built on it. You can blame the 0.01% miner for making a bad block, but the disruptors that caused harm to the network was the 45% pair of miners that weren't validating.


Yeah, pull the race card, that is the core of the issue, racism /s


It isn't the devs fault, I've already explained why, stop spreading lies. You need to own up to your mistakes and admit that either you were wrong, or that you indeed believe that Bitcoin should operate in a way that causes the system to have a huge failure if a single invalid block is produced.


No it wouldn't. A 51% threshold could result in a fork lasting an entire day, and in general a very unstable consensus. The reason the 95% threshold exists is that a fork, especially a long one, becomes unlikely at that point, assuming that the miners are being sensible and not SPV mining that is.
General alerts and a grace period can't always get you to 100%, which is what would have been required to prevent the harm caused by SPV miners. And **once again, remember** this wouldn't result in safety from an actual attacker, this would only result in safety where every single miner is honest.
There are two options here:
* Your suggestion: Have the devs make sure all (100.000%) of the miners are on the latest version so that we don't accidentally create an invalid block, which will be built upon and cause significant harm to the network. Also assume that 100% of the network is honest 100% of the time and that a very small 0.02% miner doesn't decide it is in his best interest to short Bitcoin and use his 0.02% hashrate to 45% attack Bitcoin using the 45% who are SPV mining.
* My suggestion: Fix the actual problem SPV mining problem and don't use some absurd security through obscurity tactic in order to give the network a false sense of safety. Require a miner to actually have 45% of the hashrate to 45% attack.

Not hand waving, you just stated pools are a problem when they clearly aren't.


Your orphan rate is related to the size of the blocks of other miners. You need to validate their blocks before you can start mining on their blocks. If you are still validating, or waiting to receive their block, you may mine a block in that time that isn't on top of theirs and is staled.


Yeah, it makes it so they don't have to waste any electricity, and we can just have a fiat paradigm. But since I'm not interested in making mining easy unless it makes Bitcoin better, I don't care.

... it really doesn't. The real world data shows the mining ecosystem becoming more centralized due to block size pressures.

Security? Helping the network and giving values to your assets?


They weren't resource hogs in 2009-2010 because the block size was low.  SPV clients have existed for a while and people are still stopping their full nodes. It isn't a sudden migration anymore, it's just people deciding to stop dedicating resources to a still-increasing cost.


It doesn't matter if the businesses run a full node if the mining network is centralized.

A soft limit doesn't solve the centralization problem. 8MB isn't a compromise, Gavin just named a crazy high block size, assumed centralization wasn't a failure mode and went forward.

Trustlessness is the advantage Bitcoin has over other currencies. Increase in block size leads to less full nodes and more trust needed.

You could have proved me wrong and told me how mining isn't an equilibrium and revenues increasing lead to increased permanent profits for all and how higher profits lead to decentralization. Instead you have chosen to ignore the logic laid in a way that is easy to attack and prove wrong, and asserted that
magic assertion of increased profits and ignorance of the mining equilibrium =&gt; profits =&gt; more players in the market =&gt; decentralization
You completely ignored that mining is an equilibrium system so more revenue doesn't mean more profit. You completely ignored that more players in the market doesn't mean one player can't have a large portion of the marketshare (centralization) and you completely ignored that with an economy of scale, most of those supposed higher profits will be going to the person at scale anyways.

Not really. It's fairly high for what Bitcoin can support right now. There is a lot of confusion around these numbers. Measurements of what the blocksize should be isn't based on what a very weak computer can handle, it is based on what **the Bitcoin network** can safely handle. Right now the median bandwidth between a miner and half the other miners is 723Kb/s.
If you want to have a centralized currency run from your computer, then you don't have all the constraints of decentralized consensus. I'll agree the transaction volume can be much higher in that case, because a currency is only constrained by what your computer can process. However, when we talk about a decentralized consensus based currency, we don't operate  on the requirements of a single node, we operate on the requirements of keeping the network running and maintaining its security assumptions, which include decentralization 


Because this is very dangerous and promotes weak consensus and centralization.

I've already explained that a large portion of a miners costs would be constant when reaching equilibrium (supporting cost is the cost of processing transactions), therefore equilibrium is reached where the miners have similar costs, but their revenues are proportional to hash share. Constant costs and revenues proportional market share leads to equilibrium where the largest miner is the only one profiting. I don't know what isn't understood. If you create a near-perfect economy of scale, you're going to end up with the largest company profiting and all others losing.

Gold does pretty well. Bitcoin will survive while scalability solutions are being developed. What Bitcoin can't afford is becoming centralized, because that completely removes the  value of Bitcoin.


I'm more concerned about ease of running a full nodes, which is correlated with full node count, but not the same thing. If Bitcoin becomes centralized in that sense then Bitcoin isn't trustless, and then what's the point? Why not just have GHash manage the currency, get rid of mining.


Right, it would just make running a full node easier and gradually make mining less centralized.


SPV clients have been out for a while, full nodes have been dropping steadily as the block size has increased. Also, if miners aren't running full nodes nor are the wallet owners then the only person who actually knows what's going into the blocks, is the large miner who can profitably run a full node because he is so big.

Heh, funny how a mining pool stole over 3000 bitcoins from a gambling website and then grew to be the largest mining pool. Seems reputation doesn't matter much when your users don't control their hardware.
Ohhh, that word you throw around when you don't actually have content.

The only difficulty in double spending is due to the security through obscurity. If Bitcoin wallets were locked through a captcha so bots couldn't steal Bitcoins I would want that removed as well. You know why? Because it's not a real form of security, it is just an inconvenience just like what Peter Todds patch fixes.

I never claimed it bought you something, but clearly you have decided that the benefit of running a node outweighs the cost. If I were to guess based on the reasons I run a node, you run a node for the benefit of having a hobby, or for the benefit of being able to analyze data on the blockchain, or to support Bitcoin for political reasons, or to support Bitcoin because you have stake in Bitcoin.
The benefit needn't be monetary for it to exist.

The limit isn't temporary, it's permenant with the current network. The current network needs to be abandoned if there is to be a new limit.


That is a reasonable concern, but the reality is that these core devs have been consistent with wanting a proper scaling mechanism for a while and that increasing the blocksize is dangerous. So they started a company to do exactly that.


Funny thing is, if you did that, rather than 4/5 of the developers with merge access being opposed to it, you would reduce the number by one to 3/4, it wouldn't be a massive change! Blockstream employees aren't the only ones opposing it, basically every core developer except Gavin opposes it.

That's true, but it isn't really relevant. If there is miner centralization Bitcoin is basically useless.

Any user leaving will decrease the fee demand and lower fees once again. There will be an equilibrium.


They already put up with unconfirmed transactions


They will use off-chain solutions if it becomes that costly.


Millions of (10M to be exact) users can use Bitcoin for settlement once per month. A few million users is a healthy number of users for a settlement system. I'm not sure what you mean by settlement currency though, the currency is just the unit of exchange, the settlement *system* is the blockchain. The regular method of payment cannot be the blockchain if you want millions of users.

Isolation attacks can be sybil, an attacker couldcould spawn 100000 nodes and try to get a peer to connect to only their nodes, or they could DoS all the seed nodes except for the one they have compromised, or something else. More nodes makes this a bit harder.

The previous post goes over this.


"Justus is working on the assumption that the network can be supported by transaction fees that are dependent on the cost of a transaction. In other words, transaction processing costs would be most of the cost of mining"
If the transaction fees are dependent on the cost of processing a transaction, then the revenue from mining is paying for running a full node, not securing the network, leading miners to spend proportionally less securing the network and proportionally more running a full node.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:54:02

Basically many developers who think Bitcoin should scale through means other than increasing the blocksize started a company to fund the building of other infrastructure to use for scaling.
So, a subset of developers are now paid to build infrastructure to solve the scalability problem and continue to think what they thought before the company was started, that the blocksize shouldn't increase.
People saying they are driven by their conflict of interest are looking at it backwards. I just looked at their team page and noticed that many people who have been opposed to a blocksize increase have been hired on i.e. Strateman. This makes sense since people who don't want a blocksize increase should want to work on scaling tools which are primarily being developed by Blockstream.
Of course, this company didn't hire everyone who finds objection in increasing the blocksize, there still is Wladmir, the lead developer (not Gavin) of Bitcoin Core.

You should be aware that almost all altcoins are scams. I'm not saying this because I only own Bitcoin, I'm saying this because it is the result of people being able to make lots of money by creating a cryptocurrency and pretending it can do something it cannot.
For example, proof of stake currencies depend on security through obscurity, so they are objectively worse than Bitcoin. 
There are cryptocurrencies that have different economic systems than Bitcoin (they are inflationary and have a constant monetary supply increase). I don't consider it to be a scam, but I do think it is a poor investment.
There are currencies that claim to be "anonymous". There is a notable scamcoin that does this that starts with "d" and ends with "ash", and I'd recommend avoiding it like the plague. It has rabid pumpers who love to promote it deceptive ways, however that's all it is, smoke and mirrors. No working security.
There is another "anonymous" cryptocurrency that has proper security fundamentals called Monero.
The only problem with buying currencies with some technological advancement is that if it a good enough advancement, it will make its way into Bitcoin. Bitcoin already has the network effect and I don't foresee a future where any altcoin is even close to Bitcoins market cap and popularity.

When the miners aren't auditing blocks there is no way of knowing that their pool was even the pool that attacked, let alone preventing the attack.


No, you are just postulating nonsense. When there's an economy of scale, the larger groups have more ability to grow.


Yes, we absolutely need to regulate miners, I'd rather regulate miners on my end than allow them to make Bitcoin trusty on their end.


Yeah, it doesn't prevent competition it just removes the reason for someone to compete.


The constant cost of entry barriers and knowledgeable employees contribute to economies of scale... I can't believe you just claimed that economies of scale don't exist in the modern economy.
You're dodging the issue, yes of course in literal terms an economy of scale doesn't prevent a mining startup just as walmarts economy of scale doesn't prevent small local businesses with much higher costs from competing, but realistically they can't survive competing with a larger business when there is an economy of scale.

"need" isn't really the right word. You do a cost/benefit analysis to determine whether you should run a full node. You can't increase the number of people who "need" to run a full node, but you can increase the number of people who decide to run full nodes by lowering costs.

It isn't false, you are just being a pedant. Miners can steal, or help steal your money (in exchange for part of the profit) depending on who paid you. If mining is centralized there is basically no point to Bitcoin since you need to trust the miner(s) to be honest.

Why are you saying slightly more centralization? There is a strong centralizing effect with full nodes being more expensive.
Also, how do you show that Bitcoin will stop functioning? Bitcoin continued to function when GHash had 51%, but GHash having 51% basically meant Bitcoin wasn't trustless for a while. The only thing useful about Bitcoin is trustlessness. If Bitcoin cannot maintain miner decentralization there isn't really a point to a blockchain.

Yes, you are right, elliptic curve crypto is vulnerable to quantum computers. We will need to softfork to upgrade to postquantum crypto when the time comes.

"Average transaction is confirmed in 358 blocks" doesn't make sense. Average transaction isn't a useful measure since you can create a very large number of zero fee transactions for zero cost that will never be processed. In fact, if we didn't have a min relay fee, then I would expect the average transaction to be confirmed in a few months or longer.
It seems that almost everything in that picture is an issue today, when we don't even have full blocks for the simple reason that seems to be missed by many: decentralization isn't free

Yes it is POS, in fact the name "DPOS" is just POS with an adjective describing further how it works. You could call peercoins POS "PPOS" and make the same non-argument. What matters is that proof of stake is defined, in the paper, as "proof-of-stake is the idea that we can use cryptographic proof, rather than physical arguments such as the Landauer limit, to demonstrate that some computation is costly." which applies to DPOS.

Centralization has nothing to do with the number of people who can use it. There are hundreds of millions of people using the centralized currency run by the US government.


Neilsons law is an observation, not a guaranteed trend. I'd prefer not to bet Bitcoin on an uncertain trend. There are other costs associated with a full node including processing power and storage. Larger blocks also have a centralizing effect due to higher latency. Not to mention the fact that a 1MB to 8MB increase in a few months DOESNT follow Neilsons law.


No, your client will just throw away spam transactions. It won't grow forever, it will just be as if you never broadcasted your transaction.. the same way it is now with low priority transactions.


It is better to have the option of an expensive TRUSTLESS blockchain, or the option of off chain transactions (which will be trustless as well if you use Lightning) than to have mandatory trust caused by centralization when using Bitcoin.


Yeah, I agree, if we increase the blocksize cap by a small amount, say to 1.1MB, then it probably won't kill Bitcoin, however an increase that allows blocks over an order of magnitude larger than the current average block size isn't small and is very dangerous especially considering the state of the mining ecosystem as it is now.

Bitcoin is often viewed by critics to be a "pump and dump" scheme rather than a Ponzi scheme. It is argued that Bitcoin users promote Bitcoin and make dubious claims about potential rewards, for example saying "Bitcoin is guaranteed to multiply in value by 100 in the next few years". These claims are untrue and Bitcoin has no such guarantee.
On the other hand gold, which is essentially a physical alternative to Bitcoin, has people promoting it and making claims about it's future value as well.
In the end, many commodities, currencies, metals, stocks, etc have people trying to "pump" their value by making dubious claims. You cannot define something as a pump and dump based on the actions of a few people using the currency.
What is important is to know that Bitcoin has no guarantee of increased price and you must analyze the risk of owning bitcoins.

Your units are wrong then. $100k/month means they are using $100k/month, not that they own $100k... for a month or whatever you're trying to convey with that. Payment hubs can almost be seen as a savings account. You earn fees for having money. If for some reason you don't like the interest rate you can turn off the payment hub.


Or they could just have however much money they have on hand and accept users based on that. It's like saying "you need $1M to invest in a company", no you don't, you just need $1M to buy 1000 shares of the company.


No, you just aren't understanding the difference between a cost and an investment. It doesn't cost me $1M to put $1M into a bank account. My estimate of $100/month isn't anywhere close because it's based on future possible adoption numbers. Immediately it will likely be smaller.


Miners all run nodes by definition, if they don't they are hashers. I explained this because you seemed to be confused about the very different failure modes of mining network centralization and LN centralization. Mining centralization is a failure mode arguably when any party can sustain somewhere between 51% and 25% or even less depending on your definition. Lightnings centralization failure mode is a DoS failure as in "oh golly gee whiz, my lightning hub is being naughty, I have to move to a different hub". Lightning basically isn't a failure unless you cannot find a single reliable node.


A network run by only a few nodes is probably a further off failure mode than miner centralization. I think there's a disconnect here, I'm not talking about centralization from full node count falling too low, that isn't a concern of mine because as long as one node I'm connected to is honest AND the miners are behaving, I am safe. What is a concern TODAY is miner centralization.


Yes, in your imaginary situation where the granularity of the network is for some reason in the millions of dollars for some strange reason, yes, the broken system you have described, which is not reflective of reality, is problematic. However anyone with 1000 bitcoins, 1 bitcoins, 0.01 bitcoins, will be able to run a lightning hub.

They have done a cost benefit analysis and determined that "reasonably secur"ing their customers coins benefits them more than the cost of a full node harms them.


Even services that can survive without a full node can benefit from running a full node, therefore it is a cost benefit analysis. If you "need" it for your service to survive, then the cost benefit analysis will show that you should run a full node. If you don't "need" it to survive, however it will increase your security and the long term profits of your company, then a cost/benefit analysis will still show that you should run a full node despite not "needing" to.

Good work, some suggestions:
I don't think any core devs qualify the block size remaining as-is "until fee pressure builds". Many want the block size to remain as-is until it can securely be increased.

Big blocks you probably should add "risk of mandatory centralization and trust"
There isn't a hardfork risk associated with big blocks, it is a hardfork guarantee.

In theory this is a weak claim since being wealthy doesn't increase the incentive to run a full node by a much (tragedy of the commons) and in practice we have seen that your claim is wrong and the full node count has declined as block sizes have increased.

Bitminter, Eclipse, Eligius, Give Me COINS, P2Pool and more. But you're asking the wrong question. It isn't a counting game, the option to reduce variance and run a full node is there. We just need for full nodes to be sufficiently cheap so a sufficient number of miners find it more beneficial to run a full node than costly in order to keep the network decentralized.


Your mining equipment doesn't come with a mandatory pool. The tools to run a full node, audit your blocks and keep mining trustless and decentralized are there. 


You're confusing terms here and I want to avoid you bringing up the confusion between variance reduction and running a full node again. Pool mining is just variance reduction, there is nothing wrong with running P2Pool or using Eligius with GBT. A majority of miners are forced to pool mine AND we can have decentralization with that fact given that they audit their own blocks.




So basically your logic is "users cannot leave their pool once they join it, therefore even if other pools have trustless mining options, they are only available to current pool members"? Complete nonsense.


They're both forms of centralization enhanced by an economy of scale partially caused by constant cost in running a full node.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:45:57
For a block size increase you need both nodes and miners. If you only have miners then the 1MB blocks win, if you only have nodes then the 1MB blocks win.
Even ignoring node adoption, the block size increase chain is at a significant disadvantage. Even if 51% of miners run the &gt;1MB block software, their  &gt;1MB blocks will stale 98% of the time.

Miners should be expected to act in self interest. They announced it clearly which is more benefit than they needed to give anyone. It should be assumed that miners already are accepting doublespends.
We don't need an announcement for every little change every individual miner makes, we should just do what has been advocated for years and not accept zero conf.
I repeat, THERE IS NO ZERO CONF SECURITY. A mining pool changing their policy OVERTLY is just them being nice, NEVER assume mining pools are acting in your economic interest. This same kind of reasoning led to a &gt;1000BTC theft by GHash.


This isn't a very good example of something  that is sprung on users by core devs. The fee market has been well announced and has existed for a long time.

Please read all of this before commenting.
The costs that are constant are the costs of running a full node. The cost of running mining equipment is roughly linear with revenues. Basically,
    profits = revenues - expenses
Your expenses are roughly hashing resources and full node resources.
    profits = hash revenues - (hash costs + full node costs)
 The more hashing resources you use, the more hashing revenues you find and the more hashing costs you expend, roughly linearly. For example, if I spend 10x as much on mining equipment and resources, I will earn 10 times as much in mining revenues. Let's call the mining profitability parameter K
    profits = [(hash costs)K - hash costs] - full nodes costs (constant cost)
Because mining is an equilibrium system and any time mining is profitable more resources will be spent on mining, larger players will see an advantage when there is a large constant cost. With small full node costs relative to hashing costs, this negative effect isn't very noticable, but as Justus was arguing, it's fine if the entire transaction fee is based on the cost of transaction processing (full node  costs).
While justus was arguing that it would be fine if all (100%) of the tx fee was based on transaction processing resource scarcity, lets just imagine that 10% of the costs for a 20% miner is full node processing.
    profits = [($90/unitoftime)*K - ($90/unitoftime)] - ($10/unitoftime)
For the 20% miner with only 10% of their expenses being full node costs, they have to earn $10 for every $9  they spend hashing to break even (K = 10/9).
Now, let's imagine they're competing with a 5% miner. Because full node costs are constant, the 5% miner is also spending $10/unitoftime on transaction processing, however they are spending 1/4 of what the 20% miner is spending on hashing and earning 1/4 the revenue hashing that the 20% miner is. $90 * 1/4 ~= $22.5
    profits = [($22.5/unitoftime)*K - ($22.5/unitoftime)] - ($10/unitoftime)
The 5% miner needs to have a mining profitability parameter, K, of 144%. In other words, a smaller miner needs to be much more profitable per unit of money spent on mining. For every dollar that goes into mining equipment, electricity, maintenance, etc, they need to make $1.44 to break even. Compare this to the 20% miner who only needs to earn $1.11 for every dollar they put in.
The 5% miner most likely cannot make up for full node costs, and cannot earn $1.44 for every dollar they put in. The 20% miner will be the most profitable miner and can grow slowly as their competition can't make the profits needed to stay in the business. 
This has been the hypothetical that 10% of miner costs are transaction processing, however Justus is working on the assumption that the network can be supported by transaction fees that are dependent on the cost of a transaction. In other words, transaction processing costs would be most of the cost of mining, which has an even larger economy of scale.
Now let's look at mining today. Running a full node costs maybe $5/month. A 10% miner can make about $2.5M in revenue per month. That means their break even point requires 0.0002% profit per hash. Now let's compare this to a 0.01% miner. They need about 0.2% profit per hash using this model. The difference between small miners and large is insignificant.
This model leaves out some factors such as labor and dis-economies of scale from heating, but when you have a massive constant cost, it drowns out those factors. The system is clearly broken when full node costs are any significant portion of costs, however if they are not significant and the system doesn't have obvious faults, the game theoretic model around mining becomes much more complex. If the model is, as it is now, not inherently broken by a large constant cost, things such as heating diseconomies of scale, labor, tragedy of the commons are worth considering.

Addresses are a lot like receipt paper. You could re-use receipt paper, but that's pretty inconvenient and pointless. It allows new customers to see the payment information (amount and time) of previous customers. It doesn't make sense to sum the payments on one receipt and call it "receipt balance", because your **actual** balance is the sum of what people have paid you. The fact that different people paid you on the same receipt doesn't have any relevance to your funds, what matters is the total spendable funds belonging to you, which is what a balance actually means.

I don't have to. It's talking about history. I'm talking about a proposed system that gravitates towards a monopoly. Seriously think about this. If running a full node costs $10k/day and there is a 10% miner and 90 1% miners they all will be paying $10k/day plus the cost of their mining equipment, but since the transaction fee is nearly the cost of the electricity from processing it, the 10% miner is going to make almost 10x as much revenue as the 1% miners, while they all have a $10k/day cost. 
So perhaps monopolies don't happen with naturally scarce things such as labor, metals, etc, but if you design a system in which there is an economy of scale that is near perfect, and 51% gives you the ability to guarantee a monopoly, you can be assured there will be centralization.

We don't know what future Nielsens law holds, let alone the future of upspeed vs downspeed.  If we assume without considering any evidence that Nielsens law will hold that it will, we must also determine an acceptable block size limit before we have it increase with the decrease of bandwidth costs (and other expenses). Given the mining ecosystem right now, 500KB is probably too high. Perhaps when the cost of bandwidth and other resources go down 500KB will be safe, and in 2 years 1MB will be safe assuming Nielsens law holds.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:43:19


I assume you mean exponential, and extrapolating on the past doesn't always work. It certainly isn't *very* safe to assume it will continue, it is just extrapolation based on the past. When you say "information technology" I assume you mean the hardware around information technology. A counterexample to this is Moore's law, which moore himself said would die off. We have seen clock speeds level off at the 3-5 gigahertz range.


As there always has been always will be. Your complaint seems to be about fees, but your phrasing makes it seem to be about something related to the client.


Bitcoin has never been able to sustain large scale microtransactions. Fundamentally the design of the blockchain prevents this. If you want microtransactions, your best bet is supporting trustless off-chain solutions like Lighning.


It's actually very plausible, look at the mining ecosystem today, it is dangerously centralized, the largest single miner can reverse a confirmation with near-50% success, the largest two can collude to reverse 6 transactions with greater than 50% success. In 2013 large blocks caused a miner to have approximately 50% of the network hashrate, the fix for this was a software optimization, but it was only temporary, blocks continued growing and we are once again in a dangerous place. The solution to the mining ecosystem being fixed is software optimizations and cheaper full nodes through hardware prices declining and block sizes not increasing. Here is a better description of the problem though 


Yes... that is the entire problem.


You should consider 8MB to be immediate if you're going to promote a software change that makes it possible. If 8MB is not safe the moment it is possible, an 8MB limit shouldn't be applied.


Which of these is the end result then?
* You will pay for all the miners new connections since it's so cheap
* You expect miners to pay the costs for new full nodes to your benefit of cheaper transactions
* You expect miners won't pay the additional costs and accept the centralizing effect


No, they are on the blockchain immediately like any other transaction. Yes, you need new software, just like any other upgrade? I'm not sure how new features requiring an update is even an argument against it, if a user doesn't want cheaper transactions they can run the old software... and it will work, which can't be said about Gavins hardfork change.

These 




are basically the same thing. 
Fully validating rather than SPV -&gt; more data and processing
Bigger blocks -&gt; more data and processing
more data and processing -&gt; Harder to run a node / Less convenience -&gt; Less nodes -&gt; More centralization


If full nodes required the only resources of SPV clients then there would be no reason to run SPV clients. Since blocks aren't size zero, full nodes are more costly to run and users are moving away from them. It isn't a step function with a single step where everyone migrates to SPV. It is intuitive that there is a wide range of costs that people are willing to run full nodes at. As you increase the cost there are less full nodes.

He's not arguing that fees will protect the networks security. He's arguing that fees paying for the cost of processing transactions, rather than fees paying for securing the network, are sufficient.


I don't like the way the word "free market" is thrown around as meaning "no rules given to participants". I can join a gym, but there is an "arbitrary" closing time rule that you must follow, I can pay for cable but there are "arbitrary" restrictions on the channels I can watch. An "arbitrary" quota is a property of the private currency "Bitcoin" that users currently accept upon when using the currency and running it's software. You are free to make another competing currency without a quota, however the free market will favor a currency that is trustless. As I have explained,  through the "free market" solution in Justus' model, you end up with the only largest miner profiting, leading to the loss of the trustless property. So yes, in this free market you can create a  trust-invoking currency that can handle all the worlds transactions, and no one is stopping you.

Requiring more processing power to be a fully validating node gravitates the system towards centralization and trust.
Bitcoin is more useful as a trustless system for 50,000 than a trust-invoking centralized system for 100 million. We already have plenty of centralized currencies.
This of course isn't to say that we can't scale beyond 50,000 people using Bitcoin, but it cannot be done through increasing the blocksize unless computational resources match the increase.
In other words, to optimize for usefulness of Bitcoin, we must maximize the number of Bitcoin users (and its network effect) while keeping it trustless, the point where we can support more than 100k transactions per day is dependent on the scaling tools we build. The first step to scaling by more than an order of magnitude is the Lightning network.
It is apparent that one side of the issue foresees the future where we have a useful trustless currency while the other sees that 100MB blocks means 300x the users ASAP and hear "cha-ching".

Right, and the want comes from the cost benefit analysis. If running a full node doesn't benefit you more than it costs you, you won't run one. If full nodes didn't require any extra resources, everyone would run full nodes because of the security and privacy benefit.
You are making it sound like the want to run a full node is black and white, however it varies with the cost. As you increase the cost, less people want to run full nodes.

Why are you saying slightly more centralization? There is a strong centralizing effect with full nodes being more expensive.
Also, how do you show that Bitcoin will stop functioning? Bitcoin continued to function when GHash had 51%, but GHash having 51% basically meant Bitcoin wasn't trustless for a while. The only thing useful about Bitcoin is trustlessness. If Bitcoin cannot maintain miner decentralization there isn't really a point to a blockchain.

@_date: 2015-12-31 11:48:02


I didn't claim that. It is however easily the strongest contributor.


Stake holders =/= miners. Increasing the number of stakeholders alone doesn't decentralize the network. You'll note that the USD has many more stake holders than BTC. If the payment network, which depends on miners isn't decentralized, then the currency isn't decentralized. Having more miners isn't decentralization.
A brief example: Currency A has 100 miners, all with 1% of the hashrate. Currency B has 1,000 miners, but one miner has 80% of the hashrate. Currency A is quite decentralized, but it has 1/10th the miners Currency B has, and Currency B is very centralized.

Your post goes over consensus, but doesn't really explain much about consensus (you touch on it in the first bullet but the rest is just explaining software and human behavior).

You mean actual tech startups like Greenaddress? Coinbase doesn't know what they're doing and has historically had pretty bad infrastructure, I don't count on them knowing how Bitcoin works or the implications of larger block sizes.
In the end, if Bitcoin isn't decentralized, it doesn't matter what the fees are.

If you use a meaningless definition for expensive you may be right, however this doesn't really contradict my statement, it just seems to distract from it so I don't know what else to say.


That already exists... but I'm not sure what you don't understand. Most of the cost associated with running a full node isn't the cost of typing a one line instruction, it's the cost of resources like disk space, bandwidth, memory, etc.

No, there have been a few altcoins whose founders have been pretending they are Bitcoin lately (some of the more deceptive scamcoins I've seen) that don't give a damn about the stakeholders and give all their power to the miners, however you are wrong to confuse them with Bitcoin.

That is just Hearn misunderstanding. The chronological proof is what's produced, there is NO way for miners to know which transactions were generated first without a proof. An attacking miner ignores a PROOF of the chronology, but they aren't attacking if they don't know which tx came first.

Not really an over simplification, your model clearly comes to equilibrium where costs are near-constant, while revenues are proportional to market share, which leads to only the largest player profiting, of course.


No, I've modeled mining where the economy of scale is near-perfect, and a constant cost being the vast majority of the cost between all competitors is obviously going to result in a majority player. If you have proper incentives the failure modes are much more complex and not well modeled, but if you design a broken system as you have, the failures are obvious.


Because there is no need to. Why do you feel the need to bring authority into this rather than working on facts and logic?
@_date: 2015-06-08 18:02:20




Yes it does, mining is less centralized if more miners run full nodes. More expensive full nodes cause less miners to run full nodes. Saying it has not one "fucking" thing to do with blocksize indicates that you haven't heard a single argument from the opposition.


That is a non sequiter, you running a full node has nothing to do with variance.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:35:31
Right, so it follows that you can increase the number of nodes by having people with lower benefit to run them by lowering the cost.

Everything that doesn't allow suppression of science makes altcoiners unhappy. For the past few months, altcoiners have been brigading this subreddit. In one thread, the suggested sorting was set to "controversial". Because this made brigading almost useless, the brigading subreddits became irate.
Essentially, the people unhappy with this subreddit mostly want a one sided discussion. If you go to the subreddits doing this brigading, you'll realize this. Almost all dissent is hidden and almost no responses to the dissent [go above the third level of the heirarchy of disagreement](
On this subreddit, we try to mitigate the effects of brigaders hiding constructive posts, and try to reduce the level of ad hominem attacks and other forms of noise. Hiding posts and creating noise are the strongest tactics of those unhappy with and of course not being able to use those tactics would make them unhappy.

This would still require the processing of every transaction by all the full nodes. It may be an improvement since full nodes wouldn't need a chainstate db, but it would be marginal.


If you do that then you need an archive node to provide the rest of the history if you want new network members to trustlessly enter the network. Also, this only solves the storage problem which isn't much of a problem at all compared to bandwidth.


This seems like additional complexity for little benefit. It makes paper wallet savings undesirable since you need to verify your money every so often. It also helps with the storage problem (which is far from being the biggest scalability problem) marginally.
We already have a solution for scalability that doesn't involve making the block size massive and having a central authority dictate: sidechains.

LN almost certainly won't have more hubs than Bitcoin will have full nodes in the short term (and most likely in the long term as well), though that isn't a problem.


Whoah, you are terribly misinformed, there is no reason a payment hub would cost $1M/month, unless you're talking about the far future where perhaps there are billions of transactions going through this hub per day, in which case it isn't much of a concern since their costs can be covered by fees.


It likely will be more centralized, but it doesn't have the same properties as Bitcoin. In Bitcoin a majority of miners can steal your money. Lighting doesn't have the same problem. I don't really even care if lightning hubs cost hundreds of dollars per month (which, once again, they shouldn't until there is MASSIVE adoption) since they can be directly incentivized by fees. 
Miners, on the other hand, only run a full node is to keep the network and their funds secure from centralization, that is their only incentive. So consider a 0.1% miner who has to ask "will I run a full node and decrease my profits by the cost of running a full node, or will I decrease network security and outsource block creation to some large central authority".
Now look at the mining ecosystem as it is today, the largest pool can reverse confirmed transactions with near 50% success. In 2013 we saw a pool hover around the 50% level due to centralizing effects caused by larger blocks, this threat was reduced due to a new protocol for faster block propagation, however as blocks have increased in size, the same threat is in the horizon and the only way to stop it is to keep the block size at a safe level and work on scaling techniques that don't harm the security of the system.


I don't mind waiting for scalability tools, it's better than breaking it fast and creating centralization.

Invalid transaction are irrelevant to this discussion. They are required to include all transaction if they want to help another full node achieve consensus and they need to download all these transaction if they want to achieve consensus themselves. It is silly to say "they can just not forward them" since that eliminates the purpose of them sharing any transactions at all with another full node.


No it doesn't, miners generally already have merged mining info in their coinbase transaction. More protocols wanting to store hashes means a linear increase in block size if they use OP_RETURN, but no increase in block size (constant) if they use merged mining info.
@_date: 2014-12-20 12:26:28
Yes, of course it would need a hardfork. Right now all nodes view 1.5mb blocks as invalid. If some nodes increased their limit and a 1.5mb block came along then the old nodes would reject it, the new nodes would accept it and they would be out of consensus.

It doesn't even have to be an attack, if it is trust based, you may just end up using a different currency than other people over time. You also may trivially be isolated and scammed, but ignoring that, the fact that the consensus depends on trusting a set of people then only realizing you and a merchant are on a different blockchain indicates a weak consensus.


Penalizing double signers is a joke. I explained that penalizing double signers depends on attackers releasing their second signature, or being **honest**. Your security assumption can't be expect attackers to be honest.


Not if you are out of consensus. If you are fed a forked of the blockchain everyone else is using then you are out of consensus. That is the long range attack. The short range attack is colluding delegates or censoring colluding delegates or sybil delegates or NaS on the stakeholders of before when the attack started or many of the other attacks made possible by NaS. The most critical of these attacks, I believe, is not accepting reorgs. If you won't accept a blockchain that is taller and says another set of delegates are correct then an attacker can attempt to time the release of this fork so half the network accepts one set of delegates and half the network accepts another, breaking consensus until a central authority/trusted party corrects it.


Unless there is some consensus breaking reorg prevention mechanism, you don't need to be a delegateto make a fork.


Oh, the reorg prevention, right. I will expand on reorgs a bit here. Lets say that that the blockchain won't reorg past 1000 blocks (I don't know the actual number). This means that if I create a fork at block 20000, I can release my fork including blocks 20000 to 21001 right as the main fork is releasing block 21001. I can do some research and time it so half the network accepts my fork and is permanently on my fork since the rest of the network won't accept it, or they are on the other fork. This is breaking consensus permanently.


If your checkpoints aren't centralized then you need some consensus mechanism so everyone has the same checkpoints. So you need to solve the consensus problem once more. Was DPoS not enough? If it was then the decentralized checkpoint shouldn't be necessary. It would be pointless to put DPoS on top of DPoS.

If the block size isn't large then Bitcoin could easily have the block size reach the block limit coming back to the original problem.


No, that was Gavins idea, not a roadmap. The **original** roadmap was to remove the 32 MB block size limit and that was done as a soft fork.

The nodes do push data around, they push coinbase transactions around which should contain a merkle root for every hash committed to the blockchain.
If 100 other protocols come along and commit data to the blockchain would Factom begin using them? Would there be a bunch of politics deciding who would be at the root? Would the be incompatibilities? There almost certainly wouldn't be only one OP_RETURN. There already is a field for committing hashes to the blockchain and having a 2nd means that it isn't the "only" transaction for data.

There is no reason for the blockchain to be used for these purposes. Based on your link I can see what kind of confusion is causing you to think Bitcoin is a good tool for these spammers. Being the person who is paying for the resources used by my full node it is rational for me to have my client not relay such spam.
From the link below:


This is false. It is a censorship resistant, but definitely not uncensorable, flooding network, but you could create similar topology between all of your bots.


This isn't spam and would be an actual value transferring transaction **if it was possible**. Because of the way botted computers work you can't trade botnets trustlessly. There is no way to prove you have given up control of the bots.

Depth is just a measure of the total height minus the transactions block height. You can have two blockchains and the taller one will be considered correct by the SPV client, as a side effect of having more height, the transaction will have more depth. Regardless, you aren't validating the blocks, just the block headers, this is SPV security.
If you want to actually understand what SPV security is without the risk of misinterpreting the wiki, read the original Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi.
When you trust the UTXO is valid based on more block height you have SPV security, I'm not sure why you think putting data in a block makes it full node security when you aren't checking how the rest of the data is formed.

This thread isn't about Gavins growth formula, it is about a formula that may lead to block size reaching 100MB in 4 months.
You keep bringing up this 50% growth formula as if it solves all problems though, it can lead to the same problem we are seeing today of transactions hitting the block size limit. This is why we need a solution that doesn't depend on hardware prices dropping to avoid centralization. Gavins solution only works in the case that Bitcoin grows 50% per year and we obviously haven't seen that.


As I explained in the last thread, you cannot prove that the UTXO set merkle root is valid without a proof (a bit of a tautology). If you can implement a proof that is more compact than the blockchain, go for it. SNARKs are being looked into for that.

A few of the things mentioned don't depend on an external state and don't require an oracle.
* [Gambling and weighted coin tosses can be done trustlessly]( I can bet anyone N bitcoins and have odds M of winning N/M bitcoins.
* Crowd funding can be done as well. You just need to pay to a transaction with an output valued at 1000BTC and your input of value 1BTC. Unless he gets the 999 other BTC the transaction isn't valid, since you can't have outputs worth more than the input sum in Bitcoin.
Lot's of people in this thread are saying Ethereum is the solution, when in fact most of the things you can do in Ethereum you can do in Bitcoin. Price feeds may be part of a sidechain, but you have to make sure the set of oracles are incentivized to not collude in both systems. One of these two systems have severe misalignment of incentives already (and it's not Bitcoin) so I'm not confident they will be the one to solve this.

On ethical grounds, he is forking unnecessarily. Hardforks are a form of centralization and they should only be done when necessary.


No? The person who created Bitcoin, first of all wasn't Gavin, and second of the person who created Bitcoin defined the block size as 1MB.


I didn't select an arbitrary size, the creator selected a size that was reasonable for an average computer to handle. Changing that size is a form of centralization, unnecessary and hurts scalability. You can change the size to 10 MB and you might be able to have a decent number of full nodes, but eventually that limit will be reached too. What will you do then?

Here is a [good argument for what's broken about PoS](
DPoS has made block winners deterministic, so while you can't "grind" (see paper linked) between each block, you can do some grinding to determine the ordering of the delegates making colluding possible. To prevent this original form of grinding, the security model was changed so sybil was a problem. Long range "nothing at stake" attacks are possible because you can buy many old delegate or old stakeholder keys. If you have done this once you can break consensus forever (unless of course there is some central authority).
The paper I linked explains why not expending an external resource means you aren't able to attain trustless decentralized consensus.

I think you missed a page. It explains why ASIC-resistant PoW are bad for centralization. Also, the load on full noads isn't nearly as bad as on thin clients since most of a thin clients work is validating block headers.


Indeed. The paper does explain that ASICs do have desirable properties as well though.


Some data regarding Litecoin is that their thin clients require 10 times the computation power to operate. This is just a stat I heard from someone who tested it and I'm not sure if they've published it. Ethereums PoW seems it would be least an order of magnitude more difficult to validate than scrypt though.


A lack of ASICs brings on botnets. Requiring a complex ASIC means the startup costs are higher. If the startup costs are high then an ASIC manufacturer will have a longer monopoly.


A great quote: "cryptocurrencies don't exist for miners, miners exist for cryptocurrencies".


I'm not sure why users would prefer it. If 10 confirmations regularly disappear then the consensus and security isn't very strong. I don't think many users are "happier screwing themselves over, it's fine to let them, since in the end it just doesn't matter much." They are probably just misguided by Vitalek into thinking his implementation is a good idea.


You are incredibly humble and open minded.


One bug in one implementation means that everyone recognizes that bug as being part of the specification. The link I gave shows a bug where in the reference Bitcoin implementation [had a small bug and while users using the reference client were unaffected, users using these alternative implementations broke consensus](


What I mean by "breaking consensus" is that not everyone running a client is in consensus. Of course not every client will be out of consensus with every other client, but every client using implementation A will be essentially using a different currency than every client using implementation B.


I'm not against multiple implementations, but all the implementations should evaluate the same way for consensus code. Having multiple consensus implementations leads to no consensus at all. The Bitcoin devs are currently making a library that other clients can plug in and evaluate blocks with. This means multiple implementations of clients sharing one consensus code.

The limit doesn't matter as much as a high number of transactions per second there are (which a high limit allows). With a high number of transactions per second most people can't run a full node.

Obviously you will run into the same problem you are arguing we need to solve if Bitcoin grows faster than that rate. Also, you cannot be guaranteed keep pace with CPU/bandwidth costs without a permanent central authority.


You would probably know better than me, but since you're asking I would guess your misinformation comes from a lack of understanding the alternatives (not understanding that sidechains are softforks, etc) and a lack of thinking it through (thinking a deterministic increase in block size can both be guaranteed to fit everyones transactions as Bitcoin grows and be guaranteed to scale with bandwidth prices).

Both of those problems are software-not-existing issues. Miners don't need to run the software behind factom, just accept arbitrary merged mining info.

I can't prove a negative. I can't address issues that don't exist. I have tried addressing your concerns. All you need is miners using compatible software and nodes connected to these miners. Since you already have a set of temporary central authorities, you aren't giving up much by requiring them to be connected to these miners.


I'm not concerned with miners blocking Factom, I'm just saying with either implementation option miners may be blocking you (however with merged mining info you are much more likely to have 100% of pools since there are pools that block OP_RETURN because of ethical problems).

@_date: 2014-12-20 14:58:22


It wasn't an analogy, it was a direct application of your definition.


My web browser is open source and Reddit is open source. I can review both of their sources. Reddit is still a central authority by pretty much everyones definition. When you use hardfork code, you are relying on a central authority to come into consensus with everyone initially.
You can qualify your definition of decentralized more and more until it applies to Gavin writing hardfork code that isolates you from everyone not running his update, but doesn't apply to anything most people consider centralized. This is a pointless practice though since it is just semantics. There is the definition you are using and then the definition almost everyone else it using. Sorry, but I won't be entertaining your semantic debate anymore in this post or any future posts, but I will discuss the implications of the update.


I don't think it is necessary or even desirable. Bitcoin needs to scale to global usage and having every full node have a copy of every transaction that happens anywhere ever isn't the way to do that. 


Please educate yourself. Sidechains don't require a hardfork nor do they scale as poorly as simply changing the block size.


That is a lie. I have plenty of reasoning including
* Risk of breaking consensus for an extended time period and damaging Bitcoin.
* Severe increase in difficulty of running a full node.
* Eventual severe reduction in the number of full nodes.
* Low number of full nodes making centralization higher and attacks on SPV nodes (basically everyone at that point) easier.
* Difficulty auditing miners due to a low number of full nodes and network security dropping.
* Lack of necessity due to alternatives being much more viability and the above problems not applying to them.

No, logic was used to determine that, but you can use ad hominem if it makes you feel better about not understanding the use cases of the blockchain. There is "no reason" to use the blockchain for things like voting, data storage and messaging in the same sense that there is no reason to build your home out of cloud servers. Cloud servers have their use case, and despite being a buzzword they aren't useful for everything imaginable, just as the blockchain isn't useful for everything imaginable. I determined that there is no reason to build a home using servers based on reasoning and logic.


This question is too ambiguous to come up with a reasonable answer. In what sense can you use the blockchain like it is without equal?


It is. The blockchain isn't effected by these changes, please understand what the changes do before commenting on them. I am not against the internets openness either even though my mail server has a spam blocker.

This is false. SPV clients include block headers to the current height.


Both SPV clients and full nodes check for the number of confirmations, SPV clients just accept incorrectly formed blocks as confirmations.
I'm not sure you fully understand SPV security. SPV clients don't lower resourced by not checking previous blocks (not knowing the block height), they lower resources by not checking anything except block headers. SPV is to block header verification as full node is to block verification.

It's a matter of writing code for for open source pooling software to accept it, so slightly inconvenient.


The term for someone validating transactions is a miner. Everyone else is a hasher. If you are using stratum or getwork and not running a pool server (like you would be with p2pool) you are a hasher. If you run p2pool or get block template you are a miner. You can see the pools with getblocktemplate here:

Because it expends no external resource it is vulnerable to NaS as the paper describes. I'm sure the same people who created the broken Bitshares security model are the people telling you "Nothing-at-stake has been shown to not be valid against DPOS". Anyone who says that clearly doesn't understand what NaS is on a fundamental basis.


The majority of Bitcoiners support Namecoin because it has sensible security assumptions and fills a purpose.

Pruning gets rid of transactions that cannot be redeemed. Transactions that cannot be redeemed includes OP_RETURN transactions and already-redeemed transactions.
Satoshidice and some others on the spam list create "dust" transactions, transactions that aren't worth redeeming since the fee would eat up their value. These transactions are sent to say "hey, you lost". They are sending a piece of data that will be on all of the thousands of full nodes harddrives, basically forever, to say "you lost".
The reason I run a full node is to support the Bitcoin network, not so someone can send a message and waste my resources. This update makes it so I don't waste my resources relaying this message to the dozens of nodes I'm connected to.

No, I can store a whole MB in a transaction after the OP_RETURN. You are confusing what is valid in a transaction and in the original design with what is STANDARD. The 40 byte field was made standard (relayed by the reference client) because people were abusing Bitcoin in a worse way.
OP_RETURN just immediately returns false in the script which means it can't ever be redeemed. Because it can't be redeemed, it can be pruned which is why it causes the least damage for data storage.
The core devs logic when making the 40 byte field standard wasn't "wow, we can let people store their data in the blockchain easily now! :DDDDD", it was "well shit, people are abusing bitcoin, lets try to make it slightly less harmful when they abuse it".

My disk space and bandwidth are being used for Bitcoin. When I run Bitcoin I am doing so to support Bitcoin and have full node security. When someone **forces** me to store data for them, I am not supporting the Bitcoin network. They are just forcing me to store data for them in order to reach my original goal of supporting Bitcoin.


Spamming dust as a method to send a message harms Bitcoin. The majority of the UTXO is this spam and it hurts Bitcoins scalability.


That would be a pretty expensive botnet and the blockchain is a very stupid usecase for that.  I would not want to block transactions that are for illegal purposes, but I would want to block transactions that aren't Bitcoin transactions, but spam.

1) The number of coins mined by Satoshi is probably overestimated. He wasn't the only person mining in 2009.
2) It is probably overestimated the number of held by satoshi. Among the coins mined by him, many if not all were probably deleted. If he wanted to be rich and he had his coins it would have been smart to cash out at least some of them by now.
3) Even if he has 500k bitcoins, that isn't something to be terrified of. Miners generate that in a little over 4 months right now. It would be quite the increase to the monetary supply, but as evidenced by Bitcoins current inflation, 2.5% inflation in a short time period isn't catastrophic.

It isn't a disadvantage if you have nothing to lose since you are no longer a delegate, or you have nothing to lose since you are no longer a stakeholder. Or someone knows the ordering and bribes you to create a small fork, this is a very shortrange attack and a 6 block reorg depends on 6% of the delegates colluding.
Other PoS implementations have different NaS attack vectors (such as some forms of grinding) because DPoS changed the security model a bit in the same sense that Peercoin doesn't have some NaS attack vectors because it changed to a centralized model. Bitshares is a federated trust model, but since those you trust are elected using stake, the consensus does have many of the same NaS vulnerabilities. You have now, however, introduced vulnerabilities within the federated trust model. You now have to both prevent NaS attacks (which can't be done with some reorg prevention without allowing for consensus splitting attacks) and prevent colluding authorities in your federated trust consensus model.
In terms of long range attacks, you appear to be okay with trusting others in order to achieve consensus. If those you trust are misled by an attack as well, you will end up on a different network than everyone else. This is a very weak consensus.
In terms of short range attacks, the ordering of delegates can be ground and this allows you to create a fork of size N where N is the number of colluding delegates total. 


NaS is just the general problem that making forks is costless. It isn't necessary to qualify it as long range or short range.


I explained that checkpoints require consensus, otherwise conflicting checkpoints will split the consensus... so you're planning on having a consensus mechanism within your consensus mechanism? Short range attacks aren't limited to a majority of the current elected delegates.


I suppose if I called it a scamcoin just because there were shills/pumpers like then I would have to call Bitcoin a scamcoin. Along with that, being broken I guess doesn't directly make it a scam unless the creators/shills know their model is broken.


I would like to see Bitshares formalize their security model and address all attack vectors in a way that uses proper terminology (for example not vaguely saying "decentralized checkpoints") and if it requires trust that you are on the correct fork directly state as much. So far the whitepaper I have read is vague enough that you can say "but we made this change..." to any criticism which can be met with "but that breaks this security assumption...".
Specifically Bitshares needs to cover how it avoids NaS (and the answer isn't "we put a 'D' in front of 'PoS' so it isn't PoS and NaS doesn't apply"), how it achieves consensus, if at all (can it be considered a consensus system if you can't decide which fork is the correct one without trust?), how it maintains consensus and different attack vectors delegates can perform to both break consensus and doublespend.

It should be obvious without even reading that that an average person can't sustain 250mb/s of transactions in terms of bandwidth, processing power or disk space.

That is the goal of full node validation, to verify that all blocks follow the rules and to construct the UTXO from that. I'm not sure what you're on about. Is knowing that the blockchain is formed according to the rules you state a bad thing?


That isn't the goal of full node validation, you don't need to know of spent transactions once you have the UTXO.


No, once again, the longest chain isn't a proof that the blocks are valid. Chain length isn't the only rule determining which blockchain is the correct one. If a miner created a few invalid blocks with an incorrect UTXO they could trick you. You are basically saying "that's okay, we don't need these people auditing anyways, everyone move to thin client security" as a response to the problem of a shrinking number of full node block auditors that would happen with your plan.

That analysis has a few flaws pointed out by the thread linked in it:
[There is this image in the thread]( of the blocks mined per day while diff=1. There seems to be quite a bit of variance. About 3/5 of the way through there is a 5 day period where blocks hangs around 10-20/day. It was also 10/day when it was first released. Because of the law of large numbers, I don't think variance alone can account for this. Either Satoshis hashrate changed drastically over time or there were many miners during the period. If Satoshi did only have the hashing power to make 15 blocks/day on average then he made about 300,000 bitcoins during the diff=1 period. Quite a bit, but only 1/3 of his estimate. Regardless, some set of people mined these 1.6 million bitcoins, I just doubt satoshi is a majority.


Even if the analysis is right, we don't know for sure he controls them, rather, he *mined* them.

To run a full node and to allow others to run a full node you can't refuse to include transactions, otherwise that block can't be verified.


While you are giving them data that they didn't consent to, you are disregarding their electricity bill and disk space that they burn in order to perform the original task that would be slightly easier without antisocial entities.

I'm not sure what you mean when you say validating it in the block header. The block header is a piece of data, not an operation. If you mean creating a SNARK are just validating that, then it is a space improvement. Otherwise "validating" is a process and doesn't make sense to say "validating it in the block header".
Consider how you would know whether a UTXO set is valid between one block and another. You would have to know what the UTXO actually contained (unless you had a ZKP) which can't be done just by having the hash of a block.
@_date: 2014-12-21 16:42:51


Yeah, 50% at most is what I meant.
I'm glad you can agree that transaction growth rate can only be &lt;=50%. So do you think this will be the case? Or do you think this solution will lead to the block limit being reached? Those are the only two options.


The softfork isn't the problem. Having the UTXO hashed isn't a proof, you need a proof so you know the UTXO is valid, otherwise you only have SPV security. I don't think a softfork is a problem at all, the problem is that you keep saying we should have the UTXO hash in the block header when you don't know the UTXO is valid without a proof. I mentioned SNARKs because they are a compact way to prove this.

Sidechains can scale that up by the amount we reduce redundancy by **without a hardfork**.


Just keep the headers. A very modest amount of data, ~500MiB in a hundred years.
Unless you validate the UTXO set each time then you only have SPV security. Validating the UTXO each time requires having the previous UTXO and applying the modifications to it the new block did.

Basically this change isn't necessary let alone ideal. Ignoring the central authority semantics, this change makes Bitcoin more centralized in the long term with less full nodes, and in the short term the network is at severe risk of failure since people are choosing between one persons implementation and the rest of the networks implementation basically making two currencies for some time period that people have to choose between.

That is invoking trust. If you invoke trust in the wrong set of people then you are permanently isolated.


You can add peers with Bitcoin as well. With Bitcoin you need to have one honest person give you information. With Bitshares, you need to choose a set of people to trust and if they're wrong you are wrong and have no way of knowing (since you are inherently distrusting people who disagree with them by design of the system).


You are implying the only people who can make forks are current delegates AND that the benefit of an attack can't outweigh the costs. 


Well... that's a wrong assumption. You aren't understanding how blocks are created. Unlike Bitshares where you know exactly who will make a block and can coordinate a collusion between 6 entities or 6% of the network, Bitcoin has no guarantee of making a block in a certain order. Assuming the largest entity that could force a large reorg has 10% of the network hashrate, they would only succeed [0.024% of the time]( costing them (6 blocks)*(25 BTC/block)*($318/BTC) * (~4100 tries) = $195,570,000. Yes, there are mining pools that have more than 10%, but their miners software will change pools if they detect a reorg attempt.


And when you aren't a delegate, the income you would generate from behaving honestly is $0. The rest of your post seems to be based around the lack of understanding of the NaS problem and the assumption that the only people who can create forks are current delegates or current stakeholders. Because of the way a blockchain works, time is subjective and can be forged. A fork using historical delegate private keys or historical stake can be made and unless there is some **centralized** checkpointing mechanism, or some consensus breaking mechanism (like not accepting reorgs) then this fork will be recognized as valid by the network.

There are many reasons people disagree. Many have alluded to satoshi and think full nodes should be run by large data centers.


Pools controlling pooled mining isn't really a problem. Pools not having their blocks audited and controlling the content of the blocks for their blind hashers is a problem. That is why running a full node needs to be easy for the miner.


20MB blocks are significantly worse. It makes it so a miner can't passively run a full node and the power is delegated to the pools.


Then the cost is in the hand of individual miners. The difficulty of running a full node increasing has a centralizing effect. If a pool can't manage to run a full node, the individual nodes sure as hell wont. GBT is less useful if miners don't want to audit blocks due to the large block size.


Pool size doesn't matter if their miners control block creation. Making the block size larger makes more miners delegate the responsibility of block creation to the pools. In other words, it causes centralization.
In general the economy of scale increases centralization.

The advantage of Bitcoin over every other currency is the lack of a *requirement* to trust anyone else. If Bitcoin becomes too centralized we have to trust that authority, and if you're trusting a central authority you might as well use a much more efficient system.


I would disagree. We don't have a massive 51% GHash anymore, however the top pool can reverse a block 50% of the time and the top two miners colluding can reverse six blocks 1/3 of the time. We are trusting to some extent that this pool (or these pools) won't try to (collude to) harm Bitcoin. 
The question of how much decentralization is necessary is interesting. I consider my Bitcoins to be "safe" if it takes large number of miners (or pools) to collude. Ideally every miner would run a full node and thousands of  miners would need to collude to attack.
Realistically we must optimize for other things as well, like usability. To get every miner to run a full node we would both need to make setting up GBT or P2Pool easy AND the resources used to run a full node would have to be small, perhaps we would need a 0.05MB block limit to fit my "safe" definition. This leaves us with somewhat of a usability constraint and miners probably wouldn't agree to a softfork to that level. To get to the level of decentralization that I consider "safe", we would need dozens (perhaps more) of miners to collude to attack the network profitably (be in the 20%+ range).
Our current 0.3MB blocks makes me worried, but as technology and the Bitcoin software advances I believe running a full node processing 0.3MB blocks should become easier and we will become safer. 
In short, we aren't safe today, we should work on making 1MB safe before increasing the block size.

[Here are formalized arguments against ASIC-hard PoWs](


The benefit of low block intervals is basically mute. When you have 10 second block intervals the odds of reorg skyrockets and to what benefit? It certainly isn't the benefit of having 1 conf security faster. The cost of attacking and reorging out 1 conf in Bitcoin will be orders of magnitude higher because one 10 second confirmation is **not** the same security as one 10 minute confirmation. Security isn't based on the number of confirmations rather the work that goes into that confirmation.  Along with that, natural reorgs without an attacker exist too. With Bitcoin about 1.8% of blocks are reorged out. The number of reorgs is inversely proportional to block time, so shrinking the block-time 60 fold make reorgs rampant and your consensus not very strong. As I mentioned, you need more resources to run a full node and MUCH MUCH more resources to run a lite note with Ethereums design. 


Because **consensus** requires code to be evaluated the same between all platforms. One little bug in any of the three clients causes consensus failure. This is his most glaring mistake, there is basically no justification for this other than not understanding the ins and outs of consensus. The link I gave you in the parent post should have been sufficient to allow you to understand "How on earth [i could] claim different implementations is bad for distributed consensus".


I'm not claiming it effects consensus, I'm just saying that the Ethereum team is advertising an addon for their consensus system that doesn't require consensus. They have a hammer and everything looks like a nail to them.


You didn't understand. Voting **DOESN'T REQUIRE CONSENSUS**. I'm not critiquing their implementation of voting in their consensus system, rather, I'm critiquing the fact that they want a voting tool on top of their consensus mechanism.


Hopefully this should suffice. I just assumed those who would be arguing about cryptocurrency theory would have some basic background in it.


Yeah, that's why I used "why" and not "how". As a limited example, he clearly understands how you hash a block over and over again while changing the nonce in order to find a partial collision and win a block. He just doesn't understand **why** it's done on a fundamental level.

"20MB is great because we can process 140tx/s"
"don't worry about the risks of 20MB though because we will probably actually only be supporting 5MB blocks"
If 20MB is unideal now, the answer isn't to say "well we probably won't hit 20MB anyways, but imagine the greatness that would be if we did (but ignore the risks)". The answer is to choose a number that is safe today.

No, antisocial isn't something that I disagree with. In the context of Bitcoin it is something that disregards the full nodes and forces something upon them.


Miners have no obligation to include transactions they disagree with for ethical reasons.


Not sure what you mean here. Either way you are including a hash in a block, it should be equally easy to "catch up" (whatever you mean by that) with either method.


I don't see the relevance of this either. Either way you are including a hash, since this merkle tree isn't kept by full nodes (only the root of the merged mining info is) Factom will have to maintain these.

If 15% of miners refused to recognize the softfork, the rest of the miners could decide that 85% is a sufficient threshold (0.25% chance of forcing a 6 block reorg per fork).

Large mining pools and farms also have an incentive to make blocks 20MB because it makes it harder for an individual to run a full node and compete with them. 20MB blocks are somewhat of a tool for large pools to increase their profitability with the side effect of also increasing centralization.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:30:18
Mining pool profitability isn't the miners profitability. A better term would be "proportional revenue" since the costs aren't accounted for, just the ratio of hashrate to revenue. Mining is a very low margin business, 0.3% of revenue may be 50% of profits for some.
Also, it is misleading to say pools vary from 60-110% profit regardless. The purpose of a pool is to reduce variance. Smaller miners and smaller pools have more variance. In fact, the pool at 60% found the least blocks of all the miners and the pool at 140% found the 2nd least. As the number of blocks found increases, the variance reduces.

@_date: 2015-05-07 16:53:01


No, those are all things I've heard over the past few days.


This isn't part of an explanation of how a higher blocksize cap means more centralization. A comprehensive explanation of how it becomes centralized doesn't need to take into account the implications of it being centralized, just  THAT it becomes centralized. I am not saying such an analysis shouldn't be done, I am just saying an analysis lacking an economic or price analysis may still be comprehensive if it gives you an explanation of the centralization risk.


The price of Bitcoin doesn't really translate to how much you are willing to invest in a full node. A full node today may be $5/month for a user. Whether a Bitcoin is $1000 or $100, the cost of a full node is relatively constant.
What we are seeing today is a rapid decline in the number of full nodes. For a while we have been growing in users, which should positively effect full node count, however we see full node count dropping as block size is increasing.


Not sure why you need a count. The block size expansion should be made safe THEN we should increase the block size, not the other way around.


Well it isn't now since it doesn't really effect the network. Once it does prevent the blocksize from growing it will be helping with decentralization.


Coders do focus on code, but those on the mailing list are for the most part not only coders, but researchers, but regardless of their title (researcher, coder), the centralizing effect of a more expensive node is very clear.

There is absolutely no reason a website would need to do something that can be integrated into the software. In fact Bitcoin Core already has floating fees.
If you come up with dumb strawman solutions then it's going to be easy for you to attack those solutions. 


They wouldn't need to know the exact fee, just the fee they need to pay to have a "good enough" probability (as defined by them) of having their transaction confirmed in a reasonable time. Just as it is today.


If you assume that a sudden increase is an idiotic solution then you shouldn't assume it is the solution used. Once again, it is easy to make strawman solution to problems, and easy to attack them.
We don't need to suddenly increase the block size, it can be gradual. However, even if we suddenly increased the block size (which I don't believe is the optimal solution), we would probably just end up where we are today with regard to fees, assuming we have a block subsidy that isn't near-zero.


If you don't expect miners to accept an addition change in supply then a block size increase is hopeless regardless.


2 is inaccurate. It isn't "slightly more expensive", it is "over an order of magnitude more expensive". There are probably others, but increasing the cost of running a full node is a big one since it has a big centralizing effect.


One of the consequences is a centralization risk, which reduces or destroys the only thing Bitcoin will always have over other currencies: trustlessness.


Paying fees shouldn't scare off users more than a useless Bitcoin.

Yes it is a situation that can get worse, that is your fundamental understanding. Less miners auditing their blocks means the network is more vulnerable to attackers. Miners SHOULD audit their blocks and many do. Invoking trust isn't the answer.


People use blocks because they are a datastructure used in Bitcoin. That doesn't make any sense.


You are comparing the cost to the total cost, not the total profit. If my profit margin is 1% and running a pool is 0.1% of my costs, it isn't a negligible 0.1%, it is 10% of my profit lost. Larger pools will have it as 0.01% of the cost and 1% of the profit. This is the economy of scale that is dangerous. They can pay miners more since they have a larger profit.
@_date: 2015-05-05 10:57:23
Yes, you can perform 8000 with a hyperoptomized Bitcoin client on a $400 processor using all the cores. You can also run a 1GB/minute full node on a supercomputer, but the goal isn't simply for miners to be able to run a full node. The important thing is making a full node not resource intensive. If you have to go out of your way or spend additional money to run a full node, miners are less likely to audit their blocks.
Running a full node must be to a miners advantage and many are already using centralized services instead indicating that at even 0.5MB/block it isn't fantastic. 1MB/block is high, but probably not devastating and more than that is entering into a dangerous area.

Blocks taking longer to confirm isn't a concern with 51% attacks. Miners censoring transactions makes Bitcoin worthless. Customers being able to collude with miners and reverse your payment removes the trustlessness of Bitcoin. Miners being able to doublespend their own tx is a risk. Miners can censor everyone elses blocks making them the only profitable miners (for the time Bitcoin has any value). A sustained 51% attack is bad with or without sidechains.

Well you are probably ignoring the reality of mining. Running a full node has become inconvenient. 20MB blocks would make it difficult. A full node is  a constant cost in mining and the larger it is, the larger the economy of scale is. This means pools with more hashers mining for them can pay a larger reward praportionally, farms can have a higher profit with more mining rigs and individual miners have less of an incentive to audit their own blocks rather than outsourcing the process.
Right now the largest pool can reverse a block with 45% probability. If they were to collude with the 2nd largest miner, they could reverse six blocks with 33% probability. We just saw GHash grow to 51% levels. Mining is NOT healthy and it is unhealthy because auditing a pools blocks is not easy.
@_date: 2015-05-06 04:33:30


I've addressed this. It is wrong, plain and simple.


I've articulated this plenty, you just fail with the logic of "Bitcoin is already broken, I don't see why not to make it more broken" rather than "Bitcoin is broken, lets fix it".
Your logic is insane, I recommend evaluating the incentive to run a full node and the consequences of a miner not running a full node and the consequences of pools being more profitable if they have more hashrate. I will not be responding unless you con come up with something meaningful that indicates you have considered this.

Yes, you can hardfork to add open bazaar. You can also hardfork to make Bitcoin a cat photo sharing service. Every full node can store the gigabytes of cat image macros that people upload every day. The catchain will allow us to have consensus on cat image macros.

I wouldn't own 30k in bitcoin in the state it is in right now. Having the right setup includes a multisig tx and many encrypted redundant private keys in places where they won't be destroyed. This is pretty difficult and learning about proper procedures to hold over 30k in bitcoin (I assume you mean 30k btc and not $30k in btc) requires spending probably 10btc in time and resources (~$4k for a safe, time burying private keys, etc), since you want to be extra cautious.
You are trying to simultaneously prevent loss through theft and through losing access to the bitcoins. If you encrypt the private key, you may forget it and lose access. If you don't encrypt the private keys, someone may find all your private keys and unlock the multisig. There needs to be steps done to make this easier.
If you are just speculating on Bitcoins value, you could use an ETF (that hopefully is soon-to-exist) and call the insurance company if you lose 30k btc.
What you may also want to ask yourself who you call when your bank fails and you have $12million in it (30k btc equivalent). You can get your $250k back from the FDIC, but what about the rest?
Certainly holding it in Bitcoin is more risky *now*. The future is another story.

There is no requirement to keep transactions in the mempool to keep consensus. In fact, transactions with too-low fees are already discarded, the same will happen when we have near-1MB blocks.
One the other side, you must download and validate blocks of any size if you want to maintain consensus. This is somewhat of a DOS vector, but isn't a terrible one if the block limit is relatively low.
Your attack is vague and I have no idea whether you are even talking stalling nodes (which I just addressed) or preventing transactions, but in the case of preventing transactions, that isn't really feasible either. It's like arguing that someone could DOS the silicon market by buying all new mined silicon. Sure, they could raise the price, but that only works if they can manage to outcompete everyone. If an attacker dedicates ten million dollars to the attack per month, they can only raise the cost of a transaction to 20 cents. This isn't really cost effective, you can do much worse things with $10M.


This is completely ignoring market forces. There isn't some rule stating that fees have to be a certain price. If the price of some commodity is $1/unit and there are 1,000,000 units, me buying 1,000,000 units for $1.01 won't force everyone out, the price will just rise, what you're suggesting isn't how supply and demand works.

My point has always been that an expensive full node removes the incentive for an owner of hashing power to run a full node, meaning they give their hashing power to another individual.

That figure was based on calculation error. Also, I never said 20MB was unfeasible, I said it was difficult/costly to do so.

You are playing word games now. All hashers rely on the pool by definition, but not all miners in pools are hashers. Many audit their blocks.


You can use a pool without being served work by them. This allows you to audit your blocks. Pools exist for variance reduction.


I never claimed that pools would switch to light clients, however it already has happened in some cases. The problem is a large portion of hashrate will be controlled by a single miner/pool because the miners don't want to run heavy full nodes.

Satoshi is only a human and he can be (and has been) wrong before. Analysis is the best way to come to an objective conclusion about what the implications of increasing the block size are and from those implications the decision can be made subjectively.

Given the small margins in mining, a 0.3% decrease in revenue can be very costly, even moving many miners to negative profit.
You also didn't consider the cost of running a full node. A miner being able to cheaply run a full node is critical to Bitcoin security. At the same time, a miner can avoid *all* costs associated with running a full node for free by outsourcing block generation.
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:03:22


I'm not sure I understand the question. You want to decrease your stales, but if the system changes in a way that you have an increase in stales, but not an increase greater than the average miner experiences, that is beneficial to you. If you are a large miner you will experience this benefit from larger propagation times and larger stale rates in general.
The cost of a full node increasing causes block creating organizations (usually pools) to grow. This is another centralizing effect.


I'm not sure where you're coming from here. If a node exists, you should expect it to propagate blocks for you. The number of nodes may decrease, but I don't see that negatively effecting propagation time, just security.

No one being able to use a trustless currency is the effect of a failed 20MB change. If you reduce the number of full nodes then more trust is in the hands of a few people.
With 1MB blocks you will need to use the lightning network, or some other solution.
The risk of 20MB blocks is greater because a functioning Bitcoin is better than a non-functioning Bitcoin.

*High-hashpower* block creators have an incentive to increase the block size limit because it gives them these advantages.


You accept transaction fees in exchange for the high risk. If we are filling large blocks, the fees should be sufficient to pay for the risk, the smaller miners will have more risk and require higher fees and be able to accept less fees and make less profit. It is all about tradeoffs in the risk, but the smaller miners are limited by their risk and their profit is affected.








each additional participant added




Your list doesn't make sense to me. The most profitable thing you can do is probably increase your share while the number of network participants stays the same. Is the list backwards? There also isn't any context on how big the miner is, how much his share increases, what a "participant is" etc.
I wouldn't call it an abuse, but increasing the blocksize indeed will decrease the number of participants (or validating miners anyways). So yes, it will lead you to the centralizing outcome.


There is latency, but a pool doesn't have to reach further out at all. They don't need to expand geographically, they only need to increase the population of hashers they control in the same region. In other words, the density increases which doesn't increase latency.

If you think 100% of miners not having this code is a problem then you already have a problem since many miners ignore OP_RETURN tx. The reason many of those miners block OP_RETURN is because it is harmful to the network, however including the hash in merged mining info isn't harmful and the miners blocking OP_RETURN should accept new code where you give them the hash as merged mining info.

1) Ethereum uses a hard-to-ASIC PoW. This is bad for consensus and bad in terms of centralization and scalability.
2) Ethereum is planned to have very low block times. This is bad for consensus.
3) Ethereum has three implementations supported. This is bad for consensus. [ex](
4) Ethereum advertises a lot of things that don't require consensus such as voting.
Surely someone who makes so many poor design decisions doesn't understand consensus. This is just scratching the surface though. I've seen numerous posts where Vitalek shows he doesn't understand PoW, PoS and other concepts and proposes ideas with huge attack vectors.

Mempool size and "unconfirmed transactions" aren't useful measures.
Mempool size is a function of both the blocksize and the relay cost. If you decrease the relay cost, you will increase mempool size. In fact, my full node could be sitting with 100,000,000 unconfirmed 0-fee transactions right now. 
You must ask yourself, "would I be claiming the blocksize needs to increase if everyone used a more conservative min relay fee causing there to be less **visible** unconfirmed transactions?" If the answer is yes, then you aren't using unconfirmed transactions as your measure for when the block size should increase and your point is moot. If the answer is no, then you might as well be complaining that the relay fee is too low because increasing it would solve the problem as well.
The fact is, the mempool is a tool to relay likely-to-be-confirmed transactions to everyone so it makes sense to include transactions that have a some probability of being confirmed as long as they aren't incredibly expensive to verify and relay even if they aren't guaranteed to make it into the next block.

No, it still makes sense because the intranet isn't part of the internet, while a blockchain connected to the Bitcoin blockchain would need to have bitcoin (the currency) to be secure. Here is some information on what a blockchain accomplishes  I recommend reading it because hopefully it will lead you to the understanding that "a private blockchain" doesn't make sense in either context.

No, it would be neither. Not relaying a block isn't the same as rejecting it. It would need to be propagated through other means, and assuming it is successfully, everyone would remain in consensus.

Yep. Do you see a problem with that? We can have thousands or even millions of sidechains.


Nope. I was explaining that there are properties of distributed consensus that make it inherently somewhat expensive and inefficient. If you can't afford the inefficiencies, then there's not much you can do.


I don't want to incrcease the block size, but you can have more transactions per second without increasing the block size.


Worst case scenario for increasing the block size? Only 50% upgrade despite Gavins genius "wait for a supermajority of miners" (despite the fact that a supermajority of miners mean nothing about the number of full nodes upgraded). People don't know whether to upgrade or not and no one transacts for a few days until it's sorted out which chain everyone else is going with. In that time, bitcoins price significantly drops and many people have their money stolen through doublespend attacks.

Stop being retards. Satoshi created Bitcoin SPECIFICALLY for avoiding 'services' like this.
By using them you are doing yourself a big dis-service. I don't even understand why you idiots are here since Blockchain.info goes against everything Bitcoin stands for.
Ask yourself this: What has Blockchain.info done for the Bitcoin ecosystem?
Are you aware that they are connected to thousands of nodes yet redesigned their software so they don't contribute to the network? Did you know that their misrepresentation of Bitcoin has caused an innocent man to get swatted?
Bitcoin Core, Electrum, any client that doesn't have web wallet security - the design of them and their security assumptions have been known since day one on bitcoin, but you morons prefer to keep your coins with a centralized, insecure, incompetent company that can serve you malicious code that steals your coins at any time.
I don't understand the world I'm living in anymore.
If it wasn't for my stash of coins which are currently under the buy-in value I would never get into Bitcoin. The value is not in adoption, the value is not in Blockchain.info. The value is in the principles and ideals that Satoshi created it for, and you are single-handledy unwittingly sabottaging yourself.
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:51:48
Well we have reached a fundamental disagreement then. I think the increasing block size leading to a huge decrease in the number of full nodes (the number of open port full nodes has dropped from 30k+ to less than 6k as the block size has increased) is indicative of how, while running a full node may be possible, users don't want to pay in bandwidth, storage, etc to run a full node. This is why I argue it must be passive to run a full node if we want a strong network.


I agree, but we have other alternatives to scaling linearly.
As you said,
    benefit of adoption &gt; cost of a diskspace with block increasing option
but my argument is
    benefit of adoption &gt; cost of a diskspace with block increasing option &gt; cost of sidechains

I don't see the relevance of anything before when OPEC started trying to put shale out of business. Going into the previous winters (when less gas is consumed) we saw a decline in oil produced, while this last year we saw an increase.
Obviously I wasn't referring to a massive 10 year period when discussing OPECs attempt at the destruction of American shale production. Their shale destruction attempt starts mid-late 2014 when they increase the amount of oil they produce drastically compared to the previous years.


America producing more oil is the cause of this, but indirectly. The price went down so OPEC could put the shale producers out of business.

Then you are using the wrong description for the miner. A miner isn't "large" because it produces large blocks, they are large because they provide much of the network hashrate.


It is though, running a full node is a constant expense,
    $500 per hour expense for mining rigs + cost of full node
will give you a higher profit margin than
    $100 per hour expense for mining rigs + cost of full node
because the full node remains a constant cost no matter how big you get.
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:15:51
Yes, did you read the part of my post where I respond to the part where you mention that exact fact?
Yes.. it isn't completely costless to process more transactions, but the cost of processing transactions with a minimal PoW isn't enough to secure the network. I cover this the paragraph immediately after what you quoted.

A hardfork is basically making an altcoin with everyone having the same amount of money they have in the Bitcoin system and hoping they all migrate over to the new altcoin. If you only a fraction of people migrate over then there is confusion over which currency is the "real" Bitcoin. Because two currencies separate are worth less than one currency as a whole, it harms Bitcoin unless the transition is very well executed.
In other words, hardforks are dangerous.

The attacks success requires running a full node to be costly. 1MB blocks aren't very costly and the attack likely wouldn't be successful.


No, there is literally nothing other than post-scarcity that can make 20x the bandwidth, 20x the storage, 20x the processing power cheaper. That would be nonsensical. It isn't a static snapshot of costs today, it's a view of the fundamentals of economics. 20 units of something is more expensive than one unit regardless of how cheap one unit is.

No, that is what the paper said they were trying to do to fix the problem. That stake modifier obscurity was their security feature.

Some critique:
* "These zeros indicate genesis" - more specifically, they are zero because that is where the previous block goes and there is no previous block.
* 0x29AB5F49 doesn't represent a date as "2009-1-3" suggests. It is the unix timestamp for 2009-01-03 18:15:05 exactly.
* Saying the nonce is an arbitrary number may imply that it can be set to anything, when really it is a crucial part of mining.
* "1 input" should specify that you are looking at a transaction now, not counting the total number of inputs in a block.
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:03:37


 I was being specific, my entire post is about Darkcoins broken security model. Bitcoin has a working security model (based on some security assumptions about mining).


Masternodes don't mean each full node gets paid. It means you get paid if you have (10,000 IIRC) Darkcoins. These full nodes don't necessarily do anything to support the network as full nodes (despite supporting the network through coinjoining).


No, did you ever read what I wrote? I didn't say it's too good to be true, I said it isn't true because it causes consensus problems.


If you assume there aren't any attacker... but pretty much every piece of security software works assuming no attackers.


You use a blockchain, but if you could somehow securely achieve consensus on a transactions ordering (as the masternodes are supposed to be doing by "locking" it) then you have created a new form of consensus. If you already can achieve consensus securely without a blockchain, you don't need one. Unfortunately, these instant confirmations by masternodes aren't a secure form of consensus since a small set of them can collude and break consensus.

There certainly will be people that will still run full nodes at $30/year in disk space (and whatever the cost is in bandwidth and electricity). Good on you for being one of them. I am concerned that the number of people that will do this is significantly less than the number of full node operators we have right now, which is why I am more interested in alternative solutions.


You are probably right, it just is easier to quantify disk usage since the global price is more constant.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:10:43


Hmm? Your wallet is local, not in a blockchain.


No, you pay someone in one blockchain. You can move coins between blockchains, but that is just so the coins are equally valued. Moving between blockchains is an inconvenience and is more for backing purposes than anything.
Because I pay you in some chain and you can redeem the coins in the mainchain, they have value. Since they have that value you don't have to redeem them in the mainchain, you can pay someone else who sees that same value.


Mining isn't relevant. You need to connect to a full node (or better yet, a set of them) to get a proof of payment.


Yes, in the 1% of blockchains you are a full node for, your full node will be used to serve data to other SPV clients just as you will be asking a full node for headers and proofs when you are using SPV mode.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:55:47
So he wants miners to check with every consensus implementation to see if it's valid? Basically every time a new client becomes popular we need a softfork and miners need to hack together a node that validates based on the rules of every client?
Is this really the solution? To have miners combine a bunch of different consensus rules every time a new client comes out?
This leads to full nodes either being insecure because you aren't validating the entire ruleset, or inefficient because they need to validate blocks multiple times.
Why not have a one consensus ruleset and avoid all the complexities and insecurities?
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:32:44


Then you shouldn't be pushing for btcd in the post. Btcd is **harmful** to consensus. Your proposal to have miners run multiple consensus implementations doesn't require btcd to exist and its existence doesn't benefit it.


As long as you agree that while this may benefit, it isn't a justification for harming the network with alternative consensus implementations.

With miners accepting it at that price. I'm guessing your question is about how all these transaction could fit into 1MB blocks and the answer is they can't. We would need to increase the blockspace. Sidechains are a solution for that, but limitless blockspace comes with its own set of problems. Justus was suggesting that these problems work themselves out and my post was a response to that. I believe there are solutions, but making the blockspace essentially limitless isn't a solution in it of itself.

No, clearly infeasible and even if it were feasible, silly.


The average node will of course upload as many blocks as they will download. You are causing the network to use more bandwidth, yes, but since an average node will upload as much as it will download, it won't "free" more bandwidth, it will simply use the bandwidth another node could have used and then relay a block, making it effectively bandwidth neutral.
However, this isn't the only effect it has, it also increases the total time required to relay a block, making consensus slightly weaker.
More importantly these people are making it more difficult to determine which nodes are run by individuals and which nodes are run by Amazon. It makes it more likely that all of my peers are run by Amazon, which greatly reduces my security. 
These people running these nodes are either
* confused about Bitcoin security and believe they have full node security when in fact they have SPV security or
* maliciously sybil attacking in attempt to inflate Classics apparent node count

This section of the source code defines the public key of the person, presumably Josh Garza, who can create "automatic checkpoints". These automatic checkpoints can be used at any time declare an entire fork, even the mainchain, to be invalid.
These automatic checkpoints shouldn't to be confused with Bitcoins checkpoints which can't be updated and are for spam prevention. If you want to read more about the purpose of Bitcoin checkpoints and how they're not the same thing, read the bottom of this post.
Back to the automatic checkponts. These checkpoints are a message that propagates across the network and are applied to the blockchain. When they are applied, one fork is declared valid which in many ways is similar to what a 51% miner can do... with the exception that getting this 51% status was completely free to obtain and is part of the program.
Why are these checkpoints here? Because this is a fork of Peercoin and Peercoin cannot work without it. With Peercoin, you can generate forks for free. When it is "your turn" to generate a block, you can generate a very very large number of blocks. An attacker might generate 100000000 blocks (slightly modifying them each time) so they produce a different signature every block eventually leading to them being the winner of the next block. In the right conditions you can grind and designate yourself winner of the preceeding block over and over again.
Peercoin introduces other problems fundamental to their system. "Nothing at stake" describes the problem where users who had stake at one time (maybe an hour ago) and no longer do, can create forks from when they had stake. Because they can create forks for free, and these forks may be profitable, large reorgs are a large risk.
With Bitcoin, creating a 6 block reorg involves expending a bunch of resources since work valid for one block cannot be redone for another block. With PoS, that doesn't apply, you can be the winner with your "simulated mining rig" at a certain time, but that winning is for that time, not that block. Because of this, you can create a large number of forks after that block for no cost.
The two attack vectors I mentioned are just scratching the surface and not exhaustive. The fundamental flaws with PoS in general allow many many attack vectors. [Here is a general overview of the problems with PoS that apply to **all** PoS cryptocurrencies]( (and no, adding a "D" in front of PoS doesn't disclude it if you read how PoS is defined).
If you read the "debunkings" of these problems, you can see a problem that the posters seem to follow: they see one attack vector and make assumptions about how the nodes could operate to prevent this and break it in other ways. Or they make assumptions that imply they don't understand the nothing-at-stake problem, described in the link above, at all. For example, they may say "Nothing-at-Stake assumes that a stake doesn't have value, which is false.". This is a clear misunderstanding of the NaS, stake doesn't have value if you can't spend it and you can't spend it if you already have. You **can** however create a fork from the point where you had stake.
**Bitcoin Checkpoints**
Bitcoin checkpoints *were* designed to prevent spam. A user could create 10,000 difficulty 1 blocks from block 2 where difficulty was 1 easily, and you would need to download all 10,000 1mb blocks to realize they were just tricking you and didn't really have the best chain. This doesn't prevent consensus, but it is annoying.
Bitcoin checkpoints are static and designed to *not* force reorgs. When a new version comes out, the checkpoints are typically 1000 or so blocks behind the network. An attacker making a 1000 block reorg would destroy Bitcoin anyways, so a 1000 block reorg consensus break between versions isn't considered a risk.
Once again, Bitcoin checkpoints are meant to **not** force a reorg, they shouldn't ever effect which blockchain is the mainchain, they are an antispam feature. With peercoin the checkpoints are **designed** to force a reorg and they do effect which blockchain is the mainchain. With the new Bitcoin version, the spam problem has hopefully been fixed since **they are being removed**.

You are just playing semantic games. You don't want miners to become hashers, that is what is fixed by making running a full node easy.


No, ALL hashers don't run a full node. You are semantically masturbating, 0% of hashers run full nodes because a hasher is a miner that DOESNT RUN A FULL NODE. If you're going to look at the subset of miners that don't run full nodes and say "hey 0% of these guys run full nodes" then you're going to do a great job of demonstrating what the definition means, but you won't demonstrate anything about the mining ecosystem.


If you want to trade decentralization with efficiency then you should use a centralized service like Visa.

That probably should be done, but isn't what the linked webpage exclusively said. The impression I got from the webpage was "it is a red herring to point out that btcd will break consensus since the consensus everyone else is using may break".
Realistically we should try to minimize failures, we shouldn't say "this may cause a failure, but that's okay because this other thing has a chance of failure too".


I was referring to the suggestion that miners make blocks based on multiple consensus implementations. I was pointing out that everyone would need to run those same implementations unless they want a fakeconf attack. If everyone ran all those consensus implementations, consensus would be slower and confirmations would be weaker making the network weaker as a whole.
You are suggesting adding more complexity to the benefit of...... not having to change btcds codebase? at the cost of much less secure network.

It isn't a set number. 2MB may be too much for some. 20MB may be fine for others.

Transactions are the fastest in Bitcoin. What you are thinking of is a smaller confirmation interval, but with Litecoin for example, the confirmation is 4 time faster, but each confirmation means 100 times less. Bitcoins transactions are fastest in that it takes the least amount of time to be the most secure.


This is one of the useful altcoins.

This is really vague. Bitcoin already has coin issuing...


This is where the 5 minutes of research come in. Do a little more than 5 minutes of research and you'll come to understand what the blockchain is for. Blockchains aren't useful for messaging since messages don't require consensus, nor does a decentralized marketplace.

Making real life analogies for Bitcoin doesn't work usually. In a Bitcoin transaction on the blockchain it is unknown whether you are paying someone or yourself. It becomes  confusing if you try to redefine a transaction as a payment to someone else in Bitcoin since you don't know that just by looking at it.
Feel free to come up with words for a transactions that are
* Paying someone - (paymentx maybe?)
* Paying yourself - (masturbatx maybe?)
* Unknown
The word transaction is already used for all three of these so changing that just makes it confusing.

What is his basis for this, this makes no sense whatsoever. If the 1MB block size limit is reached, then people will compete with transaction fees for block space. Miners will accept the highest bid.


The difference is that block space is basically free to produce for miners. Combined with the miners competition, this leads to very small rewards. Also, unlike burgers, the total value of the transaction processing a miner does in a day secures a currency. It must be high enough to prevent attack, price discovery in a way that makes the total fee sum for a day a few thousand dollars doesn't secure the network sufficiently.


Constructing the blocks for the worlds transactions for a day is insanely cheap. For 10 billion people making 20 transactions a day (a high estimate) you need only 20 trillion ECDSA operations per day or 2000 per second which a high end CPU can do! The cost of actually constructing a block is probably a few thousand dollars at most when you factor in electricity, bandwidth and storage.
Justus is completely disregarding what secures the network, the PoW. It needs to be expensive to make a fork for the network to be secure. If the price ends up being the cost of constructing a block, the difficulty will continue to drop until it is at 1.
The cost of generating a block **needs** to be more than the cost of creating the blocks structure and storing it.


If there is not enough market demand for Bitcoin transactions such to pay for sufficient hashing power to protect the network, then Bitcoin will fail.
This will happen with or without a block size limit.
Yes, if the hashrate isn't sufficient to secure the network, then bitcoin fails with or without a block size limit.
Justus fails to address the point here though because simply having a larger block size without any solutions such as demmurage **causes** the hashrate to fall.
It's as if while arguing whether theft upset people he said "well people are going to be upset whenever they lose money regardless of whether it is a theft". It just is nonsensical.


Natural monopolies apply to Bitcoin especially because once you have 51% of the hash power, you have the economies of scale to be infinitely more profitable than every other miner combined.

If you are making smaller blocks then you are making less money in transaction fees. You must have some other way to compensate for this (maybe people will mine in places far away from everyone else, but have cheap electricity).


I wouldn't be surprised if he was right by now.

Even if you aren't running a full node, increasing the block size effects you because the decrease in the number of full nodes makes the blockchain less secure.


Do you mean the main blockchain when you say Bitcoin? I'll assume so.
It probably can work fine, but if it is necessary to hardfork (likely for some block-size unrelated reason), we might as well adjust it to a value that closer reflects what an average PC can do passively at the time (probably a significant increase). Because hardforks are dangerous and increasing the block size isn't necessary as far as I can see, we shouldn't do it until we need to.


what happens when? In 2050 if/when we have 7tps? The Bitcoin users will always bear the cost of decentralization by definition since they are using the decentralized network. I'm not sure what the argument is here.


I'd argue it's the exact opposite of unfair and inefficient. Inefficient is everyone processing every copy of every transaction. Efficient is splitting up the blockchains so individuals can contribute to the networks security even if they can't process every transaction that the network has. I don't want to enter into the realm of ethics, but because sidechains don't involve a hardfork, I'd argue it's more fair than increasing the block size.


Your premise that it's a pointless losing battle is wrong IMO. Even if it is a losing battle, wouldn't you want to lose the least full nodes possible by minimizing the costs rather than losing a ton and saying "welp it's a losing battle anyways", thus causing a less secure network?


They are part of the discussion, you even stated to me "it sounds like you really don't want to increase the block size at all". Sidechains are an alternative to that.


If it works fine I don't see why not? Data structures usually don't grow as disk space grows larger. Despite being able to store 1000 times the data on a $100 thumb drive you could store one a 2003 $100 thumb drive, we haven't made documents, images and videos 1000 times larger.


The idea isn't to **let** people run full nodes because they have some urge to, it's to allow as many people as possible to contribute to network security.
Are you aware that most miners don't audit the blocks their mining pools send them? Most of the reasoning there is that running a full node is too bandwidth or CPU or time costly.
"even though they never, ever will nor intend to" - if they never intended to run a full node, they probably will run an SPV node. Once again, the idea isn't to get people to run full nodes because it's neato and fun, it's a significant part of network security.


Yes, and less and less of these will be running full nodes if it takes a significant amount of resources to do so.

Given that we have 10,000+ full nodes validating the 0.4mb/10min mainchain, we can have 100+ validating 100 other blockchains through sidechain technology. This doesn't require anyone to use more diskspace, (though it gives you the option to) and allows scaling with the number of full nodes TIMES their processing power rather than their processing power alone. You can consider this O(mn).


Indeed, SPV clients are part of the scaling solution.


This is part of what I was talking about when I mentioned passively running a full node. You will be downloading 70kb/sec AND processing a ton of ECDSA operations per second. It will be fine for many full nodes, but for some it won't.
Where do we stop? Once bitcoin has grown 10x again, we will end up at 700kb/s of tx. Can you passively run a full node with 10tb/year 700tx/s, etc?
I am certainly not arguing that a person can run a full node at 10mb/min, I am just saying that the number of validating nodes would decline.


Because I have port 8333 unblocked and new nodes use me to catch up.


As said above, you clearly can run a full node, it's just a question of how many will.

The information asymmetries are irrelevant by nature of their incentives not being perfectly aligned (if attacks could be stopped simply by being public then the incentives would be aligned with regards to publicizable attacks). There have been public attacks by large miners in which thousands of Bitcoins were stolen so your baseless proposition is contradicted by history.


... you must have no understanding of the mining ecosystem what-so-ever. Basically every miner completes a partial proof of work through a pool. This isn't novel in the slightest.


You are ignoring the part of my post where I said that just because their idea doesn't work doesn't mean mine does. Your selective reading must be convenient to you, but for those in search of signal, it is a major annoyance.
Here, let me repeat myself. **OPs idea is terrible, we are better off doing things how we currently are. And we may want to explore other options beyond what we're currently doing including what I proposed. However, this doesn't mean that we have to use the what I proposed rather than OPs idea, we could simply continue doing what we're currently doing.** So no, by basic logic, this doesn't mean that I'm saying we should do the other options "because [I] inherently don't believe in mining on top of headers".

Satoshi probably is wrong on this one. Requiring a datacenter means that only datacenters can audit blocks. If a miner isn't auditing a block and you aren't auditing the block, you are blindly accepting whatever the datacenter decides to put in a block, be it a valid transaction or not.

I was pointing out that the cheapness of a reorg isn't the concern.

Obviously bloom filters take constant time to validate that a transaction is in a block, but there may be other factors that come in and make it non-constant.

You use an SPV client and connect to full nodes on that blockchain.


Generally there won't be any "connecting spends" to get it onto your blockchain. You will either be told by an SPV server (a full node) that you were paid or the payer will tell you.

I am not jumping around, you are making comments and I am directly replying to them.


I'm talking about the winter production we have seen, clearly. Coming into the winter months you can see a trend of less oil being produced and this year you can see more being produced in this time period. The cause of this is the OPEC decision I explained. 


Because there was more demand for oil those years. They come to agreement on how much to produce by analyzing the market.

Because people have different internet plans with different bandwidth and different amounts of free space of their harddrive, etc, the number isn't set. As I explained, the higher the block size, the less full nodes you will tend to have.

At the risk of going on a tangent, the blockchain doesn't track balances, it track transactions and outputs.
What do you mean "are validating or not"? You can have an SPV proof that you have been paid if that's what you mean?


Your "receiving address" probably won't be chain specific. Addresses are just strings used to create a payment script and that script would be compatible with most sidechains. If you have the luxury of two way communication, you could negotiate a chain to pay on.


Indeed, but the money going back to the mainchain is just for backing purposes. In most cases there isn't a reason to move between chains.

20MB blocks being possible on an average computer doesn't mean it is practical. I can **passively** run a full node an my laptop, desktop and server, and I do because it is easy. 20MB blocks would mean that my CPU would be handing 70tx per second, constantly downloading 70tx per second and probably uploading more, and taking up a **terabyte** of disk space each year.
Right now with 0.4MB blocks we are seeing a 1-2% reorg rate. With 20MB blocks, we would probably see a much higher reorg rate and weaker consensus.
And does this solve the problem? I don't think so. If Bitcoin is to grow as fast as it has been, you will reach the block cap pretty fast. Basically this proposal hopes that Bitcoin only grows as fast as CPUs get cheaper, which I don't think is realistic.

How can one possibly say people who aren't tech savvy will enjoy reading a webpages source code and constructing a text string to send to a server in order to post on a website. Oh wait, a program does that for us, just as the program would determine how much you would need to bid in order for your transaction to be confirmed in a reasonable amount of time.


There already is a bidding war and price finding for a consumer to have the scarce resources of bankers, bandwidth and payment infrastructure when you use a credit card.
You are making it sound as if a consumer will be active in speculating and bidding on the price when in reality. With credit cards, most consumers aren't involved in trying to get the best deal on a transaction fee, they just see that the card companies have a certain offer and they take it or don't, just as in Bitcoin they will see "pay a cent to process transaction" and accept it or not.
If you don't like that analogy, ignore it, just take away from this response that there is no reason bitcoiners would need to actively "join a worldwide bidding war". You are right that there would be a bidding war, but it would all be going on behind the scenes in your wallet.


Price doesn't secure the network, price x feesum secures the network. The fees are 100 bitcoins per day and the price is $100 per bitcoin, it is more secure than if the price were $1000 and the rewards were 1 bitcoin per day for obvious reasons.


Not if you are coming to a price equilibrium for a resource that is dirt cheap.
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:18:47


Probably whatever the merchant wants. I'd guess you would usually optimize it so it was likely to be confirmed next block.


I'm not psychic, but it would probably be optimized so it is both secure enough for the network to run and cheap enough for people to use it without the fee being problematic. If I were to take a wild guess, it will be between 1/10 cents and 10 cents.


Perhaps, at least a decentralized solution would. Decentralized consensus doesn't have many of the benefits that centralized systems have and transactions sent to a decentralized network have to be worth enough to not be a DoS vulnerability to miners and full nodes. If someone wants to make 20 cent payments to someone and there is a 5 cent fee, that may be too much. The solution is to move to a centralized service (as they have now with their fiat currency) to pay them.
Keeping Bitcoin decentralized is inherently expensive and decentralized currency is a luxury that only those who can afford the fee (maybe a few pennies) can enjoy. 
It is unfortunate that we may not be able to give trustless currency to the poor, but at the same time it is unfortunate that we can't give them all iPads to make their transactions on...


If the merchant accepts Bitcoins then you can pay them.. I'd say that's a pretty good usecase. (Note that this isn't me saying everyone will need to use an off-chain intermediary, it is just an answer to your question).

I did tell you why that article didn't convince me, because it doesn't even touch on the dangers. If you had asked what the dangers of hard forks were in that message, as you have in this message  then I would have answered that instead.


1) Everyone needs to upgrade, and everyone who doesn't upgrade is at great risk of theft. It cost very little to defraud someone, all you need is a transaction thats invalid on the new blockchain and valid on the old, send it to them, it only gets confirmed on the old, and you have made a bunch of money. Softforks don't have this risk.
2) You need to invoke trust. With soft forks, you don't need to upgrade to be in consensus. This means you don't need to trust that the core developers, Bitcoin.org, etc are giving you correct consensus rules. All you need is to run the client you've always been running and follow the tallest valid blockchain. In a hard fork you need some entity to tell you what the new rules you should be following are. This exposes the users and the currency, and is a (temporary) form of centralization.
3) Hard forks have never been done, not even by Satoshi, with good reason. He doesn't want to be a central authority dictating the new rules by which Bitcoin will operate, nor do other the core developers.

@_date: 2015-05-08 04:45:16


Because it is? 
Have you thought about any of this? Last time we discussed this I had to stop because you were ignoring basic considerations. What are the costs of running a pool? Do you know of them? Can you think of how it scales? Can you think of how many full nodes you have to run to operate a 1% pool? a 30% pool? In both cases its a number between 0 and 2. Does running a full node become more expensive with more hash power? No. So now that I've done that part of the thinking for you, is a full node a larger percentage of your costs at 1% or 30%? I'll give you a hint, it's the smaller number.
I don't see what is so hard to understand, you are playing these semantic and avoidance games when you consider "pools" to be exclusively variance reduction organizations when I explicitly said that the problem was the pools creating unaudited blocks and your defining of "hashers" as if it had some implication in mining.
The simple truth is that as it becomes less efficient to be a small full-node-miner, less people will be small full-node-miners and will outsource their block production and auditing to large miners which is centralization.

Agreed upon by everyone using Bitcoin. Regarding consensus, the blockchain is an algorithm for maintaining distributed consensus. If you have people not in consensus with the Bitcoin users then they can't tell which bitcoins are real and which are fake, and they aren't really using Bitcoin.


Explicitly centralizes is more along the lines of designating a central authority to run the currency in the code. The mining ecosystem is bad right now though, I agree, which is why we need to not introduce new centralizing pressures.

No, this is just fucking stupid. You are completely unable to read what I've said. Here is everything I've said about pools:
UNAUDITED pools will grow with a block size increase and that's problem:


It is bad to delegate POWER to pools and not AUDIT their blocks


It is a problem to give pools POWER without AUDITING them. It is fine if you TAKE that POWER and AUDIT them:


It is a PROBLEM to give UNAUDITED pools POWER over your block generation:


If you TAKE the POWER from the pools, and AUDIT/CREATE the blocks yourself then there is no problem:


It is possible to be in a pool and generate your own blocks:


I really don't know how to make it any more clear. A pool is a variance reduction tool, and because they happen to be able to offer full-node outsourcing you immediately associate the two and despite me saying many times that pools are a problem if you outsource and not a problem if you run your own full node, you are hung up on the fact that the word "pool" is used.

As far as I can see, the cost is the redundant UTXOs in the blockchain (an ouptut must now be in the blockchain twice) causing additional bandwidth and additional block space used.
The benefit is the storage of an individual UTXO in the database is now 32 bytes. However, a typical (P2PKH) output is only slightly larger than that (though the output can be LESS than 32 bytes).
So basically this will only allow a computer store *slightly* more of the UTXO database in memory and can't be considered a significant improvement if even an improvement at all.

There are two types of people who say that. Misinformed people, and people trying to misinform. The Blockstream FUD is really annoying because it's trivial to disprove. Maxwell and many other core developers have understood long before Blockstreams ideation and creation that Bitcoin cannot safely scale through larger blocks, and Blockstream employees are far from being the only core developers that understand this.
There is indeed a correlation between being a Blockstream employee and wanting smaller blocks, **because** there is a correlation between being a Blockstream employee and understanding cryptography and Bitcoin.

Regardless of your opinion, a miner running a full node does improve network health.


I have literally never heard this until now. It seems like a strawman so you can produce the fun fact that Bitcoin had 16MB blocks at one point. You may be misinterpreting complaints about a hardfork, but I have only heard pro-size-increase people talk about something as irrelevant as how the client operated at one point, but no longer does.


Disk space is the cheapest part of running a full node. Even so, any cost of running a full node is more expensive for a miner than asking a centralized service to give them blocks and pay them for their work. In order to maintain decentralization, a good number of miners have to be running full nodes and to accomplish the full nods need to be cheap.


Is it way easier to perform a DoS attack when you are limited to 100kb/s as opposed to something high? Of course not???


Probably because there is a small block size of 1MB limit preventing them???


Your attack is pretty vague, but when there is unused block space it can be very cheap for a miner to fill it.

Yes it is in the UTXO set, though it could be removed with a softfork, it just isn't really a concern at this point since it would only save the space of a handful of transactions.

Their security model. Anyone can write a distributed networking application that works until someone reverse engineers and attacks it.


Masternodes create incentive problems, but that is a minor issue compared to the problem of master nodes not really having a point. Since coinjoining was already possible in Bitcoin, there isn't much reason to create an altcoin for coinjoining.
The instant transactions are laughable. Having a "video" as proof of instant transactions displays a complete lack of understanding of security and incentives. I could make a video just as easily of my client saying "LOL I GOT MY BITCOINS AND THEY'RE SECURE", but that wouldn't be a proof that the transactions was confirmed and secure. The darkcoin instant transaction scheme, last I looked at the whitepaper (it may have changed), involved master nodes being able to break consensus for an individual in a way that they can never regain it.

What work have you done to improve Bitcoin?
A **SUBSET** of Bitcoin Core improvements over the last year and a half:
* Validation speed and network propagation performance have been greatly improved, leading to much shorter sync and initial block download times.
* The script signature cache has been reimplemented as a “cuckoo cache”, allowing for more signatures to be cached and faster lookups.
Assumed-valid blocks have been introduced which allows script validation to be skipped for ancestors of known-good blocks, without changing the security model. See below for more details.
In some cases, compact blocks are now relayed before being fully validated as per BIP152.
P2P networking has been refactored with a focus on concurrency and throughput. Network operations are no longer bottlenecked by validation. As a result, block fetching is several times faster than previous releases in many cases.
The UTXO cache now claims unused mempool memory. This speeds up initial block download as UTXO lookups are a major bottleneck there, and there is no use for the mempool at that stage.
Manual Pruning
* Bitcoin Core has supported automatically pruning the blockchain since 0.11. Pruning the blockchain allows for significant storage space savings as the vast majority of the downloaded data can be discarded after processing so very little of it remains on the disk.
* Manual block pruning can now be enabled by setting -prune=1. Once that is set, the RPC command pruneblockchain can be used to prune the blockchain up to the specified height or timestamp.
* **Change to wallet handling of mempool rejection**
When a newly created transaction failed to enter the mempool due to the limits on chains of unconfirmed transactions the sending RPC calls would return an error. The transaction would still be queued in the wallet and, once some of the parent transactions were confirmed, broadcast after the software was restarted.
This behavior has been changed to return success and to reattempt mempool insertion at the same time transaction rebroadcast is attempted, avoiding a need for a restart.
Transactions in the wallet which cannot be accepted into the mempool can be abandoned with the previously existing abandontransaction RPC (or in the GUI via a context menu on the transaction).
**Segregated witness soft fork**
* Segregated witness (segwit) is a soft fork that, if activated, will allow transaction-producing software to separate (segregate) transaction signatures (witnesses) from the part of the data in a transaction that is covered by the txid. This provides several immediate benefits:
* Elimination of unwanted transaction malleability: Segregating the witness allows both existing and upgraded software to calculate the transaction identifier (txid) of transactions without referencing the witness, which can sometimes be changed by third-parties (such as miners) or by co-signers in a multisig spend. This solves all known cases of unwanted transaction malleability, which is a problem that makes programming Bitcoin wallet software more difficult and which seriously complicates the design of smart contracts for Bitcoin.
* Capacity increase: Segwit transactions contain new fields that are not part of the data currently used to calculate the size of a block, which allows a block containing segwit transactions to hold more data than allowed by the current maximum block size. Estimates based on the transactions currently found in blocks indicate that if all wallets switch to using segwit, the network will be able to support about 70% more transactions. The network will also be able to support more of the advanced-style payments (such as multisig) than it can support now because of the different weighting given to different parts of a transaction after segwit activates (see the following section for details).
* Weighting data based on how it affects node performance: Some parts of each Bitcoin block need to be stored by nodes in order to validate future blocks; other parts of a block can be immediately forgotten (pruned) or used only for helping other nodes sync their copy of the block chain. One large part of the immediately prunable data are transaction signatures (witnesses), and segwit makes it possible to give a different “weight” to segregated witnesses to correspond with the lower demands they place on node resources. Specifically, each byte of a segregated witness is given a weight of 1, each other byte in a block is given a weight of 4, and the maximum allowed weight of a block is 4 million. Weighting the data this way better aligns the most profitable strategy for creating blocks with the long-term costs of block validation.
* Signature covers value: A simple improvement in the way signatures are generated in segwit simplifies the design of secure signature generators (such as hardware wallets), reduces the amount of data the signature generator needs to download, and allows the signature generator to operate more quickly. This is made possible by having the generator sign the amount of bitcoins they think they are spending, and by having full nodes refuse to accept those signatures unless the amount of bitcoins being spent is exactly the same as was signed. For non-segwit transactions, wallets instead had to download the complete previous transactions being spent for every payment they made, which could be a slow operation on hardware wallets and in other situations where bandwidth or computation speed was constrained.
* Linear scaling of sighash operations: In 2015 a block was produced that required about 25 seconds to validate on modern hardware because of the way transaction signature hashes are performed. Other similar blocks, or blocks that could take even longer to validate, can still be produced today. The problem that caused this can’t be fixed in a soft fork without unwanted side-effects, but transactions that opt-in to using segwit will now use a different signature method that doesn’t suffer from this problem and doesn’t have any unwanted side-effects.
* Increased security for multisig: Bitcoin addresses (both P2PKH addresses that start with a ‘1’ and P2SH addresses that start with a ‘3’) use a hash function known as RIPEMD-160. For P2PKH addresses, this provides about 160 bits of security—which is beyond what cryptographers believe can be broken today. But because P2SH is more flexible, only about 80 bits of security is provided per address. Although 80 bits is very strong security, it is within the realm of possibility that it can be broken by a powerful adversary. Segwit allows advanced transactions to use the SHA256 hash function instead, which provides about 128 bits of security (that is 281 trillion times as much security as 80 bits and is equivalent to the maximum bits of security believed to be provided by Bitcoin’s choice of parameters for its Elliptic Curve Digital Security Algorithm [ECDSA].)
* More efficient almost-full-node security Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin paper describes a method for allowing newly-started full nodes to skip downloading and validating some data from historic blocks that are protected by large amounts of proof of work. Unfortunately, Nakamoto’s method can’t guarantee that a newly-started node using this method will produce an accurate copy of Bitcoin’s current ledger (called the UTXO set), making the node vulnerable to falling out of consensus with other nodes. Although the problems with Nakamoto’s method can’t be fixed in a soft fork, Segwit accomplishes something similar to his original proposal: it makes it possible for a node to optionally skip downloading some blockchain data (specifically, the segregated witnesses) while still ensuring that the node can build an accurate copy of the UTXO set for the block chain with the most proof of work. Segwit enables this capability at the consensus layer, but note that Bitcoin Core does not provide an option to use this capability as of this 0.13.1 release.
* Script versioning: Segwit makes it easy for future soft forks to allow Bitcoin users to individually opt-in to almost any change in the Bitcoin Script language when those users receive new transactions. Features currently being researched by Bitcoin Core contributors that may use this capability include support for Schnorr signatures, which can improve the privacy and efficiency of multisig transactions (or transactions with multiple inputs), and Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), which can improve the privacy and efficiency of scripts with two or more conditions. Other Bitcoin community members are studying several other improvements that can be made using script versioning.
* Activation for the segwit soft fork is being managed using BIP9 versionbits. Segwit’s version bit is bit 1, and nodes will begin tracking which blocks signal support for segwit at the beginning of the first retarget period after segwit’s start date of 15 November 2016. If 95% of blocks within a 2,016-block retarget period (about two weeks) signal support for segwit, the soft fork will be locked in. After another 2,016 blocks, segwit will activate.

Ignoring the contents of a hardfork (the hardfork changes themselves may be centralizing) it requires you to trust a central authority or set of central authorities to trust and tell you the new consensus rules. You also have to trust the miners to fix any consensus problems that result as we saw in the v0.8 fork.

Bitcoin core already has floating fees. Plenty of fee based changes have been made to the software, this isn't a very big concern.


Usually markets aren't destroyed when the supply increases, in fact, increase in supply is a regular occurrence for basically every commodity.


It doesn't makes sense if you ignore the negative consequences of raising the limit. Sure, if we could raise the limit with no consequences I'd be all for it, in fact I'd say "fuck the lightning network because we can just keep increasing the block size". Unfortunately that isn't the case.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:10:24


The required auditing and updating of every full node in a short period of time failing means that the currency splits into two.
The thing is we don't need a hardfork for quite a while. We have plenty of time to reach 1MB blocks and plenty of time for a fee market to be in place. In that time we other methods of transacting can be created that have varying degrees of trust, from very low with lightning network to moderate with OT to high with changetip. We can allow people to use Bitcoin in various ways where they feel they are sufficiently risk averse, what we can't afford is to increase the risk baseline and make the mining ecosystem very risky.


Yes, somehow people could go against the apparent economics of the situation and mining could become less decentralized, but I don't see that happening.

Miners are mostly irrelevant to consensus.

Bitcoin being centralized isn't a problem for you?
@_date: 2015-05-12 15:14:38


Okay, you are once again failing to understand supply and demand. If there is a limited blockspace then only those who can pay the fees necessary will have their transactions confirmed. There won't be hundreds of thousands of people willing to pay the high fees necessary to have their transaction in a block, otherwise the high demand would increase the price so there weren't that many.
This isn't to say you can't have out-of-blockchain transactions in the meantime, it's just that we don't need/can't afford every small transaction  being in the blockchain.


Perhaps you should read a few proposals for scalability including the lightning network and open transactions. Your view of scalability semes to be limited to "everyone needs to see every transaction and we can't scale through methods other than increasing the block size".

As time goes on, ASICs can be optimized less and less causing the cost of mining to shift from the hardware to the electricity. This causes manufacturers to ship the ASICs to ship ASICs to those who have the cheapest electricity because during shipping less money is lost and more value is gained from the low-power-cost individuals mining.


Being "more" ASIC resistant isn't a good thing, I never claimed there would be a larger efficiency, I only explained that there would be a benefit from ASICs, making the old hardware obsolete. Even worse, we would likely have a PoW that is expensive to verify, which centralizes the system.

No, because that would be incorrect, we allow discussion of all Bitcoin clients. This isn't a difficult concept to grasp, I don't know what your issue is in doing so. A client that doesn't implement BITCOINs consensus rules isn't a BITCOIN client. If you want to add fancy financial management tools to your client, have special transaction type construction utilities, manage your mempool differently, that is still a BITCOIN client, **unless** it doesn't conform to Bitcoins consensus.

That creates an incentive to orphan, which is probably one of the worst things you can do for a blockchain consensus system. If I was a miner who was paid for all his orphans, I'd be selfish mining at any percent.

No, when the mining reward decreases again from 12.5 to 6.25 in 2 years, unless we want network security incentives to halve, we need to have transaction fees take up a significant portion of miner revenue.

No, this goes against basic logic. If there is a blocksize cap and full blocks, then there will naturally be fee pressure. The cost of accepting a free transaction is the cost of allocating that blockspace that could be used for a higher fee transaction to a zero-fee transaction.

They can't expand the set of valid blocks, but they certainly can contract it. I was ambiguous at first, I apologize. Expanding the rules can make it sound like you're making them broader and more is allowed, or you could be growing the rules, meaning growing the set of constraints. This is why I've tried to be more clear and said "adds constraints".


It maintains consensus, so I don't see why it's inherently problematic. The process of consensus is unaffected.

Because you stating it is "weird" doesn't contradict the research around it. Chiseling away at the security around Bitcoin under the false assumption that miners incentives are perfectly aligned with stake holder incentives is silly. They aren't perfectly aligned and pretending they are is a waste of both of our time.


Not if you have a DoS prevention mechanism such as requiring a smaller PoW, a prior block, or something else.

Mining pools generally suck. It is best to limit their centralization because historically they have not only abused users, but they have practiced the exact incompetence you are suggesting they wouldn't be incompetent in a way [they have already demonstrated they can be](


Not the person you were responding to, but the reasoning has been stated over and over again and gets tiresome to explain: if you want a centralized payment processor that is super cheap, you don't even need a blockchain, you're welcome to go make your own! What we have is a decentralized currency, and maintaining that value proposition is critical to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-20 01:48:04
I predict that would be prohibitively expensive. Consider that to increase 70% of miners revenues by 1% you would need to add $100k/week to this fund.
I'm also concerned with giving mining pools the incentive to decide these things. Ideally individual miners would fully validate and determine how their Bitcoin block was formed.

Because it is so simple, manufacturers were able to optimize quickly to the point we are at now where there isn't much else you can do to improve.


No, it has the opposite effect as I explained. The harder it is to make an ASIC, the longer a company benefits from their slight optimization, which is a strong centralizing factor.


GPUs are already out of the game when you start making ASICs, why would you mine for a 10% loss on a GPU let alone a more realistic 99%?
You also have the problem of Botnets, but even without considering botnets, SHA256 and ASICs are clearly beneficial.

**Null dummy soft fork**
* Combined with the segwit soft fork is an additional change that turns a long-existing network relay policy into a consensus rule. The OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY opcodes consume an extra stack element (“dummy element”) after signature validation. The dummy element is not inspected in any manner, and could be replaced by any value without invalidating the script.
* Because any value can be used for this dummy element, it’s possible for a third-party to insert data into other people’s transactions, changing the transaction’s txid (called transaction malleability) and possibly causing other problems.
* Since Bitcoin Core 0.10.0, nodes have defaulted to only relaying and mining transactions whose dummy element was a null value (0x00, also called OP_0). The null dummy soft fork turns this relay rule into a consensus rule both for non-segwit transactions and segwit transactions, so that this method of mutating transactions is permanently eliminated from the network.
* Signaling for the null dummy soft fork is done by signaling support for segwit, and the null dummy soft fork will activate at the same time as segwit.
**Database cache memory increased**
* As a result of growth of the UTXO set, performance with the prior default database cache of 100 MiB has suffered. For this reason the default was changed to 300 MiB in this release.
* For nodes on low-memory systems, the database cache can be changed back to 100 MiB (or to another value) by either:
* Adding dbcache=100 in bitcoin.conf
Changing it in the GUI under Options → Size of database cache
Note that the database cache setting has the most performance impact during initial sync of a node, and when catching up after downtime.
**bitcoin-cli: arguments privacy**
* The RPC command line client gained a new argument, -stdin to read extra arguments from standard input, one per line until EOF/Ctrl-D. For example:
    $ src/bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase
    mysecretcode
    120
    ..... press Ctrl-D here to end input
    $
* It is recommended to use this for sensitive information such as wallet passphrases, as command-line arguments can usually be read from the process table by any user on the system.
**C++11 and Python 3**
* Various code modernizations have been done. The Bitcoin Core code base has started using C++11. This means that a C++11-capable compiler is now needed for building. Effectively this means GCC 4.7 or higher, or Clang 3.3 or higher.
* When cross-compiling for a target that doesn’t have C++11 libraries, configure with ./configure --enable-glibc-back-compat ... LDFLAGS=-static-libstdc++.
* For running the functional tests in qa/rpc-tests, Python3.4 or higher is now required.
**Linux ARM builds**
* Due to popular request, Linux ARM builds have been added to the uploaded executables.
* The following extra files can be found in the download directory or torrent:
    bitcoin-${VERSION}-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz: Linux binaries for the most common 32-bit ARM architecture.
    bitcoin-${VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: Linux binaries for the most common 64-bit ARM architecture.
* ARM builds are still experimental. If you have problems on a certain device or Linux distribution combination please report them on the bug tracker, it may be possible to resolve them.
* Note that Android is not considered ARM Linux in this context. The executables are not expected to work out of the box on Android.
**Compact Block support (BIP 152)**
* Support for block relay using the Compact Blocks protocol has been implemented in PR 8068.
* The primary goal is reducing the bandwidth spikes at relay time, though in many cases it also reduces propagation delay. It is automatically enabled between compatible peers. BIP 152
* As a side-effect, ordinary non-mining nodes will download and upload blocks faster if those blocks were produced by miners using similar transaction filtering policies. This means that a miner who produces a block with many transactions discouraged by your node will be relayed slower than one with only transactions already in your memory pool. The overall effect of such relay differences on the network may result in blocks which include widely- discouraged transactions losing a stale block race, and therefore miners may wish to configure their node to take common relay policies into consideration.
**Hierarchical Deterministic Key Generation**
* Newly created wallets will use hierarchical deterministic key generation according to BIP32 (keypath m/0’/0’/k’). Existing wallets will still use traditional key generation.
* Backups of HD wallets, regardless of when they have been created, can therefore be used to re-generate all possible private keys, even the ones which haven’t already been generated during the time of the backup. Attention: Encrypting the wallet will create a new seed which requires a new backup!
* Wallet dumps (created using the dumpwallet RPC) will contain the deterministic seed. This is expected to allow future versions to import the seed and all associated funds, but this is not yet implemented.
* HD key generation for new wallets can be disabled by -usehd=0. Keep in mind that this flag only has affect on newly created wallets. You can’t disable HD key generation once you have created a HD wallet.
* There is no distinction between internal (change) and external keys.
* HD wallets are incompatible with older versions of Bitcoin Core.
* Pull request, BIP 32
**Segregated Witness**
* The code preparations for Segregated Witness (“segwit”), as described in BIP 141, BIP 143, BIP 144, and BIP 145 are finished and included in this release. However, BIP 141 does not yet specify activation parameters on mainnet, and so this release does not support segwit use on mainnet. Testnet use is supported, and after BIP 141 is updated with proposed parameters, a future release of Bitcoin Core is expected that implements those parameters for mainnet.
* Furthermore, because segwit activation is not yet specified for mainnet, version 0.13.0 will behave similarly as other pre-segwit releases even after a future activation of BIP 141 on the network. Upgrading from 0.13.0 will be required in order to utilize segwit-related features on mainnet (such as signal BIP 141 activation, mine segwit blocks, fully validate segwit blocks, relay segwit blocks to other segwit nodes, and use segwit transactions in the wallet, etc).
* Mining transaction selection (“Child Pays For Parent”)
* The mining transaction selection algorithm has been replaced with an algorithm that selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed ancestor transactions. This means that a low-fee transaction can become more likely to be selected if a high-fee transaction that spends its outputs is relayed.
* With this change, the -blockminsize command line option has been removed.
* The command line option -blockmaxsize remains an option to specify the maximum number of serialized bytes in a generated block. In addition, the new command line option -blockmaxweight has been added, which specifies the maximum “block weight” of a generated block, as defined by [BIP 141 (Segregated Witness)] (
* In preparation for Segregated Witness, the mining algorithm has been modified to optimize transaction selection for a given block weight, rather than a given number of serialized bytes in a block. In this release, transaction selection is unaffected by this distinction (as BIP 141 activation is not supported on mainnet in this release, see above), but in future releases and after BIP 141 activation, these calculations would be expected to differ.
* For optimal runtime performance, miners using this release should specify -blockmaxweight on the command line, and not specify -blockmaxsize. Additionally (or only) specifying -blockmaxsize, or relying on default settings for both, may result in performance degradation, as the logic to support -blockmaxsize performs additional computation to ensure that constraint is met. (Note that for mainnet, in this release, the equivalent parameter for -blockmaxweight would be four times the desired -blockmaxsize. See [BIP 141] ( for additional details.)
* In the future, the -blockmaxsize option may be removed, as block creation is no longer optimized for this metric. Feedback is requested on whether to deprecate or keep this command line option in future releases.

The less miners that run a full node, the more centralized Bitcoin will become.

Why not propagate the block contents then the work (headers/coinbase)?
The "solution" of SPV mining for 20 seconds leaves some incentive issues. In simple terms, a miner is given 20 seconds to decide whether or not they want a block to count, and during this period the other miners assume it counts.
This means reorgs can be forced by delaying the release of the block contents until there is another fork chain created (since after all you can't impose a rule that restrict miners from releasing the block later than 20 seconds without permanent consensus splitting vulnerabilities). This makes selfish mining more efficient, because now during those 20 seconds you will have other miners assisting you in your selfish mining attack! This also allows much much easier disruption of consensus, which is a bigger problem IMO.
None of this is a problem if we broadcast the blocks then the work.

This is not a fair comparison. With miners fees being a significant (or in the future all) of their income, miners will not be able to decide individually how large blocks can be while maintaining a profit.
Creating a 100KB block costs almost the same as creating a 10MB block, however the revenues from a 10MB block would be approximately 100x as much as the 100KB block. Now, if all your competitors earning 100x the revenue you are for each unit of variable cost (a hash), then your business will not live for long.
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:44:55


Unless we die early, it will happen. We are already at about 7% of the block revenue being fees. With complete stagnation in Bitcoin that will result in 70% of block revenue being fees in 20 years. With the growth pattern we have seen, it will be even sooner.


Really, I'm fine with any configuration that allows Bitcoin to survive. Problem is that under conditions where blocks are on the order of 1GB/10m rather than 1MB/10m, large miners have a significant advantage, which is an incentive for miners to centralize.

But they aren't perfectly aligned, for example it is in the users interests to have a secure network and have all mining pools validate, however centralizing pressures, specifically block size, [led to a certain chinese mining pool not validating blocks, which led to a large (6 block) network fork.]( It also is in users interest to have every miner fully validate, however the costs of full validation applied to the miners cost/benefit analysis often makes full validation not in their interests, and they outsource validation to their pool.
We have also seen large miners use their hash power to steal from businesses (finney attack), another action that demonstrates a clear misalignment of incentives between miners and users. This theft wouldn't have been possible if the miner (GHash) wasn't large at the time. In other words, if the system didn't have incentives in place for miners to become large at the time, this misalignment of incentives wouldn't have even been an issue.


The white paper doesn't even mention hard forks, I have no idea what you're talking about.

It would also be cool if you could have a trustless exchange between currencies, i.e. if we agree to trade 1 btc for 5 foocoin, that would be traded with no risk of either of us running off with the others money.

Yes, that is very different. Your measure of "90% of hash power comes from centralized miners" is pointless. By that metric one 90% miner is the same as 100 0.9% miners, which are very different. Like I said, you are having trouble understanding what the problem with centralized mining is. Larger miners can harm the network more cheaply, and larger miners can use their economies of scale to help centralization and themselves.
The problem isn't some black and white "it's centralized" vs "it's not centralized". It's a system that gets less and less safe as it becomes more and more centralized.
Stop saying "it's centralized therefore it can't become any more centralized", that is only true with a 100% miner. It is completely useless. You are simplifying the issue and drawing arbitrary lines to the point that you are right in your hypothetical system that is not Bitcoin, but what you are saying doesn't apply to Bitcoin.

**My incomplete summary of problems with large blocks.**
Goal of Bitcoin:
* What software should the core developers make available? If I were to dictate to the developers what they should do I would ask first that they not violate the security of Bitcoin. An important component of Bitcoin is trustlessness, without it, we might as well drop the blockchain and pick up a more efficient system. There are other goals one might have like "does this keep Bitcoin cheap" or "is this what Satoshi said he wanted", however I don't see the point of achieving these goals if loss of trustlessness is the cost.
General mining situation:
* So does increasing the blocksize put trustlessness in jeopardy? Like most things in security it isn't black and white. The mining ecosystem becomes less secure and more centralized when there is a larger network load. It is a reaction that is caused by the cost of supporting the networks security becoming greater than its benefits. For example, every mining pool member could effectively take the control back from the pool and generate their own blocks, causing a huge decrease in the trust we are required to put in these pools. There is, however, a cost to these individual miners running a full node including additional latency for the pool users, additional resources for the pool if they are using the relay network, and many many other factors that increase as the block size increases.
Benefits to big miners:
* This isn't limited to individual miners in pools either, a certain Chinese mining pool was not validating blocks due to the stales that would be caused, though this can be improved partially with IBLT. The cause of the pool not validating was that their geographic separation from other mining pools made it more expensive to mine fully validating. It actually is very efficient to have all your miners in a geographically centralized area, like a single warehouse, and it becomes even more efficient as the network load increases. In general, as blocks become bigger there is a centralizing effect to the mining ecosystem and that causes the requirement of trust, the antithesis of Bitcoin.
Getting small miners to run full nodes:
* I usually get responses like "These miners can afford to run full nodes", but the question isn't whether they can run full nodes, it is whether they will! At what point does a miner benefit from a full node? A 0.1% miner may realize that the expenses of running a full node cut into their profits by 5%, and then through a rough estimate realize that their 0.1% of hash power belonging to a large mining pool doesn't harm the network, and by extension them that much. This leads to them not running a full node. The minimal hash power required for "profitable" validation varies based on factors including the loss of profit through latency caused by geographic placement, the gain in personal "profit" through the enjoyment that comes from running a full node as a hobby. However, as a general trend, the minimal hash power someone will run a full node at decreases and the cost of a full node increases.
Decreasing attack cost with higher network load: 
* At this point, this economy of scale induced effect has led to miners being massive, the largest two miners individually can both reverse a confirmation with 40% probability of success. Combined, they can reverse 6 confirmations with 75% success. This is quite dangerous considering that a single government may attack Bitcoin relatively cheaply, or a profit-seeking miner may decide to attack as we have seen before with the 3000BTC GHash.io theft.
Increasing attack benefit with higher network load:
* One of the main differences between a miner attacking an SPV-using merchant and a full-node-using merchant is the ability to forge money out of thin air that can't be spent in a reorg. If you, an economical and malicious miner, want to rip off a merchant running a full node, you need to send them YOUR (or your partners) money and **then** spend your hashing power (money) attempting to steal their money. When you rip off a merchant running an SPV node, you can create money out of thin air, create invalid blocks, then be guaranteed that your payment will be reversed. There is no up front cost other than the electricity of your mine and you can block withhold to make your attack much more likely to succeed than the reorg attack mentioned in the full node example. In short, many SPV nodes make miner attacks much more profitable and likely to succeed. But it's not like full nodes don't have to be worried, they too can be caught up in the attack because including a full node target in the attack doesn't cost additional mining resources. The number of full nodes online doesn't matter nearly as much as the number and fraction of merchants validating payments with full nodes.
* We must consider this centralizing effect caused by large blocks and work towards making mining decentralized and the ecosystem safer by reducing the system load. This can be accomplished by having the blocksize increase at a rate lower than the rate at which hardware and software changes decrease the expenses caused by block size.

Okay, that answers my first question, but I still don't understand why that is a problem if we upgrade slowly. If low fees are a problem with large blocks now, they will be a problem with large blocks if we increase the blocksize after establishing a fee market.

As it is commonly used today, yes. Just a nitpick, pooled mining doesn't need to be trust based in the same sense that it commonly is today.
It is ideal to minimize trust. If we have one pool whose validation is trusted by many other pools and this pool trust tree has a large portion of the hashrate, we have a serious problem.

Namecoin isn't called an altcoin due to it not sharing a genesis block, it is an altcoin because its currency isn't compatible with Bitcoins. You are just assuming that one of the many properties separating them is the sole reason it is an altcoin. It has different rules, a different genesis block, unequal/unpegged currency units, a different mining algorithm, etc.
I outlined the entire problem with your definition in the last post. The only difference by your definition is that the first block has to have the bitcoin genesis block hash in it. This is completely useless and doesn't have any implications about how the currency acts. It's just a piece of data in the first block that doesn't even have to be seen by the currencies users.

If proof of work could do something for humanity that would be wonderful. The purpose for PoW is to make it increasingly costly to reverse blocks through expending a scarce resource (electricity) to construct a compact proof of work. The proof of work in itself only requires 80 bytes and anyone can verify it with no trust to anyone else.
Things like serving pages don't have a proof. They require trust in someone serving a page to be honest about serving. And if you could construct a proof there may be an economy of scale in web page serving, or you may be able to optimize it and make it so you can do it much more efficiently than everyone else.
In other words some requirements for a secure PoW are
1) Progress free
2) Easy to verify
3) Not easy to find new optimizations
4) Doesn't have an economy of scale for some other reason

Contentious doesn't have anything to do with the number of people not having upgraded, but having strong justified disagreement.


There isn't really a way to simulate economics like that without throwing a ton of assumption into it.
We can look into Metcalfe's law and see that the network effect is damaged by people using different Bitcoins.
We can look into fake confirmation attacks and see that one side of the fork will have incredible risk and understand that we should minimize the stake of the minority fork. In other words, a 99% / 1% fork is much much better than a 90% / 10% fork because it leaves 1% vs 10% of the network vulnerable to fake confirmation attacks and service interruptions.
One very important objection is the stupidity of the upgrade mechanism. 75% of mining power does not a fork make. We had 95% miner votes and that still wasn't sufficient. We had 6 fake confirmations ON ACCIDENT with 95%. We cannot risk 75%, 95% is still relatively unsafe in todays mining ecosystem. Also, 75% measures the MINERS, not the stake holders. It is very possible that, as it has been with almost every upgrade, 75% of miners upgrade before most full nodes and stake holders. What does this mean? A portion of the miners are mining fools gold not accepted by the merchants, they possibly move back mining with the 1MB rule, there is uncertainly, instability, confirmations are meaningless until this is sorted out, many are at risk of losing money.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:51:32
Yes, our 1MB is problematic too. An ideal block size cap would be decreased. We likely can't multiply the network load by 20 safely.

@_date: 2015-08-12 15:06:43
Yes, more easily than a blockchain. A blockchain isn't some perfect datastructure for storing transactions, it is a great datastructure for distsributed consensus. When you take away the distributed consensus it is lousy. Imagine if you bought a semi-truck (blockchain) which is designed for hauling large loads and imagine you had no knowledge of sports cars (relational databases). You thought "wow, this truck can go pretty fast, I should add another engine, and sell it as a race car". You suggest this to an auto manufacturer and they say "we already have a better design for fast cars". You smirk proudly and say "but can your sports car go 110MPH?".

Pieters response:


If miners need to form alliances of trusting each other's blocks without validation to overcome the inefficiencies of slow block propagation, I think we have a system that is in direct conflict with the word "permissionless" that you use later.
 


Specialization is perfectly fine.








I find it interesting to build a system that has potential to bring about innovation.


That is not true, I'm sorry if that is the impression I gave.
I see centralization and scalability as a trade-off, and for better or for worse, the block chain only offers one trade-off. I want to see technology built on top that introduces lower levels of trust than typical fully centralized systems, while offering increased convenience, speed, reliability, and scale. I just don't think that all of that can happen on the lowest layer without hurting everything built on top. We need different trade-offs, and the blockchain is just one, but a very fundamental one.


That sounds amazing, but do you think that Bitcoin, as it exists today, can scale to hundreds of millions of users, while retaining any glimpse of permission-lessness and decentralization? I think we need low-trust off-chain systems and other innovations to make that happen.

Number of nodes has never been a perfect metric for the will of the people. It has always been capable of sybil manipulation. It is **especially** useless (or even harmful) when multiple nodes are being run by one person (sybil attack) or are being run on a cloud host.

The problem is that you want to put unnecessary expenses on miners in a perfect competition causing an economy of scale and centralization.
@_date: 2015-08-07 11:55:31


I didn't say it's useless, just much less useful. Providing a full node essentially allows others to validate blocks you propagate to them, which they can already do without need to support your full node/being supported by your full node.
Low node count is a problem indirectly because it means less people are actually validating their payments and they are giving trust to miners. When many people trust miners and have SPV security it gives miners more profitable attack scenarios and harms the network as a whole.
Low node count is mostly just an indicator for something else: difficulty in running a full node. The more difficult a full node is to run, the less miners will run one. The less miners who run one, the more centralized the Bitcoin mining network is. The more centralized the mining network is, the cheaper an attack becomes.
This isn't to say that full node costs are the only reason large blocks lead to centralization. I wrote a bit more about it here: 


Trivial in that you can send thousands of people spam that they will spend lots and lots of computational resources on processing, disrupting the Bitcoin network, for a one time cost of $10k.


The one I assume you're referring to isn't really viable in V0.11, but do you really think the fact that a spam attack vector existed is a good justification for introducing new, worse, attack vectors?


Trivial and expensive are opposites. I'm not really sure what you're talking about anyways, you haven't explained which spam attack you're referring to, but there aren't any known spam attacks that are preventable exclusively through larger blocks AFAIK.

1) [Many employees including Gregory have acknowledged that a blocksize increase may be problematic and isn't necessarily the plan since before blockstream was founded in 2014](


--gmaxwell, 2011
2) This is simply wrong. There are core developers who don't work for blockstream that are against a block size increase. Peter Todd being the most famous of the bunch. And, funny enough, the Core Maintainer, Wladimir van der Laan, an employee of the Bitcoin Foundation (which you are representing right now) appears to be against the block size increase from what I've read from him.
3) Blockstream has many (or all) employees against the block size increase BECAUSE they are the company developing the infrastructure that is an alternative to a block size increase. If you are against the block size increase it makes sense to solve the problems associated with scalability given a constant block size. If you're going to do that you might as well get paid by the largest company paying people to build these tools, Blockstream.

If these hashers pointing at a pool could obtain the information necessary to determine that their pool was attacking, then this problem wouldn't exist in the first place.
The thing is, individual miners aren't guaranteed to be able to obtain that information and validate blocks if the blocks are large and mining isn't a profitable decision.

I just explained why that's wrong. If you're not going to discuss logic and will just blindly argue by assertion there is no point in discussing this.


Indeed, and keeping Bitcoin from being centralized is profitable. If you're going to ignore the harm of centralization that and assume Bitcoin will immediately gravitate to the most efficient state regardless of the harm of centralization, then we would be at a point where one centralized pool was at 100% already, since that is the most profitable way to mine WHEN YOU IGNORE CENTRALIZATION.
It is so sad that people want to further centralize Bitcoin with the argument "Bitcoin is centralized".

The 2nd image is silly.
1) Bitcoin has never been defined by purely the tallest blockchain. Perhaps there is Minercoin or Unvalidatedcoin where the tallest blockchain, regardless of the rules, is the correct blockchain. However this is Bitcoin, where a block produced by a miner must follow a set of rules, he can't create 10 million bitcoins out of thin air, he can't spend others funds, and he can't break other Bitcoin validation rules.
2) The definition is broken. Litecoin could easily be considered Bitcoin by this definition if the genesis litecoin block simply had the Bitcoin genesis blockhash in it. The genesis block doesn't really mean much in distinguishing altcoins from Bitcoins, and you certainly can have two alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that don't have consensus that share a genesis block.
3) It seems this definition was just made up to make it appear as if a certain altcoin, that has gotten a lot of attention lately, was Bitcoin.
The definition of altcoin is alternative cryptocurrency and luke-jr's image explains how forks can (or do not in the case of consensus maintaining forks) make alternative cryptocurrencies well.

It has very similar trust properties to the blockchain, I don't see why it is incredibly important to have your transaction redundantly processed by thousands of computers.

The definition of altcoin is alternative cryptocurrency. When does a currency stop being the same currency?
The definitions thrown around have been basically "a currency that at some point had the same blockchain" or "a currency that will have consensus temporarily" but these definitions don't make any sense. Ethereum could easily have been "Bitcoin" simply by having a client that accepted the Bitcoin rules until a week from now when it forked the blockchain, and used a new ruleset that erased everyones holdings and distributed all the etherercoins.
Clearly that wouldn't be Bitcoin, and that is why the definition cannot be as simple as "it used the same blockchain" or "it validates the same rules as Bitcoin in the short term". If it is planning on forking and breaking consensus from the current Bitcoin and there isn't consensus within the current Bitcoin community, it is possible it could fit within many logical definitions for altcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:58:34

Forcing people to upgrade requires resources. In a short period they have to gain the knowledge about the upgrade, determine whether they approve of the contents of the upgrade and download the software. Anyone who doesn't upgrade will be on an old fork. Likely, anyone who doesn't want to deal with keeping track of that like.. an average person running a business will use third parties to upgrade for them, or just use trusted third parties to run validating nodes for them.
There's also is the problem of reviewing the code, making sure there is consensus, etc. If you don't have time to review the code, Bitcoin becomes vulnerable to attackers hiding nasty stuff in the consensus code. If you don't make sure you have consensus you likely will end up trying to figure out what some authority (Gavin) is doing to determine whether to upgrade, centralizing Bitcoin.

The most basic form of a full node that doesn't relay blocks, transactions or anything else only benefits the network through the fact that they are using the network in a safe way. They also are decreasing incentives for a miner to attack by auditing blocks produced by them rather than blondly accepting them.
That full node can benefit the network in a few ways from there, they can
* Relay the blocks and transaction allowing other nodes to gain the same benefit.
* Give SPV proofs to SPV wallets.
* Mine, this is a big one, a full node miner benefits everyone by making the mining network less vulnerable.

1) This 75% is NOT stake holders, it is not nodes, it is miners. The stake holders or full nodes could still be 70% on the 1MB chain. This would lead to, more likely, miners downgrading and the 30% with the new rules having fake confs and being vulnerable to theft, or the 70% being vulnerable to fake confs. It all would depend on which changes first, the miners to 1MB-ruleset or the full nodes and stake holders to the &gt;1MB-ruleset. This leaves us with instability and uncertainty during this time. This is the incredibly dangerous result of a contentious hard fork.
2) Even if it was 75% of stake holders, that is very dangerous, 25% of full nodes or 25% of stake recognizing a different blockchain means 25% (or 75% depending who changes) is vulnerable to fake conf attacks. 
In this scenario 100% of the merchants accept the 1MB rules while only 75% accept the &gt;1MB rules. With the 0.7-0.8 fork we downgraded because it was the smart thing to do, I could see the same thing happening again.
3) Miners don't have to follow their votes. As we saw with the most recent softfork, 95% wasn't even perfectly safe. We ended up with ~55% of the network actually accepting the rules they voted for, ~40% weren't using the rules they voted for. Large miners actually have an incentive to vote for the &gt;1MB rules and switch back because it essentially creates a softfork back to 1MB-ruleset scenario where a large portion of the miners are mining invalid blocks and they profit from the lesser competition.

At this point it's basically a waste of time. A Bitcoin security expert may bill for $100-$300/hour to review a cryptosystem, however an amateur cryptographer may bill for $15/hour. You can't expect someone to waste their time reviewing ALL these systems that are poorly defined and hacked together.
You are of course free to pay someone to review its security, but at this point there isn't any reason for them to do it for free since, being security experts, they understand that the system isn't going to be promising.

Naturally, about 2% of blocks stale. At the same time, the set of transactions that different pools will accept to memory pool isn't equal. This means that there are quite a few opportunities to create a transaction that gets confirmed, has an organic reorg, then broadcast a doublespend that will be accepted by another pool that didn't accept your first transaction to the mempool during reorg.
Essentially this gives you the ability to doublespend a confirmed transaction without the help of a pool. Has this happened? Tough to say, not everyone has a copy of every fork.

Roughly speaking, it is the majority of Bitcoin merchants weighted by volume of sales using bitcoin.
A bitcoin holder isn't going to care about a chain on which only a small pizza place accepts their coins. A miner isn't going to be able to redeem their bitcoin in any useful way on that chain either.
Even if 90% of miners agree that bitcoin should work some way, their opinion doesn't matter if they're mining fools gold which no one will accept.
This should give some intuition for what the economic majority is, and why it guides what happens in bitcoin.
As an aside, there are some interesting proposals for allowing users to vote based on coin-days-destroyed. This is a rough approximation of the economic majority as well.

No, it is well understood that an additional cost to mining leads to a smaller portion of miners full node mining.


Block size isn't the only variable. Bitcoin core has been optomized quite a bit and with the latest version download time is significantly lower.

That doesn't really matter, I don't see why this is repeated everywhere. If you want the requirements for 1MB blocks, bandwidth meeting the requirements for 400KB blocks isn't sufficient.

One thing you have to be careful with is the fact that a larger network is only more valuable if all the other characteristics stay constant. For example, if the network doubled in size, but transactions started taking a week to confirm, that would be bad. That is just an example, not necessarily a likely scenario.
The characteristic that many are concerned with, with regards to increasing the block size, is trust. IMHO, Bitcoin is more useful with 100K users and little trust required in the miners than a billion users and absolute trust required in a single miner that they won't attack or steal.
This post isn't an explanation of why the block size increase may cause centralization, rather, it is a post explaining that userbase isn't the only factor when determining the usefulness of the network (though it is an important one).
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:53:55
You say they will and have an incentive to, but they already aren't due to the block size.
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:56:41

@_date: 2015-07-24 16:39:30
Ignoring my opposition to &gt;1MB blocks, "ensuring your client supports at least any block size larger than 1MB" is dangerous and stupid. You open yourself up to fake confirmation attacks and there are much safer ways to do it, namely ensuring that a supermajority of miners also agree to &gt;1MB blocks.
Edit: It is quite funny how security implications seem to be universally ignored by big-blockers even when it isn't contradicting their goal of big blocks. At first I thought the security implications were ignored due to cognitive dissonance, but perhaps the security implications are completely impossible to understand for these people since they don't have sufficient Bitcoin understanding.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:03:44


Perhaps a 3000BTC transaction they want to reverse? You may think that a miner wouldn't attempt due to the damage to the Bitcoin network, but GHash stole 3000BTC from a gambling website using their hash power. A few months following that, they became the largest mining pool in Bitcoin history and hit &gt;51%.
At a certain point you have to wonder what the distinction is between the question "What confirmation was so valuable that collapsing the [Bitcoin] market was worth it" and "what payment reversal and abuse was so valuable that the central authority behind the hypothetical centralized altcoin CentralCoin would abuse his own system". IMO, if you have to trust one individual, or a small number of individuals to not destroy the system, Bitcoin isn't in a good place.


Firstly we need miners to run full nodes. In a pure economic sense ignoring advertising and such, this can be accomplished by lowering the cost of a full node. The cost of a full node can be lowered by waiting for cheaper hardware, or Bitcoin Core software optimizations combined with a manageable network load/block size.
Second, we need these miners to actually utilize their full nodes. It is absolutely fine if we have large mining pools if those mining pools have tools to decentralize their hash power back to the actual miners. These tools include GBT and P2Pool. Theoretically, Eligius could have 60% or so of the hash power mining in their pool and the network be perfectly healthy, because they can't do anything with the hash power in terms of attacking the network.


I'm not quite sure why these miners wouldn't be running in pools, and this is a bit unrelated to the last question. Bitcoin hash power being distributed between hundreds of millions of households with toaster ASICS, oven ASICS, heater ASICS would be a fantastic outcome. It would mean that tens of millions of people would need to collude to attack the network (basically the polar opposite of today).
I think a more useful measurement is electricity expended rather than hashrate since the efficiency of equipment is changing all the time. Essentially, an attack that forces reorgs using 5% of the network hashrate may cost the same as the electric costs of 1% of the worlds toasters, ovens and heaters.

~~however, the likely scenario is he fucked up big time and made his script hash the same as another transactions script hash. This means he has to find a script that hashes to that value and returns true, which is basically impossible.~~

Peter Todd's tree chains, as they were described in his mailing list post don't deal with different consensus  rules (though there may be some clever way to allow some sidechain equivalent that I don't know of).

reason: from the network’s perspective, the purpose of mining is to secure the currency, but
from the miner’s perspective, the purpose of mining is to gain the block reward. These two
motivations complement each other, since a block reward is worth more in a secure currency
than in a sham one, so the miner is incentivized to secure the network rather than attacking it.
However, if the miner is motivated not by the block reward, but by some social or scientific
purpose related to the proof-of-work evaluation, then these incentives are no longer aligned
(and may in fact be opposed, if the miner wants to discourage others from encroaching on his
work), weakening the security of the network.

Yes, as I mentioned in another post, this paper is uninteresting. It provides a very very very limited and a very dumb attack model. In their attack model, the attacker for some reason needs to broadcast two transactions to the network immediately, something completely unnecessary for a NaS attack and then we can track the accounts somehow and deduct funds from them because we assume that the attacker decides to hold stake in the currency. It isn't that NaS is wrong, it's that a very dumb attacker will fail. AND we must invoke trust to bring everyone to consensus in their model.
TL;DR: Terrible paper written by someone trying to push PoS by creating a "straw"-NaS model that involves an attacker performing dumb, unnecessary actions that allow him to be penalized.

The bitcoin network could also process 10x as much through reducing the security parameters of signatures and public keys by an order of magnitude.

Despite the fact that redditors love to repeat this meme to each other, there actually are mounds of evidence that large blocks have a centralizing effect. The history of mining pools and miners, how incentives work and economic theory, the fact that a greater full node load leads to lower likeleyhood of running full nodes...
The funny thing is this thoughtless garbage always gets pushed to the top. Yes, let's ignore the evidence and combine all of reddits genius ideas into one altcoin. Inconsistently validate between clients and even between miners, allow fake conf attacks, everyone is SPV, massive blocks, there will always be one central authority to process them for us after all, and lets not forget to reimplement consensus 50 different ways. Because we're le reddit, we know what is best for bitcoin and it's neither decentralization nor consensus.

I'm confused, of course if you don't need some form of security (proper validation) then you aren't going to be effected by not having that form of security.


This isn't how security works. You can easily create a vulnerable system that hasn't been attacked *yet*.


Absolutely, this is the correct question to be asking. I'll give you a scenario here.
Mr 1% Miner knows that "GambleCoin", a bitcoin dice website, is using a client that accepts &gt;1MB blocks, however &lt;50% of miners accept &gt;1MB blocks. GambleCoin also happens to accept 1 confirmation before payment. Mr 1% Miner usually makes ~25BTC one average once every 100 blocks, now he is interested in attacking due to his greed. He asks GambleCoin for a payment address and starts mining 1.1MB blocks including a transaction paying 500BTC to that address. Eventually he creates a "fake conf" block that appears valid to GambleCoin and 50% of the time he wins.
This time he happens to win and he rebroadcasts his transaction paying 500BTC to GambleCoin and GambleCoins payment of 1000BTC to him to the rest of the network so it ends up in the actual mainchain. Mr 1% Miners block is reorged out and he is left with a gain of 500BTC and a loss of 25BTC, for a total profit of 475BTC.
Next block he loses and instead rebroadcasts a new doublespend transaction to the main network, while GambleCoin sits and happily enjoys their 500BTC payment in the fake conf block. Unfortunate for GambleCoin, when this confirmation is removed and the 1.1MB block reorged out, GambleCoin is left without the payment. Mr 1% Miner loses no Bitcoins from the bet, but loses 25BTC in block reward, for a total loss of 25BTC.
Every iteration of this has an E[X] of (475 + (-25))/2 = 225BTC. This attacker is able to earn 225BTC every 100 blocks rather than 25BTC every block, and that is only assuming he uses 500BTC each try, if he has more BTC he can earn more.

I mean not requiring trust.


No, what the fuck does the hardware the blockchain is validated on have to do with this?


No it doesn't it means not trust-invoking.


To an extent yes, but the bigger concern is SPV mining which already is a huge problem.


Mostly the mining network being decentralized and therefore trustless.


Interesting that you bring up an argument supporting the "this is what Bitcoin was meant to be" crowd, when I made no mention of that sort, then later complain about that crowd.
The ONLY people I have ever seen quote satoshi and take his word as gospel are members of the block size increase crowd. Perhaps they are all like you and imagining some straw-opponent that is arguing for keeping bitcoin as satoshi wanted it, then having a lightbulb light up and thinking "Hey, this thing I imagined my opponent arguing is wrong, and satoshi said something different!".

It isn't helping right now because we haven't hit it. Once we hit it, it will help limit the centralizing effect though.


Indeed, we would be much healthier if validating were cheaper. To accomplish this, we need optimizations and decreases in load.

It would be unfortunate if the developers wrote the code and gave users the option to harm their security. We could have a softfork requiring that sha256  no longer be used, and instead be replaced with some hash function having broken security. It CAN be technically achieved, it just is dishonest for cryptography experts to give this option to users and promote it.

Firstly, miners votes don't always correspond to miners actions. With our most recent fork, 95% of miners "voted" for the change, but only a little more than 50% enforced the change. A miner could strategically vote for the change, then move back to the old fork and profit from other miners mining fools gold.
They also could just not know that something like 5%-25% of merchants haven't upgraded yet and decide to emergency softfork back down to the original version that 100% of merchants accept.
So yes, when a fork has no contention it will be safe for miners to upgrade, though a fork should still have a 95% requirement.

One of the main reasons for going safer scaling routes is the fear of miner centralization. Because Bitcoin and Bcash share a POW algorithm, Bitcoin absorbs the externalities of Bcash centralizing the miners. Also, having miners split between two different currencies results in a less safe network. Another externality is that Bcash provides incentive for holders to disrupt technical discussion and spread FUD about Bitcoin, as we have seen for the past few years.
If Bcash had none of these externalities, I would have no problem with its existence. I would be fine with it's existence if they just went their own way, didn't reduce the signal-to-noise ratio substantially in order to disrupt technical discussion, and didn't share a PoW algorithm.

The risk with miner centralization isn't that small numbers are spooky, it's that the entire Bitcoin ecosystem depends on decentralized mining. The Bitcoin ecosystem doesn't care if a handful of entities are making 51% of transactions.

I agree the block limit can follow the dropping cost of a full node which is caused by full nodes, however 1MB is likely already too high given the dangerous mining ecosystem.
I'm not sure how a larger block size would disrupt the 4-5 giant pools other than by turning them into maybe 2-3.


They can, but I also can run 50000 XT fake nodes for a relatively low cost (I would only need to actually validate on one).

Consensus converges over time assuming miners follow the rules they voted for. This would be the case for XT as well if the goal was to have no miners using XT, then XT users would just be vulnerable to fake conf attacks. However the goal is to break consensus, the opposite of the goal in BIP66.

F2Pool has decided to not validate blocks. This is because the latency involved in validating large blocks causes them to spend less time mining the top block and more time validating new blocks. They have decided to only check the block header and mine on top of the difficulty-wise longest blockchain (in other words SPV mining).
As the block size increases, we can expect to see less validation due to increased costs and latency.
It is quite funny/sad that F2Pool signed a document saying they could handle 8MB blocks when it is quite clear that they aren't willing to handle 500kb blocks.
There are a variety of solutions. The PoW could be made impossible for nodes that aren't fully validating, these pools could actually switch to mining on top of the tallest valid blockchain rather than the tallest blockchain after a block has been validated with some software changes, or we could just restrict the blocksize until technology catches up and makes the current blocksize feasible.

2) This is simply wrong. There are core developers who don't work for blockstream that are against a block size increase. Peter Todd being the most famous of the bunch. And, funny enough, the Core Maintainer, Wladimir van der Laan, an employee of the Bitcoin Foundation (which you are representing right now) appears to be against the block size increase from what I've read from him.
3) Blockstream has many (or all) employees against the block size increase BECAUSE they are the company developing the infrastructure that is an alternative to a block size increase. If you are against the block size increase it makes sense to solve the problems associated with scalability given a constant block size. If you're going to do that you might as well get paid by the largest company paying people to build these tools, Blockstream.

Wallets are already decentralized, you don't need to use a web wallet. You can reduce your exposure on an exchange and decentralization doesn't really help with exposure so I'm not concerned with that.
Consensus rules are rules, they're not centralized or decentralized. All clients should have the same consensus rules and it is a threat for clients to not have the same rules.
What really matters is miner decentralization, which has been harmed by block size increases and can be improved as technology becomes cheaper and the blocksize stays the same.

Not least? I assume you are trying to say they use pools to reduce variance? This is true, but I was talking about outsourcing block creation, which is unrelated.

You don't necessarily need a server admin, just a computer and software that doesn't crash, the same as if you outsourced block creation.

My point is that something "artificial" in Bitcoin isn't a bad thing. The all the security components of the system are man-made/artificial. The security includes an artificial block size limit. Simply stating it is artificial isn't sufficient (however I'm not claiming your only argument is that it is artificial).
The caution in preventing block size bloat is a security caution, it has the negative effect of increasing fees however. I believe Bitcoin can survive with 10GB blocks today, but it would be centralized and require trust. The reason Bitcoin exists is to provide a trustless money solution.
I don't mind fees being higher while scalability solutions are being developed since it is necessary to achieve decentralization. Immediate mass adoption is pointless if it means the system is no longer trustless. If we don't mind invoking trust, we might as well use a more efficient currency, but Bitcoin should remain trustless.

25% don't even need to make a concerted effort, by default their software will reverse a confirmation more often than it will not. This alone isn't as risky as the fact that there is plenty of room for the mining ecosystem to change in the two weeks after 75% is hit, be it organically or through an attack (that could easily double the profits of a 20% miner).

I disagree, with decreasing costs in computational resources and software optimizations, I believe we can move away from centralization and create a healthy, thriving Bitcoin ecosystem. Once we have scalability tools that don't harm trustlessness like Lightning, we can even increase the transaction load.
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:52:51


Sure, I can agree with that, but it is beyond ridiculous for to be claiming that the reason there is conflict between the two sides is that the developers either don't understand the benefits of a block size increase, or have an ulterior motive. The reason is simply for the reason that they believe the negatives of a blocksize increase outweigh the positives.
I am not a developer and I agree with them. I get basically no gain from Blockstreams success (except core developers get funded which is good for the security of my money). Preventing blocksize bload benefits me because the negatives won't cause devaluation of my bitcoins, but more importantly, because I think Bitcoin is an important political tool and an incredibly interesting technology that I want to see thrive.

The one that set our current 1MB blocksize limit.


They SPV mined because they determined that 500kb blocks cause too much latency to validate before mining. If they're going to validate blocks they might as well validate them all. Validating after the fact only guarantees that they will not produce a long chain of invalid blocks (and doesn't contribute to network security). It doesn't prevent them from extending an invalid chain by one.
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:25:44
Yes I do.
Lower network load causes individual miners to full node mine.
Individual miners full node mining causes large centralized mining entities to have less power.
Large centralized mining entities having less power causes decentralization.
Though this isn't the only proof, just one proof among many.
@_date: 2015-07-24 21:38:57
There are ways to do this that don't increase the full node load. The reason transactions need to be recorded by full nodes is so they can keep consensus. Storage of this data is possible because full nodes are forced to it.  You can however prove that the data was committed using merged mining.

The 1MB limit was placed by miners, not core devs, however there are a lot of artificial components to Bitcoin. There is the artificial limitation on the type of signature you can have, the artificial limitation on the miner subsidy at 25BTC (for now), the artificial requirement for blocks to be valid to be considered to be in the main blockchain.
Bitcoin is made by humans, so any component of it will be artificial including the security rules that prevent systemic failure. These security rules include preventing users from spending coins that they don't have the private key to redeem, preventing miners from creating as many coins as they want and restricting the block size.
There probably could be an altcoin with none of these rules, but artificial security rules are inherently necessary for a secure cryptocurrency to survive.

Limiting others from doing harmful things is required in Bitcoin. If you want you can make an altcoin with no rules and see how that turns out.

centralized payment processor transaction cost: cost of bandwidth used for communicating from merchant to processor. Cost of storing a few bytes, cost of a few microseconds on a single CPU.
Bitcoin transaction cost: cost of relaying transaction between all mining nodes, cost of revenue lost through stales which are caused by additional latency from larger block size caused by additional transactions, cost of proving that you have expended the most scarce resource in the universe in order to secure the network, cost of a massive collection of full nodes redundantly validating the same transactions and blocks, etc.

Every running bitcoin node is in consensus on the rule that 1MB blocks will be the limit forever. You can increase that, but it requires changing consensus. You are being intellectually dishonest by stretching "consensus", which has a very clear meaning in Bitcoin, to mean something else.

This is wrong, it makes many attacks significantly more expensive, namely attacks that force large reorgs.
Your entire post seems to be assuming the one and only possible type of attack on the Bitcoin network is a spam attack.
Do you think you're the first one to realize that there is no limit on the mempool size? Do you think that was a little detail that everyone overlooked? Because it's not. The block size issue isn't solved just because the network was able to handle a high transaction rate IN MEMPOOL NOT BLOCK, for a few hours.


Hey, I tested trying to spend someones Bitcoins. I tried generating a bunch of hashes and only was able to generate 2^50 when there are 2^160 possible.

No I'm not. They're using a system they agreed to. If they want to generate invalid blocks they are free to, I'm not going to recognize them and neither is any other full node.


It isn't central planning, it is decentralized planning, every full node agrees to these rules. The rules including the blocksize limit, the requirement of blocks to have sufficient work done, the requirement of miners to not reward themselves with billions of bitcoins printed out of thin air are all part of this planning. Once again, you are free to make your own failed altcoin that lets miners spend others Bitcoins, generate Bitcoins from thin air, or removes any other "planning" (security rule).

Satoshi also originally put OP_HASH160 and OP_EQUAL for the reason of simple hashing and equality checking, but they were found to be useful for other reasons.

It is a bit like me showing you the source code of the software running on my raspberry pi then you saying "okay, this is fine, I will now give you all my Bitcoin private keys" I later could go home and the software running with software that steals your funds.

They sure can acknowledge that Satoshi had an idea for Bitcoins direction when there was virtually no research in the field. I don't see what a developers statement that is 6 years behind in research has to do with anything though. This isn't satoshicoin and his word isn't gospel, though perhaps we should hardfork out pay to script hash since it's clear by his original script design that OP_HASH160 and OP_EQUAL are supposed to do two things completely separate from what they do today.

Yes you're right, I should be more specific. Miner decentralization is my biggest concern since it is the form of decentralization that is most threatened right now.

75% is TERRIBLE. We had a fork that 95% of miners "agreed" to, and only ~55% of miners actually committed. Fortunately, that was a soft fork which meant that eventually the 55% won (and that was after certain miners stopping mining).
A 75% of hash power requirement in a hardfork scenario will almost certainly lead to terrible instability. The 25% of miners (or perhaps 40% or more if there are still lots of SPV miners) will be able to reverse many blocks with high probability, while the 75% (or perhaps 60% or less w/ SPV) will be risking a lot of money every second they mine on the large-block blockchain.
Enough of these losses may lead to miners making the emergency decision of switching back to the old network rules, which would cause big-block miners to be putting even *more* money at risk, leading to even more miners switching back eventually establishing the old rules as once again the true rules.
That is only the possible natural effect, 75% opens up a whole can of worms and makes the large pools, which coincidentally are being considered to not be problems and ignored to the result of larger blocks, able to perform many attacks that take wealth from other miners and disrupt the ecosystem.

Perhaps you should look into block withholding attacks.

How do we measure down time? Blocks are produced discretely, so we can't really use them alone.
Single confirmations work only ~98% of the time naturally. Perhaps the best measure is how often your transaction can be safely accepted with 6 confirmations?

The blockchain has fundamental limitations beyond not being spam resistant. Namely requiring more trust as the network load (proportional to block size) increases.

Yes, if you remove the limit there would likely be a maximum average blocksize that appears, it may be 1MB, it may be 10MB, it may be 50MB. I agree that there will be a maximum blocksize that appears based on speed of light and processing speed constraints.
This however DOES NOT suggest we don't need an explicit block size limit. The block size limits function today is to keep the network safe and keep mining decentralized for the most part. For our current 500KB blocks we had 40% of the mining network not even validating blocks. Two mining pools can collude to reverse 6 confirmations. The mining ecosystem is dangerously unhealthy because of validation costs and latency from validation.
This seems to be someone who has a good idea and good math, but in the end OP forces his idea into his conclusion. I agree that a rough blocksize limit would arise from physical limitations, I agree with his conclusion A, however OP says that we don't need a blocksize limit, he states B is true, but he has provided NO logic behind A-&gt;B.

It's not the same. For a soft fork to occur, any set of developers must first write the change. The size of this set of developers can be any number one or larger.
Then a majority of miners must agree to these changes. If a majority of miners agree, and a developer "calls it off", and the miners still agree, then the soft fork still happens.
Regarding the Core repository, it works as a consensus system, all of the developers with merge access must agree to a change for it to be submitted. The binaries for bitcoin are created deterministically using gitian builds signed by dozens of Core developers. I'm not sure how it could be made more decentralized, but making it more decentralized would be great.

The section you quoted wasn't about block size, it was about dynamic relay fees...


No, the attack becomes exponentially more costly if you implement dynamic relay fees correctly. But keep repeating that 2x the cost is the truth, eventually the uneducated reddit collective may make a le me-me about it. I don't know any other community where members could have so little understanding of security while being so confident they do.


Because miners aren't validating, did you not read that part? This attack shouldn't be hard to understand from a theory basis and it should be down-right-fucking-obvious since we have a practical example of what is happening right now and what happened on the 4th.


Yes, your significantly reduced cost.


It's a symptom of the problem of latency for the most part. As blocksize increases, validation becomes even more latent and even more of hashes are on unvalidated blocks.

But you might live past 78!
That's fine, there are many retirement plans that give you constant payout and count on people dying before you to fund your later years. They effectively act as "life" insurance in the sense that they insure you in the event that you live (as opposed to regular life insurance which should be called "death insurance").

We can only estimate based on the factors that cause latency. These factors include latency, validation time, bandwidth, etc. It got to the point that 40% of the network hashrate wasn't even validating blocks before they started mining on them due to the cost, which is a similar problem.




No, did you just imagine I wrote that every miner was 20%? Or include that strawman because you didn't have anything else to write in response. My response had nothing to do with all miners being equal and it had everything to do with miners being advantaged by having larger pools, I don't understand what is difficult to understand about this.


I'm not sure what you're talking about, the core devs were THE people speaking to Antminer and F2Pool telling them to fix their shit, they were among the first people to know what practices the miners had. This person you know claiming to be smarter than the core devs seem to be full of shit. 


Yes, that is what happened, you can see it documented in the link I sent you.


No, it seems you missed the point. You can only set a parameter at which you think the upgrade is safe. The miners behaving badly was an unexpected variable and otherwise the upgrade would have been fine. And as I said, even if the core devs had set the parameter at 99.9% there eventually would have been a miner that came along and produced a wrong-version block, or even an attacker that came along and produced a wrong version block causing a massive fork.


I'm not sure how that relates to my response to the aircraft example, however your analogy is akin to an aircraft being rated for 1M pounds (likely excessive even then) and the aircraft industry making airplanes 50% more efficient for the last few years, leading to lawmakers deciding "the passengers get to decide how much load a plane gets up to the limit we set that grows 50% every year". This means that as soon as the aircraft industry, which is already struggling with 400K lbs in passengers and must allow 1M lbs in passengers, will now have to keep hoping that avionics improve at 50% per year and can support the load, or expect a crash.


Yes, paint everything as black and white, call people good guys or bad guys, call this debate a war, it will help dramatize and incite people.
The truth is that The core devs, Gavin, Garzik, Blockstream, everyone on the mailing list, are mostly good guys. They have differences in opinion.
In short, big blockers seem to not understand what economies of scale, miner incentives, miner attacks, SPV clients, etc even are and it is frustrating to no end trying to inform people who think that there is some massive conspiracy going on. It reminds me of evolution skeptics who think scientists bury fake dinosaur bones and work with the devil.

Hi, I'd like to see the block size decrease and I have no vested interest in seeing fees increase, only a vested interest in Bitcoins success.

A bit risky to think that large miners will be willing to protect the network from their own growth, be it they need to with a soft fork. 
18% per year seems like a limit that will fit resource cheapening rates for the next few years, but I am a bit concerned that we may not see upload speed continue growing like download speed has been (and likely will continue) in the further future.
I'd prefer safely kicking the can down the road and have this proposal from 2017-2025 while real scalability solutions are being developed, but this is a good compromise.
@_date: 2015-07-26 23:51:57


The relationship is the block size increases latency and latency increases stale rate, in short.


I have NEVER seen anyone mix this up except for small blockers. You seem to be imagining it too since you bring it up where I never mixed them up.




The factors are that it makes 51% and selfish mining attacks much easier. Much more importantly, it drastically increases the mining economy of scale. A 20% miner would end up winning the fork race against the network in 20% of blocks they produce after the network. So, 1/5 blocks they produce will be staled, but 20% of those they will win back, this means they have a 4% revenue advantage (possibly 100% profit or more) over someone with a minuscule hashrate.


F2Pool did not validate the parent block because it "stole" its hash (ONLY the hash, not even the header) from BTC-China, who in turn had "stolen" it from BTCNuggets -- without realizing that BTCNuggets was still running v2 software, while the BIP66 rule had just been switched on.
No it isn't, I documented the entire event [here]( F2Pool didn't "steal" a hash from BTC-China, it used a block header from Antminer. And Antiminer didn't "steal" it's hash from BTCNuggets. They validated on top of a block-chain BTCNuggets mined a V2 block on, there was no hash they took from BTCNuggets.


This doesn't matter much, even if 99.9% of miners were using V2, this event would have happened when the 0.1% V2 miner created the block, or if any attacker created an invalid block (we must consider attackers as well as organic system failures).


No, it's more like "Our airline only can allow 1M pounds of passengers, lets not allow more than 1M pounds of passengers until the aircraft is rated for more".

Survival bias. You're not talking about the businesses that have failed due to zeroconf and the theft of thousands of Bitcoins.
Also there is the fact that 0-conf can work to the extent you can trust the person paying you. With or without RBF 0-conf doublespending is possible, but if you trust the customer or trust law enforcement to arrest a thieving customer, you can do fine with 0-conf. The problem is when we try to obstruct features for the sake of a false sense of security.


They're not, thousands of bitcoins have been stolen due to bad practices and accepting zero-conf.

Outstanding balance on credit cards isn't a good analogy. Credit cards have 10-20% interest rate generally. The US debt interest rate is ~2%, basically inflation. Also the US owns debt of other countries.
A more apt analogy is you are $140k in debt, every time you go further into debt your house becomes more valuable in proportion. Because of this, the homeowner decides that he might as well build a new pool increasing his debt, however that pool will increase in value relative to the dollar by ~2% every year, so he's really not expecting to lose any money and he can pay off his debt at any time, but he loses his house if he pays off his debt.
The problem is that storing your money with this guy is the safest option in the whole neighborhood and everyone uses his debt because the currency this guy is selling out of his house decreases in value by 2% every year by design, but they lose 0% every year if they stay invested with this guy. They think "why not, if this guy fails so will my currency, it is smarter to become his debtor than to just hold his tokens of exchange". Maybe one day a new neighbor will move in and offer new tokens that don't lose value by design.

False dichotomy. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 04:52:34
Full node count has nothing to do with the argument, I don't know what is unclear about this, the argument rests around the centralizing mining network that already allows the one largest miner to reverse a single block with a 40% success rate, the two largest miners to reverse 6 blocks with a 50% success rate and the three largest miners to reverse 100% of blocks with a 100% success rate. The erosion of trustlessness and sybil resistance is due to the miner network gravitating to centralization with higher network load.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:25:42


Lightning Network allows the transaction volume to grow far beyond 1MB/decaminute.


Yes, ZKP is ONE of the best methods for block data compression. In the mean time, we can look into other methods of trustless transacting other than the blockchain. 


Ideally no one other than the person you are paying when using the blockchain.


Optimization is happening. The network load has been REDUCED by software optimizations. I'm fine with the block size increasing when Bitcoin Core is optimizated to the point that the network is safe with larger blocks.


Yeah, and the network is marginally better than the GHash situation at this point. The mining ecosystem is still HORRIBLE at this point. The mining ecosystem is this way because of the network load. A low network load would make it much safer.


I don't write conclusions for the most part either, I am just contradicting your lies with facts. These facts are known, not concluded from some analysis unless you consider reading source code and research papers to be "analysis".
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:44:12
Like I said, you would need a client that can do it easily. Bitcoins technology doesn't prevent this from happening, it just isn't easily usable. That said, it can be done manually or with a script using bitcoin-tx  (comes with bitcoin core).
You then can use bitcoin-cli to get an output to redeem, however your script can use any client you prefer to get the outpoint, not only bitcoin-cli.
    bitcoin-cli listunspent
    ...
    "txid": "e79001d20f5cb4b7186901f32cafaf6ad54bac08c1bd978ddbd270011f352513",
    "vout": 17,
    "amount": 0.21196000,
    ...
Then you get the address the auto renewal service (Reddit) wants you to pay to. In this example reddit gives you the address n12Vgto27V11qtEsaeSDhk9QkDnT5ofc4n.  Also, Reddit wants you to renew on Aug 22. One unix time on Aug 22 is 1440216000.
Using bitcoin-tx you can now create the transaction. Step one, create an empty tx
    bitcoin-tx -create
    01000000000000000000
Step two, add a redeemed output using "bitcoin-tx currentTx in=TXID:VOUT"
    bitcoin-tx 01000000000000000000 in=e79001d20f5cb4b7186901f32cafaf6ad54bac08c1bd978ddbd270011f352513:17 
    01000000011325351f0170d2db8d97bdc108ac4bd56aafaf2cf3016918b7b45c0fd20190e71100000000ffffffff0000000000
Step three, add a pay-to-address output. The input amount is 0.21196000, so I will pay 0.20000000 to reddit and pay 0.01196000 in miner fees. The format of this command is "bitcoin-tx currentTx outaddr=VALUE:ADDRESS". Note: for it to recognize the testnet address I used in this example, I had to add the -testnet argument.
    bitcoin-tx -testnet 01000000011325351f0170d2db8d97bdc108ac4bd56aafaf2cf3016918b7b45c0fd20190e71100000000ffffffff0000000000 outaddr=0.2:n12Vgto27V11qtEsaeSDhk9QkDnT5ofc4n
    01000000011325351f0170d2db8d97bdc108ac4bd56aafaf2cf3016918b7b45c0fd20190e71100000000ffffffff01002d3101000000001976a914d600a8b42e14668ddfafe41059f0671612c949a788ac00000000
The final step involving bitcoin-tx is adding the locktime. "bitcoin-tx currentTx locktime=N"
    bitcoin-tx -testnet 01000000011325351f0170d2db8d97bdc108ac4bd56aafaf2cf3016918b7b45c0fd20190e71100000000ffffffff01002d3101000000001976a914d600a8b42e14668ddfafe41059f0671612c949a788ac00000000 locktime=1440216000
    01000000011325351f0170d2db8d97bdc108ac4bd56aafaf2cf3016918b7b45c0fd20190e71100000000ffffffff01002d3101000000001976a914d600a8b42e14668ddfafe41059f0671612c949a788acc0f3d755
Now I have an unsigned transaction. I use my wallet software, in this case bitcoin-cli to sign it:
    bitcoin-cli signrawtransaction 01000000011325351f0170d2db8d97bdc108ac4bd56aafaf2cf3016918b7b45c0fd20190e71100000000ffffffff01002d3101000000001976a914d600a8b42e14668ddfafe41059f0671612c949a788acc0f3d755
    {
      "hex":     "01000000011325351f0170d2db8d97bdc108ac4bd56aafaf2cf3016918b7b45c0fd20190e7110000006a473044022079e48c183b2e7d4419dde73b80305bbc7657c8ce35de43e0190137f3aef4ba980220636f2eac431692880da5bf2d8fadb9f7457a758610fc13e725864d45fb0f5317012103c89702c288898dbe4977f95349de110f2b4856e33943be4540a0567ae87a3e3bffffffff01002d3101000000001976a914d600a8b42e14668ddfafe41059f0671612c949a788acc0f3d755",
      "complete": true
    }
The final step is sending the "hex" value to reddit and them broadcasting it automatically when you're up for renewal (but not before that timestamp). This would be similar to charging to your credit card. You can "cancel" the renewal by spending the output before your renewal time comes.
Once again, this isn't me claiming that this is easy to do, I am only saying that lack of implementation is the reason this isn't being done already. Bitcoin technology allows for this.

If you're the recipient, it's not your fault the tx isn't being paid to you, it's the senders. I assume in most use cases the sender won't be using CPFP to get their tx confirmed since that leaves an incentive for their customer to pay the minimum fee and stick them with an additional fee.

I thought that was rhetorical. Here is the Bitcoin whitepaper bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf it will give you some insight into why mining needs to be decentralized.

Oh very interesting! My comment was about 51% of miners bullying (softforking) stakeholders and other miners into disallowing any blocks that don't follow some voting pattern. I'd have to think about incentives, but it seems a majority of miners who want the blocksize to grow in a certain pattern could contradict the stakeholders and do as they please. This is of course, not the smartest economically for them since a softfork with only, say, 60% of the miners is unsafe, though I don't see any other incentives preventing this.

We will be using Bitcoin on the lightning network. We will use the blockchain as well when desired.


If you want to call it that instead of just Bitcoin. I don't see why you can't, the tokens don't change value and the system has no risk of stealing your money as long as the blockchain maintains integrity.


A few reasons could be moving to a new ruleset on a new sidechain, paying a ton of small miners on blockchain, changing how you're managing your money from lightning to some other system, performing some action that is blockchain exclusive that has yet to be defined...

Yes we did survive an attack, you should recognize that surviving an attack doesn't mean safety, this is security 101. We probably should do the safe thing if doing it has no negative security tradeoffs...


It makes forcing large reorgs easier because it makes the mining ecosystem more centralized and less miners validating. We are seeing this problem in practice now with the 6 block reorg that was only 3 days ago. What I'm wondering is how you can possibly come to the conclusion that the only possible type of attack on the network is spamming transactions.

Yep, the best option is to allow people to have secure wallets without expending large amounts of resources.

Unfortunately this appears to be a product of you being at the bottom of Bitcoins steep learning curve.

Changing the blocksize isn't the only scaling solution, and it is a terrible scaling solution.

Somewhere around at least 25% (quite possibly much more) of the hash power supports RBF, not sure about CPFP (but I think RBF is a better solution anyways). I'm not sure what % of wallets support it since there isn't a sure way of telling what wallet software everyone is running.


Absolutely. This is a good example of how it can lower fees, you don't have to throw a high good enough fee, you can just pay a sufficient fee to start with.


Through education and intuitive user interfaces.


I disagree, Bitcoin in itself is an experiment. Addresses are an experiment, multisig is an experiment. Experiment isn't a bad word.


Oh, it is not only necessary, but will naturally occur as fee pressure builds. Miners aren't going to accept transactions in the order they appear, they will take the highest fee transactions. Might as well write the software to reflect the incentives.


Yeah, that would suck, more software needs fee prediction and RBF in them.

I doubt it would double, but I'm certain it would benefit the price. The Litecoin price doubling is a reflection of segwit taking it from being something like 0.1% chance of being the defacto crypto currency to a 0.2% chance.

Blocks have no IP address, but looking at which transactions are reversed may be useful, however we are degrading the security assumptions of Bitcoins by thinking we can prevent a miner from attacking by investingating his possibly unprovable thefts.
IMO, the security assumptions of Bitcoin should be that it is costly to attack, not that it is risky to attack because you may not cover your traces properly.

If you can't see it, the sybil problem is the direction you should be looking.


Pools quite often don't earn anything from their blocks because they become stale, also hashers generally don't get paid per block. There are many other factors that would lead to miners not knowing they aren't getting paid, but EVEN if they had some way of figuring out that their loss is due to attack rather than natural events that happen multiple times per day in the network, the pool could just simply... pay them as if they did earn a block reward.


Really, you can't imagine a financial gain large enough to merit the loss of a single 25BTC block? How about a 26BTC double spend?
GHash.io stole 3000BTC from a betting website (and yes, they were caught because they explicitly said they were the block creators in their coinbase, they didn't cover their tracks) and they went on to be the largest mining pool in the history of Bitcoin.
You are making a lot of security assumptions, "their pool members will hire an elite detective to solve the sybil problem and find them".
I don't understand why you need to throw these crazy limitations in there. For some reason you are limiting their theft to the value of a car? There are a lot of Bitcoins that can be doublespent, a lot of damage that can be done with a big pool. You are also claiming there is some limitation to being able to launder the money?
Bitcoin shouldn't have the security assumption "well maybe there won't be enough transaction volume for a miner to even care about theft" and "well they are gonna have a hard time laundering it!".
Bitcoin should be trustless, plain and simple, no far fetched security assumptions that rely on limits in transaction volume, or rely on solving the sybil problem, or rely on miners not being able to cover their tracks, or rely on miners not being smart enough to execute an attack, or... in general rely on trusting miners.

The problem is individual hashers have no idea what their pool is doing. If validating the blocks you were mining was trivial and all these individuals were validating and mining, this wouldn't be a problem, in fact a 51% pool comprised of validators wouldn't be a problem.


If trust is acceptable to you and you believe the small number of actors controlling a currency can be trusted not to attack through economic incentives then there are much more efficient ways to have a trust-invoking currency.
For everyone else, there's Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:47:03
I think there's a bit of a disconnect between us. The reason for limiting the block size isn't because it is thought that more fees paid to miners leads to decentralization. It's because additional system load has centralizing effects.
We have been teetering at "too centralized" for a little while now. The thing is, we have already been in the 50% attack range a few times now and even today the top two miners can collude to reverse 6 confirmations with &gt;50% success rate. This isn't sufficiently trustless in the sense that a colluding or coercing entity could attack the network relatively cheaply. This can be fixed through reducing the network load and economies of scale, however.

They have the power to force a reorg of any size. They absolutely can spend anyones money because they can unwind all transactions paying to that person and take the original minting transaction for themselves then reallocate the coins to everyone except for that person.
"pausing" isn't the only problem, a 50% miner has the ability to reverse or censor any or all transaction, they nearly have the power of a bank today.

Firstly, we have had upgrade alerts and it takes much more than a few days to get a reasonable number of people to upgrade.
 
This would be dangerous because Bitcoin is meant to be trustless. You can't simply expect everyone on the network to see an upgrade and run whatever code the person alerting says you should. A central authority declaring that you should run some code is not an upgrade mechanism for a decentralized protocol.
@_date: 2016-02-07 10:56:03
This requires only a majority as well. The difficulty is equal for every miner and a changed difficulty caused by, say, 40% of unupgraded miners using "real" timestamps would be reverted by 60% since the tallest blockchain is the only with the most work done (considering difficulty).
@_date: 2017-04-03 23:20:16


By doublespending. You pay someone $N minted out of thin air, then that transaction is automatically reversed because it is in an invalid chain and all other miners are ignoring it.


This is downgrading from knowing that a transaction is valid to trusting a third party. This is the state of fiat right now.


Assuming exchanges follow best practices even when it gets very expensive (historically they haven't).


Right now miners don't have an incentive to do this because they would be immediately rejected. If no one was validating it's a different story.


Only if they validate. Otherwise they're blindfolded.

Yes miners, though it is obvious that smaller blocks don't centralize miners when you understand what the factors in miner centralization are. These include outsourcing running a full node (are you going to claim that miners will run full nodes more if they have a higher cost?), an economy of scale in mining introduced by a full node (are you going to claim that full nodes are free to run?), an economy of scale introduced by increased bandwidth (are you going to claim that it takes a shorter amount of time to transfer and validate a 1MB block than a 100KB block?).

No, 51% is literally the threshold at which miners can mine more than one block for every block everyone else mines. This is why the number is significant.

Or it could be free if the system gravitates to it's most efficient state organically due to increased costs and latency.


You could do that, but it isn't cheap. If a single person is willing to pay $1 for a 333 byte transaction, you have to pay $432000 per day to keep him from transacting. 


Not necessarily, for example, green address properly setup with a locktime transaction is a central authority that cannot steal your money. We could have centralization in exchanges as well, 80% using one exchange isn't a huge risk (USING, NOT STORING FUNS ON) since the other 20% exchanges are available and new ones can be made, however an 80% miner basically means Bitcoin is useless.

Network bandwidth isn't unlimited, you are limited by the relay fee rate and the cost associated with that.
You say "twice" as if there is only one type of attack, you are so vague that I'm not even sure what you're referring to. The large current blocksize was shown to make large reorg attacks orders of magnitude cheaper. Additional resources needed by the system has led miners to not validate transactions and increase centralization. It's not unexpected that the network could become centralized organically without an attacker with large block sizes.
@_date: 2016-02-12 23:54:13

Ideally the cost of mining will shift away from manufacturing and towards electricity. It has done so to an extent already. Mining in many cases is more efficient in homes due to the fact that you can heat your homes with it, giving these companies an incentive to ship their product.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:24:26


I'm sorry, but this point has been discussed tirelessly and it is a bit silly that you are making claims about the feasibility of short block times without doing research first. Decreasing the block time has significant damage to consensus in both scenarios where there are no attackers and there are active attackers. The hashrate required for selfish mining and 51% attacks decreases. The stale rate increases dramatically, not only decreasing the value of a confirmation, but also making large miners disproportionately more profitable, leading to a centralizing effect.
I recommend reading this 
Many throw together broken cryptographic schemes because they can "get rich quick" when acting in the cryptocurrency world, but the limitations of the blockchain lead to a significantly reduced security with a block time decrease regardless of these shysters claims.

I'm sorry idiots claimed that Bitcoins value was in the fact that it is a low fee payment network, but you really should have done more personal research. The blockchain cannot grow to arbitrarily large sizes while maintaining decentralization. There are other scaling methods being worked on so it may be possible to have a global low fee payment network some day, but the technology to do so is still in development.


The only reason the blockchain needs to act as a settlement network is that it cannot handle an arbitrarily large number of transactions. If there were no tradeoffs in increasing the blocksize it would have been done already.

@_date: 2015-07-23 04:38:45


The developers effectively don't have the authority to do so unless miners and merchants run their software. They however do have the authority to make this software available. 
So what software should the core developers make available? If I were to dictate to the developers what they should do I would ask first that they not violate the security of Bitcoin. An important component of Bitcoin is trustlessness, without it, we might as well drop the blockchain and pick up a more efficient system.
There are other goals one might have like "does this keep Bitcoin cheap" or "is this what Satoshi said he wanted", however I don't see the point of achieving these goals if loss of  trustlessness is the cost.
So does increasing the blocksize put trustlessness in jeopardy? Like most things in security it isn't black and white. The mining ecosystem becomes less secure and more centralized when there is a larger network load. It is a reaction that is caused by the cost of supporting the networks security becomming greater than its benefits. For example, every mining pool member could effectively take the control back from the pool and generate their own blocks, causing a huge decrease in the trust we are required to put in these pools. There is, however, a cost to these individual miners running a full node including additional latency for the pool users, additional resources for the pool if they are using the relay network, and many many other factors that increase as the block size increases. This isn't limited to individual miners in pools either, a certain Chinese mining pool was not validating blocks due to the stales that would be caused. The cause of the pool not validating was that their geographic separation from other mining pools made it more expensive to mine fully validating. It actually is very efficient to have all your miners in a geographically centralized area, like a single warehouse, and it becomes even more efficient as the network load increases. In general, there is a centralizing effect to the mining ecosystem that causes the requirement of trust, the antithesis of Bitcoin.
I usually get responses like "These miners can afford to run full nodes", but the question isn't whether they can run full nodes, it is whether they will! At what point does a miner benefit from a full node? A 0.1% miner may realize that the expenses of running a full node cut into their profits by 5%, and then through a rough estimate realize that their 0.1% of hash power belonging to a large mining pool doesn't harm the network, and by extension them *that* much. This leads to them not running a full node. The minimal hash power required for "profitable" validation varies based on factors including the loss of profit through latency caused by geographic placement, the gain in personal "profit" through the enjoyment that comes from running a full node as a hobby. However, as a general trend, the minimal hash power someone will run a full node at decreases and the cost of a full node increases.
At this point, this economy of scale induced effect has led to miners being massive, the largest two miners individually can both reverse a confirmation with 40% success. Combined, they can reverse 6 confirmations with 50% success. This is quite dangerous considering that a single government may attack Bitcoin relatively cheaply. We must consider this effect and work towards making mining decentralized by reducing the system load. This can be accomplished by having the blocksize increase at a rate lower than the rate at which hardware and software changes decrease the expenses caused by block size.


This is absurd FUD, the current implementation should handle a sudden instant reduction in fees caused by a sudden increase in block space just fine.

Likely because you made up the phrase. What's happening is they're not validating blocks and they're only checking that a previous miners block header is valid, which is commonly called "SPV mining".


The entire reason miner adoption is measured is because miner adoption cannot be measured using time, it makes no sense to use time despite Gavins foolish proposal using time after 75%. Anyways, even if 100% of miners had adopted, the network still would be vulnerable to a single miner creating a bad block since 40%+ of the miners weren't validating.


Since we're using avionics as an analogy, it means essentially the same thing. The airplane is rated for 1M lbs, so it has a limit of 1M lbs.


There certainly is, you just haven't looked into it (or you have ignored or denied it). See

All numbers less than 1 are also less than 2, therefore, all blocksizes less than 1MB are valid for clients with 2MB limits. A softfork enforcing a 1MB limit, reduced from 2MB doesn't break consensus. When consensus is set on a 1MB limit, blocks above 1MB are not consensus compatible, therefore an increase to 2MB breaks consensus.

You're misunderstanding the security. It is free to reverse a 0-conf transaction for a miner, there is no point assuming a 0-conf transaction is confirmed. The ENTIRE purpose for Bitcoin is solving the problem of unconfirmed transactions . If 0-conf worked we wouldn't need Bitcoin or the blockchain. On the other hand 10% of mining power would fail at reversing 1 confirmation 80% of the time and in that time they could have been earning Bitcoins through honest mining. The incentives are properly in place to make most 1-conf transactions difficult to reverse. The incentives aren't properly in place for 0-conf.
TL;DR you could try to replace by fee for 1-conf and a 10% miner, but at mininimum you would have to pay the fee for the potentially hundreds of Bitcoins of energy exhausted trying to reverse the block, more likely much more given it hurts their investment as well.

The centralization allowed the hacker to take some degree of control over a large mining farm, rather than a small one. If you had a small amount of hash power, a hacker temporarily taking over your farm wouldn't be a risk to the Bitcoin network.

You can ignore longer chains to create an incentive for miners to not produce blocks in unrecognized blockchains. If they continue producing invalid blocks they will be harming themselves along with the network.


Maybe they can, but it is incredibly costly. If they were to make a contentious change then during the time period that their blocks were invalid they would be losing a large amount of money. In the same sense, 51% of miners can choose to make a change saying "all your money is now ours", since this isn't a desirable change, all they can do is hold the system hostage, they cannot force people to meet their demands however. I agree, miners have some sway, but 51% isn't absolute power (except in a softfork).

GBT. Essentially the pool is used for reducing variance, but block creation is handled by miners individually. Also, P2Pool does something similar except with trustless miner rewards.
.If I created a device that cost a consumer $100eu, and managed all Bitcoin related activity securely, AND mined independently (no gimmick). How would that sound? No toaster bs, a true device marketed as a Bitcoin bank for your house. Full node, miner (weak, strength in numbers), blockchain API, wallet software, hardware wallet compatible, etc.
Using your miner as a heater is a good way to recycle the energy used to power your ASIC and essentially make your electricity costs for mining zero. I don't like the idea of a product that is a miner and has a full node. That means if I want to buy ten from you I will have 9 redundant full nodes in my house for no reason.


You could do that, but even better you could promise a steady income using these trustless pools..

Right, I should have phrased it as explicitly stating he was talking about miner centralization, as with the last 9 words.


Though, your question is legitimate and I misinterpreted it.
The benefit to not centralizing nodes is that more fully validating nodes means that miners can less profitably attack users, which means such an attack is less likely. The absolute count of nodes isn't important, but it is a predictor for how much of the economy is actually validating their transactions. If it were measurable (which it is not), I'd argue that what we should look at is the total transaction volume which is *not* accepted by a fully validating node.
There are quite a few concerns related to a large portion of Bitcoin users not validating transactions. In the eyes of non-validating users, miners are free to create money out of thin air. They are free to send the user money that doesn't exist. 
And with a sufficient portion of users not validating they could simply come together to agree to change the rules of Bitcoin. Right now if miners collectively decided that the 21M coin limit doesn't exist, they would not get very far. Users would ignore their blocks and the "bitcoins" they created wouldn't be accepted for the goods and services they wanted. In a scenario where no one validates blocks, there's hardly anything anyone can do to stop them.
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:22:07
Miner soft forks are fine if they are properly tested and vetted. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 05:22:25


Not really. You could run a program on your computer and call it Bitcoin, but no one is going to care about what you have to say if you start talking about your awesome spreadsheet editor called Bitcoin. The same goes for hardforking without consensus. If you start pretending Litecoin is Bitcoin, then people are going to think you're crazy because you'd be arbitrarily redefining a word and what you'd be saying wouldn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:00:39


Right, I misspoke. Either way, they can convince someone they sent them coins in a fraudulent way.


How do they know they aren't? The problem Bitcoin solved is the sybil problem. Reintroducing it eliminates the usefulness of Bitcoin in that regard.


Maybe, maybe not. Taking away security assumptions one by one is not a good idea IMO.


It stops them from tricking those validating into thinking an invalid transaction is valid.


Again, if users aren't validating they have no idea what they're following.


Making sure the transactions they receive aren't fraudulent?
Making sure bitcoin remains having sensible rules including a 21M bitcoin limit, etc?

So what do we have now? Bitcoin Unlimited, boasting about being stable enough to be called 1.0, featuring
* [thin block vulnerability can cause clients to ban each other, if all clients were Unlimited, the network could have been split]( With a side helping of complaints that core devs are finding these vulnerabilities rather than ignoring them: "We seem to be on you mind a great deal these days...we just won't go away will we. How's your ulcer doing? Hopefully you're getting the help you need and not taking yourself so seriously...it's bad for soul."
* [not checking the signature of transactions if a block is older than 30 days](
* [Improper block validation (oh my what a surprise, hardforking without consensus has lost their users money)](
* [Closed source patches!](
* [And of course the bug they are calling a feature: any-size-you-want blocks, not only breaking consensus into an arbitrary number of shards, but greatly strengthening centralization incentives in the system.](
This culture of conspiracy theories, insufficient testing, ad hominem, non-technical opposition to code reviews, opposition to security audits, and criticism of untested incentives leads to a system filled with bugs that are caused by either a lack of understanding of the code that is written or a lack of understanding of how Bitcoin itself works.

In the derivatives market, physically-settled refers to settlement giving you the product. For example, there are cash-settled SPY futures, which pay you cash when the contract expires, and there are physically-settled SPY futures which give you a share of SPY when the contract expires.
Therefore, physically-settled bitcoin swaps give you actual bitcoin when the swaps expire, as opposed to cash.
This is confusing terminology, because it derives from the origins of futures markets. Originally futures were just physical commodities like cattle, wheat, and corn. If you had a cash settled cheese future, you would be given the settlement price of the commodity (as determined by the exchange) in cash. Otherwise if the contract was physically settled, you actually are delivered cheese.

In what way is Bitcoin Core not decentralized? I literally don't know of any open source project which is more decentralized.
None of the following can be said of btc1, while all of the following can be said of Core:
* Hundreds of developers work on it
* All meetings about the direction and changes to it take place in public and have available logs
* All releases require agreement of all 5 developers with merge access, preventing one developer from being corrupted and pushing malicious changes.
* All releases have gitian builds.
* Each change is cautiously made and reviewed to ensure it doesn't break network consensus
Or are you arguing that Cores "chain" specifically is not decentralized? If so, I've got to answer your next question, "What legitimate reason do you have to oppose 2mb blocks besides the fact that Core opposes it?", with the fact that increasing the block size is going to harm both node, and more importantly miner centralization.
While pools like F2Pool were promoting a block size increase, they weren't validating the entire block because doing so would reduce their profits by too much. They effectively centralized the network to the point where any miner who could produce a single invalid block was able to cause a 6 block chain split because they felt 1MB was too much to validate and only were validating the first 80 bytes.
The Bitcoin network is not in a safe state when this is possible, and the effects of large blocks on centralization have been discussed to death. Not trying to sound rude, but have you really not read any of this before?

That is a true, the notion doesn't apply to all things that aren't software.


Blockchains have a pretty basic design and provide a very specific solution. You can change a few parameters and the way its stored, but not much else until it isn't a blockchain.


Throwing trusty contracts and software on a decentralized trustless blockchain doesn't add much no matter how easy it was for the developer.


Sure, but when you make a CPU, it doesn't implement python, it implements X86 and can process instructions from a python interpreter.


That may be true, however it is inevitable and there is no other known mechanism that can provide the same security PoW blockchains can.

Moores law is slowing and your assertion won't always be true. For a safe decentralized network, miners musn't have a strong need to use centralized pools and in order to achieve that, running a full node must be passive. Expensive blockchain validation means a economies of scale in mining and economies of scale in mining mean centralization.

Yeah, re-reading it he is and you are right, however I don't think that's a concern.
Pay to address transactions don't require the Bitcoin blockchain, however that isn't a reason for miners to object to them. Bitcoin exclusivity shouldn't be a requirement for miners to like a feature.
Regarding sending fees to non-miners, I agree, this will decrease fee pressure in the short term, however in the long term I expect the benefits of scaling Bitcoin to help miners.

@_date: 2015-09-01 22:27:56
Copied and pasted from another thread:
**My incomplete summary of problems with large blocks.**
Goal of Bitcoin:
* What software should the core developers make available? If I were to dictate to the developers what they should do I would ask first that they not violate the security of Bitcoin. An important component of Bitcoin is trustlessness, without it, we might as well drop the blockchain and pick up a more efficient system. There are other goals one might have like "does this keep Bitcoin cheap" or "is this what Satoshi said he wanted", however I don't see the point of achieving these goals if loss of trustlessness is the cost.
General mining situation - outsourcing block validation:
* So does increasing the blocksize put trustlessness in jeopardy? Like most things in security it isn't black and white. The mining ecosystem becomes less secure and more centralized when there is a larger network load. It is a reaction that is caused by the cost of supporting the networks security becoming greater than its benefits. For example, every mining pool member could effectively take the control back from the pool and generate their own blocks, causing a huge decrease in the trust we are required to put in these pools. There is, however, a cost to these individual miners running a full node including additional latency for the pool users, additional resources for the pool if they are using the relay network, and many many other factors that increase as the block size increases.
Benefits to big miners - economies of scale:
* This isn't limited to individual miners in pools either, a certain Chinese mining pool was not validating blocks due to the stales that would be caused, though this can be improved partially with IBLT. The cause of the pool not validating was that their geographic separation from other mining pools made it more expensive to mine fully validating. It actually is very efficient to have all your miners in a geographically centralized area, like a single warehouse, and it becomes even more efficient as the network load increases. In general, as blocks become bigger there is a centralizing effect to the mining ecosystem and that causes the requirement of trust, the antithesis of Bitcoin.
Getting small miners to run full nodes:
* I usually get responses like "These miners can afford to run full nodes", but the question isn't whether they can run full nodes, it is whether they will! At what point does a miner benefit from a full node? A 0.1% miner may realize that the expenses of running a full node cut into their profits by 5%, and then through a rough estimate realize that their 0.1% of hash power belonging to a large mining pool doesn't harm the network, and by extension them that much. This leads to them not running a full node. The minimal hash power required for "profitable" validation varies based on factors including the loss of profit through latency caused by geographic placement, the gain in personal "profit" through the enjoyment that comes from running a full node as a hobby. However, as a general trend, the minimal hash power someone will run a full node at decreases and the cost of a full node increases.
Decreasing attack cost with higher network load: 
* At this point, this economy of scale induced effect has led to miners being massive, the largest two miners individually can both reverse a confirmation with 40% probability of success. Combined, they can reverse 6 confirmations with 75% success. This is quite dangerous considering that a single government may attack Bitcoin relatively cheaply, or a profit-seeking miner may decide to attack as we have seen before with the 3000BTC GHash.io theft.
Increasing attack benefit with higher network load:
* One of the main differences between a miner attacking an SPV-using merchant and a full-node-using merchant is the ability to forge money out of thin air that can't be spent in a reorg. If you, an economical and malicious miner, want to rip off a merchant running a full node, you need to send them YOUR (or your partners) money and **then** spend your hashing power (money) attempting to steal their money. When you rip off a merchant running an SPV node, you can create money out of thin air, create invalid blocks, then be guaranteed that your payment will be reversed. There is no up front cost other than the electricity of your mine and you can block withhold to make your attack much more likely to succeed than the reorg attack mentioned in the full node example. In short, many SPV nodes make miner attacks much more profitable and likely to succeed. But it's not like full nodes don't have to be worried, they too can be caught up in the attack because including a full node target in the attack doesn't cost additional mining resources. The number of full nodes online doesn't matter nearly as much as the number and fraction of merchants validating payments with full nodes.
* We must consider this centralizing effect caused by large blocks and work towards making mining decentralized and the ecosystem safer by reducing the system load. This can be accomplished by having the blocksize increase at a rate lower than the rate at which hardware and software changes decrease the expenses caused by block size.

40% each year is hardly safe. Mining is dangerously centralized as it is, 5MB blocks in 5 years is very very risky. Running a full node would be incredibly inconvenient for the average miner.

There have been no ad-hominem attacks, and you are expecting me to audit the security of a cryptocurrency, likely dozens of hours/thousands of dollars of work, for free is ridiculous. If you expect me to dedicate thousands of dollars worth of my time towards attacking a currency, I expect you to pay me.
You continuously make the claim that these centralized/low value altcoins aren't attackable because they haven't been attacked, while there is actually no incentive because they are so worthless as I have explained.
I wasn't making any claims about superiority, I was explaining why your request that I audit the security of a specific cryptocurrency to prove a point is ridiculous.
If you're not going to address my statement and instead waste my time with meta-arguments, there is no point in arguing with you.
"It hasn't been attacked, therefore it is safe" is infuriatingly stupid. If you want someone to prove it is vulnerable, offer a proper reward for a NaS attack on NXT, because right now there is no incentive. As soon as you attempt to doublespend it will become worthless, mining all the blocks only gets you $10/day.

I think your problem is you haven't read the whitepaper yet and are confusing LN with classic payment channels. LN is a network of payment channels that allow essentially an analog of what you can do on the blockchain without having to broadcast the tx to 10K people and pay the costs associated with that.
So yes, the $20 tx fee is used to setup a dedicated payment channel so those two can join the LN, then 100 other people decide to join and he is still using the hub he created with his transaction.

They manifest at very low levels. A 5% miner can potentially reverse a confirmation and steal from someone every day, which could be used to increase their profitability.
However, a mining network with the largest miner being a 5% miner and that miner attacking is arguably a somewhat rare and low risk state for the mining ecosystem to be in. Right now, however, we are already at a level at which these problems manifest. The largest miner, F2Pool can selfish mine profitably, they can reverse a confirmation more than half of the time, they can collude with the other largest miner (as they already are in not validating their blocks before mining on them) and reverse 6 confirmations 75% of the time, or just make fake confirmations and attack those using SPV clients (which will become more prevalent as the blockchain requires more resources) or old clients.
@_date: 2015-09-20 04:20:29
No, you seem to have little to no understanding of the situation. Decentralized mining doesn't mean everyone has the same hashrate (two 50% miners are way worse worse than 1000 miners ranging from 0 to 5%) and solo mining is just a little irrelevant icing on the cake. Solo vs pooled mining has no relevance to this situation.

Great, so we can easily run a centralized currency is the UK.

Once again, an attack not happening isn't a proof of it not being flawed. If you pay a security expert to attack, then I'm sure they would be happy to.


Nope, that's not a rule, though the paper doesn't do handwaving, it explains why PoS systems aren't secure because there isn't an incentive to converge.


Right, we should only discuss the ones that can destroy a currency, like the one in Poelstras paper.


There are many many many zero days that are reported and not executed upon. When a critical vulnerability is found in a major operating system, the security experts tend to say "well shit, lets fix this" rather than "the network is still operational, this is bullshit".


If you think users not having anything at stake, or any incentive to keep the network in consensus is a non-issue, then the system probably isn't a distributed consensus.

You need to do some thinking about the Bitcoin system and consider the implications of a single party naturally obtaining &gt;50% of the mining market share, similar to how one party currently has &gt;50% of the desktop OS marketshare, and another the search engine marketshare. It is an extreme economy of scale that gives you the ability to disallow your competition from existing at no cost. 
The reason a state enforced monopoly is argued to be able to exist is because the smaller company can be coerced by the state using laws. In the Bitcoin mining ecosystem a majority miner could simply create laws within the system that disallow any miner except himself to mine, to his own benefit.
Bitcoin is unlike any of the systems this article is discussing. Consumers can't simply choose to go to a competitor if one miner is being evil. None of the industries we see today become **less** valuable as one company becomes larger. Google having 70% of the search engine market share doesn't hurt us, but a miner having 70% of the hash-share effectively makes Bitcoin useless. Unlike telephone companies and others discussed, Bitcoin mining can be considered to be a perfect competition and the most efficient miners will survive while the least efficient will die (which means the big get bigger if there is an economy of scale). You can't sell a slightly different product, you can't have better customer service, it's a matter of how efficiently you can convent electricity into hashes into Bitcoins.

No, we need to reduce the cost of using Bitcoin safely. Hard forks require the full node merchant/miner to determine whether they agree with the changes, where the economic consensus is, and upgrade based on this.
This is expensive and making it more expensive to be a trustless Bitcoin user causes the system to require more trust.
In this example, a full node operator may dedicate hundreds or thousands of dollars of man hours towards determining which ruleset they want to agree to. Or they may passively accept what a central authority is saying they should be using for a very small cost, or they may just not run a full node at all at that point.
If we have a hard fork every decade the per year cost is even lower, I would argue as the time between forks increases, the cost decreases superlinearly due to the information around the fork becoming more available and understood and better structured for reading and understanding as time goes on.
TL;DR: The only people who should be suggesting **regular** hard forks should be those wanting to harm or destroy Bitcoin.

The best option may be your own server hosted in a shared server room with an armed guard. Using a host like [Linode increases your risk since]( since there are now two parties that can fuck up.
It is also true that the other party can "fuck up" when you are hosting in a server room, but at least they have to have someone physically come in and take server, a hack is on your hands not theirs. Because of this risk, you will want a small value hot wallet (valued less than the cost of attempting to get the server by going past armed guards) and a large cold wallet. Or ideally you wouldn't manage customers funds at all.

Bitcoin requires some third parties to relay the blocks to you, but you don't need to trust all of them if you have full node security. You can have SPV security and trust the miners while a third party sends  you the transaction data, or you can have no block header validation and trust the third party 100% (this is worse because the miner at least has to pay to defraud you).
You're always using a third party, it's just a matter of how much you need to trust that third party, and you minimize that trust with a full node.

Email isn't comparable to Bitcoin. Centralization can be considered a failure of Bitcoin, therefore we have to take on costs associated with not only decentralization, but consensus.

Perhaps he doesn't get put in prison by his government, perhaps he shorts the currency, destroys it and profits. I'm not saying you're doomed to theft in centralized currencies, I'm saying centralized currencies are easy and fast, but have the cost of requiring trust. Bitcoin wasn't created to be a centralized currency it bears many cost to maintain trustlessness. If you would like a centralized currency and don't want to deal with the costs of decentralization, you can always make your own centralized currency. 


This is a fairly weak countermeasure. All it takes then is an FPGA farm to 51% attack forever.


If you think a central authority can be incentivised to not harm his currency, that's good for you. Such a currency is actually very easy to make. For everyone who doesn't want to trust the good will of a central authority, we have Bitcoin.

Right, but given 95% of miners (or minimally 51%) validating with the new rules, they will come to consensus. They are only slightly more vulnerable to double spends and still have stronger than SPV security. With a hard fork, old clients have weaker than SPV security due to the ease of a fake conf attack.
The softfork upgrade mechanism, as you have mentioned, has safely been performed plenty of times, it is only in recent times, where the mining ecosystem is much worse, that we have had problems.
@_date: 2015-09-07 03:16:45
This is only useful assuming miners that choose to be nice to you rather than being rational economic actors. It is pretty misleading/wrong. 99.9% propagation doesn't mean 0.1% chance of doublespend at all especially since 0.1% (or 0.0%) of nodes may be a 25% miner.

Bitcoin isn't quite centralized to major chip manufacturers. There are a variety, while Ethereum has only one or two major manufacturers.
The cost of mining has shifted to being the power rather than the hardware (unlike mining Ethereum), so the manufacturers have less incentive to mine themselves and more incentive to ship to those with cheaper power.

Yes, it is much cheaper to attack SPV clients, though you can simultaneously attack both.
@_date: 2015-11-09 03:45:23
I think it is also important to point out that lots of people seem to get confused about what consensus means in the context of distributed consensus. There were some comments by people (Mike and other BIP101 promoters) complaining that a soft forks code would be merged and occur when the core devs wouldn't merge hard forking consensus code.
The thing is, a soft fork retains consensus and a hard fork doesn't. This is constantly questioned, and people complain that Bitcoin Core supposedly doesn't retain consensus with very early Bitcoin versions, and should be called an altcoin because of it. The thing though, is that it does.
The usual complaint is something like "I didn't approve of the 1MB blocksize reduction" or "I didn't approve of P2SH", therefore it doesn't have consensus. The problem with that thinking is that even if your client didn't recognize those changes, you would **still be in consensus**. 
Let's remember what staying in consensus means, you are in agree with the other Bitcoin users about which blockchain is the tallest valid blockchain. So, if all miners say, for a simple example, "we will no longer accept OP_RETURN transactions", you wouldn't lose consensus, you would just be fed exclusively blocks that didn't have OP_RETURN. So saying a miners decision about what to or to not include in their block "didn't have your consensus" is nonsensical because you don't decide what they put in their block beyond the limitations set in block validity rules.
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:36:45
Maybe it's because the difficulty doesn't need to change in this attack scenario and indicates nothing? Or maybe I'm just misinterpreting your comment, but what I got out of it is "you can somehow determine that you are being attacked based on the difficulty value", which isn't true.

Turing completeness is at best a form of compression. You cannot allow allow for unbounded running of scripts due to the halting problem.

If the database had to check a txindex and each user had to maintain a txindex of all tx that ever happened, it would be significantly more difficult to run a full node at little benefit.

@_date: 2015-09-16 23:32:26
The incentives seem bad. Unless there is a reward or transaction fee for mining, the miners have an incentive to always reverse their transactions. Another question is how much does each bank spend to secure the network.
Even if all but one are honest, there is at least an order of magnitude greater benefit to attacking the system than protecting  yourself and being honest, so if every bank spends $10K/day on mining, one bank could just 51% attack spending $100K/day.
Then you may argue that the banks have an incentive to then secure the network up to the amount being transacted. Let's say $1B is being transacted from each bank each day. That means that the banks should make it cost more than $1B to attack them. How do they do this? By spending orders of magnitude more than they earn in transaction fees to secure the transaction.

You can't prove decentralization of miners period. It isn't possible. You can prove centralization by finding a warehouse somewhere, but that isn't easy either with competent adversary.
The axiom isn't correct because it should be an L shape, not a curve. Any requirement of having declared miners that aren't anonymous requires a central authority, and is centralized.
In the proposed system, Andreas gets 10% of mining power if I understand correctly. If you require him to sign "random" blocks, perhaps blocks which hash to a certain value that you only get 1/10th of the time, then you are A) Allowing miners to softfork him out of the system and B) allowing Andreas to censor miners for free by only mining on top of blocks that he likes.
The other proposal, mining with a different algorithm every time, basically hands the currency over to the government, because this would cause mining to be done on FPGAs. [ASICs are good]( and reverting to non-ASIC hardware that gives Google and/or the US Govt a majority is incredibly dangerous.
Implementing this is not a protection of Bitcoin, it is a vulnerability. What we can do is incentivize decentralization. This means decreasing economies of scale, making full validation mining easier, and creating other incentives to decentralize.

It's not really a matter of "can they" as much as "will they". Theoretically, much more than 50% of the world can handle 90MB blocks if they dedicate almost all of their income to paying for the development of infrastructure so they can get better bandwidth rather than food, shelter, and luxuries. However they won't do that.
A better question would be "how many stores accepting Bitcoin are going to pay $50 extra per month for additional bandwidth for a full node rather than decreasing network security and their own security by using an SPV client"?


Of course your math assumes that Bitcoins network topology is one in which there is a network radius of two and everyone has one peer it seems? (I'm not really sure what security assumptions you're making when blocks are being relayed between three users in ten minutes o_o) In reality, it can take quite a few relays to fully propagate the block. So under conditions where the network radius is 5 relays (which is generous), you actually take 50 minutes to relay. So divide your figure by 5 again to get back to your original assumption and you now have 20MB blocks.
But wait, your assumption that blocks take 10 minutes is wrong. Blocks actually are generated in a poisson distribution, and it is quite likely that 6 blocks will be generated within 10 minutes, however being that it takes 60 minutes to propagate these blocks under your assumptions, it will take 60 for those at the far corners of the network to reach consensus. 20MB blocks lead to a weak consensus as well.
When you do make explicit assumptions like "blocks take ten minutes" and implicit assumptions like "the network radius is 1", then you end up with incorrect numbers. Of course this is only relating to stable consensus within full nodes, not health in the mining ecosystem which requires even more strict rules


I'm not going to touch on their [orphan rate, but you can read this if you like](
What should be obvious is that if you're accepting less transactions, you're getting paid less in fees and that creates a system in which miners with more bandwidth are more profitable.


Storing spam isn't really a solution to spam. [There is an implemented solution to preventing the spam from using too much RAM]( however moving it to the disk is just a lazy solution that comes with many other problems as I've described.


Pretty much no altcoin has larger blocks than Bitcoin, but if you want to talk about altcoins that have components of their system that cause economies of scale (smaller block time) check out litecoins [45% pool](

Yes, as I said, finding a massive warehouse could be used to prove **centralization**.


You ever notice that a lot of repairmen/plumbers/electricians are either independent contractors or part of a small business rather than working for some massive company? It's because there is a huge overhead in managing all those people and there isn't too much benefit in managing them. The industry has decentralized to thousands of small companies and/or individuals because there is a diseconomy of scale.
The same could happen with Bitcoin if we tweak its incentive structure in the right way.

[nMajorityEnforceBlockUpgrade]( is the nRequired argument in [isSuperMajority]( so nRequired is 750 for this upgrade (and all others).
However, the [supermajority check]( requires the block version to be &gt;=4 to check whether there is a super-majority (otherwise it would be wasted computation since you won't hit the 751/1001 threshold on a block that isn't V4). This check passes the previous block index, which means starting at the **previous** block it will iterate through 1000 blocks, checking whether they are &gt;= V4.
In short, you check whether a block is &gt;= V4, and then tell the isSuperMajority function to check the last 1000 blocks to see if you have 750/1000. If this is true, you have the last 750/1000 PLUS the current V4 block you found, making it 751/1001.
You seem to be asking why not make it 750 instead. The reason probably is that it doesn't really make a difference. You could either check the current block twice, or you could subtract one from nRequired.

Yes of course.


Doubtful. If you are trying to say you want to kick "centralized" China out by increasing their bandwidth requirements that doesn't work. They are already increasing network trust and centralization by trusting other miners SPV proofs because of the bandwidth problem. You will see this more.
It is quite clear that increasing the cost of being a fully validating miner reduces the number of fully validating miners, and causes miners to trust the validation to other parties, which centralizes the entire system.
Increasing bandwidth requirements for validating doesn't get rid of China, it just causes them to not validate, or geographically centralize. It is absurd to want to strain the system in order to kick out validating miners.


That isn't how economies of scale work. If processor sales doubled next year, I wouldn't pull a semiconductor fablab out of my ass and compete. Intel would eat up the market.


Not really relevant. My point is you are absurdly defining spam in a way that if it were applied to email, it would be anything that gets into your inbox.

a majority of miners do things together regularly. They are called softforks, and they work because the blocks the miners produce are a subset of valid blocks which means their newly minted funds are still valid to all the merchants running full nodes.
The problem arises when too many people are running SPV clients. To SPV clients, virtually all blocks (discluding those with an invalid header) are "valid". This gives miners an absurd amount of freedom to choose how they are going to structure the block. Be it stealing funds, arbitrarily inflating, or one of the other many possible changes, they can make blocks of that form valid to SPV clients.


Unfortunately "pointing their clients at honest full nodes" requires trusting some information source to tell you that the full node you're pointing at is lying so you can ignore the longest chain. In effect you are allowing this person to choose the valid blockchain, and at this point you might as well not even run an SPV client because you're not using the security assumption "the tallest blockchain is the correct blockchain", you're using the security assumption "the tallest blockchain that this person approves of is correct".
If we had fraud proofs, that could be a valid way to avoid these problems, but we don't so it isn't.

The way you are presenting this is backwards. Miners don't mine transactions to get them out of peoples mempools, the mempools policies are designed to only include transactions that are likely to be mined.

Dial up has nothing to do with this. 2kb/s is just a parameter that effects mining decentralization and number of SPV clients.

The problem the blockchain solves is consensus. It designates which transactions are "first". While not in the blockchain there is no knowing which transaction is first because the communication between nodes isn't instantaneous (not to mention that miners can just choose a different transaction for free).
To give a practical example, lets say I connect to a miners node and to many nodes close to miners. I calculate that after node A sees my transaction, it only takes 1 second for a miner to see it. So, when node A sees my transaction and tries relaying it to me, I immediately send my doublespend to the miner. 
To the miner, it looks like my doublespend was broadcasted first, but that isn't the case.

There isn't much you can do to make SPV more secure by itself. You could have UTXO commitments and make the security slightly stronger, but SPV clients will always be vulnerable to fake conf attacks and other attacks.
Of course you could increase the security of full nodes and SPV clients by making the mining ecosystem more secure. The flip side of UTXO commitments is they create another pressure to centralize mining. One of the main reasons small blockers (at least me) want small blocks is because of the unhealthy mining ecosystem.

we should have left Bitcoin in a state that allowed massive inflation (which was fixed twice through softforks),
and the ability to steal anyones money (which was fixed through a softfork), 
and perhaps we should have left the blockchain in a state where two clients of the same version may disagree on the tallest valid blockchain (which was fixed through a softfork),
and of course we shouldn't have fixed the problem where transactions could be redundant and even spent multiple times (which was fixed through a softfork),
and of course, we should never look into future improvements of Bitcoin that may require a softfork.

Almost every altcoin is made in order to transfer money from [greater fools]( to the creator, the early adopters and lesser fools... and it works.
There is no requirement that your altcoin pass a security audit, that it have reasonable security assumptions, or that it even does what the author claims it says it does. The only requirement is that it is advertised to do something and the creator can trick people into believing it does that thing. There are only arguably 2-3 altcoins that can reasonably be considered innovative, the rest don't follow the security model they suggest they have, or have any improvement over Bitcoin.
The [Keynsian Beauty Contest]( allows it to be speculated on based on how others believe others will view how others view the advertising.
It also creates very bad incentives. Because there is much money to be made through influencing people into adopting it, deceptive people will raid discussion forums and manipulate the votes in order to pump their currency (you likely will see this effect first hand in this thread).

It is censoring transactions in the sense that you won't use your resources to relay them, and using your resources in the way that you want to use them is perfectly acceptable in Bitcoin when it comes to non-consensus stuff.

No, these two requirements are combined. It must both be valid **AND** most work. "chain-with-most-work rule", one which you are implying would bring you to consensus with the XT chain, requires you to not validate and therefore that rule only applies to SPV clients.


Clearly here I am talking about them being reliable in the sense that they don't accept blocks of arbitrary form as you suggested.

You're not aware that blocks are produced in poisson distribution? Blocks can take less than a second to produce, and whenever you reduce the blocktime, you increase proportionally the probability that a competing block will be produced due to latency. You have an absurdly low standard if you're trying to make it so "just some" of the blocks aren't orphaned (which is what would be accomplished by having a block time equal to the latency).


Yes, it harms Bitcoin, which maintains the currency they are paid in.

Interesting, 0.09 megabytes per second (723Kb/s) to transfer to 50% of hashing power.
I am curious how much of this is due to actual bandwidth and not ping (the slop is mentioned, but what is the intercept?).
Anyways, you can do a calculation to find the cost of a 200 bytes transaction and the cost of an additional MB larger block:
~25BTC per block rewarded
10 seconds for the median miner to get the block at 1MB
600 seconds per block
25BTC * 10 seconds / 600 seconds  = 0.41BTC per MB.
The average feerate right now seems to be hovering around 0.40BTC per MB, so market forces seem to have brought us to some equilibrium.
Another important thing to point out is that large mining warehouses have nearly zero latency between their miners, so the larger portion of the hashrate they have, the more they will earn relative to other miners with more latency between them.

When OP_RETURN used to always cause the transaction to return true and allowed anyone to steal anyone elses funds.

Like I said, 2kb/s is just a parameter with the side effects I described. Wanting less than 2kb/s means they are accepting a fee increase in exchange for greater network security.


I'm not sure. A billion people using bitcoin multiple (e.g. 5) times per day means you need to validate 60k transactions per second which means likely somewhere between 100k and 500k sigops per second. In order to process that you need a cluster costing on the scale of $100k, and a service plan allows for 50TB/month download.
Maybe it will increase, maybe it will decrease (the general trend right now is a block size increase means a full node count decrease), but nothing in my comment relates to the absolute number of full nodes. This:

That is true of Bitcoin transactions which pay sufficient fees as well. If you decided to not pay a fee, your transaction likely wouldn't be confirmed.

Yes, it is fine if they are all running the same consensus implementation, though those in OPs picture aren't. Perhaps he should have used "Bitcoin Core", "Bitcoin-ljr" and "other system using libconsensus".
I think there is a big problem on this subreddit of confusing what decentralization is though. Everyone having a uniform set of rules isn't the same as everyone having a "centralized" set of rules. The fact that the set of rules are distributed between thousands and agreed upon by thousands means it is decentralized.

No, your calculations do not. I can't tell if you're trolling or an idiot at this point, but with 1MB/block you are capped at 100KB/minute. It costs an incredible amount of money to spam the blockchain with 2MB/minute because you have to manage to produce 2 blocks per minute in order to do so, which requires 20x the network hashrate that was available at last difficulty. This eventually becomes exponentially more difficult because if you produce a block every 30 seconds, the difficulty will adjust and multiply by 20, meaning you will now have to use 400 times the hashrate to produce at that rate. With 20MB blocks you just need to prouce blocks to spam the blockchain at 2MB/minute, or not even that, just create a bunch of transactions with fees for miners.
In short, spamming 2MB/minute on a 1MB/block blockchain costs as much as multiplying the network hashrate by 20. (a few hundred million dollars)
Spamming 2MB/minute on a 20MB blockchain only costs ~$10,000/day if miners include the tx at a normal-high feerate.


Why do you keep talking about the mempool. My comment wasn't that mempool spamming attacks are made less of a concern due to the cap, it was that blockchain spamming attacks are made less of a concern due to the cap:


Perhaps the issue stems from the fact that you don't know that the mempool isn't the blockchain?

The problem is that if everyone is running SPV clients except miners, the only "hard forks" to the SPV users are changes to the block header, everything else is a soft fork. Soft forks are not expensive to miners.


Then you are trusting the Bitcoin economy to that poster, Reddit and the group that produced the news. That isn't a fraud proof, it's an unproven fraud **rumor**.


Oh sure, anyone running a full node is fine, and if most people ran full nodes rather than accepting SPV security, Peter Todd wouldn't even have the complaint.


These security assumptions are kind of wonky. SPV clients don't operate on the principal of "I must find a full node that is honest", they operate on the principal of "the most-worked-on blockchain is the one I will use". If you are going to ignore the work of the blockchain, and the validity of the blockchain, all you have left is trusting someone to tell you what is correct. This is basically the banking structure we have today.


The thing is, there may be no "honest" fork. Everyone running SPV clients is delegating to miners the authority to entirely determine the rules of transaction validity. This means miners may collectively agree to change the rules a certain way if there aren't enough full nodes running merchants demanding that transaction validity fall within a certain rule-set.

This isn't a valid or sound argument. My statement was generalized to all transactions, "legitimate" (which cannot be tested for) or otherwise, so even if your statement were true, it wouldn't falsify what I wrote. However it isn't true. With a large enough number of transactions, DoS of many nodes is possible.


I'm not talking about transactions that don't follow the rules, I'm talking about transactions that do follow consensus rules, but are very inexpensive for an attacker to broadcast, but expensive for the entire network to process.


There are many transactions that many nodes would immediately ignore and not relay further. There are also transactions which all miners drop because of an insufficient fee despite the fact that some may have absurd mempool rules. Is it logical for a user to keep a transaction that will never be confirmed in their mempool? Of course not.
In other words, while the transaction may exist somewhere in some form, it isn't relevant to the consensus system.


You really can't make any objective judgements about the Bitcoin system period based on the mempool. All that matters is the blockchain, the mempool is just a tool for relaying transactions to miners.

It's not about how many run full nodes as much as it is about how many are increasing attack profitability by running SPV clients.


If you're proposing a system in which two years later blocks are allowed to be 16MB and the subsidy is 12.5MB, you should defend such a system. Assuming the average fee-rate stays the same, full blocks implies fees are 12% of the reward, and this is in just **two years**. 12% is **very** large in a perfect competition. This is problematic in the very near future, not even down the road.


If the larger players are making more money disproportionately, that leads to the larger players getting bigger, not decentralization. The difficulty adjusts itself, so the rewards changing aren't very relevant, but the contents of the rewards changing, especially if only large players have access to a portion of the rewards, is relevant.


Is it fair to assume that you also believe that if someone wanting to advertise to you via email pays to reverse engineer an anti-spam system and it gets to you it also isn't spam? No, it is just spam that wasn't caught.


The entire reason we have network rules is to prevent miners from defining the system. If you want to make an altcoin in which miners can reward themselves infinite currency, steal from others wallets, etc, then fine. But please don't push such a system on Bitcoin.
Defining network rules isn't centralization, someone has to implement the rules, but they are only proposals until they are accepted by the decentralized set of users in the network. The fact that a developer said "we're going to fix the problem in which miners can reward themselves millions of Bitcoins" and users accepted the rules isn't centralization. The fact that a developer said "we're going to fix the problem where one user can steal another users funds through a bug in Bitcoin" and users accepted his rule isn't centralization.
**We aren't ruled by miners, miners are subject to the validity rules of Bitcoin users if they want their block rewards to be spendable. Being that we, the users of Bitcoin, have the ability to define the network rules as we please, I propose we fix these problems in a way that benefits us, and only benefits the miners .**


Your argument was that Satoshi approved of Gavin so we should follow his lead. What Satoshi said should be disregarded unless it is evidenced, and by extent, what Gavin says should be disregarded unless evidenced. His approval by Satoshi is irrelevant to the merits of BIP101.

Yes, this is how a softfork works.
In a hardfork the shorter chain from un-upgraded miners is your blockchain that you recognize. In a softfork any chain made by unupgraded miners is guaranteed to not end up the consensus chain in the future.


In a softfork the chains made by un-upgraded miners are only recognized by outdated full node clients, which eventually will gain consensus. In a hardfork the chains made by un-upgraded miners are only recognized by outdated full node clients, which will NEVER gain consensus (unless the hardfork is reversed).
SPV woes are a symptom of the mining ecosystem being problematic. A softfork doesn't lend to this much except introduces the possibility that a 0.01% miner that may not have upgraded will produce an invalid block without intentionally attacking. If a 0.01% miner can cause serious problems, then the softfork isn't the issue, the mining ecosystem is. After all, the security assumption behind Bitcoin isn't "99.99% of miners will be nice and honest".

If you don't care about transactions getting into blocks, then this whole point is moot. Unconfirmed transactions hold no weight and I assumed when you said "die", that you were being reasonable and talking about the "death" of the only outcome a Bitcoin user cares about: the transaction being confirmed. Evicting these transactions which will never confirm is just the logical thing for a full node operator to do.
The backlog doesn't matter if you evict from it. A trillion unconfirmed transactions is fine as long as your client is designed to get rid of them before your memory fills up.

After subsidies level off, mining is just going to expend as much energy as a user pays in fees. If I pay a dollar, a dollar in electricity is going to be used.
I could use a trusty currency, which theoretically could use significantly less electricity, but because I value trustlessness, and believe it benefits me, I will pay for the energy burned.
The same argument can be used for any other act that burns energy. I want warm pizza even though cold pizza is better for the environment. It isn't a waste because it benefits me. I want to visit my friends rather than call them, even though it burns many dollars in energy. It isn't wasteful because I benefit.
Almost every action, purchase, etc has a cost and decreases the availability of scarce resources. We could ban NASCAR and all that energy would be saved, we could ban hair dryers and any energy used would be saved. If we're not going to consider the benefit these actions have for humans and have simply the goal of not using resources we should just sit in a dark room all day.

You are still confused about how transaction relaying works. I have already explained that only a subset of valid transactions are accepted to the mempool and relayed, yet you continue to insist that all valid transactions are relayed.
This section of the code explains the limitations on a transaction being accepted to the mempool including but not limited to validity:
@_date: 2015-10-29 11:38:53


In any reasonable Bitcoin client a subset of transactions will be ignored, unless you want a DoS attack vector.
A backlog will get larger as the feerate decreases and smaller as the feerate increases. As always, if you pay an insufficient fee your transaction will not be confirmed.  Your title seems to stem from a misconception, you broadcasting a transaction isn't in any way a guarantee of the transaction being recorded.


The whole point of the blockchain is consensus. There is no consensus and there is no "distorted view on the world" when a transaction is merely in the mempool.


That may be a problem if the set of transactions nodes will relay is excessively diverse in different aspects (script types allowed, feerate, num outputs/inputs, num sigops, etc), but if only one dimension is changed, then you can easily comply. It's a bit misleading to call these "rules", these aren't "rules", they are relay policies and relay policy changes don't break consensus.

You can assert that, but it isn't that hard to read the white paper and understand that it is a trustless consensus. Since you don't appear aware, consensus in this context is everyone in agreement.

They actually should be fixable with a softfork. The thing is **no one cares** to fix them. The bugs don't cause any harm to anyone other than those using consensus re-implementations, and there is no way of knowing the two clients have identical consensus (without some advancement in computer science), so you almost certainly aren't fixing the "bug" when you softfork anyways.

Yes, all consensus re-implementations maintain consensus until some transaction, block, or set of blocks appears.


Of course I don't... because that's not what consensus means. If 75% of miners could redefine what Bitcoin was, then we wouldn't be using Bitcoin, we'd be using some weaker currency that miners can inflate as much as they want, and doesn't have the same security benefits Bitcoin has.

[Better explanation than my summary](
Monero uses ring signatures. You are able to join a massive anonymity set cheaply if you do it right. I don't believe Monero is a scam, but I don't believe it is a very safe investment either.
Dash is a cryptocurrency that pretended it didn't use coinjoins and sold itself as an "anonymous" currency, until some decent coinjoin implementations came about for Bitcoin. Then the creator started pretending it could securely perform zero conf transactions out of fear of its only supposed value proposition (anonymity) being beaten. Dash is definitely a scam and should be avoided.

Tracking every time I tried to ask them about the statement and they neither 
A) retracted, nor
B) explained how else their statement could be interpreted
Based on this evidence it becomes clear that Novauri will make incorrect statements to promote their company, but ignore their existence after being presented with the statements.


So is this you claiming that you will match 50% of all customer funds in a reserve?
You, representing your company, are claiming that it wouldn't be a failure unless 100% of the customers funds are stolen, so surely you could pay us back if 50% log in since 50% &lt; 100%, which would require 50% of all customer funds be matched by you, right?
[distraction pointing out Coinbase only has 3% insured. Let it be known that when Novauri promises X, they are promising X as long as it isn't going beyond what Coinbase does.](
Ignoring the fact that they wouldn't need to log in all at the same time, "every customer logs in all at once and sent bitcoin all at the same time" is you indirectly saying that "every user suffers a loss", "[unless that happens] it would never cause a catastrophic failure we could not repay" means that is the ONLY failure you could not pay.
In other words you are claiming that "every user suffering a loss is the only failure we couldn't pay for".
This means that if 99% of users suffer losses you should be able to pay them back.
Is this because you have reserves of 99% of users coins or because you have insurance to that amount?
[Says I incorrectly interpreted the statement but doesn't provide how else the statement could possibly be interpreted, then proceeds to pitch his company](
Upon reading this, I was hoping for an explanation about how the statement that you will be able to 'pay back your customers even if nearly all of them lose their money' could possibly mean anything other than that YOU HAVE A WAY TO PAY THEM BACK. Unfortunately you decided to pitch your company instead.

That is thanks to memory and computer storage.


By nature of fiat your money has to leave your hands.


Because when you are invoking trust in someone to handle information relevant to the blockchain (for example enforce theft laws) there is no loss in having them manage the data themselves too.


Because proof of reserves can do the same, faster and more efficiently.


Hmm? What does regulation have to do with this? BTC-e is unregulated?


When you say "proof of crypto reserves" it seems like you're injecting the word crypto to qualify it for whatever your definition of crypto is. Cryptography isn't something you can have a reserve of.
Proof of reserve does work. Your argument that it doesn't work for things that involve trust like gold apply to a blockchain too.

Yes, the wikipedia article doesn't mention encryption. I was commenting on you stating that encryption made read-onlyness possible:




I wasn't commenting on their bad design, I was commenting on how bad of a design using encryption to make something read only would be as you suggested.


The processor I linked can encrypt and decrypt data at 69,680Mbps.
No it will not be slower.
Yes, it will be, it would have to be infinity Mbps for it to take 0 seconds to encrypt and decrypt. I will not even discuss this, this should be obvious.


Lol, no. One is a relational database that is local, while the other is a distributed hash table. I can't even understand how one would come to the conclusion that they are very similar.


A hundred hops at 1000ns comes out to 100,000ns or 0.0001 seconds. You then add the .0001 seconds to the distance traveled in km divided by 299,792.458km/s.
WTF? I don't even know how to respond to this. I was talking about light speed constraints and you talk about hopping?
How about I simplify this for you. The speed of light is 300,000km/s, the circumfrence of earth is 40,000km. Light going to the other side of earth and back can take 40,000/300,000 seconds or 1/7th of a second. 100x1/7 = 14 seconds of latency.


It is obvious that latency is a problem.

In a hardfork old clients are guaranteed to never have correct information once the hardfork is activated.
In a softfork old clients are guaranteed to eventually have correct information once the softfork is activated.
It is silly to argue "we should make it even more hazardous to not upgrade so people upgrade". If you aren't going to upgrade during a softfork then that is a risk you are accepting.
Also, softforks are much easier to deploy, you just need a mining super-majority to add the new feature, while hardforks require a mining AND economic super-majority and to prevent problems.
Not to mention that hardforks centralize Bitcoin and are a major risk because you must now trust the some combination of miners and a spokesperson to determine which new set of rules you will follow.

That isn't what valid means or does. Valid transactions are transactions which follow consensus rules. A subset of valid transactions are relayed to other nodes. Either your understanding of how the system works is wrong or your understanding of terminology around the system is wrong.


I never said free transactions aren't allowed, I said that miners drop some transactions due to insufficient fees, this is a spam prevention rule and most nodes follow it as well. Why do you keep quoting what I wrote then arguing against something I didn't write? 


This is wrong. You may have the data somewhere, but there isn't now and never will there be a guarantee that your transaction will make it into a block.
You can talk about your personal mempool, and you could change your clients minrelayfee and other rules so you could create billions of 0 fee dust transactions in your own mempool, but they aren't going to make it into the blockchain.


No, this is wrong. You don't need to agree to a central authorities eviction rules, but you can accept someones eviction rules and use them yourself. Arguing that this would be using centralized decision making on what should be evicted is like arguing that you are using centralized decision making when you run a client that doesn't allow someone to send you 10 billion transactions spending the same output.

Part of the network gets one solution and part of it gets another. This happens 1% - 5% of the time (last time I looked at the statistics). Whichever block has a new block found on top of it first becomes the recognized blockchain.
As the time it takes to propagate a block increases, due to factors like larger block size, miners having slower connections, etc, the probability of this issue occurring increases.
The reason 6 confirmations is considered to be "safe" is because it makes the probability of an accident like this, as well as malicious attacks causing issues, very unlikely.


It would be very inconvenient and new users would need to manually connect to nodes that would act as seed nodes. Not in any way something that is a threat to Bitcoins integrity, however.


Each block references a previous block recursively until you hit the genesis block. The blockchain on which the most work was done becomes the blockchain that the nodes and miners recognize. 
The Bitcoin whitepaper will give you a basic technical understanding of how Bitcoin works.

Miners have previously taken on the task of fixing consensus. v0.7 clients broke consensus with other v0.7 clients. This led to miners softforking so all v0.7 clients could achieve consensus with each other. Of course this isn't desirable because it requires miners to act quickly and possibly go against monetary incentives.
If we have bitcoina, bitcoinb, bitcoinc, bitconind, and bitcoine, there will be some set of rules shared by all of them, and almost certainly edge cases for each of them. As soon as a miner mines a block compatible with, say, bitcoina and bitcoinc,  the network will be split pretty bad. To fix this, miners would likely softfork to a ruleset that disallows that edge case from happening where a block was valid in bitcoina and bitcoinc, but invalid elsewhere.
It's basically whack-a-mole because there are an infinite number of possible block-utxo-set combinations. As explained in the link, getting it right isn't easy to do or verify. What would be best is all five clients using [the same consensus library]( and **then** it would be completely acceptable for them to make any changes they wish. A new logo, a new networking protocol (not a new consensus protocol), a new wallet type, different relay policy, different transaction types, etc.

It is similar to how nodes could run Bitcoin Not-limited (no miner subsidy limit) and still follow the longest chain. However, nodes that enforced too small miner a subsidy limit would eventually be forked off the network if they refused to follow consensus and increase their limits.
Yes, it is clear that there are ways you can make it so your node is always on the tallest blockchain, in fact you could just run an SPV client and you would **always** be on the tallest blockchain. However, the goal is NOT to hand over the power to the miners to define the tallest blockchain, it is for the Bitcoin users to retain the power of defining the blockchains rules.

You didn't respond to it. Paragraph one is you explaining that you wrongly think it won't happen. Paragraph two is you asserting that you would notice the change. Paragraph three is you stating that your team pwomises not to be naughty. Paragraph four is where you stated incorrectly that the previous paragraphs were the requirements for an attack, this is where I hoped you would address your claim. Paragraph five is where you continue to describe requirements for all of your users to lose funds.
Paragraph six is where you come up with some inane analogy when what I'm really doing is more analogous to making it publicly known that a bank promised to have a certain money in reserve when in fact they have no money in reserve.
Paragraph seven is where you once again say I'm taking what you said out of context without explaining what it actually meant in context. Paragraph eight is where you end without actually addressing the claim.
Anyways, I think it's clear that you're beyond the point of promoting a legitimate company. It is quite obvious that you are either malicious or ignorant, but likely a little of both.

Yes, if you remove a constraint of something that is a problem, then it may be solved. You just changed the criteria of the halting problem to only include code which is not turing complete. However this doesn't solve the original problem.
In the same way you could consider the sybil problem in the context of incentivizing Bitcoin nodes to be already solved in cases where everyone is honest.
However, in cases where your code is turing complete and Bitcoin network participants may be dishonest, you haven't solved either of the problems.

To avoid redundant babbling, I am only going to explain how you're flipping back and forth between your claims to avoid admitting you won't have such a reserve. I want you to "get it". Your service can be attacked, I have described attack vectors.
You claimed that if an attack where the wallet is turned into private key stealing Javascript were executed then "unless every customer logs in all at once and sent bitcoin all at the same time (about as likely as winning the lottery 100 times in a row), it would never cause a catastrophic failure we could not repay."
Ignoring the fact that they wouldn't need to log in all at the same time, "every customer logs in all at once and sent bitcoin all at the same time" is you indirectly saying that "every user suffers a loss", "[unless that happens] it would never cause a catastrophic failure we could not repay" means that is the ONLY failure you could not pay.
In other words you are claiming that "every user suffering a loss is the only failure we couldn't pay for".
This means that if 99% of users suffer losses you should be able to pay them back.
Is this because you have reserves of 99% of users coins or because you have insurance to that amount?


It is shameful you consider me trying to hold your company to its word as an attack.

No, the incentive to attack for an honest person isn't sufficient. An honest person doing such an attack can't steal so there is no benefit. If you put the salary of a security auditor, maybe $50k for 6 months of coding an attack, then an attack would be performed at salary.

Archiving this comment by MrMadden in which he claims Novauri will have nearly 100% of customer funds on reserve:


The key here is that your hypothetical malicious coin-stealing wallet code has to be downloaded when a user logs in and wouldn't capture the private keys until the user entered the wallet password. That password is only required to send or sell.
So unless every customer logs in all at once and sent bitcoin all at the same time (about as likely as winning the lottery 100 times in a row), it would never cause a catastrophic failure we could not repay. Even if someone pulled off this ridiculously difficult fraud in our company, it would only get them a few customers' bitcoin. Why the hell would that evil criminal mastermind developer work for Novauri, when they can go work at a competitor and steal 100% of the bitcoin for as much trouble?

Colored coins may be useful for this, but ownership only is useful to the extent the government will help enforce the ownership. You have to trust the government to enforce theft laws and at that point I wonder if it is useful to have ownership certificates not managed by the government.


What? No. Putting them on a blockchain doesn't accomplish anything that publishing a list of trades with a signature can't. The blockchain is a trustless consensus tool. You don't need consensus to construct a proof they're lying. Along with that, there is nothing preventing them from creating fake trades that they put in the blockchain anyways.


The blockchain doesn't ensure fairness anymore than a published centralized logs + a fraud proof can't.

* A transaction with a much lower fee will likely be confirmed in a day.
* A transaction with a fee barely meeting min-relay-fee, but with a very low fee-per-byte will be confirmed in 25 days. 
* A transaction with an even lower fee will likely never be confirmed.
What 25 days is measuring is how long it would take to measure a transaction in which the creator decided to set the fee barely at the standard spam prevention limit. 
The real concern is the growth of the mempool which can be prevented by mempool evictions.

Both their research papers for being "an anonymous coin" and "instant transactions" are laughable, even more so his video "demoing" instantx.
The master nodes create an economy of scale and give advantages to miners running master nodes and master nodes who mine, not to mention that master nodes don't actually have to mix for anyone to make money.
Instantx is just a joke. I'm not sure what's changed since the original paper came out, but any set of 5 masternodes were able to halt the currency in its tracks. The entire consensus model is based on a lack of understanding of the problem Bitcoin originally solved.

Indeed, this is why we need more users of open source wallets which require less trust, especially full nodes. Blockchain.info itself is probably the biggest liability. A very large number of people use it and they have shown themselves to be incompetent, and arguably malicious.
And those running full nodes need to [verify the integrity of their software]( This means that you can see, with proof, which gitian builders approve of the new version.
Of course, the only way to guarantee that the code isn't malicious, even in the case that 100% of gitian builders are evil, is to become an expert in C++, cryptography and Bitcoin, then audit all new commits. Of course this isn't feasible for most people, so trusting that there will be one whistleblower among the many gitian builders is the next best thing.

The blockchain is a datastructure, not a protocol. I don't see how you propose we prevent someone from making fake trade volume. The blockchain isn't some magical tool that makes any data in there honest, you can easily trade between fake accounts you own.


Could you give a source on that? A proof of reserves can prove reserves to the extent a blockchain can.

Have you done any research on BigTable and databases like it?
Their architecture is distributed, but it is a relational database and the integrity is based on Googles trust in itself so an ineffecient DHT lookup isn't needed. There are a myriad of tasks hash tables are incredibly ineffecient for and DHTs tend to have that same efficiency * log(N).

Since we don't know what percentage of the hash power the biggest miner has, the limit would have to be pretty low to be safe. That seems like an unnecessary constraint when the lotto can be done in a way that can't be manipulated by miners.


For more than two parties you may need a softfork to allow OP_XOR (there may be some way to do it without though). Until then, the lottery would be just a high risk bet involving a single other party to simulate a lottery. It would be pretty practical. Even with multiple parties it can be made practical.

I did, did you read my post?


You are aware of the delete key right? You just called me a FUDder for not "quantifying" your risks immediately before recognizing that I described the risks. What makes it even more confusing is that you don't know how to use the word quantify.


"OMG someone is pointing out that I am making fraudulent claims, they must be a competitor!!!!"


1) We will be inspecting the files and traffic as an audit process on a regular basis, including after every release when a developer would introduce this issue for deployment, specifically looking for changes to this code?
2) Power users WILL inspect their local code and traffic (you can verify that a mysterious evil Novauri developer hasn't implanted malicious code for you to download by inspecting the file and looking at the traffic it sends)?,
3) The risk vs. reward doesn't add up? What you describe would require the same amount of internal collusion as stealing the entire cold wallet balance of a competitor.
1) A good auditing process puts you at the level of a well run web-wallet like Coinbase. Remember, we are talking about your original claim along the lines of your website being theft-proof. 
2) Your security assumption is that a set of volunteer security experts will audit your code for free every time you make an update and hopefully report to the community if there is something before too many users have logged in?


3) So you're now admitting that it is just as easy to steal from your customers as a competitors, good. Now we can get down to the reality: they can steal from any customer that logs in before you or some security auditor finds out that your website is distributing coin stealing scripts. In the cases of other Bitcoin websites this was months. What is the reward? Probably a majority of your users funds, though not 100%.


Your argument seems to be "my team will stop evil code". If the users can't trust places like MtGox and coinbase to either not be evil or not stop attackers, they probably can't trust your service either.


You claimed ~100%, but I used 50% as an example. Are you regretting that now?


Are we throwing "mission impossible" in there to make it seem like your system is more secure? Why not call the MtGox insider/hacker a "mission impossible" developer.


Then perhaps you shouldn't make fraudulent claims that  "unless every customer [has a theft] it would never cause a catastrophic failure we could not repay." Regarding my previous comment, "every customer" is what 100% refers to.


This is good and I appreciate that your company does this. It is much better that you guys not have a wallet at all though.

Of course you can't prove someone has gold reserves behind a colored coin. Like I said, "A proof of reserves can prove reserves to the extent a blockchain can."


Yes, adding a universal fee should make it slightly difficult to have artificially high volume, but it is known that they have no fees. If they wanted fees and wanted their trade volume to be more representative then they could add the fees. Since they are choosing to not have a fee, having a blockchain doesn't accomplish much because they can spawn fiat out of thin air and trade with themselves.

Yep, that's what I expected, continuing to ignore the actual claim. Your claim assumes there is a significant monetary loss. You can't say something along the lines of "we can pay you back if you lose your money" then say "oh, we don't have the means to pay you back because we don't foresee that happening". That isn't an explanation about how you would pay someone back if they lost their money.
Yes, I understand that you have a limited understanding of security and think this is impossible, but that doesn't change the fact that you claimed you can pay customers back for loss when in fact you can't.
Anyways, you obviously aren't retracting your claim. I hope your company fails before you lose anyones money.
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:50:59


Some teams advertise that as being true, but in reality many things require trust and cannot be autonomous. They can obscure the fact that they're not autonomous by having contracts within the blockchain involving trust be executed, but in the end I don't think there are many things that can be done without trust.
This is why I asked people to name examples, saying "almost all" doesn't give me anything to talk about. Can McDonalds be autonomous? No. Can Amazon? probably. Can an individual Amazon store? No.

When you used it to describe something that doesn't need encryption and advertised it as a feature. E.g. "here is my new video game that comes with encryption".


If a system relies on encryption to maintain the integrity of local data, it is **very** poorly made. It shouldn't need encryption to be read only.


It isn't massively slower, but it is slower. You have an unnecessary computation.


My claim wasn't about how much the average user downloads, it just is pointing out the flawed thinking of "the internet is fast, therefore everything using the internet will be fast" when in reality a queries involving talking to many peers in series is slow.


Google doesn't work by having every search phrase in a hash table. It is much more complicated.


You can only reduce latency so much. If you have 100 TCP connections in series required to perform some search query and you have the fastest possible hardware, you still will need to wait up to 15 seconds due to speed of light constraints.
You can have a suboptimal search engine that relies on finding the intersection of results between all keywords after looking up all the keywords and that may be semi-efficient, but for complex search queries, centralization will be much faster because you have much less latency.

Nice try. That just makes it so a fraction of your team (those who can commit to production) can perform the attack I mentioned... it's still trusty even in the best case and I'm sure many other web wallets where you don't control your keys have the same release procedures.


Nice try. Such an attack doesn't have to immediately steal money, it could just slowly collect private keys. You using a very dumb attacker as an example for your security assumptions doesn't give me much confidence in your company.


So is this you claiming that you will match 50% of all customer funds in a reserve? You, representing your company, are claiming that it wouldn't be a failure unless *100%* of the customers funds are stolen, so surely you could pay us back if 50% log in since 50% &lt; 100%, which would require 50% of all customer funds be matched by you, right?


I don't know, but if your security assumption for your website is that no one malicious will work there then you might as well just hold our funds yourself since we would be approximately as secure.
