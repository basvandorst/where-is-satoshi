Is that worth getting in to or are we talking about 50 cents profit a day? No idea how that works. I have plenty of coins or dollars i can lend out.

End of central bank power? Please explain. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:57:21
Yes, that's just bad. Why do the cultists refuse to understand that stuff like this works against them?
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:02:33
Nothing to see here. Not our problem. Bitcoin works as intended. 
Am i doing this right?
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:25:28
Well considering they are on strike because of the fees they have to pay i somehow doubt they're gonna switch to a currency that lost 80% of it's value this year. 
If you downvote me then please man up and at least tell me where i'm wrong. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:38:16
Even more reason why it will go to the mainpage. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:25:48
They should've used Bitcoin? Or what is your message exactly? The suspense is killing me!
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:45:46
Do you really not get the message? It's been posted 5 times already and one of those posts is on top of the mainpage. People can stop posting about it. 
You can avoid this by taking a quick look before posting or really just use some common sense and realize you are very likely not the first person to post this.

We just dropped 20 dollars. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:52:24
Very interesting. Thanks a lot. 
Yes i'm sure this comment was worth your downvote. 
This place is retarded. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:35:34
5 people already posted this off topic news. Of which one post is on top of the mainpage. 
Please just stop. This is a Bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:15:39
Why is this posted here?
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:47:25
I'm not even gonna explain how flawed your argument is. You either won't get it or refuse to get it. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:15:45
The network can't handle the amount of transactions anymore. Which is a HUGE problem which gets completely ignored here. As you can see from this post for instance. 
Posts about an unrelated currency crashing gets to the mainpage while this quickly gets buried. 
They want Bitcoin to go mainstream but on a busy day the network already overloads. 
And by busy i mean 0.0001 of what it would do if mainstream. 
This sub is really great at pointing out problems with other currencies but post about a problem Bitcoin has and get downvoted to oblivion. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:44:31
Riiight, so there really is no problem. Silly me. Everything is fine!
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:21:33
If this, if that. 
If the cc fees wouldn't be so high there would be no problem. 
If i would win the lottery i would be a millionaire. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:57:53
You got downvoted for answering a question honestly. Which is not allowed here unless it's pro-bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:31:35
No idea. Why are you asking me?
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:56:03
That still doesn't explain your title, sorry. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:02:06
What the hell? So posting a simple fact now is considered trolling? This place gets more crazy by the day. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:25:40
Oooooh right. Got it. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:34:17
Why would you buy now? It's been going down for a year. Nothing has changed so why would it suddenly stop today?
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:09:09
We're down 75 dollars compared to a week ago and about 1000 dollars compared to last year. 
1 small pump by traders and this whole sub gets completely delusional again. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:35:49
Did what?
