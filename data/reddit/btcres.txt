Why would you give attention to this if it repels you so? &gt;&lt;

Ah, so I completely misunderstood, sorry. I tuned into the video for a sec and heard some "yo" and saw a lot of caps, and thought to myself my time is better spend elsewhere :p

Actually, I would venture to say that a way of automatically actioning car rides would even become more relevant with self-driving cars, as the car will handle that as well, on the blockchain (along with many other IoT innovations). But yes, im sure you are right in the short term as well

IMO, it would have fallen entirely without blockchain. Internet + mesh nets should be more than sufficient

It's a process, not an event :)

I asked a similar question not too long ago. While I dont think any dedicated platform for just this exists, using  is an option :)

It's better than nothing in any case. It's incredible hard to monetize on that sort of labour in the current ecosystem online, as the vast majority does it for free. Make sure, it's visible as many places as possible :) The price seems fair though, too little and noone will take it serious. Where have you linked it to?

Let me know how it goes! I'm working on my master's thesis atm and hoping to be able to make a dime on in the same manner as you :)

The network appreciates your support :D

But I mean, where have you submitted / embedded the link onto? If you are serious about writing, you should probably get yourself a domain and put up a wordpress site for it, in addition to posting to different forums and subreddits, and communities. Give a taste of your writing and post the link. Release it for free in its entirety some time after, when you are ready to publish your next. So that you only try to monetize on your newest work at any given time. You will not make a lot of money, if any at all. If you doing it primarily to get better at writing, there's no downside to it :)
