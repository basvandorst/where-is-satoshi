Whoa dude, thx for that link! In the end loving humility always wins over. Glad you didn't rub it in peoples faces, I'm just glad you found BTC and are genuinely out for people's best.

Most relevant piece of information is that Bitcoin can be observed doubling every 8 months and "could" continue to do so until mass adoption. Was hoping for more meat in the article but it raises an interesting point that this is the first time a pattern has been measured not in a technology's computing power but in it's price.

Ha, I am honestly happy for you but you don't know what it's like to start with nothing and not have a government that will make that possible. Can you pay for me then?
