That’s interesting to hear. I’ve never been to South America (USA here) but I’ve been meaning to go to Argentina to explore the BTC environment there. Thing is, I’d rather not be arrested for exploring my curiosity :)

Do merchants openly request payments in BTC? Overall, what is public perception / awareness of crypto overall?
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:10:07
I’ve started buying BTC on my Cash App thanks to a lower transaction fee than Coinbase (and supporting Joe Rogans sponsor is an external influencer too)

I was simply saying that the name "Shadowstats" doesn't invoke legitimacy, but it's a cool site.
The bar here on the left cites that he uses 1980 and 1990 methodology that has since been amended to calculate inflation.

Check out  The name is a little conspiratorial, but they track inflation using older standards; like before they started using technological innovation and "bait &amp; switch" swaps to make the figure look lower.
By 1980ish standards, we're at something like 5-6%.

Key quote of the article: 
"We're building a register so that sellers can accept a credit card, so they can accept cash, so they can accept a cheque, so they can accept Bitcoin and so they can accept any form of payment that comes across the counter including future ones and burgeoning ones like Apple Pay," said Dorsey.

I love reading the comments just to gauge public perception of Bitcoin. It's amazing watching the narrative shift from "dis is stoopid munney!" - "This is a great technological breakthrough, but look, it'll never catch on."
As a serial early adopter, I've had to hold my nose through many comments sections, but Bitcoin is progressing exactly as it should in terms of Troll Opinion.

Bitcoin ATMs are a big deal. If people can dabble, a percentage of them will get involved. It's about PR and market adoption, not about massive purchases and investment.
Institutional money can be a huge impact. Look at the total market cap, and consider the dollar amounts that some of these organizations are working with. Then, consider that they'll likely plan to hold rather than trade, and you're looking at a noteworthy increase in the "basement" price of BTC.
Agreed on Gox and China.

Like they said above, it's a wild ride. I tiptoed in at $70, then went in much more at $105 when I knew that the Silk Road being busted wasn't actually that big of a deal.
Be sure to use Bitcoin! Spend bitcoins and simultaneously replenish them from Coinbase or an exchange. If you're buying and holding, you're just speculating from the sidelines. The more of us that spend, the faster we increase incentive for businesses to accept it, and the size of the market grows.

You clearly dig economics, so I don't need to invoke a review of Picketty's "Capital in the 21st Century."
Eyeroll all you want. Inflationary policy rewards those closest to the initial loans being made - aka financial industry fat cats. It hurts those furthest from the faucet - aka the overwhelming majority of humans.
The point is that the borrowers in question aren't people like you and I taking out a mortgage. It's power brokers that are dealing with billions or trillions of dollars between multi-nationals and governments. Those with significant capital (the already-rich) have access to essentially unlimited money; while most people simply save a little on their mortgage at the expense of significantly higher prices.
Saving is the basis for upward mobility. Borrowing is the basis for King-of-the-hill style inequality.

It's great watching the dialogue change. What is it, "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."
That second announcer, you could tell, was trying to do everything within his power to make sure that Bitcoin wasn't discussed on the show.
It's still too risky for CEO's to be like "Bitcoin, yeah!" - so they mask it vaguely. With every step in the ecosystem &amp; infrastructure, companies like this can be more bold and/or accepting.

Judging by the comments here, I don't think anyone actually has the sentiment you speak of. The straw man you speak of hasn't spoken yet...

Marketing professional here: How much is a good marketing campaign worth? The press and legitimacy that comes from TigerDirect and Overstock is worth WAY more than the sales that (may) have been directly sold for fiat.
Even if these figures multiplied, they're still a drop in the bucket compared to overall market cap, and therefore won't affect price any more than we see in a given 10 minute period, currently. The legitimacy provided clears the way for the next wave of users and businesses, and overall growth takes place.

Will ALL the Miracles be gone, then??

Agree with one caveat - tech moves faster today than it did in the 70s. It's very reasonable to compare your 40-year development to a modern 10- or 20-year development/social movement.

Based on what premise? Technology will be fine in a collapse. The infrastructure is already there. What infrastructure or economic failures would cause cell phone towers or copper wiring to cease functioning? They have cell phones and internet in sub-Saharan Africa.
If something happened so bad that our entire infrastructure went down, I'll opt for food and shelter before shiny, malleable metal. Until then, I'll plan you use BTC in post-dollar-reserve America.

It's likely strategic for him to stay quiet until someone in the industry moves, or until Square's BTC solution is ready for market. No need to signal to his competitors that they should be working on BTC, too.

Private insurance of exchanges provides the protection that's needed without unneeded regulation. 
I think the potential of this news rivals today's apple announcement at this phase in bitcoins progresseion.

Go home, grammar nazi. They're a small blog that's growing alongside the industry. It's the content at counts, and Coindesk is a nice centralized place to stay abreast of Bitcoin developments in a short amount of time. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 18:49:49
I agree with the sentiment, but unfortunately your equation doesn't consider that inflation has the ability to reach into your mattress.

Most commenters here assume two things:
1. Bitcoin mining participants and technology will lag behind Bitcoin adoption.
2. Cost of electricity will continue to be a problem.
Hypothetically, if a new piece of powerful, efficient mining hardware came out, would it not solve or seriously diminish this problem?
Or what about solar roadways (half joking, but half serious in terms of breakthrough)? What if electricity costs became a tertiary concern?
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:35:39
Hold your horses:
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:24:21
This is technically correct, but it brings up an adoption issue. Right now, for businesses, it simply makes sense to accept Bitcoin. Even if the overall cost is lower, people are stage-one thinkers and will balk at fees. Businesses need to pass on the savings to customers.

Anyone watching CNN now? I'm not seeing anything, but I'm on the west coast...

I agree totally. I also think there are a few points that reflect the issue with deflation.
- I make 3% on my checking account through my credit union. I have never, and will likely never, forego a purchase to earn the 3%.
- Technology is very deflationary, far more than the 3% I noted above. Still, TVs, smartphones, computers, tablets, and more continue to fly off the rack. The iPad Air just came out. I want one, and I'm considering getting one, even though I know it will lose 1/3 to 1/2 of it's value on the secondary market within 20 months.
- Deflation puts wage earners first. In our current system, prices rise until the lower class nearly riots, and then we get an increase in minimum wage. In a deflationary system, wages will likely lag behind prices, hopefully giving a little non-interventionist bump to those that need it most.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:55:16
A deflationary system would remove much of the "gambling" from investment.
Consider the housing bubble, tech bubble, and many other recent snafus in the market. The majority of these were fueled by easy credit and policies that made certain stocks artificially more attractive than they actually were. Remove those things, and money will more easily find the most productive industries.
Deflation won't fix every issue, but it will remove the ability for people behind the scenes to pump up certain asset classes without any real productive inputs.

I do it with Coinbase as well. I simply see how much stuff I'm buying from the vendor, place an order on Coinbase, and then buy in BTC with no concerns about losing appreciation.
Sure, there's the delay with Coinbase, but I keep enough in my account to cover that.

We've had tons of investment opportunities. Tesla stock, for one, is a shining example. Learning a skilled trade is another example, as we're following a generation of marketers and paper pushers. I don't buy this angle.
Personally, I'm in it for all the ideological "junk."
