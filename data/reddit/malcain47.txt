Jeez. Educate yourself. Bitcoin has nothing to do with ATM fees.  
And don't buy stuff from unknown machines until you learn what these machines are.   
Your complaints have nothing to do with btc. It's like complaining that dollar is bad because you're using bank in Argentina.

Bad branding for who? For average brainless american?  
America is not the centre of the universe, you know.  
Same shit was spoken about wikileaks accepting bitcoin in 2011. Thing is, bitcoin doesn't care about you, your opinion and politics.  
No-brainers who only think about branding and their gains can stay the fuck off of bitcoin, you won't be missed.

Because you have no clue of what you're asking for. Read info. Listen to those who explain in simple words, like Andreas Antonopulous. You won't find answers on reddit.

1. Still is, and will continue to be better than any other store of value out there.
2. Still is, and will continue to be better than any other transfer system for medium-large amount sums.
3. For micropayments/small sums, second layer is in development.  
TLDR: If everything was already perfectly polished and working well (2nd layer) the cost of bitcoin and adoption would be much higher.   
It's great to know you're here when it is still in a development phase, and continues it's  fast and smooth grow.

In Russia there is a lot of stuff moving around bitcoin and crypto space.  
Thing is, you can't spend it as it is "illegal" to buy/sell goods for it due to bad governance policies run by corrupt politicians.

Buy a hardware wallet. This is a must, will make your life easier. Trezor or ledger, up to you (I prefer trezor)
To buy btc, there are lots of ways, one is using a proven over time peer-to-peer platforms like localbitcoins. This way you can buy directly from other people ignoring exchanges. Or try to get yourself verified on exchange. Depends on country and conditions you're in.  
Cannot say anything about ATMs. You may also want to check fees in different proven-over-time services and compare.

That guy looks like the one of those toxic persons Andreas was talking about

Looks like you're a slave who has to obey every order, even if it's irrelevant to your work.  
Damn, if only we were not living in golden age of slavery.
