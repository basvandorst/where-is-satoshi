@_date: 2019-07-23 22:15:57
You bolded a typo
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:14:12
whatever you guys need to tell yourselves to sleep better at night
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:12:27
Didn't want to put in at least a solid dollar?
@_date: 2019-07-31 11:48:47
"HODL EM" license plate. Better rob him for his bitcoin...(as usual)
@_date: 2019-07-10 10:50:01
i just dont understand in a bitcoin subreddit why all the posts about "look what bad thing libra did today"
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:10:12
i grabbed a couple off ebay from china last year
@_date: 2019-07-28 02:01:42
Everything is always good for bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:09:13
You think the police are tracking you for your bitcoin....
@_date: 2018-09-02 00:02:47
When moon?
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:13:24
Seriously? Come on man...
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:40:49
Thank you. People treat this like their favorite sports team when many people hodl multiple coins
@_date: 2018-06-02 13:08:04
How would he transfer his life savings into crypto and would it still be worth the same amount when he transfers it back to fiat?
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:18:36
Why would he use laser eyes in her apartment? come on
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:00:32
Ah yes repost after repost
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:56:48
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:48:41
Yup it's that license plate and not the car itself that will do them in. You got it
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:32:36
The man looks like buster bluth
@_date: 2019-08-14 10:51:30
you wrote this didnt you?
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:32:51
Look at the saltiness that reeks through this post...always that guy who's salty over someone he never met. whining like a baby. You want a bottle?
@_date: 2019-08-09 13:10:24
Again and again except this time it looks like they used a different professor
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:23:45
This "you're a target because of a bitcoin license plate" is just a meme on this subreddit that's been going on too long. I'm waiting for the thread where OP says he was robbed at gunpoint due to their license plate. Please find me the thread that confirms this "fact" of yours
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:14:29
That person better be careful. That bitcoin sticker is painting a target on their back am I right guys?
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:16:58
Yes you should be able to.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:32:11
Boof it
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:44:49
Whatever you guys have to say to sleep better at night. 
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:40:47
"this is good for bitcoin".
@_date: 2019-06-10 01:22:57
enough for what? what type of question is this?
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:09:28
That flex though
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:47:35
I agree with this. I dont know if it's a running gag on this subreddit that someone sporting any sort of bitcoin logo is some millionaire target
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:16:57
"Trust me guys I know what I'm talking about"
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:22:21
When moon?
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:56:29
Ah yes the "we needed this pullback" posts
@_date: 2019-06-08 16:57:08
This is not an advert but asks a question that a high schooler can answer
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:11:02
@_date: 2019-06-08 17:08:14
What is your financial situation that you are considering handing money to a guy on Instagram to help you "turn profits?"
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:19:52
Bitcoin is suppose to help the common person per this image yet it's always thse mysterious whales who are manipulating the market...
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:12:26
In case 3, why would both sides lose ₿ if  the seller cheats?
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:49:18
I could get a Michael Kors wallet for $95 lmao
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:21:56
This.  You just happen to remember 8 years later and now run to reddit for help?
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:05:27
I'm just here to test ₿
(₿) ha (₿) ₿allin
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:57:54
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:34:36
Where were you when it was hovering around the $4000 range?  Depressed that it wasn't doing anything. Now you're depressed that it's doing something. Always going to be depressed about something.
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:46:00
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:05:17
Ah yes the common "I'm not selling post"
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:59:21
That's false. You do have fees with coinbase using debit card or bank transfer
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:43:35
It's not a dollar sign. Look again
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:56:35
It definitely seems like you have something against rappers but do some research on akon
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:14:29
what is the relevancy of this obvious spam? The same garbage as "bitcoin oracle voices his opinion on bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:46:13
When lambo?
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:23:42
yawn its this again..
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:52:32
So if i wear a shirt with a dollar sign on it, am I asking to be robbed for my fiat?
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:16:09
This is the most sensical response that addresses the OP's concerns
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:37:27
Ah yes there's that analyst again with their speculation
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:18:20
you panic sold off a 4 day dip? I dont think this is cut out for everybody
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:01:36
When moon?
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:03:32
Wheres the "that guy is gonna get robbed for wearing a bitcoin shirt" responses?
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:45:36
Knowing thousands of other people feel the same way, knowing no one can go back in time
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:41:38
"not bad"
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:43:13
Someone with 20 bitcoins wouldnt be asking where they should store it people
