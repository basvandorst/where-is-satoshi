Anyone here do all their research/investing into Bitcoin/Crypto on only their smartphone?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:53:44
Where on the Ledger?  So you basically can't figure out what your public key is?
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:14:34
That makes sense.

Small money wants a piece of it, not REAL wealth money.  They don't want change, they are already happy at the TOP.

Yes but I don't I can pick my own 24 word seed with hardware wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:31:31
With a low transaction fee I could possibly wait longer for each block or once I am on the first block the succeeding blocks will go faster?
Or once slow, always slow and at the end of the priority line?
Thanks for the chart.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:08:02
That would be a good idea.

When BIG money shorts Bitcoin in the next week or so, how soon will the price CRASH?
And how far do you think it will drop?
Should we buy back in?
Or will this destroy Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency 1.0?
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:14:18
I agree, but figured I would only need that "ONE" to make it worth it?
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:56:01
Would there be a tool to make it easy to keep track?

Does anyone have a scrambled version of the BIP39?
I'm looking for a scrambled version or website that is capable of scrambling the full 2,048 words?

What if one just bought on volume alone?  Would that most likely be the top 10 highest priced coins?

What are some ideas that "you don't personally" do?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:41:26
What happens to Altcoins when Bitcoin crashes?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:54:30
I've thought about this but figured it could be put into some type of software and spit out options for a hacker to just input the words and over time the seed could be brute forced into unlocking the account?
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:57:41
I'm sure my idea isn't new, is there a guide on doing this the best way?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:24:56
What particular library are you suggesting or referencing? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:09:53
I'm assuming the 10 minutes per block is an average of low to high fees..  what would be the average time for a low transaction fee per block take?
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:03:49
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:25:01
I thought about doing something like this as well.  Or some type of word puzzle online where you add your own words and save the picture, people would have no clue on what it was if mixed with thousands of other pictures etc.  Or something along those lines.

Too much fluctuation

How can I buy them privately, discreetly and securely from anywhere in the world and sell without having the physical metal?

Looking for something digital or something I don't need to store on me or somewhere.

Today you were able to afford this, 6 months from now maybe a $50 bicycle from Walmart.  
Good to lock in your loss now...err I mean profits.

Medium and also tiny towns nobody's ever heard of .. there was one at market next to the live chickens and buckets full of crab and other strange fish species.. 99% of people won't speak much if any English.. and it's pretty much an all cash society so seeing that was a strange thing.. I think I have a pic somewhere.

There's actually a few Bitcoin Cafe Coffee's in small towns in Vietnam where there are literally ZERO foreigners.. 
I'm talking where everyone stares at you like a freak because you're white and an oddity.

I don't agree with this as like a lot of companies they send you some canned response that most of the time has nothing to do with the question or problem.. if they fixed their customer service support this wouldn't be posted on social media..
@_date: 2019-01-13 07:52:30
Wait!?   Tuna Mike?
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:54:15
Mike.  You're a legend.

I'm just upvoting the pic 5/5

What specific app are you referencing?
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:28:28
Ok but please don't waste my time if you're not serious 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:55:49
I'll bet you a BTC it goes to 3k before 50k
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:03:17
It needs to go lower so the NEW blood can get excited when you can tell them "hey remember when Bitcoin was 20k?  It's down to $2,500 and about to jump back up to 20k and then up to 50k..You missed out last time, don't miss out on the real time to get in on the "ground floor"..
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:49:39
It's not BEAR enough yet...sub 3k that is the time to put in all the chips... now..No..  dump it all
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:22:19
Good catch, I actually thought of that a little while ago.  Nicely done.
