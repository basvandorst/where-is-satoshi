Internet connection is more the limiting factor here, correct?
I'm one of the lucky few who has gig @ home and setting up a node was a non issue for me.

in your situation, totally a viable option [minus potential early failure of your GPU, which is possible and worth thinking about for OP]
more posted some  for OP to read to get an idea of what us average nicehash miners are getting out of doing this. 
Also important to note you aren't mining bitcoin, but rather getting paid in bitcoin to mine Altcoins.

A month...?
I know I was able to do mine in under three days, and feel like it even under 24 hours. It was a fresh OS with 4.0GHz, 8 core processor, SSD, Gig fiber. I did this months ago.  
How is there so much variance between us?

Beats me. Probably nothing comes of it. But oh well

ROI is suuuuper tough right now. I am on a 1080 ti and only stated to make ~2usd a day.
electricity also eats at that 2$ a day "profit" heavily depending on your electric costs.

hmm.. TIL
I was always under the impression they wasn't exclusive to plural when used as a non-familiar singular identifier. However I don't feel like I can trust anything I hear when it comes to grammar with english...

Oh, so there's overlap between the different BIPs!
That makes WAAAY more sense, I was thinking that they were all independent of each other. 
It is taking time, but thanks to this community I am feeling like I'm actually making progress learning about all this.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:53:24
thanks for the reply, but changing my node means that I am actively pushing for a BIP, right?
if so could you eli5 why I should modify to this signal [I was under the understanding that bip91 was where this community is headed, not bip148]. If I am misunderstanding could you direct me towards some more novice explanations I can read up on as I really do want to become more competent in this currency I am essentially betting on.
Also post up a receiving address, I really appreciate the time and knowledge base.
Again, Thanks a ton!

just as a general statement... I would suggest not buying in such low volumes, your fees are eating into your % by a lot. Save up and buy in bigger volumes at less frequency.

Largely dependent on your $-&gt;kilowatt wherever you live.

which in part supports the bitcoin network, but only by proxy.
you are generating bitcoin by forcing Nice Hash/ clients to purchase the coins to pay you. 
so yes you aren't helping by decentralizing mining in bitcoin. But you are still furthering bitcoin in a more general sense.
