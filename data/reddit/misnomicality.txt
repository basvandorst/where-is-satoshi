Call it the Bitcoin gold color

On what evidence or speculation do you believe that will happen? But hey it's your money, do as you wish.

Bitcoin must be hollow-earther digging down for the underground moon

The currency itself is decentralized, however it still is a form of monetary asset regardless of its tangibility. Also unregulated does not mean it is free of jurisdictions. You are very wrong in legal terms.

If only Tether existed back then. Probably using any fiat would've made them easily traceable and being buttfucked in jail.

Today is my birthday as well, can you send me some coins OP? You would look like a real shithead if you refuse because you're begging for bitcoins in the same way.

If it was a legitimate scam or against the terms of contract, then yes, as to the actual cases such as the mt gox and bitconnect.
I am not in defense of the OP since he didn't clarify the trader being a fund manager/trader with any valid contract and terms etc or if the bitcoins were just sent to him...which would make any refund or legal course difficult as crypto being crypto, but still plausible if there were evidence of written agreements.

If you bought it as a long term investment, hold on and wait for good news to arrive. But if you just bought it to trade or thinking it's gonna suddenly make you a lot of money, then you are very wrong and will lose money. I assume you bought it high on 24th, right now it is on a downtrend about to bounce to an up trend maybe above 8000 again, but there is no guarantee.
So if you have no trading knowledge but want to make quick money, then give it a couple days and maybe sell at a reasonable little profit, don't think it's gonna just shoot up to $50000 all of sudden, that's stupidity. Or just hodl for long term for few months to years, but just get out when shit goes south as fuck.

That's not an evidence nor anything significant. Anyone can predict and say this and that but even the most sophisticated technical analyst will be wrong 50/50. You clearly seem to have no idea on investing or crypto, I assume you just bought bitcoin from the hype. That is gambling, not investing. That is fine, just be careful not to be reckless with your money and not fall into hypes or media bullshit. If you are rich balling on money then why not. Good luck!

What makes me an idiot is that I was aware of bitcoin since 2010 and kept thinking I should buy every year, but only bought some in late 2016. One of my greatest regret of my life so far.

Waiting for someone to get wasted and sends 0.1btc instead of 0.01btc
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:19:35
well...bitcoin is still "The" crypto.

Already verified with mods? Then any of your info would be more valuable then just those who chant ETF solely for bullish price actions. Big ups for doing it man.
