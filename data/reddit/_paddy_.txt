How bitcoin.com got taken over by Bitcoin Cash guys instead of Bitcoin guys? 
@_date: 2018-06-01 14:58:27
70% off?! Looks like scam to me :-) /s
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:54:48
This is all fine but try not to make it look like Bitcoin Gold :-)
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:27:27
Why is the crypto market red even after this kind of news?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:03:14
Which movie is this?
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:03:48
What a quick rebound to ATH!:-)
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:53:52
I know (NO) economics.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:33:33
Yeah. This kid is famous overnight :-)
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:03:24
I disown you.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:51:13
Will be interesting to see how it goes.

For people lazy enough to switch on the audio - She: What is he doing? He: He's is beginning to believe..... and then the guy falls like Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:49:08
Somehow I sensed it earlier Robinhood is going to act like Iqoption.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:42:59
Now enjoy buying the dip!:-)
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:10:18
He does exactly opposite of what he says... oops...
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:09:42
DEJA VU.
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:16:42
From where is this original clip? His expressions and look (white hairs) are prefect for an investor :-)
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:16:26
50k! Take that!
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:09:36
Yeah, money laundering via Bitcoin is risky. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:39:07
Yeah, all type of crypto investors should be allowed to live.
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:53:43
Ask the guy who bought Bitcoin  USD. He might feel that he is not from this world :-)
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:41:40
"Alts just watching?" - is the wrong part as they fell even harder :-)
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:25:15
The dance at the end...wow!!!
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:00:13
Including you.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:48:11
On a lighter note... I hope you went for dinner and not lunch :-)
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:14:39
This meme is back!
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:48:20
Wow! Bitcoin and Litecoin paid for his ticket to Olympics! I am coming next year!!!
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:08:47
OP is lying??? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:37:30
Yeah. Yeah, it is!
@_date: 2018-04-07 13:06:01
This is getting ridiculous day by day. Some dumb people making some dumb comments. If India has banned banks from allowing fiat transfers to exchanges then how the hell Indians can purchase crypto currencies using their fiat.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:56:07
Probably you didn't get the pun intended.
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:41:05
No, they don't. Not yet.
