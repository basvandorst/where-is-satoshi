And it's 1.5million in Japan. It does not mean their currency or your currency sucks. It's just numbers created by humans. It's the fluctuation in exchange rates and not the absolute value that matters

Lol at person who thought that I thought Vancouver was in China

Just because it's China doesn't mean people can't become successful running a legitimate business. Countries have to start somewhere before they become developed enough to afford the luxury of a mandated maximum 40 hour workweek

That's definitely a problem with cryptocurrencies in general.  Once the protocol is set it's difficult to enable a modification to it. While the network effect can keep bitcoin prospering, alt. coins will ultimately dilute its  marketshare in the crypto world.

Not really.. I've had predictable maintenance of my vehicle and it has been reliable for 160,000 miles. I've never needed to treat illnesses, feed it when it's hungry and give it water or deal with behavioral issues. I think you could have chosen a much better analogy because I'd say car ownership is much easier than horse ownership would be.

That's why you invest your unused fiat into bonds or equities so that you nullify the effects of inflation. Unlike cryptocurrency, fiat is predictable and easily manageable in terms of long run inflation. Sorry to burst the bubble, but I strongly believe according to my unbiased opinion that fiat will remain the dominant form of currency even over the next century at the very least. Sure, blockchain could be useful, but using blockchain for currency is most likely not going to work out all that well in the long run.

Japan would be the last developed nation to collapse honestly. It is actually remarkably stable. Europe would be the first for sure.

Excellent point.
