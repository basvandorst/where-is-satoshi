Well we're not on the tracks yet, we're still traveling down the road in a half-empty bus with fear that it might be full when we get to the rail crossing.
Doing the hardfork now, means we're teleporting directly on the rail tracks without any prior knowledge of incoming trains on that busy crossing.

I think that's just spreading FUD. Not acting is just not acting... deliberate choice, yes by some, but nobody's decision. 
Also, you can look at it (change) this way: softfork &lt; hardfork.

What about him?
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:27:27
Agreed. Anyone who wants to change basic Bitcoin premises should go and make his own coin. Good luck with that, tho (hint: XT).
@_date: 2015-12-18 03:33:16
He also had his name not smeared and dragged into the mud of accusations, so he could write it without that burden... as most of other devs couldn't.  
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:38:01
How so?
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:03:22
We can observe just one vector: Bigger blocks &gt; Chinese miners out &gt; more centralized network. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:59:57
Blocks are going to get 75% increase with SW. And without hard-fork risk. It's almost a win-win situation.
@_date: 2015-12-22 04:01:21
Interest in both capacity and scalability had always existed, but the ways to get there were diametrically opposed. This is an excellent and safe way to satisfy both sides - "security oriented" and "block increase" teams.
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:28:11
Well, that's not how it works. 
You're claiming all that nonsense, so the burden of proof is on your side.
@_date: 2015-12-18 07:54:10
Maybe... there are a lot of unexplored options still (SW is one of those that came up, but weren't there before). But anyway, SW will be a good test with small disruption, i.e. no hard fork which is much more dangerous.

What dark place where the Sun don't shine you're pulling these statements from?
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:07:45


TIL, Google is one of the most decentralized companies today. (# of users, y'know.)
All jokes aside, what he said there, yeah, but he decided to keep quiet about GPU mining for as long as he could, and he introduced 1MB blocks to save the network so Bitcoin can gain traction. Bitcoin's not firm on its feet yet, it's still not resilient enough and we have to keep it that way until better technology is introduced and/or Bitcoin network is mature and more resilient. Large scale and mass market are not for current state of Bitcoin, apparently (and according to Satoshi (and his actions) as well).
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:33:28
No need. It's working as it is. Even small increase is possible! And, guess what, even without hard fork (i.e. SW)!
@_date: 2015-12-19 22:13:49
Well, you could presume he is, but he never openly said it. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:43:45


It's not about the "right" value, but the fact that bigger blocks cause centralization hence censorship is easier and network as a whole is less secure.


Non-fungible currency can't be popular enough, so less users, hence no need for more TPS.


My point exactly (first sentence). With Bitcoin current fungibility properties it will grow (as we can see right now), once the big blocks are introduced and security compromised, centralization hits and there is less interest in the Bitcoin, hence less transactions per second. That confirms that the security, fungibility and resilience are paramount.


Bitcoin devs (Satoshi) didn't use 1MB number just for the sake of it, but to save the network, so it can gain traction later on. That is what he wanted for Bitcoin and that is what everyone else who like Bitcoin want.
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:30:53
We wouldn't have SegWit if we went for XT. And with many other technologies invented/proposed I wouldn't say the development is slowing. Rather opposite - the Bitcoin is gaining in resilience and usability thanks to such inventions like SW. 
Keeping 1MB blocks is preventing ruination of the network, as intended by Satoshi.
@_date: 2015-12-21 22:59:34
Sorry, dropped a few, I guess...?


So, what I was trying to say is Bitcoin will hopefully be able to support bigger blocks than 2MB in future, but for now it will get an 'instant' increase of 75% with SW soft-fork. And that's just a beginning, other options and technologies are out there and might not need hard forking as well to get to bigger TPS number.
@_date: 2015-12-19 22:04:32


I didn't.
For the exact reasons you've listed.
And now, we can be certain he doesn't have bettering of Bitcoin on the top of his list of priorities - and that confirms previous suspicions about his agenda - which was, if not secret, never openly promoted. He never said he wants to evolve Bitcoin into something very different, you could only conclude that from his actions he promoted as Bitcoin bettering. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 04:18:43
Your ability to understand a technology should not be something to gauge against. If it *sounds complicated* to **you**, doesn't mean it is.
Your mental capacity is not a relevant metric here whatsoever. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:55:40
I agree with that completely, except for the usefulness part because there's more to it. But, yeah, for the rest I agree in essence. And hopefully it won't be just 2MB but 75% increase!
@_date: 2015-12-19 07:34:11
Yeah, he wanted to play with the big (criminal/wallstreet) guys again, but got that feeling back he had for decades that made him hate their guts, when he saw what's cookin'. 
I'm surprised as well he wanted to get back in bed with the people he once fantasized seeing burn and die. 
...Or maybe that was his secret plan all along... get inside the hive and f'them up from the inside?!
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:25:14
Where's that quote from? Thanks!
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:21:07
Nobody wants to keep the blocks small forever, but to make Bitcoin more resilient, get the technology ready, and only then go out into mass market (large TPS, bigger block size). As of now, Bitcoin is not resilient enough, and centralization would morph it into something else (change the basic premise) and possibly kill it.
@_date: 2015-12-23 06:55:42

@_date: 2015-08-02 04:50:18
Yep, he is elusive for the most part as we could witness over the years. It's almost like no one saw him or have talked to him, ever. It's like he never even worked at Mt.Gox; nobody knows what he was in charge of, and what were his responsibilities... is he to blame for *anything*?! 
...and, there he was, easily noticeable on the train in a megalopolis like Tokyo... but nothing more than that; *no idea*.
Why haven't you, at least, approached him to say hi?
C'mon he was your boss (possibly, in a way). Surely he was *way* better one than Mark was... right??? 
So... odd. One would expect you'd have a lot to talk about given the place you've both spent most of your days. Or have at least some questions for each other. If nothing of substance, but: -"How you've been?" -"Good. And you, how are your kids?" -"All swell." -"OK, good to see ya!" -"Same, have a good one. ^Unlike ^that ^Karpeles ^guy." 
So, after that silly segue - What was your relation with Gonsague while you were working at Mt.Gox? What was it after you've left? What do you think of his role and management skills at Mt.Gox? Do you have anything to blame him for as he was high ranked officer next to Mark? Is he even real?!!11!

As for the post itself... What would be the goal for Blockstream asking for Gavin's removal from the Bitcoin Foundation? Are you suspecting someone from Blockstream is retarded or oblivious of the fact that chief scientist title means nothing when it comes to Bitcoin development?! Bitcoin Foundation itself means almost nothing as of lately, let alone "chief scientist" position. Furthermore, do you think that Blockstream doesn't know that the paycheck Gavin is receiving is not coming from the Bitcoin Foundation?

Sorry if my post came out as confusing, but I don't think there was a slightest glimpse of doubt about the current situation and state of Bitcoin today in it. Thanks for the write-up tho, I'm sure someone will find it useful as a quick guide into the current state of Bitcoin community and desired future for the Bitcoin as a whole.
In the original post I wasn't taking about any of those aforementioned subjects (your second and the last paragraph), but I was trying to raise awareness about dangers of the lead dev position getting into hands of Mike Hearn's (especially with the knowledge of his previous proposals for censorship, redlisting, TOR filtering, etc). If XT wins Bitcoin will effectively become a different project with a different lead developer. Yes, it still will be a voluntaristic, free, open source, project, but with a lead dev who has proved himself to be pretty hostile to openness, decentralization and free speech, and more prone to censorship, filtering and centralization. Furthermore, you can see right now what he's like... if he's not satisfied with the path where the project is going, he will fork it regardless of the consequences for the original project.
I agree with the notion that this fork is not about 'status of lead dev' as you said, but if XT wins 'status of lead dev' could become a great danger or even detrimental to Bitcoin. Similar to situation how Mike himself see Wladimir right now. 
So, all the technical aspects of this proposal are debatable of course, but regardless of what happens on the technical side, with the XT you get liability on the dev side.

OK, but why do you need 8MB? What's the difference for you if blocksize starts with 4MB or 2MB?? 
If the point is in expanding the network through blocksize increase, then you'd be happy with any increase and any number bigger than 1MB. Over time the network will get to 8MB or whatever will be necessary in the future. Why didn't you worked toward that goal, if that is your goal?!
