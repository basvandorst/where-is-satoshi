You need to add the fee to the transaction amount (more technical answer: the fee is the difference between the transaction inputs and outputs)

I dollar cost average since mid 2017. That means I bought at 17,000 $ if thats any consolation

And what‘s your trustworthy source?
@_date: 2019-11-16 16:47:50
It don‘t think it will. Btc is one of the few truly decentralized coins and that it will change the world :-)

And many people had money on the sidelines and didn‘t invest

I think most people expected lower lows

Fair, could be a two way effect
Edit: But when I think about it, I don‘t think that any additional money will invest in BTC just because the hash rate increases. So the effect that hash rate drives price should be really minor from my view

Well, it looks like you made a decision. So do what feels right for you. But don‘t come crying if you never hit your buy level
@_date: 2019-10-25 07:00:32
No. Hash rate is a lagging indicator from my perspective
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:19:23
Because price will determine for how many miners it is profitable to mine. And that will in turn determine hash rate. How would hash rate determine price?

We‘ll all be fine if Bitcoin does not turn out to be an everyday currency (for paying that cup of coffee). Just the store of value use case promises a great future market cap and a great return for all of us.

Go to settings -&gt; general -&gt; and then change the exchange to see if this is just a price transmission mistake

It‘s a long video, but quite interesting. You can skip the first 30 minutes as they only get to the Lightning topic then.
I am wondering if the mentioned 5 challenges to Lightning can be solved.
