This seems a thing these days. I met someone a few years ago who is trying to get real estate on the blockchain. I have him on LinkedIn and asks $5 to give a reply, because his inbox is flooding these days.

I was able to recover it because i had the private key.

No not jet. The app needs webactivation first :). When I enter the (what I think) the correct password, it returns to the page saying its the wrong. later I don't get the email anmore. Maybe I do something wrong. I look up if I have hidden it somewhere. At least I found the 12 word key.

Thanks for the fast response! Now I know that I'm at least not the only one. Never used their app but I'll try. I've got the same problem as you posted here:

Seriously. A buddy of mine just started digging into bitcoin. But had 20$ on a paper wallet from 4 years ago I created for him now worth +600$. He was in no hurry and paid only 1$ for the transfer. But it seemed it was only 23 sat/byte. Just a few months ago it was no problem. But it's now struck for days. What are the options?
Is it gone forever because no miner will pick it up? Can you boost it by adding fees? Pay a miner to pick it? Doublespend it with an higher fee in some way?
I haven't been paying attention to bitcoin for quite a while, but it seems that 'Bitcoin the currency for micro transactions' is death.

Good to check your copy paste btw. A few years ago there was some malware that replaced a copied bitcoin address with one from a scammer when It recognized one.

Its more than 3 years old at least. It was created between the spawn of 3 years and 8 months and 4 years and 2 months ago.

Hey someone finally corrected the candlestick colors!

No. Up until a fork it doesn't matter on what address you have them. The only upside (for now) is that I have my BTC, BCH and BTG stored in the same address for hodl. If you actually wants to use them its smarter to move it to new chain related address so you won't accidentally mix them up. Like wanting to pay in BCH but sent the same amount in the BTC chain to an BTC address not owned by the receiver.

What is the downside to keep it in old addresses? I don't expect most of my coins to move in a few years
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:31:18
Is there any crucial downside to keep it on an old ( address or could be one in the future? On [the Wiki]( it says it has no compatibility issues at least.
I backed my Bitcoins up the most paranoid way possible to hodl. So I prefer not to touch them unless or until I need to.

Thanks for the quick response. I'll reevaluate my decision when SW became the norm or when its starts booming again :)
