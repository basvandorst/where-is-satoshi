Everything you mentioned applys to all currency what are you going to do with all your dollar bills when it's worth nothing? Burn them for warmth or eat them to stay alive. Oh and it's not protected by a bank? You mean the banks that shorted millions of homeowners on subprime mortgages and left them homeless and our economy on the brink of collapse. I don't want the protection of a system that has only ever worked for itself and just allowed a small trickle down of the benefits they reap in bushels.

So something a government is afraid of is bad? Governments are afraid of free speech and the right to personal freedoms to so we should just give up on those because they are valueless? Quit being a fiat cuck and learn how close the us dollar is to the collapse

Describe taxes to me? I make 15 an hour by the time I pay taxes I'm lucky to get 12 an hour and then I go buy something and I pay tax on that as well. We are already getting 38 dollars for our 50 man.

It's currency you aren't buying stock you are buying gold or beads or goats just the new currency for a world market instead of a fiat tied to a piece of land for no reason. The only crash would be if you wanted to trade your bitcoin for another currency at the end of the day it can be traded independently

How much do you think it costs to swipe your debt card at a gas station? Just because the fees are invisible to you doesn't mean they don't exist
