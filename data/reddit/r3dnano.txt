I'm actually buying soon

Does it make sense to wait for it to go below 8k to buy again?

I want to do this on a raspberry pi.
How big is the Blockchain currently?

I k is, but what if for any reason that wallet software stops working? Do I have any option to use the same address in two wallet software?

Started investing recently: Is it a common thing to invest a little every month rather just piles and piles of money?

July 1st is supposed to be bull season start according to some rumours around the internet: how accurate can this be? Is the latest price rise an effect of this prediction?

So, what I'm worried about right now is scalability. The Blockchain network seems to be growing really fast and soon, that 200 GB Blockchain might grow exponentially if the usage extends, and adoption occurs, as we are hoping. So, the difficult scalability might be an issue in a not so far future.... Which are the counter measures or what's the way bitcoin is going to overcome this? Serious question, I'm kinda new in all this

I'm not stupid and I have money. I wouldn't even think in trying to brute force addresses, it's just dumb. I just get a hard on seeing some large numbers.
I like large stuff

What cryptos are good to mine with CPU? I have a lot of CPUs but no GPU...

(Serious) Piggybacking on this question

Newbie here with IT knowledge: I still have my stuff on the broker. I'm looking for wallets but can't make up my mind.
I always tend to use official software, that's why I downloaded biotcoin core, but i'm looking into lightweight wallets that don't need to download the whole blockchain... can anyone recommend me easy to use, safe and maintained software lightweight wallets?
Currently testing electrum and doesn't seem bad.

Ok, and this lightning, is it an extension of Bitcoin or a completely different network?
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:40:24
Soy I have my bitcoins in electrum wallet and for some reason, that software disappears or I just plain want to use a different one. What is the correct way to go?
I'm still considering which wallet to use and still don't have a hardware one (don't have that much funds still, actually)

Is there any way to earn bitcoin passively? 
I'm kind of new and I only know two ways of getting bitcoin: Mining, which is really non profitable and good old buying in exchange of dollar/euro.
What are other ways?

Sorry if the question is stupid: what's the difference between cryptocurrency and token?
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:56:27
Ok, I know it's impossible but I'd like to know some numbers:
Say I type a random Bitcoin private key. What are the chances I land an account with funds?
Just wanting to see some astronomical numbers :)
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:34:34
Too late
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:37:44
Is this considered a dip?
I'd call a dip and would probably buy once it gets below 9k

European here wanting to buy bitcoin with fiat: It's been a year since I last checked on kraken and now I have to verify even more in order to deposit and use FIAT.... I can't even remember why I used kraken, TBH: What method/web/exchange would you recommend me to invest fiat with the lowest possible price? IIRC, kraken would charge you less than 1%, whereas binance will charge you 3.6% for buying with credit card (percentages may vary: That's from the top of my head)
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:25:33
If price goes up to 50k, would 13k be tops?
That's the thing with this, while improbable, it's still a possibility.

Is it too late to get rich with cryptos?
