I think you mean Mycelium not Electrum.

The video and this tread have fired up my interest in this project even more. Will have to go read all the linked material now. :)

The thing I like about the Factom project is that, while it must be complex to implement, it is very specific in its goals. Paul Snow has himself said that Factom does very little; it allows you to write, read and verify data. I think many crypto 2.0 projects are likely to get bogged down by over ambition it terms of wanting to change the world etc. This project, on the other hand, seems like having a good chance of getting off the ground. The real challenge IMO will be the task of selling the idea to potential users who are unfamiliar with the virtues of the blockchain. Explaining blockchain tech to potential users will be the main hurdle I feel. Unless someone really understands the workings of the blockchain they are unlikely to appreciate what Factom brings to the table.

This is something I would buy or crowd fund. Look into affordable international shipping as well. Could the same concept be used to create a small box that can hold a USB stick? Opening the box would need some rethinking though.

Thanks for this. 500 bits @_date: 2015-01-18 02:11:36
Yes, thanks for putting it all together.

Ironically, the first time I heard of Factom and decided I should give the project a serious look-over was when reading this article: [Appcoins Are Snake Oil]( by Daniel Krawisz. In the comments section Paul Snow (paulsnx2) puts in a strong case for why Factom needs to use a native token, namely its Factoid. Essentially, it is to prevent spamming and to offer a decentralized service, as he (again points out in this thread.

With the land title use case, it seems to me that the only way the rightful owner will be able to defend his claim is if: 1) he has a copy of the original digital document and 2) he verifies during the registration process that the hash in the blockchain corresponds with his copy of the digital file. Subsequently, if there should be any alteration of the title document, he will be able to verify that his copy is the original, earliest timestamped copy and hence the legitimate copy.

James is excited about Factom (Factom.org), (29mins into the video). If you want to DIY and create an OP_RETURN tx to stick some data in the blockchain, I would recommend this tutorial:
I’ve tried it myself and it works great. Note that Factom is a lot more than sticking a hash in the blockchain. Check out their website.

Very helpful summary. Thanks.

If any guy in the Bitcoin universe can pull this off, it’s Paul Snow… but maybe lay off the Popeyes fried chicken while in training? :)
Great charities. Wonderful how Bitcoin makes it so easy to donate even though I’m on the other side of the globe.

My device packing, received in Malaysia, was also clearly tampered with. No attempt was made to cover up the tampering. This is the first time I’ve had something like this happen. The fact that this seems to have happened globally suggests to me that it may be some kind of new anti-terrorism type procedure that has recently been put in place internationally.

Glad to see all is back to normal for Mycelium. The good folks behind Mycelium are doing a great job and their conduct throughout this whole episode is more evidence of that. Google has inadvertently given Mycelium a solid dose of positive publicity.

Great work guys. Looking forward to receiving the device, but also the t-shirt actually.

Your frustration is perfectly understandable.
