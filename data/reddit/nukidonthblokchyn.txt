Quick mafs.

In my experience yes. The BTC is held in Escrow until you realise it (from a selling standpoint). Also you get options on how to pay (cash, bank transfer, PayPal).

Use localbitcoin.com.

Auto correct. Meant to say "until you release it"

Exchange it for BTC then go to localbitcoin.com. Sell for cash.

I don't want exchanges to be easy. Just wallets.

Surely the question isn't how but WHY. Any thoughts on suspects guys?
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:20:49
That's the point.

Spoofy... Is that you...?

Buy low, sell high. Sounds legit.

9% is kinda standard. Don't forget you're paying for the ATM service. Coinbase charges a little less. Or better yet localbitcoin.

Put dollars on Coinbase, transfer to GDAX, buy a limit order just below current price. Boom. 
Thank me later.

Yeah I can't really approach executives as my homeless seagull shit-covered image isn't great. I can however do trashy shit that makes people ask what it is. 
Feel free to chip in with how many random people you've encouraged to question what this weird digital cash thing is.

It's a dog eat dog world and some people are hungry.

Localbitcoin.com works for me. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:21:46
Best? Afraid that's up to you to decide. But I know they do bank transfer, PayPal, cash the works.

Bitcoin was never about making money. 
It's about being money.
