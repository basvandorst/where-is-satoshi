Having more wallets increases attack surface but mitigates large losses on single breaches.  
Statistically they are more likely to have a loss with multiple wallets or storage methods (especially if they are different methods of storage), however a single breach will have less of an impact.

Uber driver on Saturday asked me if I knew about Bitcoin. Nice hour long conversation. Told him to HODL.

No way man. He sold. No beauty there  (wipes away tears with fiat money)

That second example is how people get screwed. I buy in, and average out the average price i bought at. I then set a sell for that particular number, so that no matter what i never “lose”. In order to prevent “fomo”  i generally Then set a “Buy” for that number so that if the market reaches it again, it will “Buy” at that number. Only danger here is if the market is very volatile literally AT my average cost I will get screwed. This is just to prevent a free fall situation.  
Also diversify. Look at other coins who are NOT affected when bitcoin fluctuates. Have an exit plan not to USD but to alt coins. 
Just my 2 Satoshi.

I am beginning to see the forest from the trees. Coinbase has had enough time to scale up and out. They have had enough time to write a set of rules. They are mature enough at this point to not be a “wow I hope this works today and they don’t shut down when I need them most”. I experienced Mt Gox. And the thing that I realized earlier this week was that I’m not afraid Coinbase will be hacked, as much as I am afraid of a hidden agenda, and extreme self preservation. 
Put some rules in place Coinbase and stick to them. Or you’re out. If Microsoft opens an exchange, then all of my “active” trading coins are going there.

So wait this isn’t a get rich quick scheme? /s
Good.  It will be taken more seriously this way. Also keep your crypto off exchanges if you want to stay anonymous. And don’t cash out for fiat if you are that concerned.

Have a Trezor and a Ledger S 
I try to keep half in each in case one ever has a flaw or security issue with the device I can immediately transfer to the other. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:34:43
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:38:26
So this is a ledger within a ledger. Ledgerception.

The general consensus here is that BCash has tried shady methods to try to come out on top. 
There’s no lite coin hate here really. I have a bunch of them.
