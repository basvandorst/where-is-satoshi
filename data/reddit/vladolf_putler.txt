Just give me some sort of browser extension that can hold a tiny amount of bitcoins, with an adjustable "max bid per article", which then pays a tiny sum for each article you read without giving you any sort of delay, ads, prompt, block or anything like that.
It would be so awesome, and will probably save/revolutionize internet content completely. Once paying for content becomes extremely cheap and hassle free, we might finally start to see a reduction in the visual diarrhea that is advertisement.

Well, I support anything targeting Russians. If this will give a boost to bitcoin, then all the better.

I dont think you understand how little income ads generate. We're talking 1/1000 USD per view. Having users pay for content would also eliminate huge expenses on getting advertisers, so it could likely become even cheaper.

Russia deserves to fucking die, though. I hope bitcoins eventual domination will rip their shitty dictatorship to pieces

Any attempts at coin validation will start a war.
