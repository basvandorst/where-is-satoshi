It means  person to person payment will be hardly available.
I can envision wallet providers opening channels user -&gt; wallet
But who will open channels (somebody) -&gt; user?
Users will credit their wallets with LN balances to make cheap payments.
But who will credit LN channel directed to user? 
any idea?

I'm not sure Tresor can not be stolen and hacked to extract private keys from memory, may be by hardware hacking.
With this devices you are restricted to what their developers allow you to do.
With Ledger for example I can not sign message correctly because it does not let me choose the key (address) I want to use for signing for example.
My own computer will be much more flexible.

BCH EDA change is not coincidence.
It allow the same profit for miners as on Core chain.
It effectively pulls profit-oriented miners from Core chain allowing political-oriented miners to kill 1x chain with less hashrate.
BCH is a part of a plan  - it will survive and replace 1x , 2x  will not survive.

Have you tried to add additional device?
It loads your 2FA keys, but they are encrypted with your backup password.
If  advesary did not know your backup password then he can not get access to your keys
