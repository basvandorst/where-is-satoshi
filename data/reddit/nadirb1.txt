Your lifestyle changes have nothing to do with BTC.
Also, you're obviously in this for the investment and you've bought into a bear market. 
Hope things work out.

BTC is down 50% from where it was a month ago. How are people still going around saying that 'it doesn't lose value'. 
Are you guys literally braindead?

Your changes in lifestyle have nothing to do with BTC. Where you invest is not incumbent on your decision *to* invest.
It's like investing in the bond market and saying 'Omg! Thank god for bonds otherwise I'd never have invested!'

Lol? What long enough timeline of the USD are you talking about?

Sounds more like a commodity than it does a currency. Nobody should want to keep a currency that fluctuates double digits everyday.
It's supposed to be a stable store of value and a medium of exchange. As of now, nobody is accepting it, so it's not a medium of exchange. And it's lost 50% of it's total value in the last month, so it's not storing shit.
It really is starting to sound like a scheme that is being sold to a new generation of conspiratorial Anonymous types who think that the government is trying to buttplug you in every single aspect of your life.

Sounds like an awful currency if seasonal buying makes it lose half of its value.
Wouldn't happen if people actually accepted Bitcoin.

Eur usd hasn't been stable since March 2016. Using a single pair is also a miserable example. Look at indices.

Moreover, you should be talking in yearly averages. Not week over week. A yearly move broken down into an average weekly change of 2% is 104% change in a year.
Not stable. Nor a good store of value.

+-2% per week fluctuation per week is by no metric stable.
Do you even know what you're talking about or do you just yammer pro BTC nonsense without thinking?
