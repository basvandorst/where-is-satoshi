I’d rewrite it then, it’s not written very well.

If that’s your idea of “checkmate” I think you have lower standards than your brother.

Why are you reply to a 27 day old comment. Also if it was a crash bubble everything would be at 0. It’s a correction. You can’t have massive gains without some sort of consolidation. It was expected. Go away.

If you read it again, he is saying they don’t even understand that statement.

A comeback that complains about a comeback... How original.

Personally, Bitcoin is my least invested crypto, and regardless of opinions, IDC. I’m open to debate on a topic, but only if you bring something to the table. You are literally making claims with absolutely no information or statistics to back it up. That is not helpful at all. People have money invested in this, so be more cautious with your fingers on that keyboard. If you have something to critique or something to say about it, then great, I want to hear it, but only if you have information to back up your claims. Otherwise, you are nothing but a mudslinger.

If you are going to sling shit at something, back it up with facts and information. Otherwise, gtfo fudder

Nope. It’s still not a crash moron. Look at the past year of pricing. It’s hardly gone down in the grand scheme. Anything that shoots up will consolidate. That’s expected.

I replied the same day he made that comment. Got eyes?
