The hamster wheel project
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:20:48
Bitfury was supporting bip91 among the first ones. So clearly everything is fine
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:28:57
Ethereum Classic ETC is the one immutable now and will rise strong. As BTC if keeps its immutability too.
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:50:10
The division is between bitcoin core and bitcoin unlimited. ? Or from within the mining groups
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:41:28
Lets move to Litecoin
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:32:39
It was made by my friend right here  
Got some other cool stuff too..
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:43:32
Sorry, what are the differences in a quick reply?
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:40:05
Bitcoin will fork anyway so we should be moving our funds to another coin anyway. I would prefer Litecoin because its the closest related to bitcoin and we will be linked by the atomic swap and segwit. Blessings.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:47:04
Im moving to Litecoin 
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:13:01
What groups support each option? Thank you so much!!!!
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:07:27
Hell yeah!
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:41:55
Lets move to Litecoin
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:44:11
Bitcoin is too unstable and risky.. im moving to Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:33:25
Bitcoin and litecoin will have segwit :)
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:48:19
Time to move the coins from BITCOIN to LITECOIN
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:08:26
You are cranky because you all know that BTC funds are at a great risk right now and you Have to move to another coin to save some of your money. This coin is LITECOIN because is the most related to bitcoin with plus technology scalability and speed.
