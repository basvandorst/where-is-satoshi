Is it possible for the bitcoin core team to increase the supply of bitcoins from 21 to 210 million; kinda like how they did so when adding segwit.

I don’t understand what u are getting at

Let’s remember what Satoshi wrote in the genesis block: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
Bitcoin is supposed to be technology that is disruptive to the banks.

I think Trace is great but he skirts all sorts of questions and comments. Don makes great points about anonymity and unknown counter-parties.

Bitpay has laid down the grow work to be the only shop in town to settle bitcoin transaction in fiat. The proliferation of bitcoin in the mainstream directly helps Bitpay. 
In short, it was a really smart move for Bitpay. The layman does not know what Bitpay is but they have heard of Bitcoin.

My point is that the ledger is public. If you give cash to me, there is no record. 
With respect to bank transfers; the sender, the recipient, and the bank knows a transfer has happened - but it ain't public info.

I don't understand why malwarebytes gives messages that it is blocking bitmessage/bitcoinqt
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:52:28
So now, is there is any need to rebackup the wallet after creating a new receive address?

I wanna see this guy in a debate with Don Harrold. I heard Trace Meyer debate Harrold and all trace did was dodge privacy and inflation questions.

Isn’t BCash more like the real bitcoin?  Didn’t Satoshi say that bitcoin should increase the block size over time?
I don’t understand why Segwit was implemented and how it follows the white paper. It just adds complexity and risk to what was a very simple protocol that worked well for a long period of time.

Finally. A comment that Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Segwit supporters can agree on.

What would the transaction fee be for a 12kS transaction for a chocolate bar with segwit? What if we have lightning network?

Yes I have heard of Gyft but I am trying to find some places that directly sell from their own websites. Some newer ones. Gyft has been around for some time.

Anything really. Just not sure what is out there. Furniture,  clothing, or art.
I mean, it seems no one grassroots is actually trying to use it as a medium of exchange. Doesn’t bitpay have tons of vendors?
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:51:32
I hear ya. I just don’t understand how there are not many plain old online clothing stores that accept bitcoin (as well as visa, MasterCard, PayPal, etc.). There are MANY online clothing store you know?

I've always wondered what would happen when the blockchain became multiple terabytes and beyond. It is inevitable. 
To me I could care less about miner profitability, I am more concerned with the blockchain becoming less distributed and less people having a copy of the whole thing.  Would this not inevitably bring us to people screwing with the chain to benefit themselves.

I agree.  
One interesting bit I found was this, "Currently, virtual currency that interacts with state currencies poses no risks, since such money creation is at a low level. Moreover, the interaction of Linden dollars, Bitcoin and similar schemes with the real economy is low because those currencies are used infrequently, by a small group of users, and—most importantly—their use is dispersed geographically, across many state currencies, hence the impact on any one state currency is negligible."

I thought it was interesting how he said you could give it to your wife as a necklace, and how it would bring a smile to her face. Also interesting was how he picked up on how bitcoin can be copied (ie. litecoin, fastcoin, shitcoin). I kinda buy his intrinsic value argument. 
But the most interesting part was how he talked about the owners of dotcoms (that did not even sell as they thought the party would go on forever) were only ever millionaires on paper. 
Great interview !

I see that you can decrypt it with bitaddress.org. 
Are there any other ways to decrypt it?

i use the importprivkey in the qt console and it says that it is Invalid private key (code -5).
How is the layman supposed to import a BIP0038 private key?
