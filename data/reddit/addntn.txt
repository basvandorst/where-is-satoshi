don't forget to find a secure, safe place to store your seed. that's the most important thing. use a pin you won't forget.
fyi, keeping your wallet in a box with a copy of the seed is NOT SECURE. storing a picture of your seed online is NOT SECURE.

My bank has a camera inside the vault. I guess anything could happen but if you go down that road, there is no safe physical place to store your seed.
You could memorize it and destroy all copies. Then the only way it can get out is if a hacker dumps it off you trezor or you divulge them.

@_date: 2017-09-20 20:18:19


i have my seed in a sealed security envelope in a safe deposit box in my credit union's vault that only i have a key for and that only i can access via palm print reader. that's how i know my crypto (ie, my private keys) is safe.
i keep my ledger at my office in an unlocked drawer. it's more or less unhackable, so no worries.
the hardware is irrelvant because you can always use your seed to move your private keys to a new device. if 10 years goes by and either lost my ledger, forgot the pin, or it stopped working i can just get a new hardware wallet and use my seed to move the private keys over to it.
PS: i returned my trezor unopened and got a ledger nano s. i was lucky to get my trezor after that whole "hardware hack" thing came out. imo, that hack meant you can't trust trezor hardware to be secure if it's not kept secure (ie, on your person or in line of sight at all times). the hardware of a nano s has been tested to be unhackable. nothing secure leaves the device, is shared with the computer or even connected to a computer when you plug in a ledger.

ok, in this universe, nearly everything is infinite. Except bitcoins.

They can already do this, by setting up their own ticket exchange and accepting paypal payments or just having a CC clearinghouse account.
I think that the venues actually make more money selling through ticketmaster, even though it costs their customers more. I recall reading about booking deals TM has with venues and labels, which work in everyone but the artist's and customer's favor. Of course, the only two people in the transaction that are there for anything other than profit are the watcher and the performer (most artists, imo)..

Did he just claim gold was finite? Like there is only so much of it that can be put into circulation? Because that is just wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:13:31
i understand your conjecture. "Space is vast, and a long time ago, there was a finite amount of mass injected into it." Which goes on to extrapolate that therefor there must be a finite amount of any one given form of mass.
if the number of atoms in the universe is finite, is that true for the number of subatomic particles? Are there finite quantities of electrons, protons and neutrons?
Can i not take 79 hydrogen atoms and squish them together to make one gold atom? Did you factor that into your calcs?
Furthermore, all this is based on the law of conservation of mass, in the sense that you can't create new matter, you can only convert between different types of matter. But given our elementary understanding of the nature of the universe, energy, matter, time, and gravity (all of which may be CLOSELY tied together), we only assume this law to be absolute, because we haven't observed anything that violates it, that we can't explain away. But we have only observed something like 1.0x10^-1000 of our galaxy, with takes up 1.0x10^-1000 space in the universe.
So yeah, i'm still feeling like the number of btc that is possible is way more defined than the number of gold atoms, which is in constant flux anyway, due to stardeath and stargenesis. In the sense that gold supply is undefined compared to the bitcoin, so imo, it would be invalid to assume that it is strictly defined.
In the sense of gold that is in the market, that can be used as currency, then gold is somewhat finite, at least until we find a way to mine the gold in siberia, northern finland and northern sweden. but no matter how hard we work, there will be no more bitcoins after all of them are created.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:22:03
what? you are claiming gold is finite, yet providing no proof. Yet me claiming that the lack of finite proof of limit of gold means it should be considered infinite, and that, imo, the supply of gold is as limited as the supply of any other element, which are approx infinite, since we can't begin to know how much is on our planet, let alone the universe.
It seems to me that you are the one in the teapot, so i will no longer try to convince you that i'm not.
What does it matter anyway? right now, NEITHER of those currencies or commodities is FINITE, since we seem to currently be adding to the supply of BOTH.

What rate were you paying for a 3x margin on btc-e? Was this cash to btc? If so what was the minimum collateral for that extension?
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:14:36


So are you saying i'm the one claiming "there's a teapot around saturn" by saying gold is infinite or are you the one by claiming it is finite?
It's relevant, because every oz of gold that is introduced into the market, dilutes the value of every other oz that is currently in circulation. Until it is prohibitively expensive to mine any more gold, then it is NOT FINITE.
Now i will give you that there may currently be a finite and known amount of gold in circulation, but attempting to claim that gold itself is finite is RIDICULOUS.
people make the asteroid analogy as some sort of proof that even if gold is infinite, it's cost to gather outside of earth is prohibitive, but history has shown that valuable commodities always find the most efficient path to market.

No. You should be learning how to learn and learning how best to serve society. The examples you have change nothing, I didn't say that teens were stupid, I said you make bad decisions and it's not your fault. That very comment of your's proves my point. A hasty off point rebuke that was written impulsively based off the emotion your felt from what I wrote.
Don't get angry, I'm not. This is biological and natural. It's only now, in the information age, and somewhat before during the late industrial age, that teens were able to cause mass harm or injury to anyone besides themselves, their family, or other children.
Since the impact of these mistakes can follow you forever and/or harm a lot more people, I jokingly suggested locking you all up. But make no mistake, in my eyes none of you are special and have special needs, other than a need for stricter rules, that reflect the reality of what your mistakes can do to you once you enter adulthood and are legally bound to societies rules.

One man's "unsupported assumptions, nonsense and imo" is another man's proof of infinity.
I am not familar enough with mathmatics to be able to mathmatically explain the falsehood in assuming that gold is finite. and i was logically wrong in assuming that since it's obviously NOT finite, in the same sense that BTC is, that is must be infinite, when in fact, it is merely "undefined".
But just as undefined =/= infinite, undefined =/= finite. You need to realize that in the absence of a direct argument about the existence of something, it is appropriate to argue about the impossiblity of things NOT being that way.
EG, a minister claims that God exists, without proof and is accepted by everyone. A philosopher attempts to prove that god is false, but has no proof of his assertion, so he proves that the universe and everything can be done without some holy ghost pulling the strings, by demonstrating that somehow.
i mean, this analogy is bad, because you have got me trying to prove the teapot doesn't exist, while you assert that because there little evidence to prove my point, i must conceit that it does exist.
You really should read about that teapot again. and be sure to keep all "true scotsman" fallacy out of your critique of others proof, because no one is gonna argue with you, if you claim to wish to avoid the teapot argument, but utilize the "true scotsman" fallacy to invalid all evidence that supports their position.
in other words, believe what you want, but don't expect others to prove their faith to you when you won't do the same or even try to.
TL;DR: go f*ck yourself, and the horse you rode in on.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:46:17


i fail to see how the one is not implying the other.


I get it. What i don't get is why either of you think that some how that implies it is finite compared to BTC. BTC is absolutely defined, unlike the supply of gold. That supply is defined by what is already being traded (the known portion) plus a speculation of what remains to be added to the supply (the unknown). How does a known+unknown=KNOWN?
and don't apologize, because you're not sorry, you are just insisting on your beliefs, while i insist on mine.
In either case, this article (aka THE POINT) is wrong on that point, because NO ONE can claim gold is FINITE, to the same knowable extent as BTC, which is what the author did, which was my point, which both of you failed to grasp.
