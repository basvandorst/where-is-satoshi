My 5 sat/byte transaction (pending from Dec 24, 2017) confirmed yesterday.
Good things come to those who wait :)

Looking forward to Bech32 support. My Electrum wallet feels lonely :)

If it's Bitcoin Core, then just try opening the wallet there.

It's a wallet from which application?

Is the withdrawal to a Visa card or SEPA transfer?
They had some problems with Visa lately (even sent email to everybody) and SEPA transfer may take 10 days or so.
In general, they are overwhelmed with all new people registering and they are understaffed to handle this kind of volume. And it’s holidays so...
I had great experience with cex.io until recently. But that’s mainly because of their Visa issue (I only use Visa deposits).

Wait, you said it was an old wallet file. If it's that old, it's likely a Bitcoin Core wallet. There weren't that many options back then...
At least, it's a starting point.
Who owns the wallet? The owner should be able to tell you. If not, then you probably have bigger problems. How will you open the wallet if it's password protected?

Apart from investing what you were not supposed to, your even bigger mistake was to cash out.
You know that next year BTC is going to skyrocket, right?

If you head over to r/shapeshiftio you will read horror stories.
Basically, they are way over their heads due to high demand, lack of liquidity and their support is struggling.

I have been using cex.io without problems.
It is highly recommended that you keep the wallet and exchange separate. Install Electrum as desktop wallet. It is the best one out there and supports Trezor/Ledger Nano hardware too.

Apart from hardware wallet (the best option), you could use Electrum. It's a very good and secure wallet (which also supports hardware wallets).
Only downside, it's not very noob-friendly.

What you read is true. If you have the private keys, you can import them to any wallet. No need for a password.
