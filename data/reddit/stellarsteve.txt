For the uninformed:
This is the only TA I you should use.
Sentiment analysis. 
Uses Volatility, Social Media, Market Dominance, and Surveys to drive the metric of sentiment.
The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreations. There are two simple assumptions:
Extreme fear can be a sign that investors are too worried. That could be a buying opportunity.
When Investors are getting too greedy, that means the market is due for a correction.

Exactly..plus he looks like Gandalf...and he didn’t tell me to “fly you fool..”
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:06:03

@_date: 2019-06-16 04:23:11
Hah!! It costs only .1 BTC for that one
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:48:18
Hey guys.  Yea.. the clouds are fake and added after.
Photo is retouched.  Did I say it’s supposed to be a real? Just a cool shot with my nephew and I. *shrug*
Guys what.. spoiler.  The Avengers movie is fake!  They did some retouching...Not sure what you are supposed to mean?
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:52:27

Yea sure...  we took a photo, and the sky was ugly..so we added a nicer background to it.
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:54:00

@_date: 2019-06-16 12:09:25
here is another photo from the shoot.. with the original sky
So we can all stop circle-jerking about a photoshop? It clearly makes for a better picture...and that was the point right?

Amazing!  I do love having a stick-shift car...but, cant complain.  All-Wheel drive version.. sticks to the road so great in this Miami rain.
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:53:19
Nah I just sold it to give you Reddit Silver
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:55:02
Holding too big of a bag. Off balance....  time to dump it I guess
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:41:07
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:54:42
Thanks!!  Maybe if it goes parabolic again, I’ll get a moon-mclaren to match ..
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:53:04
That’s my little nephew Deacon. I got him a Red Lamborghini kids car as a free add-on when I purchased my Huracan.  It was a great Christmas gift :)
My girlfriend took this photo of us. Her Instagram is: 
And note.. I do hold a large bag, but I haven’t sold any in years. I was able to purchase this car because I am a very successful Cybersecurity Professional (Ethical hacker) and also invest well....
Don’t need a moon Lambo...already have one, but I’m still in BTC for the long haul!
Edit: 
the photo is totally not retouched. I promise it’s just a coincidence that this picture happens to look just like the sky in my pic: 
Come on guys.. did I say it was a “real picture” I wanted a nice picture with my baby nephew.  He loved my car, so I got him one for Christmas last year, and wanted to capture the memory. The sky was ugly, so my girlfriend  shopped it for me.  kill me.

@_date: 2019-06-16 12:47:03
Yea that’s what I mean.. I love driving a stick shift, but still can’t complain this doesn’t have one..
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:02:04
Can I pick the tool?  I choose to be a “saw” cause I wanna play a game with you. :)
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:07:58
..man.. has become one of the most toxic subs on reddit....  cant post anything here unless its a rollercoaster gif, a vegeta meme, or how much you lost..
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:06:16
i bought it...and im not asking for handouts..its a joke, because it has a QR code for a my public address i sent to the watch maker
@_date: 2018-12-30 02:23:41
Awesome, thanks for the answer. So, should I not cash out ALL my Crypto and only enough to take a $3000 loss?
Here’s my exact amounts:
Purchased: $3,000 ETH, $3000 XRP and $6000 BTC. Around early September.
Total of $12000
Current value of Portfolio is; $7,500
That’s $4500 in losses.
What’s the best way to do this to get the maximum amount without moving all my assets off?
