this is very ture. i contacted my cousin who is a stock market guy about seven months ago to ask him his thoughts on BTC. he proceeded to shit all over it, but guess who contacted me last week asking questions?

i bought in at 11k with $1000 and don't regret it one bit. I am actually kind of mad that i didn't do the research myself years ago on this tech because the more i learn about it the more money i want to throw into it

Recently bought a ledger nano s, still have yet to set it up completely. But I’m wondering how I can send from my GDAX or CB account to this wallet. Also, if it doesn’t actually store anything but the keys, can I still trade on GDAX when my coins are on this new wallet? Guess I’m just having a tough time understanding how I can continue to trade on these platforms if my money is on this hardwallet. Will I need the ledger everytime I make a trade or buy more coin on an exchange?

i tried to look up my cold wallet address on blockchain.info but it says zero balance but on my ledger nano it shows the balance. does blockchain.info only show balances of electronic wallets?
