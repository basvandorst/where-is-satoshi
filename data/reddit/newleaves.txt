It'll stay underground. If it was really going to take off it would have already. It's  to complicated for the layman to understand.

Why do you want to buy bitcoin? Are you trying to save for the future? Are you looking to buy something with bitcoin or are you just looking to make a quick buck? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:53:55
Neither does "paypal" or "google checkout". So what?
@_date: 2013-03-01 00:04:25
An overwhelming majority of people invested into bitcoin are borderline delusional. Dont take it personally.

I've been thinking the same thing recently. It really makes the people who thinking bitcoin's are going to be worth &gt;$1,000 look even more silly. You transferring all of that money is visible for everyone to see.

They dont even take paypal.

[It's only the begning.](
This is horrible for something marketed to be a "currency". These erratic fluctuations are not in the best interest of bitcoin. Sure you get the headlines, but at the end of the day it's never going to really catch on if this keeps happening.
@_date: 2013-03-01 04:26:13


It is. It's a commodity that used in many manufacturing goods. It's also a physical malleable good that generations of humans have recognized as valuable. 


You have it completely backwards and even you know it by comparing it to gold earlier. Gold used to be used as a currency as you know which caused it to eventually be used as a savings mechanism. The bitcoin market is pure speculation. No one is putting their savings into it to hedge against inflation. It's just not a safe investment by any means. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:03:03


Bitcoin is not a resource.

that's a 27% drop.
@_date: 2013-03-31 20:30:37
The fact that's it's widely recognizable, physical, and has thousands of years of human history behind it as being valuable.

DOW 36,000 is much more likely then bitcoin $500. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:16:03
Why do you think?
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:57:24
No, long term the speculation will slow the growth of bitcoin as a currency. Bitcoin will only grow in value if people spend it for goods and services. I'm sure there are a lot of people who are kicking themselves for spending Bitcoin last month when they could have just used paypal.

It seems like we're going through exactly what happened back in 2011. Bubble, crash, then bitcoin goes back underground and lays low for a few months. We're in the crashing phase. plan on buying when it goes back to &lt;$50

Trying to spread to awareness of it as a currency and get more online services to accept it instead of trying to make a quick buck off it at the expense of bitcoin's integrity.

Sorry, but this doesn't belong here.

I was wondering how long it would be before someone decided to do a bitcoin documentary. I dont have any real advice but you should interview the guy who paid for his pizza 3 years (was it that long ago?) with 10,000 bitcoins. The famous bitcoin pizza guy.

Possibly, however a lot of internet companies use DDOS attack as a cop-out for poor service.

Going to be the voice of reason here and say, no. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:18:47
I disagree with both of those, and I'm pretty bearish on bitcoin prices. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:01:25
Not worth it imo. Running 24/7 for a month (electricy costs x_x) you'll be lucky to get 1 bitcoin.

I agree, that's only because it's established it's self over thousands of years as being valuable and reliable. 


Bitcoin has not even come close to beginning to reach that point.

interesting, but how would you prevent streamers from being DDOS'd?
@_date: 2013-03-27 06:50:10
Impossible to calculate. Even if they did they wouldn't share it. I'm sure there are some people making once in a life time type money off this bubble. That's for sure.

If you're using BTC to make a quick buck then wait for the correction, which it is due for. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:50:54
Gold is easily recognizable, has withstood the test of time, and has a history of being an established currency. Right now it wouldn't be wise to begin to compare the two.

It's impossible to predict with any certainty, but yes. It's going to make it a lot harder for people to get into mining and therefor get into bitcoin. The thing that really got me interested in bitcoin two and half years ago was the fact that I could mine with my gaming PC, even now it's not even worth it for me to try.

i dont know why people keep saying this has to do with Cyprus, it doesn't. They're just trying to pin some real world event and give any explanation to the rise in price other than a bubble.

Easter holiday is coming up. Because of this the Easter bunny has to sell some of his bitcoins in-order to get more fiat Easter eggs (lol i'll take bitcoin over fiat any day, right guys?). I think the Easter bunny should just give out bitcoins instead.  
@_date: 2013-03-01 07:24:02


I agree


I'd argue that the price needs to stabilize before this can happen. Why would I want to pay my employee or who would want to be paid in something that's so volatile. Some people on here and on bitcoin forums? Absolutely. But for 99.9% of people. No way.

@_date: 2013-03-08 22:11:00
Just save it. You really are that eager to sell something that took you 3 months to acquire for just a quick $50? Just encrypt it and back it up somewhere. Four or five years from now it'll be worth a hell of a lot more. Really dont have a lot to lose.
And no. Selling bitcoins on ebay is not that great of an idea although I've done it before just fine. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:24:59


If you really believe that then the difference of 10 dollars shouldn't mean a heck of a lot.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:16:50
People will come to their senses and try to recoup some of their losses. The sell off will slow down and continue for a few months till new infrastructure is implemented then well go through this whole process again.

Thank you very much 
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:24:30
The reasons people come up with for the price going up and down rappidly are getting better and better. ANYTHING but the fact that it's in a bubble. I'm waiting for someone to post how the Supreme Court ruling on Gay Marriage as been effecting the price.

I think many of the people jumping in now will get a hold of their bitcoins then they wont know what to do with them. When the ASIC miners eventually get their machines I'm afraid many of them will try to recoup their losses as quickly as possible by selling as fast as they can while the price is still up.

This is the  problem with bitcoin. People are trying way to hard to make a quick buck off it or using it to "hedge against inflation" which is absurd. Bitcoin needs to become an established currency with a strong infrastructure for years before it can be taken seriously as any kind of investment. Look around at all the bitcoin forums. The amount of discussion regarding trying to make as much money as possible off it outnumbers any discussion about actually using it.

Doing that will only give it more attention and more validation. They're better of just letting it go. If anything they'll attack the exchanges.

They won't. It'll only add legitimacy to bitcoin, which they don't want.
