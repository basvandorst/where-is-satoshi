HODLing and play trading now. Set a sell order at 18k... On GDAX... A real ine
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:18
Americans waking up to BTC as an asset. Mainstreaming effect.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:10
Had a sell in at 18k right before it blew a gasket... No idea if it filled
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:28
This is why we can't have nice things!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:16
GDAX just blew through 17000 on way to 18k
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:57:00
They verified me last week in about an hour. No hassle.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:14:34
Yes... I have normal peeps sharing their buyins on Facebook.
We have reached a tipping point.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:45:15
It's not a crash, it's XMas profit taking on thin volume...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:19
If cashed out, no worries buy back in at 15k and change pants
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:30
Mainstreaming... It has hit the Facebook crowd.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:58:12
Exactly, BTC is becoming a mainstream asset.
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:19:26
No issues with ROI... Just concerned if they have been hacked.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:35:01
It takes a long time... Always has.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:32:50
I use Genesis and Hashnest. But as always caveat emptor.
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:45:39
Only with Hashnest (the Antminer Peeps) and Genesis. But even with them remember ROI is at least 12-18m. Any company that tries to show you anything different is definitely a scam. Even with these companies you have to know the risks such as electric pricing in China for Hashnest. You also have to leverage your equipment with Hashnest as you are buying Hash from specific equipment.  
Also do due diligence. Cloudminr.io was noted as a scam in the mining community way before they walked away with the BTC. 14 BTC was brutal. I am really sorry.
I learned the hard way with the stock market at the end of the tech boom... Always always always diversify and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Genesis is legit. If you want to just do it short term, Hashnest run by Bitmain is the way to go. Like any investment, you have to be patient. To get into black on ROI takes appx. 1 yr. As with any investment, caveat emptor.

ROI is 12-18m but the price run-up will shorten that. I only use Genesis and Hashnest for mining.  But as always make yourself aware of market risks and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

How about investigating all of those shady bank accounts and dealings in fiat banks? If they legit want to go after fraud they might start there!
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:55:11
If they don't try to deal with it now, BTC will simply go dark fully. We are headed there anyway with bit tumble and other tech coming online. Untraceable crypto will continue to grow alongside BTC regardless. 
Same rules of investing apply to BTC. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose and always diversify.
For example, I invest in cloud mining as opposed to BTC as a Forex play. I almost solely look for ROI. Sometimes I hold BTC. Sometimes I sell.

Looks like they are cloning MPESA from East Africa
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:08:56
You could always incorporate.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:10:55
Monero, Dash, or DigitalNotes
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:07:15
Buy cloud mining capacity from Genesis or Hashnest and get your ROI in about 1-1.5yr. be patient and don't price speculate. Are you in it for coin, or speculation? If the later, there are easier ways to gamble with your money.
@_date: 2016-12-28 00:28:26
Happened to me about a year ago. Just carefully follow the instructions on resetting Authy. Then be careful how and which 2FA you use in the future. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 06:40:52
Why my mining proceeds don't go into Coinbase now. Only using them now as a kind of transactional depot occasionally.
@_date: 2016-12-28 00:31:41
Works great in Africa.  Also, not new tech. East Africa has been using MPESA over the phone for years while we barbarians in the West continue to use 1970's tech plastic cards.

I can't believe people are actually making decisions about position based on anything that comes out of Dimon's mouth.  =Buying opportunity
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:08:11
Extremely long position, actually made money on hash sale... I do like their mining, but there's just too much up in the air about China right. They are a great service, I would gladly reinvest if things settle down again.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:22:59
Bitcoin doesn't care about ANY Central Bank.  Remember that people. That's the whole reason we are here!
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:29:24
As far as I know as long as I have access to my private keys which you can do through mycelium I can setup my new BCC wallet wallet when I am ready.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:49:28
Not necessarily... Removed my BTC from Coinbase this morning. Perfect transaction no delays to Mycelium.
