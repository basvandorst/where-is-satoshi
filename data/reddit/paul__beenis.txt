That's not necessarily true either, because you pay taxes on what you make on top of the investment, not on the investment itself. For example, you put $5k into Bitcoin, pull out when it's worth $8k, then you pay taxes on the capital gains only, or $3k. Basically, you're not getting taxed on the money you've already been taxed on, just what you make on top of it.

Bitcoin Core isn't just the people using it, it's the people developing it and pushing it as well. So if Wal-Mart started calling their tissues Kleenex, that would be malicious and against the law. Bitcoin is not trademarked so it is not against the law, but asserting the coin you develop is Bitcoin when that's not the general consensus of the network would probably be considered malicious, right?
I'm not saying that untrained people calling other crypto bitcoins is malicious. A grandparent telling their grandkid "I've been hearing about a lot of new bitcoins popping up recently" would not be malicious, just unintentional misinformation, nothing wrong with that. But when a group of people is openly saying that a different coin with different nodes running different code is the real Bitcoin network... I think that's what the person you were replying to is saying.

Bitcoin Cash is not in the same vein as the other cryptos you mentioned. I've never heard anyone refer to Litecoin or Monero as Bitcoin. Even so, it would be similar to calling store-brand tissues Kleenex, just like you were so snidely trying to allude. 
The only problem with that comparison is that those products didn't change their name just because it became the general term. I don't understand why Bitcoin would be any different... Unless you think Kleenex should become Kleenex Kore
