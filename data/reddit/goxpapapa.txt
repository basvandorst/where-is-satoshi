That's very counter-intuitive. 
If we assume that merchants wait for confirmations on transactions &gt; $100, then I whole-heartedly agree with you.

Cool, how about also including like 100 Satoshis ($0.00043)?  
That should add only dust to the total price, and also give the kids enough denomination that they can do some serious swapping. Maybe they'll start their own businesses among each other and learn that way too. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:49:57
So, you're wrong. 
Mt. Gox refused to let people withdraw their $$ before any of this fiasco even started -- that's why the $/BTC price on Mt. Gox was always so much higher than anywhere else. Add to that terrible customer support, ridiculously long wait times, listing prices as mBTC instead of BTC, and you have a website that deserves to be pushed aside for a company with way better resources, like coinbase or kracken.

Until he legitimately runs away with people's money, any move like this is irrational and preemptive.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:37:43
Not as likely as you might think.
The ~4% fee charged by credit card companies is generally used to refund money to the consumer or merchant after acts of fraud by either party. While the Bitcoin protocol itself can operate with ~1% fees, when Circle offers a money-back guarantee for all transactions, it becomes essentially the same as a credit card company, and will need similar fees to operate accordingly.
I like to think it'll be a *little* bit cheaper on the fees, but not by much. Some competition from coinbase would hopefully prove me wrong.
edit: All bitcoins stored on Circle's website are insured by Circle. I took this to mean that transactions are insured as well, but perhaps that was wrong of me.

Nope, I just gave an example to display the feasibility of my idea. Yes, you would need to download a Chrome/Firefox app to see the Satoshi count, but it wouldn't be RES.  You would not need to download this app I'm coding to earn tips, but you would need to download the app to display, give, and cash-out tips.

Interesting, I don't mind Satoshi having his coins though. His white paper was public knowledge before Bitcoin was even released. Sure, he got ahead early on mining, but he wasn't nearly as ahead as other digital money inventors were.

I use a Chrome app called 'Reddit Enhancement Suite'. It takes advantage of the Reddit APIs to display the following next to each post:
In this image, you can see your post on this thread. Next to your username is a 'tag' that I added, ("Asked a question on my Satoshi count thread"). Additionally, you can see the number of your posts upvotes (2) and downvotes (0). These two functionalities should be enough to calculate upvotes and display a Satoshi count too.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:05:19
This image is entirely due to the fact that the unit of currency in Dogecoin is 1 Doge (~$0.0013). Here in Bitcoin world we maintain that our unit of currency costs ~$650. If we could just Goddamn switch to the mBTC already, we would be psychologically inclined to spread the wealth not just in Reddit, but all over Twitter, Facebook, etc.

No. You're wrong.
1 Satoshi is 0.00000001 (eight decimal places)

? But your point is invalid? Why would people pay 1,000s uBTC when the mBTC conversion is much closer to the dollar? Not only that, the microBTC is much closer to BTC's current maximal decimal place of eight. In other words uBTC goes down to the 6th decimal place, while BTC can only go to eight. mBTC is perfect for now because it matches the dollar and there are still so many fractions.

Let's not forget that Bobby Lee upped his transaction fees a few weeks before China made their announcement and Bitcoin took a plunge. I don't have respect for this guy. 
edit: ...People are misinterpreting this... To clarify, it is well known that Bobby Lee had met with Chinese government officials in the weeks prior to the crash. Allegedly, when his meetings didn't go as he expected, he raised his transaction fee giving the general public some BS reason, and a few weeks/days later, China made their announcement, and the price plunged. This made him money because 1) he knew from his meetings that China wasn't gung ho about Bitcoin 2) he knew that as the price plunged, people would be transacting Bitcoin on his exchange.. duh.

So maybe for someone with good credit in a well-equipped country, cash may be already meaningless. But for the rest of the world, the only solution is bitcoin.

It's counter-intuitive and not aesthetically pleasing. As science-minded individuals, we might be use to decimals and all those zeros, but an uneducated individual will make the relation to dollars much more easily when it's put in terms they can understand, such as mBTC.

Recently a competition at MIT was held in which the winning prize was a replacement for advertisements on the web using Bitcoin. 
I think the concept was basically that as you visit certain websites, your computer acts as a Bitcoin miner in the background, and all the bitcoin that you mine immediately is transferred to the website you're visiting.
Basically, you're paying the website using your internet connection for the amount of time you spend on it. Genius =)

Cool, thanks, that's what i figured. 
same to you @_date: 2014-02-18 16:51:57
Although I disagree with you I respect this argument. For me it's more important for Bitcoin to take off because I know it provides significant advantages for developing countries and my own investment.

But this is more as incentives to get Bitcoin to catch on. I'm fearful that vendors will be reluctant to charge less for Bitcoin in the same way that many shops are reluctant to charge less for when people pay in cash. 
Other than gas stations, do you know anywhere that charges less for cash? Because I don't.

Why wouldn't merchants lower their fee to below their competitor's by allowing someone to pay in BitCoin?
YOU IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!

Why can't I see my bitcoins in the electrum app? I'm using my online PC, and blockchain.info says there are bitcoins in my account (12BnfxFCw9fg3V6on2jHdAfPnQYrSwT1Gh). This is one of the same receiving addresses that Electrum has listed, but there's no bitcoins listed in Electrum. Even though there are bitcoins listed in blockchain.
Do i need to do something to "Refresh" Electrum in my online, "watching" wallet?
