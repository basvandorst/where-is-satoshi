Nop. But i don't need to trust them. I trust the people who mine there not to be stupid enough to let them reach 51%.

Though technically what you are saying is correct. These so called 51% attacks that pop up from time to time do not help to establish the credibility of bitcoin with people who understand less about the technical side of it.

I agree with you completely. Regulating pool size would have nothing do with how bitcoin operates, and with be nothing but beneficial to the health of the network.

I am not a coder, (expect for way back in the 90's when i wrote using pascal and c) and do not know what can be achieved and what can't. but  in my opinion, although it might be a too radical solution, when it comes to mining in a pool, i don't think it should be up to people to select which pools to mine in. the system itself should direct a miner to which pool to go to. i have no idea if this is even possible or desirable by the community. but this is my opinion.

Let me understand. In essence you are promoting bitcoin, which is a decentralized, trustless, automated network whose sole purpose is to achieve consensus without the need to trust a single person in the process. Yet are willing to trust a centralized entity with the human factor in the background, which we know less about than north korea, and can have complete omnipotence and control, and the potential to basically undo everything which we have achieved so far with the click of a button. Great going dude. Keep up the good work. You're really helping...

Satoshi, for all his accomplishmens and foresight, must have seen the centralization of mining. And the danger it will pose to bitcoin. I wonder why he didn't limit mining to CPUs when he first wrote the code. I mean it would have made perfect sense to do so, since it would have fit perfectly with the decentralization nature of bitcoin.

Me and my wife (chinese btw) live in china and do all our trading in China. It is still possible to deposit CNY into the exchanges. Just not directly to their account. China often does this kind of stuff. They come up with regulations knowing that there is viable way to circumvent them. They just look the other way. As a ground rule never literally take what china says as black and white.

In essence, you transfer money to an intermediary who than updates your account with the ammount you deposited. it is a little more of a hassle since you need to phyisically do a bank transfer, where as before you just used services like alipay to transfer your funds online. however, since the intermediary is third party that works for the exchange, it is still as if you transfered your money into the exchange itself. 
the funny thing about china is that, the exchange itself publishes all the info you need to inform you how to continue to do business with them. as if the goverment doesn't know. that's why nothing in china is what it seems. of course they know. they just do their civic duty and turn a blind eye to the whole thing. most probably because the officials in charge themselves invest in bitcoin.

You say what is the purpose. And that's a valid question. But this is china, and their logic isn't ours. In many cases, they care about the bottle. Not the wine inside.
