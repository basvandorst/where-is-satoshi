So i should short milk? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:39:56
Just get in man, stop waiting there's only 11 or 12 million coins out there and a lot of them are being held by hodlers. this is the future.. and you are still an early adopter, these coins will be worth $250,000 and more before you know it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:39:30
 Where can I sell mine?
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:28:30
Marketing lol. They all have more business than they can handle. Polo is purposely giving bad(no) service to get a bad reputation to keep the minnows away. They want whales only.

Was there any warnings from the community to others? If no, why not? Can we start a list? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:03:35
The banks have to buy a shit ton of btc to allow traders to short it, correct?
Shorting BTC rt now takes balls of steel

Should we create a list of bitcoin exchanges, mining companies etc.. that have not publicly revealed who owns them or have other red flags to sticky on this subreddit?

Pentester here. I'm calling inside job. Most large services keep the vast majority of their BTC in cold storage. CoinBase, for example, only keeps 2% of their coffers out of cold storage, and that 2% is insured. You're really going to hope people are niave enough to think you accidentally left literally all of the BTC online, uninsured, and unsecured? You're also expecting me to believe you had zero safeguards against 61 million dollars transferring to one single address, and then you claim you're running maintenance on the site. You also push more people to using your online wallet by offering discounts on transaction fees. How fucking retarded do you think people are? This is either plainly criminal, or plainly incompetent. Either way, you guys are morons. Glad I never used you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:17:09
Correct me if this is wrong. Have BTC on GDAX send to another wallet. I sent 2 days ago and it was an $18.23 fee that GDAX covered.
Send back to GDAX for a dollar or two... rinse and repeat. Do this enough times with enough people going to cost them some serious money. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:50:32
Btc is becoming one of the rarest items on the planet. Im going all in : )
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:26
Lol what a noob
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:31:19
 But what if i want to buy more? Cash out and then buy more? Does not compute 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:02:36
Sell the dips!! Panic, panic, panic!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:47:19
But if i take that $500 profit and put it back into btc the cash out is pointless. Im never going to spend my cash outs, that's my investment funds. And im looking to get more btc not less. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:25:00
You tell me what it tells you and then I'll go
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:09:30
Why would they return the coins? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:20:50
I would also like the links if its not too much trouble, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:12:19

Gotcha, so there was a wall of eight million dollars worth of bitcoin with sell orders at that level 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:33:01
Wow you are crushing it!
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:40:14

@_date: 2017-12-09 18:17:08
 And you show your true intentions
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:09:01

 Cool, quick get back in!
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:43:31
Why did they give that $10M away if they are scamming? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:34:04
You seem emotional and jaded causing you to make assumptions. You assumed my comment was out of my ass because that fit your narrative. I was referring to a survey that was published in Nov, that many ppl in here discussed. It interviewed 564 American bitcoin owners. 
84% said they plan to hold at least 1 yr.  44% said at least 4 yrs. 
Even tho BTC was at all time highs, 67% have never sold any of their BTC.
At what price would they be willing to sell ALL of their BTC? Avg answer=$196,165.79
BTC was $6,490 at time of survey. 
I know a lot of ppl who own BTC and they have similar plans. 
Edit: you can't possibly believe there are only a few dozen ppl in this subreddit claiming they are long term hodlers. I would have guessed 90% of the 500k are...haha ok that's maybe a little high
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:34
 ignore the troll
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:38:19
My prediction is 100k within 2 yrs maybe 1
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:15:37
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:11:56
How much are they making per month? If $1M/mo, $60M would be pretty lucrative. Especially when you can start the scam all over.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:05:03
Plenty of instances in the last yr of no correction after dramatic rises 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:35:32
I say 32
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:14:55
Source? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:26:39
Does 30 mins count as stabilisation?....yes, yes it does
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:04:36
Nice try hacker
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:14:25
No one knows for sure but the bottom seems to have stabilized. I just bought and appears to be a great entry point. Delete this reddit account and don't mention big purchases online
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:14:22
Why? Why spend so much money on a car when its such an amazing time to invest in BTC. Or do you feel its close to peaking? That car could cost you $500,000 or more. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:57:06
 thats exactly what they want because they can short the market
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:44:28

@_date: 2017-12-09 21:59:24
I was so close to doing the same. Spoke to someone last nt who is a very successful crypto trader (for years) and has been almost always right on his crypto advice and he says LTC is headed to $500 soon. 85% BTC, 10% LTC, and 5% FCT is his current recommendation. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:05:57
Lol baldy prediction
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:04:25
Wow no one predicted 17,000!

I got in at $250-$9900, still getting in

@_date: 2017-12-12 08:56:25
I respect your opinion and input. Honest question, you seem extremely confident in your ability to predict, why aren't you shorting? 
Also, the supply is so low and such a huge percentage of owners of btc claim to be long term holders. Its a unique market, tough to predict imo
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:59:57
It moves instantly from coinbase to gdax at no cost
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:01:40
You were wrong! Its over 17k
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:12:06
Plus im hearing the owners never revealed their identity. Was the plan all along it seems
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:10:44

Anyone know how long i should expect a transfer of BCH to take between exchanges rt now? Im at 67 mins rt now.
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:00:21
They're payin $100/day/BTC, what a crazy risky play imo. Im one of the lenders
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:01:19
80% of my loans are still active and about to hit a week at 2.5% average rate. Thats 17.5% roi in 1 wk, fingers crossed the loans stay active for a long time. Very happy I sacrificed the BCH, nice! Minnesota nice!
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:31:33
So i left mine in xapo.com, but im not seeing them anywhere in my account do I just have to wait until they create a wallet?

Who owns localbitcoins? Do you have to use any personal info to sign up with them? 
Anyway to find out details of his account based on wallet address alone? Such as what city he advertised in
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:42:50
113 wallets with at least 10,000 BTC or $77M, thats a lot of coins. I wonder if its mostly early adopters or if any of them are the ultra rich getting in recently.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:55:08

@_date: 2017-11-30 17:42:07

@_date: 2017-11-19 06:19:21
There was survey released the other day that found the ppl they surveyed answered $196k would be the number where they would sell ALL their BTC. That was the average answer. A lot of long term hodlers. 
Personally, I'm not selling for a few yrs at least. 
Edit: here it is
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:06:20
Who cares his loss. Or show him how many ppl are signing up on coinbase. The survey showing long term holders making up most of the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:21:08
First time in the history of the internet where i ordered something "free" and i get to checkout and it says no need to enter credit card info because its free. I will now support your site, omw to go shop there rt now. Ty for free sticker too

I would love to know how much Bitcoin they have accepted and if they're hodling?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:24:48
So there is $1.2B worth of BTC on their exchange from people who don't suspect a thing? Scary
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:19:59
And learn to crop photos lol ; )
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:02:26
Why? can they do something to the device to hack you? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:50:39
Or, start a business in the industry. Maybe start an exchange or a BTC consulting business on craigslist
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:38:08
So close!

Wow that is amazing, you are a great son.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:56:11
This is the reason i get shit from all my friends, family, and my business partner for not owning a car.  I have almost no money in the bank and 100% of my investment portfolio in BTC. I am still following the rule of only risk investing what you are okay losing because I have an amazing career and a lot of income coming in in the near future and the rest of my future.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:27:34
I followed thru and supported you by buying the BTC University shirt, 5 dollars shipping wasnt exciting, but everything else was. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:41:29
How long did you hodl it?
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:06:14
Yeah, take this advice. Call them on Monday. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:29:48
I bought a hodlr
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:23:58
 great decision! I did the same with my ETH, LTC, and FCT. Sold them all for BTC about 5 mouths ago. Then a month ago 1 made the mistake of buying some FCT and LTC back. Im 15% FCT 7% LTC and 78% BTC, wish I was lighter on FCT but can't bring myself to sell at loss and one day some crazy good news will come out on FCT.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:38:52
 last time i bought was at 2800 and i keep asking myself why didnt i buy more at 4000,5000,7000, etc...u must be kicking yourself
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:59:58
 Good news is that is an impossible goal rt now, like trying to stop a rolling car at the bottom of a very steep hill.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:40:57

Yeah, exactly

How can i move my wife's ira into btc?
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:55:36
Exactly, how is this difficult to understand? Oh i know how, you are extremely bias towards BCH and you desperately want it to take off. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:52:49
They recently gave ~$10M back to their users when they absolutely didnt have to. That is a strong sign they are in it for the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:28:55
It says 2015 or older, rt?

I lived in a bitcoin my freshman yr
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:14:20
I sold all my gold and silver for BTC a year ago, no regrets. But my timing was lucky. I will be getting back into gold once the world economy dives into the next depression. Rt now ride BTC
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:53:33
I am surprised more companies don't accept BTC. I wonder how much BTC Overstock has and their avg buy price. They have to be loving this decision.

But they only got 800,000 coins
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:51:15
I think winklevoss twins bought $11M at $120 or 92k BTC. That's $712M now, wow.
There supposedly have said they have 1% of all BTCs, which i believe would be 210,000 coins or $1.6B.

The miners are the ones organizing silly
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:46:26
Yeah extremely volatile rt now
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:49:14
Yeah, unfortunately the only answer is spend time making fiat and buy BTC and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:50:41
No, not the same guy

I guarantee veggie_sorry and other noobs had no idea this was the case
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:51:36
Im so smart, I knew BCH was a scam so I dumped mine at $400....oh wait
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:47:35
Being conservative is so weird
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:27:51
For what reason? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:13:55
Nice! You changed to hodl at a great time
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:44:25
I'm just picking smart brains from this thread
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:40:19
I bought in 2015 does that count? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:38:19
Yeah but im making a ton of money lending, approx 3% of my bitcoin portfolio daily. Should be 9-15% gain in 3-5days. Will BCC be worth 9-15% of current BTC value? Maybe, but its a big gamble
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:55:45
I have all of mine out on loan because the rates are amazing. Wonder if I am going to regret it tho because I am sacrificing my bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:34:14
Poloniex..it varies, 4% rt now cuz of fork
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:44:02
Awesome! Its been crushing last cpl wks with no news and I wouldn't be surprised if we get some more good news soon. Im storing all of my factom on poloniex and would like to move some out but keep it as FCT, you have any recommendations? Is it even possible to store FCT outside poloniex? I actually don't know that much about cryptocurrencies. My cousin tells me when to buy and sell and I have more than quadrupled my investment in last yr mostly because of FCT.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:00:13
Sounds like you have done a lot of research.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:17:28
I do have the two factor security with Google authenticator and strong password. I will research papermill wallet and how to do it asap and get 80% of my FCT off Poloniex. Thanks, really appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:06:15
Remindme! 8 weeks
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:32:02
 Thanks!!!
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:46:24
 And his prediction is ETH is a bubble but ride it just a little longer. BTC will be 10k by end of 2018 maybe sooner. And slowly sell FCT on the way up but not yet and not all of it.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:34:03
I agree, love my FCT stake, im about 70% FCT, 15% ETH, and 15% BTC. I will be moving towards 70% FCT and 30% BTC soon.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:08:57
Even factom? Factom has utility 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:14:43
I say diversify into factom, it still has a long ways to run
