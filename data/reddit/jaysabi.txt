The stock market has been on a tear for 7+ years, if you're having trouble breaking even it might be an indication you're trading too much relative to your investment or you're picking bad stocks. The S&amp;P for example has more than doubled since 2011. It's been very hard not to make money.
*Edit: Not saying to be judgmental. My own style of investing is buy and hold good companies. Statistically, the best hedge fund managers in the world cannot reliably beat passive index investing (the market), so there's no reason to think individual traders can do so by day trading. Real wealth creation comes from inactive investment and lots of time.

Because Bitcoin futures are settled in cash and not Bitcoin, the futures do not affect the Bitcoin price. If you're shorting futures at $11,000, the only way you make a profit is if the price closes below $11,000 at settlement time, but your futures trades won't affect the price. There's no way for futures to manipulate the Bitcoin price because the futures mimic the Bitcoin price, not the other way around. 
Futures are only a way for big investors to gamble on the price in a regulated space.

The statement is not to be taken literally since dollars are fungible. "Do you have any dollars printed 100 years ago" is my way of asking who has cash they've sat on for 100 years and never done anything with, because only then would they have suffered a 95% loss of value. The question was rhetorical because of course nobody here does, so nobody has experienced the "loss" the graph is purporting to show. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:37:17
Right, so in order to manipulate the price, they would need to deal in actual Bitcoin. Someone trying to manipulate the price of the actual asset in order to not have to pay out on the future contract is taking on way more risk than by just closing the futures position. 
In short, you're trying to believe that someone is going to put millions of dollars at risk in actual btc in order to try and manipulate the price to the point where they won't lose maybe $20,000 on a futures bet. That makes no sense.

I don't feel that's honest or accurate. The dollar is  more of a store of value than it isn't. We don't have hyper inflation, we have a stable economy (even in recessions), business can be conducted remarkably easily using the dollar because of the predictability of its value. This chart is misleading in that it is factually accurate but leads people to make inaccurate conclusions. Dollars printed 100 years ago have lost 95% of their value. Do you have any dollars that were printed 100 years ago? Does anybody? Commerce and the events in the economy don't happen over long enough periods for this to be near the problem it's being represented to be. 
The USD does not depreciate fast enough to be unstable. Could it be better? Yeah, like anything else it probably could be. Has anyone here held USDs long enough to come anywhere near the amount of loss shown in the graph? I severely doubt it. 
That's not to say it's not a problem, only that it's not the level of problem this chart makes it out to be.

Shiller did not say that he thinks Bitcoin's *bubble* could linger for 100 years. This is a wildly inaccurate headline based on a misunderstanding (willful?) of what he said. 
Actual quote:


What he *actually* said is Bitcoin could collapse and be abandoned (which he views as likely) or it could still exist in 100 years. Completely absent in his statement is any reference to the bubble or price level in 100 years; that's completely and wrongly inferred. In fact, he used the verb "linger" (to stay unnecessarily) instead of something like "thrive" which offers the only clue into his disposition on what he thinks Bitcoin would be like if still existed in 100 years. 
For anyone unfamiliar with Shiller's work, he won a Nobel Prize in economics for his fieldwork on markets' tendency to inaccurately price assets and create bubbles. He called the stock bubble in his book Irrational Exuberance (NYT Bestseller) in 2000.  He wrote a paper about the housing bubble in 2003, long before it was on anyone else's radar. In 2005, he refined his paper to note that the housing bubble bursting could lead to a worldwide recession, and although not inevitable, was far more likely than other economists were recognizing. In 2007, he wrote in the WSJ that the housing collapse was now imminent and predicted large scale financial panic and instability as a result. Almost exactly one year later, Lehman Brothers collapsed and everything that followed proved him right. The Case-Shiller Home price index, was created partly by him. 
So if there's anyone people should listen to about bubbles, Shiller's on the short list. Just listen to what he actually says, instead of making stuff up like the OP did.

Except there's no reason for that to happen since the futures are settled in cash, not Bitcoin. Nobody is trading futures to affect Bitcoin price because the price the futures pay out at are wholly dependent on the btc price. It's a one way street. The only direct link between btc price and futures price is that the price of btc determines how much a futures contract is worth at settlement time, and the settlement is paid in cash, not Bitcoin. If you want to affect Bitcoin price, you do it be dealing in Bitcoin, not a derivative.

You can see the trading volume on CBOE and it is dwarfed by the usd trading volume of Bitcoin itself. What this tells you is that futures are a more shallow market and that it would take **significantly** more money to move the btc price than the futures price.  
$20,000 isn't an exact figure, it was just being used to show that if you have that low of exposure in futures, you wouldn't be able to manipulate the btc price without putting significantly more capital at risk, which defeats the entire exercise in the first place. Also, if the futures contract closes low, you don't lose your entire investment. You could have $200,000 in futures contracts and they close 10% down and that would be a $20,000 loss.

Congratulations on naming three instances in which companies have ignored AML regulations. As I said, when followed, AML regulations cut down on money laundering. Also, where you've named three instances of companies failing to follow regulations, there are hundreds of thousands of daily instances where companies follow the regulations and in so doing, prevent money laundering by making it cost-prohibitive or impossible to launder money through KYC procedures and ID and verification procedures.


That's the point, exactly all the same negative outcomes that occur through fiat currency would occur through a cryptocurrency. The point isn't that a cryptocurrency would be immune to AML considerations, the point is that it's not.


No, insert any government-mandated program that is a net detriment to society but serves some special interest or agenda. It serves a point, just not a good one from someone else's perspective. In this case, the government wants to control currency and banking. Or consider that money laundering itself doesn't hurt anyone, it's the activities that created the funds that require them to be laundered that the government is trying to track and crack down on. Controlling the currency allows them to do that. But the way it's done creates all kinds of other problems which may equate to a net detriment to society. Like the drug war, government thinks it's doing something good, but ignores all the negative consequences of the drug war which makes it a net detriment to society.

Bitcoin became a bubble. The bubble needs to burst before it can become viable, because the value needs to be stable if it's ever going to have a shot at being a currency alternative. No merchant can afford to hold bitcoins when the price is so volatile because it's impossible to conduct business when you don't know the value of your assets, or when they change so rapidly from day to day. Is Overstock holding BTC? I'd be shocked if they didn't immediately convert BTC transactions to USD, otherwise there'd be no way to know if they were making a profit, and with the price swings, increased probability that they wouldn't be. 
This community needs the price to stabilize and the truth is, it's not going to stabilize at $1000 or any other high price that was hit on the upswing, because the money was only flowing in as speculation, not to use bitcoins for commerce. As speculators get burned and leave, the price will come down. This sucks if you bought BTC looking for easy money or investment income, but this is a good thing for BTC, and a necessary thing for it to grow. When, and if, it becomes widely accepted, by millions of merchants, not thousands, the potential is there for it to steadily appreciate in value in a way that won't undermine its benefits of use, but the time horizon for something like that is many, MANY years. The meteoric rise BTC has experienced is bad for the long-term prospects of it.

I can't speak to the effectiveness of NSA spying in preventing attacks, but your first point seems to suggest that AML regulation is not effective in preventing money laundering, and this is unequivocally false. I work for a law firm that trains broker-dealers and investment advisers in AML compliance, and AML regulations *when followed* absolutely cut down on the amount of money laundering that would otherwise take place by requiring financial companies to track the identities of their customers and also currency movements. That's not to say that AML regulations prevent all money laundering, it absolutely doesn't. But it does make it much more difficult than it otherwise would be.
I agree with the rest of your points, and I don't dispute your first point for any purpose other than to speak to what I know. You're not going to get very far trying to convince the rest of the world that Bitcoin is good and should be exempt from AML regulation because AML regulation doesn't work. It does, and it makes the Bitcoin community look that much more like fringe-dwellers when they're advocating for a system that most people don't/can't understand and also disputing as false something that is very evidently effective at combating money laundering. That's not a perception you want to foster.
Now that said, I'm not advocating that AML regulations are necessarily a good thing, or that a slap on the wrist for HSBC was appropriate in light of their willful disregard of AML regulation. But I can tell you, these regulations cut down on money laundering due to the burdens they force financial institutions to place on their customers. You can take issue with whether AML regulation is a net benefit to society, but please don't argue that they're pointless. It's not good for Bitcoin's general perception.

To me it just sounds like you don't know how cash advances on a credit card work. You think people are going to give you better terms if it's denominated in crypto if you're taking out this kind of loan? The fees aren't because the loan is denominated in dollars, the fees are because these types of borrowers are extremely risky and it's an instant access to capital you don't own. You can't even do this type of thing with crypto, so crypto isn't going to solve this particular problem.
@_date: 2019-12-28 04:57:17
The structure of how cash advances work is all there in your credit card agreement, so if it's a surprise to you, you clearly didn't read the agreement you agreed to. It's a boilerplate legal document you were given when you opened the account. I'm sure they can provide you another copy if you request it. That's the contractual bit of it. It sounds like your bank in particular is having trouble communicating as well. That's probably adding to your frustration I would imagine.
As for the logic of why cash advances are treated differently than purchases (essentially, the absence of the grace period for cash advances), it makes perfect sense to me. Cash advance rules are different so that you can't take a cash advance and use it to pay off your credit card balance. If they gave you a grace period for cash advances, you could just take an interest free loan out on your card, use the cash to pay off your previous credit card balance (whether it was purchases or a cash advance), and then roll the loan forward every month for an interest free loan in perpetuity. The way credit cards prevent this is to charge interest from the moment the cash advance is taken and to force you to pay off the entire balance on the card before they credit any of your payments toward the cash advance loan. As for why they would give you an interest free loan on the purchases, there's a decent chance you'll end up not paying the full amount off and then paying interest on the purchases, and even if you pay it off in full, the credit card makes a small fee on every transaction from the merchants. So it's free to you, but the credit card still makes their fee for the service they provide.
My own personal opinion is that crypto is never going to improve upon what credit cards offer as a service. The centralization offers too many benefits for crypto to ever replace it.

Every time this argument gets posted it's automatically false because it wants you to assume a 95% loss of value that never happened. 
If you had a physical dollar 100 years ago, it would be depreciated, yes. But, you didn't have a dollar 100 years ago because you weren't alive 100 years ago. And the people who were didn't hold value in cash currency for 100 years. Nobody lost 95% of their stored value. 
There is no such thing as perfect money. What we have is stable over long periods of time *and due to the nature of value and an inability to reliably store it in this universe, that's the best you're ever going to get.* 
Remember, money itself isn't value. It's a representation of value, meaning it represents real things that are produced and consumed that people want/need. You cannot possibly store more value than what can ever be consumed in the present, so expecting a representation of value that was created 100 years ago to hold perfectly for goods that will no longer exist when it is to be spent is unreasonable. Money depreciates necessarily over time unless we can perfectly store all value ever created, and we cannot. 
The things you have to take for granted to buy this stupid argument are ASTOUNDING.

This is the closest anyone has been able to come to providing evidence Bitcoin is a productive asset, however it still depends on you putting your coins in a LN channel, not from owning the coins themselves. It's much closer, but I would say the actual asset there is the LN channel, not the coins themselves. 
It would be like having a $100 bill. Paper money is not a productive asset. If you put it in the bank and earn interest on it, the asset itself still isn't productive, you're just earning income from it because you loaned it to a bank. The loan is what is producing the income, not the money itself. There's a subtle nuance there, but I think it's important.

No, that is entirely the point. Bitcoin is not a productive asset. 1) There is not income from Bitcoin.

What you have received is additional tokens that are also unproductive assets and also speculatively valued.

I think there's a misunderstanding of what a "productive" asset is. Productive asset = produces income or cash flow. It's not an opinion, it's a factual statement. Bitcoin is an unproductive asset. It produces no income and has no cash flow. None of the qualities you posted changes the fact that Bitcoin is an unproductive asset.
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:27:53
Understood, however two quick points on that: 
1) it's not that there was that much "air" in the market cap, it's that investors priced the stock based on a set of performance metrics and growth trends, and revalued the stock when the metrics were updated on the last earnings call. It's not *necessarily* that the disappearing market cap is the result of a bubble, it's far more accurate to say that the valuation has fallen based on most recent data and performance trends. This is different from a bubble which inflates based on speculation and hype and pops when its own momentum can no longer sustain the growth. For FB, there would be a much clearer case for a "bubble" if it suddenly dropped 20% for no particular reason. There was clearly a reason here, and it was poor performance that altered the underlying investment case. 
2) It's not safe to conclude that because one stock goes down, all stocks must be overvalued. This is drop is evidence FB was overvalued once the new data became available, not that the market as a whole is overvalued. (You could make that case for other reasons, like historical PE ratio, but not this particular event.)

The dollar size is rather immaterial since Facebook is so much larger than Bitcoin's market cap. Does a one day 20% fall (which is likely a knee-jerk reaction from a bad earnings miss) make it a bigger bubble than a sustained 6 month fall of more than 60%? I don't mean to flog a dead horse, but selectively framing the premise as you have is problematic for your assessment, in my own opinion.

I wouldn't count on it. In times of economic uncertainty, people flee risk and move money to safe assets. Bitcoin is the king of speculative assets. If people are losing their jobs and their economic futures are uncertain, they're not going to move their savings into an asset that they can't predict what it's going to be worth. So a recession will probably halt crypto inflows. 
It would be a different question if the dollar collapsed, you might see people attempting to move into something more stable than a collapsing dollar, but as long as the dollar is stable, I would expect a recession in the US to spell bad times for bitcoin. The reason it's different in Argentina and Hong Kong is Argentina's currency is not stable (rampant inflation) and China has currency controls that people attempt to evade with crypto, especially during the Hong Kong protests. 
The key is the stability of the home currency. As long as it's stable, people aren't going to risk their savings on a risky asset when there's economic uncertainty.
