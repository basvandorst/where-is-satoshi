thanks for depressing the price by selling 5K BTC /s

amd that was when the marketing team actually spoke t the dev team wh want nothing to do with BTC while the marketing team are like "but if we just say crypto we will win free users"

what do you think about all the efforts p2p exchanges like paxful have been making to help people on the ground there
[Bitcoin Exchange Paxful Reveals Plan to Reach Venezuela's Unbanked](
as far as I can see they are actually planning to open an office there (maybe slightly risky on their part coming up against the government currency controls?)

Seems ever since they introduced kyc this site has been doing totally downhill
@_date: 2018-08-03 12:30:42
Paxful.com has cash and hundreds of other semi cash methods to buy bitcoin.
For example you can go to a store and buy a walmart gift card for cash and trade the gift card for BTC

Hmm I stopped trading there after [I read some users getting visits from law enforcement.]( 
[Arrested by the police for localbitcoins business](
it seems they will give them your ID and personal info at the drop of a hat.
I'm out of that platform, screw giving LBC MY ID just so they can tell the Tax authorities 
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:43:46
Fully agree, I tried to trade there but then you have an issue where some idiot won't release the funds on their side and you have no moderator or human to step in and be the referee.
For p2p trading paxful works for me since LBC started asking for KYC

its an a/b test by the looks of it as I have the normal title.
most likely they are trying out different terms to see what makes the app appear most in search results and generate more downloads

I dont know how many people use crypto in this market but i KNOW the remittance industry between France and former colonies here is HUGE.
From what i know, expat A will go into a store in france and buy a prepaid visa and sell it to a guy in africa who cant buy things online due to currency controls and online purchase restrictions from banks 
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:21:49
I noticed the volume on localbitcoins is constantly dropping week by week and seems to be going over to paxful where support are a bit more responsive and they actually seem to care protecting their their vendors from scammers
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:33:25
Yo know what I did?
I bought a 500 dollar hotels.com gift card on [paxful.com]( for 30% discount and booked my hotel room with BTC with 30% off retail price o
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:35:47
doesnt LBC have escrow for this reason.
won't they ban his account after he scammed you?
paxful has a bond system that stops vendors scamming for that very reason, "why scam a guy of 200 dollars when you will lose the 1000 dollar bond you needed to become a seller

Funny how this post would never be upvoted if it was a sell order or how people would be complaining how its evidence of manipulation and we need to bring in the feds 
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:01:45
I've a vendor on Paxful, the margins on some payment methods are huge as there is not enough competition so sellers can set the rates. 
basically what im saying is feel free to undercut my offers but reality is prices are set by the market and there is more buyers than sellers therefore sellers can ditate prices.
right now i make 20% margin on gift card trades and 6% on sepa bank transfer (there is far less fraud and chargeback risk here)
unforunatly as a vendor I have to deal with people trying to sell gift cards that were bought with a stolen card and they are later canceled when amazon, for example, gets notified xyz card was bought with a stolen CC  and in the end I have to eat the loss in about 5% of trades 
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:11:27
well I'm not really surprised LBC started losing some of their volume to paxful.
the way they sneaked in that KYC on everyone and locked down funds and closed acocunts of people who couldn't comply. 
essentially they acted as the bartender who asks for ID after everyone has been drinking an a bar for weeks 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:34:08
I usually report these offers when i see them as the guys are usually Nigerian scammers who will make these too good to be true. 
The mods there do what they can to kill these offers when reported but not always

im looking at paxful now and it's like 5% for bank transfer which is pretty much what you pay coinbase after the fees 
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:42:28
Ok so you are mentally challenged as well as arrogant. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:36:50
where do you get off with that sort of arrogance,
its replies like that that lead people to think bitcoin peopel are all a bunch of incel libertarians with nothing but resentment for everyone else 
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:54:44
OK then...... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
my bitfinex account seems to disagree tho

sorry snowflake but when paypal close you they cant steal your money but rather they tie it up for a while and stop taking more payments

just like those antifa terrorists who got their paypal closed yea?

Looking at how you are becoming unhinged publically I can only assume you are one of these anti-pantys types, probably chronically depressed, low self-esteem (I seen 1000 of you)

they dont require you to KYC either

that place is a graveyard tho 
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:41:52
I stopped selling on LBC once they implemented KYC on vendors.
paxful.com is basically the same type of p2p exchange but US based and with better support and interface
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:49:41
its simple, thanks to new google algo updates if you seatch "buy bitocin and click on one of the lower links"" google will over time take them as being more relevant and demote bitcoin.com from number one.
also as an SEO it looks like Ver is running a PVN by linking news.bitocin.com and other subdomins to his main site 
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:04:18
Because when Im in the middle of a P2P trade and some scammer from Nigeria decides he doesn't want to pay me my price he can keep my coins locked down until support answers his complaint.
that is why fast support matters as these players can clock you out of your coins 
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:26:54
and the arbitrator takes time, so if one person is a scammer coins are locked down until a support ticket can be opened. 
This is why I use paxful as their support usually help me within thirty minutes 
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:21:04
I prefer to sell my BTC for gift cards on paxful and that way I can cash out into a nice new drone on my doorstep with a 20% discount on the gift card ;) 
localbitcoins asks for KYC, paxful doesn't but they work on the same principal of P2P markets
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:58:00
Just use Paxful instead 
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:02:57
proof the bch was sold?
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:11:19
 Solution: JUST USE PAXFUL.COM**
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:55:14
Both of those are rubbish compared to paxful who actually have a proper escrow and support desk

I guess it depends where you are, 
Here in europe I go the bank branch and lodge my rent into my landlords account in cash every month or so. they have no asked me for ID, i just needed to know the account details of the other person
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:18:26
so what happens when the other party to the trade decides they only start the trade to mess with you?
you no longer control your coins right? they need the agreement of both parties to complete the trade. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:44:47
not if you have a big enoguh site for google to not take action.
Several sites and media houses that own different brands all link to each other in a PBN way but I guess when you are a brand its somehow ok.
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:33:01
dont even bother, the likes of this guy are so far down the libertard cult there is no pulling them out

In Canada I prefer to use [paxful.com]( as opposed to local bitcoin for P2P trades as they offer much more payment menthods.
For example I can go to a 7/11 buy a gift card and trade it there for BTC instantly 
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:53:45
"stolen" and good timing too just after india bans bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:21:03
agreed but if you want them to not rank number one we need to give google the signal that they are not relevant for that search.
so high bounce rate and clicking other links for that term should do it over time
