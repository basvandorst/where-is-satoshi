I tried to purchase a hosting plan and domain name but your order form kept giving me the run-around. It would reset and never log the domain name in the buyer's cart and I would always end up with only being able to purchase the hosting plan.

You guys have a tough road ahead. Vault of Satoshi is based in California and ironically can't do business with any users in California because of these extreme regulations.

Being scammed on eBay as a buyer? Haha, those days are long gone. It's the sellers that get scammed now. Buyer protection is 100% foolproof, seller protection is non-existent. 
I've been chargebacked twice after sending buyers bitcoin. A harsh lesson; NEVER SELL BTC ON EBAY.

Sounds like you guys are going for broke. I look forward to trying the site out soon.

The only way i can think of buying btc with cc/paypal is through eBay. Expect HIGH premiums because sellers are putting themselves at risk.

There are still problems with shipping physical goods. The buyer always has the advantage on ebay and can just claim a SNAD dispute and win most of the time, even if delivery confirmation or signature is used. It's just its much easier for a buyer to con a seller with bitcoin.

I could just claim my account was compromised and ebay gives me my money back. Or I could just say the same thing to paypal or I could just chargeback via my cc company. My point is there is NO SAFE WAY TO SELL BTC ON EBAY.
