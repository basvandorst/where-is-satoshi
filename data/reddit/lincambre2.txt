With a decision made to destroy (as opposed to simply discredit), the choices get simple, quickly:
* ["Disappear" major names]( Fear grows, people will avert using it. If this can be arranged among a number of countries [even without their permission]( fear of the engaging with BTC will expand beyond the state(s) behind it. [Some may have thought this out already]( Even accidentallying the three suspects behind the BTC protocol would cause panic. 
* Subvert exchanges. Look at what's happening to BFL and consider how easy it would be to take over a more reliable name and accidentally people's BTCs. Rinse hands and repeat. Or even build up an orderly exchange from scratch, then accidentally it, destroying both the BTC therein, and confidence among other holders. Wisdom may be in not letting any exchange predominate (ie, MtGox could decline to accept new customers until it's less than 5% of the exchange market)
* Hammer cash exchanges. Make it against the law to conduct cash exchanges, then sting people with normal police actions. Wisdom may be in International cash transactions: load up a prepaid card, post it to another country, exchange the PIN and BTC through escrow)
* Hammer wallets. An enormous vulnerability is that changing your wallet password makes no difference to a wallet backed up with a previous password. Spider for online wallets (or even mandatory OS updates), rainbow table them, and empty them. Again confidence is lost. (A massive problem is the disconnect between how ordinary folk think of passwords, and the fact that a previous wallet is still openable with the previous password.)

Change the hash value to 870 (about the workload of a couple decent video cards) and calculate. At the moment, you'll make a bit more than $100 per month
