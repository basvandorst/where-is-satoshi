comparing Bitcoin with TCP/IP is just so wrong. bitcoind is such an incredible mess. everything is broken and all devs love it that way. guess what, that's the reason bitcoin will become obsolete. you don't even know where the utility of advanced features come from. But I guess Mastercoin is a great success, isn't it? building "on top" of bitcoin is a myth. Bitcoin as TCP/IP is a myth. where are all the working examples of advanced applications? nowhere to be found.

Well, yes 100% PoS is vastly superior, which should be obvious to anyone who has worked with it. At this point in time I know of 3-5 people who have a deep understanding of it. The reason is not that there are many possibilities to design such an algorithm. The reason has to do with complexity. 1) All money gets created at genesis. 2) This implies a chain of signatures from known stakeholders. 3) network topology can be leverered (blacklisting). In such a system there is no need to track nodes outside the network - in Bitcoin any computer can create a block. In 100% PoS only stakeholders can produce blocks. A good PoS implementation can be done in 3kLOC, and the amount of cognitive effort is 100x lower than PoW, where most development is wasted on irrelevant or even absurd things. This leads to the right and useful abstractions.
"Mining" wasn't a concept in Bitcoin at all (source: the whitepaper). The PoW concept in relation to digital cash was introduced to solve a certain problem at a certain time (it's really an extension of hashcash in that sense). Anyone who designs a system based on PoW in 2014 does not understand really the purpose in the first place. This obsession with "miners" is amazingly mistaken. Of course we can get rid of miners, and mining has nothing whatsoever to do with "network security".
PoS was designed as an extension to PoW. Ultimately we got a 100% PoS working. But because people have such a herd mentality it takes a long time for the right ideas to get adapted. I predict however that someone will design a system which has a network effect embedded in it (somewhat similar to PoW distribution). That's when it will take off. It will likely not be block-chain based as we know it.

What do you mean by "require more confirmations"? it's a poisson distribution. estimating attacker's hashrate does not make sense to me. that's an unknown. you basically want more than 51% to be honest hashing power. as long as the system is secure (no attack possible) waiting for more confirmations is trivial. I don't see any purpose in the concept of "max safe transaction value". if you transfer say 1M$ you wait 10+ confirms and that's it. the original paper has the calculations. I wouldn't use dogecoin / clones to transfer such values. in that sense I agree: the alt-coins are worthless. their value is speculative in that they could become valuable one day.
an attack as you outlined is way less profitable then you seem to believe. if the attacker dumps his coins he will quickly drive the price down to basically zero. I haven't heard of a profitable attack or double spend, which shows the resilience of such systems even fore low hashing power. otherwise all the coins would have gone by now. the liquidity on the exchanges for the alts is extremely small.
"Thus making an alt-coin for each country/industry is pointless." yes. having any clones at all is pointless. I agree that these country coins don't make sense. the market seems to agree. I think ethereum will be the next big bubble (which it is before it even launched). IPO's like Mastercoin are far more destructive than the clones.

There has been 3 years yours of work by several very dedicated teams, since the idea was introduced in 2011 here: 
It's perhaps 10-20 man years of total work which went into these Cryptocurrencies. So, it's best to look at the evolution of the concept, and read the whitepaper of the top PoS coins - Bitshares DPOS, Nxt, Peercoin.  And then ignore what Bitcoiners say, because they are talking their own book as well (quite a number of core devs recently received 15M$ in Venture funding).
Rank, Name, Marketcap
4 BitShares $ 35,827,113
7 Nxt  	$ 19,848,642 	
8 Peercoin 	$ 17,342,369
 
stats coinmarketcap. The current total value of all PoS coins is 70 million dollars.  
Whitepapers of those 3 coins:
Ultimately users will use what they like and what is helpful for them. For sure it's more risky to buy new coins with unsure security aspects. But there is also more upside. Most upside might come from totally new coin, but it's unlikely that average joe can pick the winner (just like in the stock market). Marketing is a contra-indiactor.

agreed. this might change if shorting coins would be possible on a large scale.  but it seems very unlikely that anyone wants to carry risk for a very risky coin. so if the coin is valuable attack is not possible. if the coin is useless attack is not profitable. so even quite a few junk coins with almost no value can survive. with a true contender to Bitcoin this might change, but then again the principle of value driven mining applies. so the arguments are mostly put forth by people who don't believe in Alts in the first place. the market will sort it out, in my opinion.

thanks for the discussion.
* on the first point, i.e. block reward and necessary hashrate. " if block reward was negligible, double-spending could be a lucrative source of revenue." how are double spends "source of revenue"? if the chain is important enough participants will notice. so either the chain will die or it will live on. this is a rather odd notion to me. do you have any empirical datapoints for these claims? I don't see anything interesting in Rosenfeld's paper. to quote: "we have dispelled some popular myths, such as the absolute security believed to be granted by waiting for 6 confirmations"  huh? bitcoin is secure. otherwise it would not make sense to use it. 
* "They are doomed to have high volatility, shallow markets, low "max safe transaction value"." well, we have a wide distribution of coins and a few of the seem to hold up pretty well. yes, the alt-coins are not secured with a lot of hashing power. but those that are worth enough, are secured. sure doge and the others are fads that are going to vanish. but LTC is a genuine alternative, as you acknowledge.
* on the other approaches, rather than a chain on its own. from these only 3 is interesting in my opinion. 4 is nonsense. if I want to lanuch a coin, why should I hand all that value to another project? and besides Mastercoin, Counterparty, Ethereum are all not in operation and very likely to fail. so if people bring up these projects they must be not very precise in their statements.

A business model of remittance based on Bitcoin: capital costs are extremely high, while revenue is low. The cost of building out booths is massive. Western Union could switch internally to Bitcoin, but that would not make a difference, because they are centralized anyway. To trade Bitcoin for others you need a license. Hence, we have the model of Bitcoin exchanges and Localbitcoins/escrow for P2P. If you know of a different way to convert fiat into BTC, let me know. There are a couple of projects in Africa, i.e., and there are also ATM's. To start such a business is not a home run, necessarily. If you have a good idea and the conviction, then do it!

Yes, decentral database = blockchain. I've invented a two-side auth protocol which works like this using Namecoin. BC among other things can be used to share secrets. But that does not solve the problem of mapping ID's to the real world (anyone can register an used string "Alice"). 
The way it could be made to work is to add services with trust for the initial ID. In Bitcoin if you don't have access to the PK you lose the money. For ID'ing that's not good enough.

Not possible. Anybody involved in such a network would be a criminal by default. There is no such thing as an anonymous, decentralized bank transfer. The closest is an escrow market-place, which already exists (Localbitcoin and others). But then you don't get a match against N anonymous parties via the exchange, but only against 1. Which means your spread is going to be much higher.

Nope, that is not at all how Bitcoin works. In a distributed P2P network, no node has the same memory pool. In a P2P network there no such thing as "choosing the block". Nodes choose to work on blocks they see, and they choose to work on the longest chain, because they assume others do the same, because it is a rational strategy (otherwise they would be burning money). So tree is a meaningless concept. There is only a local mempool, which is different for each node. If you run two Bitcoin nodes in two different places and compare the tx history, you'll see that. And really also the concept of fork is a misnormer in this context. All nodes are all constantly "forking" and converge via the longest chain. There is only one longest chain. If there were several Bitcoin wouldn't work. You can verify what I say by looking into Bitcoin more (which I'm pretty sure Vitalik + Ghost authors never have), and talking to some experts who have practical knowledge (not those producing academic garbage) .

There is no such thing as a tree. Each node has different information arriving at different times. If you'd fire up a P2P network and look at the message flow you'd easily see this by considering the list of incoming transactions and the order the appear in. The challenge is to have a consensus on the order of transactions. As that is impossible some smart guy invented the notion of a block and a chain between those blocks. Blocks are ordered but tx in one block are unordered. Consensus applies to blocks, not a total order of tx. That's how the blockchain works, and from this discussion it's clear ethereum guys do not understand most elementary properties of Bitcoin. What I describe in this post can be verified with quite elementary tools and reasoning.

From a binary string you can't tell what the output is going to be without running the program. That is basically the halting problem. The complexity of Bitcoin's script is of lower complexity than normal programs - it evaluates to a boolean. So the runtime of a script is deterministic.

There is already a lot of innovation that even most Bitcoiners are not aware of: the use of a ledger for DNS and the possibility of replacing the existing public-key infrastructure. That's a very, very big deal, since that's the foundation of the Internet. Basically it means an entirely new class of applications, which today can't be fully recognized. The current generation of these ledgers, Namecoin and others, are not the last word on this. One example: once one has  a better DNS one can make a better search engine.

It's not running live, so those datapoints you're mentioning are completely worthless. Live =&gt; money at stake for attacks. That's pretty basic stuff, so this drivel about PoC is misleading. Once it's live and the tokens have value malicious contracts will bring the network down, if it's even stable with friendly contracts. Also 10-sec blocktime is just idiotic. That means that latency becomes a major issue, and one can gain advantages by selecting peers by proximity.

You say it's flawed so prove it: where is the attack? Or did I forgot the "my handwaving argument works because I say so" rule in logic class? There are plenty of possible attacks on Bitcoin as well. Doesn't mean they are relevant. Poelstra's paper does not explain why PoS networks should not work. It does not describe how an attack would work and why if it does work, why the networks are still operational. The most common objection, the so-called N problem is a complete non-issue.

A search engine per se - no, nobody is doing this yet - Namecoin is a separate coin, with not very convincing design.  is doing some things in terms of ID.
In this conversation between Julian Assange and Eric Schmidt on Bitcoin, JA explains potential of hashing information (like Namecoin): 
On a 10-20 year time-scale it will happen. If one understands how google works + the weaknesses of the current DNS system, one can see the potential of a better DNS. It seems obvious to me that everyone will want a better global name system, where you can own names with crypto, instead via some weird intermediaries (called registrars), who make money only based on database entries (like banks).

If you run any program it's impossible in generality to predict the outcome with another program, i.e. one can't write a program to determine  whether a certain executable is functioning correctly. The inputs for public-key crypto are numbers, not programs. Basically with the blockchain we have a system where we run the program on N computers and then vote on the outcome. But the script is a regular language, not a Turing complete one. I'm pretty sure we are never going to see Turing complete blockchains.

* The testnet is run in one data-center. Basically this demonstrates that they don't know how to test a distributed system. The Bitcoin blockchain is a global system which does not run in one place.
* They claim to have 10 second blocktime. There is a reason why Bitcoin has a 10-minute block-time. There is no evidence to suggest this can work.
* There are like a 1000 things that go wrong. The 15M$ they raised are mostly spent, and nobody knows if this software is even usable (much less usable on a big scale which would warrant a valuation of millions of dollars as a market value).
* The fuel concept really does not make much sense. If somebody runs a contract he has to calculate what resources this requires and the "contract" can run out of gas. There are no demonstrated use-cases, which are not science fiction at this point in time.
* Quite a few people profited handsomely from the ICO, while having contributed little. They've spent 500k$ on lawyers alone.
* The blog post for the launch is very telling. Several different supposed launch versions, mumbling about "auditors" (who are just internal people anyway), and speak of a 2.0 version (proof-of-stake?) etc. is an indication of the disaster to come.

10-second blocktime is really pure idiocy. If the block-time could be that low, bitcoin would have switched to a comparable block-time a long time ago. the better question here is why bitcoin has a 10-minute block-time. there are very good reasons for that. actually to be precise ethereum does not even have "blocks", but "trees". but nobody has any clue what that even means.

There is no reason Bitcoin should be perfect or even the  digital currency. And from a developers perspective there are many reasons it is far from perfection - scaling properties, frozen development cycle, mining centralization. One very good reason to have Alt-Coins is not to give too much power to a few individuals such as Armstrong. Let there be free competition - don't call competition scam.

"The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server."
Quote from the Bitcoin Whitepaper. The blockchain is a timestamp server. How the timestamp is created is explained here. 
"A timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours. "Network-adjusted time" is the median of the timestamps returned by all nodes connected to you."
It's not used for solving the double-spend problem "directly" - the technical term is partial order, see  But potentially it could be, although it's unlikely that Bitcoin will implement such a mechanism. The blockchain builds a consensus on what has happened, but the agreement does not cover a total order of events.

YES. that's a good startup idea. who is in? features:
* modern platform (discourse or written from scratch)
* integrated Bitcoin functionality
* trust ratings
* escrow

Not quite. Bitcoin does use time. Peers check other peers claim about time and check deviations. Here is Satoshi's original comment: 
The Bitcoin blockchain is the most robust timestamp mechanism there ever was. It could be made more accurate if nodes would have accurate clocks (although the utility is very limited at present).
Your correct in the sense that no one nodes time is assumed to be absolute. Indeed this issue is much complex than one might think at first. A timestamp through an approved block is only correct looking back in time. While the likelihood of a reversal of the last say 144 blocks (=one day) is unlikely it is possible. There are many extremely complex issues around this, as soon as one starts to try to implement alternative systems. For example faster block-times have big problems which are related to the issue.

"Nothing-at-stake" =&gt; lame excuse for not thinking. Proven wrong in reality since 2012.
