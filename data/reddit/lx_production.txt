I've done a calculation and found out that if all the money in the world were converted to bitcoin, one bitcoin would be worth roughly 3 million dollars.

I read this already, but sad to say that the translator was unskilled, made it even harder for normal people to understand. I've composed a detail paper on Bitcoin and posted on this [forum]( one of the largest tech forum in Vietnam (but it's in Vietnamese though, you can do a google translate to get the rough idea)
