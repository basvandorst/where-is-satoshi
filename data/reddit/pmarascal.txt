I buy all kinds of crap with Amazon prime. I looked briefly into using purse.io but I don't quite understand it. Should I 100% be taking advantage of this with my everyday prime purchases?

I had one setup on my Pi3 but it's been off for awhile while I think of how to optimize it. Twice the blockchain got messed up and had to reindex, which literally took weeks to get through because both times it failed at the same spot until I deleted half the block and redownloaded from there.
I gave up on that and had been thinking of building a little itx or NUC to run a node and some other home server type things. 
I could never figure out what the heck the bottleneck was, but I'm kind of assuming it was an old external HDD I was using as it's main HD. Maybe I'll get a 256gb flash drive, but the Pi3 doesn't have usb3 speeds right? So at that point I assumed it would be as slow as my external.

Was wondering the same thing. I try to keep up but the last few months I haven't been running my node (trying to upgrade my hardware on my little home NUC) and haven't kept up as much as I did before. I saw the recent dips and was going to buy some more, but looks like I want to wait it out and see some of this fallout first. 
I don't have a hardware wallet, but instead have my BTC split into a few wallets (python wallet based on Core on my Pi3, Mycellium on my phone).  Are these safe to leave be and wait to see what happens, sounds like some of my coins may be split into BTU... In which case I'd have to sell that and buy BTC (if that's what I choose after fallout, etc)?  
But TL'dr - It's 'ok' to just sit in my wallets and wait this out for the time being?

Much smaller scale, but I sold some just above 4K with the intention to buy back double once it 'corrected'... Still waiting, getting antsy!  
Every morning it's like 'oo baby BTC went up again' and then 'crap but that $xxxx I sold last week is sitting in damn fiat right now'.

I'll never understand this. Sure some days I'm into whatever project I'm working on, and sometimes I can talk about it like it's exciting, work with a decent group of people... But wtf in absolutely no way am i actually enjoying my time at work. And I absolutely loathe people that seem to live and talk 'industry' in their spare time. There's about a billion other things I'd rather be doing with my time, that's all it comes down to I guess. 
Do people actually enjoy going to their office job? I really don't understand this unless you're working for yourself or perhaps doing a low pay trade hobby type job. But working in an office for somebody else... Wtf?

Thanks for my weekly reminder to check on antshares price.  I had a stupid moment and bought NEO at it's old peak around $9 and instantly thought it was a pretty dumb move but held anyway, another bump in the road that I learned from... But nice to see it exploded again.

Because money allows me to do the other things I enjoy... And student loans basically kept me chained in. 
I also enjoy my boss, the environment we work in, certain projects... But still overall I'd rather do 100 other things 45 hours a week. But hobby jeep mechanics and my learning woodworking wouldn't have paid off my 50K in student loans over the last 5 years :/

Normally I don't try and play it like this, but I played quite a bit around the lock-in dates and such so I had to be true to what I told myself my plan was. I put quite a bit extra in all at once right around that drop to $2000,  so I wanted to recoup some of that in this current high to make sure I kept to my 'rules'.
But yes absolutely, my majority 'fund' grows slowly and stays away from exchanges.

Thanks - This is really only the 2nd project I've been around in Linux so still slowly learning (aka googling every little thing lol).
iostat showed an 
* avg-cpu w/ 77.58% idle.  
* External HD: 698 tps , 448 kB_read/s  ,   65 kB_write/s
From what I read this is since rebooted, so it's been months and I'm thinking this is normal since it's been synced for most of that. I'm currently reading up on iostat to see if I can get more relevant data.
I ran again for a period of time with -x for extended info and noticed that the disk %util stays up around 85-90%. I see that as it approaches 100% that it's not good, but not sure if this is possibly signalling a bottleneck.

sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/sda (or w/ sda1)

Not 100% sure here when it comes to data speeds and HDDs, but these seem around average read speed (20-30 MB/s) for an older low-range external HD.  Of course, they also seem crazy slow considering how large the blockchain is.

Yea, I may just have to bring the HDD back up to my main PC and power through it quickly when this happens.
But I notice that my CPU usage on the Pi stays around 20-30% while doing the rescan. Not sure if the monitor program on Raspbian OS can be trusted or if it potentially spikes up to full at times when I'm not monitoring.

Buy today if you want coins, investing, etc.
... Mine if you want a hobby that is a fun way to generate some side-cash (or coins)... Completely separate from investment crypto. You're not getting rich from mining, but it's not 'one or the other' like we live in some kind of vacuum.
That being said, idk about Litcoin mining through ASIC mining but you missed the GPU mining boom. Currently estimating around .00025 BTC per day / per 1070 and trending downwards (renting hashing power, getting paid in BTC through @_date: 2017-10-10 14:35:18
I was surprised a few months ago that I had a few different old college buddies text me out of the blue asking about bitcoin, etc.  These are guys I haven't talked to in 2-3 years and haven't seen in like 4-5, gladly pointed them to some sites to read the basics and let them choose their own path.
I've never told anyone to buy because I don't want to be responsible, but I'll sometimes throw a snapchat up of my rig or something of the sort showing I'm into crypto.

Just an honest question - Coinbase/circle seem to be a very easy and fast way for me to buy bitcoin in the US.  Other than that the only other way I know of is localbitcoins and bank transfer seems like the best option there.  But nowhere near as fast and simple as coinbase. Obviously I transfer to my wallet right away, but what really are the best options of buying small amounts of bitcoin for a not-ridiculous fee/hassle? 
Edit: I do understand why circle/CB aren't great but I am just curious as to other better options; my circle account was closed meaning they traced my funds through many different wallets to eventually see some betting sites I used... I definitely don't appreciate the 4-5 different transactions all being traced :/

I just purchased on coinbase, and planned to buy some more each day over the next few days depending on what happens.  
Derp, guess it's gemini or bust for me since these purchases won't complete for 3-5 days which will line up right around when I don't want my coins on CB.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:31:24
Yep, I've been primarily using Gemini ever since I tried it out, although coinbase (and Circle RIP) was easy as a first time buyer a few years back though.
Only hopped back over to CB because my daily limits are much higher there.  Normally Gemini's limits are fine, but with the recent hub-bub I've been doing more than usual.  Guess it's time to do the next validation step to get my limits rasied on Gemini.
