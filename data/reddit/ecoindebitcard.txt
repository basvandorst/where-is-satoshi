The answer kind of depends on what country you are in. I'm obligated to mention the e-coin Bitcoin debit card, though. 
It uses BitGo multisig so your bitcoins can be recovered even if e-coin is hacked, or goes dark.

We agree that the roll out is important. Our website hadn't been updated with the newest fees. If you opened the pdf after whatever html request Zendesk made, you'd have seen that.
Actual users are very aware of our fees because they agree to them from the get go. Again, we apologize that the FAQ was the last place to be updated with the updated fee structure. We're a small team working very hard and we appreciate you pointing out discrepancies on our website. 
This does indeed make remittances much easier. You can send Bitcoin to someone in Armenia and they can spend it like they normally would without giving a huge chunk to Western Union first.
Please try our product before making your final decision. Thanks!

Here's a review of the e-coin.io debit card on a [fintech news website]( 
There are also several e-coin users in this Bitcointalk.org [thread]( that have shared their experiences both good and bad.
As an industry we are aware that Bitcoin debit cards currently have more fees than compared to a bank issued debit card. We're all working to get to the economies of scale going so that fees can be lowered :).
We've been around for awhile but just got around to a marketing push. Here is a recent [interview]( Any other questions, don't hesitate to ask!

Korea has really become one of the most high tech countries in the world - no wonder we see so many e-coin debit cards used in that area of the world!
