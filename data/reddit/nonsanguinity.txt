The answer has more to do with philosophy than law, really.
[Social contract theory]( is a political philosophy, a set of parameters for identifying and legitimizing a system of social organization.  In most cases, the social contract concerns questions related to a nation-state over an individual.
So, the question of whether the state may tax an individual, is, itself a question that is analyzed under social contract theory.  However, whether the social contract theory is an organizing principal for society, is a much deeper question.  
For example, if social contract theory is invalid, nation-states are by and large invalid (unless sustained by some alternative state-compatible theory, such as monarchism, which would legitimize rule by divine right, or communism, that would derive legitimacy as temporary conduit to an ultimately stateless society).  This sort of begs the question, what will replace the state as the source of legitimate authority?  Where do legitimate laws come from and how are they enforced?  Who gets to decide which acts/laws are valid and binding or not?  What happens when parties have a dispute that can't be settled?  What happens when "voluntary" exchanges are entered into under duress?
I hear a lot of people talk about the social contract being invalid, and it makes me wonder if they're really thought through the implications of their statements, which are pretty extensive.

Yeah, it's almost like there's a sort of *social contract* forming the basis of our society that underpins the legitimacy of the rule of law.
