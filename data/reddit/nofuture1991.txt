Normal 32-bit Microsoft Excel can't load the entire file. It stops at 1 million rows.  64-bit version will but is a pain to get it working and breaks compatibility.    In Unix you can use "grep" to accomplish that.  I recommend loading this file into a database.  I ran a search for 08a0a2be-bacb-4573-bcb0-8943c3bf3cab.   I came up with 1582 hits.   That's too big for me to post here.  Use grep or a database search.

yeah, i message theymos and after some thought it seems like the best approach is to work with the block chain and identify cases of TM.   As you said the leak could be tainted.  Anything that comes with wallet-stealing malware should be treated with a grain of salt.   I will say that FWIW we identified a large number of transaction pairs that looked like TM.  But if I understand you correctly Mt. Gox deleted the original withdrawal if a new one was issued due to some kind of error. Theymos said it may have also been the case that issuing new transactions might have been an automated process when the first transaction was not confirmed in the chain.  We are not looking at internal transactions.  We need to search the block chain for cloned transactions and transaction that are not encoded in the standard way for most clients.
