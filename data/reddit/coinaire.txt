To be against insider trading is to be against assymetric information. It is simply another 'all should be equal' law. Speculators with more information actually reduces the volatility in a market.
For instance, let's say that someone knew that bitcoin would be accepted by Walmart in 4 months, which would increase the value of a bitcoin 2 times when it's announced. What would happen? They would be more eager to buy now, at a higher than market price. What would this do? It would reduce the volatility. Therefor, when a the insider is allowed to trade, he reduces volatility.

While you're here, did you build your eCommerce solution from scratch? If no, which did you use?

Yes, but there are too many combinations. You would never be able to find an address that is in use.

If there had been no regulation, there would have been many exchanges in the US. The Mt Gox incident wouldn't have been as huge, if it even would have happened.

If you want to earn money using bitcoin, simply start accepting bitcoin as a payment option for your work. If you trust bitcoin's volatility, simply set up a wallet and let people pay to your address. If you are uncertain about the future value of bitcoin, use BitPay. They enable you to accept bitcoin and automatically sell it for your favorite fiat currency.
You do not need a physical address. You simply download a wallet and generate a private key. No registration, no central overlord - just you and your money.

100,000,000 satoshi is equal to a bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:10:17
That's just wrong.
The proposal is to make one bit being 100 satoshi.

All estimates of how high the bitcoin price could be are, as stated, just estimates. I have seen people talking about everything from 10k dollars to 1 million dollars. These people are probably wrong, if they happen at some point to be right, they were just lucky.


Well, the way we define a bitcoin now is just a social construct, not coded into bitcoin itself. In fact, bitcoins are measured in 'satoshi'. If I remember correctly one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshi. If bitcoin happen to become worth a lot of money, one could easily use satoshi or kilosatoshi as the denomination.

My reasoning is that in two years time we will hopefully have something better. This is more of temporary thing.

With shipping and taxes, the price difference isn't that high.
If you for instance want it shipped to Norway, the total cost is 90 USD (CoolWallet) vs 68 USD (Ledger).
22 USD more for a gadget that doesn't need a secure computer to configure.

You'd have to start your own company.
Check out A couple of ideas:
 * Bitcoin consulting (super easy, just go from business to business and try to make them accept bitcoins for their services. If they want to, but don't have the know-how, offer setting it up for them.)
 * Reselling products (hardware wallets, etc.)
 * Just sell bitcoins locally.  and the Mycelium app on Android.
