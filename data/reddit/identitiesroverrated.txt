Only for large payments. Even then, when neither sender nor recipient hold BTC, that's 2x fiat transfer and 2x conversion fees. A fair amount of work is involved for both parties, and it's both slower and riskier than 1x fiat transfer.
There really is no practicality to BTC unless all involved parties hold it. If you're going to make a fiat payment for every BTC payment, might as well just make fiat payments instead.

Other exchanges might not have been a target of this attack, and/or might employ better developers who implemented systems that monitor transactions properly. Proper transaction monitoring would involve checking whether the out point was spent, not whether it was spent by a transaction with a particular hash.

@_date: 2014-02-10 11:08:09
Not quite. What they claim by implication is that their double spend transactions are a consequence of their system believing that previous transactions, which were processed by a different hash than MtGox initially generated, were not processed. Their system is trying to consume the already spent outputs because it doesn't detect that the transactions were processed, but with a different hash.
This is rather bad news for legitimate MtGox users, because it means MtGox was hacked via its foolhardy implementation of transaction monitoring. If someone did this on a large scale, they most certainly did it in order to leech BTC out of MtGox by convincing it a transaction wasn't processed, which in fact was. This has likely been going on for a while, so who knows how many BTC MtGox has left.
MtGox is blaming this on the Bitcoin protocol, which is sort of partially at fault because it's not stringent enough to prevent transaction malleability. However, it's really MtGox's fault for not taking their job seriously, and using the protocol as it's designed. They would be able to reliably detect transaction success if they checked the blockchain for *any* transaction that spends the outputs they were trying to spend. The fact that they're saying "we will allow withdrawals once Bitcoin is fixed" probably means they lost so many Bitcoins, they can't make customers whole, so they're going to use "Bitcoin is broken" as a delaying tactic.
They are most likely going under as a result of this, since no one will buy Bitcoins at their exchange if they can't actually be withdrawn.
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:16:16
I sure hope so, given the number of my BTC Gox has.
One of the more optimistic explanations is that it wasn't even an attack, but mining software helpfully converting MtGox's non-standard transactions, which were being refused by the network, into valid ones.

Nope. All you need is a large enough laundromat, e.g. something like Satoshi Dice, and you can no longer tell which coins going out correspond to which coins going in. The owner of such a service *could* track that if they keep logs, but if they don't keep logs, the information is not stored in the blockchain.


How's high school?

I'm not blaming others for my losses. You're reading that into what I write, and then going on to defend something you don't need to defend, by writing these unnecessarily harsh replies.
It is a fact that Bitcoin is unforgiving. I do not seek pity for having made decisions that cost me. However, I *am* saying that Bitcoin is too unforgiving to replace fiat currencies.
I see its future role limited to online international payments, and I see most users converting it into fiat currency immediately, to avoid the risks. Mistakes in USD can be undone, mistakes in BTC cannot.

The reference client will let you spend change of unconfirmed transactions, which the currently ongoing malleability attack borks, which then in turn borks the client's ability to reconcile its balances. To fix, you have to resync the blockchain.
That's a bug in the client.

Yes, but if you resort to that last criterion, then even MtGox is fulfilling 100% correctness, assuming they *eventually* fix the withdrawals and make everyone whole. The coins from my failed transactions are back in my account, so I think it's going to work out, but the problem still happened.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:41:09


Oh, I agree, they're not Bitcoin-*specific*. But in traditional money systems, any issues most people might experience with fraud are *reversible*.
I got my AmEx cloned once; someone ran up a $3,500 bill with it in Florida. A few email exchanges later, everything was fixed - for me at least. Walmart probably didn't get their money back; but if they wanted to, they could look for the crook through security footage.
BTC, on the other hand, just gets stolen, and no authority on Earth can return it to you. It's designed that way. And that design, as attractive as it might be, in reality works for bad guys much better than it works for most people.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:38:08


Worse - it was only discovered now, when their system could no longer process transactions, and they had to shut down BTC withdrawals because the failure rate was 85%. This suggests (though does not prove) that most of the BTC they thought they had are gone.

It's my profession to be paranoid about software.

@_date: 2014-02-07 10:00:44
In business - and actually life in general - the perfect tends to be the enemy of the good.
If we were to shut down all infrastructure that doesn't run 100% correctly, we would pretty much be shutting down all infrastructure. If we required 100% correctness for everything, development costs would approach the cost of space exploration (which is one case where almost everything does in fact have to work 100% reliably, or else the entire project is a failure).
By focusing entirely on perfection, we would have much less infrastructure, and less technological progress. (Though the progress we would have would be close to perfect)
That being said, 99.99% correctness is very different from 15% correctness, as is the case here.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:31:35
It doesn't delay transactions at all. It's about duping someone with a poorly programmed system, such as MtGox, to believe they didn't successfully pay you because the exact transaction hash they generated wasn't included in the blockchain - whereas in fact the transaction was processed, only with a different hash.
The transaction went through, but now MtGox believes it didn't, and because they have poor programming and poor supervision, the attacker can withdraw again when the amount is incorrectly refunded to their account.
In other words, MtGox fell victim to a heist, due largely to its own incompetence. There is a way to monitor transactions properly (check if the out points are spent), and it does not require any changes to the protocol.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:14:25


That's why mainly criminals use it (as their main way for paying for things).


In the world of bits, there are no fingerprints. If what you're saying were true, I should be getting my BTC back from whoever stole it - either Karpeles himself, or whoever stole it from him. I would be glad to see that happen, but I'm not counting on it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:22:37
You underestimate my understanding. I weighed the risks of storing it myself, which includes:
losing private keys due to equipment malfunction or disaster;
being hacked;
being robbed by the author of the wallet, or someone who inserted surreptitious code;
against the risks of any of the above happening to one of the largest Bitcoin businesses. I chose the latter until I could figure out a safe way I could trust to store the coins. I was too late.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:53:29
What info do you need? You know which out point you were trying to spend, so check the blockchain and see if it was spent (by any transaction). Lacking a giant cryptographic breakthrough, it could only have been spent to an address you signed - it's just that transactions are malleable, so you can't expect the transaction hash to be what you originally generated.
Frankly, the best defense against this would be to make it default behavior for miners to change transaction hashes before including them in the blockchain - then no one could have the stupid idea of checking transaction success by the transaction hash (since it would always be different than what you generated).
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:05:11

The reason I prefer not to argue further, actually, is your tendency of putting words into my mouth. It just doesn't serve any constructive purpose in a conversation.
It's not that Bitcoin doesn't *solve* the problem of thievery, it's that it makes it *bigger*. Someone who stole coins anonymously, and takes care to submit their transactions anonymously, can't be found. Good luck finding the guy after he's slowly laundered the coins through Satoshi Dice. The money also can't be moved to its rightful owner even while we all see its movements in the blockchain. There's no mechanism for it.
Traditional money systems do have such mechanisms, and it turns out these mechanisms are important.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:35:22


No, I didn't even trade. I planned to get the coins out eventually, but I didn't really trust any method of storing them. I was using that to give me motivation to work on my own Bitcoin implementation, which I felt I'd be able to trust. Bad priorities, in retrospect.

They have no shame left, they're insolvent. It's a desperate delaying tactic.
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:28:34


Well, there's the rub: the coins are in the blockchain, freely visible to all.
If he claims the private keys were lost, he needs to provide a plausible story about how exactly they were stored, and how they were lost. If that's the story he comes up with, then everyone can look at the blockchain for time eternal, and if the coins ever move, we know he lied.
If he claims a hacker copied the private keys, leaving copies of private keys in MtGox control, he must identify transactions in which coins were transferred from those keys to other keys over which he lacks control. The blockchain has to corroborate such claims - we shouldn't be able to find past MtGox/Karpeles transactions using the new keys he claims he doesn't control.
If he claims a hacker took the private keys without leaving MtGox with a copy, this is only really plausible if MtGox stored keys worth $500 million without backups, or if the attacker was an insider. There are a limited number of insiders to search, and for $500 million, plenty of motivation to search them thoroughly.
Finally, if he claims the BTC were stolen via transaction malleability + dumb customer support exploit, he must be able to point to the blockchain, and point out the *exact* transactions in which he claims MtGox sent BTC to people who had already withdrawn it.
Whatever his story is - with this much at stake, he *must* be able to identify the stolen BTC in the blockchain. Then everyone can track them, and if they are ever spent in an identifiable way, the people who stole them can be tracked down.
If he won't identify the stolen BTC in the blockchain, then the assumption has to be he still has them. There's no alternative.

Yeah, that's patently false. Bitcoin is a public ledger.
There are approaches that will minimize people's ability to track your coins - a simple and effective measure is to use a different address for every transaction. But in pursuit of a crime, especially such a large one as this, there are ways to learn addresses, and to an extent, at least, things can be tracked.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:10:14


Given that it happened to such an extent that it resulted in 85% of withdrawals failing, it was almost certainly a heist perpetrated either by a miner, or someone with access to miners, who knew exactly what they were doing, and probably got a lot of coins from Gox this way.

Ah, but you have to use *someone's* bank account to collect fiat currency, and the *someone* who withdraws the money has to have a way of passing it to you. This is how cybercriminals who thought they were safe in their parts of the world were nabbed in the past.
If you instead use the account not to convert to fiat, but to withdraw BTC again, with the intention of anonymizing it, then Bitstamp can link the input with the output, and can provide such information to law enforcement.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:21:43


I agree, it should.


However, the above is not necessarily true - if an error is random and infrequent enough, it can continue to be random and infrequent enough that a system can live with it indefinitely. I'm sure that's what they expected of *this* error, and that's probably *because* it was random and infrequent enough for a long while, until something changed to make it snowball. (Maybe people mining directly to MtGox addresses, combined with their ignoring coinbase maturity for out payments, combined with a run on MtGox when news spread of this problem)

I would assume you have my BTC, and sue you for it.

A savvy court can then decide you have to fork over the BTC, or show beyond reasonable doubt how you lost control over them.

You can stop right there.
My mistake was thinking that someone who is in charge of protecting a million BTC would do a good job of it, and that he's in too public a position to steal it.
This is, obviously, thinking influenced by traditional civilized values, which don't work in anarchy.
It turns out, he's probably going to make use of the anonymous features of Bitcoin to steal the wealth with which he was entrusted. As long as no one can prove that the 850,000 BTC were stolen by him, rather than a hacker, he's going to get away with it. Or maybe they *were* stolen by a hacker; and they are going to get away with it.
This just isn't a system that we can rely on, on any large scale basis. There needs to be more recourse than this. Since there isn't, BTC is a currency that strongly favors crooks (who know what they're doing), and disfavors legitimate users (who make mistakes).
That's not a system most people can use.

You're double counting.
In a credit card abuse scenario, the person who suffers the loss is neither the government, nor the bank, but the merchant. The merchant is in a position to validate the identity of a customer; in the event of credit card abuse, it is this validation that failed.
The real cost of credit card abuse to the merchant is usually lower than the amount on the receipt. In the case of material goods, the cost to the merchant is the cost of those material goods, which is less than their sale value. In the case of credit card abuse over the internet, e.g. where the hacker fraudulently purchases a license or a service, the cost to the merchant is often near zero.
The merchant can well afford to bear these costs because they represent a stable, recurrent, relatively small percentage of its revenue.
In contrast, when Bitcoin is stolen, the damage equals the number of BTC stolen - it isn't less. Furthermore, the party affected is often someone who cannot afford the loss, and can be bankrupted by it. (Not speaking about my case, but there are other stories of BTC theft that did result in bankruptcy.)

This makes me think the only thing about which we disagree is the number of nines.

It's just that pure 100% is not achievable in practice, because there's always something we didn't predict, as [solar-ice explains](

It is a weakness of Bitcoin that transaction validation has many rules which other implementations have to follow *exactly* in order to match the behavior of the network. It is much more difficult to implement a new Bitcoin implementation that isn't the reference client, but is compatible with it, than to implement the reference Bitcoin client in the first place. The reference client doesn't have to be compatible with anything except itself.

knows just enough to be dangerous.
It is difficult to make transaction hashes non-malleable if you're hashing the entire transaction. Not just the script, but the ECDSA signature itself is malleable, since there is more than one way to encode the same signature (and a different re-encoding can be done without access to the private key).
It's possible to create the concept of a non-malleable transaction hash built on the signing hashes actually used to sign the transaction; this would work for transactions that use signatures, but unfortunately, the Bitcoin protocol allows non-standard transactions (and some are in the blockchain) which don't even need to have a signature. These non-standard transactions cannot have a canonical hash derived this way.
Furthermore, a standard transaction that uses specific types of signatures can be composed in such a way that it can be disassembled into pieces which can be reassembled into a different transaction without requiring knowledge of all private keys involved in the original transaction. If the reassembled transaction is processed before the original, it will invalidate the original one and consume some of its inputs. So you can't trust an unconfirmed transaction hash of such a transaction, either - even if it's canonical.
Best thing to do is not put any weight on unconfirmed transaction hashes. A transaction hash means something only when it's in a block.

Hey, another software developer here.
In my experience, 90% of software developers aren't really any good. And by that, I mean they take X times as long to do a job N times as poorly (as someone who is any good). X, N &gt; 3.
In order for MtGox to have a double spend bug for as long as they have, in addition to the coinbase maturity bug, they clearly must not be staffed with stellar talent to begin with. Given that situation, I would have preferred this suspension to happen a while ago.
It's no good to operate a system that produces 85% failed transactions to begin with, it's better to just suspend operations until it's fixed. I wasn't really looking forward to spending most of today trying to withdraw another 73 transactions, with only 11 going through, which is what I was doing yesterday...

If you have free fiat payments, why don't you use them to pay whomever you're paying to?
For most people, trustworthy Bitcoin exchanges are abroad...
Even if you have a local exchange you can trust, that you can pay fiat to and receive it cheaply (a rarity):
* If you're making a small payment, the extra work going the Bitcoin route isn't worth the hassle of saving 2-4% on credit card fees (Brazil 7% is an exception, and if you want to compare to that, you have to compare to other options available *in Brazil*), never mind the loss of consumer protection (cash payment is great primarily for the merchant - as a consumer, chargeback is a nice option).
* If you're making a large payment, international wire transfer fees are $50 - $100, depending on the bank and currency (transfers within EU much less). Saving that amount may or may not be worth the hassle to you. For someone who's likely to make a large international wire transfer, I think it is not - I know it isn't for me.
It really quite misses the point to talk about saving a few % in transfer fees when USD/BTC was 500 yesterday, and is 450 today.

The ongoing malleability "attack" might be called a DoS, but probably not DDoS. The extra D stands for Distributed, and implies flooding a target with junk traffic from many hosts, so it can't process legitimate traffic. That's not what's going on.
The DoS attack (if you call it that - I would rather characterize it as helpful and urgent pressure to fix the problem) started happening *after* the MtGox announcement, not before. What MtGox was subject to before was either a smaller scale attack that targeted their transactions specifically, or an accident which happened to affect their transactions because of the way they encoded them.

I was able to find my missing transactions in MtGox's feed, and from a cursory investigation, it seems like the sky might not yet be falling. (I.e., the cause might not be MtGox's insolvency, but rather incompetence, which means we might eventually see our Bitcoins.)
It turns out that one of the outputs that MtGox tried to use to produce my transaction was a recently generated coinbase output which is not yet 100 blocks old - not even at this point, let alone hours earlier, when MtGox tried to spend it. Apparently, people are mining to MtGox addresses associated with their accounts, and MtGox tries to spend them after a handful of confirmations rather than 100, which coinbase outputs require.
There might be problems with other previous outputs, but this would definitely cause a transaction to stall.
I'm somewhat confident right now that this is a big technical snafu based on old bugs that MtGox hasn't bothered fixing in a while (such as the known coinbase bug and the known duplicate spend bug), but which snowballed now that many people have panicked (like I have) and tried to withdraw.
Hopefully, I'm right about this, and we'll eventually see our Bitcoins.
It's still gross incompetence and unimaginable customer service, of course.

Indeed, that's the most jaw-dropping aspect of it. Given the lack of any credible details, which they haven't provided, about how the coins were "lost", the most sensible hypothesis appears to be that Karpeles wants to get away with it. He's behaving as though he's counting on that the legal system will not suspect him, and will lack the technical competence to see through bogus claims about how the BTC were stolen by an anonymous hacker.
How he expects to do this without a seriously shortened life expectancy is beyond me. What does he plan after the court proceedings, to disappear? Suppose Bitcoin grows further - does he really think he won't be found, as thousands of people he defrauded get increasingly more interested in finding him? If he manages to stay hidden, what does he think his quality of life is going to be?

I hope so, many of my BTC are at stake. I was only able to withdraw about 12.5% of what I had in MtGox before they closed withdrawals... by the end, the transaction failure rate was 85% (11 of my 73 transactions succeeded).
Fortunately, Gox credited the failed transactions back to my account, but that's worth nothing if they don't have any coins left.

Frankly, I don't see a major difference between Bitstamp's statement and MtGox's statement. MtGox's statement appeared arrogant, but it came first, and it came with a bold assertion that the network has a problem, which no one believed due to MtGox's history.
Then it turns out, the network actually does have a problem. Still not in the protocol itself, but in most widely used software, *including* the reference client. We accused MtGox of incompetence - still maybe justifiably so, because given their role, their software should be better. But then it turns out developers of the reference client committed some of the same mistakes, since their implementation is *not* completely invulnerable to the issue.
MtGox would appear to be vindicated - the reference client does have to be fixed. It's hard to point fingers now.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:06:06
The protocol is inferred from the reference client, but that doesn't mean it *equals* the reference client. There *should* be a well-written specification that everyone is asked to adhere to, but in the absence of that specification, the protocol still does not equal the reference client. The protocol just isn't written down, yet. It's *still* independent of implementation.
You can't just say protocol == reference client, because the reference client contains all sorts of shit that another implementation doesn't need to have in order to be fully compatible with the reference client.
When the reference client has a bug that another implementation could easily not have, while still being compatible with the network, that's not a bug in the protocol, it's a bug in the reference client.

Bitstamp wasn't targeted, MtGox was. If it was a hack, otherwise replace "targeted" with "exposed to the problem".
That's like saying Apple products are immune to viruses. They're not, they're just a smaller target than Windows.

I see no physical part of Trezor that can't be made for cheap. If it's expensive for now, it's only because quantity is low and it hasn't entered mass production yet, so the fixed overhead costs dominate.

If the credit card company took the hit, they would have probably long since migrated to a more secure system. :-)

Ah, so then you're incurring the fees of paying fiat to an exchange (which one do you trust?), as well as the fees of conversion. Practical and cheap! */s*

Since they resumed withdrawals, but apparently without fixing any of the issues causing transactions to fail, I attempted another 34 transactions.
Of those, 6 went through. The other 28 are stalled.
That's about an... 82% failure rate. :/

Bitcoin doesn't take away the risk of third parties either, unless you write your own Bitcoin software (which is even more problematic). They are just third parties you can't sue if something goes wrong.

It is commonly mentioned that MtGox originally stood for "Magic The Gathering Online Exchange". It's an amateurishly built site that went big as a fluke, because it happened to be in the right place at the right time. Maybe it will survive to fight another day, and improve eventually (probably after management has changed).
Bitcoin in general suffers from this because of how fast it has developed, and the legal limbo in which it is. BFL is another similar case - an obscure niche company that can't handle the spotlight of success.
We might have a more professional community in time, eventually. Among other things, if/when the uncertainties about the legal status of Bitcoin are resolved, and seriously minded business people are assured it's not going away.

So you're saying one would have two accounts at the exchange - one with a fake name, and one with one's real name. The fake account provides the stolen BTC. These must now be transferred to the real name account in some way that doesn't imply a connection between the two accounts (i.e. not a direct transfer).
How does that happen?

The difference is that honest wealth doesn't need to move all that much.
After losing 221 BTC on MtGox, I think I'm now a fan of the traditional banking system.

Yes they did. Complaints of failed transactions containing duplicate spends have been popping up on forums for months. MtGox implemented a system which refunded the account if the transaction hash wasn't processed within 6-7 days. It appears likely that this system was automatic and operated on autopilot for at least a period of months.
If there was customer support involved, chances are they didn't understand what was happening even as it was happening right in front of them, otherwise they would have fixed this a long time ago.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:54:49


No, I didn't trust the authors of such a wallet. I was forced into this after MtGox started going down - I did install a wallet then, and was able to extract a fraction of my coins.
Before this, I figured that if it turns out that the wallet is backdoored, I will have less of a relationship with wallet authors than I have with MtGox, and therefore less of a claim than if Karpeles steals the money. (That could still be true. The wallet could still turn out to be backdoored, and Karpeles *might* - heh heh - return the money.)
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:53:15


That simpler explanation is contradictory to MtGox holding 500k BTC. If they do hold the BTC, as this topic suggests, they must not have access to them. Plausible reasons are lost keys, or government coercion. Can't really think of anything else.

I'm not sure he was doing what he liked. The company appears to have grown into something he could hardly manage. MtGox had substantial problems with the US government which went as far as freezing accounts / confiscating assets. As a result of these troubles, and possibly due to other issues as well, MtGox lacked liquidity to let users to withdraw fiat currency. Day after day, he had to deal with angry customers and lie to them so there wouldn't be a run on the exchange, which would collapse it. For a year or more, this continued.
I can imagine this to be tremendous stress for a person who originally only planned to run a small, somewhat amateurish business. But he comes up with an idea that he thinks could rid him of all this stress, *and* keep most of the BTC belonging to his customers. Pretend they were stolen!
He might have stumbled over the known (and old) transaction malleability problem, and figured, "Hey, why don't I help myself to some fake accounts, and use them to siphon off all this BTC from MtGox. When I've siphoned off most of them, things will start breaking at MtGox, and I will officially notice the problem. Then I can blame it on anonymous hackers, support my public image as someone who is incompetent, bankrupt the company, and I'm free and clear."
The man can implement his own Bitcoin wallet, that much we know. He's *not* incompetent.
He extracts probably more than MtGox could profit over a long time with trading; more than he could have sold the company for. He gets rid of all the stress and trouble. Additionally, the BTC he has stolen might appreciate in 10 years by 10 times or more. Perfect plan, no?

1/250th of a currency is a huge amount.

I'm sorry, but I have difficulties providing a longer reply because I don't know what misunderstanding leads you to think (1) this change might lead to a scarcity of BTC, and that (2) in a scarcity of BTC, its price might plummet.
This proposal would preserve the amount of new BTC generated per day, and it would not affect the number of BTC in circulation. If there was in fact a scarcity of BTC, its price would rise, rather than plummet.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:20:38
Yep - agreed on all counts.

He did in fact do a lot of research. Sometimes, practical experience teaches you things research didn't.
I would say even that this is usually the case, as a matter of fact.

Your assumption is that miners representing most of the network's computing power use the same or similar criteria, with no altered logic. Is there any evidence for that assumption?
If I was a miner, I'd take an inventory of all transactions, sort them in descending order by transaction fee per byte consumed, and cut the lowest-yielding transactions that don't fit. (I'd also cut all zero-fee transactions, since no one is paying me to include them, and I wouldn't want to encourage that.)
I wouldn't have a "less than standard fee" cutoff, that's just silly - as a miner, that means leaving money on the table for the next person to pick up.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:16:23


The entire point of this proposal is that orphan blocks are made useful, so there's no need to make this compromise.


That does appear to be its most significant flaw. However, if Bitcoin could process much larger numbers of transactions, and provide confirmations must faster, that would be a major and compelling improvement that would help make it more attractive in many real world situations.
Also, by "everyone", what you really mean is validating super-nodes, which will be able to afford both the disk space and the bandwidth. Long term, if Bitcoin grows, it's not going to be feasible for "everyone" to store the entire block chain, with this proposal or not.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:25:42
It's not a problem if they sell it slow. Still a huge portion of currency, though.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:20:22


I don't think you even understand Bitcoin.
What transactions a miner chooses to include in a block is entirely up to the miner, it's not specified by protocol or enforced by the network.


Of course it doesn't have a need for a "standard fee", that's why people are complaining to have it removed.

She doesn't know how to reasonably express her doubt, but that doesn't mean it isn't valid. There's a significant chance that the price of Bitcoin can collapse, probably higher than the chance that EUR or USD will collapse.

It is considered an asset, but not a financial instrument.


Yes. It's considered a movable asset, rather than a fixed asset. There's no capital gains tax on movable assets, with some exceptions which do not include Bitcoin.

With about $400k, you can get citizenship on an island in the Caribbean. I know a person who did that, and then renounced his US citizenship.
Last I checked, he regretted the decision. It's a way to no longer have to answer directly to the US authorities, sure. But the drop in the standard of living is just extreme.
