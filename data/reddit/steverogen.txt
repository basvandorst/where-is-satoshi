Hey Jvanbec,

Thanks for the interaction.

Hi igadjeed,
Thank you for your comment. 
This article would be for those less informed as yourself. 
Not necessarily irrelevant. However, we do mention in the article that Clear made that same statement. 
Have a good rest of the week,
The DinarDirham team.

Hey Dsrtfsh,
That's awesome! Would love to know how it goes for you :) See if you can meet with Arai, I'm sure he'd love to meet you.
Have a great time!

Potentially :D Good point. We just finished a blog recently on Bitcoin price predictions, and cover both sides of the isle. You can view that here if you would like:

Thank you for your insight :) I hope the article is still insightful.
Have a wonderful day,

It's possible. In the article I linked in the comment reply above however, some of these guys are giving reasons why they believe it'll go there and even above. That said, others give their reasons for why they think it looks like a Bubble.

Thank you :) 
We thought it was interesting news nonetheless.

Hello PixelPhobiac,
We haven't even given our initial release yet. Have you read our other sources on the company or the DNC? I'm sorry for your negative view. You can read this article to help clear some confusion and see our upcoming products, including the DNC:

Oh, which event were you at? Might I ask what those red flags are? Just past experience with gold-backed digital currencies of the past? 
Well our ICO is in 2017, and you're more then welcome to do whatever you wish with your coins.

We only post our own articles once a weak. All other posts are from other sites, and no, we're not paid by newsbtc to post their article. If you took any time to look at our history, you'd see there's a mix of positive and negative stories, in no certain order.

I was surprised as well. Nearly at least:

I wouldn't say totally "incorruptable", but I see your point. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:50:19
What do you think happens in the latter two stages? :D 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:33:19
Let us hope not... if it is indeed a Bubble... which it may or may not be. Best advise - never invest an amount of cash that you're not willing to lose, but be willing to invest some at least in the possibility of continued rise. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:44:13
New articles usually don't show up straight Monday morning from what I've seen :) 
And is it any less important? 
Enjoy the rest of your week. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:41:50
Thank you for that. Ok, I understand the concept, but that's exactly what a debit card is essentially, right? A credit card is on credit - borrowed money. A debit card, however, draws directly from your existing funds, and I think you can even put limits on them. That's my understanding at least. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:23:43
For donning the name "Yoda", you seem to be a bit on edge :D Might I ask, how is a plastic debit card putting someone in debt? A credit card uses debt, however a debit card simply pulls from your existing funds (in this case BTC), and perhaps charges a small transaction fee.  And since Visa hardware are so widely adopted and already in use, it is opening the door to BTC being accepted and used. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:39:16
True... but then again, we could say that for fiat as well. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:14:00
Good. Well, I would say go directly to the source, there are a ton of websites who love taking things out of context, filtering information, not giving accurate descriptions, character assassination, lying, etc. Go directly to the source, listen and research the resources they themselves cite. Much of the time, "they" are defined. Lots of breaking stories that come out later in other news sources. There are also a lot of very strange things happening outside of the public sphere that most people don't see, don't see it, can't possibly be happening, right? I'm not saying everything he says is accurate, but I would suggest watching them from their own channel, unfiltered, watching their normal news coverage, baring through some of the crazy rants Alex has sometimes, and looking into their sources - they do have a variety of other researchers, spokesmen, and top of the line guests as well. I think you'll find he's/the network are not as crazy as people try to make him out to be, they have constantly lied about him and tried to assassinate his character, taking things out of context, editing out important info to make it seem like he's said something which he didn't, etc. If you want to see fake news, look at what mainstream media has spewed out time after time after time after time again, pretty easy to find, recorded, and outright ridiculous what's coming through "trusted" news sources. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:56:23
I would highly disagree with your statement. Besides the fact that this video isn't even Alex doing the commentary (he does a short thing in the front, but isn't part of the main video). And why attack the producers of the video before (I assume) even watching it, and looking at what they have to say, then looking into it yourself?

Hello SaikoPlusOfficial,
Thank you for the recommendation. Hopefully someone will find it useful on this thread :) Can't recommend it as I haven't used it before. But thank you. 
Have a great day!

Based on the chart, and the history, I'd say upwards. But don't quote me on that ;) 
Good question indeed. 
Thank you,
