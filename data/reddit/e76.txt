Why would brick and mortar companies be the next wave of businesses to adopt Bitcoin? B and M companies are notorious for not adopting new technology. I cannot think of a single reason to support this speculation.
@_date: 2014-07-16 02:44:49
Exactly. This is crucial because of things like clock drift or even sillier, an incorrectly set local time ;)
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:04:21
Wait, what?
If you read the document in question, if you even look at the screenshot of it in the article, it says it only works if:
- The device is in physical possession (it's a "local exploit")
- Is a specific version of said device
- This exploit ever even gets fully crafted. It's currently still in development, and my educated guess would be all they have is a proof of concept and no actual exploit to deploy.
But fear is more exciting :-) So there's that.

Mods can't moderate Bitcoin! Duh. /s
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:59:50
And how long has it been in beta?
It's new for consumers. It's just hitting a tipping point, a critical mass... I'd consider it pretty brand new for people like the OP.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:30:42
I'll give it a go!
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:24:48
This would not mitigate the problem. People who are strongly manipulating the market have enough capital to take a hit of transaction fees from groups of 0.1 BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:37:37
Of course just as I post this, BTC-E suddenly reflects MtGox. What gives?
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:32:35
I can guarantee it's fake. The fact that you need to select which browser you're using to view the page with makes it so obvious that it's just modifying the page/serving a fake version.

@_date: 2013-04-10 16:47:52
It's still brand new. Forbes just called Bitcoin a "disruptive technology", which I think is a good way to put it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:26:19
Here's my advice. **No, you should not worry.** This happens with penny stocks too-- a very high fluctuation of prices until a "correction" is made. With Bitcoin, small corrections have already happened (one seems to be happening right now as it falls ~$20), at which the current asking price for a Bitcoin is more aligned with its true perceived value.
This is part of the mental "game" that trading has. It's easy to see the valuation of something rise and fall and get very excited or upset. What some people don't realize is that there are other forces at play besides simple supply and demand. If there weren't, corrections wouldn't be made-- the market would be "perfect". One thing you might want to do is figure out when these corrections are going to happen and either short them (can you do this with Bitcoin? I'm not sure) or buy after they happen to get a more realistic quote.
**Source:** Research, a bit of experience with trading (including a small amount of BTC), and talking to family members who do trading for a living. This is not financial advice, however, and I am in no way responsible for any losses you may take.

Judging by their FAQs, it seems like you'll need to be verified if you want to decrease your withdrawal/deposit limits. I just verified this myself-- there's nothing stopping you from adding funds to your account and trading before you get verified.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:48:52
Some people really do speculate too much. It's back up...
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:33:16
I like this idea of people "testing" the price. We've seen this happen several times now, especially on Mondays after there's a rush to buy Bitcoin. Market prices always seem to come down as they're corrected.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:52:00
I could be wrong about this, but my understanding from studying more 'traditional' markets is that if a market isn't regulated, there's nothing stopping anybody from manipulating the market (ie; raising the price by making a huge buy, then selling once the price has gone up). One of the behaviors of a heavily unregulated and manipulated market is sudden and sharp raises and drops in valuation. So yeah, with that in mind I don't think it will ever be stable. Perhaps someone with more knowledge on this matter could weigh in?

Aside from the issues mentioned already about "taintedness", it's extremely easy to mix your bitcoins, sometimes referred to as a "laundry service".There are several services that offer to do it for a nominal fee.

I know, I'm really sorry. Is there something I can do to make it up to you?
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:21:48
People deserve to get burned if they're making uneducated and unaware investments. However, I'm not as pessimistic as you are. If Bitcoin ever gets massive adoption, easier, safer wallet management will be a ripe business opportunity.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:38:57
This is most likely it. Speculation beyond that is silly right now, IMO.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:10:41
This is typical after a big piece of infrastructure (ie; database) fails. Things lag behind a bit as network services are restarted, etc. I'd stay calm and expect your deposit to go through soon.

Except communication gets routed between nodes, no? And they all speak the same language (protocol). Couldn't I just ask the list of nodes my node has discovered who is apart of A and who is apart of B, and route accordingly?

I am seriously doubting the legitimacy of this. You cannot "send" AP press releases if you aren't the AP. That with all the typos makes me not believe a word of it.
I would not be surprised if an unrelated DDoS attack took place, however, and those who have seen this panic more than usual. Now that sounds a lot more likely to me, and a bit of a cleaver ploy at best.

Personally, they don't strike me as a scam and more of a very poorly managed business. I have a feeling you'll get what you paid for, but it's either going to be subpar or extremely late, or both. I don't mean to sound negative-- just been my experience in dealing with companies like Butterfly Labs.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:45:01
Actually there's an entire field of computer science devoted to consensus algorithms, which hugely predates Bitcoin or its Blockchain. Bitcoin is insanely cool, but I don't believe this to be factually accurate.

This isn't exactly true! Hopefully this will calm everybody's nerves a little.
Google is very, very good at following links. You'll notice that there's only a handful of results for "site: Google has to have picked those up from sites linking to Coinbase checkout pages. **Only a small number of merchant details have been "leaked"**-- Google has simply cached these merchant pages because someone (ie; the merchant themselves) have linked to it on another page Google has crawlwed.
I agree it'd probably be a good policy for Coinbase to make sure these pages aren't cached. It looks like Coinbase now has a robots.txt file, which will hopefully cause Google to forgot about those pages the next time it crawls Coinbase.com:
    # See  for documentation on how to use the robots.txt file
    #
    User-Agent: *
    Disallow: /checkouts/
    Disallow: /buttons/

Looks like its creating a window to show later in the source code. I wonder ifs a fake wallet password window to try to get the user to ender their wallet password? This could be how it was stolen. Haven't looked enough into it to know for sure.

Profiting from arbitrage is definitely possible-- there's literally nothing stopping you from doing it. However, there's a substantial amount of risk. First off, subtract any fees that you'll be paying from the difference. Secondly, If a market correction occurs or a heavy fluctuation takes place, the difference may not be there by the time you have an opportunity to sell. Most of the solutions that exist for buying Bitcoins require a waiting period of anywhere from several hours to several days.
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:15:18

Not use your service, for starters. If I were really passionate about starting my own exchange, I'd do it the right way and hire a kick ass team of talented engineers to do it. I would not use a white label solution.
Perhaps I'm wrong and this is a service other people want... But after hearing about this, I can't help but wonder "why?"
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:22:22

I don't follow. Instead of calling everybody an idiot who uses a mixing service, could you please elaborate on why this is so? Maybe I'm mistaken, and I'd like to know if that's so!
My understanding is that mixing does not happen on the blockchain. Most good mixing services will create a new address and disperse small, randomized amounts of BTC to one or several new addresses you own. A mixing service for the truly paranoid would create new addresses for both receiving and sendings ends.
So that's:
    "dirty" client address --- (btc send) --&gt; mixing address --&gt; ???
    
    ??? --- (btc send) --&gt; "clean" client address
    ??? --- (btc send) --&gt; "clean" client address
    ??? --- (btc send) --&gt; "clean" client address
    ??? --- (btc send) --&gt; "clean" client address
The whole point is that mixing creates a blind area in the blockchain where history is lost.
