Why not just use a paper wallet?

Wrong subreddit. Which you already knew. But you posted anyway.

I guess I'll consider spending my money at Grubhub in 3-6 months then.
Too bad they aren't interested in "experimenting" with bitcoin now.

Care to elaborate on this? How are they different? I might be mistaken, but I thought they were the same thing.
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:17:45
For cold storage, I don't see any advantages that electronic devices have over paper wallets. 
Paper wallets are not hackable, they will last forever, and they are cheaper than any phone/tablet/USB drive.
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:00:47
How much would that be in bytes?

There are potential legal consequences for encouraging suicidal people to kill themselves. You should be more careful about what you say.

Don't they use internet explorer there?

Why do you think that?

Also, a weak dollar means a strong bitcoin.

Sounds like you're blaming others for your own mistakes.
It seems like they are trying to help you.

Ah thank you... micro... suddenly it makes so much more sense!
@_date: 2014-07-10 21:06:03
I'd rather use bytes.

When you say shovel, do you mean hammer?

Easy as going to bitaddress.org and clicking on the generate wallet button.

It's easy. Research paper wallets.

Sure ya are, Blackjak666

Well if words can have the same meaning, then let's go ahead and call millibits bits too. That way everything is bits and no one will be confused.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:16:39
That depends on the type of bread.
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:11:45
That's really confusing.
How much is a bit in standard units?
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:58:07
Bits are to bitcoin as cotton is to dollar bills.
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:42:50
Using SI prefixes makes way more sense to me than coming up with arbitrary names for the different quantities/order of magnitude.
I already know SI units, because it's standard, for distance, weight, time, etc. It makes it very easy to know a quantity without having to memorize 10-20 different prefixes for each different thing being measured.
Plus, a "bit" is already a unit of measurement for data.
I guess, to each their own, you can use whatever words you want. But personally I don't have the patience to learn 20 new words for different orders of magnitude of btc. Especially when we already have a system that works really well.
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:32:28
As easy as scanning a QR code.
I would not sleep well knowing I had large amounts of bitcoin kept on an electronic device that could fail at any time. Electronics degrade. How long does a tablet HD last, even if you never use it? Will it still work in 10 years? Probably, but I really don't know... But paper doesn't decay in quite the same way that electronics do, where one day it works and the next it just doesn't turn on.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:56:35
XBT doesn't even sound like bitcoin. That's just stupid.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:33:03
Are you just making this up as you go along?
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:07:41
Paper seems far more reliable than any kind of electronic device. Just print a few extra copies, laminate them, and store them carefully.
@_date: 2014-05-31 05:14:14
Use paragraphs, you weirdo.
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:41:10
A bit is a unit of data.
8 bits makes 1 byte.
A bitcoin is a unit of digital currency.
Mixing the language for these two things is stupid, unnecessary, and will confuse people.
We already have a really great system for quantifying numbers called metric prefixes.
Microbit = .000001 bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:45:40
I call bits Ralphies 'cause it sounds better.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:52:03
@_date: 2014-06-21 01:33:24
We already do. It's called a ralphy.
@_date: 2014-01-16 06:45:58
Why not just use a paper wallet?
@_date: 2014-08-08 20:58:42
What you are interested in is not really your choice.
If you are curious, look into it.
If you find it interesting, then cool.
If not, then look for something else you might be into.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:58:49
I hope they also add in bits and ralphies for unit designations.
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:52:09
We're going to leapfrop bits and go straigh to ralphies.
@_date: 2014-05-31 05:21:19
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:17:44
We're using ralphies now.

I could help you with gas, if you tip me a little first. I need some bitcoin in order to buy a fresh layer of paint on my yacht.

If you trust coinbase more than you trust yourself, then sure, keep your coins on coinbase. But if anything happens to coinbase, then you will be shit out of luck.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:57:17
Well, I won't be using bits because bits already has another meaning, that has been in use for 30+ years. 
I'll be using microbits. Just like I use meters instead of hogsheads.
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:28:51
I'm going to assume you mean homonym as defined as I'm right and you're wrong.
Yes, I agree.
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:52:58
That's why when I say yes I mean no, and when I say stop I mean go.
For some reason people are always doing the opposite of what I want them to.
How many bits are in a bit?
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:31:04
What I don't get is why we haven't starting using ralphies yet. Come on people, it's not that hard. Ralphies is the new term for 10 bits. Officially starting now. Who wants some ralphies?
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:15:19
But what do you call 1 bit using SI units?
[Here's a list of the SI prefixes if you want a hint.] (
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:11:39
How much is that in standard units?
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:10:02
You can't really spend bits either, because "bit" is the word used to quantify data.
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:34:51
You're not going to be very successful digging holes with a hammer.
You should use a tractor instead. And when I say tractor, guess what I mean?
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:39:11
No, don't delete anything, just send your bitcoin to your paper wallet address. You'll be moving bitcoin from one place to another, like a cut/paste, not a copy.
Only move small amounts at first if you don't know what you're doing.
@_date: 2014-07-27 14:19:56
I think bits are cool. It's easy to remember and rolls off the tongue easier.
I would also like to propose that we start to use Ralphies for units of 8 Bits. This would help the confusion about bits and bytes, because 8 bytes makes a bit, and 8 bits makes a Ralphy. Makes way more sense.
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:35:16
Large amounts of bitcoin should be stored in paper wallets. Any electronic device can fail at any time. Especially newer electronics like tablets... it's impossible to know the average life expectancy because even the oldest ones are only a few years old. But at some point, all electronic devices fail.
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:58:25
You're lucky. I only have 1 gold bar :(

Wait, what? I don't understand.

Maybe you should crosspost this to It's about as relevant there as it is here.

When will you idiots get tired of posting this same crap over and over again?
It's never going to happen. Only stupid people use bits.

I'd start out more like an apple dealer, and less like a store that sells apples.
Find someone who likes apples, give them some for free, offer to sell them some if they like, and tell them to call you when they want more.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:21:17
Wow, that's really confusing. I guess we are going to need to come up with a new standard for measuring data, now that "bit" is a unit of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:23:34
That's true.
And by true I mean not true.
Have you ever heard of a megabyte?
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:58:34
Hammers and shovels are somewhat related. They're both used to build things. Both used in construction.
Bits and bitcoins are somewhat related. They're both computery digital quantities of things.
I'd be less annoyed if "hammer" was used to describe a microbitcoin. It would be far less confusing than using "bit".
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:37:26
Let it be known: henceforth, 8 bits shall be referred to as 1 ralphy.
It is now done. May your bits and ralphies bring you great happiness.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:46:19
Hmm interesting. Don't we already have a well established standard naming scheme for this kind of stuff? Like... metric prefixes?
Isn't a millionth widely recognized as "micro-"? So wouldn't it make a lot more sense just to call it a microbitcoin? Instead of coming up with new words for each order of magnitude, or words that already have a specific meaning? Like "bit"? 
Seems like the whole "bit" as a unit thing is really not very well thought out.
@_date: 2014-01-16 06:58:08
You can print backups and laminate them. Stash them. Bury them. Put them in fireproof safes.
Anything electronic can and will break eventually, it's just a matter of time until it one day it just doesn't turn on. Although I suppose with mycelium you would have a paper backup anyway.
Personally I think paper wallets would be safer, but ultimately, your bitcoins, your choice.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:35:12
The point is, we already use bits to describe a quantity of data.
It's like if we renamed hammers to shovels.
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:19:02
Maybe you should tell your bank not to send them any more money.
@_date: 2016-03-22 16:52:33


I don't see how that would be sketchy. It's not unusual for people move money like that. Are you worried about your bank or coinbase?
@_date: 2019-03-06 16:01:34
You just need to use context.
@_date: 2019-03-06 16:18:06
That's never going to catch on. You can certainly use it if you like, just like you can call ounces degrees, but it's confusing and makes you sound silly.
I recommend you look up the metric system.
@_date: 2019-03-06 16:38:15
Normies prefer metric.
@_date: 2019-03-06 15:40:13
Aka 31.25 bytes
@_date: 2019-03-06 15:36:46
A bit is already a unit of measure in computer science, as in bits and bytes. 
It would be like trying calling a cubic centimeter a foot. It makes no sense because a foot is already a unit of measure. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 17:31:17
Just buy a little if you are interested in it.
@_date: 2019-03-06 15:48:35
Well in that case I propose we call satoshis liters. That wouldn't be confusing at all.
We already have a system for this called the metric system.

The lesson to learn here is that you should never trade, ever again. It turns out all those people who said "don't trade" were right. Focus on getting a job, or getting to a place where you can get a job. 5k isn't much. Lesson learned.
