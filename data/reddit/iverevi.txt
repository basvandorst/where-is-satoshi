Not necessarily. It depends on the country, not the language.

What if you gift someone bitcoin?

His demeanor is so odd. He claims he lost 400 million dollars worth of bitcoins and he acts like nothing is really wrong. Either there is more to the story or he is a textbook psychopath.

Wow. This video demonstrates why Bitcoin is not yet ready for the masses.

Did you follow a particular guide that you recommend?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:23:41
Thanks for this. So, create truly random wallet. Encrypt the key with BIP38. Use a decent password and keep the file safe. Done. Correct?

Could you elaborate on that for the newbs? (not for me of course).  :-)

This brain wallet business makes me sad. What if you died tomorrow? Your heirs will get none of your bitcoins and they will be gone forever.

Why is Satoshi anonymous anyway? Why wouldn't someone claim credit for the brilliant idea?

Which is more likely: dealing 100 consecutive royal flushes or creating a bitcoin public/private key pair that someone already has?

These are the "better graphics" ??  :)
Lots of fun. Looking forward to this getting even better.

This is fascinating. How does one start to get bitcoins? Explain it to me like I'm 4.

If he makes them in advance with keys he generates, that is a huge security risk. He should never know or have access to the private key. Buyers should send him their public key to have them made on demand.

How many consecutive royal flushes would it take to be similar odds?

Yes, it ends with sex. :)
