Oh fuck, I need to start buying.

Uuuh. I don't know about brilliant. More like, *evil*.

Even if you're into buying cars you normally don't consider a new one until at least 100,000 miles.

The presidential polls are BS too, so...

It's called working. Bitcoin isn't going to let you live the NEET life for another 10 years, go get a job.

Great to know I can tag you as *racist towards whites* on RES.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:25:48
Don't sell and you're good.

Hodling at the dips takes this power away.

I hope it drops more. I've got new job money to spend and would love discounted bitcoin.

Yeah I'd rather view Coinbase Pro in a mobile web page than use the Coinbase app.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:37:58
Same. Gimme gimme.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:06:05
Oh I'm buying

Bitcoin is not a deflationary currency. There is far more going on with its value that the halving every couple of years.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:52:31


I don't think so. Bitcoin has more people using it now than ever before. To veterans this is nothing, it's just we have more scared newcomers than during any other drop.

You don't need to "whale watch" in fact quite the opposite. Ignore them. Buy when bitcoin is cheap, and hodl.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:27:15
And so it is time to buy.

That's not how inflation works in relation to bitcoin. Bitcoin is actually gaining value.
