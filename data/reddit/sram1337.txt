I'm seeing many posts criticizing this video, but I think he raises a lot of fair points. I am very new to crypto so please enlighten me if I'm off-base on any of my interpretations of his claims.
 Argument 1: He believes Crypto currencies are in a bubble
This is to say crypto currencies are showing huge growth, which attracts speculators who drive the demand/price up and perpetuate the "bubble".  Prices are determined by the traders, not the holders, so a horde of hyped up speculators can really jack up the price.  This isn't to say Bitcoin is worthless, just overvalued. I can see the argument for this.
 Argument 2: Bitcoin is losing market share to competitors with superior implementations
Bitcoin is experiencing some growing pains other tokens are not currently experiencing. What prevents another currency from implementing a better blockchain or adding valuable features that are objectively better than bitcoin? Why is Ethereum not a better currency than bitcoin?
 Argument 3: The only current use of Bitcoin in commerce is for criminals / no merchant can accept them
Its true that a merchant with tiny margins cannot afford to be paid in *and hold onto* Bitcoin due to it being so volatile.  If I own a small business and eek out ~5% profit margin, the last thing I want to worry about is having all my revenue in bitcoin and suddenly having it drop 10%. I think he makes a great point in that any business accepting bitcoin is really just immediately selling them for market value.. which is exactly the same as the buyer first selling them at market value then giving the cash to the merchant.  Merchants won't risk holding bitcoin until its price is stable.  If no one wants to hold your currency you don't really have a currency.
