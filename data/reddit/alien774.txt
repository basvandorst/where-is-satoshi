But do you really expect the government's response to be anything other than: "lolwut? wheres ur papers.ujail?"

A pyramid scheme that offered 3000 % yearly gains. To put that in perspective, Bernie Madoff promised 18 %.

Does having bitcoin help in the mortagage process? Does it count as 'assets' they take into account?
@_date: 2013-07-23 03:26:41
It would probably only take a couple million bucks to 51% kill bitcoin

NSA has quantum supercomputers, they will be able to break the encryption.

its a bubble. if you already made 2-3-4X profits id get out now :)

Yes, there are two capital gains taxes you will pay. One for state, and one for federal. These replace traditional federal and state income tax. 
Use this calculator to figure out exactly how much you will owe:
To figure out your state's capital gains rate, refer to this chart midway down:

if anyone has doubts about the true value of bitcoin, ask yourself. "Is bernake still printing $80 billion a month? is bernake still printing $100 million an hour? Is your dollar still losing value every minute? And how is Europe btw?" I will be buying, bitcoin is a major player. Its purpose has never been about shopping. Not everyone has realized that yet.

and to get rid of the hassle of shareholders and his private investors. now he gets to keep 100 % of the profits.
@_date: 2013-09-18 16:49:14
I think you can nitpick some details but overall I am looking forward to how it plays out, considering the financial collapse in Europe. We finally get to see how Bitcoin will play out on the ground level, with real people.

Public defender, ugh. I guess it is not surprising that the druggies who profited millions off this guy arent willing to come together and hire OJs lawyer. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 19:31:17
He promised 1 % daily profit, that is so insane, how did people fall for that?
@_date: 2013-07-18 06:33:16
Not at all, it is in the contract and he had a 'right'. Whatever. It is just astounding how much he profited off his shareholders and how little they received in return. If you read the IPO thread on bitcointalk it is filled with his sweet talk over months and months. I'm pretty sure he planned this from the beginning.

you stole that from youtube comments!

he could have some inside info, and reason to believe he has to act quick. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 22:57:09
nice mental gymnastics, I hope Erik hires you for his next scam. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 02:56:52
This pirate guy had the skill to scam so many people, but for what? He had no real plan for it. Just fucked around with it, sat on his ass and blew it. Even could have been rich and retired in Brazil. 
That's the most disappointing part of this because the people who gave him their coins, the bitcoin boom would have changed their lives. Just a waste all around.

That still doesn't protect you, I had paypal pull $$ right out of my bank account, and reverse deals at will.

I dont trust that scott adams isnt every one of the comments here.

We need some accountability for this, WSJ and that other journalist.. because this story caused a big crash in competing Mining company shares and made people lose a lot of $$. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 22:25:20
Without silkroad, bitcoin would have never caught on. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 02:09:21
that still kinda sucks that they only broke even. it sounds like only you got to profit out of this whole thing, making the whole thing a failure.
@_date: 2013-07-18 06:46:23
I'm with you, this guy is pure sleaze. users don't know the full story of the many ways which he screwed his shareholders these last few months. It is ingenious really. We need someone to do a full expose on this and let users decide themselves.
@_date: 2013-08-24 22:10:18
What are your thoughts on ActiveMining? 
@_date: 2013-07-13 04:26:49
Too bad gold has lost 40 % of its value in the last year, probably ruined a lot of people.
@_date: 2013-08-30 22:43:04
So if SHA-256 is ever cracked, can bitcoin survive it? could devs switch the code to a more secure one?
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:52:15
It means hiring hitmen. This guy is scum. Really hope the feds made that part up. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 01:14:09
I believe he sold 13 million shares, ~~giving him about 500,000 bitcoins~~ (I was a decimal off). Ran his business into the ground, then sold it for a fraction of that. Not to mention the inside trading. ~~The most profitable scam in bitcoin history for sure, this beats pirate.~~ pirate is still king
