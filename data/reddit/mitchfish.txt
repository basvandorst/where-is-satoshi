I think they used incorrect terminology in this article. The speed is referenced in TeraBYTES but is abbreviated in "Tbps." Lowercase 'b' denotes a bit. Right?

I'm not copying word for word, I'm just checking to make sure what I have  written is accurate. I'm not trying to have anything I've done critiqued.

Skating using gravity and your body. Plus I don't see how going 15 mph on a board could be fun. If i were with friends with real boards, they could go much faster than me, and also do tricks. It would suck.

This seems incredibly lame. Especially for around .8 BTC. For that money you could get a very special real board for real skating.

Washington Post has a relatively strong journalistic integrity. I think they rarely, if ever, print lies. It makes me groan when people use "fake news" to describe an opinion they don't agree with. WaPo is being quoted from what is presumably an editorial on bitcoin. If the opinion were based on non-factual items, then it would be fake news. But that seems very unlikely, because again they have a very good reputation and tend to report honestly, avoid infotainment, etc.

I'll bet if you look up the article that is being quoted, its an editorial where there is clear labeling. It's sometimes called the opinion section. I think you are referring to TV journalism where icons blend news with their opinion. But in this case its print media, which is usually quite good at disclaiming the fact that its an opinion, especially since its from the Post.

So then you're treating it as a commodity rather than a revolution in currency. It annoys me how this sub treats bitcoin as something you can "buy" instead of discussing it's merits as a currency. Currencies have exchange rates. If anything, Bitcoin's extreme fluctuations makes it seem weaker because of it inconsistency.
