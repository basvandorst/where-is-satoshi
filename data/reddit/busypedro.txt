Took me a while to realise when you say BTC you mean bitcoin Cash, or am I wrong? Bitcoin Cash is usually written as BCH rather than BTC.

There would be if there was any popular support for your ideas, but there isn’t, so there isn’t.

Yeah imagine how terrible it is to want people to be able to have democratic control over their own workplace and life. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:20:04
That literally not what far left means

Man are you kidding me? Liberalism is the exact opposite of socialism. Here is Mao specifically going after liberals  
I already linked you to a definition of liberalism, it’s not my fault that America constantly misuses political terms. 
Going back to your original point, far-left means political ideologies that call for the complete abolition of the capitalist mode of production. Bernie does not advocate for this, he is a mere social democrat which means he is a centre-left politician, and a liberal.

Sorry I think then I misunderstood your point about free coin drops, my apologies. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:30:42
10% in a day followed by the same thing numerous times over the past month is though. I'm not worried but saying 10% isn't much of a dip is pretty misleading.

You can opt out by leaving the jurisdiction of the laws and services that have been provided by the government of that area, through a mandate derived from the people in a free election, and move to Somalia which is the rule-less lawless utopia you so crave.

Yes, in far-left ideologies private property (the means of production) can only be owned collectively by the all of the workers in a company, not just the person at the top. Personal property is of course different to private property. 
If you seriously think Bernie is anything other than centre-left you need to leave the insular bubble in which you live. Have you ever left the US? In my, very capitalist country the Democrat party in the US would be considered our most right wing party (economically speaking).

The fact that capitalism says “You can be an artist but you’re going to make 40k per year max unless people really love you”isn’t a sign that it bans people from having control over their own workplace and life. It’s a sign that it privatizes the costs of your own actions onto yourself and makes you solely responsible for your life, rather than socializing the costs of your choices so that Jennifer in Seattle is paying $50 a month against her will so Ted in New York can turn his graffiti from a thing he does after his real job into a full career.
I’m sorry but these two paragraphs display a complete misunderstanding of what communism is, so there’s no real point in me trying to debate this with you and counter these points, since it doesn’t describe what communism is. I am more than happy to provide you with resources about communism and then chat with you about the finer points, but you currently seem to be under some illusion that communism is some kind of high-tax version of a nation state as we currently have them. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:51:25
No but your answers are so amerocentric it shows a lack of understanding of the outside world. Your explaination of how unionized jobs in the civil service somehow relate to elected officials shows a basic misunderstanding of what government is or how it works. And finally my point is not really anything to do with the state, since I do agree that the state should be abolished and that it seeks to self-preserve, but that your view that you individually should be allowed to abstain from taxes because you feel like it is silly because the popular and democratic choice of the people in your jurisdiction is for the provision of certain services in exchange for taxes. Whether this is expressed through democratic elections, through armed rebellion or though any other means is sort of irrelevant when the point is about popular support.
So no, it’s not cognitive dissonance that made me decide not to respond, it’s that you have such a deliberate misunderstanding of the very core concepts of politics and governance that it makes having any sort of argument sort of pointless or impossible. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:01:37
There’s no point in continuing this when you’re so committed to not trying to learn or even understand anything.

Just to add that the ideology of bitcoin is also entirely comparable with far-left values of decentralized power, community ownership, etc. it’s really only centrists and statists that might have a problem with it but why don’t we all just get along!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:24:29
Yeah well if people know what communism actually was it probably would be voluntary for almost everyone

I don’t agree with him here, but he’s a very very good economist.

I’m in Europe and I haven’t seen a single place taking bitcoin cash , and very few taking bitcoin itself to be fair

Middle class never existed, there are only workers and exploiters. Middle class is an illusion to keep workers fighting among themselves.

I have to manually navigate to a website and input username and password, furthermore the loading times will be longer as the website has to load elements an app doesn't.


My phone already does this anyway. They can use 2-factor authentication on the execution of a trade, as many apps do anyway. So this is pretty much a non-issue.
I don't even understand why you're arguing this. Fine if you don't feel like it would be more convenient for you but I am *telling* you that it would be more convenient *for me*. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:13:48
Laughable to think that it will only be in 5 states. Of course it will expand when they are ready, which is better than rushing into things unplanned and unable to manage.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:45:27
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:06:09
Sure, it's not hard, but an app is more convenient.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:29:55
I don’t think you understand percentages

Let’s be honest, this community can be borderline psychotic at times
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:12:27
You don't have to log in to the app every time. My phone is password and fingerprint locked so I'm not too concerned. Sure, of course you can use the website but it's a lot more effort than just checking quickly in to the app numerous times a day to quickly see the price and then switching to facebook or reddit or whatever else you use.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:03:20
It's nicer to have an app to trade easily on the go
