Sadly that's not what I'm looking for. I can drive 2 hours to a bitcoin ATM in the city if need be, but I was hoping for something that wouldn't require me to leave my computer chair.

See, I only have a debit card, and that's linked to the same bank account that I'm already using on coinbase.
LOL Looks like I'm SOL this time around. Gonna have to drive to Dallas. Dagnabit.

Totally wasn't begging. Was commenting on the ridiculousness of the situation, thought it'd give you all a laugh. Looks like it did! 
Already have my day planned tomorrow. I've got it figured out. Thanks everyone for the attempts to help!
Edit: You also don't know my situation or why it would be personal enough for me to be that important. It IS important enough for me to go ahead and go up there.

Just tried them and they require a 3 day waiting period after adding a debit/credit card.
It's a hell of a situation. Need 5 dollars in bitcoin by monday morning, and I'm about to drive an hour and a half to Dallas to use their bitcoin ATM to make that happen. LMAO. I guess it's my own fault for not thinking ahead.

Wait time is the problem

No thanks, kind human! I really appreciate the offer, but I already made the trip and got 20 bucks worth of BTC! 
What a gent! Merry Christmas to you!!!

This is actually a good opportunity! I've been pretty sickened by what I've been seeing at the Islamic Center in Irving lately with people standing outside in camo holding long rifles and harassing Muslims going to pray. Atheist white guy here, but I thought it'd be cool to go pray with them during on of their alloted times of day. Have to be in the area for that to be possible, so I'll just use tomorrow to kill two birds with one stone.
