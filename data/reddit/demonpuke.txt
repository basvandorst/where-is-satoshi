Look up on Google for a Bitcoin Wallet (there are some both for PC and Phones) and it gives you a receiving address within that wallet, that's where you withdraw your Bitcoin to and store it until you either want to sell it or buy something with it or move it.

I hope the guy doesn't have any malicious intentions, I was thinking though when you mention tax free bitcoin in some countries there is always the problem of having to explain a deposit to the bank if ever asked or if you get audited so for anyone selling in a place like that I recommend paying the appropriate taxes. congrats on your first sale on bisq though. !lntip 420

Mining and running a node are completely different things, the same equipment you use to run a node cannot mine.  I simply run a node off of my gaming computer but it is near impossible and a waste of energy to stat mining with it.  Electrum relies on other nodes to download blocks and verify transactions so if you want to be the most secure you must run your own node with the Bitcoin Core program.  Running a node uses barely any computer resources and if you have unlimited bandwidth there is no reason to not have a node online.

There's ways to calculate the mining power and you can see yourself how much you would be making but in all honesty there's just no way phones can compete with today's ASICs but what you can do is run your own Bitcoin node off of each cell phone.

KYC is bad in a lot of cases, most people dont want an exchange to have their personal information stored on a database and dont want to wait for permission from the exchange to buy or sell, bisq doesnt care who you are and doesn't need to know who you are.  How is this a downfall? Volume has been growing a lot anyways with  about 28.8 million in USD for the month of June with about an average of 94 trades per day.

So I just got done talking to someone I don't know personally and they we're talking about Bitcoin to me as they know I like it a lot and this person apparently knows someone else that's working with the direct person who invented Bitcoin and they're a multi millionare.....literally...that's what they said, it was like a little tid bit convo and it ended after that cause all I said was wow cool. now I didn't want to spill the beans and lay all the facts down about Satoshi nakamoto disappearing and there's almost no possible way her friend is working with him cause this was a random person and not the actual person who told her, because of this I think she got deceived by this person and I just let her go. The first thought that comes to mind is a bcasher but idk, does anybody have any thoughts how someone could say they're working with the inventor of Bitcoin and what they could possibly mean or try to achieve by saying this?

@_date: 2019-07-07 17:49:29
The whole reason why I created this post was to help get BISQ out there, the more people talking about BISQ and using BISQ the more trades there will be and with more people and more money comes more volume so hopefully if we work together and keep talking about BISQ it will grow within the community, if everyone sat and waited nothing would happen so if this post has inspired you at least a little please go make your own post, talk about it and recommend BISQ to people when they ask where they should go.

Sadly no, I don't really know how to read source code to verify and stuff as I'm just a consumer but I believe in Bitcoin and I can understand that this is a cool thing that you've made here and I can honestly see it getting implemented into the core program as like a checkbox or something when sending a transaction.

Like the other commenter said sounds like a scam, how would coinBTM know if it was your wallet or not? In my opinion it's none of coinBTMs business at all. Use another BTM the one down the street from me take your cash you scan the code and it sends it right then and there with a receipt.

He could be talking about a way to make the Bitcoin in-game by means of not mining but by completing objectives ingame and getting rewarded with BTC possibly and in return the company makes money off of ads or something to keep paying out their playerbase, that's my guess.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:02:24
I'm not sure if other ATM's are different but the one at my local convenience store (Canada) you can only buy and there is no identification required and it only takes cash, you feed it however much cash you want (I'm guessing you could just keep putting money in to buy a full Bitcoin I can't see why not you'd probably be standing there for awhile doing it though) and it scans the QR code on your phone and you verify the address once it scans and press confirm or whatever and it goes through, what I noticed though was they sell Bitcoin at a higher rate than you would get off of an online exchange, at the time of my purchase they charged around $1000 more for a Bitcoin than it would have costed on coinbase.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:42:32
Actively talk about and teach people how it works and how they can get into it (obviously don't annoy people about it)  real life examples is a really good way to help someone understand, whip out your phone show them how a transaction works, be friendly and explain the early adoption phase and all that, work on possibly managing your own Bitcoin ATM, a Bitcoin ATM does wonders even if people aren't using it because people still see it and think about it, there's many more ways as well these are just a couple examples, good luck man :)

Personally you need to identify what kind of user you are going to be, are you true believer? Are you dreaming of a worldwide currency being Bitcoin? Then you buy and HODL and use the currency when you see fit and hopefully make some profit in the long run
Or you could be a trader, someone who is Watching technical analysis videos/livestreams, doing research on price movements and getting involved in discord servers, telegram chats etc but you need to be aware of the taxes in your area so you don't get fucked over by the government
Personally i think it boils down to those two categories in my opinion as a consumer and you kinda just decide what lifestyle is right for you and during this whole process you learn about Bitcoin itself, how it works and how you can support the network and move Bitcoin forward as a currency.
Just wait for the dips and buy periodically or dump a huge sum in all at once and forget about it.
This is not financial advice in any way I'm just sharing my opinion, take what you want out of it.

It's my understanding as time goes on and as more bitcoins get mined it gets harder to mine and the reward output for each completed block is lowered over time, essentially making bitcoins harder to obtain, correct me if I'm wrong as I'm still learning and fairly new here.

it's hard to say because the network is always changing in terms of fees, if the network isn't that packed and most people are putting really low fee's it would not take that long, but for example during the December 2017 spike a 1 SAT fee would have taken 3 months.
EDIT: there are third party sites or wallets that can give you an idea of what kind of fee you should put for the most optimal experience.

If I we're you I'd just use the Bitcoin ATM's in your area if you're lucky enough to have one near you this early, they're the easiest to use in my opinion, walk in, put cash in the machine and scan your wallet QR code with your phone (I use electrum) and it sends it right away, the nice thing about ATM's is everything happens right there infront of you and there's no hassle of signing up for anything or verifying stuff. If you have cash and a working wallet on your phone you can do it.

Until we live in a financial world where bitcoin can be freely used anywhere everywhere or at least mostly so we don't have to convert back to fiat to successfully buy most things, yes the government could identify wallet addresses if the transfer is used through a bank (because the bank has all your info) but say if you transferred back to fiat through a BTM (correct me if I'm wrong I may be missing something) they would be unable to identify who got the cash from a certain bitcoin address.

Good question! All Bitcoin wallets have private keys and public keys, public keys are for the public to send you Bitcoin easily, private keys is what you don't want to show people and what you didn't see on the video and THAT is what is used to send.  *Fun Fact* online exchanges carry all the Bitcoin and don't let their customers have the private key and do it for them when they need to send so it is a good idea to move Bitcoin off of online exchanges as soon as you can to a wallet where you own the private keys, you can learn more here Bitcoin.org

Hopefully soon Electrum will implement lightning network capabilities but for now if you want to experiment with lightning and experience literally instant transactions with single Satoshi fees you can start with a phone app called blue wallet, I know it's more downloading and learning but the lightning network is really cool and worth it to at least try it, some merchants actually already use the LN.

This is how bitcoins privacy works, yes we see the wallet doing stuff but the only way we will ever know who owns it or what the intentions with it are is if the owner themselves reveals it or it gets leaked. I've heard of some governments creating some sort of wallet detective to try and track down and figure out the identity of a wallet owner by tracking transactions and digging around for info and stuff though so that's kinda interesting.

It is recommended to use a new address for every transaction as that adds to your privacy so someone cannot track your transactions going in and out with a single address as they are spread out among multiple addresses, and yeah no problem this is exciting and cool stuff!

Electrum is software you can download on your android phone and on your desktop and is an amazing piece of software I must say, it's been around since the early days with many features and is really awesome and completely free, check it out yourself at Electrum.org once you save the seed phrase for your wallet it functions just like any other except you keep your own seed and keep your own private keys.  Any wallet can create as many addresses as you want.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:04:07
There should be a screen where you can see your balance for different cryptos on coinbase, if you select Bitcoin it should take you to a send and receiving screen and you simply punch in your receiving address for your wallet and send away.  If you do not have your own wallet I would suggest the Electrum wallet.  Please double check you've correctly copied your address before sending, and if you have anymore questions feel free to reply.

Ask what YOU can do for bitcoin is a really good one, I feel like there's a lot of people who are simply hodling and waiting for everything to just happen, even the small things count like having a conversation about it with someone or accepting donations with a QR code displayed in public can do so much with so little work.

They are new addresses tailored for your wallet, wallets let you choose if you want to create a new address everytime or not but it seems trezor has it defaulted to on because there is really no downsides to using a new address every time, addresses are stagnant forever as well so if a year down the line someone wants to send you Bitcoin to an address you gave them way back it will still work.
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:16:42
I mean, if you could provide a reason for me to feel sketched out by this i'm all ears but that is the beauty of a decentralized platform like the Bitcoin Network, he cant control it and he cant stop it and he probably sees the value in bitcoin.  Anything he does with bitcoin in terms of what he does will only prop bitcoin up higher. (first example that comes to my mind is tipping twitter posts in a similar way that we tip eachother on this forum) Any attempt to control or destroy bitcoin will only hurt him, his name and his business.
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:00:53
Thanks for taking interest in my opinion I appreciate that, so I feel like Bitcoin will become the people's currency everyone if not almost everyone will have bitcoin because there really is no reason not too it's basically like your own personal bank of funds you can use anywhere in the world (and to other planets when we start colonizing as long as there is internet or satalites there will be Bitcoin)
It can be liquidated into any other currency and with global travel being perfected meaning we can travel to many countries quickly (we sort of already can with planes) so for people who travel a lot or will be traveling a lot they will only need Bitcoin for their daily business, this is also a godsend for merchants as they don't need to convert currency and can accept payments digitally easily.
And finally because there is no single entity or server controlling Bitcoin there is no possible way Bitcoin can be destroyed or tampered with that gives me the confidence to hold my worth in bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not going anywhere and many people will try to copy Bitcoin (shitcoins, Facebook's libra and who knows what's next) but nothing else will ever simply be Bitcoin, I could go on and on and on but I'm better at answering questions lol. Thanks for reading.

It is not hard to imagine at all Bitcoin is already on it's way to becoming a global currency because anybody all over the world can choose to use it whenever they decide to do so and is already happening, the security the network has cannot compare with other shitcoins even if they wanted to be like Bitcoin there's a massive fear of a 51% attack or the developers simply running out of money Imo those are the biggest fears when holding crypto and you simply do not need to worry with Bitcoin.
 Also it does not need a government body to force itself upon the public and more and more people all over the world are starting to use it and people are willing to educate others about it and get them started like myself.
And what I mean by Bitcoin is designed to appreciate over time is because there's a hard cap on the supply and every four years a halvening occurs it doesn't take a smart person to realize that demand and adoption = the value skyrocketing, so the earlier you buy Bitcoin and hold onto it the more you will be rewarded in the future.
you made me realize something though and I will change how I think about crypto....Bitcoin to shitcoins is like Gold to FIAT and hardforks of Bitcoin are like fools gold. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 06:10:35
I got two words for you man "digital scarcity" If that guy going to jail has everything under control (safely storing the seed phrase in his brain or somewhere else) and if there is only 21 million bitcoin's in existence with the amount getting minted being reduced as each halvening comes along meaning bitcoin is becoming rarer and rarer while economies are being built ontop of it how could you not think it will be extremely valuable? there are many under the table coin tumbling services and even more ways to privatize bitcoin (first thing that comes to mind is what wasabi wallet is trying to do) he's gunna be rich af when he gets out.
@_date: 2019-02-05 04:23:46
Nobody is telling you to trust an online exchange, there has been an insane amount of work put in by the community to educate people on the saying "not your keys not your coins" at this point ten years down the road if people are still moronically leaving their bitcoins on an online exchange instead of securing it in their own wallet they control is simply ignorant and we as a community still need to preach "not your keys not your coins" this happening is yet another reason to keep your bitcoins out of other people's hands and in your own, do not confuse an exchange fucking up a Bitcoin Network problem because it is totally different.

Lol! Okay so in the simplest terms, there's a thing called the lightning network that works on-top of Bitcoin, basically makes transactions instant (zero confirmation)  the fees are literally single satoshis and that basically allows us to explore new things but it is still in early stages, and someone designed a bot where if you load it up using lightning you can actually tip other people instantly and you can actually withdraw or deposit more using commands in a Direct message to the bot.

There's a BTM in my area that does not ask for any sort of ID or anything. You put in the cash and it scans your wallets receiving address and it sends it right then and there and also pops out a receipt of the transaction.  You can also sell as well but I don't do that.

A taxable event would be when you sell BTC for CAD and you need to pay 50% of what you made in capital gains to the CRA
When paying for a good or service it is considered a barter transaction and the merchant does the taxes.

That is NOT the only reason what so ever, in my other comment I said something about hyperinflated countries, people in those situations NEED Bitcoin.  That in itself will drive the value of bitcoin up. 
Another reason why people would use Bitcoin over FIAT is there would be no need for a conversion rate as Bitcoin is Bitcoin all over the world I can easily buy something from India by sending the merchant Bitcoin and he can then spend his Bitcoin in india and vice versa if someone is buying something from me it's all the same.
Bitcoin has many variables involved and you really need to step back to see the entire picture to see just how valuable it is.

It depends on how you are acquiring them in the first place, let's say If you're getting Bitcoins as a gift or you're working for Bitcoins there would not be a fee on your end (if we count the miners fee for the sender) let's say if you buy bitcoins off of coinbase then there would be a fee enforced by coinbase themselves.

He does not get away with his fraud a perfect example is you calling him fake Satoshi and 99% in this space are with you and call him a fraud, everybody is simply waiting for him to sign a transaction out of the real Satoshi Nakamoto's wallet and he has failed to do so leaving us with the only conclusion that he is not Satoshi therefore we do not need to talk about him or give him any attention or we are feeding into his game.  There's nothing the authorities can do because there's simply no regulation and no real identity to match with Satoshi so there's no real evidence that he is actually impersonating someone, for all we know Satoshi Nakamoto could be a group of people.  So it's definitely a grey area when it comes to the authorities but for us we can simply see through his lies and over time it will come down on him.

"It's all thin air, you dont own anything" wrong you actually own bitcoin which is recorded on the blockchain, your bitcoins are traced all the way back to the birth of the coins from the mining process meaning that you very well own bitcoin and there is proof that it is yours and only yours to do with what you please.

A ton of programming surrounding Bitcoin and such is completely volunteer, that's what makes this amazing. these selfess programmers and developers are donating their time to contribute to the space and it is amazing and we will never be able to thank them enough. A lot of developers can take donations in some form, and also by helping make the space improve and holding Bitcoin, if the value in Bitcoin rises from their combined actions they get rewarded in that sense as well. Investors and entrepreneurs will invest and hire lucky programmers and such for projects so those people lucky enough to get hired in this space can make a living off of that.

Hello, I had a question I was hoping could be answered here I'm looking at metal card wallets with your information on the card, now here is my question.  On the card there's an option to stamp your private key onto the back side of the key and the public key is on the front, aren't we supposed to to hide the private key and not let anyone see it? By putting it on the back of the card that you carry around would that be considered a dumb thing to do? I was caught off guard by it simply asking if I wanted my private key on it cause I thought nobody was ever supposed to have them except me so why would anyone have one in the open?

Alright so i got around to messing around with it, so far it is in extremely early development requiring you to agree to testing the unreleased app, there is no fancy UI or anything it's very basic (probably because of early development) but the first thing i noticed the logo of the app is not that green shield we're seeing on github its a blue circle with a white bitcoin logo for the app on my phone, secondly the reason why its called ABCore is because that is short for "Android Bitcoin Core" despite it's similarity with bcash and ABC and the green shield thing it has nothing to do with that altcoin thankfully.  When you first start the app there is literally an on and off switch to start connecting to the network and doing stuff so you can decide when you want your node on or off easily.  I'm currently connecting to peers and just downloading the blockchain now on my android and there is pruning enabled,  so far so good i guess lol.

Technically anybody can "track" bitcoin, every single coin is tracked on the blockchain from its birth all the way to your wallet and then from where you send it.  Say if somehow the IRS got a hold of your bitcoin address that they somehow connected to your name then they could see every wallet you've received coins from and sent coins too within that address.

Government's will adapt to bitcoin (fuck altcoins) and develop a new system around bitcoin once they realize they cannot control or tamper with or find out who the creator of bitcoin is so they will build around it if they can.  When this happens one of two things pop into my head, the government will seamlessly work with bitcoin (Possibility of a Bitcoin Standard functioning similar to the gold standard?) and encourage hand in hand use to help the Economy and will help bitcoin.  Or They will TRY to Control/Destroy bitcoin which in my eyes will end in the US Economy declining even more but weirdly enough like my first theory it will still help bitcoin  because if they try to obtain any bitcoin in the controlling process it will prop up the price benefiting previous hodlers and if they try and Destroy bitcoin the publicity it will be shining on bitcoin will increase awareness and also create underground adoption.
Edit: After re-reading my comment my final word would have to be that the sooner the Government get's involved with bitcoin in a positive open minded way the sooner and the more they will benefit from it.

because that's what makes it sound money, it's inflation pattern is set out for everyone to see theres no loopholes or fuckery, if bitcoin became really valuable then a bunch of people would start mining it to make more money, essentially dropping the price from the increase of supply that is why the difficulty mechanism was added in so the supply never changes from its plan to slowly appreciate over time. the value outside of mining is being apart of the network contributing to verifying transactions, securing it and making extra btc off of transactions.

If everyone could only create one address for the rest of their entire life and only use that one address i feel like blacklisting can work, but how is blacklisting addresses effective when literally anyone can create any number of addresses as much as they want?  What's  stopping an owner of a blacklisted address from simply creating a whole new wallet with new addresses and everything?  this is the question i would be asking myself if i was the OFAC.  They still do not understand and it will take awhile for them to start.

You'd be surprised as to how many people don't know about Bitcoin let alone understand what a node does not to mention what entails running one.  We just passed the 10 year milestone we will get there my friend :)
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:28:47
Well, is it showing up in your wallet just unconfirmed or is it simply not showing up? if it's  the sender did not type in your address correctly or simply has not sent it, if its  then the sender did not set a high enough fee and you could ask him to edit the fee and make it higher if their wallet supports it.

So with my example with entrepreneurs and Investors plus with the price rise in december this can apply here.  People who we're in this space that previously held Bitcoin and other people that are interested in it now that have a bunch of Fiat can create a company and it can be fueled with a stockpile of money wether that be BTC or Fiat. They aren't really "selling" anything but they are selflessly contributing to the Bitcoin network by helping develop this second layer tech and make money from investors investing in the company and when the value of Bitcoin rises they can use some.

Firstly I'd have to recommend the Electrum wallet. They have an Android version and a Desktop version and it syncs together, I use my Android to buy things and transact in person and then I use the desktop wallet to buy things online with BTC using a number of different sites, some that I can recommend are purse.io, purse is basically Amazon but you can use Bitcoin to purchase things (you get a sick discount for using BTC too) another good site is keysforcoins.com if you like videogames you can get a bunch on that site for Bitcoin, and a third and final suggestion would be coincards.ca get gift cards from all sorts of businesses with your BTC. Other than actively using Bitcoin and restocking your supply just simply talk about it with people, get the word out and answer everyones questions if you can. Even if you help only one person get into Bitcoin that's one more person you helped that's buying and using bitcoin and that's amazing.

They would get profits by holding Bitcoin if lightning is a massive success and helps boost the value of Bitcoin.

I cannot believe how ignorant I was of financial systems and I also can't believe how confusing it is once I started to try and learn it, Bitcoin was definitely a massive wake up call for me and actually got me to think about the future and make a plan whereas before I really did not care...thank you Bitcoin for giving me hope.

Honestly that is so far away into the future that I can't really possibly say what will happen but if you want my theory, its that Bitcoin will be so valuable and expensive from it being scarce and the demand surrounding it that even though we aren't mining new bitcoin the BTC you make from fees will be enough to keep the incentive of mining high, there are no stupid questions in this space things are constantly evolving here, Bitcoin just turned ten years old and so much has changed and happened it's insane.
@_date: 2019-01-13 09:43:10
"having gold or BTC as a currency" I honestly like the passion behind your explanation but i have to point out I said if the countries currencies we're backed by BTC not civilian people actually physically transacting BTC in the same sense that we don't transact with gold on the streets but the central banks do hoard the gold and regulate the flow of government currency, why not hoard btc as well and run off of some sort of Bitcoin standard? 
@_date: 2019-01-13 03:13:16
What would you guys think of a country like India or China backing their currency with bitcoin. I wonder how they would go about storing it, getting it and i also wonder if they would make the wallets publicly known.  
EDIT: And I was also thinking if countries we're to start backing their currencies with bitcoin the sooner a country does it the sooner they'd start benefiting as it could snowball.  very interesting.

They could try but they would need to cover all angles, they would need to somehow unlock the millions of coins lost due to poor keeping of information, they would need to centralize every single miner and make sure they are the ones finalizing a block every single time to get the reward and no one else somehow, and then they would need to somehow purchase all the bitcoin that everybody has right now and i guess everybody has their price but i can guarantee there will be some people refusing to give up their bitcoin. THEN after all these impossible situations then it could be controlled by those 100 whales. Remember value from bitcoin comes from it's use and people willing to buy it and if nobody wants it or uses it, it is not valuable.
EDIT: Also by those whales buying up all the bitcoin they can see they would essentially drive the price up making bitcoin more expensive and the more people that get some the harder it is for the whales to control.  Everybody who had bitcoin before this whale attack would make everybody a bunch of money.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:46:04
you realize you can actively swap your coins to any wallet however much you want? the purpose of this post is yet another reminder to keep your bitcoin safe because i ran into a friend that still was not aware of the concept of not your keys not your bitcoin and everybody should be aware of this, if you are a trader or a hodler or someone who actively using bitcoin you should always keep your bitcoin safe. leaving your bitcoin in someone else's hands is very risky.

If you want a serious answer, get a cell phone and download BRD wallet for IOS and Electrum for Android and get cash and go to a Bitcoin ATM, they aren't like an online exchange you do not need ID or sign up to anything for an ATM.

See that's the thing about Bitcoin, it's powered by the people for the people if you really want real world usage to pick up you could actually contribute to the space and work towards it yourself with your own means and ideas, if nobody ever did this bitcoin would never be where it is today it is because of the people that Bitcoin has made it this far.  If you're one of the few people that understand Bitcoin and it's fundamentals pick up the torch and push forward don't just ask around and wait for someone else to do it. There are many of us working towards building a future with Bitcoin so just give it time my friend, bitcoin just reached ten years old recently we will get there.

Relax LN is fine and like you said it is in beta there are many more upgrades, changes, advances and bug fixes to be done, merchants and businesses would be the ones creating nodes and civilians would be creating channels to as many things as they want.  I myself have only opened a single channel with a main node and I've been able to send lightning payments anywhere without any trouble so far,  and I think watch towers is enabled because I can simply close the app and not worry about it and re open it and my balance and stuff is all ready to go. I'm using the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet for Android
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:16:55
Very good point, I have another question for you, what is stopping a blacklisted address from tumbling his/her coins or simply dropping coins in random wallets? Would they blacklist every single wallet used in the tumbling process all the way down to minsecule denominations? And what if somehow my wallet has some of these tainted coins dropped in, is my wallet address now suddenly blacklisted? Because there is no way to prevent somebody from sending you coins once they find your receiving address and send it.
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:45:11
What you're saying makes a lot of sense, with the information from this conversation I can imagine the government having a sector specifically for monitoring the blockchain for these kinds of threats and keeping track of "tainted coins" but without any control of the network all they can do is prevent use of the coins on their own services once they somehow account all the tainted coins? What's preventing the people from doing what they're doing now and just using Bitcoin naturaly The government can't intervene and block a transaction from happening so people will still freely use their Bitcoin regardless if they hold "tainted coins" that the government says you can't use anyways. I mean if someone came up to me and told me I can't use my Bitcoin with their service someone else would end up taking it, not to mention other countries who says they will care about these "tainted coins" I see what you're saying but the government would need to have control of the entire network and have every single wallet address linked to an identity and would need every other country to participate for this to work.

There are multiple reasons, Mining is fun if you love messing with tech, and Technically you are not mining at a loss if you are mining more bitcoin in dollar value than you are spending on energy and since more miners are looking towards renewable sources of energy a miner is simply passively gaining bitcoin and spending barely any money to get it.  Buying bitcoin is a one time purchase whereas if you're mining it you are constantly getting bitcoin till you turn that thing off so in the end its just economically smart to start mining in a place with cheap energy or if you have a renewable energy setup and get some bitcoin.

If you had a crystal ball that tells the future i would take your advice, but the very fact that this is an open global market where anything can happen and magical crystal balls dont exist you can only HOPE it goes down after selling, and if it does not and you sold you will be kicking yourself harder than when you we're if you just simply HODL

its a severe inconvenience to be able to pay for something one day and the NEXT time you try to do something they put up this huge wall you have to go over before spending again.  he is simply pointing out that this is not needed when we have something like bitcoin.  Once adopting and accepting bitcoin becomes mainstream problems like this will be non-existent

In my opinion I feel like governments will adapt to crypto and countries will do it in their own way whether their approach is crpyto-friendly or not is up to them but the people will ultimately decide if they need it or not and that will decide if it takes over or not.

Keep buying DCA all the way to 0 or until you're happy with what you have, with this mentality as soon as it starts going up you enjoy the ride because technically 0 is the floor and it can only go up from there ;)

Think of Bitcoin as the gold standard for crypto.  It will always be the best one because it is truly decentralized and organically grew from the ground up with zero marketing team zero advertising and has the longest chain with the most security and adoption, no other coin can compare in those aspects.  Technically no matter what any other developer says their coin is centralized in some way as there are Original creators with power, because Satoshi Nakamoto disapeared and because it has grown so much it completely separates Bitcoin from all the rest.
@_date: 2018-12-06 07:17:24

The reason why Bitcoin users are a little bit tin foily is because of MT.GOX, we are still dealing with that shadow to this day.  Personally if you can look past the fee's coinbase is great but please remember the saying not your keys not your coins. I feel like another MT.GOX incident is bound to happen eventually.

You deposit satoshis through the lightning network via a invoice the bot gives you when you pm it the deposit command, after that you can tip people the tipping command.

If we hit zero we can only go up from there ;) lots people have made thousands of dollars in gains and are still up in their Bitcoin investment just because you had a bad experience does not mean everyone is.

This is like the sixth time we've seen around a 80% crash from the ATH, relax man. And technically 0 is the End and it can only go up from that point so wait if you think it's going that far and get some cheap BTC.

When you're adding bitcoin make sure you're using a segwit wallet.

It's a small custodial wallet to easily accept lightning payments,   you can simply cash out whenever you want to your real wallet.  This is just to make life a little easier for people during the learning phase.  This is not intended to be used as a main wallet this is just so people don't have to run a node or get software to receive BTC through the LN if i am not mistaken.  I definitely agree with the Not your keys not your coins but this will help LN adoption and we should share and push it forward during this early stage of the LN.

Anyone can create any amount of wallet's and addresses,  Most wallets create multiple addresses automatically.  If you're looking for recommendations i would say that the Electrum Wallet is amazing  , You can download Electrum on your desktop or your android.  If you're looking for an IOS wallet i would recommend BRD wallet, Remember not your keys not your coins so never hold bitcoin on an online exchange or inside a third party's hands.

Simple question here hoping it can get answered, So i found something you can do to send bitcoin to an email address or as SMS from a blog post a long time ago by [Blockchain.com]( so i created a wallet and everything but i can't find out how to do it? are there any other third party services that can allow you to do something like this?

I mean if you're on a DCA strategy then you are not phased from buying at all, and if this is your first time buying in then only people who think this is the floor would be buying in but then again that's more of a personal opinion I feel like.
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:23:17
Bitcoin is only a bad investment in bear markets. You're still experiencing massive gains if you we're involved in Bitcoin before the last winter bull run.  One year of a bear market is nothing different compared to all the different ones we've seen just relax and think about it before declaring doom and gloom

When running a bitcoin node, why should or why should i not have UPnP checked off? what does it do?
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:32:46
If you're looking for a serious answer here it is.
Back in the early days and I'm talking very early, before Bitcoin had a dollar value early.  Too my understanding The first time the price was decided was the very first ever dollar to Bitcoin transaction and the way the Bitcoin holder figured out the price  was he took the cost it took to mine a certain amount of Bitcoin and the cost it took in electricity dictated the value of the set amount to start with a base cost and from that point forward the market took it over giving us the price risings and decreaseings we have today from people buying and selling.
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:41:32
because they're putting him under a microscope and demanding information...very sensitive information...and putting it into a database to simply transact with his money.  while if he was using bitcoin it would not ask for this information, would not freeze his account and would not prevent him from doing anything like paypal is.

Just look at the numbers here, it says here that Bitcoin can only do a Max of seven transactions per second on Google, whereas if lightning we're to be implemented on a mass scale it has the ability to enable millions of transactions per second......we're going from SEVEN per second to MILLIONS per second if you ask me that's a massive leap forward in terms of adoption and usability.
