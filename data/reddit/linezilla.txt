I cannot get past Step 1 either. The error is "no question data" or something like that.

Well crap. If I get a BFL or Avalon by May ill only be making around $150 a month and declining. Why do THREE companies need to enter the market simultaneously. Waaaaaah =[
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:00:05
That's a good one, haha!
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:18:20
Aright! I read the difficulty as 350,000,000 not 35,000,000 that makes all the difference.
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:20:38
Hooollyyy crap. Glad I steered clear of that one.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:19:13
Oh you mean like the price right now on GOX? Oiy vey
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:03:09
Agreed, assuming the company in question is  going to continue and be profitable indefinitely.

hahaha, think long term? /crosses fingers
notice how i said "with bitcoins"

Yea but when he decides to sell those shares... holey Moses.

Happy cake day hardleft! Someone build this man a statue in the Bitcoin museuminhonor of his philanthropic endeavours!
@_date: 2013-02-16 21:08:21
Totally understandable, I despise PayPal anyway.
Actually, Coinbase just let me process a bank wire transfer, squeeeeeee!
How exhilarating.
Though the estimated completion time will be 6 days, at least I got my coins locked in at the current price.

I saw you mention you have shares in SatoshiDice. Would you mind detailing how many shares, their worth and when/how much payment you receive for them? Or do you not getting any direct cut of the profits, but instead the knowledge that one day you can sell it for massive profit?
And is it too late for someone like me to get in on some shares?
Thanks very much.
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:22:35
Better now than later. Perhaps S.Dice is doing us a favor in that its stress testing the system while its still immature

Bravo! You won't see this kind of global coordination anywhere but here. Welcome to the new world. I'm just glad to see it in its infancy.

Difficulty went from 4.6 to like 6.7 million after the last change. I'd bet plenty of GPU miners got disheartened by seeing their coins produced slashed and are moving to alt cryptos. Even if mathematically speaking they should have just kept on. Psychology at work

I'll buy your subscription for 2 karma. That's the highest I'm willing to go though, got bills to pay...
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:14:08
yes, but there is a hard format of the currencies that can be traded in the interim, checks, etc
@_date: 2013-03-02 00:25:32
@_date: 2013-02-17 01:00:36
I'll give it a go tomorrow if possible. Thanks!
I'm not following the form at the bottom of this page though 
How do I get the CashU credit to bitnordic? And what's with the buy for 10 USD, 50 USD, 100 USD options?
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:47:12
I hope something like that can be realized. But most communities in the states cant even lay their own dark fiber due to telco BS
@_date: 2013-02-16 21:11:11
Totally, I was actually mulling this idea around a bit earlier trying to wrap my mind around the legal ramifications of such an endeavor.
I even went so far as to secure a domain name.

Theres no local intranet in these nations at this time oddly enough. So how can you have one fork in a nation? There may be millions...

Great! So in theory if you can recoup the initial costs and a bit more for a few months of electricity before the disaster. you could keep those suckers whirring away and produce coins throughout the 'Bitcoin depression' until things pick up again.
That's a lot of hypothetical gesturing but, hmmmmmmmm.

I mean in effect all the systems are in place for what you are referring to. But there needs to be fallback systems for everyone to reach one another. No skype servers, facebook servers, google, etc etc Things are far too centralized now
China is walling itself off, but they will know how to contact each other in their country if they are severed

These kinds of scenarios are going to need  to be given a much harder look as adoption grows, especially in unstable regions.

It was mainly because a former prominent nzb paysite operator turned to the dark side and started utilizing the tech to create a business that automated take-downs.
In effect the popularity and utility of nzbmatrix and newzbin was actually allowing him to dismantle newsgroups in a quick and ordely fashion.
fuck that guy
So they decided to save the network they would have to bow out or face self-cannibalization.
