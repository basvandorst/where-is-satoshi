As you can see, (and it was also new to me before the stress test we are seeing right now) it's up to every miner to decide to mine a 1mb,2mb, 4mb, 8mb or soon 16MB or 32MB block. - So it is not necessarily guranteed the mempool will be cleared but it will be a lot easier to clean and it would be more expensive to spam the blockchain. if an attacker wants to, because to fill every 32mb block with spam is a lot more expensive than to fill every 1mb (measured on a BCH fee scale).
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:57:58
32MB blocksize increase is planned to come on may 15th. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:29:00
It really happens of a magnitude of ~10x

Over the last 3 years, users were blocked discussing against Blockstream's agenda esspecially talking about block size increases on the bitcoin block chain. They moved to r/btc to discuss this scaleling concept. Around 2 years later (august 2017) the  community 'hard forked' with Bitcoin Cash. Now Bitcoin has 2 scaleling proposals. Users have to decide what they think will scale better: BTC with Segwit&amp;Lightning or BCH with bigger blocks. 
r/bitcoincash exists btw.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:53:47
There is Bitcoin C.a.s.h for that.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:10:31
You wouldn't ask, if you knew the history
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:53:41
BCH Blocks readjust to 10minutes regardless of the hashrate.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:29:19
Well. I think this headline is misleading. There is a general tax on every product you buy of +19% called "Mehrwertsteuer" and on food 7%. It's highly probable that you have to pay those taxes with crypto too. So afterall Germany don't care where the money comes. It will collect it anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:46:17
Everyone knew Coinbase would add BCH. They said it in the beginning of August after the fork. In the end they did it one week earlier than announced. I really see no problem here for coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:37:12
Why is Segwit not lower that 1cent? I want frictionless on-chain transactions :/
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:10:22
Yeah, you are right. If those hard forks turn out to be the best for Bitcoin and are basically better than the old Bitcoin then we should have reason to call it real Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:06:18
Show me the stats. Would love to see them.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:33:35
It looks like speculation. I can't see how randomly generated bitcoin adresses can be proven to be adresses of coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:23:23
r/btc was part of the r/bitcoin community 3 years ago.
Users who were discussing block sizes increases on r/Bitcoin were blocked by thermos and other moderators of r/bitcoin. Because a block size increase is/was against blockstreams agenda / development plan for bitcoin.
This part of the community who wanted a on-scale block size increase for bitcoin created r/btc to discuss this concept.
Bitcoin Ca$h was literally 3 years in the making.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:04:13
People really don't understand that:
Segwit Lightning is the soft fork and BCH is the hard fork of Bitcoin (BTC). The hard fork was the price to pay to do the block size limit increase. AND BOTH are different scaling proposals of Bitcoin. That's all.
Both are still Bitcoin but with different scaling concepts. If you think Lightning scales better with a fundamentally change how signatures are processed go with Bitcoin Segwit/Lightning, and if you think Bitcoin Cash including how digital signatures were originally processed on Bitcoin and will scale better then go with BCH. That's why everyone received the same coins on August 1st 2017. 
It's that easy.  Coinbase is the neutral one in this debate. The market has to decide.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:30:22
It's how Bitcoin works with Segwit.  How's that not relevant to OP's post??
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:33:23
BTC&amp;LTC users are scared as hell of BCH, that's all. Afraid of the competition. :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:11:46
Free knowledge. Are you scared of the truth?
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:59:21
You already forgot December huh???
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:51:53
WOW THANKS, your arguments really convinced me that you are right. I'm enlightened now. - So back to topic: So you are cool with it that Segwit deconstructs how bitcoin originally work by removing digital signatures?
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:12:08
hmm.. right.
How expensive was this spam attack? :)
And when you can tell me...
Who paid for the spam attack? :)
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:54:44


Yes, but you don't understand me here. The merchants self-interest is it to not accept anything else then payments though there own node or there choosen and trusted nodes. Nodes that are known for that they are honest miners. Because they can be sure it will get confimed in the blockchain. Because if they exclude any other node like your set up double spend node, they just lose money by allowing potential double spend-0conf txs. So, it's not clever for them to allow all nodes.
If you sending double spends to other nodes that are not known to be honest miners, they easily don't accept your payment after all.
That's why people are trusting Bitpay or recently those new Coinbase Widgets as payments. -&gt; trusted nodes.
I totally see why someone gets the impression it wouldn't be "censorship resistant" anymore, if SM get excluded.
The answer is simple: You'll have to stick to the "consensus" rules. Be a honest miner and the network and all txs will be censorship resistant. If the network detects that your are attempting double spends (two outputs at the same time), you'll get rejected. This is not censorship. Just make one tx after another. Should be easy for a machine to detect.
Selfish mining always create a fork until they release the longer chain to the network.
And i think if you are a full node miner. Memory space isn't really the issue here: 
400GB MicroSS costs $200 TODAY!
With the volatility of Cryptocurrencies, you will be definitely able to pay for such things with no hassle. 
You need a good machine to mine profitable and have cheap electricity sources as well. This was always the case.
Data memory gets cheaper and cheaper. Until we have full 1GB blocks everyday, we will have 1TB MicroSDs for $50. I promise you that. Cryptocurrencies will force to form the electronic industry. We already seeing that at the moment with Intel and Samsung buliding/planning more efficient ASICs equipment than Bitmain. Soon we will have artificial intelligence mining cryptocurrencies. Mining is competition. Mining is capitalism. That's the cold truth. - You can't mine bitcoin profitable with our old C64.
The only real need is that mining needs to be more energy efficient/energyconsuming.
EDIT: I read the statement "Trusting miners makes PoW pointless". - I really can't see how this is the case. Trusting miners on top of PoW looks like the better solution for me than just only trust PoW. - maybe you can explain that  statement to me futher.

No brah. If your double spend is successful you gain 1k as a amazon gift card. Otherwise you pay cryptonize.it 2k for trying to fraud them. You need to pay 1k two times to make a double spend. If a double spend is successful you pay literally nothing. So, if someone is that confident to do a double spend he can do it with 2k... he or she doesn't pay 4k in total to make this attack. You need to pay twice to do a double spend. Of course you don't pay $500 twice on the checkout for a 1k amazon card. If you understand what I mean.
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:06:50
This sums it up very good, easy to understand: 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:03:00
You can do it with every product on the page, man.... show us the results. You will make  history if you are successful. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:09:30
Yeah. I checked doublespend.cash  --- Hard to tell which was supposed to be the real one.
I checked two with a "double" winning symbol, one had the problem that the original output adresse doesn't even exist and the other one had the problem of insuffient tx fees of 5 satoshi to be relayed. Of course each TX ID was deleted then.
Haven't seen a transaction which went back to the original adresse. It was always another adresse as destination. Maybe you can help me out here.


You surely heard of Pings: 
Here my last question: You send 2 txs at the same time.
One to a local merchant in a store with a Point-Of-Sale system as a node in front of you. (Low Ping)
and you send another tx as double spend to another node which is on the other site of the earth.(High Ping) - What tx will get confirmed on the blockchain?
Remember the network has the consensus of the "first seen rule" other policies will be rejected.
 
In this case of a Point-of-Sale system your are safe as a merchant with 0conf. Because the signal  takes less time to arrive in the mempool.
But in case of cryptonize.it it's rather hard for me to tell if 0conf is that much bullet proofed or not.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:36:32
I'm aware that you have to send them instant.
I assume,
You will send your double spend tx to the largest pool. Let say it has 20% hashpower of the whole network. Since nobody knows exactly who will mine the next block the largest pool has the highest probability. - What makes you so sure one of them gets rejected and not both? 
I assume it's not the tx with the highest fee. Since BCH has no Replace-By-Fee mechanism.
They will cause an insuffient balance in your wallet. If they don't cause a insuffient balance both get though as normal txs. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:00:17
Nah. Who cares.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:45:41
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:34:06
The probability of a successful double spend attack doesn't increase when you buy more items. Let's say the probability of a successful double spend is on average 5% (if you have a concret real number, please tell) .... When you buy 2 items and try to double spend it's: 0.05x0.05 + 2x0.95x0.05=0.0025+0.095=0.0975 .. the more you try the less chances there are to be successful everytime on every item: 0.05^n will get lower and lower the more items (variable n) you buy, but it will never reach zero. - Trying double spends are possible but aren't profitable. Do the math. Don't be toxic by being abusive. But it's probably too much to ask.... on the r/Bitcoin subreddit.... 
 EDIT: I edited the formular. It will get more complex the more items you buy.
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:43:23
It doesnt look to me there is so much going on there: 
Anylegit statistic site for lightning?
0-conf is as safe as for big amounts as for small amounts. BCH doesnt suffer from double spend attacks because of the "first seen"-rule. - $10k isnt much when it comes to total transfer value...
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:36:30
So now, You bassically gave proof 0conf is safe enough for large amount purchases. That was the whole point.
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:07:40
He bassically bought some BCH awhile ago. Smart man.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:49:31
Geez. Cryptonize.it and every Merchant which has a MiniPOS system is selling things with  0conf.
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:37:50
It's the problem of the merchant to only send txs to trusted nodes with this MiniPOS. He/She chooses them on there own. It's not like paypal because you can choose as a merchant which nodes you want to pass your customer txs. You have a lot more options. As a customer if you send the double spend to another node which the merchant doesn't accept, only your original tx gets confirmed. Simple. The merchant has no interest to pass txs to potential double spend nodes because it will hurt its business.
I think there are more than 0.5% of miners in the world that "hate" BCH ... why they aren't already do this? Slush Pool could destroy BCH... I think you thinking too easy. In the end it seems to work perfectly at the moment. Nice scaling solution. 
Monero has 0conf as well.
The problem of the selfish mining is discussed heavily at the moment as you know. It is possible that honest miners exclude selfish miners from the process. No chance for SM. This will also reduce double spends getting into the blockchain, because when you send your double spend to a specific node which was excluded, which "supported double spends". You will have no chance that your double spend gets confirmed. I see no problem here.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:26:44


A 5% discount means, you buy 20 items and one of those 20 items is for free. One out of 20 is a double spend. - So you need at least 20 buy orders to be successful the first time.
So even when the amazon card costs only $1k, you'll have to buy at least 20 cards to be successful once and save $1k and you have a discount of 5% on average. Otherwise the probability of a success isn't 5%
The main question is, how do you increase the success rate?
How do you bypass the 'first seen'-rule?
