Thanks! Yes I made it a couple of years back. Finally got around to updating it
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:20:29
Right you are, must have introduced some bug. If you rotate to landscape and back it seems to resolve itself, try that until i can get a fix up :)
*edit* fixed!

Try greasemonkey :)

Still waiting for it...

Estimated amount of bitcoins sent since you opened the page. Basically it's just guessing what transaction outputs are change and deducting them from the transaction total.

It should run indefinitely, if you have any errors in the javascript console please post em (view&gt;developer&gt;show javascript console in chrome)

It's very basic, here's the code:
    amountForTransaction = (tx) -&gt;
      inputAddrs = tx.inputs.map (input) -&gt;
        input.prev_out?.addr
      outputs = tx.out.filter (output) -&gt;
        # discard output as change if output is going to a previous input
        return !(output.addr in inputAddrs)
      switch outputs.length
        when 1
          estimate = outputs[0].value
        when 2
          # most common transaction, assume the bigger of the 2 is change
          estimate = Math.min outputs[0].value, outputs[1].value
          break
        else
          # no idea, just sum everything up
          estimate = outputs.reduce ((prev, current) -&gt; prev + current.value), 0
      total = tx.out.reduce ((prev, current) -&gt; prev + current.value), 0
      return [satoshiToBtc(total), satoshiToBtc(estimate)]

Working on it! This site a bit old and needs some love...
My TODO so far
  * Show estimated money sent during a 10 minute window instead of accumulated since page load
  * Update bitcoin logo
  * Rewrite about page
Suggestions welcome! but keep in mind that this is meant to be a dashboard for a wall mounted display, not a trading analysis tool (no, i won't add a candlestick chart :P)

That sounds about right,  lists that as well. The problem is to know the distribution of those machines...

120Mh/s = 1 watt
that estimate is a couple of months old... it might be a bit lower today with all the new mining hardware

Only 1 of those 6 newspapers has an article about gox.

Awesome! And great choice of website to run on the display! ;)

It's a conspiracy, the government is secretly plotting to save the economy and create jobs by changing the proof-of-work to a manual task that only a human can complete. These 65 poor people are the test subjects.
