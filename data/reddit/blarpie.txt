Keep in mind that's for cellphones though since in Portugal only pretty expensive plans have unlimited mobile data.
That's not the case with home broadband.

By the way is it me or did news go back to censorship days? Been noticing some news that just disappear after a couple of hours.

Well Will is pretty much an insufferable prick i guess that doesn't help.
 i don't watch the show since i dislike it but i guess the 'reddit hate' is sort of like with Rick and Morty, more to piss off die hard fans than hating the show.
