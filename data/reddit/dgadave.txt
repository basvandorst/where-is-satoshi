I don't wish to disclose my address(es) given that my reddit account is very clearly linked to my real world identity.  I assume you can appreciate that.  On the other hand, that also means I'm not an anonymous troll making that claim.  I promise I'm not lying.
The transaction I'm really grumpy about was posted at
2015-07-07 17:xx:xx, was 15yy bytes, and had a fee attached of 0.00015yy BTC.  You'll note that I'm not claiming I did it right - bitcoin core would have probably attached 4x the fee to it and it would have gone through.  But I used Electrum and didn't think about it.  I've since adjusted up my fee, so I assume future outbound Tx's will go through, but 
One I don't mind disclosing, since I'm lost in the noise on it:  I have three outstanding payments *to* me (two from nicehash and one from Poloniex) that haven't confirmed -- here's one such example:
Lots of sources out there that were stuck using .0001 btc/byte.  Yes, this is a good lesson to fix them, but that doesn't reduce the fact that it's causing pain for some people.

Hardly.

blockchain.info is dumping its mempool earlier than other places - the transactions aren't truly disappearing and then re-appearing.  Look at tradeblock for a better view of the actual unconfirmed transaction pool.  (See my post about this here --  )

No - I tried a child-pays-for-parent, not a replace-by-fee.  I'll try a replace-by-fee tomorrow if the c-p-f-p doesn't work.  (In c-p-f-p, you spend one of the outputs of a transaction and attach a high fee to it.  Some pools, such as - I think - Eligius - will use the fee of the child to bump the priority of the parent.  But there've been several Eligius-mined blocks since I tried it, so either I didn't bump up the fee enough or I goofed something.)

This entire debacle introduced me to tradeblock - silver lining! :)

(But more generally, you can find a lot of examples for yourself.  Poke around in blockchain.info at around offset 19000:
Here's a 6BTC transaction that's been in limbo since yesterday:
with a screenshot in case its status changes:
Mine's not that big, thank goodness, but it's still holding me up.)

(a)  This is why average is a misleading statistic; look at median, 90th, and 99th percentile to get a better feel for where and whether the pain is being felt.
(b)  There's a survivor bias at work in that graph:  When you only show the confirmation time for already-confirmed Tx's, you're ignoring the time that has not yet been taken for Tx's that are still waiting in the mempool.  There's a large puddle of transactions stuck behind the spam transactions that are going to experience very long confirmation times once they are confirmed.
(c)  You don't really care about how long the attacker's transactions are taking to confirm.  Looking at an equally weighted average of confirmation times isn't the right statistic.  Not that you can actually do it right without being omniscient, but one could at least remove obviously-dust Tx's from the average if you cared.
(Yes, I'm grumpy about this issue myself.  I have a few hundred US$ in transactions that haven't confirmed yet because I wasn't thinking about it yesterday and let Electrum set its default .0001 BTC/KB fee.  Despite trying to push it through by creating a high-fee child transaction using the change address, hoping that one of the child-pays-for-parent pools would snag it, it's still been stuck there for over 28 hours now.)

That example one finally cleared - but the ones I sent haven't yet.  The tradeblock link for that transaction shows it more clearly than blockinfo:  
    Block              364,546 (11 confs)
    Time Received      8 Jul 2015 12:15 (21 hours ago)
    Size               10,897 B
    Fee/size           11.01220519 sat/B
Block 364,546 was:
    Block Time           9 Jul 2015 07:05 (3 hours ago)
So just under 19h to confirm.  That was a roughly 6BTC payment from Nicehash to ~250 miners, any one of whom might have been annoyed at the lag.
