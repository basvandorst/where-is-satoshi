Personally, I don't think this is it. Sold some off at 8k so I could re-buy around 6500 - 7000.    
I think it's gonna dip one more time and then bust through. We'll see though.

I kind of have the same issue with verifying my debit card with them. I've been through the process 10 times now thinking they'll fix it and they don't.
Verify the 2 dollar amounts they charge my account, type them in exactly as shown, incorrect. Locks me out after 3 tries.
Even called customer support about it and they say they can't help. Just move on to somewhere else.

It wouldn’t be where it is. 
Silk Road is how I learned about Bitcoin ����‍♂️

What a joke. I passed on Coinmama because of the name. It just sounds like some nosey BS.   
And if I had any coin there, I’d be removing it immediately after seeing this thread.

Is this a PC program? Trying to figure out if I should wait until I get home to check it out

Fingers crossed.  
I was getting a little worried for a bit.

Thanks man. You seem like a really nice guy.

Look up the Cash app. You only need an ID to transfer your BTC to another wallet / send it to someone.   
You can buy and sell though. All you need is a debit card linked to a bank account.

We all knew we were going back past 9k.   
That’s why I was calling everyone who wasn’t buying at 7400 morons. It’s like free money.   
I also was lucky enough to short the last 2 dips.   
Cheers everyone.

All of my Bitcoin is in Square Cash. It’s definitely not the most advanced... but I actually like it for the simplicity.

Facts.

I’ve bought $1000 in one shot. About 5k total though.   
The only time it wants me to give ID is if I want to transfer it to another wallet or account.   
The only thing I can think of is maybe our state laws are different? I just found out a couple days ago that you can’t use Cash app for Bitcoin in NY supposedly. I’d contact them and see what the issue is.

Wondering if I should start shorting.

Where in this thread does anyone say they’re doing anything meaningful?   
And what does it have to do with giving money to charity?
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:42:35
I didn’t. It might be because I already have their debit card and everything though.

Coinbase CS is a nightmare to begin with. Buys were disabled on my account randomly. I checked all of the reasons they listed as to why it could have happened in their support FAQ and none of them applied to me.   
I reached out to CS (over a week ago now) and still, I've only recieved generic emails sent by bots telling me that someone is going to contact me about it. If they had 5k of mine locked down, I'd expect to get it back some time in 2025 if at all.   
Sorry this happened to you OP.

When in doubt, do like I do when someone speaks to me in a thick accent I can't understand.
