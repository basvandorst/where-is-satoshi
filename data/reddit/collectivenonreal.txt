Will there still be incentive to mine after LN is implemented?

I paid 107 sat/byte two nights ago and they still haven't confirmed.  Will these ever be confirmed? I looked at the mempool chart but I'm having trouble with the colors.

Ahh, understood. Thanks

Coinbase says bcash is worth 8k?! Won't let me dump them bitches... "can't sell bcash right now"
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:24:37
Still waiting for them to allow bch to be sold...

Not true, look at Elon Musk or Bill Gates. Did they stop working just because they are extremely rich? There are other incentives in life than just money, otherwise rich people would quit the game, but by and large they don't.

How can you tell it's only 1 sell order?

Were you gifting paper wallets or what?

Check out this link:
When the blockchain splits from the upcoming SegWit2x hard fork, it's most likely going to create 2 tokens or coins. They will have a shared history. This is going to happen irrespective of what the exhanges are going to do. Most people's recommendation is going to be to transfer your funds into a wallet that you control(own the private keys). On Coinbase that is not the case, but they have promised support for B2X. However, people are still waiting for Coinbase to give them their BCH Bitcoin Cash from a previous hard fork on Aug 1. Coinbase has stated this is because they are building a secure infrastructure to handle the new token and will grant everyone their BCH in January.

Has anyone actually been paying you in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:57:23
Are they spent on both chains because they orginate from the last sent-to bitcoin address? So there are ways to prevent this and in essence double spend the coins?

Thanks for the help

The answer to that is how much would you be comfortable losing if the exchange was compromised in some way (i.e. through hacking or government shutdown, etc...) Would you be ok losing $100? $1000? I recently got a hardware wallet, and left only around $200 on the exchange for making purchases and etc. Think of the exchange as a small balance checking account and the hardware wallet as your savings. Regardless of your balance, it's worth it to do the research and work IMO. Don't forget that bitcoin is designed to be decentralized, and you act as the bank and are responsible for securing it. Otherwise the exchange has true control over your funds, just like a bank.

Your dad probably understands how gold works, and I think it's a fair comparison as a store of value.  Explaining that it's decentralized and un-seizable could come later.

Do the replay attacks go two ways? Example:
Spend B2X - Can get replayed on BTC fork
Spend BTC - Can get replayed on B2X fork.

That's damn cool. Now I am looking forward to receiving a scam email.

Not sure why my font got bolded and enlarged... lol

Meh, people are excited about it, just deal with it.

 - Coinbase tells you what you are going to pay as you purchase. Fluctuations in price can happen very quickly though. Also realize that there is no "price" really, only what someone is willing to sell at and what someone is willing to buy at (and you must consider the amount of bitcoins at each price level, i.e. liquidity). Every exchange is going to report something a little different in regards to what the market rate is also. 
 - You will receive an equal amount of B2X. 1.7 = 1.7. Coinbase has made this statement:

The thing that sucks about GDAX is you can't lock in your price if you don't already have USD in there. It might be better to pay CB's markup than to wait 4 days for your bank to transfer money into your GDAX account. If BTC keeps going up it would have been worth it paying the premium.

The more power you have, the greater the chance you will solve the math problem that adds the next block on to the end of the block chain and be rewarded with Bitcoin. That being said, home mining without some serious consideration of electricity cost and et cetera, will probably not be profitable. Check out this link, lots of great info:

Amazon comes to mind of course. I would also like to see billpay services like you have with your bank, but that are instant or near instant.

I think the sell limit order is for when you expect the market to rise to your limit price, then the order gets filled and you make a profit. With the stop order, it's setting the price you want to sell at to get out of the market before taking substantial losses if the market dives. I think.

I tried to read the bill, does anyone else have trouble reading these? I feel like technical bitcoin whitepapers are easier.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:05:52
Check out this video, explains the stop order very well.
