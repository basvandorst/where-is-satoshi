No you’re good.  If you have them in a hardware wallet, those addresses are your keys

Not your keys not your coin

In 10 years, will BTC be worth more than 12k or less?  At worst, you lose 1k, at best, you’re a millionaire

Buy a ledger nano x or trezor.

Lol huge $10 dump

That’s awesome!  I’m an RMT in Vancouver and I would love to incorporate this payment option as well but I’m not sure how I’d figure out pricing..  for example $105 currently equals x amount BTC, but say in 4 months time it would be a different amount x BTC as the price fluctuates...  do you know whet I mean?  How did you figure out your pricing in terms of consistency?

Hey I use coinsquare and etransfers.  Pretty quick and painless
@_date: 2018-03-21 02:47:44
Cool thanks for the feedback!  Yes I’m definitely well diversified, but so tempting to pump these coins at these prices
