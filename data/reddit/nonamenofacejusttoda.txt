Call it whatever you want, its been one month. Chill out.

Yeah you've sat here for 6-8 hours spreading FUD today. I hope there's some monetary pay off for you somewhere and it's not that you just have so little going on. ...
edit: excuse me, I meant 11 hours. Literally for 11 hours, you've done nothing else but spread FUD in r/bitcoin. Huzzah for you!
