I was hoping for a, "Asking for a friend" [comment or text from the OP]('I don't want to seem spammy but this seems like it would fit at so here it is')

proof? not a source, proof.

If you just want to learn there is a Bitcoin 101 class at my community college, I don't think it's for credit however

I guess I didn't word it how I was thinking but I was wondering if their (21's) plan is to use these devices to mine many chiains simlutaniously like BankCoin and Btc

I read some site where they claimed that not only did JN invent it (siting him emailing math professors in the 80's and something else about learning to program)
but that John Nash was Nick Szabo.

also, 4 space and a line break will put a lin just under..
e.g. now 2 line breaks
now 4 space and a line

So make it a P2SH payment? Would that work?
@_date: 2015-05-15 03:00:31
interesting, do you have a source for this?
@_date: 2015-05-10 23:05:15
This is a great question.

I've tried to get people to make a bet on this before, it could be fun, I think betmoose allows things like that but no one seemed to use that soite last I was there

Did you read that article here a while back about a paid shill on who tried to show proof that he was a shill
@_date: 2015-05-12 00:30:28
Some people think *he* is really John Nash
Thought to actually be Nick Szabo by many, and Wei Dai as well by some. 
Here are some notable quotations from Nash

"It’s also unnecessary and wasteful of network resources to connect to more than a handful of nodes. " from mastering bitcoin by a.a. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 05:29:52
Why split, why not just do what the majority of the network wants?
@_date: 2015-05-11 18:50:25
But then why say this"It’s also unnecessary and wasteful of network resources to connect to more than a handful of nodes. " it's in mastering bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-02-03 05:33:08
I agree, with all the hashpower and users and companies behind it, why would it drop to zero?
Wouldn't the forked coin with low hashpower and fewer users due to limitations be the one that, arguably, drops to zero?
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:00:04
So restoring bitcoin to it's original functionality without full blocks? Great start running BeU then

Most CS people think 'bits' is a just dumb but also stupid choice. It's already pretty well caught on however. It needs it's own symbol.

Smooth in a situation where there is no planning, but that's not what would really happen now is it?

So why when TPS is brought up is SW always touted as the end all be all solution?

Can it have a list of how many people were shunned and never came back?
@_date: 2016-06-26 01:49:23
y'all should get some of these on there  
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:36:18


I mean, can you prove that in a court of law?     
Because if you can't we're stuck with him as a potential SN or port thereof, no matter how dumb it sounds *to you*. 
And considering there is no way to prove beyond any doubt who SN is, even if SN is willing and wanting to do so; I fear he will always be listed as a candidate. Unless you can fully disprove his claims. 
*edit: downvoting me doesn't make anything I said untrue.

Please do, we have Greg Maxwell saying blocks should always be full and I don't think that's healthy or a good design
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:31:16
If that were all that were happening, perhaps. But let's not pretend what's obviously happening is not happening. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:40:40
This looks just like that, but for different circumstances, I in fact like it more than opendime

Because attacking people's characters is a cowardly thing to do and he is not a coward so he is defending obvious ad-homenin attachs
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:37:08
You Greg Maxwell, never said blocks should always be full, this is a quotation of him saying exactly that.
Cut and Dry, supports always full blocks.
if we were to get into why that is or why it may be useful that's another matter, but the fact remains Greg is for always full blocks. 


I have done this also, in fact it is one of the first things I did coming to bitcoin and it shaped my understanding of what the system was intended to look like in the future. It is fine it that isbn't the direction we are headed but Greg feels dishonest in his approach to explaining that.
The multiple POW quotation is clearly not about blockcsize but about alt blockchains and uses being incorporated, something he was against, bitcoin2.0 
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:37:41
So only 1 person or group of people in the world understand btc? I mean you've always posted some wild stuff but that's pretty out there.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:34:13
It wouldn't be the first time a upvoted and popular post was removed, the reasons were never very clear to me
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:31:59
That's some crazy doublethink. You think you are so correct that no one can dare question you.

[People have been asking for the feature for years]( and IIRC Trezr has the ability, I'd like to see more though
@_date: 2016-10-29 01:03:39
Well let's not be prepared to handle actual use then
@_date: 2016-10-29 00:32:17
*No, it does not* and also your comment does not follow logically from what Greg said. 
Greg said,


You said then that the coins have to be moved. Do you not see how this is an obvious incongruity?
Some of you say that all shitty computers in BFE should get to run a full node and it's okay to cripple the network to do that, but at the same time it's okay to destory thousands of btc becuase you are *forcing* a change that many people *cannot* deal with? It's like you have doublethink going on.
So I think you are saying that the fear this user has, that coins not moved whne you force them to, will be lost. That is a very valid fear and somethig you have no right to decide. 
I also don't see any data, I see Greg saysing he can't be bothered to supply data, but I don't see it. 
Like the comment above you was told, please don't just regurgitate opinions with no data, *show* the data.

Ah I totally forgot about the pubkey txs. So this also means that anyone trying to show evidence of being Satoshi would have to sign not only a very early key but also one after the PHK became standard.
But aren't or weren't all generation transactions doing this?
