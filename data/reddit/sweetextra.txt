What's your opinion that machines will enter in a war with humans as shown in the Matrix trilogy?

How are we getting more transactions when the mempool is never empty?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:17:47
Or he could sell all his BTC for BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:23:49
Nothing changed between $800 and $15000 besides the price.
Obviously the price doesn't depend on anything.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:07:20
Reported for repeating reported.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:57:44
It's science fiction.
You might as well be asking me what would happen if the force was real.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:24:57
Adoption has been falling as the cost of each transaction increases.

"In math we trust"
Why wouldn't it work?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:06
Even if bitcoin did go to a million per coin, the number he is talking about aren't all that high.


Sorry. 50 or even 180 billion isn't all that much in the grand scheme of things.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:50:33
Sorry you grew up to so weak. HODL
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:32:26
People realize there isn't much holding up the price of bitcoin and don't want to see it drop.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:20:41
A true hodl wouldn't be watching the price and wouldn't care much if the price fell to $400.
For them the price will always be higher in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:05:48
I'm sure people would act the same for it if they felt there wasn't much holding it up.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:12:18
How do you do that. Are you going to lock out all coins that haven't moved before a certain date?
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:33:13
All I'm saying is the technology to discover the private keys seems inevitable and not too far in the future.
Once that happens we have two possibilities. People move coins not belonging to them because they can calculate the private keys. Or those coins are removed from the chain and the original owners get nothing.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:11:09
What do you mean only legacy addresses.
If someone figured out how to move all coins created in the first few years of bitcoin but haven't moved that would be enough to destroy it.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:54:24
Is it feasible? Did encryption reach the point of being unbreakable just as bitcoin was created?
It's just a matter of time before it's broken. All the old coins will be waiting for whoever does it first.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:09:31
This assumes you are picking random numbers.
There is a relationship between private and public keys. For now it's not possible to calculate the private key for a public key. At some point in the future, probably long before we get computers fast enough to brute force the private key, we will figure out the math to calculate a private key from a public one.
That will be the day bitcoin truly dies.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:10:00
You can't.
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:14:20
What statements did I make that implied "cryptographic assumptions behind Bitcoin's algorithms are false."
The only thing I stated was that eventually a method will be discovered to calculate the private key. The only assumption I know of is doing that is difficult. Nobody is saying it's impossible. I think most cryptologists will agree it's inevitable that it will become trival.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:43:22
Who told you anything different.
However governments typically make the laws that determine what is legal.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:36:16
Amazon isn't going to hold bitcoin. They will be immediately selling them for dollars. Very few people would be buying bitcoins to spend on amazon.
I don't understand how amazon accepting bitcoins would do anything but put pressure on the price dropping.
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:30:57
Pretend I have 10k bitcoins I mined years ago. Will I still be able to access them after your 'upgrade'?
If I can that means that anyone with the technology to break my private key can access them as well. If I can't then you just erased my coins.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:20:10
Not even close to 1 billion 
Edit: Downvotes for what? Clearly this isn't 18 billion unless those are 3000 dollar bills.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:13:25
They are typically Chinese. China wants the destroy the world but bitcoin is in the way. So bitcoin needs to go.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:16:31
Are you claiming they aren't offering immutability?
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:04:14
I don't think you are reading my comments. You're only responding to what you want me to say.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:59:17
It truly is a miracle if it only gains in value. No need to invest in anything else!
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:00:17
You buy to hold. Who is going to buy to spend. You just lose all the transaction costs.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:47:12
So 0.01% of people buying on amazon with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:52:11
Here the attack is just a method to calculate the private key from the public one.
If you rollback the chain the attackers will just create new transactions and do the same thing again.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:58:11
It's ok to invest in bitcoin at my age.
@_date: 2018-07-13 18:06:14
Loss of those keys is actually bad for bitcoin. It means those bitcoins will remain weak to computational attacks.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:04:42
You are basically saying you only want a system that has a high cost of processing requirement.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:56:08
Who is going to buy bitcoin just to spend?
A lot fewer people then those who are going to just spend what they have (to be sold by amazon).
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:05:00
I'm pretty confident that intelligent beings throughout the universe are using gold as a store of wealth.
Meanwhile only a small fraction of humans on one planet are using bitcoin.
So no, bitcoin is not better than gold on every front.
