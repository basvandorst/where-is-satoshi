It moves the signatures to a new merkel tree, but everything is still validated.    Here's Bram Cohen's (creator of Bittorrent) opinion on it.

The flippening,  derp derp.
Alts act like a spring board to get Bitcoin through resistance levels.  Traders are trading BCH because it moves faster  (no futures, or short selling).   Bitcoin should move through 10k next.

What's not to like ?   It's an new transaction type that fixes malleability and didn't require a hardfork.   It's exactly what the bitcoin protocol needed from the beginning.

Nope,  it's more of the same.  Blocks are barely full as it is.  Hardforking and forcing all nodes to upgrade is not how you build a reliable network that endures the test of time.

Still sounds like utility tokens are a waste of time.  His explanation at the end was just reaching for straws. 
DUber sounds interesting in theory because it's decentralized and you can't fine or shutdown the system. So technically it can match rides anywhere, regardless of regulation, but we're talking about consumers, who typically want to trust or lay blame on a company if something goes wrong.  A dapp doesn't care.

Bitcoin will destroy the Euro, which will cause the collapse of  that inefficient bureaucracy EU.  Good riddance.

I sense a bit of pent up aggression within the bitcoin community.

Bitcoin is constantly being scaled as it's participants are becoming more efficient by using Segwit, batching, LN, payment channels, etc.

Bitcoin Cash is going to be in serious trouble.   Jihan might have to give up on protecting his pet project, to stay competitive in Bitcoin.

Send coins to Wasabi, then run them through coinjoin.  It's pretty easy.

Na, we've been searching for hard money forever, Bitcoin is as hard as it gets.   It's a super massive black hole of value.

Satoshi said that if everyone agrees   (hardfork)  you could change it later.   It requires complete consensus, otherwise the old chain will live on.  
He understood the difficulty of changing bitcoin once the rules were in place.

Or we dump fiat and Bitcoin goes to the moon.
