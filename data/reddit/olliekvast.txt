Not Brazilian but think it says

Don't risk falling behind."

Paraty is amazingly beatiful, I liked it a lot more than Rio. Great to see some Bitcoin enthusiasts make their way over there as well.    
Next hotel at Ilha Grande?

Easy to say when a flight ticket is more than several years salary, also not accounting for visa issues.

What city btc atm are you using rates for?  
15k BRL on most exchanges
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:11:31
Yup, financial institutes normally just tell anyone the amount of transactions the receive...
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:37:50
Do you mean crazy low? Because yeah, $0.21 to get in next block is insane, [source](
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:02:19
Holy crap, that fall down to $87 is coming. Better sell pretty soon!
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:16:31
The change from $1 to $32 is percentually a lot more then for example $1k to $6k.  
Same goes for a crash from $32 to $2 is quite substantual. Whereas a crash from $7.5k to $6k is barely noticable in the grand scheme of things.

He was looking at kids though, hrmm....

Great idea! Hope to see it in every city soon, I am not a host but travel frequently using Airbnb. Will save it for future use!

The lowest fee in Mycelium for me is 0.00226 mBTC or 0.15 USD, how come you didn't choose that one instead?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:23:47
Haha thanks man, I need a cup of coffee!

OP mean first property *in Ibiza*, already specified in another post as well.

I prefer this [site]( which uses logarithmic scale
Each line on the axis is 10 times larger than the one before.
Edit* thanks for the English lesson  :)

If you are developing a slot you should know it is called reels, not slots.  
5 reeles, 6 symbols. All legitimiate slot has 2-8% profit margin, so you are making a scam slot machine.  
Which makes me guess the prize of this contest is a scam as well.

Seems some one fell for it :( [Link]( has several transactions in the $700 range
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:05:53
Newbie question, but is there any guide on how to split your coins?  
Let's say if you had some BTC on Mycelium at the time of the fork, how would you get your BCH from that amount?
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:31:04
Might be unpopular response, but if your budget barely allows you to pay the bills, buying Bitcoin should be the last thing you do.
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:49:15
OH, that makes more sense!
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:45:02
Your $500 investment is worth 19 million?  
That means you got 5500 \~BTC at 10 cents each, somehow I doubt you would be writing that publicly, and if so stop :)
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:34:23


Major asterix on that one, you are not actually buying BTC. But more like a stock tied to the BTC prize. You cannot transfer BTC to anyone else, nor do you have your private seed. It is just meant for short term, low value investments IMO.

Watched it for 5 minutes. 
"Nacho cheese?"
"Nacho Bitcoin!"

Or maybe time for Americans to swap, instead of the rest of the world adjusting.
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:53:29
The first answer seemed very logical and reasonable, but you swear a lot - so I'll go with your advice!
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:09:11
I see Coinbase has it at 15k, but maybe not available in Brazil yet
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:47:03
So they are holding your coins hostage, and if you want some of it. They take the rest, such a scam...

*11 minutes later*  
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:27:53
Damn, that's a rough rate. Hope some other exchanges are available in Brazil
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:43:33
Same here! Majority in Ethereum though, hope it will catch up a bit more one day...
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:39:53
Or 14 months of salary for a Brazilian teacher
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:21:37
I would have recommended them as well, but after 15th of October they are not supporting card usage outside of Europe. Hope they will sort it out though
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:39:53
Seems like a lot more than one word.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:04:54
That would be great, if all places accepted bitcoin payments. I've been using Cryptopay when traveling and it has been working great. So until every store accepts btc payments I guess we're stuck with 2% transaction fees. Just using a card in my country's currency would result in a conversion fee larger than that. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 02:05:58
For the confused people, Brazil's currency is reais (BRL) and 1 btc is right now 8888 BRL. The number 8 is good luck in China I believe as well
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:36:22
you shouldn't say how many btc you are hodling btw
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:05:16
Is that how you think percentages work?
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:12:30
If you have $50 in savings you should not thinking about buying Bitcoin. If you have an income large enough to save, you should should budget for a emergency funds (5-6 months expenses) before you consider "gambling" on something like Bitcoin or stocks, in my opinon. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:41:43
No screenshots when it was below $400 for a year?
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:50:51
I had some funds on there as well, the PDF seems to state to send by email though. Or what address did you post it to?
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:21:47
I am wondering the same thing, just switched to Mycelium couple weeks ago and cannot stand adds. Talk about a short visit...
