Private banks absolutely create money out of thin air just like the Fed. In fact, money created by private banks is responsible for over 95% of the money supply. 
“The principal way in which \[deposits\] are created is through commercial banks making loans: **whenever a bank makes a loan, it creates a deposit in the borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money.** This description of how money is created differs from the story found in **some** economics textbooks.” 
*(Bank of England: Money creation in the modern economy, 2014)*
NOTE: Banks don't 'lend' deposits and they don't 'lend' reserves. Banks create money out of nothing whenever they issue 'loans'.
In the banking industry, the term is LOANS CREATE DEPOSITS.

 "Doesn't the fed pay banks interest on their deposits? "
Starting from October 1, 2008, the **Federal Reserve** Banks pay **interest** on required **reserve** balances and on excess **reserve** balances. ... The **interest** rate on required **reserves** (IORR rate) is determined by the Board and is intended to eliminate effectively the implicit tax that **reserve** requirements used to impose on depository institutions.
