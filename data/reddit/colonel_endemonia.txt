\&gt; I'm very confident I can.
[Are you sure about that?]( You've spent two posts crying, and moaning about anti-fascists beating the shit out of people like you. You seem pretty terrified. It's only getting worse for you, and your ilk, and I welcome it.
Also, Sanders isn't a "communist." , you fascist piece of shit.  Sanders is a social democrat. A socialist would be someone like Stalin, and he would be putting your worthless ass on a train to Siberia.

Sounds like you have a victim complex.

He's a literal white nationalist, and you're providing cover for people that support white nationalists, and slandering people who are defending innocent bystanders from fascists. You're the same type of person who is defending people who influenced people such as the Christchurch shooter and El Paso shooter. I support deplatforming him, completely, and I don't really have any sympathy for a rat like him, or people who support him. I honestly wish Stalin was around to deal with shit-heads like him.

No, he's a white nationalist, and has specifically says he is. I'm not in the mood for your bullshit. I don't give a fuck about your liberal dichotomies of Republicans and Democrats. They aren't important to me, or my analysis here.


They were absolutely necessary. Fascists don't deserve any mercy, and I don't care about your moralizing, or fictitious news spectacles. People like you must be suppressed by any means necessary.


Its not rare at all - people aren't stupid, and are seeing the rise fascist, racist violence. It requires an equally violent, even more, so reaction.


I support dealing with fascist rats by any means necessary. I don't really care how it happens, just as long as there are results. I don't require empathy from you or anyone on this matter.  There's no debating people, like yourself, you must be crushed, and you must liquidated. Its as simple as that. The only question remains - can you stop me?

\&gt; I feel bad for picking on you
But you're not - you're crying about suffering the consequences of being a fascist vermin. It seems like you want to be a victim, and I'm happy to oblige.
\&gt; Are Paypal and the mainstream media and all the other commies
No communist uses Paypal. You must to be a fucking fool. I don't give a fuck about the mainstream media. I'm just hear to gloat about you being absolutely powerless to stop people from suppressing troglodytes  like yourself.
\&gt;the machinery of the state. It's a nasty evil huge killing machine.
I **LOVE** the state for being a useful, killing machine! It's useful for crushing people like you, and its resources can be used to benefit humanity, after all, we see the modern state as being a largely beneficial tool as for protecting its people from threats,and promoting the general welfare of its citizens. The state is **GREAT**! My only problem is the class character of it needs to change so we can really have some amazing stuff happen.
\&gt; Obviously there are degrees of state violence,
Its not state violence though. You can't project violence against people who aren't even human in the first place after all. Its pest control, really.
\&gt; That's just a synonym to try to trick idiots like you. Obviously there are degrees of state violence, but he is well along the path to communism. He supports violently stealing money and "redistributing it fairly" like commies do. He supports state-control of countless industries. (Kinda sounds fascist actually.) He would love everyone to be making roughly the same amount of money, by force. He supports government price fixing.
Socialism, the lower stage of communism, does away with value-form, wage labor, private property and commodity production. Instead of regurgitating garbage you've heard about Marx's theorem from PragerU videos, [why don't get off your lazy ass, and actually read about it sometime. Its very interesting, and life changing stuff - really.](  The things you've listed are transitional demands, and I have no problem with them. The difference being is that Sanders would still keep capitalism in place; whereas people like me would do what Stalin did.
Also, if you're so angry about being taxed - go in live in the woods. You can voluntarily leave this society, and trust me, most of would be happy if you did, permanently.
