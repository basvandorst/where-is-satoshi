Cut them some slack.. They still use potatoes as their currency anyways

I guess the concept is alright, but involving real money into it is something I really dislike.. These kind of games are wayy to easy to cheat and hack , and theres ALWAYS someone that is gonna do it, even if it was only for the luls
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:47:34
no lol

OR.. It might be because OPs English is horrible and people have trouble taking it seriously at a first glance.

those are trades within their exchange. It doesnt let people trade them out atm
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:39:17
Maybe they should... go fund themselves
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:55:39
Is this a joke..?
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:49:52
Because it brings interesting information about the topic. (=&gt; more relevant in case you still don't get it)

Source on not being able to take fiat out of MtGox? I got my euros last month.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:24:18
AFAIK, yes.

this is actually a repost from a couple of days ago.. and they admitted to finding 200k btc (which seemed to have caused this "530k traffic"

I just pointed out the fact that the text had a lot of errors, which might have a big effect on how people view and (down)vote the post.
Formatting and layout plays a very big role when it comes to first impressions.

I'm pretty sure *"The recent trend of nothing in nothing out"* is just something made up on this subreddit.. 
People (me included) have withdrawn fiat within the last month (1k€ in my case)
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:19:34
big dump. they should release an update in about an hour
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:46:43
Keep in mind that it isn't necessarily a profit in the long run, the other party that is trading you expects gox to come through and give him the BTC back later. For a much much bigger profit.

to be fair, the value is bound directly to the market consensus "belief", so technically these "made up numbers" are estimates of how the consensus will change. It's not like its "completely random". ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Why are you so angry?
Sometimes there are no reasonable numbers you can use for realistic calculations and estimates, or the calculations are too sensitive to changes in some of the variables. Then you're better off basing your estimates on your gut feeling.
For instance, you're probably familiar with how drastically small changes in the discount rate can change your results? And if you're trying to crunch numbers and calculate a price for bitcoin the discount rate is the least of your worries..
I'm not saying the OPs estimate makes sense, only that your attack on it makes just as little.

same thought crossed my mind with my 2000€ in btc :s

A week ago I had a transaction go through in less than 10 minutes without the fee.
