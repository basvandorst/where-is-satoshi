I think i spot him, the rich dude living in a hilltop. He used the word fork twice, he looks very rebellious too.

Why so much panic over anticipated price correction? You know how many crypto analysts already anticipated a 8k -10k price before a couple of weeks? Some even went to 5k. i am honestly happy to visit the reddit bitcoin section and see all these panic memes, keep selling guys give space for true investors.

The last quarter had seen almost all assets going down, including silver, gold, oil, real state, fiat, crypto. Bitcoin &amp; oil are still in + from a yearly perspective.

You are thinking right but what you are missing is that most of those million plus merchants don't have the patience nor the time to do what me and u think is very simple. You will be shocked that today i as a merchant, get many emails from customers saying its complicated to PAY using coinbase, comments from first world customers even though coinbase is really the most simple ui/ux in crypto business. Customers get further confused when they see lightning, its like another layer of complication for them.

What is venzuelans first choice when converting fiat to crypto? How do normal people approach it? What are the fees?

From my experience selling with PP &amp; Crypto same time, any crypto payments will mean an actual HODL. If you are in a state where you need cash fast never keep crypto unless when u see market crash (like now) i just enabled crypto again. I keep enable / disable based on price. Also, better use litecoin / eth if transactions are average 50-100$. Lightning will be good for BTC its just bad that markets are bear else its top technology.

I think you are poorly judging here, this is literally just a way for them to get customers buy bitcoins from them, there is no catch for you as a merchant, am using it and its working fine so far.
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:29:25
You can turn off BitCoin Cash and only accept bitcoin litecoin or whatever u decide.

lol you don't need to go far, his daughter herself said he was heartless. I found that shocking since most daughters actually love and appreciate fathers more than moms. He must have been too ignorant. If he couldn't be good to his family i doubt he would be good to friends.

For the last bitcoin vs a possible cryptic gold standard competition, i think gold standard wins ONLY IF INTRODUCED now while bitcoin adoption is still too low worldwide. Bitcoin wins if more millennials adopt it faster and on a larger scale. It will be scary for bitcoin if all governments agree on cryptic gold but considering how current money printing works, bitcoin is more favorable for the next phase \(At least 10 years\) and then cryptic gold will be the final phase. Never forget bitcoin is code and code proved o always be vulnerable, thank you for this upload.

Yes future contracts will make things way easier and it is in fact more beneficial for banks &amp; co to get regulated. They act like not happy but they definitely are in for the BTC. They need that BTC has arising transactions, more wallets created daily, more daily adoption. Forget the price, its the demand that is annoying them, they can't risk watching while people turn crypto even if current numbers are still humble.

Some extra thing i noticed, plans depend on your country, when you create a user add your location first. It will tell you if you can opt-in to a specific plan. Seems EU users can get access to any plan while other locations will depend.

There is a similar thing to revolut you might want to try it called cashaa, its been there for some time but just recently they've released their banking platform, you can get current account, deposit and exchange fiat-crypto check it out.

I've left 20% for those like you or lost bitcoins or satoshi nakamoto or whatever. They don't need to own more than 80%, if they own 80% that is enough to consider BTC as their product.

The orange water caps though lol

Even it sends us up, bankers &amp; co. considering that BTC is a national threat to them will get green light to further print &amp; buy. Time can stretch yes but in the long run, there can't seem to be a single way to stop them from buying. Like tell me 1 scenario where they can't own 80% of the market? Miners mine to sell, exchanges exchange to sell, hodlers hodl to sell, all roads lead to sell. Note I've left 20% as positive figure that such amount will always be reserved by some for whatever reasons.
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:22:56
It is good point that banks compete yes, but it is still healthy competition for them since they know they are washing away a potential threat for all of them. And again be it 1 or many banks, they are going to own BTC to trade it and continue making money out of it so doesn't matter if 1 or many competing money priniting banks.
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:25:21
It doesn't matter really. Banks or Devs or anyone can own BTC in multiple small wallets or big wallets. These numbers can't proof who owns what but yes you are not making things any better lol.
@_date: 2018-12-29 12:02:59
Fair questions but i think all depends on your way of using. Here are some thoughts:
1- Not sure i understand, financial history or u mean assets? Each of these crypto banks offer different security measures, as of cashaa it has multisig wallet which is not comfortable for normal user but more secure and preferable on business level backed by bank of england, most legit companies will prefer this. Also no need to full go one path, separate the assets.
2- Washing etc... also depends on the each crypto bank KYC/AML.
3- Employers will pay u direct as individual yes so u dont need such banks, but for individuals they work better as international money transfer method. Always remember many places in the world lack basic banking services.
4- Again depends on if you are a user or a business, for such crypto banks their clients will be either individual or business. Individuals use such as money transfer, quick exchange. Those offer debit card might help those pay groceries but its a personal choice not critical matter.

They don't need to own 80% in a year. They are in for the medium term. It can be 5-10 years which by then BTC will have more wallets, more adoption &amp; they will make sure to see their ROI.

That doesn't proof anything. More wallets with lesser amount of BTC in 99% of them doesn't proof what you are trying to imply. Note BTC wallets generation is in a massive high [ You can't proof who owns what exactly and that is the worrying part not that 1% has value and others don't.
