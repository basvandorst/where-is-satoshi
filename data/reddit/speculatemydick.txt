My concern isn't the current trade value but more of what will happen to Mt.Gox. Could the USG go after the site and shut it down? Could I potentially have my money seized? Should I be attempting to switch to a different Exchange?

I agree. I'm waiting for the 50-60 range. I'll buy at that and sell. I'd love to talk to you privately for some insight if you're up for it.

Kid, I think you completely misunderstood what I'm asking. I'm not worried about the value dropping. I'm concerned that the USG might seize or shutdown the mtgox domain.

I agree. I don't think the loss will be too drastic as long as I can buy at the right price. I feel like speculating on bitcoins is an educated guess at best but my thought is that since bitcoin has barely reached mainstream, there are plenty more high valuations and crashes to come.
I'd like to buy low, sell for a few thousand dollars profit and just keep repeating while never reusing the earnings I make that way if I do make a bad bet, and I will eventually, at the very least, I will have made a bit of profit and paid off some bills but not lost the initial money I came in with. That's a win to me.

Thanks Mike. I agree completely.

I'm not a huge fan of speculating myself because it seems like there are two types of really successful speculators, niche market experts and guys that love to visualize data and make decisions off of the charts and data they see. 
I'm more of a let me throw in a few thousand once it hit's $50, I've seen it rise and fall between 50-100 for a while so I'll sell around 80-90 and make a good profit then wait for it to fall again.
It's a guess at best but it would still be pretty effective until your barber talks about his investment in BTC, then you'll want to pull out faster than a guy banging a downlow chick without a condom.
