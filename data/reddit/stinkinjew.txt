Huh, I used to purchase computer equipment from a guy three states away. He would include a deposit slip with the paperwork and I would make the deposit at a branch in my town instead of mailing him the check.

What about digital products or professional services that do not need to be physically imported to China. How do they pay accountants and lawyers here in the US, for example?

As a Dad myself, it is knee-jerk reaction to protect you from yourself, from something he does not feel comfortable with or knowledgeable about. Remember, this is the guy who made it his job to teach you much of what you know.
Prove you're a real grownup. Do the research and present a pro/con case to him. And don't paper over the cons! Remember, your frame of reference and his are totally different. He probably not as internet savvy, uses cell phone only for calls and the occasional text to you.
You can use this as an opportunity to show dad how independent, savvy and mature you've become.

No, there is not a "specific event." There are probably a lot of events coming together at the same time.

Does it make any difference if you use a capital "B"??? If I use a lower case "b" to spell Bitcoin in this text entry box, it wants to autocorrect to "bit coin." If I use a capital "B" it accepts the word as-is.

All merchants are not going to be converting to fiat immediately.
There are far more small business than big boys. I believe many small business owners will take in Bitcoins, transfer them to a personal account as part of their paycheck, and hold them as a personal investment.

You need to get out more… I'm a stinkin Jew and I personally visited three banks Friday, cause yeah, I'm a stinkin Jew and I got many bank accounts.
More to the point, In each of these banks I had to tell my White Anglo Saxon Protestant bankers about Bitcoin. Not one of these schmucks (that's a Yiddish term) had even heard about Bitcoin!
My basic spiel was "You remember what Napster did to the music industry? You know what the web has done to newspaper publishing? Well you need to read up on Bitcoin."
So yeah, don't try and tell me about the Jewish bankster conspiracy to control Bitcoins, bubba.

While I was lighting candles and singing Hava Nagila, I had a thought… 
Your "Major banks and liberal media organizations" are generally publicly traded on Wall Street. Actually, I would bet that the US military retirement system; police, firefighter, nurse, teacher and other public employee retirement systems are the real owners of those "Major banks and liberal media organizations." Maybe you could get them to dump all their stinkin Jew controlled investments?
Do you have a 401k bubba? I bet YOU are an owner! Maybe you need to start a shareholder petition to your 401k to have them divest from any stinkin Jew controlled holdings. Let me know how that goes.

I just got off a conference call with "The Leadership" who blessed my experimental investments with crypto currency. They said even if I failed personally, The Worldwide Jew Mob® would benefit from my experience and we would be one step closer to Total World Domination and the perpetual enslavement of anyone with the last name "Jones."
I learned to think for myself right after they cut off the tip of my dick.

From Wikipedia:






Maybe stinkin Jews simply value hard work, higher education, and truly believe in the scientific method, unlike the Tea Party neanderthals. Or, wait for it… maybe we REALLY ARE the Chosen People! Wouldn't that be a hoot!
Sorry, I got to get back to my stinkin Jew buddies who are eating gefilte fish, drinking Manischewitz and watching the price of BTC drop until we can spend some more of that stinkin Jew gelt. What are you doing tonight, bubba?

So, do you and other bankers ever talk about crypto currency? I asked my banker what he thought of bit coin a couple weeks ago and got a blank stare.

If they can't/won't/don't divulge all fees in advance, you agree on $2500 but receive only $2475, isn't this technically a criminal act? It seems like theft to me.

You also missed the dot com boom, the discovery of oil in Pennsylvania, the invention of transistors and many more. You could have bought Apple, Google or Amazon shares. The point is, spend less than you make and invest something, somewhere, for your future. 
1) Pay off high interest loans
2) Build a 3-month emergency fund
3) Start a 401k

Mealy-mouthed, wishy-washy Wall Street CYA BS as they slowly build their own positions in BTC… There will not be "good" or "bad" Wall Street projections on Bitcoin until Wall Street is positioned to profit from their reports. And elephants move slowly.

OK, put $1000 in your bank today. One year later, you can remove $1000 from your bank. But you can't buy the same amount of bread, gas, etc. with it. That's inflation at work. Your dollars are safe in a bank, your buying power is not.

No, your saying "Jews control the banking industry" is small-minded, racist, hate-mongering of the worst sort. Jews generally try to be happy and live life for today. I'm so sorry that you are being held down by your own bile.

Where do you think all the money flowing in to bit coins now is coming from? It is leaving "the legacy banking system." People who are dissatisfied with the current banking system are more willing to diversify into bitcoins.

China is not 'Merica's friend. They have sent us infant milk laced with melamine and toxic dog treats, not to mention a metric shit ton of lead-laced kids' toys. China does not want to be under 'Merica's thumb, currency-wise. So yeah, they would be more than happy to see Bitcoin begin to edge out USD as a global currency. But remember, they think very long-term, decades.

Remind him that he missed out on the dot com boom and he doesn't want to make the same mistake twice.
As for you, son, please keep in mind that Pops has a different timeline about investing than you do. He is at an age where he just does not have a lot of time to make up any losses. You have a full earning life ahead, so you can afford more risk. Plus, Pops is probably still paying for your ungrateful ass' health insurance.
Final advice, be a good boy and give him a hug. Start small and use this as an opportunity to hang out together and learn something new, together. Priceless.
