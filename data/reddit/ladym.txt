You should always be concerned when someone calls you an idiot, especially when it concerns how you handle money. Please, use this time to reflect.

Capitalism is not about saving or consuming capital, but rather about allocating capital; those who do well at allocating capital are the people responsible for much of everything that you and I have.
The fundamental principle of capitalism is the observation that capital is best allocated by the one who—through voluntary interaction—created that capital in the first place (rather than by, say, the bureaucrat who takes said capital by decree), ***but that doesn't imply any inherent virtue in hoarding***, and so this whole discussion is completely beside the point.




Where have I suggested anything about rights (or lack thereof)?
Anyway, I think you've gotten lost in the conversation. The same problems with hoarding and dumping apply to any other commodity, including stocks.

Nope. [People need to eat]( real-world needs must be met.
Nobody asks about the causes of a deflationary period, anyway. After the initial investment in a new currency (i.e., after any hint of a bubble has dissipated and the currency becomes stable), a deflationary period for a deflationary currency pretty much means that there is an increase in the productivity of an economy (say, for example, electricity all of a sudden becomes much cheaper).
So what if there are fewer hours worked and less money passed around. Prices will have decreased, offsetting any perceived loss; everybody holding that currency has gained, after all. More to the point, the deflationary period will end, and spending will resume in order to find better investments than just saving.

You seem to suffer from the delusion that wealth is magically being created by decree. At best, it is stolen through counterfeit.

If that were to happen, then the value of the money wouldn't continue to increase, and so people would spend it in trying to find a better investment than just saving. Moreover, the necessities of life differ from person to person.
Now, I've repeated myself several times, so I intend to leave it at this comment.

The alternative is pretty much only an inflationary currency. So, look at the other side: Someone owes me $123 (2013 dollars), but today that only has the buying power of $73 (2008 dollars).
There's nothing special about these two situations. Deflation and/or inflation must be built into the loan agreement if it's that much of a problem. Specify a stable measure, such as 2008 USD.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:21:40


I didn't state that, and it's certainly not true in the short term.
What people don't realize is that the free market is not about immediate solutions. It's about the evolution of a solution over time, *even if nobody realizes that a solution is emerging*.
Evolution requires variation and selection—that is, the free market; the government, by its very nature, crushes this process.


Nobody is better at caring about externalities than property owners; when nobody personally owns a thing, there are few who care for it passionately.
Externalities would be much better handled under a system with a much stronger sense of 'private' ownership.

However, speculative hoarding is not an economy.

Not if that much wealth has been poured into it; those hoarders will demand that services take bitcoin as payment.

The same motive that compels a person to buy a hamburger rather than just hang onto the money: The investment is projected to produce even greater gains than would be produced by any current deflationary trend.

Could you explain that further, please?
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:22:16
No, it's possible to make a quick grab of a lot of property using the currently perceived value of bitcoins, only for the sellers of said property to find that the bitcoins they received aren't worth as much as they thought in the end.
This is arbitrage; it's making use of the fact that the market being attacked has not accounted for the coins that have been hoarded, so the value of the hoarded coins is essentially counterfeit.
In this way, such an entity could transfer a great deal of real-world wealth to itself. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:26:16


And in your own special way, you will be helping to lower the value when you do start spending.
Once people start spending hoards, the value of bitcoin will drop. Hoarding creates a situation in which inflation is possible; in essence, this is because the value of these hoarded bitcoins is counterfeit by virtue of the fact that they have not been accounted for in the economy.
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:57:31


Exchanging bitcoin for anything else is fundamentally 'cashing out'; it can drive up BTC prices, hurting the buying power of those late to the game.


Some probably are, though the accumulative effect of hoarders dumping may be just as worrisome for those late to the game. Inflation is still a real concern, though not quite as open ended as with, say, the Federal Reserve system.
@_date: 2013-03-25 01:56:45
You can transfer coins between 2 addresses that you own; is that circulation? No. It's hoarding.
Its very difficult to tell from the blockchain alone exactly what's going on.

That is a stupid question, and a straw man argument.
During a period of significant deflation:
* I would sell hamburgers to build up my savings, and then buy a car in the future at a significantly reduced price.
* If I ***really*** need that car now, then I must be willing pay the significant overhead of being a better investment for the bank than saving (or some other investment); "I would kill for a hamburger right now".
* etc.
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:02:32


This makes no sense. Were you trying to transfer the coins to the control of another private key? Why would you do that?
Why wouldn't you just get a copy of your private key? You just deleted the private key without even asking others about this first? It makes no sense...
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:40:02


At that point, people would be buying fractions of a bitcoin...

What about the people who casually sifted creeks for gold? It's the same thing; the resource in question wasn't scarce back then.
Value isn't determined by hard work; if it were, you could make a killing digging ditches and then filling them back up again.

It's also pretty damn expensive overhead from the numbers I've seen.

Erm, that is definitely a logical fallacy. Both sellers and buyers determine it *together* based on real-world needs.

Not coins. Value.
That's why dumping a hoard has the same effect as inflating the supply.

* America as a whole is incomparable to other countries; those other countries could at most serve as models for individual American *states*, and even that's unlikely given the relatively heterogeneous communities within each state.
* The American system is the result of crony capitalism, a Frankenstein of governmental protectionism and corporate greed; it's not a reflection of the free market, but rather of the abuse of government's power.
    While France's socialism *might* produce lower costs than America's fascism, nothing could compete with a truly free market, where services could only exist by virtue of their inherent sustainability.
* In particular, France's governmental system *might* have out-competed and "utterly dominated" the "private" sector, but that's only because France's government has one advantage that the private sector does not: **The threat of violence**, which is not an acceptable foundation for a civilized society.

The thing is, that paper money stems from a history of real world value. Bitcoins also offer real world value in terms of the mathematical and computational infrastructure that surrounds them.
So, it's never simply the case that a commodity has value due to a grand, collective delusion. A commodity has value because it serves a real world purpose.
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:12:00
You can't have your cake and eat it, too; you can't whine about a decrease in currency units being spent while also acknowledging an increase in purchasing power per unit of currency (or the fact that a deflationary period will end).
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:04:26
You're being confused by the number "51%".
You're neglecting the real possibility of hoarding and dumping, which would cause a massive depreciation in the value of the hoarded commodity (bitcoins), and thus massive price inflation; in other words, inflation is still possible with bitcoins, but it's not so open-ended as with, say, the Federal Reserve system's money.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:52:10


Then let the government prove it by competing in the market place, as per any normal business that must engage in a **voluntary** exchange with customers.
... or are you saying that government handles some services better because the government gives itself an artificial advantage by **involuntary** threat of violence?

If a node in a pool is doing 90% of the computing, then it's essentially solo mining. Besides, the point is that the current incarnation of the bitcoin system is flawed if it's not worthwhile for a great many more people to contribute decentralized computing power.
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:41:42
However, propagating transactions depends on the client choosing to connect with nodes other than the trusted node from which the client received the transaction propagation.
It seems like a safer bet for growing the network would be to control mining by decentralizing that computation.

That's the problem with taxes. Your opinion is not someone else's.
The whole point of the **price mechanism** (i.e., the 'invisible hand', i.e., evolution by variation and selection) is to account for the complexities of the world without requiring the impossible task of central planning (i.e., intelligent design).
Taxation is a complete bastardization of this process, which is why it's a constant problem.

My understanding is that running a client contributes in that it decentralizes the copy of the blockchain, but it does not necessarily (or practically) contribute to the calculation of new blocks beyond verifying integration.
I suppose, at the very least, contributing to a mining pool would ensure very small transaction fees in the future.

Hence: "in other words, inflation is still possible with bitcoins, but it's not so open-ended as with, say, the Federal Reserve system's money."


He didn't earn the perceived value. That's the whole point; the coins acquired earlier were not as valuable as the coins acquired later. Spending those earlier coins as though they are later coins is counterfeiting value. That's why central bankers want a low level of inflation: To keep that kind of arbitrage from being as damaging.
The decentralized solution is competing commodities (i.e., competing currencies).
