You can. The simplest way is to use  -- you buy SLL (second life lindens) with a CC and then convert them to BTC.
The cheapest way is to use liqpay to deposit USD into either the btc-e.com or bitcoin-24.com bitcoin exchanges.
Liqpay is a sort of paypal like service that you link your credit card too. It's based in the ukraine and their site isn't very well translated into english.. it does however work with credit cards from anywhere in he world.
There are some instructions here for using it with bitcoin-24;
btc-e.com works the same way.. you just need to ask their support for the deposit number and then you set your username as the reference the same as with bitcoin-24.com
The hardest part of this process is probably linking your creditcard to liqpay. It's not that hard really, but the bad translation and the way it verifies your card make it a bit tricky..
Basically to verify that you own the card, they will authorize a small payment to the card. They don't bill it though.. just authorize, so it reduces your available credit. You then have to enter the amount that your credit was reduced into their verification form so that they know it's your card. 
If your online banking/credit card site allows you to see realtime available credit you can check the amount before and after the verification and the difference is the number you enter in their form. If you can't, you'll need to call your credit card support line and ask them to tell you how much liqpay has authorized on your card.

heh ok. I haven't really considered btcquick seriously as I thought it was too expensive.. looking now though, it's around 8% over mtgox which is probably comparable with the virwox method.. to be fair I don't really use that either. :p
liqpay into btc-e is a really good way though.. only 1% fees, it's cost competitive with most options for getting BTC other than EU SEPA transfers and dwolla.
