The two major players at the moment are [SecondMarket]( who have launched a Bitcoin Trust, and the Winklevoss twins, who have applied to create an ETF, but are still a long ways away from getting SEC approval.

I think if there is a goal here, it would be to make Bitcoin feel more like a spendable currency (like cash) rather than a commodity (like gold). 
There's no problem with gold being valued at thousands of dollars per ounce, because you don't buy a pizza with 0.01 ounces of gold. But you CAN buy a Pizza with ฿0.02330. For BTC to be as easy as cash, it needs values that are easy to understand – and that seems to be a challenge to Bitcoin's adoption as currency.
On top of all the other stuff you need to learn about Bitcoin to understand it, people are used to seeing "coins" as a nearly indivisible unit of currency, so there is a natural barrier to comprehension inherent in the name.
The "Satoshi" is the closest thing there is so a "dollar" or "penny", but it is much too small at the moment to be useful. That Pizza would cost 2.3 million Satoshis?
But I guess we won't really have this type of nomenclature nailed down until the value of a Bitcoin stabilizes to a point where it can really be useful as a currency. Let's all hope "Satoshi" becomes a household name soon.

"PayPal hasn't figured out how to charge 3% fees on Bitcoin transactions, so I don't think it's a currency."

Seriously David, your book is pretty bad as far as books go. Most people consider a "book" as a carefully-crafted body of work that has gone through rigorous editing and peer review prior to publishing. Your e-booklet (as it's more accurately described on Amazon) is a far cry from that level of polish or perspective.
If you stopped labeling this piece as a " bestselling book" then you probably wouldn't encounter so much "seething outrage". 
But then you wouldn't get as much attention on Reddit...
