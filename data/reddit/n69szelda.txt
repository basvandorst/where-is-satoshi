Ill go check it out. But the truth is that no one would take something called "PPcoin" seriously.

... a $15 fee for wiring over money??? NOPE.

wow netbook mining? I wouldnt have imaged that to be all that profitable but I guess back in 2010 it was much easier. Good for you having a place to stay. Not sure why you were downvoted.

Quitting is for quitters
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:39:39
Can you explain? It seems like that would be a good thing to click. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:46:35
It is funny because the IRS would have no idea where to start

jesus. I am very jealous.

And if you inversely flip the one axis and then place it on a logarithmic scale of time...
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:48:04
$10,000K or $10k ($10,000)  
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:34:21
wow.. but how? That is so much/
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:53:32
It might have to do with uncertainty in prices but I truly dont see a reason not to account for the fact that 1 btc ~ $135.00
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:22:27
Possibly some big players wanting to distribute there holdings?

If you tipped it to his twitter and then the coin was deposited to the astronauts personal bitcoin wallet (because I am sure he could just download the wallet software on one of the spare computers)

Its just like any other good though. Lets say I buy a product using paypal and I receive the product. Then I run off and destroy or sell the product and then reverse the paypal. I still just ran off with the product. Bitcoins are no different. There is a certain level of trust in every transaction. That is why ebay and certain things have buyer/seller ratings and credit cards have "credit."   Cash for cash is great but if I am doing a bank transfer I do not see any reason that I shouldnt be able to get my bitcoins. I would much prefer an online paper trail at first (that I can then encrypt myself.)

bets of bitcoin. Its really easy to just go and throw around a few BTC. There arent a whole bunch of good bets though currently.
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:59:55
True but we dont buy things in pounds of gold. We have coins. Bitcoins is a bit different. We are limited to trading in a single denomination, Bitcoin, and so the decimals will be there until we standardize making listings in mBC or bitcents.

Nerd communities, girlsgonebitcoin, and drug dealers getting in on their bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:15:11
Can someon please explain the gist of a "paper wallet?" 
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:19:00
you have too much money :/ ... I would buy maybe 20
@_date: 2013-03-23 02:35:11
be prepared for high fees.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:41:56
Sadly even with cash I find I end up paying quite a bit of fees :(  It isnt bad now because the price rises enough to make up for it. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:15:11
And for those who are curious, 


Is the  search.... 
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:18:48
I dont know if I have any money :( but... 
+bitcointip $.50 verify
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:18:13
but... if it crashes at 130% You are going to be really losing out. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 09:54:46
Considering I have a bet placed that it will reach $150 before April 21st, I am really rooting for this.
@_date: 2013-04-07 10:27:52
149.50.. it was so close. I am actually not quite sure of the terms of the bet. But if it closes above 150 it would mean more bitcoins for me!
@_date: 2013-03-19 19:13:49
As someone who sold/spent all of his bitcoins a few months ago.. i am NOT happy. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:21:40
Really? I saw a segment on CNN where they did this in california. I am sure there was a loop hole somewhere.
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:21:48

perhaps you could send me a picture of the finished product? Also - how long of a lifespan wood you say this will have? I almost want to buy it just as a gesture because it is cool. I have a bit of bitcoin to spare.

FTL communication certainly does violate causality even if FTL travel, or instantaneous quantum entanglement does exist.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:17:12
I just dont see it. People do not like dealing with extremely small fractions. I suppose we could then do all of our dealings in milliBitcoins ... It is just a thing of practicality. People dont want to work all there life to own one bitcoin. I dont see it. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:46:01
I got a 5 cent one once! It was awesome! It was the first thing that got me interested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:45:32
Is it possible to limit accounts to just a few trades per minute or some type of limiting device like that? I am not exactly sure how much the trade of bitcoin is like trading into stocks but it is necessary to stop spamming while the servers are not adapted.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:54:29
My dad was doubting the legitimacy of btc but after telling him about betting and now porn he gave me money to buy him a btc.
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:20:36
Oh wow. I am very sorry to hear this. Where do you get the 24,000 BTC number from?
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:37:14
I would LOVE to buy a grinder from you as I actually need a new one. But I would need some claims as too the quality of this. It just seems like it wouldnt work that well. Also - with no pollen catcher it is a bit expensive for any practical use. Do you have plans to make one of slightly higher quality with the bitcoin logo? Or can you discuss how well it actually works?
