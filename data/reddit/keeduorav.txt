I think the main problem is that we don't have sufficient materials in Estonian language that promote, explain and instruct business owners how to adapt and what are the advantages of using cryptocurrencys.
Our media and even our national bank thinks this is some kind of pyramid scheme and that shows how little they know and how much they have spent their time researching. 
I would recommend starting a blog for starter and start translating materials that explain how cryptocurrencies work (in Layman's terms of course) and then move on providing materials how to adapt them. For that I need people who want to help me and if this works out well we can think and act further.

That's sweet, and not a single publication mentioned it, interesting.

Oh yea, I faced the same issue, had to do withdrawal in two different days and paid ridiculous fee and had to do it from a teller and from a ATM as well.

Where do I begin...
Banks in here made net profit of 444 000 000€ last year and they didn't pay any  income tax here (Except LHV). But they tax us for every freaking move and your salary must be paid out to bank account.
I had to close my debit card two times in a month, because they discovered a reading device from a ATM and after I got my new debit card they discovered a virus from a pet shop card terminal.
Now thanks to SEPA all transactions take time like they are using retarded pigeons for transfers. 
Today I read that now when you want to buy a car under 5k€ you have to pay more to banks.
I have more "fun" stories about interactions with banks but I don't want to agitate myself more right now :)
