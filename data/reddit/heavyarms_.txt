Hello, I've had a day off so decided to sit down for a whole afternoon and get my head around crypto. After scanning various resources, including the original paper by Satoshi, and additional commentaries on his C++ *(I am not a programmer)* I was wondering if someone could explain to me, hopefully in layman's terms, if^why I am wrong in thinking that eventual value of^(*the sum total of circulating*) BTC will equate with the ongoing cost^(*presumably electricity and maintaining related mining infrastructure*) of maintaining the ledger. I'm sorry, I just don't see where the value-added is coming from here. 
Please understand I am not being aggressive, it's just a sticking point in my mind I am hoping someone can help me with :) Thank you &lt;3

Correct. I'm still digesting tbh so thinking is still fluid, however, I am presently thinking of this thing as a stock, since for all intents and purposes^(*especially for all those people calling themselves 'investors'*) it presently functions more like a stock than a currency. In this use-case, the dividend^(*reason to mine*) seems both fixed and trending-towards-zero; and the value... well, that second thing I'm failing to understand, beyond the discounted expected future returns... which again, are trending towards zero.
EDIT: not zero, but the value of "mining"/ maintaining the integrity of the blockchain as per OP. Sorry.

Sorry, to qualify, I have valued businesses as part of my work. That valuation method is common for non-listed companies without a comparative listed alternative. It's called Discounted Cashflow *(or DCF)* and seems relevant to me in the case of BTC. Again, more than happy to be explained I am wrong.
