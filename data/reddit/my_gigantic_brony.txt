Sure no problem......
It's not like I'm rich but I did get into bitcoin when you could just run a program on your computer and get some. I bought more to buy drugs at some point. 
I really should have cashed our when it was 20k.

I have this problem. It's a good problem to have imo.

This was actually made illegal in the united states. You are now allowed to offer cash discounts and have credit card minimums no matter what.

I'm on mobile but if my memory serves me correctly it was part of the Dodd-Frank wall street reform and consumer protection act.
There is a chance that I am wrong and that it is not a federal law but I am certain that it is the law in New York State.
I will try and remember to look into it later.

At least where I live this is no longer true (as a matter of fact it is mandated that you are allowed to give a cash discount).

All that I am saying is that their is a reason to eat the CC fees for a retailer (increased revenue). The same motivation doesn't exist at this point for bitcoin.

I personally disagree. I've been involved with bitcoin since early 2012 and  I have always thought that trying to use bitcoin like a credit card was a little misguided.
I think of bitcoin as a means to store value in the internet connected world. If I had to draw a comparison from bitcoin to something more traditional I think the commodity market (in particular precious metals) is probably the best comparison. 
When you compare bitcoin to gold it has some clear advantages and disadvantages. When you consider cash / credit cards / debit cards vs bitcoin I feel like it's comparing apples to oranges.

Obviously customers end up paying for everything, that's how businesses work. My point was that the merchant fees might not be literally reflected in the price (e.g. 2% increase because of them). Sometimes costs can be offset in other ways (e.g. more customers or larger sales). I would argue that most of the time merchant fees end up being offset by increased revenue without the vendor needing to raise their prices.
This is fundamentally different from bitcoin fees because they are charged to the person transferring the bitcoins.

I don't doubt it but they are few and far between. For the average business the difference in revenue is enough to make up for the slightly lower profit margins.

I don't know if that's a good way to look at it. 
Most places don't offer a discount for paying cash and places that accept credit cards are not necessarily more expensive than places that don't. 
I've also seen plenty of places start accepting credit cards without increasing their prices. 
As a merchant you can justify this because accepting credit cards increase your revenue. Even if you are making slightly less money per transaction it still ends up being a net positive.
Additionally, plenty of merchant fees are way less than 2%. Our fees average ~.5% and a big chunk of them are 0.25% (mostly for debit cards). This obviously varies based on your type of business and the types of cards you accept.
I don't see it as a cost that necessarily gets directly passed onto the consumer, unlike bitcoin fees.

I don't think I said that. I think bitcoin holds tons of value, I just don't think it's a replacement for credit cards.
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:02:37
To be fair, credit and debit cards do have fees, they are just paid for by the vendors.

How much does 1 BTC ~ equal in USD right now?
edit: for you - how much usd will you get for a btc if you were to cash it in right now.

It's an idiom. Deal with it, you know they meant.
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:32:03
Hi i'm extremely lazy and want to donate some money to you without using bitcoins. Can you link me a way to do so?
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:46:49
I did. People say it all the time and you know what they mean - which is exactly how idioms form. It is perfectly fine for idiom's to be nonsensical or be slightly modified version of another idiom. Language changes, deal with it.  Lots of phrases have changed (to the point where they don't make sense) because they were misheard / repeated incorrectly.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:40:27
At least I can understand how bitcoins are created. I'm not sure anyone really understands how USD is created.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:02:56
Why does what other people say bother you? I would honestly think someone was a huge asshole if I saw them correct someone over this in conversation. People make much worse linguistic mistakes all the time, but why should you care in a casual context assuming you understand what they mean?

Congrats on breaking the donation record twice in 24 hrs!

All the miners are running full nodes.

That's very different. It would be more analogous to correct someone who says me instead of I - something you shouldn't do just to be polite. If people are spouting off fase statements and you kniw better go ahead and correct them. If people misuse language and you still understand them it makes you kind of obnoxious if you correct them.

If you really believe in bitcoin, then now is probably still a great time to invest.
