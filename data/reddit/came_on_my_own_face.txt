This dude should be in jail. But no, he's now spending all his time drinking Starbucks and creating new businesses even though he owes a lot of people several hundreds of millions of dollars. This is a disgrace.

This is called arbitrage. It is hard to do because it will cost you withdrawal fees etc.

I like how you are suddenly holding the bar so high for them when their service is acting superbly so far (in comparison to other exchanges). But yes, the industry needs to change its way to try and prevent another goxxing.

I would be pretty satisfied if he jumped from a building in Japan. He just acts like a smug little fuck that took on responsibility for stuff he had no right getting involved with. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:47:09
Yeah, works fine for me. OP must be doing it wrong.

I am so surprised that there aren't more reactions like this. That fat idiot joking around like this when he has stolen the money of a lot of people, most of which aren't millionaires. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:59:54
Um. He sent a photo of his cat sleeping on his desk to the IRC room; that's exactly what I am already claiming. Stop trying to twist my words. I said he "posted" and posted to an IRC room is inclusive in that statement.

That was actually pretty funny. gg Conan.

I didn't call him an idiot. I called him an "idiot CEO", and he is certainly that unless you can prove that MTGOX is doing better as a company than when he started.

The dude in question had sent them $25000 and been involved with a $4000 scam before. I see no reason to think that Chase is targetting bitcoin in particular. They are targeting extremely risky accounts, like those owned by that guy.

Why is there a 15 minute countdown on the payment page? What happens if your payment confirms after this time?

Fair? Fuck that. If he was planning on selling an exchange shortly after creating it, he should never have made it.

Ironic that the only good news coming to gox victims is that of ethical hackers, because the target organisation is even worse than their attackers.

Maybe you clicked upgrade your account instead? Click to buy tokens and there is a btc option.

Nah, man. Karpeles doesn't give a crap. He's going to avoid any legal repercussions and has been paying himself wages all this time, so prob has enough to fund starbucks for the rest of his long life. Unless you are implying he commits calorie-suicide, which it looks like he already has.

That is irrelevant to what is being discussed. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:19:17
Cmon man, let's be serious. Shooting a nailgun into Karpeles is just going to be a flesh wound. You won't even hit any internal organs, as his fat will just absorb the impact.

"There are a lot of people who are daytrading, buying high, selling low." - so.......... you're claiming that the newcomers are selling low and then the daytraders are buying their cheap coins? Welcome to an economy. Don't want to lose out? Don't sell low.

Hmm.. for an idiot CEO that allowed deposits up until the day they died and was never transparent about their problems, I daresay people disagree with you. Even if you show logic (which i don't believe you do), that doesn't stop people wanting to assault the guy. An assault charge would be a small price to pay when people are down up to millions of dollars mostly due to him.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:55:25
Have a small reddit community come up with 400 million dollars to fund a number of people who are missing coins, that would be very tricky to confirm the legitimacy of. All to cover up the mistakes of a failed company that has shown signs of dodginess over the entirety of its life. Sorry, but no.

I don't think you understand how many millions of dollars are involved in this. Also, their customers can take it up with Karpeles, the guy who stole from them.

"we ought to assume they haven't." - That's exactly what the message says. They haven't done one but "The company plans to start publishing" in the future.

I am at work and this made me LOL. Very witty, OP. 
Also, this deserves more upvotes. Hopefully people get the reference. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:58:37
I actually agree with you but i think i said that wrong. " the target organisation is even worse than their attackers." AKA the target organisation (mtgox) is even worse than their attackers (the good ethical hackers). 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:53:14

Clearly you haven't done much research. On the BTC-E frontpage: "3. At BTC-e we are constantly monitoring Bitcoin accounts and FIAT reserves. At BTC-e we continue to maintain all clients’ assets in full – both Bitcoin and FIAT." and then "1. BTC-е is at its peak of financial strength with the record levels of clients and capital adequacy. The company plans to start publishing financial statements, verified by an external audit, on a regular basis.".

I believe Antonopolous made a joke that apparently fiat was vulnerable to the transaction malleability (obviously a big joke/scam).

I would actually like to see Karpeles played by Timmy, personally. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 08:37:05
Remember when Roger ver put his reputation I the line to personally say that mtgox was going to be ok in the end and that they weren't having any money problems? Think about the victims that believed this moron.

It's a downside for Karpeles because it's 2mil less he has to fill himself with Starbucks drinks.

Yes, that's the reference. Thanks captain obvious.

It brings tears to my eyes to see someone calling me by such a prestigious name. Thank you, kind sir.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:43:46
So after admitting that the price goes down after you buy, you convey that you're going to keep buying despite this. Right.


No, you actually lost over $600 per coin. The value of BTC would need to increase 400% for you to re-make all the fiat that you just lost. 


Losing money is actually a good thing, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:24:53
No, it means the problem is that no one wants to use it and it isn't gaining much traction.
