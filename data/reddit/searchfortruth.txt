So stop saying it has nothing to do with scaling.  8GB blocks gives ~8000x the number of transactions every 10 minutes.  Why don't you stick to arguing about whether it's the best strategy for scaling up instead.
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:12:09
Let's see with 2MB blocks we can do 2x the number of transactions every 10 minutes on average compared with what is possible right now.  I'm not saying that there aren't better methods or methods that can be used in conjunction with this, but I've seen a number of comments say that BIP101 has nothing to do with scaling and that is just plain wrong.

Open Transactions will bring a lot to the table for exchanges and things like changetip.  Should allow for efficient microtransactions and reduce counterparty risk (with voting pools).  However, user will have to manage their own keys in this scenario - so that's an area where user friendliness will suffer.
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:06:19
I would add Open Transactions to that list.  I see a lot of promise there, I just hope they can deliver.

You realize how early it is for bitcoin when looking at the comments.  Almost universally completely negative.  Maybe it means the upside is still tremendous if adoption continues.

How is it then possible for my blockchain wallet to only use my private key for access without even knowing my address?
- public address is derivable from private key.
What would hinder me in trying out hundreds of thousands of random private keys, adding them all to my blockchain wallet? 
- nothing is stopping you.
It can't be that hard to stumble over a few wallets that way?
- it's very unlikely but give it a shot and report back pls.

Nothing is 100% foolproof unfortunately but I think breadwallet is certainly one of the best solutions currently out there.  It's definitely the most idiot proof (although I still have friends who never wrote down their phrase and then wiped their phone, or forgot the pin they used when they setup the wallet - ugh - but they were drinking when they set it up so there's that).  The safest system I can think of is rolling dice, computing private keys with a clean offline system and then storing encrypted paper wallets in multiple locations.

Here's an interesting read - I definitely enjoyed the article:
I do believe we are in super adoption/growth phase.  If bitcoin gets as big as gold, then it will probably have similar volatility to what gold has today.  That's I guess still pretty volatile but probably much less than what we see with bitcoin today because liquidity is so much higher with gold right now.  But the article presents the view that volatility right now is not a bad thing and is to be expected.
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:34:47
Yes - HD wallets require a single seed to be backed up.  Non-HD wallets require a backup every time a new private key has been generated.  But this is different from needing paper wallets - you keep savings/large amounts offline to prevent yourself from being hacked.
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:04:36
Yes.  Import is probably faster.  But note that you are still a bit at risk of malware at the point of upload and transfer (for example - somebody swipes the private key and quickly sends funds faster than you can - or somebody replaces their public addresses in memory that you are sending to).  The better solution would be to import the private key to an offline computer and then sign a transaction which is then uploaded to an online computer and broadcast to the network.  I haven't worked out the process for that though (maybe look into armory or electrum).

Network effect will likely make bitcoin the winner (among with a couple of others) and then a long tail of smaller ones.  It's just a strategy to hedge against the unlikely but possible scenario that bitcoin stumbles.  But is right that investing in good infrastructure companies also helps because they can pivot easily to different cryptocurrencies.  However, these companies are all early stage and it's hard to tell who will be a winner (and get access to them).  So maybe a combination of cryptocurrencies and startups - that would be a good way to play the space.  And then maybe add some mining of alts if it makes sense (bitcoin is probably quite difficult to do unless you have some sort of edge).

And I'm not sure why this isn't mentioned more often but you are out of luck if your own account is hacked (no insurance there).  They only insure if THEY are the ones at fault for losing coins.  So for example, phishing can screw you even with 2FA.  Hijacking session cookies can screw you even with 2FA sometimes.  There are still many ways to lose your coins this way.  IMO best solution for newbies right now is breadwallet.

Unfortunately so far, it looks like Western Union is still cheaper.  I did a calculation on WU which charges no fees for debit card based transfer at an exchange rate of 43.68 pesos/dollar.
Right now you can buy on coinbase for $889.40 and sell on buybitcoin.ph for P37,714.53.  This works out to an exchange rate of 42.34 pesos/dollar.
But hopefully people will be able to use bitcoins directly in the philippines after some time.  I guess they need a version of bitpay/coinbase merchant services.

1. STATE REGULATIONS seem to be stifling innovation.  For example, Virginia state stifled one of the best ways to buy and sell bitcoins - tangible cryptography.
2. IRS AND CAPITAL GAINS - I believe that the IRS should carefully consider that spending bitcoin (as opposed to converting back to US Dollars) should be EXEMPT from capital gains tax.  This is very important for allowing the US to be at the forefront of bitcoin adoption.  There are other countries that have adopted this stance and they will be the ones that will foster innovation in this space.
@_date: 2014-07-30 06:01:56
One possibility is open transaction servers backed by bitcoin voting pools.  
@_date: 2014-08-26 14:56:25
I don't think this helps.  Locking actually involves selling bitcoin under the covers anyways the moment you lock it (for the other asset).  So, it's pretty much the same thing.

I believe this is a distinct possibility.  Somebody calculated the current fee as around $4 per transaction at the moment if you include the mining reward.  There is also the tragedy of the commons where nobody will want to pay the higher fees even though they know they should.  This might mean the network is not secured by enough hashing power.  This is a known problem but I don't think a really clear solution has emerged.  Proof of stake has been proposed as one way around this issue.

I believe that info is stored in the keychain and that this does not get deleted if the app is deleted.  To wipe the seed phrase you need to actually wipe it from within the app.  This should be made clearer.

@_date: 2014-07-08 16:58:31
The main benefit of bitcoin at the moment is anti-censorship.  The good news is that is a pretty big benefit in and of itself.  People have been using cheap payments/microtransactions as part of the sales pitch but those  as you can see have technical problems.  The fee is also pretty low right now because miners currently earn a high block reward (inflation).  Running a decentralized database will always be much more expensive than running a centralized database.  It's inherent.  But there is hope that some layers can be built on top of bitcoin to support cheap microtransactions.  These might be off-chain centralized or maybe something in between like open transactions.  One bright side is that this is an open ecosystem that is fostering innovation - so there will hopefully be incentive for somebody to solve this problem.  But the system will have to evolve and change a lot to bring about many of these hoped for benefits.  Hopefully we can grow enough before things get too expensive to give time for these other solutions to be built and deployed.
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:47:12

They are probably factoring in the current "inflationary" mining reward of 25 btc per block.

Here's an interesting approach for breadwallet cold storage.  Create a new breadwallet wallet and write the seed phrase down on paper and store it somewhere safe (preferably in 2 locations).  Transfer the funds to your breadwallet.  Then use the breadwallet "reset wallet" feature to wipe the seed from the iphone.  (Don't just delete the breadwallet app as the seed phrase will still reside in the keychain - this is something that needs to be made clearer for breadwallet users).  Now you have a very simple cold storage solution.

@_date: 2014-12-18 02:56:08
I believe that Trezor is a HD wallet -    From the one seed phrase it can generate an infinite number of addresses.  To prevent address reuse, whenever you send coins to a target address, the "change" or remaining coins from the inputs are sent to a newly generated address in your Trezor.  All of these addresses are yours and your Trezor knows how to access them all because they are all generated from your initial seed.  So nothing to worry about.  And no need to reward anybody.  You already have access.

@_date: 2014-07-08 21:55:04
breadwallet has one special seed phrase you should write down.  All private keys are derived from that seed so it's the only thing you need to save which makes it very convenient (an HD wallet - hierarchical deterministic I think).  Other wallets allow you to generate new private/public key pairs and in this case, you need to continually make sure your backups include the latest generated keys (a pain).

Here are some use cases I see that apply today (which admittedly don't currently really appeal to the average Joe):
- New type of hedging asset in your portfolio.  This is similar to allocating a percentage of your portfolio to gold.  You believe bitcoin adds diversification with upside.
- Hedging against your sucky local currency.  You live in Argentina for example and are trying to protect against inflation.
- Escaping capital controls.  You are protecting assets from seizure or need a way to move assets out of your country.
- Paying online for fringe services.  Maybe dark markets, but maybe also gambling sites and porn sites (where you don't trust them for subscription credit card orders or want more privacy).
The ones that might be on the rise currently are:  remittances and microtransactions.
One thing that makes me optimistic that we will see more and more use cases is that a lot more innovation will probably occur on the cryptocurrency rails than the bank money rails.  So things we can't even imagine yet will be made, and many problems we currently have will be solved.  I think we will see great strides in fundamental issues like scalability, privacy, security and ease of use in the next few years.  And then a lot of cool ideas leveraging this.  So you need to currently look at bitcoin with an eye to the future.  Looking at it as if bitcoin is all it ever will be is IMO very short sighted.

Your last step with the blockchain wallet reduces your security by a ton.  I have downloaded both the bitaddress.org pages and the bitcoinpaperwallet.com pages and use them to cross validate the private keys generating the appropriate public keys.

@_date: 2016-03-03 19:28:06
Perhaps it would be better if the rift persisted.  Competition within bitcoin may actually be a very good thing.  Competition drives innovation and makes things happen much faster than if there were no competition.  This whole idea of "consensus" and "dangerous hard forks" alongside the added censorship and ddos is trying to stifle competition and have a single unified front.  I understand the sentiment behind this but I think it has turned out to be dangerous - stagnating in fact.  Let's break things wide open, have competing teams, see if bitcoin can survive hard forks.  Else, if bitcoin stagnates, it will surely be overtaken by something more nimble.

My feeling is that mastercoin is trying to shoehorn something where it doesn't fit well.  Ethereum has promise.  I have no idea what the Bitshares people are talking about (but maybe that is good).  Will one of these (or something else like it) replace bitcoin and devalue it?  Hmmm.. let me look into my crystal ball.  Just a second....
I'm imagining a world where DACs are quite common - maybe in 2 - 3 years.  There are distributed marketplaces to buy drugs that the feds cannot really shut down.  There are distributed gambling sites for all sorts of gambling that the feds cannot really shut down.  We are interacting with these with some cryptocurrency - is this cryptocurrency bitcoin?  I have no fricking clue.  Sorry - it's foggy.

You're probably right, but I'd love to see let's say 5%.  That would be about 30x higher than where we are now.  I think cryptos are a good complement to gold (they each have advantages over the other).  The thing I worry about the most is whether some other crypto completely unseats bitcoin.

I have been struggling with the ETH and ETC derivation paths for Jaxx to import into Coinomi.  Various places say M/44'/60'/0'/0 and M/44'/61'/0'/0 but this only brings up a fraction of the transactions and coins.  I've also tried M/44'/60'/0'/0/X where X is 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.. to no avail.  Any insight?  (Trying to extract transaction history data - jaxx won't let you export it).

Really?  In my experience, projects that have devolved into the paralysis of core have usually been completely leapfrogged by a separate team/product.  People seem to say core is driven by consensus - but what does that mean?  100% agreement from some set of developers?  If that's the rule for getting a change into core, no significant change will ever be able to be made to core.  Software by committee with 100% agreement just does not seem like it can accomplish anything.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:15:25

does a great job cutting through the issues. Adam is not assuming every user transacts with every other. His n squared  comes from looking at cost over all nodes or system wide costs. He agrees per node costs are order n.  
@_date: 2015-09-19 22:22:18
Here is where and agree n squared is system wide and order n is per node. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 20:47:00
Shouldn't the last calculation be: each validating node verifies n*a transactions where a = average number of transactions per user. Since there are n/100 nodes the total work is a*n*n/100.  But I agree the right thing to look at is per node cost which is simply a*n. If this is where this O(n^2) idea (adding work across nodes) comes from it is disingenuous.  
Let's say a piece of software presented a sorted list of users at startup for every user that was currently running the software. Would that sort be considered O(nlogn) or O(n*n*logn)?  To me this software scales according to the former.

Miners have to get paid somehow - the current hope is that transaction fees will provide enough payment.  Inflation can be seen as a "holding" fee.  So one way to look at this problem is to ask who should bear the burden of supporting the network - transactors or holders? Somebody needs to pay.

So be careful till these malleability issues are resolved.

It's a problem that goes beyond bitpay unfortunately.  IMO a flaw with bitcoin that should be addressed.

No - I don't think so.  It is safe to send multiple times TO a bitcoin address.  However, it is better to send only once FROM any bitcoin address and no longer use that address afterwards.  So you should be fine.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:36:30
I think reading the discussions linked to off the wiki are a good start - I'm still going through them myself.  But my cursory understanding is that miners would still accept transactions with fees that are too low to support the network because the marginal gain by accepting is positive.  Users then would not pay enough fees to support the miners because even though they know that mining is critical, they can get away in their individual case with paying a low fee since a miner will include the transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:53:47
See about half way down on this page.  
Essentially if you have an address that has never spent there are two levels of encryption that need to be broken. With a spent address one of these is lost.

Absolutely - if he was on android and possibly subject to this bug, I agree with you 100%.  The impression I got from the post was that he was not worried about the android bug issue per se but by a more general comment he read in the thread.  Perhaps I misunderstood.
I was addressing the general notion that it is more secure to only spend once from a bitcoin address if possible ("In the comments, somebody remarked that the safest thing to do is to never use the same address twice.").
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:25:18
Try to imagine a huge drop in the value of your bitcoin (like maybe 50%).  If you will at all be tempted to sell at that point, then that amount is too much.  Keep reducing until you can sleep at night and continue to hold.
Are you young?  Can you make back that money with earnings easily over the next few years?  Or is this like a year before retirement and you will need that money to survive?  If you are young and your savings are low relative to your earnings, you can invest a lot more percentage wise.

Nothing more to it than writing down or printing out your private key on a piece of paper.  You could also have a QR code that makes it easy to upload online.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:21:16
And the amount of miners left may have a hashrate that is too low to reflect what is necessary to protect the network.
Edit: BTW - I'm not saying that bitcoin is clearly doomed.  I'm saying that if nothing is changed at all, there seems to be a problem with bitcoin as it is currently coded.  Clearly, there will be a lot of brainpower dedicated to solving this problem.  But I just wanted to point out that many very smart people DO see this as a problem and are looking for an answer.
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:32:42
I think for many reasons address reuse is being discouraged. So as you say change should always go to a new address. Right now many wallet implementations don't make this easy. The new dark wallet will encourage this. Also hierarchical keys will make this easier to manage (like in electrum).

Regarding 2FA and blockchain.info:  From my understanding, if somebody gets access to a wallet backup, 2FA will not help you.  They can then brute force the password.  2FA only
helps limit access to the online version of the wallet.
Does your email where the backup was stored have 2FA?
Also, if you can find any clues on whether your email was compromised (gmail
for example I think has some logs on access), that would be helpful in understanding
what happened here.

This is just a hope.  There is a problem called tragedy of the commons that theoretically may occur.

The last tab of the bitaddress.org program lets you type in a private key and then generate the corresponding bitcoin address.

Here are some things that keep me up at night.
Bitcoin wealth is too concentrated.  Somebody posted a statistic about 2/3 of bitcoin in 13000 addresses recently.  ASICs also mean that a lot of coin and wealth gets concentrated into the hands of the ASIC makers.  Much of this wealth is also in the hands of people who stole to acquire their bitcoin unfortunately.
Bitcoin's projected security is still speculative.  Nobody knows how things will evolve when the mining reward diminishes and transaction fees become the main source of income for miners.  Everyone always says that bitcoin code can evolve but will it evolve quickly enough to keep competition at bay, even with the network effect?
Bitcoin's anonymity is not very good at the moment and it is not clear that the current coding efforts will solve this problem.  This is a big problem for fungibility.
Bitcoin's scalability seems very iffy and it is not clear that the current coding efforts will solve this problem.
Bitcoin appears to be using a lot of computing power.

Yes - check out bitpay or coinbase for guaranteed exchange to exact amount of dollars you want to charge, with lower fees than a credit card, and possibly faster deposit of funds.  Besides the integration and training costs, there really is no downside.  Now you may not get much traffic for now, but you might get some free advertising, and traffic may build in the future.  You also might be able to more easily accept international payments without worrying about fraud since bitcoin transactions are irreversible (this may not apply).  Also, if you want to speculate on bitcoin, bitpay and coinbase should give you an option to keep whatever percentage you want in bitcoin.
As a customer, I may have a lot of appreciated bitcoin that I would like to spend.  I also may not want to reveal my personal details and I find the ease of using bitcoin (at least for online purchases), is superior to credit cards.  I also may be purchasing internationally where some merchants may give discounts for bitcoin (or eventually not even accept credit cards) because of the savings generated from not having to deal with fraud.

I would say buy and wait several years and deal with the consequences.  It might be zero due to fundamental flaw, inability to scale, competing cryptocurrency, government interference.  It might be 10x-10,000x higher due to its usefulness as a store of value and ability to facilitate transactions.  I doubt it will be anywhere in between.  When I do the odds in my head, the expected value is VERY high, but with pretty significant risk of being zero.
The thing I remind myself is that if bitcoin is eventually viewed as little as 1% of gold's utility as a store of value, its value will HAVE to be much higher to accomodate the required liquidity.  I read today somewhere that the current price movement makes people nervous because we have never witnessed anything like this before (gold and silver's rise having been established before recorded history began).

Good thoughts.  I'm interested in how other countries deal with the tax for individuals on exchange for goods and services.
