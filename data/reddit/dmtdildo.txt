He should pay if he doesn't want to be a big asshole liar.

Bummer man. JK, HST has made me question my own goals and life many-a-time. Could full dedicated insanity actually prevail? maybe lol

Really dude? also, bitcoin \_puzzler, really dude? This sub is so toxic, please try to not make us all look like kids. This kind of hostile bickering is sad negativity to the this sub and ones like it. Please keep discussion and opinions meaningful and relevant or .... even.... constructive. Crazy concept where we all might actually learn things though meaningful conversation instead, without some guy making fun of someone mom they're never met. Jeeze Loius.

Are you a bot? You didn't even read my comment, again thanks for reminding me why I hate posting on this subreddit.
let me break it down for you in 2 parts..
1. I like bitcoin and crypto
2. Most of the people (this is you) posting on reddit about crypto are stupidly defensive/aggressive for no reason. Thanks for telling me about gold and stuff, literally everything you said is out of context of the conversation and offers no content or value. Every time i dip my toes in here its like listening to a drunk in a bar repeat the same bullshit but doesn't actually listen to anything. Every time I post here I regret it. Re-read the context of this conversation and look inward if you're actually not a bot.
