You can't do anything about it, it's called free markets. This is especially a unregulated market, so all you can do is whine because it is not illegal to pump and dump when the government has no jurisdiction on these markets yet. Not everyone has to buy your idea. You just sound like someone who got burned in the market. When you invest in any idea or asset, you should know the risk that comes with it.

Agreed, it is pure fantasy. When will it pop though?

This is how it starts, a range of excuses to build hope, and then when it starts going down more, you'll all start complaining the market is rigged.

There is no tangible backing to it.

Bitcoin the branded coin sucks because the underlying processing speed lags behind even the slowest payment tech, it has no future. Blockchain itself has a huge future. The value of Bitcoin eventually will be nothing, future blockchain tech will undoubtedly be worth much more than Bitcoin. Gold has a use like manufacturing hardware or even jewelery.  The use of Bitcoin will diminish when people realize a better ledger/blockchain tech comes out. İt's inevitable. Look at ripple. A majority of you Bitcoin "investors" haven't invested ever. Sure, you can learn with the information on the web, but you need to learn about your own behavioral triggers and market dynamics to know Bitcoin is going no where. İt's not to bash on the idea of crypto, but being first when your tech sucks means nothing. Who cares if Bitcoin is first to market when you've got alternative cryptos that process better. Cash out while you're green and you'll be happier when this loses all it's implied value.

See what happens when just one new cryptocurrency enters the market? Watch what happens when a ton more begin to enter. Boom.

There is a girl I work with whom kept pushing me to get into Bitcoin. I then saw her go to another co worker and do the same. Then I realized she did the same thing with 20+ people. She basically was trying to convince people to buying the coin, and really she's sales pitching the currency, when it really has nothing practical to offer. This fact doesn't mean blockchain is doomed or won't become the way of the future. It's just that current cryptocurrencies are all speculative, and it will just keep going down. 
I don't want to hear a rebuttal of well stocks are speculative too. They're not, you actually own shares in a business where you can measure cashflow to determine whether the amount of X you give to finance(i.e. keep this business going) will net you &gt;X. 
i.e. Adobe, Facebook, Activision. These are companies that take public money via shares, use that money to produce a product that eventually consumers spend money on. That money consumers spend will eventually be distributed to the people who risked money. 
CRYPTO DOESN'T HAVE THAT.

I mean, yeh, they're praising the technology, not bitcoin itself. Don't you realize what will happen when and if the federal reserve creates a USD cryptocurrency? It will diminish any value bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies hold because people will primarily use the USD. Have you thought about this, just a genuine question. Not being snarky.
