This is true, you don't want your coins so secure that even you can't get them. If you are going to keep them unencrypted, I suggest printing the details of each address with Bitaddress.org. Just go to wallet details and input each key (from an offline computer) and store them in a safe bolted to your slab for optimal security.
Always good to print a couple copies just in case and leave a digital backup on a usb.
You could also place the keys in an encrypted drive with the password to decrypt it being a multisig private key that is unlocked by 2 out of 3 shares. Then you have an encrypted backup that can be recovered in the event of your death. Give each share and a copy of the backup with instructions to a lawyer and a family member, keep one for yourself.

I have asked him on Google+, no comment. I thought about what his response might be and I think he would agree secretly but I also think he would be wise from making financial predictions since he is looked at as an oracle and people would blindly follow his prediction even if it turned out to not come true.  If anything, I think he would endorse cryptocurrency technology as a whole with bitcoin being the leader of the pack. That way if bitcoin doesn't work out his prediction is still true if something like ethereum or one of the alt coins succeed.

I have been thinking, and NY should be able to have any rules that they want to play by. However, there should be exemptions for everyone else. If you are exempt you can display an image on your site showing that you are exempt and not covered under NY rules or Jurisdictions. If you are compliant, you can proudly display that image as well. If you are neither compliant nor exempt, you would not display any image related to NYDFS compliance at all and carry on with business as usual and consumers would take their chances on websites that do not show the compliance logo. If scammers are using the image of compliance customers should be able to check their serial number on the image to a database on NYDFS site to verify they are compliant. If not go kick their door in for being scammers and fraudsters. Lets not enforce crazy regulations on the entire global population, that is completely out of NYDFS jurisdiction.

Counterparty is interesting because they are paving a new way, yet Dogeparty comes along and it actually makes sense to use it because dogecoin is so cheap to buy and transact, it's faster and more efficient by far when you are sending to large amounts of people. Except counterparty is still in development and dogeparty hasn't implemented all of those features yet.
Colored Coins are great and seem to be just as good as counterparty now with being able to issue multiple dividends with a single fee and cheaper to create new assets. The drawback is that they don't have a decentralized exchange, or any exchange (that I know of) where you can sell them on a live market. 
It just depends on what you are trying to do. Most people don't have interest or a reason to issue a new asset other than just experimenting or toying around and most companies that would issue stock already do that in a traditional way.

I can tell you why the price just went up a little in the last few minutes. 
I got tired of some guy 1 upping my bid by a penny. Every time I listed my buy order he would 1 up me again. So I set the price to 657.11 on bitstamp, just below the 657.15 bid, effectively taking out all volatility in the market.  stayed there for a few minutes and sure enough he went to 657.12, so I went to 156.14. If he wanted to 1 up me this time he had to buy a sell order at 657.15 and push the price up. He never did and I held this price for about 6 more minutes. Just when my small coin wall was eaten through, the other guy matching me hodled his price and then it seems to have influence a 200 coin order. 
This was fun! I got to set the price on bitcoin for a few minutes with buying as little as 5 coins and subsequently set off a chain of events that caused an alert to go off on my phone from the price increase. Small world.
Moral to the story: If you want the price to go up you have to pay for it. Try it out, it's kind of fun.

That's true, but we can't create a new blockchain everytime someone has a good idea and expect to be taken seriously. Monero is a nice experiment like other alt coins that do the same thing. The goal is to implement as much security and functionality on top of the native bitcoin protocol to make it compatible with existing infrastructure. It's no good if you have to sell your precious bitcoins for monero to use it.

Hey, thanks for striving to get it right! Bitcoin is a very diverse field so it's hard to know these small details in every little niche. The comparison made is how I feel too, it's like the core belief of the whole marketplace. Silk Road is to napster as openbazaar is to bitcoin. I think the goal is to make the open market so easy and commonplace that it becomes almost as good as a human right. If everyone is trading everything with everyone, maybe the regulators can focus on real terrorist threats instead of a guy ordering a bag of weed.

He was (resigned this morning) the CEO of moolah, a company operating in the Dogecoin space. It says he was picked up for questioning, however that is not an arrestable offense in my country unless the questioning determines you committed a crime. It seems the questioning would be related to fraudulent activity involving investor and customer funds. Also, his identity has been exposed as being one of many generated by a known scammer in the space. Not big on Doge either, but that's what I gathered from my readings. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on any of this.

Yea, even if you do venture capital you should still buy actual bitcoins too and not just the companies dealing with them. When you buy bitcoin, the value of bitcoin is increased for everyone in the community. When you put that money into venture capital you expand and make the community better. Win-Win either way.

I wasn't able to log in on the official site but my phone works fine. Normally I would be reluctant to give out my info for my blockchain.info account but it is retired now and only has a watch only address with a balance.
Edit: Okay I got my blockchain working, libratax works if you export your transactions from blockchain and import into libratax. Also it's more secure this way. I was able to export everything except from BTC-E it makes me imput manually.

Merchant adoption can drive price down because when most people spend bitcoin they don't buy it back immediately to replace the holdings. Most merchants just dump the bitcoin on the market as soon as you spend it to prevent volatility so you might as well just sell it on an exchange and drive the price down.
The flip side is that the more merchants adopt bitcoin the more consumers will (hopefully). So, it evens itself out, I guess.

Absolutely, nothing is free. However I imagine the incentive would be the same as when merchants offer cash back, a fee. And POS hardware does not necessarily need to be upgraded, for example if the store already uses bitcoin as a payment option or if the store utilizes a standard online shopping cart supported by the "bitcoin back" provider. Even if not, implementing bitcoin payments for some retailers can be as simple as purchasing a $50 walmart tablet. Just as not everyone offers cash back retailers would have the option of not implementing bitcoin back either. It would be great if the option existed though for merchants that wanted the extra revenue/profit flow.

Just keep it running, you are running a full node that helps keep the network healthy :) Make sure your ports are forwarded or it will be pointless. You should generate all your addresses on a computer that isn't online and won't go back online for cold storage. You can then scan qr codes to your hot wallet as needed. The cold storage is your bank account and your mobile phone wallet will be your hot wallet where you carry spending cash.

You can use the private key of a multisig as the password to an encrypted drive with the contents as your wallet seed(s). You can then distribute the backups of the drive along with 1 multisig share each to a lawyer, a family member, and keep one in a safe. Any funds held on addresses generated from the seeds in the backup will be recoverable in the event of your death.

Thanks for the tip! I agree, I actually divide my stash up. I keep most in cold storage and then what I have in my hot wallets are divided between trusted locations such as blockchain.info, coinbase. I actually trust coinbase to hold a little btc since i have to trust them to buy it in the first place plus they keep most their reserves offline and not a 1 man karples operation.

Some people like the have a little bit laying around in a more obvious spot to set off flags if it is moved. This way you can have time to take steps to protect your larger hot wallet in the event of an attack.

Anonymous money with an open market will take the red tape out of the equation completely. Capitalism and the free market will reign again.

Seems about right. So what if It wasn't keys, but the password for your encrypted wallet? Would you trust that? On that note of hiding in plain sight, wouldn't it be better to rename your wallet to something like icon.jpg (wherever you store it) just so there's not an advertisement to brute force wallet if found, who attacks a corrupted jpeg?
Edit: I'm not advocating throwing caution to the wind, just asking. To me, I'm paranoid about storing my keys/encrypted wallet in conventional locations because that's where someone would look. if my home gets robbed they would probably take the lock box i have and that's less secure than my email method i think.

This is a moot issue other than they should allow opt-out. That issue I do agree with since some people don't like it. Other than that? Get over it. Bitcoin presents issues not everyone in this world is comfortable with, but here it is. Changetip presents issues for people too, like tipping a channel with multiple contributors. But, so does signing on the internet create issues for people, you can always opt-out and not sign on at all. Naysayers will just strengthen the service and make it stronger as it becomes more resilient to verbal attacks.

Your website looks like it could use a little work. I am pretty good at wordpress and there is a lot we can do with the site to promote crypto currency and raise money/awareness. If you need a hand, I'm relatively local and would like to help expand on what you have going. One of my ideas is you could easily add woocommerce + bitcoin payments for woocommerce to setup a store and sell stuff to raise money. For example, you could reward people with colored coins for donating.. something like is setup at  check it out. I am also interested in satoshi forest on the website, what is that?

I hope this works and really makes it easier.
IRS needs to make it reasonable to comply first. I use bitcoin for all my purchases that I can. I was thinking I'm going to have to hire a team of accountants to help me remember or guess at what these bitcoins sent to random addresses mean and how to tally them up. That's just to calculate my losses. Don't have any gains to show yet since I started buying in November. 
Do I still have to calculate it if I know I'm at a loss? Maybe I will consolidate all my coin, and do my best to calculate up to that point. Then I can start fresh with a new ledger and try to record my transaction more and maybe transact less to keep the record keeping down.

While there are limitations, they are reasonable. If someone wanted $10,000 in bitcoins I would scan their palm too but for $25 max like the average person is going to buy each payday? Overkill. 
Debit cards are insured by the bank anyways, if the banks start losing money over a $25 fraud maybe they will think about securing the debit cards better like not having the credit card number plastered on the front of the debit card and allowing card owners to initiate payments instead of vendors and identity thiefs.

Right, there is that. I see it like this:
If you want to continually replicate yourself in a precise manner you would want to do it from a secure source that hasn't or can't be tampered with. However, if you need to update yourself you could do so until you hit a milestone you see fit and record it to the blockchain for permanent residency. The code could continue to evolve in such a fashion without worrying if the past you that invented you is even you at all. Maybe if "you" hold the private key somehow securely you could update yourself on the blockchain at the same address.. like signing a transaction.

As far as I'm aware changetip only collects your reddit username and signup date so that it knows that is your account and it gives the money to the right person. Changetip will not be able to access your reddit password or account, as it only has access to your username and signup date which are already public info on your profile.

Chicken and egg problems work them selves out obviously because we have chickens. We are way over the chicken and egg phase, the genie is out of the bottle and Bitcoin will continue to grow and foster an entire new economy. New egg sells Dell Computers for Bitcoin, Dell just started accepting Bitcoin too. New egg can buy computers directly from Dell without ever converting Bitcoin into legacy FIAT currency. So which came first, the chicken or the New Egg?

Good to know, this doesn't solve my problem though, I don't think. Maybe you will know of a better way. I like to print my own paper wallets of a custom design. But I want them to be generated from seed AND have BIP38 AND have the ability to print copies for a backup. I don't know any way to do this fully.. I can get close by modifying bitaddress.org code to include my custom paper wallet image but they aren't generated from seed. I can generate from seed with electrum or trezor but no custom graphics on the paper wallet. Any ideas to get all the functionality with custom graphics?

You couldn't have posted this comment in one of the threads pertaining to this discussion? I'm actually getting tired of the BF FUD.. I don't know much about the foundation maybe because it is nontransparent as some say. They are continuing to make contributions to this community and any contribution no matter how small should not be matched with hate from the community. As far as developing alternative currencies, big whoop. People have the right to innovate and I applaud anyone who does. This is no different than the oppression Bitcoin and so many other new currencies have faced from legacy financial systems. Not everything has to be exactly how you want it, other things in this world can exist and the world will still turn. Let the foundation be, there are bigger things in this world to worry about like I don't know.. bitcoin (over)regulation, climate change, and fukushima for instance. Quit beating a dead horse.

There is a possibility someone could sneak out a copy that is generating preselected keys. They couldn't charge if they gave the source away and nobody can really verify it if it isn't open source. If they made it open source I'd donate $5 when the community can look it over.
I'm not saying they are scammers, they are probably completely legit and the likelihood of that happening is pretty low, I just want to be super careful with my coin, this is the whole reason for the cold storage to have peace of mind and to setup good practice for keeping tight security.

Could bitcoin atm buying be simplified with debit/pin purchasing? Consider this, if you just used your debit card with a pin to make a purchase, it seems that you can get cash back from many places after transactions without much hassle from regulation when processed with debit/pins because they are linked to your bank account that is already KYC/AML verified. Ask congress what options like this we have to simplify the process without choking it out in regulation.

I see what you mean, and I think you have a point. Remember, blockchain technology is in its infancy and storing large amounts of data aren't out of the question. I think the obvious solution would be decentralized storage such as maidsafe or storj for sufficient redundancy. Maybe the blockchain would be reduced to storing only a signature of the data to conserve space. This seems like a risk to me because the signature will only verify the data is intact rather than storing it indefinitely.

Yea but cash back doesn't operate this way, I think there is a $25 limit per transaction, which seems reasonable, if you want more go to an atm or bank.. just enough you would need for spending not laundering. If you buy a pack of gum 10 times and get $25 worth of bitcoin back each time it would actually be more traceable than cash and set off all kinds of red flags for the shop keeper and if he didn't report it then he is in on it too.

Unemployment rate is not what you think it is. It only counts the people who have looked for work in the last 4 weeks. If the individual has not looked for work in the last month he/she is considered not in the labor force and not counted. The numbers can be skewed because if the economy gets worse more and more people stop looking for work all together causing the unemployment rate to drop during a bad economy. On the flip side. the rate can also be skewed if the eceonomy turns favorable and a bunch of people enter the pool of "unemployeed" once they start looking and causing the unemployment rate to rise.

That's pretty close to what i did. I was only able to do 2 of 3 the way i did it. I put an encrypted drive that contains the seed on each usb drive. I made the password to unlock the encrypted drive the private key for a multi sig address. I then put only one share of the multi sig key on each drive. I used the bitaddress.org code to generate the multisig address, it wouldn't work with more than 2 of 3 for some reason such as 3 of 5.. The private key was different depending on which shares you used.

I like my security and setup now, I have played with many options but a trezor would be fun to try too. I already have my seed memorized so I'm not keen on having to remember a second one. I have started printing my own BIP38 wallets offline using a custom bitaddress.org generator but the paper wallets from that aren't generated from a seed. It has it's ups and down because there isn't a single point of failure but I like to generate my addresses from a seed I can always recover from my memory. If trezor can allow me to do this and print custom paper wallets of my own design from a seed I am sold.

Try exploring the address for the paper wallet and see if the funds are still in the paper wallet. importing the paper wallet shouldn't remove the funds from it afaik. Try importing the paper wallet to another source if that's the case. If not, see what address the coins were sent to and if that matches up with an address in your blockchain wallet. If their there then send blockchain.info an email and explain the problem. Maybe someone with more experience can chime in here. maybe?
edit: heartbleed wouldn't cause this.. seems like a simple fixable error. Also, just seen another user posting a similar error and it seems like they are working on the issue. Don't panic, it will work out.

That's a shapeshift issue. Never refund customer funds to the address they sent from. Ever. Addresses should never be reused. They need to hold those funds until you provide a valid address for withdraw.

That's not what I said at all. I know what your arguments are, I have seen plenty of examples: It's a ponzi, it's a scam.. no. Maybe companies and individuals are prevalent in this arena that use it as such, but bitcoin is just a technology and a protocol. It is up to all of us to use it responsibly. Traditionally many would say "Money is the root of all evil!" Nope, humans who use it for such things are evil, not money.

Seriously, the total worth of all the gold in the world is 1000x the value of all the bitcoins in the world. Gold is definitely a valuable asset that has stood the test of time, but is it worthy of 1000x the price of bitcoin? Not to me. That doesn't mean it is over valued in relation to something like the dollar but just overvalued when compared to the underdog bitcoin. So, I 'm betting on bitcoin for now even though I really like gold. I'll just wait to see how the prices normalize before I funnel more assets the other way.

1) It should have asked you for an email. I disabled the other fields for privacy reasons since the site doesn't have ssl. Also, since the payment is made in bitcoin and the files can be downloaded online there is no reason to store personal information. the email is just collected to send invoice and download link.  
2) Nice catch on the price, not such a deal! Yea it's not meant to sell I just started putting this together last night all from a smart phone. It's a proof of concept really just by adding litecoin the store becomes a manually processed currency exchange. I plan on adding a field on the checkout for the customer to input the litecoin address they want the coins sent to. 
Seems like it could be useful for many people in bankless regions to become part of the global marketplace selling goods online. Like I said I did it from a smart phone and apparently the smart phone is how most of Africa will be coming online in the next few years.

Thank you, EFF, for pointing out the obvious flaws with the proposed system. If they want to monitor bitcoin companies (within their jurisdiction), so be it. But don't require companies across the globe and completely out of jurisdiction to comply with draconian laws that only benefit the top 0.01%. Either give a reasonable way to exempt yourself without having to jump through hoops or get the fuck out of the way. Give companies a little sticker they can proudly display on the website if they decide to be complicit in these pervasive laws that subject their customers to financial privacy concerns.

I read the second article on the google search:  
They go on to state that because you get paid in bitcoin when you short it then there is no reason to short it because bitcoin would be worth less when you are paid in it. I guess it never crossed their mind you could sell the bitcoin for usd after the successful short. Give 'em all nobels.

I use these for each type of coin I have. I don't use them to generate the addresses though, I only use it to print my own addresses from my wallet that way I can have printable detailed backups that can be encrypted.
You can use windows or linux, just make sure that any networking is completely disabled. disconnect ethernet, turn off wireless, disable the adapters never reconnect to the internet if funds are stored. Use a usb key to sign transactions to maintain air gap. 
I suggest windows, but I have also accomplished cold storage effectively with a raspberry pi, it's hard to find a printer that works with pi so I transferred my prints by Sandisk SDHC to the printer.

Well I'm in a similar boat to the OP so I don't see it as being too far fetched.. I like to imagine that I'm not down as much as I am due to the cost averaging but I have also quadrupled my bitcoin holdings since I bought in at the height of the November bubble. I'm not sure what the total average but it's certainly much lower than when I first bought in. I could have sold at any point but I am more of a believer than ever now. I use bitcoin daily, and I won't go back to the old system. It's too antiquated.

The red ones are only a penny though, apply the coupon you can get it half off. what, you want btc.blue to pay the miners fee and their time for sending you colored coins to play with isn't worth half a cent? It's not like they are leading mass amounts sheep to a fleecing, this is being offered to where people should be more knowledgeable. It's a limited time offer to help fund a marketplace. FFS, people. I swear this is the same group that spots a video on youtube and shouts fake on any video that wasn't filmed by accident.

From what I have read: raising money with bitcoin as campaigns contributions is legal however you are limited to $100 worth max contribution per person. There was a senator who set a donation page stating this. I am not sure how this would work when someone could easily just send more than the max allowed to the address.  Also, the value fluctuates from when it was sent so theres that to keep track of. Other than that you just need to build the site to handle it, I wouldn't mind helping if it's a paid gig.

Even a 1% increase in the monetary supply every year is exponential, which is even worse if you think about the 2% which is advertised, or the 3-4% which it actually is.

You can't purchase bitcoin with paypal easily because bitcoin transactions are permanent but paypal payments can be reversed. Too big of a risk to be ripped off.

I got this email in reply to me asking why I can't trade even though my state is on the list:
Hi Nedradnad,
Thanks for reaching out about Robinhood Crypto.
Apologies for the inconvenience! You're on the list to be approved, but we still have to validate that you reside in a Crypto-eligible state. This validation process considers multiple criteria and, as a result, even some users with mailing addresses in Florida such as yourself may not yet have access to Robinhood Crypto. This is, unfortunately, why you are unable to trade with Robinhood Crypto right now.
We do not require any additional documentation from you at this time and we will be sure to let you know when you are approved!
We understand this may be frustrating, but we're working to improve this process going forward and hope to welcome you to Robinhood Crypto in the near future; however, we do not have an exact ETA for you at this time. We appreciate your patience in this matter, please understand that we're working on remedying this!
Feel free to respond to this email if you have any additional questions.

I got the cash app the other day and realized they had bitcoin, did a test buy of $10. It's worth $11.50 now. I don't regret it but I sure wish I had bought more. Fuck fuck fuck.
@_date: 2019-04-10 01:38:20
If you're going to deal on the dark web you need the funds, there are only so many p2p places to exchange cash for coin. Criminals laundering would see value in this system and people who use the system are very aware of the possible uses. That doesn't mean the gov should target sellers because some clients will abuse it, but it does make sense why that is where their attention is. It's hard for authorities to fight what this technology enables so they are going after the weak links in the chain, the money trail. It's a risky business but you have to know if you are in that market you better dot your I's and cross your t's.
Not making excuses or justifying it.. it's fucked, they know it. The reason they do it anyways is because they don't have better ideas.

Yea the second time i went to the link and submit a response on their contact form bitching them out for repeatedly spamming me with the same message, letting them know every one that comes through gets reported immediately as spam.

We aren't that far away from 1 bit = $1. 1 Satoshi is just around the corner. But yea that's the upper limit in this day and age. Every major bubble should take longer and longer. Even when it stabilizes like gold, measuring Satishis in dollars could happen easily with inflation even if bitcoin value didn't rise any more from this point.

No, but seeing how 2 agents conspired together to commit crimes, I would say that this counts as a conspiracy.
@_date: 2015-04-07 05:45:47
I said nothing about censorship other than it is an example of potential abuses you could engage in. I explicitly stated that I have no evidence of you censoring. Is there room for improvement in the Bitcoin protocol? It depends on who you ask, some will say it needs to be more scale-able, Devs are working on it. Some say it needs to be more anonymous, other developers are working on that as well. Is it perfect for me? It does everything I expect it to, nothing more and nothing less. Will it cease to function optimally in the future because it is being overloaded with demand? Hopefully not, but what a wonderful problem to have.

Also, Bitcoin has taken a big slice of the the precious metals payment processing market. Not necessarily the market share yet so much as being a preferred payment processor. Taking over one niche at a time.

You forgot the one with free transactions.
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:24:56
Nah, I was curious and did the math a while back. Came to the conclusion that Gold is either overvalued or Bitcoin is severely undervalued. I think it's the latter.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:28:03
That would be difficult since Coinbase doesn't sell IOTA. And I'm not referring to withdrawal fees.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:31:05


You mean because people aren't gullible enough to jump on the altcoin bandwagon when Bitcoin already accomplishes the same thing.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:58:48
I can send free transactions with IOTA right now, the energy cost is negligible. If you can tell me how to send my bitcoin from my ledger nano s to coinbase and back for free right now that would be great.

The fact that you think it is one big joke and that you are seeking out "comedy gold" by ridiculing users who are passionate about the technology discussed in a forum you moderate is why I think you are unfit to be a moderator here.

IOTA is ternary and the processors it is designed to run on are more efficient than binary processors. Even if processing power was more costly on IOTA, it is still is much less than lightning network fees. Also, it scales, so there is that.

Deposits to circle are instant and bitcoin shows up immediately, you can then withdraw it instantly as well but take 3 days to process in the antiquated banking system.

I have Quickbooks online but I don't see the PayByCoin option. I have the cheap version that doesn't allow you to do everything, but you can still do everything if you do it manually.
Just click add new under payment method and type bitcoin, done.
Also the cheap version doesn't allow you to bill by hour just by amount of items. So instead of say 3 x "trash removal" just type 3 x "hours of trash removal" instead, problem solved. Also you can't input your bills until you pay them.. so just create a spreadsheet for your bills and enter them into quickbooks as you pay. No biggie.

Well, I'm not opposed to those but I try to buy silver at a good price so I can get my money back when I resell.. When I buy copper I buy in bulk as well. So if you could mint a 10lb copper comparable to the other 10lb bars I'd be interested in that for sure. I actively buy generic silver and silver eagles because of the quantity/price ratio. If I can get some with a bitcoin symbol at a good price I would definitely buy a bunch of those. Not saying there is anything wrong with proofs, but there are certain buyers for those. I'm not knocking your product, it's really great, just my 2 cents. 
Edit: As far as being able to put my private key on there, I prefer to have the ability to do that myself so if you leave one side blank in the center and sell the stickers, I can print my own key it would make me feel safer too. Just some feedback from a person that is in the market to buy, I wish you much success!

Not with BitPay, but Tony Gallippi owes me $20 personally. I gave up on collecting after he refused to contact me on the matter.

You should try getting a life. I was doing school work today and spending time with my GF. Loser troll whom has never conducted a bitcoin transaction in his life gives bitcoin users advice.

And they are right, nobody really gives a shit except for those who lost money and the told ya so trolls. Bitcoin certainly couldn't care less.

I'm thinking Karples should sue. I think we are all due some money due to the damages these agents inflicted on Gox and the resulting collapse in the price. If any lawyers want to take on a class action suit I'd sign up.

Yea, should send him an invoice first and then take him to small claims if he doesn't.

I get it, I just I never buy proofs because of the cost and resale value, some people do though. I would love me some generic bitcoin rounds I can slap my own sticker on. There is a market for both, I'm just more of a quantity over quality guy. Why not sell both?
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:03:21
To be fair, Circle has limits as well.. ($1000 for CC and $5,000 for bank accounts).

When you start adding up the atrocities, the tole is pretty heavy in this war against bitcoin. The innovators will probably be next if the SEC has their way.

They are liable for damages they caused. IANAL, but according to some site on the internet:

The same corrupt government official that was shown to illegally confiscate funds from a users at another exchange signed the warrant seizing the funds. If it can be proven that this was an illegal act, he may be determined liable and so will the government agencies he acted under.
Not only does the report show that the agent removed BTC, but also signed the warrant that seized the dollars in the bank account.

I think it would be best if the issuing agency retained the private keys and the serial number for the bill could be the public key. That way people could verify the actual backing by bitcoin but wouldn't have incentive to destroy the bills to get to the private key. They would have to redeem for bitcoin at a bank where they can verify the authenticity of the note and put it back into circulation.

I second what Bob said. They're there, just keep the mnemonic safe until you find a work around or they issue a patch.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:49:48
Perhaps you are correct and there is not a case, I think it would be worth it for someone with substantial losses to hire an attorney to look into the matter anyways, just to make sure.

Congrats, I have expressed my interest to be part of the changetip team a few times and they declined without even requesting my resume or offering an application. I had the pleasure of dealing with support over the course of several days and it was very obvious that they needed more help (but probably wasn't in the budget.) Support seemed pretty clueless about their own system but they deposited my money anyways after many exchanges even though they failed to properly diagnose the cause of the problem.

Sue the pants off these agents and the agencies that enabled them. I want in on the class action suit. We are all owed damages, from those that had funds on Gox, to anyone that held Bitcoin at the time of the resulting price collapse.

I think the really interesting thing is, these police are allowing themselves to be a victim of a crime which they are supposed to be protecting citizens against. In the process, encouraging the attackers to continue by rewarding them for their efforts. Tax payers foot the bill.
