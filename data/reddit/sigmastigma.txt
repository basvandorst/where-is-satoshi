Localbitcoins has a [transaction service]( set up. Very easy and safe.
* Seller moves Btc to localbitcoins wallet, and funds a transaction
* You meet, exchange money
* Seller releases the funds, and buyer receives a code to match on their transaction side
* Only the buyer and localbitcoins can cancel the transaction at this point, so if the seller doesn't release the funds the staff will investigate

I emailed them about it. Hopefully I actually get bitcoins I ordered, at the price I ordered them, otherwise they lost me.
Edit: Went into their irc channel ( and received excellent support. Reinstated the order at the original trading value.

Know any Bayesian inference methods?

Also good experience with them after contacting them. Bought around 80, order flagged as "high risk," and after I spoke with someone they reinstated the order at the original price. It was at 120 something at the time too.

Exactly, but currently most people want it. At least at MtGox, buyers currently outnumber sellers almost 4 to 1.

I had a pending order for 4 that was supposed to clear 8:29 EDT that I have been checking since then, which has just magically disappeared right now. This is just ridiculous.

Also had a similar experience, that ended excellently. Went into irc and got it settled within 20 minutes, they even put through the original order at that price, which was about $20 lower than market. Great service if you get in touch with them.
