That's for the convenience of payment processors or similiar. How do you think Mastercard or Visa makes any money? The overhead on bitcoin transactions is just so much less that providers like BitPay can offer a much lower price.
Still, the underlying network is cheap and you can use it without any third party processor. You may not like fees trading companies impose on you, then stop using them.

But there are no marketplaces that confirm the transactions, this is done by miners as a byproduct of block discovery. It's an transaction fee, not a marketplace fee and you're confusing your customers if you switch the terms. Your transaction fee of 2€ is actually a marketplace fee (which I don't think is reasonable, you're saving all the usual fees and still want an additional amount?) and the marketplace fee is the transaction fee. Your misconception of how transactions are confirmed and who receives this (mandatory) fee adds to this confusion.
Bitcoin clients deal with that transaction fee, either paying it automatically or allowing a manual amount.  Your advice of manually adding it **actually increases the risk** of overpaying. When BitPay is asking for 1 BTC, you send them exactly 1 BTC, the fee is handled independently.




That paragraph says two different things in each language, and is wrong. 
BitPay accepting and confirming the payement are two different things. For the first you have 15 minutes initiating the payment (which takes seconds to detect) and the account holder can set the needed confirmations by the network based on risk/speed from 1 up to 6. 6 confirmations generally take about an hour, but can take longer as it depends on the discovery of new blocks (10min average). I don't see why a transaction should be cancelled if it takes more than an hour to be confirmed.

Bitcoins transaction fee is already in effect, for my last transaction of $1040 I payed a fee of $0.11 to receive a high priority status and get confirmed faster. This is a 0.01% fee, nothing compared to the 2-4% traditional companies charge.

WebMoney.ru allows the exchange of Bitcoins, I just purchased a led stripe on AliExpress, using WebMoney as payment processor while effectively paying with Bitcoins.
The registration process is complicated and you need some verification, but it's possible.

The problem with PETA is that shares were 0.069 just a few days ago. After some discussion in the bitcointalk forum and looking at the newest jump in mining power, a few think that PETA will not stay above the curve and it's dividends will plummet in the next few weeks. 
I just bought in at 0.068 and will probably stay in a bit longer. Keep in mind that the shares sold at below that price is insignificant compared to the total number of shares.

The developers did code the solutions and they were available a long time. It took 2 years for the miners to agree on which exactly they want.
 On one hand the core developers are accused of forcing their solutions unton the network, on the other they didn't force them enough. Which is it?

I would prefer that people learn to not leave a big amount of either $ or btc on any exchange and be independent of them. 
It's true I guess, MtGox is still an important part of the network and does affect the price more than it should. How we can change that is another question, time will hopefully bring alternatives in form of p2p exchange and/or more trustworthy exchanges up to the task managing that amount of money.

It doesn't matter what Satoshi or anyone would do, &gt;50% of the network needs to agree to any change in protocol and it's probably save to say that adding new coins will not happen ever.
Bitcoins aren't the only reward for finding a new block, miners additionally recieve the transaction fees for their block. Blocks will be mined forever at an average rate of 10 minutes, even if the direct reward of coins is miniscule. Only time can tell if the transaction fees alone are enough incentive for the miners.
