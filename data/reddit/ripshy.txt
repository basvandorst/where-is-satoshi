I don't understand, can you explain?  
I took a photo of a vehicle parked on a public street and posted it to a shared interest group. What mess?
Addendum:  I thought this thing was awesome and was excited to see it.  Whats the problem?

I mean, I took the photo...so its real.

I see someone from the shop has posted as well, I personally thought it was awesome to see and wanted to share the photo.  However, I'm not really getting the same vibe from his/her post.  You all cool with this post staying up?

OH!  And an API key too!

Aware of this, but I was sticking to what we know right now.

Posh!  This is why I carry a rubber stamp with me at all times.

Nice...i see your under stats.  Try again.

Usually when a domain goes out, the registrar will change the name servers listed.  This, is "propogated" in a sense...could be what Tebbo was referring to.

You've just earned yourself a hat, good man.

Nah brah, Gregory Evans.  He's the WORLD'S NO 1 HACKER, right? ;)

And it would cost you an extra $300 to $500 in fees, which is why no one does this.

Well, you actually have to calculate the hash flux redux factor of a given sha256 string every time you pass it through the Biscotti function to be able to discern the Total Open Orpheus Locality Standards(aka TOOLS). 
When you throw IPv6 into the equation, however, it becomes clear that it is in fact potato.  
Simple Theory...

WEP was a pretty blatant fuck up though, due to whoever write the implementation not having an expert level understanding of what they were doing.  Bit flipping the corresponding the encrypted stream cipher before XOR was a known problem, as well as the possibility of obtaining cipher texts that had been encrypted using the same key stream, then statistical attacks yield the key.  They used integrity checks and an initialization vector to mitigate these flaws, and did it poorly.
Sorry, rambling...anyways, point is...BitCoin was done correctly, and many many encryption buffs have vetted it.
Edit - Well, I admit...should say "done correctly so far as we know right now".
