I agree with you in a perfect system, but shouldn't it be able to handle bad actors too?

Why'd you call him out when you pretty much commented the exact same thing three times in this thread?
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:23:46
That’s a pretty big if.

I see what you're saying, but I interpreted it a different way. 
These numbers are made up. However, just for the sake of argument, let's say that the average fees were $5. Then, mining pools could keep spamming part of the block to slowly boost up the average fee. By partially clogging the network they could hypothetically keep boosting the average fees to let's say  $40.
At this point, even though the pools have lost a fair amount of money to get the fees this high, they now are collecting $40 per transaction as opposed to $5. Then the congestion and high fees get people to panic and causes more confusion, allowing the miners to keep getting however much in fees in full blocks. 
This is all hypothetical, and there is probably flaws in my reasoning. With that being said though, I think it is entirely possible for something similar to be happening to a certain extent.

I mean he’s right though. Like what are your counterpoints?

Lol 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin right?
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:07:22
That is absolutely horrible advice.

Regarding scalability do you think there is something better to use or at least mention other than market cap? I definitely see where you're coming from especially on what many speculate the market cap for cryptocurrencies as a whole is. I feel a lot more comfortable mentioning the cap of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other somewhat established and minable coins but even then I think it should be taken with a grain of salt.

That was the route I was thinking of going as I vaguely remember seeing that or something similar.
Also, besides some of what is also mentioned in the graph and without having to go into too much about what I am writing about is there anything that you (or anyone else for that matter) think would be helpful to include its market cap or something similar to market cap? I haven't gotten too much into the section yet but was probably going to have the M2 money supply or something along those lines to tie into smart contracts but again haven't looked into it in depth.

Thanks to both of you! That wasn't the graph that I was thinking of but I used it to find [the one that I was looking for]( (which turns out to be the same thing). I completely agree that the scales are off and the chart as it is right now wouldn't be the best in the context that I am writing in anyways. Thanks again.

Yeah I sure do hate my useless US dollars that are accepted everywhere in the US. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:21:41
This is perfect, thank you!

If the satellite arrives in 2026 how would the market be flooded after 2026, would it still be years until that’s possible?
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:21:30
Literally all of those are terrible comparisons.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:33:40
Lol I think it would be hilarious if you single handedly made bitcoin crash.
