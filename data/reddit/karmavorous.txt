So "most US Citizens", when they put their heads together to vote, they make aful decisions amd elect bad leaders time and time again...
Yet somehow in a *free market* when they put their heads together, the outcome will be all awesome and economically stable and environmentally sound.
You've swallowed a lot of kool-aid dude.

That's a silly analogy.
People who are drunk driving aren't fantasizing about crashing into people and killing them.
A better analogy would be if you stood on a sidewalk and swung a baseball bat around.
And if that's the case, then I think the other users of the sidewalk have a right to stop you.

Rand *sounds* like his father. He says the same platitudes, rallies the same base with the same rhetoric. 
But his actions (how he votes as a legislator) are pretty lockstep with other Republicans.
His state is a big Coal state.
He's voted multiple times to extend "tax subsidies" to energy companies - when those "tax subsidies" actually result in a negative tax burden for those companies (they get back million of dollars more than they pay). Corporate Welfare - if he's actually against it, he has a funny way of showing it.
He's been a vocal critic of "Pork Barrell Spending" and then recently he bragged about bringing home a multi-hundred billion dollar load of pork to build new pieces of infrastructure that will help Coal remain a dominant source of energy.
He's been vocal against the Executive Branch using drones on domestic and foreign targets. And then two days after his 18 hour filibuster on the topic, he told Fox News that he though it would be appropriate to use a drone "on someone that comes out of a liquor store with a gun and $50." Essentially nullifying that whole "Government can't execute people without a trial" nonsense.
He speaks with forked tongue.
His actions are almost always in lockstep with the Mitt Romneys of the world.
