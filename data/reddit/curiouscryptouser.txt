Definitely, I did not think of putting them together.

Sorry I got confused with BIP39. Yeah BIP38 is for encrypting paper wallets. Agree it is not a good idea.

Genuinely happy for them, I would've chosen something like thunder for the name though :)

Can you guys compile it? It fails at the autogen step for me.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:48:43
Could you please expand on this, why has anyone done that already?

Started to have a look because I am looking for a SegWit wallet and their stealth mode is awesome. I was wondering though if it is possible to see the changes made to bitcoinj given that it looks like they are using a custom jar file..

Bisq is the best alternative to date.

What you are spreading here is misinformation about Ethereum. I would strongly recommend, for your own growth, to explore again Ethereum's solutions to scaling, one of which came as collaboration between one of the main contributors to Lightning.

I increasingly dislike these kind of videos as they don't paint reality appriately. What happened in the last couple of years may or may not repeat. Invest what you can afford to lose. For instance the folks who invested last January are now losing more than 50% of their money. YMMV.

Funny I just received the same treatment from HSBC. On the contrary RBC is embracing change (from what I hear).

Do not know about of, but my bank drafted to another bank.

That's a pretty big amount for a closed source project. I would not sleep at night.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:55:26
Peer reviews are what counts, not binaries or compile.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:58:22
In this you are right, so you should push instead on good CI and reproducible builds+sha256+key verification. Coinomi does not have any of that.
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:02:09
I cannot answer the market part but I would be interested. The only app that has multi currency at the moment is Coinomi but it is closed source - no good.
I was thinking myself of either fork their Android code base that is in the repo or contribute multi-coin capability to Samourai. Didn't have time to even thinking of starting it though :)

I have a setup for the secure node option but for some reason it does not connect to it. Shall I open an issue on GitHub? Do you have suggestion on what to try?
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:26:44
Of course not
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:48:42
This looks great, especially the bank deposit option, which looks completely anonymous.. it anonymous though? Aren't they going to ask you the ID as the branch?
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:43:56
I suggest to do a simple test:
Go to the bip39 generator and using an offline computer, which at never touched the internet (tails on USB), insert your words to familiarize yourself with it. Derivation for segwit should be m/49'/0'/0'/0.
In Derived Address section you should see the same addresses that you have used in your Trezor.
Note I have never tried this against a Trazor so it would be great to know if things actually match the bip39 standard.

Well the seller seemed pretty nervous and quite frankly a novice so when sending I did not stop him from selecting economy low fees.
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:18:25
Thank you, fixed!
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:56:55
It seems like you would be trading your spending habits for crypto. Haven't tried it myself but seems interesting.
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:25:59
Well thanks anyways ;)
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:13:00
Good to know and good idea. They could still have fabricated it. At the end of the day the fact that you can revert is the flaw :)
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:45:52
It might be unrelated but the Electron version you are using it kind of old.
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:56:19
Yeah so this maybe was not put very well but I was at a cafe buying from another person not from the cafe itself.
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:15:30
If you see the funds at the address it's all good, there are ways to recover them given the words and the passphrase you choose at the beginning (not the pin of course).
Those two form your bip39 seed.
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:03:31
Yes that is what I did, they sent me a letter saying that the sender's bank reported the transaction as fraudulent. I was asking here if somebody has more experience on how to proceed.

Oh I thought we were talking about Canada
