think I had a few months of consistent usage before they upped my limits
the deposit limit is $2,500 to start. the $100 is what they will instantly release to you as soon as you initiate the deposit

We're no longer using bitcoin anymore... we're all using coinbasecoin these days

One thing to realize is that many of the most vocal and critical voices in this sub are sometimes those who are engaged in illegal activity or are fraudsters themselves! Of course many innocent people also get dragged up when Circle or Coinbase try to weed out the criminals and fraudsters -- and that's a pity.
In actuality, Circle is one of the most reputable business in the bitcoin industry -- you can see their management and VC backers:

Or you can all it bitpay always short-changing you, or you can call it coinbase charging you a fee per transaction... yup pick any of those.
It's not just 'creative language.' If you think the Circle rate is high relative to everyone else, you can sell at that rate with no fees! They aren't pulling any tricks, there is no spread and there is no fee.
By the way, you do realize when you buy from Coinbase you pay a 1% fee on top of the price right?

Except that Bitreserve cannot send out or receive in USD. As in they have no connections to credit/debit cards or bank accounts.
