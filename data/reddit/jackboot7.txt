In the short term is either: buy goods to sell them in the next six months, buy "black market" dollars, or buy bitcoins.  Having bolívares is not worth it.
I said: "buying bitcoins", no one thinks of bitcoins as currency in which you can be paid, more like stocks.

Creo que más que hacerse un _rig_, la idea es recibir bitcoins como pago, del mismo modo que hay gente que prefiere cobrar dólares.
Translation: I believe that more than making yourself a _rig_, the idea is to get bitcoins as payment for your work, the same way that some people are getting paid in USD.

You use something like Mercadolibre (Ebay equivalent) to buy. There still are small imports coming into the country. You can use your $300 limit to buy something in amazon and then sell it x15 the price.

I don't know... Bitcoin hasn't have any real reach in the general public over here, I believe that once the law makers realize it is a danger to their interests, they'll begin to push for a ban.

Sure, people treat them as if they were stocks, the bad side is that only medium/upper class people knows or are interested in stocks/bitcoin/invesment. The working class still have to deal with bolívares which seem to lose value each day.

Venezuelan here, most of the people who knows about bitcoin here think of it as some form of "investment", not as currency.

Sure, even buying a new plasma TV, to sell in two or three months. Buying precious metals is an option, but they are valued in USD exchanged bolívares.

No one I know. Most of use it as a way to "obtain dollars".
