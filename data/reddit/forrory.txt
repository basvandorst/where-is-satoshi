Could we not improve upon the localbitcoins model?  Escrow function built into wallets using time lock and multisig? 
Two parties meet online and enter into BTC contract via wallet. 
Parties agree upon price, time lock duration and security deposit.
BTC seller send BTC using timelocked &amp; multisig. Once Fiat is confirmed both parties sign. 
Seller is incentivize not to steal because he wants his security deposit back. 
Buyer can only receive BTC once seller confirms fiat deposit and signs. If buyer never send Fiat timeloc expires and BTC goes back to seller. 
How to protect sellers from having their BTC locked up by trolling buyers &amp; how to protect buyers from sellers willing to run down the time lock?
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:13:09
Make sense now. I found it odd that a segwit with bip38 was so hard to find. Glad I didn't try anything I did find. 
Hardware wallet will probably be the next step then.

What happens if we reduced the size of our nodes mempool. Effectivity removing the market depth of the fee market. Would spam transactions have the same effect they do today? We could control the transaction pool... miners forced to incorporate latest transactions or forfeit fees. Users get quick transaction rejects when fee is inadequate and spam never lasts in the pool.

I've noticed that they are nowhere near as efficient with their transactions vs block size. Blocks are huge with minimal transaction count.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:48:55
Thanks for the clear explanation. I was wrong to use the term latest transaction. 
If the memory pool size was reduced would it remove the effectiveness of some of the tactics currently used to spam it? 
We would have less variation in what's is consider the current fee rate. Would this make it easier to accurately calculate the best current fee?
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:15:18
Yes I've been considering this.  Given the lack of segwit and BIP38 support it is probably the best option. 
I'm just not completely sold on the physical devices yet. I did come across an open source device in development that seemed interesting.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:54:26
I'm sure if they had a better way to calculate fee they would. They are a business after all. The question here is of the game theory works... If reducing the mempool size could remove some of the suspected fee minipulation it would prove and easy bandaid fix till lightning network matures. 
We wouldn't have to waste devs time to support this. Same way we ran campain to tag nodes with NO2X we all set our mempool size lower. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:53:39
What about a PoW where the work type keep changing at random between the different algorithms? 
Wouldn't this be ASIC proof by  definition? Since the ASIC would have to be suitable of preforming multiple applications.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:08:47
If transactions are free it won't cost anything to spam the network. And the chain will grow and grow up to 8x as fast. 
But yes Bcash is much better. Now go fix your random block size bug.

This. Vote with your wallet is one way. The other is submit a ticket. Then place a phone call. This will hit them directly and cost them money. Sooner or later the business case to implement segwit and batching will make it a priority.

This. I have to throttle my node so I don't go over my 400gb cap. Data usage between 2am and 8am is free so the throttle is lifted between those hours. 2mb blocks would force me to shutdown my node.

You would want to execute both transactions at the same time. 
Scan this $100 USD item and app says that going to be 0.001 BTC I then check a small box saying replace my BTC. Since this is the current market rate when I accept the transaction the app/wallet will send $100usd worth of BTC to the merchant and place an order at the same time for $100 USD worth of bitcoin. It should balance out minus any fees. If 
Coinbase wallet this did it would rekt.

We need a Bitcoin credit card which will auto buys more Bitcoin each time you spend on it. This would balance out any bitcoin price movements.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:02:25
Standard financial teachings tell you what is happening in Bitcoin is a bubble. The fast price growth and the lack of underpinning assets. 
Wall street will apply this logic and take short positions on BTC price. Wall street is a sizable force and traders will notice their positions. This thinking might push BTC price down. When the dust settles investors who understand BTC will swoop in and add to their positions. Any bankster who is shorting BTC at this point is contemplating defenestration.
This is one senario.

Lol thanks Capt. 
Maybe look up white hats and black hats. 
I recall about a few weeks back another large cryptocurrency (2nd largest) had an issue with some poorly created wallets or something. Anyways when it was discovered white hat hackers seeked out affected wallets and essentially took other people's coins for safe keeping. I can't recall the exact figure but I'm sure it was in the millions. Those hackers then gave all the money back once the issue was resolved. 
Maybe some hackers are more interested in seeing crypto succeed then stealing from a miner attached to a full node. I would of acted the same way for $15 bux... A couple million well that might rattle my morals a bit.��

Yes to the wallet I have the pool configured. 
Then those coins were moved not by me to my coinbase wallet.
The transaction that moved my coins was done while I was out at a party. I only use that wallet to recieve pool payments and then I manually move them to coinbase. Each time I do this I use a new coinbase address as coinbase generates them. 
This transaction in question just used the same criteria (wallet ID) as the last transaction in the wallet history. 
  
@_date: 2017-09-24 13:53:27
Thanks for your valuable insight.
Unfortunately unless my landlord knows the password to my PC and felt like completing some transactions for me. There is no other explaination.
I'll reiterate the known facts:
-Coins were moved at 1 am when I wasn't home yet. And I don't have that wallet key on my phone. This is verifiable via the blockchain and my Google maps history from both my GFs phone and mine.
- At the sametime to the minute the wifi card on one Miner disconnects and drops off the pool. Verified by screenshots of the pool data stream. 
-The address coins were moved to was an old coinbase generates wallet ID (it was just a mirror of the transaction details of my last transaction in the wallet history) If you check my wallet history you'll see I always generate a new wallet ID each time I transfer funds to coinbase. This person couldn't do that since they couldn't access my coinbase. Verified by my wallet history, blockchain records and emails in file from coinbase.
-I've been mining for months without issue. That node went live literally hours before this happened. Verifiable maybe by Bitcoin nodes 21 website? 
So please respectfully understand why I do not accept your unsupported "No" response.

But my girlfriend agrees I didn't touch the computer when I got home. Even that wouldn't explain how the transaction was sent before we got home. The key for the wallet only lives on that PC as that's the PC I created the wallet on.
I don't think it was enough money worth stealing... If someone left some small change exposed in their convertible would you steal it?
I got all the screen shots to back up my story and if anyone knows how to check any logs I'd be willing to look. I'm not interesting in finding the person but would like to figure out what happened.

A Bitcoin node is computer running Bitcoin core wallet. It acts as transaction relay on the network. Connecting to other nodes and passing Bitcoin transactions onto other nodes and miners to be included in blocks. 
Running a Bitcoin node will not generate any kind of profit. 
You do it solely to contribute to the Bitcoin network.

I suggest we do this by always suggesting and promoting the company's which did NOT sign the NYA.

The two plus billion people in China and India have friends and family all over the world. I have friends that send money via bitcoin back home. 
We can not just declare that half the world today can not afford to use Bitcoin as is so we should build the software without their requirements in mind. This is short sighted. 
They will build a new Bitcoin that works for them and by definition is better than the current bitcoin. 
I wouldn't call downloading/installing and letting a program update a project. An 8 year old could do it. You could also hand the block chain to a friend via old hard drive like I did.

The world is a big place and while I may upgrade my computer every couple years and my spare machines can easily run node software this may not be true for the rest of the world. India, rural China, Africa etc are examples of places where you may not find all hardware is capable of supporting current node software. Let alone this hardware being classified as spare and the electricity to run it. This same logic applies to internet connections. I live in a first world country and I have to throttle my nodes internet connection due to data limits.
If bitcoin is truly to succeed as a currency available to all/decentralized it needs to remain light weight.  Ideally you would want every wallet software to function as a full node. 
This is the direction we should be squeezing the protocol towards not just throwing more resources at the problem.

Hehe I can't wait to be rich! 
Owning Bitcoin is like winning the lottery in slow motion.

Not true. This is just marketing. An HDMI cable carries digital signal so as long as the signal makes it to the other end the materials of the connectors or wire does matter.

I'm not checking your math but if you divide by 21 million that "valuation" is wrong. Bitcoin is only at ~16.7 million coins.

Shakepay is the way to go right now in Canada.
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:22:30
Reporting back...  Was able to get verified by morning and bought 1k in BTC today. Moved it from shakepay to private BTC address with no issues. 
Transaction fee paid was 4sats/byte
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:31:05
Bahaha there it is bankster FUD. Telling us to sell our coins and buy their shitty products.
HODL only. Don't let them have your coins!

I signed up for the Shakepay app last night (Canadian company). Transferred funds successfully via interact in minutes and was able to get verified to buy BTC by morning. Bought 1k in BTC in Canada from my TD Bank account. Transferred it to a bitcoin address outside of Shakepay no hiccups. You don't need the banks. Bypass them!
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:17:26
Testing this out. Fast and streamline account creation and funding via interact e transfer. 
Money showed up in my account I'm minutes but in order to buy BTC I need to verify my identity via the following process:
"We'll need two documents from you, one from each category.
Note that the documents must be in original PDF format downloaded from the provider's website. It cannot be a scan, photocopy, or picture of the document.
Category A 
Utility bill (electricity, water, mobile phone, internet)Benefits statement or T4 statement
Category B
Credit card statement Bank statement Mortgage or loan account statement
Please email them to shakepay (here's the PGP if you care to encrypt the email). Also, please specify your username in the email."
Will report back once complete.

Sorry I never followed up.
So I signed up before they offered instant verification and it only took me a few hours once I had submitting my documents via email.
My understanding is now with instant verification this step is no longer required.
A friend of mine I referred was verified instantly. 
Interact transfers show up within minutes. Most of the wait is due to the time it takes the bank to issue the transfer.
This is definitely the best option I've found to date for Canadian to buy BTC. Prices on Shakepay are often lower then current market rate. Only fee is 1.75% when changing Fiat for crypto or vice versa. No fee to send and receive BTC.
Use my referral and we both earn $10.
My question to Shakepay is what are the daily and weekly $ value limits for interact transfers?
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:48:06
Can you move your BTC from shakepay once you've bought it?
Any hoops to jump through?

Or company X pays electronics manufacturers an up front free to integrate their device into the product. The product will consume a bit more power but nothing noticeable. Every plugged in device charger, WiFi router etc is now mining crypto... For company X. 
Company X is run by the Chinese government.

I waited for the mempool to be empty for 4 days. Today I sent money from Coinbase and paid over 250s/b.  We need to push exchanges on this issue harder.

So with this setup you are discribing... I am in control of my coins? Or can coinbase still take them?
What happens if I lose my keys? Can coinbase still return me coins to me after I prove my identity? 
I don't see how I can have it both ways... I hope this is the case.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:36:01
Can you expand on this? Is there a way to control your keys yet still use coinbase and not have to worry about backing up and securing your own data?
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:59:14
There's gotta be a better way! 
No seriously, all these solutions are way too complicated for the average person.     Seems this has yet to be solved. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:36:39
Yes it is dangerous.
@_date: 2018-12-20 02:21:02
Anyone aware of a guide which explains the steps? 
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:48:49
Is there a way to generate wallet address which doesn't use JavaScript and can be done offline in the same manner as today's Javascript websites?
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:54:00
Yes I keep the key to my mining wallet online. The payout is a miniscule amount at $15 USD this is by design/ convenience. Wallets with any real funds are stored on paper at the bank.
The point is you run a node you are assumed to deal in crypto. This puts your at risk. Just because someone tipped their hat at me doesn't mean others will be as lucky.
We are asking others to run node and help Bitcoin but people should know the risks.
