Haha. Fortunately for us there is no problem making custom drawing in a particular style.

I'm always surprised to hear liberal used as a derogatory term. It literally means.. willing to respect or accept behaviour or opinions different from one's own; open to new ideas.
How is this a bad thing?

"holding to traditional attitudes and values and cautious about change"
I'm sorry but that doesn't sound like a good thing. Sounds like the definition of closed-mindedness.

Thanks! We look forward to your custom.

You live in America. I live in the UK and we don't have conservatism like you do, even the Conservative party is considered liberal by your standards. 
Problem is most conservatives won't allow evidence to even change their view. If we always stuck to traditional values we would have never abolished slavery etc. etc. 
The definition I got was from Google. It would be funny if Google was giving us different definitions based on our viewing habits.
Did you do "define: liberal"?

Can you explain this paragraph in more detail? "I have now a database of about 70 Gigabytes of RIPEMD160 + Password entries. Each entry is duplicated for the compressed and uncompressed version of point conversion"

**Buy up cheap coins and sell them on other exchanges.**
**Make all the right noises about the btc withdrawals coming back online soon prompting more people to**
**pump fiat into the exchange.**
**If price rises too high dump a load of btc on their own exchange.**

The caricature is unique as it is based on the image you send us. 
Do you mean it's not unique because it's in the style of The Simpsons or Family Guy?

Hold on a minute two comments ago someone else's money was your concern. 
You're just bitter because you got shafted.

My bet is that it's his personal Bitcoin address and he's just going to credit your account. But I'm the cynical type.

You've totally missed the point here.

This happens all the time already. Except by hackers who target your site then demand Bitcoins to go away.

Do you honestly believe that the London Underground map is complicated? 
Do you also think there are too many letters in the alphabet?

They are obviously selling them. How could they survive otherwise?

Yeah, a bottle of Bud in the UK is about $6 or $7.

I don't see the problem with the n00b questions. They never get near the top and help people get into Bitcoin. 
I hate when a place becomes all elitist and that is what is starting to happen here.

That's not what he... don't worry.

Hi theymos, where do you see Bitcoin in 10 years from now?
@_date: 2013-01-06 19:28:37
Technicalities aside, it's a decentralised deflationary currency and the other is a centralised inflationary fiat currency.

Yeah we did OK. But we sold the equipment in the end and that ended up making us the profit. 
We mined over 200 coins but sold them for $7 each. I know, ouch right. This was at the start of last year.
