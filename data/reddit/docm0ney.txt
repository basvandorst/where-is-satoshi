Wow the level of discipline here is through the roof!
Perhaps what matters most is how much BTC you actually have (which I won't ask obviously) but if it was a life changing amount to sell at ATH I would have clicked away.
It's not always about the flashy bullshit.
If I had hundreds of Bitcoins well before the ATH and somehow didn't sell before it hit it's peak... I would have taken care of so many things financially but acquiring more assets would have been a priority to ensure there's still income.
Easier said than done in most markets / areas but here in the States, real estate is making a huge comeback. Especially where I live! Would have been a young millionaire dumb fast. (minus the 6 years it took to reach ATH since I first heard about Bitcoin and the freakshow Winklevoss twins)  The happiness comes from knowing I can live like most can't.

So I'm still confused lol. Did you sell any when it hit the ATH at all!? Because in the 17k-20k range there was plenty of time to read the dip before it went all the way back down to the 3-6k range and I'd imagine anyone this heavily (recklessly) invested would have cashed out and celebrate lmao!  
Interesting story though. I'm not nearly as reckless, and I don't have ANY BTC because it's so fucking expensive (My stubborn ass doesn't want to by fragments of one BTC) so I invested recklessly into decent alts near the end of 2017. It paid off, made a good chunk of change but not as much as I could have had I picked cheaper alts (TRX specifically)  
This time around I'm aiming to do the same thing and really hoping alts get their day again. But I'm trying to be careful and only go into alts with a "future". So I think while the train is whistlin' I better stack up and hope one day this year we'll start seeing what we saw Q4 2017.

How did you not make enough in 2017 to end the recklessness / delayed bills, etc?
