There is a section in the tipping bar that will display a note from the publisher.
A publisher can paste their bitcoin wallet address in that area and users can copy that to their own wallet and send a tip that way.
"hey we have a browser with adblock preinstalled, then you buy tokens and pay publishers to not have ads!!!" OR you just use an adblocker... wtf?
You have demonstrated that you have no idea whatsoever how that bat ecosystem works. I suggest you spend some time on google getting educated before you comment in future.
The only people who buy tokens are advertisers. They buy BAT so they can then spend to show ads to Brave users who OPT-IN to the Brave ads program. Users are then rewarded BAT for allowing a small number of ads to be displayed as notifications in their browser.
Regular users can also buy additional BAT if they want to be a larger contributor to their favorite publisher. A bit like when people donate 10 bucks each month to a patreon account. But they are under no obligation to do so, this is just for users who are generous and willingly able to donate to their favorite content producers.
After a user accumulates BAT, they can either spend it themselves, or they can reward some of their favorite publishers or YouTubers.
The Brave browser is centered around privacy and making being subjected to ads online an OPT-IN decision, rather than constantly fighting to OPT-OUT of advertisements.

Unpopular opinion.
I’m going to play devils advocate here, but first let me say that I’m not a supporter of Craig and I think he’s a cunt, but what if Craig was the guy who wanted to make an e cash clone that he could sell to online casinos for a few hundred k.
We all know he’s incompetent with code, but that does not mean he can’t come up with ideas. So what if he went looking for some guys to do all the heavy lifting with his e cash idea, but the guy he found to do the work then turned it into something revolutionary.
Then, Craig being the leech he is, just piggybacked it all the way and got other more intelligent people to do the work.
Then, what if one of the brains of the operation dies and the other one goes dark and you are now in a position to claim the creation as your own. But there are lots of gaps to fill. So he faked a load of stuff, but did it poorly.
Last week I read an interesting article that kind of backs up some of Craig’s claims. You can read it here - 
u/scronty 
After reading the article I had 2 thoughts. First was that he might well have been paid a hefty sum of money by Craig to create this elaborate story that half backs up Craig’s claim, while still throwing shade on Craig, so as to not seem overly positive of him and less likely to be called out as a plant.
The other outcome is that Satoshi was 3 people, Craig was one of those people with access to the handle, but was intellectually challenged on the subject and only posted vetted content on behalf of the 2 real brains, Dave Kleiman and Phil Wilson.
Hal Finney would later take the place of Phil Wilson.
Before you shower me in downvotes, read the link I posted above and then let me know your thoughts.

“people just dont pay for digital information that isn't subscription based like netflix or spotify offer.”
If that were true then sites like patreon.com wouldn’t be so popular.
“This idea of paying publishers for not showing ads”
Nobody is paying publishers to not show ads. They can still use Google Adsense. BAT is a way for publishers to monetize their visitors who ARE using Adblock, in the form of the Brave browser and not a browser extension in chrome or Firefox.
This means publishers actually earn more because they are now monetizing a previously impossible audience.

Reminds me of an old scam. 
A guy would email a million people and tell half of them that team A would win and email the other half that team B would win.
Then after the game, he would email all the winning predictions and tell 250,000 of them the result of the next game would be team A, then email the other 250,000 that team B would win.
This would continue a few more times until they have a pool of about 50,000 people who all received accurate predictions. Then the scammer would email those people and tell them the next prediction would cost them $20.
Even if only 1000 people took the bait. That’s $20,000 for sending out a few email blasts.
Easiest money ever made.

Brave browser already lets publishers put other addresses in the tipping banner.
So this version that gab is working on is pointless and I’m calling bullshit on it right now. 
All brave needs to do is add in an option for multiple text boxes with a little drop down menu and let publishers add multiple coin addresses and they will completely negate the efforts of gab.
Fuck those guys. Brave has already built an awesome ecosystem and it’s going to take a miracle for this gab project to get even close to the current user base that brave has. By which time, brave will have grown ten fold.
I wouldn’t touch the gab project with a shitty barge pole.

I had to keep a 25% rolling reserve for 6 months when I was using PayPal a few years back.
That basically means that 25% of all payments had to be left in my account for 6 months before I could withdraw them to my bank.
That was almost my entire profit margin being held ransom by PayPal for 6 months while I worked my ass off for no returns.
Don’t even get me started on their fees. Fuck PayPal.
