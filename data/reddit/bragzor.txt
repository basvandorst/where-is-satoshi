Not the kind of intrinsic I'm talking about, and being the best known crypto-currency is like being the smartest kid in special ed.


I'm sorry, but that's just wrong. The facts are not supporting your assertions.


First of all, you're talking about USD. Don't assume that everyone is American or as anglocentric as you seem to be. Secondly, printing money is part of the regulation. The USD might have lost value, but it didn't lose half its value overnight twice last year, unlike some other currency.


That's not saying much. Separated from the real world, all currencies are stable. Stability is always in comparison to something else.
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:25:55
I think we get your point, but the USD is used all over the world, and it has just as much intrinsic value as BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:57:06


I know how you're feeling. I truly do.


I know, but most bitcoin aficionados usually don't seem to have realise that it is, so I thought it proper to mention it. I also don't think that it's either helpful, nor very mature to make up silly nicknames for normal currencies, but that's another story.


Which is why it's not ready *yet* to be beneficial to societies. Bitcoins today are little more than a vessel for speculation, but more and more actual services acknowledge it, and one day, it might actually have an inherit usefulness that is not just based on speculation. 


Generally fairly well actually. I know it's not a popular opinion in this age of anti-establishmentarism, but no market to date has managed to regulate itself, so you have to be pretty damn gullible to believe that the next one will.


I don't think I am. I see people, the vast majority of which have basically no idea how the real world works, hyping it as the second coming of God, and I'm constantly baffled by the blindness of their faith. I'm sure some people really see the true possibilities, and there truly are some, but they are not the most vocal ones, and might be a minority.


In absolute numbers, no doubt. Absolutely no frickin' doubt. Relatively... not really.

Where did he ask people to stop using bitcoins? Jesus, you really can't take even reasonable criticism of bitcoin, can you? Better sweep all complaints under the rug. After all, need for improvement is a sign of weakness, and that's not acceptable.

Those are not intrinsic values, they are just properties, some of which they even share with bank notes.

What makes you think inflation is something you battle? It's not even a bad thing if kept in check. It's simply a re-evaluation of the worth of the market the currency represent in relation to the amount of currency available. Inflation, or the possibility of it, is actually good for a market since it discourages sitting on your money and spend as little as possible.

What are you basing that assessment on?


If it still hasn't been fixed, then it's clearly a valid complaint.


Seems to me like this is what he complained about. The attitude of the supporters. The people who should show the world how great bitcoin is, but who instead are scaring people away. It is worse here on Reddit than in some other forums, but the bitcoin community is pretty obnoxious, and off-putting. So much so that it's probably preventing some people from taking the first step.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:45:03
Actually, that would make it a conspiracy hypothesis.
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:06:02


I'm not talking about "other people". I'm talking about being helpful for the economy of a country. It's obvious that it's (un)stable enough for some people. I'm not trying to refute that.


No, because it's considered an asset. If you own a gold ring, you don't continuously pay capital gains tax on increases in the value of gold. It's really not that hard to understand if you try.
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:29:08
I'm not sure Bitcoin will be a boon to any economy any time soon. It's simply too volatile. I don't really see the problem with it being treated as an asset.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:22:08


But that's only one way to have inflation. The other is decreased production. The first is much easier to prevent, though I'll admit that it's often not.


That doesn't mean that it's not being saved. It might just means that some people made money on bitcoin and are spending more than they would if they hadn't. A very large part of all bitcoins have not been traded in a very (relatively off course) long time.


Saving is positive on a personal level, but it's not positive for a society. It's dead money. It's not doing anything.


I don't think you can draw conclusions at this point. The usage of bitcoin as a currency used for trade is still marginal at this point. It's also mainly used by people who are already very invested in the technology, meaning they do not represent your average user. In the end, I see no reason to, at this time, believe that people would react to differently to deflation depending on what flavour of fiat it is traded in. I'd also say that deflation as a result of increased production is not only good, but necessary for a healthy economy. That might not be the case with bitcoin though, since its worth is not based in anything tangible.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:50:33
If the whole 700,000 bitcoins lost-thing is a lie, then it's a text-book example of FUD. Adding details to that would be just as much FUD, if unintentional.

First of all, it *is* a fiat currency in that it lacks intrinsic value. Secondly, what does it matter if it's a protocol? All the features it offer are (and have been for a long time) available for any transaction through other means.


Maybe, maybe not. Stability is not something that comes by automation. The government-backed currencies are manipulated to keep them stable and counteract speculation. What governing body will do that to for bitcoins? Or is the idea that it will regulate itself? :)
All the dogma and blind adoration aside, what's the problem with bitcoins (and other crypto-currencies of which there a dozens by now) playing by the same rules as other assets? If they can't compete under equal conditions, then they can't really compete at all.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:26:34

So the identifier can't be used as an identifier, and instead you're supposed to use the amount, address, and timestamp? As far as I can tell that's not even a unique identifier, so how is this not a problem with the protocol?

He's most likely not working for Russia directly (anymore), but he has a political bias that he pushes, and it very much works in Russia favour. Like many other here (mostly American by the look of it) he does defend Russia from time to time. It seemed to peak in the aftermath of Snowden, and Russia perhaps looking like his best way out of his legal situation. That's also when he had his show on RT. Sorry for not having any solid evidence either way, but there probably wouldn't be any of it was true anyway.

And how many of those investing in bitcoins are "crypto experts"? Very few I would imagine. Luckily you don't actually have to be a crypto expert to trade with crypto currencies since they are traded just like any other form of goods. Besides, the crypto aspect of it isn't even all that complicated. Mostly just a liberal use of SHA-256 (thanks NSA!).

I have no problems with that kind of faith. I do have one with dismissing people because they aren't "crypto experts", when what you need to succeed in the current market is to be a trade/investment expert. That is, after all, the primary usage of Bitcoin today. That said, I think most of us are very interested in seeing what happens when the lightning network is finally ready.

Hate to be a pedant, but "the net" refers to the Internet, a term coined in the early to mid 80s. What you're referring to is the World Wide Web. That is *not* the Internet, but a layer built on top of it. In the Application layer to be precise.

@_date: 2013-12-18 00:10:22


It allows you to communicate in real time over vast distances. It revolutionised the way in which we interact when it was first introduced.


bla entrenched bla bla petrified bla.... yeah that's a nice mantra, but how is it not a fiat currency? Have you looked up the definition?


It's not though, and even if it was, there's still other forces that can manipulate it.


Actually, it seems to me that it favours fevered speculation by inexperienced traders, which in and of itself makes it useless for any operator that could otherwise have considered to offer products for it. Since you can barely buy anything for it, I assume it does, in at least one way, encourages saving.
