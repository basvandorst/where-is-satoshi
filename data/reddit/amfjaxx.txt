I’ll give some insight once I turn my transactions over to bitcoin tax, I’m on the hook for about 300k this year :)

Just wait until futures start trading on the NYSE, bitcoin 12k by the end of the year, 45k by the end of next year.

anything you want to know about crypto currencies you can find on U tube. Its full of information. Just make sure your viewing the ones put on by the actual companies and be careful of the ones by the average joe just putting in his two cents. Those are still good for different prospectives but not knowing if that person has stake in the game can mean they are bias.

I got into the market in January of 2016, two of my teammates that I work with got me in around that time, they both got in on ethereum during its ico. They are both millionaires now. I'm sitting on 500 ethereum, 1 million digibyte, 500k ripple, and 500k in sia coin.  Everything  I have in play now is the houses money. This gives me a little edge because now I can take some risks. Ethereum is my safe bet, in the long run that will continue to grow higher and higher. Digibyte I'm guessing will take a couple years depending on what happens this winter at their next conference. From the readings I'm looking at now, ripple should start making some moves in 2018, so I'm let's give it 7 months from now to see where it's at. Sia coin is my day trading stock, I'm only in it to double my money on the next rise and get out, then I turn around and buy low when the market comes back down. I have sell orders placed with ethereum and digibyte just in case they get to where I'll start selling them. Coinigy is a great day trading site, even long term, free for the first month then there is a fee but you can make that back easy. Hope this helps, this is what I am currently invested in, at .45 cents I'd even buy back into the new storj if I had the extra money.

I got into crypto's in 2016. My teammates and i spent quite a bit of time looking at the backgrounds of each of these cryptos(Looked at the CEO's to see who they were and what programs if any that they have been with, and what if any products they had come out with before.) and took in account what their tech could do for the world and the likelihood that tech could succeed. I started with 2k, and instantly caught the bug,eventually i got up to 20k invested in the markets. I watch the market cap every day and depending on that number decides on whether i look at my crypto's. From my experiences, its going to take a few ups and downs before you know when the best time to buy and sell. If you peak into the market everyday you will start to see a coins high and low and eventually know when its time to sell and then buy again. You have to have the balls to stay in it for the long haul sometimes, for instance my 20k at one point during the 3 month uptick of crypto's was worth 550k at one point; Of course everyone wanted to ride it as far as they could and i was wanting to hold all my crypto's for at least a year. Well the market cap during that time went from 65billion to 120 billion and the drop took it back down to 65billion again to where my totals where about 120k. That's over a 300k loss, but i didn't sell, i knew the market would come back because i believe in what this technology can do for the world. This was a huge learning point. Now it made me think about the next uptick and what cryptos i wanted to hang onto and which ones i could let go to start making profits. So when the market went to 176billion the on the next big upswing i chose to sell one of my crypto's at that point because i new it would reset again and i didn't want to get greedy this time. I sold my SJCX(STORJ) and made 270k. Just some free info here, it took me 9 hours to sell 181k shares Between 1.75 and 1.35. its high was 2.20 but i was not able to get to my computer before it started back down. I guess my point to the story is, its a roller coaster. When your going up, everything is cool and easy, when your going down it rattles the shit out of you. When you come in after its all over, its either a good ride or a bad one, but then you get off and go looking for the next experience. Imagine being the guy that doesn't even get on the ride!

Many of the coins out there are just copy cat coins. As far as a fraud....i have made some good money doing my do diligence and researching my coins. Your first hint that cryptos are a big deal is when you have JP Morgan trying to manipulate the market so they can get into it at a lower price. That is a Huge Sign that cryotos are here to stay!
