But if adopting the name really matters that much, isn't it possible that bitcoin is likewise overhyped because of its name?
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:24:09
Is something wrong with Cobinhood that makes this bigger news? I know they don't really do cash deposits yet but it seems like they have a better coin selection and no fees.
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:28:16
I would agree. Also, I think the interface is going to be killer once the new updates come out.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:32:47
May I ask what exactly you mean by this?
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:59:39
So what would be a good wallet or type of wallet to use for maintaining privacy?
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:30:24
Really? It seems like I'm paying closer to $1 when I transfer from my Circle account to Bitcoin Wallet. Or could that just be some type of market fluctuation?
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:03:50
Damn. Well a higher exchange rate would scale similarly so I'm guessing that's just standard across the market?
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:05:44
Oh wow. Thank you, stranger!
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:58:42
So maybe I should find another service for exchanges of higher value?
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:53:31
Am I able to use Circle in the same manner as other wallets in terms of anonymity? Or am I overestimating the powers of encryption?
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:48:48
Ah thank you
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:44:35
This makes sense. And I just realized I can transfer my circle funds into bitcoin for free.
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:22:01


I'm not sure why you think this doesn't make stealing bitcoin illegal.


This is also true when you do this with cash, unless you can actually prove that it is yours or that an agreement was in place.


Same is true if you happen to find someone else's cash on the ground or even steal it and the other party can't prove that they owned the cash in the first place.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:26:36
You realize that stealing btc is still a crime, right?..
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:53:48


Actually I believe it is legally closer to buying a store of value in which that value is the only thing you eventually get to possess, like company stocks or retirement accounts. 


I'm not sure how you can confidently make this statement. I think that at best, you can say this could be true if either the understanding of crypto, coin vetting, or the crpto/fiat exchange interaction for the end user are not improved, but otherwise, exchanges aren't even that bad today and they've been improving for years. Hell, this is as anecdotal as most bad cases I'll see on here, but I've been using crypto for years without any serious issue.


Maybe, but I think it's only important that the government view it as legal property and allow it to grow. Regulation would also be appreciated.


I'm not sure why this is your go to but alright. I'm not for communism at all, but I definitely do not have enough information on it to claim that it couldn't work in some context.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:32:46
Seeing a handful of anecdotal cases like this and using them as evidence to suggest that all of crypto is bad is just making a poor argument. Also, crypto is property. It's not like it isn't legally protected from theft.
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:14:52
[Totally not illegal](
[No laws on the books at all](
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:39:05


Oh... the Cryptsy people though? Oh he went an started a new scam company, ok...


Last I heard Mark Karpelès might get $1 billion and did a reddit AMA...
Ah, I forgot that things aren't illegal if someone isn't actually caught and arrested every time they occur. Oh wait... That's a terrible argument.


At least this part is true.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:24:37
Do you think that crypto doesn't count as legal property?..
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:01:37
Can someone please explain this to me?
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:37:04
Well shit, don't be selfish. Share your insider secrets.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:05:44
You claimed that ethereum isn't viable as its essentially coasting on the coat-tails of bitcoin. That is not a reason for something to fail.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:55:03
I mean, maybe. But it doesn't sound like you have anything to back that claim. Can't really take credit for calling it if you're just tossing shit at a wall and hoping it sticks.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:31:46
Oh I know it's a troll. I just have some spare time between sets at my gym and was admittedly having fun with it. I appreciate you looking out all the same.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:41:02
I just want you to give me some numbers. Anything that isn't just some opinion piece that says that ethereum is set to fail.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:49:17
Coke was born out of the desire to create a cough syrup. That doesn't sound like a reason so much as a guess.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:24:06
Back to claiming that it's common knowledge? Yeah, those experts on the market are just blind sheep and you've got all the answers. And what you've said is that you have no actual reason to believe your own statement. I was honestly hoping you had some substance to your argument.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:56:42
Of course. Your opinion is likely unique and completely self-formed, so you couldn't possibly just link a few articles referencing your key points or anything. I'm sure I might simply misunderstand whatever you post anyway. Still, I would be very appreciative.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:59:21
Well you also don't really seem to have a reason to believe your own claim. Honestly, why would a market not be viable just because it was derived from a stronger market? This just looks like a blanket guess and it's demonstrably wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:15:03


@_date: 2017-08-11 14:08:48
This is an answer I was looking for. Thank you. Though can a smart contract easily become too large to quickly process by a single node?
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:44:41
I don't mean the price tickers. Just some data that actually says ethereum is set to fail. Or feel free to point out what you feel to be a systemic flaw in ethereum that isn't present in bitcoin. Without either of these, there simply is no argument to be had here.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:39:37
It's public knowledge that one of the strongest altcoins is sure to tank?..
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:18:41
Feel free to explain the difference to my tiny brain then, bud. Because so far, you've said nothing with anymore substance than "I'm completely guessing but feel very strongly about my guess."
@_date: 2016-11-09 23:29:50
I also would like my free money please.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:48:46
You're the one spending time on reddit claiming ethereum to be a failing coin. I'll happily turn around and support your claims if I see some data. Otherwise, nothing at all.
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:33:54
Thanks for taking light-hearted ribbing much more seriously than necessary.

@_date: 2017-08-10 15:29:29
I have the current market to back up my claims. The current state of ethereum is marked by consitent growth up to this point. You've given me nothing to suggest a change in that regard. And, I agree, markets can be irrational, but its completely irrational to simply believe that to be the way they'll behave.
@_date: 2017-04-12 16:33:52
I'm not really seeing many trolls though. Just differing opinions mostly.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:40:30


If we do get truly decentralized exchanges, I believe you are correct that those would be difficult to fully tax. Though if they really wanted to, they could restrict access to the site within the US if it refused to pay taxes. Still, I'm not sure the government would need to even try as long as fiat currencies remain the standard, as you still have to convert back to purchase almost anything. And if crypto does take over (as I'm hoping it will), then many more points of sale will be available for the government to tax.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:34:27
Regulation =/= Centralization
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:16:56


I actually mine coins... I also have to fill out tax paperwork as an LLC because I do this. Does my filing taxes with the governent somehow centralize crypto?


This is just incorrect. There are several levels at which the goverment can regulate crypto, but the easiest would be at the level of financial returns. And as I mentioned, they already do this as of this year.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:07:15
That would be nice, but I still see this as an easy target for regulation. All the government would have to do is tax certain types of transactions performed on the exchange and make that exchange responsible for them. The exchange would likely then distribute that expense to its participants using a fee system. And if you're thinking that the exchange could avoid taxes by not being based in the US, I'm afraid that would be overly optimistic. Still, I think my point stands that regulation does not have to be implemented through blockchain control and thus is not necessarily centralization.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:28:28


Well for one thing, if you mine with a pool and are a US resident, that pool is required to make you file as an LLC if you earn over a certain amount. Otherwise, it is allowed to halt your deposits until you do. Beyond that, if you earn enough money and cannot account for it on your taxes, prepare to get audited.


They regulate the exchanges and their participants.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:51:50
Yeah, I had a feeling that's what you meant. That is more like a less centralized exchange than a decentralized exchange (which may actually be an oxymoron). If you're recording transactions through a website and giving that website your personal info, that money is still very easy to tax and regulate.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:53:42
Easy. Centralization is a system in which utilization or transfer of a resource is performed through a small amount of third party entities (Visa, MasterCard, etc.). And regulations are just sets of rules by which all participants in a certain market must abide. You aren't moving money through the government just because the government puts rules in place for the companies through which you move your money. In fact, regulation is often needed to prevent centralization. The act of "trust busting" is literally decentralization through regulation.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:04:54
Governments are not decentralized but a government imposing regulations doesn't actually mean a resource would be moving through the government. 
If it's btc, then I would hope you know where that money is made and how it is controlled.
 And I literally used two banks as examples of centralization...
And decentralization through regulation is literally what trust busting is...
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:40:02
Have you ever mined before?... It is pretty much irrelevant if a pool is based in the US or not. If that pool functions in the US at all (and it would have to if I were using it), then it is fully susceptible to US law in any way that concerns me. Also, in order to mine in any pool I've ever been a part of, I've had to provide a copy of my driver's license as well as some personal info just to get started. 


What does this even mean?
Furthermore, I'm not claiming that regulation at this level would allow the government to grab every single penny out of crypto to which it believes that it is entitled. I'm just saying that this is a perfectly plausible level at which they can and do regulate crypto without actually centralizing it.
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:29:53
I did say that they should educate themselves... Regardless, bitcoin is inevitably going to have to answer to the end user if it wants to continue to grow and prosper. If a redditor can understand how a technical change will affect their personal experience with bitcoin, they should be allowed to have a say in the matter.
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:16:30
Maybe. But if a common redditor takes the time to educate his/herself, the opinion shouldn't just be thrown out because they aren't among the "elite."
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:06:40
Which is going to make it centralized if you ignore the opinion of the user...
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:08:56
Why not listen to both?..
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:57:04
...and end users.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:30:26
It does have that weird little cross though.
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:08:04
Are you a heavy advocate for massive block sizes or something? I ask as you seem to want nothing but centralized input. The end user has to have a say in bitcoin because the end user is the person to whom bitcoin must be marketed if we want it to continue to grow. That's just how it works.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:28:08
I'm saying that I'd prefer to see ideas turned down with other ideas rather than status.
