"If, BTC teaches $33k, my house is paid off. Success! If it reaches $115k, I'm retired. Success!"
I understand the logic, just make sure you have an exit strategy now. As things get irrational in the future it will be nice to have a plan defined in a time of clarity. If Bitcoin reaches, $33k it is not "success" unless you use it to pay off the house. What if you are hodling for your retirement number and it crashes? Just something to consider. Which are you aiming for? If retirement is there a way to take some profits before then and still reach your retirement number? Maybe by the time BTC can pay off the house your number needed for retirement is lower

What would give you that idea? Other than the fact that he dumped all of his coins? ��

My situation is similar. I bought on May 2nd and it said arriving May 8th. Still waiting

Awesome, thank you for following up! Hoping to turn it into XRP on gatehub while it's still pulled back in price

So there is still open the possibility of hard fork in November right? Even if this does get locked in for August?

So what I was saying is it only matters the price when I purchased the contract. If I pay $100 for a mining contract when the price per BTC was $2500 then I could have alternatively bought 0.04 BTC. So long as my contract eventually produces more than 0.04 BTC then it was the smarter decision. Price fluctuations in the future will effect either method of obtaining Bitcoin equally. Does that make sense.
In other words, if you feel BTC is at a low current price it probably makes more sense to buy it straight up. This is why I recommended to friends not buy BTC contracts when it was under $2k last week. But if say it's $3k tomorrow, I'd probably say maybe a mining contract is more attractive. Of course there's other factors too. If the price is rocketing up, more people will probably be buying contracts and starting to mine again in general so the payouts may lower

That's why they set a threshold for larger less frequent payments. I've been using Genesis for almost a month. I don't look at return on investment as being when I make my dollar amount back but when I receive the amount of ETH and BTC that I could have purchased at current price when the contracts were purchased. It appears like it will take 6 months. I can see how much they have generated for me but none of it has been sent to my external wallet yet. I think of it like an annuity. I'm slowly building ammo that I cannot touch for a while. Not for everyone, but nothing about it has seemed like a scam so far
