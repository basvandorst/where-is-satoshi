How does it encourage mining pool to cluster together ?

So when they remine the chain they don’t need to wait 10min between each bloc ?

But you see, at the same time, bitpay wallet private key were stolen because the wallet was open source, some guy modify one of the library they were using to build the wallet, to steal the key

Which part is not open source ?
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:26:54
That my opinion, but as I say I’m not a security expert. I heard that some people say that none-open source can be a layer of security because it’s harder to find bugs 
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:06:33
Yes it make sense, thank you for your answer

It’s not true, bitcoin won’t be stable in price during time. It’s gonna take value in long term beacause it’s scarce, so it won’t be stable. If you take a look à the price of gold, it’s not stable, between 2008 and 2012 the price double, between 2013 and 2014 the price lost 30%. What I mean is even with a huge market cap, it will be more stable, but not stable

Because in this none state currency, Hayek consider that the currency that would be choose by people is the one who is the more stable. And, to do that the bank who issue the private currency will play with the quantity of money and the loan to inflate or deflate the currency, this is not the case in bitcoin, we cannot extend the supply when the price rise, we can’t reduce it when it drops.
