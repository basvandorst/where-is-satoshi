Can i have a bitcoin daddy

Guys please help this poor student!
I need to get a contention about Bitcoin for which I have to make debate about it, 2 arguments for the contention and 2 arguments against it. 
But what is a good contention? I want to steer it into innovation. My first contention was "Bitcoin is a bubble" which was very one sided and too speculative. 
I was thinking about:
"Bitcoin has great innovative potential" However it is obvious that it has innovative potential thus its not a great contention. Could you guys help me finding a good contention which is backed up by a lot of articles and research perhaps! 
Thank you in advance!

Shouldve waited! Its usual, some sort of self fulfulling prophecy that traders are selling just before the Christmas holidays.

Lets be real guys, straight up. It's only going downhill from now or the price will stay stable at 7k/8k.

Hey guys! 
I was wondering if its too late to invest in Bitcoin.. thinking about investing 300 € and leaving it there for quite some time until. 
Is it a good moment to invest? Thank you in advance!

Thank you sir! How long should I hold? Literally years? And how much is wise? I got 4k in my savings..
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:20:37
Do you reckon it will go back to 20k any time soon?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:21:27
Realistically speaking, this is the beginning of the end? People are getting too scared and the possible sanctions by governments..

this hurts
