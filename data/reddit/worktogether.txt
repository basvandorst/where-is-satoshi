I wasn't around for tulips, but it feels more like an apt analogy since there were so many different baseball cards to collect, but only one tulip
Baseball cards were worth something until they printed so many they became worthless, similar to crypto

Good, I'm glad there aren't any other cryptos besides bit coin
I'm glad there aren't literally 100s of other crypto currencies that would make my analogy invalid

DUh crashes mean permanently down, by definition!
So crazy no wonder this thing went to the moon, people buying don't even know what words mean 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:01:35
So basically, your pride being hurt, is worse than losing cash

Good companies do survive, but it may be 10 years before the stock comes back to bubble highs

The results of the only poll that matters is the price of bitcoin on any day
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:18:46
My gut feeling is that everyone is about to use bitcoin cause it's see easy to understand and use per your example above
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:44:24
Mt Gox 2.0?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:32:06
Why wouldn't people wait till 2018 when taxes are lower to realize gains?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:29:30
I'm new to this and thinking about getting in if it goes wayyy down
But I got on one website and I kid you not there was like 30 different coins to check charts on
I liked the idea of bitcoin having a cap on new money, but with so many different coins there really is no cap, plus I'm sure all these alt coins are diluting the market
I guess whichever coins become the easiest to use or are adopted by the most people will become the most valuable
My guess it will be some new coin made by Visa or similar that have an infrastructure in place to accept said coins
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:14:23
I don't get it
That last leg ain't happening
The fact that you're talking about noob traders should be a sell signal
When the noobs get involved that's when the big money sells
The big money moves the markets

So you think the two weeks worth of investors that could have realized losses are selling to realize those losses to write that off and that is what pushed down the market? 
The market topped two weeks ago, they started selling at the top of the market to lock in losses before the end of the year
Makes no sense
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:30:55
Pretty sure that's illegal
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:09:26
They sell futures now, I think that makes it equivelent to Stocks 
But I don't know

Would not "whales" be the people that have the most bitcoin? Would not those same people be large miners? 
WHY THE FUCK WOULD MINERS WANT A LOWER PRICE FOR WHAT THEY MINE????
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:01:06


Logic is rock solid
Simply, People that own bitcoin are selling more than people are buying
My point was that people here say that whales are manipulating the price down. why the fuck would people that own and mine BTC manipulate the price of their asset to be worth less
Jesus 
 Your part of the crazy and stupid you mentioned
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:01:23
Bitcoin is fiat
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:46:43
That doesn't make any sense, if bitcoin keeps all time highs it will be the hot topic
They say sell when everyone else is buying, and buy when everyone else is selling
The fact that I am here reading this, some regular old guy, should tell you all you need to know
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:18:30
To the people cheerleading, the opposite of FUD
I ask you, tether, lighting, block chains, electronic wallets, coins diverging to different coins
Do you really think the average joe is going to use this as currency? Moms and dads ? Grandparents? 
I think maybe 20 years from now, that's a long time to wait and by then don't you think some other coin created by Visa or MasterCard, organizations with the infra structure in place to perform transactions fast and safely will have created their own coins?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:55:54
Maybe 10-15 years some digital currency will do what you hope
With like 1200 digital currencies I hope for you're sake BYC is the one that makes it
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:25:36
I hear this a lot, that people are are glad the weak hands sold, its healthy for the market
If you knew there were so many weak hands why not sell before them and buy back more when the market was "healthy"?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:30:44
That crash had nothing to do with faith in currencies or the markets and everything to do with people getting loans to buy houses they couldn't afford

Troll question: I've been on vacation for a week and I check and BTC Is down 15%
Yet everyone here is super hype on it
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:31:35
Dumb, you clearly already did the research, as you stated before 
Just click send 
Unless your full of shit
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:26:28
Slowest method
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:04:07
lots of sellers on the sidelines
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:35:32
too slow that way
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:48:32
Noob question
How much does bitcoin pay in dividends?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:56:58
What CAUSED the loss of faith in digital currencies?
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:10:49
Nocoiners can own coins, er I mean, Internet points 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:13:05
hes not selling until he loses 30%, I assume thats his goal
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:58:14
I'd wager the people cheerleading this most complicated of currencies, are still up on their investment, they look at their beanie babies and say to themselves well I'm still up so I made a good investment, bitcoin is still all good
The people selling are those who are down
As the price continues to go down the cheer leaders will turn to sellers
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:15:07
I'm talking about that bubble graph people have been linking to, that describes bubble phsycology, have you seen it?
The shit is real
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:08:30
Did BTC miss earnings estimates, is that why they are down?
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:30:54
Its not, the last dip below $8K might have been
 but this one aint
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:00:28
I'm not seeing despair yet, so this isn't the bottom
Until all lose hope then we will see a bottom
Too many people with hope here
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:22:41
Noob question, how much interest do the exchanges pay on bitcoin in their wallets?
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:41:25
When does BTC report earnings?
I'm expecting that the next earnings report will beat Wall Street expectations and send the shorts running for cover!!
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:23:53
Nocoiner here with a question, what does the term nocoiner mean?
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:13:40
Cool thanks, so simple
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:32:22
Who cares use the SPY then
Same bet still applies
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:33:09
So you lose $1000 every 5 min for the last 2 months?
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:49:00
Good fucking analogy I like
In other words it's backed by its usefulness
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:44:01
My bet is that you're holding because you are still up overall on you investment
Am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:29:06
CTRL C CTRL V is still typing
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:34:39
Wtf this is why you invest?
Basically you need sheep?
