Any time you hear the term "virtual currency" being used just walk away or kindly tell them "Not all things digital are a virtual something."
I don't even own any fraction of a BTC and this is one of those little errors or intentional fallacies that makes me say "Fuck this gay earth".

people shouldn't be down-voting this just because they disagree with it

It should be glaringly obvious, especially when you *read the list they provide*, that they want to subvert other government's internet surveillance of citizens and not their own. They advertise that their for free speech but they don't really believe in it. This is a diplomatic/military tactic not a altruistic gesture. It's really disgusting and infuriating because it's like having them lie to you when they know that you know that they're lying but some other idiots in the room don't.

You donate to an organization because you believe in the cause/agenda they (will) perpetuate. Wikipedia runs servers and they provide (vis-a-vis "give") *access to knowledge which other people have already donated* to them; so, we would be donating money to maintain access to information/editorial/administration donations they have already received. I believe the feat which Wikipedia has achieved is great indeed but if they don't accept bitcoin, just as if they wouldn't accept certain bits of information (let's say about cancer research in case you need an example), then I don't fully believe in their cause.

So this is public exchange of keys (public key or private key), not public key exchange?

I nominate [this as the best given explanation]( Most people asking these questions probably don't even know how any of the money we use today works and the phenomena of Bitcoin just introduces a bunch of new ideas into older ones which nobody has the 1st clue about to begin with. 
Baby steps must be taken.
The most relevant, practical, and generalized facts about Bitcoin to anyone and everyone is that they're decentralized, finite, and very-difficult/impossible to counterfeit. These ideas need to be under-explained, not over-explained. If people are genuinely curious they'll ask follow up questions and that's the opportunity to introduce more detail or to talk about individual subjects.

lol that's a doozy. I'd think mainstream economists are a bit more like climate change deniers if I even believed that anthropogenic climate change was real and what you were talking about. Despite the fact that we might not agree on which side of the status quo 'climate change denial' falls on I think it should be obvious who is like what in terms of *reckless growth*.
