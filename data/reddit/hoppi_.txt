Neither own an Apple product nor own any BTC but this was really captivating nonetheless. Well done. :)

... guys, could you also say why this was so "downvote-worthy"? Imho it's a bit odd to have 13 upvotes and downvotes. I'm a bit curious about that.  But pretty sure the post isn't that "controversial". It's only reddit...

Did I get this right? If they see someone buying hardware that can be used for bitcoin related stuff (such as mining), they are going to terminate you? This is nuts.

Thank you for answering, that was really interesting to read.


Yup, pretty much. I mean, I figured bitcoin's worth in USD fluctuates obviously, so that's why I drew some analogies from that... kind of.


Interesting, that is indeed a good normal use then. Wouldn't have thought that one can already make real-world purchases wit hit.
I wish you the best of success with your company!

Oh ok, I see. Thanks for clarifying.

Thanks for your reply.
But I suppose that's not the norm, right? So since mining apparently got really hard and it's tough to get profitable with it (based on what I've read), does it end with you trading on a daily basis? Or every 2 days maybe?
