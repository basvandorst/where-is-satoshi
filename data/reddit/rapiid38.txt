I don't disagree with that but saying 'don't risk more than you can lose' is very different to saying 'bitcoin is a bubble' in other words 'bitcoin has no  value/less value'.
In effect these comments influence the price and distort your 'reasonable risk' estimate.

I've heard this too many fucking times, if it is then it will pop and you don't need to say anything, if it isn't then you're just drumming up more volatility. Stop it, it's pointless.

Assuming that's even their intention, if they're such esteemed experts then why has the drug war had such disastrous results?


Depends on the substance/amount, some people just need a small amount of weed for insomnia, some people take LSD/Mushrooms for depression, some people need concentrated THC oil &amp; some people need kratom to kick their opiate habit which is blanket banned in the UK and since it's not worth it for street dealers, 99% of access is cut off.
So there is a range from warnings to confiscation to criminal charges to complete inaccessibility.
If you think everyone who needs/wants an illegal drug for their condition can simply just go and get what they need off the street at a fair price, know it's safe &amp; don't really have to worry about law enforcement then it just shows how ignorant you are on this subject &amp; frankly I find it abhorrent that you would profess this ignorance to maintain the current situation when people are suffering because they can't/are too afraid to obtain what they need to be healthy.
It's truly disgusting.


Muh drug dealers are evil shadowy hooded figures that carry guns and hang around dark alleyways looking to commit their next satanic ritual.
Actually they're just normal people like you and me and generally have no ill-will, they just want to provide people with value, [here in the UK it's not uncommon for "grandma's" to run grow operations.](
Doesn't look like a "nasty person" to me.


Surprisingly they are uninformed and I contest that they have the right to make those decisions for me.
If you think they do hold that right, then that's fine. But I do not care. I will continue to break the law thus rendering "society's decision" pointless, in fact they already are pointless, I can order virtually any drug I want to right now, worry free, thanks to Ross.
Society's decision doesn't matter when it's unenforceable and we have demonstrated that this is the case. We've already won.


No, the FBI decided they wanted to steal some bitcoins.


I have read Rousseau, I have been politically active for many years, it is possible to read something &amp; disagree.

If you want those laws you can have them, in your own society, that you voluntarily agree to.
Do not force your opinions about what I should/shouldn't consume on me &amp; if you try to then we will disobey anyway which makes the law pointless in the first place.

No, he passed SR onto someone else who logged in whilst he was in jail.
If he wanted to make money he would've maintained sole access.
Years before SR was ever published Ross detailed the project and his reasons for doing it on his linkedin, those reasons were a belief in Anarcho-Capitalist/free market principles.
The cunty 'judge' herself admitted that it was ideological and quoted this as a reason to enforce a harsher sentence.
You &amp; all the other trolls with (redditor for x weeks) are chatting absolute bullshit.

He didn't sell a single drug.
He didn't hire a single hitman.
He made a website &amp; people used it to sell drugs.
So basically, he made a website, life in prison... for making a website.

If government didn't monopolize everything &amp; allowed the market to compete with government operated services then I wouldn't have to rely on government.

I already explained how that's a strawman but I'll take the bait.
As opposed to what?
The current cartels that blow fucking airplanes out of the sky &amp; skin people alive?
Would I rather have a peaceful company that doesn't use any violence and simply produces cocaine efficiently and sells it to consenting adults, yes.
You call me utopian but you think lawmakers shitting a bunch of ink onto paper will just make drugs disappear, that's not how it works. This isn't fucking Narnia.

You are not god, you do not know what's best for anyone but yourself.
The idea that you protect people by giving them a criminal record, locking them up, ruining their lives &amp; restricting their access to medicine that they need is absolutely fucking laughable.


Buying and selling?! You mean voluntarily exchanging goods between consenting adults, what a horrendous crime!


You are the one trying to enforce your edicts on others, it's like a bully in a playground telling you to move to another playground if you don't wanna get smacked in the face. Your character is now utterly transparent.

Yes, it's so good for the weak citizens that we ban weed and prescribe opiates, [I've never seen them in better shape.](
But if we ever empowered the weak to make their own decisions about what they want to put into their own body, then it would just be Mad Max Somalia land, huh, oh wait, they've been able to do that for the past 8 years thanks to Ross let me just look out my window.
Nope, no mad max.

That is a strawman.
My position is that government intervention in drug use only creates more problems, I'm not saying hard drug use isn't a problem, I'm saying prohibition is a much, much worse problem. Do you see the difference?
Considering alcohol prohibition, considering marijuana prohibition, considering these events we know for a fact have had awful results that drastically improved after legalization (including usage rates going down) &amp; the fact that your position is initiatory the burden of proof is on you to prove that prohibition is a good thing instead of me to prove it's a bad thing but I digress.
Off the top of my head some of the problems:
1) Vendors under prohibition must have a violence-based OR op-sec-based business model because there is no avenue for peaceful dispute resolution (you can no longer settle disputes in the courts) and technical/manufacturing innovation ceases to occur therefor to maintain market share the vendor (now a gang) must violently seize &amp; defend territory.
2) Since technical innovation ceases to occur (because you can't have an efficient manufacturing/growing facility &amp; you are shut out of labor market) &amp; other costs rise such as the cost of smuggling due to loss of stock then prices rise, coupled with addiction this means users become impoverished and then the users also end up turning to violence to fund their addiction.
3) This causes land values to drop, homelessness, people who have never touched drugs are affected, they can't sell their house or if they do then it's at a significantly lower turnover, this creates a cycle of poverty.
4) Prison population rises to the point that prisons are at maximum capacity, a huge amount of tax payer money is then wasted to keep non-violent offenders locked up.
Not to mention that pharma is pumping out far more deadly, far more addictive LEGAL pills meanwhile most SR users were buying Weed, LSD &amp; Coke, none of these would cause you anywhere near as much harm.
You seem pretty clueless about drug use, what drugs have you done? What's your understanding of addiction?
I'm kinda wasting my time, if you didn't even know about medicinal users being criminally charged sometimes up to 40+ years, I'm not trying to insult here but you do seem totally clueless &amp; haven't done any research to know that gun sales never happened on SR like you said in the other comment thread, you've definitely never used SR or any other DNM.
It's not my job to teach you about this, you don't seem to have any experience with drugs (you're really missing out btw) can't you just be a gentleman and agree not to spout bullshit on a subject that you're clearly uninformed about?

Fuckerberg should be in there instead of Ross.
Ross was a pioneer decades ahead, a non-violent, freedom-loving, beautiful human being.
Most of the people talking shit haven't contributed a tenth of the value that Ross did to society but most importantly his arrest has done NOTHING to stop Darknet Markets, they can't be stopped but he's still sitting in a cage, why? Nothing has changed.
If he had designed his website slightly differently to be p2p like OB2, he would not be in prison. So what really is his crime? Choosing the wrong way to host some text files?
What a joke. I hope you're doing okay in there bud.

You mean when it was legal for 38 years then they banned it and usage increased tenfold?

How do you know? Considering how absolutely uninformed you've been up to this point I don't think you're in any position to make such a claim.
Besides it probably would, any USA based producer would easily out-compete them just on transportation costs alone, why do you think dispensaries in USA grow their own weed?
Just because the coca plant is from that area doesn't mean it can only be grown in that area.
Another scenario could be that coca leaves are grown there and then the raw leaves get processed elsewhere that can support the infrastructure.
