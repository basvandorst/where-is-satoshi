It’s awesome that rather than selling, you’re going to take the initiative to adopt bitcoin as a currency. Real respect. And congrats on success! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:36:41
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:29:02
Not as well as you!! Unfortunately didn’t trust my gut back in 2012...

@_date: 2017-12-06 15:21:11
so don't be stupid and don't fuck up. It's so easy not to fuck up a BTC transfer. All you need is a common sense, and don't rush it.

damn... im so spoiled by litecoin LOL
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:09:52
Through some detective work it seems that you actually have invested a substantial amount in to bitcoin... Concerned that people hear "rich" and all of a sudden jump in without knowing anything about it. BUY THE DIPS AND HODL. Does 19k sound like a dip to you? LOL
I hope I'm wrong and you didn't actually invest what looked like $100,000.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:08
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:27
States how the traffic on websites for bitcoin is so much that they can't even handle it. Says that bitcoin is dead.
Makes sense. Sounds pretty alive to me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:59:39
Most websites and transactions are slow as fuck today. Took 4 hours for my transfer out of GDAX to go through.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:42
20k before 3pm
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:42
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:27
Congratulations dude! Do whatever is best for you.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:51:10
I'm going to make a prediction that you are over the age of 35 and are stuck in the world before the internet. If not, you were raised by someone who is. Good luck successfully getting in to cryptocurrencies with such a stubborn attitude.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:58:21
OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:01:31
Bitcoin isn't a get money quick kinda thing. It's a long term investment that happens to have quick rises sometimes. If you're just looking for a quick buck, you're not going to get it with just $70.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:59:09
it's all part of the pattern my friend... 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:49:00
Until it hits 10k on bigger exchanges like GDAX, people won't say it hit 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:20:13
the mans not hot
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:44:27
i hope it's not a lot of BTC you bet... Lol you never know what's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:06:05
Lol keep telling yourself that. I don't think crypto is for you my dude.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:46:19
Same with trading stocks. Most stock trading services require identity verification. It's the same thing. Just because cryptocurrencies are new to most people doesn't mean that they don't deserve to be treated seriously. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:52:11
Could be. It just seems like GDAX is the norm for deciding when BTC hits milestones. Notice how not everyone is posting "We hit 10k". Just a few people
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:57:36
Wire transfers... Transferred money an hour ago and it's already in my GDAX account. Otherwise, those wait times are avoidable... thats what sucks about fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:21:05
Wish I was there to buy and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:12:29
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:48:59
Not many people with knowledge about bitcoin actually buy and sell on the Coinbase site, but GDAX instead.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:28:33
not sure when, but eventually, yes
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:46:48
Use GDAX. Run by Coinbase but you avoid fees.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:32:22
I've been hearing since 2013 that it's a bubble and going to crash any day. Look who is laughing now. Just some food for thought.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:02:14
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:22:08
GDAX should do just fine.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:30:57
wire transfer is quick
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:27:30
lol 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:29:17
I Pmed you
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:26:05
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:26:01
no, its fake in game currency lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:00:05
I'm not on a high horse. If you are trying to invest in bitcoin, you can't expect to make any money with $70. Thats just a fact. Also, if this guy is 18 and only has $70 to his name, he probably shouldn't put it all in to Bitcoin (especially because he probably doesn't understand it that much).
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:16:17
highly doubt it, unless it crashes obv
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:35:16
Should've hodled.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:59:49
same happened to me! congrats!
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:52:47
1. If you're only going to be trading and selling, a hardware wallet wont do you any good. Hardware wallets are best for hodling. 
2. Hodl. Don't only trade and sell, especially as a beginner.
Therefore. Get a hardware wallet. And HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:45:03
holy shit.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:44:29
correction imo
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:53:46
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:03:54
Also the fact that the moon conversion rate is a real thing is extremely amusing. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:54:17
Because without personal information, companies like Coinbase will not be able to identify any suspect. Therefore they will be shit on if they were to be hacked. They would be no more.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:45:03
With no way to trace cryptocurrency transactions, there needs to be a way for exchanges to keep track of where currency is going within the exchange. Without them keeping track of who people are, people would be constantly hacked of their savings and exchanges would have no security. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:43:14
I recommend GDAX. The way I look at it, considering it is owned by Coinbase and is probably the most widely used exchange... They have the most pressure to keep your funds secure and safe. Lol. Just wishful thinking. But for real, GDAX is my favorite. Very easy to use, minimal to no fees. Supports the main 3 currencies I'm looking to trade. If you're in to more alt coins than ETH and LTC, go for something else. Otherwise, GDAX all the way.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:18:01
Sucks being 12, hard to make money
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:28:22
for sure
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:42:02
I will accept the shame
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:55:28
how does one lose a paper wallet with 15 btc
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:03:33
shit, hitting us with the facts. Guess it's still to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:47:36
Always HODL. Always...
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:29:26
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:04:37
Is this a joke? I'm gonna lean towards yes considering your reddit username. LMFAO. Plus new account.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:30:38
Yeah, just 10 bucks... No problem with that.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:07:33
the fact that you considered that this might be true.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:40:08
If you want to buy and sell BTC efficiently, you are going to have to give your personal information. This isn't a game. They need to keep it secure and safe.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:42:48
I'm registered on GDAX with only 1 ID... weird. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:52:49
You are clearly resilient to accept cryptocurrencies as a trustworthy operation. Why the interest then?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:56:15
Can someone please let me know how cryptocurrencies are anything like a bubble made out of gum or whatever.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:05:55
not unusual. After all time highs there are always declines for up to a few days sometimes.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:46:41
Im in. Someone just needs to earn the trust to be the leader and make it all happen in order for others to give money.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:40:38
Can you manage to find your bitcoin address?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:38:30
Depends on the amount that you are transferring as the coinbase fee is a percentage. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:42:03
*hodler not holder
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:09
dips happen all the time... everyone has seen how quickly bitcoin rises in price in short time periods. Nothing stopping it from hitting 10k by end of year. Especially not a puny dip like this one.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:47:54
What good will that do when you get caught hacking millions of dollars worth of crypto? Might as well just give them a fake name.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:42:06
HODL. I am 17 and have learned... HODLING is best.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:41:41
You are clearly new to cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:07:03
Hahahahah thats a bold statement.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:41:40
dont understand why you are on this sub
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:23:20
Of course we expected it. To the moon!

Are you insane?

I placed a buy order at $3. Watch out everyone, dip to $3 incoming.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:52:15
HODL until the moon.

$500,000 at $0.53. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:57:55
I don't understand why you are so convinced that these exchanges are stealing our identities. LMFAO
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:34:37
Obviously not. lol. I'm talking about the price of bitcoin. Up then down... then up more, then down. etc. Those who think it will do something other than that are truly misinformed. Outside factors that affect the price a couple hundred dollars or so don't mean anything in the long run.
