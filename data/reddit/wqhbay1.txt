Maybe, if we are REALLY LUCKY, the price will fall to $5 again!  /s

HE will reappear and tell Gavin he is fired!

Quite possible, depending on how badly this blocksize fork goes. I won't be buying until it's resolved.
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:23:26
I read it as:
I trust authority
I don't understand the technicalities
I think using words like "fart" increases my credibility
I'm just  a regular dude
I have a short attention span
I'm unable to continue following this debate much longer
I'm getting emotional
I looove Gavin

I find it incredible that anyone could listen to that podcast and not come to the opposite conclusion!

Remember the thousands of gushing posts a year ago about the new new thing, Sidechains?  The hysterical praise of a non-existent entity?  Ha Ha.
Adam Back, BITCOIN GOD, will save us all.  Right.

IOW doom and fate are not approaching, there is no urgency to increase the blocksize, Andreas is a blocksize conservative like Peter Todd. And he seems to have changed his position since sitting in on the latest LTBC podcast on the subject.
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:51:18
You are making too much sense, sir!  
But why not let bitcoin remain bitcoin, and Gavin can then fork his own versions of Gitcoin 0.1, 0.2, etc and see if anyone wants to buy them?
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:54:36
Did you listen to the podcast?  Peter went into detail with the numbers, and addressed all these objections.  As a debate between the two participants, there is no doubt who won, as Gavin just didn't provide any answers to Peter's points.

So true.  has the mentality of consumers.  When do they want the newest shiny improvements? Now.  Because some adults somewhere will make it happen if they shout loud enough.  Do they understand how many large open source projects have destroyed themselves like this?   I'm not characterizing Gavin like this - I just think he's wrong, but look at something like Guido van Rossum's decision to break backward compatibility in Python3.  Years and years of hassle, still not resolved.  Bitcoin might well NOT SURVIVE something like that.
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:59:12
I was on the fence before listening to this.
I sympathise with Gavin's efforts to anticipate the problems he sees approaching in mid-2016, but in the end Peter's arguments were much better.
1) 20m will increase centralization
2) 20m will increase vulnerability to government regulation
3) Taking no action will stimulate new technology to SOLVE the problems, rather than "kicking the can down the road".
4) The risks of a hard fork are not worth the temporary benefit of increasing to 20m
5) The likelihood of achieving consensus on 20m are small
6) The risks to the community by forcing the issue are significant

Luke-jr is a genius in his malign influence on bitcoin.  He has outdone himself this time by actually being on the right side of the argument, and therefore giving ammunition to those who are on the wrong side.  
Pure satanic evil!

In 2013 Bitcoin was not 49.1% of the crypto market.  There are three possible roles for Bitcoin:
1) Money
2) Reserve currency/digital gold
3) Gateway to cryptotrading
A large part of this bubble has been due to newbies being shown coinmarketcap.com and realizing what a huge casino it is.
By 2020 I think it's going to be settled as the third possibility.
@_date: 2015-11-21 15:40:54
That price is an insult.  What is the profit margin?  
Of course, they know that there will always be the "why don't you do something better" crowd urging people to throw their money away by insulting them with the old "basement dweller" shaming trick.  
All you are doing is mindless cheerleading.
And yes, sometimes business models are total crap.

My guess is that we are not going to be free of this POS Wright any time soon.  He has more cards to play in his long con, and exactly how he plans to benefit is not clear.  I'm sure it's not for the sake of his long-suffering employees though, if you read what his previous business associates have to say about him.
For the time being I think we all have to resign ourselves to the fact that he has attached himself to bitcoin like a [remora]( and there is not going to be any easy way to remove him, especially given his success with Gavin and Matonis.

Everyone should read pbx1's list, and think about it very carefully.
It is *not* beyond reasonable doubt that Gavin may have been a bad actor for a very long time.  Let's think more like security people, and less like cheerleaders.  Satoshi cut off contact with Gavin when he went to *meet the CIA*.  The CIA subvert and control people *all the time*.  It's what they do.  Anyone who is willing to accept Gavin might have been conned by Wright should think about how poor naive little Gavin might have stood up against the real professionals.

Somewhere Karpeles is laughing at you, you idealistic chump.

Glad you pointed this out.  The Foundation was a cancer on bitcoin from its inception.  Gavin has been a disaster as the most public face of bitcoin.  Frankly, I don't care if people are "allowed" to question his integrity or not.  He should be shunned by the bitcoin community as much as Hearn.  Here's some of his track record, compiled by pb1x :
Gavin co-founds the Bitcoin Foundation with Karpeles
    I was bamboozled!
He doesn't ask questions when the MMMGlobal Ponzi scheme is added as a Bitcoin Foundation Member
    I was bamboozled!
He publicly vouches for Peter Vessenes as Chairman of the Foundation, who is accused of taking 20 grand, and has various other court cases pending, accused of taking 5 million from MTGox
    I was bamboozled!
He includes Charlie Shrem as a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation, who was later found to be coordinating with a darknet drug money launderer, with full knowledge
    I was bamboozled!
He attaches himself to the Bitcoin Unlimited project, and promotes Peter R's work, who is accused of being a plagiarist on various occasions
    I was bamboozled!
He promotes the MyBitcoin service as where users of Bitcoin of the future will store their Bitcoins safely, the service later disappears with people's Bitcoins
    I was bamboozled!
He promotes the work of Mike Hearn, who later turns on Bitcoin and calls it "failed" and then does a press tour and blog posts slamming Bitcoin
    I was bamboozled!
So who does Gavin demand extraordinary proof of, demand that they leave Bitcoin, say they are destroying Bitcoin? Why the Core Devs (who have actually saved Bitcoin from numerous real problems). And the Lightning Network guys. An interesting discrepancy.
And Gavin's operating thesis at the moment is that the "no trust" / "trust only in math" foundation of Bitcoin should be abandoned, and that we should not consider a situation in which a miner abuses this trust.
    Any theoretical attack that begins with '51% of miners....' is just not interesting. 51% of miners deciding to be evil is outside the Bitcoin threat model.
    If you don't trust miners to want bitcoin to succeed then you should move to a proof of stake coin
And the actual Satoshi on matters of trust?
    everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust

Excellent summary of Gavin's amazingly, astonishingly poor track record.  I have also slowly come to the position that he is not merely naive, but has been a subtly bad actor from the very beginning.
When I reflect on the fact that the real Satoshi cut off contact with Gavin after he arranged a meeting with the CIA, a chill goes up my spine, and I wonder whether the real Satoshi is still alive.

You should read the original book behind the movie 'Catch Me If You Can', by Frank Abagnale.  It's a lot funnier than the movie, and more inspiring too!  (PBay is yr friend):)

You are not alone.  The "Je suis Charlie" shit makes me want to puke too.  It's a symptom of herd mentality.  Nauseating and contemptible.
