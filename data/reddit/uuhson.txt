Isn't this relative stability over the last 6 months a better scenario for Bitcoin since it should encourage actually using Bitcoin as as a currency?

Nonce also known as an input vector is not a hash result, it's a number added before the hash to preturb the result

Same, I just took another mortgage on my home to buy at $8200
@_date: 2019-11-20 06:51:21
Are you seriously asking the Bitcoin fan club if it's a scam or not?
@_date: 2016-06-20 09:13:34
One gets wasted and the others a waste

Why don't you just dump your savings in it now and put your paycheck back into your savings to replace it
@_date: 2016-06-20 08:17:10
Sell them for whatever you can as soon as the hard fork happens

I'm not denying some people will still be using it as a lotto ticket, I'm just saying the general public will mostly have soured on it at this point

A guarantee from the most powerful organization in the history of humanity?
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:50:45
If you have a lot of Bitcoin and you're trying to dump it all, it makes the most sense to spread as much false hope as possible to make people still want to buy. I suspect that's what at least some of the hodler talk is about
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:05:53
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:42:08
Yeah you could have sold for 400 in 2019 instead
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:27:01
After how badly things crashed when Bitcoin was in the public spotlight, I don't know what makes anyone think people will get back into it as a lotto ticket again

They don't even own a computer yet you think they're capable of contributing to an open source software project?
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:52:29
You don't think it's a problem that this keeps happening? How is this going to be a useful currency if it loses value this often

Albert Einstein

I hear working is a good way to get your hands on some fiat
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:24:34
Every dollar you aren't spending on Bitcoin might as well be flushed down the toilet. It literally *has* to moon someday
Edit: apparently this wasn't sarcastic enough
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:06:27
Don't you hodlers want low volume? Why would there be volume if everyone's hodling
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:36:34
If anything this picture just shows how stupid these people are

How are you going to order solar panels if there's no internet or power?

If OP has 500$ to spend on internet dollars they can afford a 7$ fee
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:12:12
I was being incredibly sarcastic

His name? Albert Einstein.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:07:30
It's actually going to get worse since the supply of Bitcoin is going to increase even slower as time goes on
@_date: 2019-01-26 02:15:14
Isn't it conjecture that demand will be the same by then?
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:25:19
This is why I come to this sub
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:05:04
Where do you get these specific numbers from?
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:03:14
Because I can go to a store and instantly buy anything I want? That's why it's better

If you're living paycheck to paycheck you probably shouldn't be spending money in bitcoin

They can barely use a keyboard, I don't think they'll be able to figure this out
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:37:28
You should buy so someone else can make real money by selling
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:45:35
If you love the tech why are you hoarding them instead of using them for transactions?
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:31:41
The fundamentals behind block chain are like 60 years old. The actual discrete math involved isn't even remotely new
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:36:28




If less bitcoins are going to be produced, their value will be increased faster, meaning there's less incentive to spend them.
If you own something that you know will rapidly increase value, it incentivises hoarding(hodling). If Bitcoin is something to be hoarded and not spent, how will that help adoption? There's no economy if there's no spending.
I'm not even talking at all about transfer fees or speed
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:32:46
I've literally never heard of that and I live in the tech capital of the world. What types of business are these?

The inventor is still alive and kicking, some guy bought the company and then died
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:06:16
you're asking other people to tell you where they live but you wont even tell us what your country is
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:15:04
Except fraud is reversible with them
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:30:48
Sure thing dick
@_date: 2018-12-16 10:30:55
So this currency will have even less incentive to be spent, which is going to help adoption how?
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:49:51
Sounds like you're spreading FUD, but that's ok since it's for your team
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:37:32
Only those with the strongest hands will continue hodling when the financial crisis hits, and when they die of starvation or lack of shelter they will be the ultimate hodler
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:13:42
That's honestly part of the reason Bitcoin will never be a universal currency, there's too much incentive to horde it which isn't good for a healthy economy
@_date: 2018-12-03 11:22:42
What is there to talk about? And why aren't you starting discussion about it?
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:46:09
The other coins are more like other branches of Christianity, Bitcoin is Catholicism and altcoins are protestantism
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:04:53
literally everything is a sign of a bull run
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:46:53
Damn that sucks
