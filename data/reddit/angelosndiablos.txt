[There was actually an announcement today about a Cryptomine that’s runs off grid, and the power output is controlled via tire feed stock. (aka reusing old tires)](

His fund is called [Full Tilt](
I actually can't find anything regarding the $25 million number, but pretty sure I've heard it on podcasts, if not, I know him personally. But I know that doesn't help you or the sub.

Full Tilt usually invests pre-Series A (but has invested at other times), so very very early in a companies inception. Obviously, at that stage they are investing more in people than the company per se.
Pomp himself has started a few smaller tech companies, but then ending up working on growth teams during Facebook's rise. He then did some small scale consulting and then managed to use his connections to create this fund. The first fund was geared more towards tech (apps/mobile) companies, where he could use his skills learned at Facebook to inject large growth and immediately see 10x on his investments. 
Now he is focusing on crypto/blockchain as he sees this is where the future will head in 10+ years. 
He actually also has a [Mining Company]( that is using a tech he invested in in his first fund. It recycles tires and uses the energy generated from it to mitigate the energy costs that are associated with mining. 
He's a very good speaker that sees the big picture. Then identifies who is necessary to surround himself with to achieve those goals. 
I'd definitely follow him on twitter. He's rah rah but he also has gold nuggets of info, especially on the podcasts he's featured in.

Pomp runs a $25 million dollar crypto/block chain investment fund. He uses his twitter as a tool to hype up his investments and hype Cryto (mostly Bitcoin). With that he has garnered some non-believers so he ends a lot of his Bitcoin tweets with “the virus is spreading.”
