Nice to see it growing in Argentina!. Bitcoin technology is empowering and welcoming to the game to billions of unbanked people. And the blockchain peer-to-peer open source decentralized secure technology will be used for many more applications, like escrow, contracts, voting, global ledger, etc.

We don't need to beg anybody to give us our freedom/rights back. We are free, just have to realize it and act on it. The tools are in our hands:
There is a viable alternative right now. Decentralized peer-to-peer worldwide distributed open source cryptographically secured math based-trustless blockchain technology is the way to empower the people and bypass banks and all centralized financial institutions, the path to reset the control from the few to the many, is the future for everything. The potential implications of the development of distributed consensus technologies is revolutionary. It is very safe, since is cryptographically secured by a distributed global mathematical algorithm and public decentralized open source ledger, a revolutionary disruptive technology called 'Blockchain'. 
This could be the future of money for everything, from donations, micropayments, money transfers, online shopping and bill payments, etc. 
Empowering and welcoming to the game to billions of unbanked people. And the blockchain peer-to-peer open source decentralized secure technology will be used for many more applications, like escrow, contracts, voting, global ledger, etc.
Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized distributed computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). Dollars are not backed by gold anymore since long time ago, they are printed by the trillions out of nothing by the private institution called "Federal" Reserve.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Almost for free (a few cents fee).
 
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically)
 
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
 
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
 
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
 
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
 
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
We shouldn't be like the ones that were dismissing the internet not long ago as a "den of pedophiles, drug dealers and terrorists". The blockchain is the biggest thing since the internet and will benefit also the billions of under and unbanked people.
