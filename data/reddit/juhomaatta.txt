Finland probably takes the first place in countries that tax cryptocurrencies the most. Every single time you make a profitable trade you owe 30-34% of profits in taxes. How about you make a bad trade? Taxman doesn't care and as far he is concerned the trade never happened; you can't deduct the loss from profits. This makes it possible to owe more in taxes than you ever had money.
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:31:53
Just divide. 0,01 satoshis.
@_date: 2018-08-17 19:01:25
But you get to deduct losses from profits? We don't. If I make a 100€ profit today and lose 100€ tomorrow the taxman still wants 30€ from me. Turn your 100€ to 200€ and back to 100€ four times and you have the 100€ and 120€ of tax debt.

Still more difficult than using BitPay and even more difficult if you didn't want to take 100% of bitcoin payments in bitcoin but something like 50% in bitcoin and 50% in fiat. You cannot assume that Microsoft doesn't accept bitcoin as bitcoin. Even if Microsoft keeps just 1% in bitcoin and converts the rest to USD it's still better than nothing, right?

"At this point, one Bitcoin is worth more than $355 (€286), so in case you use this currency to add funds to your account, there’s no doubt that you’ll have a lot of apps to purchase with this amount of money."

Why does everybody assume Microsoft, or any other company, takes all bitcoin payments in fiat? Even though they use BitPay they can still keep 100% of bitcoin payments in bitcoin.

How do you plan on handling the delivery? How many Chromebooks are you planning on buying? How much do they cost? How long does it take for you to pay back one Chromebook if it is rented every day, if it is rented every other day? Do you think anybody would rent that old hardware after it has payed itself back? What if Chromebook breaks?

Sick of reading all these DCA promotions. Sure, if you had DCA in bitcoin for years, you would have made profit, but so would have every other investment strategy; most of them way more than DCA.
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:37:15
Only time DCA wins a lump sum is when prices go down. Who would have guessed that investing only part of your money in something that is going down is better than investing all. And even then lump sum outperforms DCA quickly when prices start to go up again.
@_date: 2019-11-02 14:24:17
Half the article is explaining why DCA is not great even though there are bear markets. Either you did not read the article or did not understand it.
@_date: 2019-11-02 10:40:57
Any strategy on something that has gone up like a million % would have been profitable. Calculate what you would have made of you invested all at once any day over 8 years ago and you would have made more than by using dca.

How is making several purchases less time and energy consuming than making one?
@_date: 2019-11-03 07:13:17
Sure, but I would not consider having no money as a strategy. It is the best (only) option on unfortunate circumstances. People should also read the part 'Continuous investing is not DCA'.
@_date: 2019-11-02 23:22:17
Why do you think the lump sum has to be huge? Profits should be calculated in percentages, which are the same for small and big investments. Article does not imply there are no bubbles, irresponcible banks, governments or any other things you stated. They just don't matter and that is all explained in the article. You are assuming it is better to wait for bubbles to pop when clearly you would have been better off investing before many times, one reason for that is bubbles don't erase all The profits of the previous rise. And I don't even know what this has to do with DCA. So the point you are making is that DCA is good because it might be somebodys only option?
@_date: 2019-11-03 07:08:21
You did not read the article? 
"DCA will only protect you from the risk of the stock going down during the period of DCA. Nothing prevents the market from plunging the day after you have finished your DCA investment."
You could even pick almost every ATH in Bitcoin history and still be better of investing lump sum than still be investing DCA. Also now you would have risked the same amount of your money. And these are the worst case scenarios for lump sum investing! As the article stated, markets are going up most of the time so you are more likely to not buy when prices are declining.
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:48:56
Investing in lump sum 9 years ago would have made you over 200 millions. By DCA you are not only cutting your risks but also your profits.
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:15:21
You don't need to time things perfectly to beat DCA. Often you can even buy at the ATH and still beat DCA. You should really read some of the links posted above.
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:55:37

First rule of investing is to start early. Every dollar has the same potential so why not take advantage of them all and diversify in other ways. Having no money to invest is not a an investment strategy.
@_date: 2019-10-20 18:34:24
Sure, but that makes no difference. Same point applies if you don't have 'more' money to invest; that is not an investment strategy.

I'm sure.

Edit: And yes, this makes little sense since a daytrader can quickly make more taxdebt than he/she has money.
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:33:15
I live in Finland and have invested in this because of taxing. We are supposed to pay taxes for every single winning cryptotrade while every losing trade is ignored. So If you make 100 euros monday and lose 100 euros tuesday, you still have to pay 30 euros taxes for winning monday. At least with this I can deduct losses from winnings so I don't end up with more taxdebt than I have money.
