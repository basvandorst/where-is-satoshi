If everyone in MMM Global is using Bitcoin, then it's laughable at what their effect has had on the price and the exchanges. Even if they were all to pull out at once, I think we'll see a healthy pull-back which we've been seeing up until now.

I've read Mavrodi's excerpts from the book. It's all grand and happy thinking you're spreading wealth or posing as a shared bank, but it's still a ponzi scheme at the end.
It's centrally controlled and relies on a form of predication to achieve success. He's targeting the poor around the world for a grander vision of financial success. Historically, failure rate for such schemes is 100%, so this is no different.
Don't get caught up in this man.

You are correct, and once they spend them, it goes to the free market and exchanges and gets divvied up around the world.
The problem with wealth nowadays is capital control. No one controls Bitcoin, so wealth is free to move wherever the fuck it wants to. Anyone, anywhere, can use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:05:12
Bitcoin cannot and will not be controlled by banks because self-regulation is written in the protocol. It's self governing as to how many Bitcoins can be mined and at what rate, so your argument of Bankers somehow controlling Bitcoin is flawed.
They can control exchanges, yes, but what's stopping someone else in a different country starting their own? If bankers think they can corner the market, they're wrong. Eventually all Bitcoins in use will find their way onto an exchange once they've been used, so coins will be circulated around (Unlike the 1% who just sit on hoards of printed money no one knows about).
Banker's cannot control the supply of Bitcoin, ever.

The Rial has faced economic sanctions and has drastically inflated in recent years. Dollars are common but they're troublesome to get in and out of the country, and are informally banned by Bank Markazi (Central Bank) of Iran.
If they can make the move to Bitcoin to get around sanctions, it'll be most welcome. Iran is also a country full of young and educated engineers that'll understand the concept rather quickly, like China did. The young, affluent and educated will flock to Bitcoin if it provides relief from their own fiat currency from going down the drain.
It's a perfect storm for Bitcoin to take precedence in Iran. Lets just hope they don't fuck up their chance completely.

@_date: 2014-05-27 18:44:19
John Forbes Nash Jr. the genius in "A Beautiful Mind" released a paper years ago with a proposal for "Ideal Money", a fundamentally sound monetary platform... but something was missing.
Years later, in 2009, someone named Satoshi Nakamoto releases a white paper outlining a revolutionary new monetary protocol and fits John Nash's description of ideal money.
I'm trying to connect-the-dots and it all seems to make sense now. Bitcoin is the product of a Nobel prize winning genius. The times are tumultuous now, but it's becoming ever growing and ever expansive in the last year.
If Bitcoin isn't a new paradigm in money, I don't know what is. The efforts of thinkers and revolutionaries before would have gone to waste. The protocol that is Bitcoin is going to breathe life into the internet in ways we've never thought before.
John Nash is Satoshi.
Boom goes the dynamite.

@_date: 2014-03-02 04:40:43
I don't think so.
I've spent the better part of a week combing through Mochizuki's papers and they are written in almost the exact same fashion as the Satoshi white paper. Also, he's elusive and just the kind of 'dance away genius' that Satoshi is.
He pulled from various works to make Bitcoin, but the real original part is the mathematical algorithm that led to the block chain, which only a genius like him could have devised.
@_date: 2014-03-02 06:02:17


Mochizuki ticks all the boxes when compared to Satoshi's behavior and mannerisms online.
The way he wrote the paper, his level of english, his deep understanding of elliptical curves and the anonymity are just too prominent to ignore.
He's a man lost in his own thought, and there will be more of him in the future.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:22:02
No one knows if he even has a hot wallet. He's never spent any of the coins he mined in the early days.

You fork the chain and re-instate a new hashing algorithm.
It's going to piss off all of the miners for sure, so they may or may not want to mine the new chain. But once we go to say SHA-3, everyone can go back to PC mining and build our way up to ASIC hardware.
@_date: 2014-03-02 06:10:19
Nick doesn't have the mathematical capability that Satoshi has. I think it's only coincidence that people are linking him with Bitcoin. His work was definitely seen and taken into account by Satoshi though, that's my theory.
I've already sent numerous emails to Mochizuki and I have not even received one reply, even when I was being an imposter as a potential guest student of his, and boy did I spend some time writing it. You would figure the guy would email me back to curse me for spamming his inbox, but, nothing.
IIRC Nick has already denied that he is Satoshi. Mochizuki still remains elusive. He won't confirm or deny.

Bitcoin's core protocol is out of the bag and the blockchain is going to change humanity forever.
Regardless if the CIA controls Bitcoin, they know they can't stop the floodgate of decentralized apps from getting out.
They've shot themselves in their foot more than they'd like to by releasing the core protocol... it's going to turn around and bite them in the ass.
I don't think the original Satoshi was CIA or the project was created by the CIA. I think perhaps once Gavin went to the CIA, is when the original Satoshi abandoned contact and ditched the project altogether. There is validity in a centralized group controlling the development structure for sure. Who? Maybe we'll never know.

He pulled from various works of course, he mentioned it in his white paper.
The invention of the block chain was all his though, and that's the genius he will be remembered for.
Read Mochizuki's papers and it'll hit you right smack dab between your eyes. It's him, I'm sure of it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:12:32
Well here's the flip argument, can bankers buy all of the altcoins too? I have a feeling exchanges on Wall St. won't be tied just to Bitcoin, so price manipulation can only happen to a certain degree with a few coins, but never all of them.
The emergence of a proper free market will come when alt coins hit critical mass and start to spill over. It'll be a frenzy. This is a banker's worst nightmare.
@_date: 2014-05-31 01:55:48
"Ideal Money" is the first one. It's even in the same bloody font as the Bitcoin white paper.
If you go through Nick Szabo's blog "Unenumerated" you can draw many parallels to John Nash's work. John's prior work is scattered throughout the internet, but quickly accessible via a google search.
John is in his 80's, but many people have reported that his mind has been the most stable since before his schizophrenia in 1959 (Prior to 1959, his work in Game Theory sealed the deal on his genius).
Also, John is THE pioneer in elliptical curve mathematics, which Bitcoin uses extensively.

Think of it this way, the Bitcoin network is the only "independent" financial network that exists today. It's not run or controlled by any entity, and almost completely self sufficient to a degree.
If the old legacy banking system fails, Bitcoin will be our only option. It's global and pretty much complete, end to end.
A global catastrophe or a banking crisis will actually turn more eyes to Bitcoin, so no, I don't think it would kill it, but strengthen it.

Look at the network effect of the Internet. Bitcoin knows no bounds, just like the network propagation that continues to turn more and more users to the Internet each day. Its success is determined by the success of the Internet itself, as I'm more than certain that as long as the Internet exists, so will a form of Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency)
Binary outcomes are usually inherent of technology. It's either it goes the full way, or it doesn't. In this case, Bitcoin is too revolutionary of a protocol to simply be left in 'middle ground'. It'll either become an internet standard in which everyone uses, or it'll become superseded by something better. 
In no way will it simply 'drop to zero' unless something catastrophic happens and the open source community cannot race to fix it.

There is zero "government" backing dollars, euro's, what have you, by private central bankers.

@_date: 2014-03-11 07:34:03
Your questions are exactly the ones I've made myself.
I don't know how comfortable the government would actually be with Bitcoin, but if they do decide to dip their hand in it, they will definitely price oil and other exportables in Bitcoin and use it as a way of getting around international banking.
If this plan is actually applied, Iran would probably lead as a shining example of how US imperialism and control over monetary networks has completely failed.
Also, they'd probably triple the price of Bitcoin overnight. :)
Realistically speaking, I could see Iranian companies if given a green light by the government, swiftly taking and accepting Bitcoin for goods. It really is pretty bad there when already the price of chicken and essentials fluctuates 10% a week.

Bigger liquidity pool.
When a sumo wrestler splashes into a kiddie pool, he's going to make a giant splash. If he jumps into an Olympic sized swimming pool, people will barely notice.
The bigger the market cap of Bitcoin, the more stable the large purchases and sell offs have of affecting the entire system.
There has never been a start up currency in the history of mankind to be valued from zero to X during it's lifetime. Usually it's valued at a certain market cap the first day it goes into circulation. Not Bitcoin.

You set up a web page, offering X amount of Bitcoin per person. Easily done without revealing Satoshi's identity.
People will flock like crazy to get free money. It'll be all over the news.

You clearly don't understand that with Bitcoin's fluctuating value, that they can't possibly, remotely consider a Bitcoin only option.
Until fiat money is more volatile than Bitcoin, fiat will always be accepted.

Dude knows what he was prepared for before buying into the stash of coins.
Long term I bet he'd be quite pleased with his investment...

Wait until the time is right, and do an airdrop to everyone on the internet, probably during the next financial crisis that's about to hit us this year or next.

What a shame.
However, someone else with better bookkeeping abilities will hopefully take over and steer this ship around.

What is this, an advertisement for Vaultoro? Bitgold has been doing BTC to Gold before everyone else.
"looks at username" ahh.....

Wait, but a founding father of Bitcoin told us that this was a failed experiment. IT HAS TO BE TRUE RIGHT?

I'm pretty sure the only reason why this buffoon has any voice is because he's being bankrolled by some capricious banker.
If not, then he's completely oblivious to the technological merits of Bitcoin and everything else that makes Bitcoin unique and prescient. Total dumbass.

Off to the slammer you piece of shit.

Gold didn't fall of the cliff, the USD is stronger against Gold.
BS jobs numbers came out so the market is reacting.

Love seeing this every time. :)
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:49:20
Good luck with that.

You can't get fiat in and out so the arbitrage opportunity is almost non-existent.
@_date: 2015-11-06 14:14:04
Complete bullshit, as if the economy is still trucking along.

How pimp would a decentralized pimp be.
Really pimp.
