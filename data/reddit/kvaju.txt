Can somebody please explain, if btc implement lightning, transactions will be much faster, but what about fee, will they still be this high?

Well tomorrow will be 2 weeks since my btc is traveling from Bread wallet to Bitstamp, i choose low fee.
I really wish I did not choose that way of sending btc, now I have no idea when will they arrive

Other than reddit I’m affraid to trust any other site, but kinda unnsure about a lot of stuff, and kinda think this is not a place for stupid questions, and i think this app will be so much better in the future if other users join and contibute even more. So upvote let others see it.

Also new at all this, but bitcoin cash sounds ok from what I saw on yt, thats my noob thinking.
On bitcoincash.com it saids it decentralized and no group or company owns it, are they laying?
Becouse I think I want to invest some money and buy some, and if this is fake, will buy some more btc.

well, I hope it goes down at least 5k, so I buy even more, than march to ATH with me :D

Well i wrote it in the comment becouse when you press the title it will lead you to an app (for the lazy).
Well this app is like some sort of social network for crypto, where you can choose witch coins to follow, and news about them, and reviews about them.
Also that goes for exchanges, wallets etc.
Users of app writes reviews etc.
If a review is good you can send that users some coins
For me it is great becouse i can actually see whitch exchanges accept my country finally.

Wish I had see a app like this before, it is great for begginers, and it will be even better in the future the more people start using it.

Thank you for responding. But if they are selling it to rich gamblers, I kinda doubt the price will skyrock, maybe they will short it, and make $ instead? I mean adoption is great, but I really don't see why is this so big deal? After CME launch the price keep tanking.

Thank you for your  time to reply, but can somebody ELI5?
All I see is much rich people if they want to gamble with btc price, they will have to have btc, not li CME. Is that all?
