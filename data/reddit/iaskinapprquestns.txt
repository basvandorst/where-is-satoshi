Thank you, you meant with $1000 I'd rather buy 1/10 bitcoin than a rig to mine it for years?

Thank you, may I ask who will fix it? What if bugs are found by hackers and they take advantage of it to steal bitcoins? Thus destroy everything?

So when someone pays us, we have to pay tax for that payment in bitcoin at that time. 
We keep it for a year and sell it at a higher price, we have to pay capital gain tax. Is that what you mean?
