None of these articles show any evidence. They all copy and past the same statements from each other.

You must be psychic! How do you now what the Swiss Financial Regulator is doing if none of this is public? Can you predict the future?

Did you create it? How can you send a conviction that does not exist?

Kadhim, great article. How much did they pay you to publish this?

I read the article, it is a misinterpretation. Gastauer was never sentenced to 18 months prison. There is a not a single mention of his name on the original text. This could have been any of the 5 directors this company had who got convicted. **Gastauer`s attorneys have denied this allegation.**

He sold the assets of Apax for 480m USD to CIMB. Apax was a Group of companies. There are official documents published showing all kinds of activity of this Group around the world. When you say "went into liquidation shortly after he set them up" do you mean 10 years later? Apax Group sold its Assets and than dissolved the legal entities.

What a joke, do you understand German? This article is not stating any names. This could be any of the 5 directors the company had. If you call the district court of Zurich they will not release any names either, because court documents are published without names in Switzerland. Looks like you a trying to make up a story. Are you one of the these guys around Christian Koenig who started the hate campaign against Gastauer?
