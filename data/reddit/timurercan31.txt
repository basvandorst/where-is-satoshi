Using electrum is a solid choice. If you plan on storing larger amounts longterm consider investing in a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger. They also allow easy and secure moving of coins.

While technically true, it implies instability and "unproveness". Both attributes, which make the general public think it is generally unwise to consider bitcoin.

T is neat but you really just need a one for longterm storage. Also Consider using something more durable for your backup key like crypto steel.

Use a Hardware Wallet like Trezor or Ledger. They are very user friendly and highly secure if you follow best practices, which are explained extensively on their website.
\- Not your keys, not your coins: Don't keep coins on the exchange you bought
\- Don't build your own hardware wallet, the chances you will make a fatal mistake are pretty hight
\- Store your backup key securely (use something like cryptosteel or DIY variants)

Trezor for example is open source and can be reviewed by anyone. A basic bug of this proportion is highly improblable. On other wallets like Ledger you have to Trust the manufacturer.

Trezor and Ledger (others also) wallets generate the private locally after you initialize them. If the device is geniuine this is safe. Be sure to check the stickers on the box before proceding to use. If you cant or wont store your backup seed in a safe location look into shamir backup (e.g. 5 seed, you need 3 to restore. If one is stolen there is no problem)

DYOR on Trezor :) In any case it it MUCH less based on trust than any other system. How do you know your online banking interface has no bugs or critical vulnerabilities?

The Hardware Wallet UI pulls the balances more or less directly from the Blockain. It does so however using the public adresses. When the private key is required for sending funds or similar actions, the transaction is signed on the devices and send out afterwards. The private keys never leave the hardware wallet and therefore do not touch the internet, which is why hardware wallets are safe.

Buy directly from the manufacturers website, never Amzon or similar and be sure to check the seals on the box.

Don't leave your coins on exchanges. Not your keys, not your coins.

This. Also it can hardly be overused until it's mainstream common knowledge.

If you are based in Europe: Bitwala is a neat Bitcoin-focused bank with small buying fees. Free debitcard and account included.
