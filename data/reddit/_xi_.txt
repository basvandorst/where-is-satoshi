First off, I didn't actually follow the link, I'm not an idiot. Just trying to scam a scammer. It's pretty obviously a scam if for no other reason than it comes from HK. 
Im a way this is how you know BTC has finally made it, when people start trying to scam one another for it.

The next time a suicide crash happens we should post the ol bitcoin switcharoo and link it to the previous suicide crash post.

This is good for BurnCoin.

As opposed to your government, which will let you have legalized weed in one state and then shot to kill you for it in another.

I'm personally waiting for the next angst filled suicide rush so I can buy in again. Like. Fucking. Clockwork. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:57:42
This. Yeap. Sad thing is the dude has listed NOTHING about himself other than he's into finance and world of warcraft. Like, give me SOMETHING to work on here, dude. 
Oh well.

They thought I was crazy when I was buying it all up at 15, 60 and 150. 
Well, now they can suck it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:47:04
Yeah, where was this ban during the jump to $1000 where ALMOST EVERY POST was 'derp derp next stop mars guise'

There are a lot of people on localbitcoin who will meet in person to buy coins or do bank deposits. I miss the days of bitinstant. I'd gladly go back to the 3% charge if it meant just walking down to my corner store and doing a moneygram.

Yeap. We have a fairly large subscriber base and absolutely zero competition. As someone behind the scenes in IT, it infuriates me how much money we make but spend next to nothing on infrastructure.
EDIT: I should be a little more clear. We DO make some cash off of ads, but it's still nothing near the amount of the money people pay directly to get streams of movies they watch once. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:17:42
And yet the porn company I work for won't. *Sigh*. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:37:32
What's even worse is THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THE SUICIDE HOTLINE WAS POSTED HERE. This happens EVERY CRASH. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:45:57
All we need is for the UK to drop the euro and adopt BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:14:53
The link is plastered all over @_date: 2013-11-27 09:29:17
The reverse could also happen. "Oh wow, you mean my american dollar could buy 10,000 of your 'bitcoins'? Ha, no thanks, keep your monopoly money!"

Live by the china boom, die by the china crash. Anyone who didn't see this coming deserves the loss. Did you really think China; the world's largest economic power, was going to invest in a currency it couldn't control? Faith blinds people from rationality.

Also, more words rhyme with Milli, so it's more likely for a rapper to pick up and use in a bitcoin centric rap song. Which we all know is the only way this ponzi scheme will take off.

Couldn't you also just set your client to 0.0010 TX fee instead of the 0.0005 for instant conformations?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:43:59
Seriously, bitcoiners threaten suicide more than your average teenager. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:47:17
As someone inside the industry, a lot of people surprisingly. I don't get it either and I work here. 
Though, I suppose SOMEONE has to pay for it otherwise the flow of new porn would stop because it's no longer profitable.  
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:46:05
I lost roughly 35BTC to Satoshi Dice. Am I upset? Naw. Why? I've made roughly 36.2BTC on casual SD gambling. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:10:29
I would have been the asshole who answered "What is litecoin?" 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:29:26
I was doing the same. Was gonna buy some BTC for my reddit santa gift but fuck it, I'm just gonna buy them a WoW time card I guess. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:14:10
Maybe it's run by the CIA as opposed to the other two new market places which are run by the DEA. Both trying to run the more successful drug ring to validate next year's proposed budget.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:14:33
Mind you, these are all from 8 months ago. 
All of which mention suicide over BTC. The hyperbole here is the only thing reaching the moon.
