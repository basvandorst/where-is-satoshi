For that you can always set a 25th passphrase and engrain that in your head. That way, only you have access to all your keys.
Also, do ensure that you set your passphrase to 50 characters or lower so that it would be compatible with other hardware wallet as of 2019.
If you are afraid that your words were to belost to fire, engrave your words to a metal plate. There are services that allow you you to do so.

You are waiting for your keys to be stolen by putting it online.
You can lose your hardware wallet, but all your need is you 24-word passphrase. So, just store the seed offline in multiple safe locations.
If you want to be part of the revolution where you are in control of your finances, you got to be responsible. If not, just put all your money in the bank and they will be “responsible” for you...

Get a hardware wallet, and sleep peacefully.   
You won't even need to ask such question anymore because you feel peaceful. LOL

It is safe till the private keys are stolen. It is quite all right for daily use, but if you are thinking of storing it for long term, go for a hardware wallet, or a paper wallet. 
The ultimate goal is to make sure that your seed/private keys are never stored online.

No worries! The CEO of bitcoin got your back!
Try calling customer support :)

It's sad that the no-coiners pity us for getting into crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:13:12
The CEO of bitcoin said 2.5k :)

Just wondering, what happens when the central banks print money? What do they do with the printed money? Do they buy assets or bonds?
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:28:25
Obviously :)

Did you use the native seg wit? What wallet did you use?
@_date: 2019-08-19 01:23:24
Thanks for the answer! It is really informative.
@_date: 2019-10-20 12:46:18
Omg that is brilliant! I can also even increase the block size and make her process more shit!

If the thief uses the bitcoin, the btc will be back in the circulating supply. ;)

Well said.

My mama told me to save everything in cash, because cash is king.

Really good read, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2019-10-20 12:28:20
I told my mama that, but my mama is too fat to understand. She didn’t feed me after that... that’s why I went rouge and got into Bitcoin CASH!

Isn't this just a pile of centralized trash with little to no innovation? What do you think?
@_date: 2019-08-08 03:19:45
Upgrade your bank with an added 25th passphrase :)

Singapore has capital gain tax if it is used for trading.

It is not easy for fresh graduates to accumulate IMHO. I started working last year, and I am have been going all-in crypto. I sacrificed my entertainment and relationship but I only managed to accumulate around USD 20k  worth of crypto at the current market price, after spending around 1 year 6 months.
I work in Japan, and pension, compulsory social insurance, and taxes are pretty crazy here.
I really believe in crypto, and that is why I am making these not so rational decisions (maybe).
I hope delayed gratification pays off eventually :)

That’s the golden rule. Do you have a target price?
@_date: 2019-04-04 03:09:23
Thank you very much for the advice!

That’s good news. Haha. What is the reason for the drop anyway?
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:00:12
I am waiting for the correction, thinking of going in at 4500.... any thoughts?

The dump seems to be over?

When you make a send transaction, all your BTC will be sent minus the BTC you intend to send. The rest will be your change. IIRC :) 
Hope the BTC is in your wallet after the update :)
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:55:32
Hmm, it would be great if someone can someone enlighten us.
I am your transaction shows that you sent the correct amount.
Relax and go grab something to drink :)
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:40:30
I am pretty that is your change. Did you get your 1.0004254 BTC back?
@_date: 2019-09-21 03:29:08
Woah, this explanation is golden.
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:48:07
I always believe that insiders are doing all these. Especially for crypto where it is so unregulated. Any thoughts about this?
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:20:06
You are right, but the "insiders" could be people who are in the executive position in companies or people who are regulators. They get firsthand information on what's going on before press release.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:22:30
Thanks for the great insights!
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:09:18
I agree, I usually close the tab immediately.
