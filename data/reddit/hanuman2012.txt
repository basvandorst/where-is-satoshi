google translate makes reddit comments seem rational. We now just have to wait for the previous five ministries to fart.

10.a (in part): New Israeli Sheqel will 
legally serve as means of payment for 
all purposes including official transactions. ...
b. Both sides will continue to discuss, 
through the JEC, the possibility of in- 
troducing mutually agreed Palestinian 
currency or temporary alternative cur- 
rency arrangements for the Palestinian 
Authority. 
etc. etc. 
overriding general superseding clause: Palestinian Authority cannot dig a water well or even FART without prior written permission from Israel. :(

Can someone please explain how does a minder determine the block size? Is there a fix that can require minimum block size or # of transactions? I am not a coder but am puzzled by how can a miner get away with less than 1KB block. (the blocks less than 100KB may constitute 5-10% of all blocks)

Please link to other posts. This is the first time I have seen it. All other coinbase threads are about how great they are delivering regardless of the price going up.

CAUTION: COINBASE NO LONGER HONORS PRICE!

Hi, Can you please help me understand - when I add New Software Authentication System (google authenticator), i was able to remove it with a single click (in the security center) without passwords or anything else. So, if account password is compromised then authenticator has no value - correct? (in which case I am at a loss explaining how a withdrawal happens without account password/access)

Curious how many support tickets come through daily (on average)? (give me a better perspective to sympathize :)

I do recall a warning message which I ignored to my detriment because it was the first time it happened. Also, "when they process the buy" is subject to manipulation - don't you think?

Just putting an idea out hoping for comments that will help form it. Not sure if any design types hang out on reddit :) --- anyway, ultimately you'd design a whole set ( say, 1/2, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, 1/1000,000, Satoshi)
