Is it good though? If people fall for stupid advertising, that's because they're stupid. Why does facebook feel a need to hold everybody's hand? It's their company, they can do what they like… I just think it's lame and condescending to their user base.

If you are correct about this rather grandiose claim that bitcoin will, "bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us." - Don't you think those elites are going to try to kill it before that happens? Maybe they can't stop it, but they can sure make a lot of trouble for people by *trying* to stop it.

Ok fair enough.
Anyhow, happy holidays. I'm going to go talk shit at some communists instead, they're easier to rile up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:12:58
Really?! That's basically the first thing I learned about bitcoin when I got interested 3 years ago. *Don't let someone else hold your cash*. Why are people not getting this message?
I still have a lot I'm trying to learn about btc because it is a complex world and as someone with no background in any sort of computer science, a lot of the lingo is very tough for me to follow. But that part just seems obvious. C'mon guys.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:01:33
Good point. Interesting to see both sides of this discussion. As someone who really doesn't know shit about economics, both arguments seem fairly compelling to me.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:12:06
Not to be argumentative but that actually runs counter to my philosophy. I think many of the complex things in the world (economics being one) likely can’t be reduced to one view which is correct while all others are wrong. Or maybe to be more precise - it is *usually* a bad idea to commit to firm belief in either side, because our human knowledge and ability to break down such gigantic concepts and come up with a ‘right’ answer is not nearly adequate for the job.

Being free of the shackles of a post-national oligarchy will probably be good for their currency, not bad.

Why do dumb comments like this get upvotes? It's a meme about the price of bitcoin dropping. How is that cultish?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:28:20
Normally I would let this go, but it's the last day before Christmas break and nobody wants to work, so things are very boring at the office. Therefore I intend to carry on this silly argument until 4pm central standard time.
On that note… is it that you don't like bitcoin, and you hover around this sub to remind us that we are brainwashed, kool-aid drinking drones? Or you do like bitcoin, but you're one of the 'cool, detached' people that doesn't follow the rest of us silly sheep blindly into the world of Will Ferrell memes? Or are you a shill for a competing cryptocurrency that has somehow convinced yourself our internet money is a scam and yours is the real deal?
I have a bit of bitcoin. I'm not obsessed with it. I thought it was a funny joke, based on a reality - lots of newbies are going to bail when it seems they are losing their asses. It's not like I upvoted it with the thought, "haha you fucking pussies, I'm gonna own you when bitcoins are worth a billion dollars."
Yeah the hodl meme in general is a part of 'bitcoin culture', but isn't that pretty natural that we would encourage people to hang on to their btc longer? I mean, it's worked out pretty well so far.

Wow, wasn't expecting that. That was like a speech to an army at the start of the french revolution or some shit. I dunno if I necessarily believe all of it, but it's inspiring haha.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:47:56
I actually replied to the wrong comment here. I meant it's interesting to see the debate between whether bitcoin's deflationary nature was economically a good or bad thing for its large scale adoption. The decimal place thing, I agree, is silly.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:52:07
Andreas’ first appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast is what alerted to bitcoin and made me buy in. I didn’t have much money at the time, so I couldn’t make a huge investment, but I bought what I could and needless to say that has worked out for me quite well. So yeah - thanks Andreas.

Well, glad our senate did something rad. Maybe we shouldn't eliminate them after all.

@_date: 2014-10-09 15:38:03
That's exactly what's great about our government. The senate does next to nothing except slow things down. The biggest endorsement I can give to our system of government is that it sucks at getting things done. Cuz when it does get things done, they're usually just meddling with things and wasting more money.

Interesting idea… but tell this to someone at the height of an acid trip. I think they'll laugh at the notion that bitcoin is comparable in any way.
I mean, I kinda get what you're saying as far as it disrupting social norms. But just to point out the obvious, acid is a potentially revolutionary experience for the soul. Bitcoin is… not.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:31:41
Avast, troll.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:43:53
Why are you browsing r/bitcoin if you hate it? Because you're a troll. Which is fine, the world needs trolls. But trolls need to be told to piss off too.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:59:17
This is fair. I have bought all my bitcoin from your site. It has been painless thus far, especially compared to your competition. I guess 10% just feels high when I know other sites are lower, but I understand that your business model is different. Keep doin what you're doin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:15:12
All of those require that you submit a driver's license. Nobody who just wants to dabble a bit in bitcoin and see what it's about is going to go through that.
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:13:50
Nope, it doesn't. "At this time, bank accounts and credit cards from your country cannot be linked to Circle".
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:04:05
As with many of these sites, the signup process *is* simple. The process of *actually buying*, is not. You need to upload your driver's license, deposit funds to their site, etc. People who just want to try out bitcoin as a sort of novelty are not going to do this.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:29:36
Oh! Good to know. Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:51:43
Thanks! Never got this before. Cool!
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:11:07
Oh puh-leeeeze. It's a hodl joke meme. You're basically saying that every time group 'a' pokes fun at group 'b' via a meme, group 'a' is now a cult.
Someone made a meme about people who don't signal in traffic? I guess people who upvote that now constitute a cult of people who use their turn signals.
We like bitcoin so we laughed at a joke about the people who sell when it gets tough. We're not sacrificing virgins to the god of cryptocurrency here.

14 million people still watch that rubbish show? Sad!

As a layman who uses bitcoin, but doesn't have much knowledge of computer science type stuff, and doesn't really get the mining side of it all, can someone give me an unbiased ELI5 of this controversy?
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:41:12
There may be some good points in here, but it's hard to take an article seriously when it is so rife with grammatical errors.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:57:46
Yeah, I've spoken to some other people who have advised me similarly, I'm looking into that now. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:59:22
Yeah, it's a bit of an echo chamber in here, so I'm not surprised a lot of people say, "don't sell". Much as I am a bitcoin fan, I'm not totally convinced that governments / large banking institutions (is there a difference?) won't step in at some point and find a way to destroy it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:57:02
Haha. I wish I had enough bitcoin to get out of debt. But it's enough to make a nice little dent in it at least :)
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:24:34
I've learned not to tell my friends and family how much bitcoin value has increased lately, because their response is always, "You better sell it now before it goes back down."
@_date: 2016-07-11 04:50:56
What about if bitcoin really catches on and in 2020 or 2024 a US government administration is elected that sees it as a threat (since it's so much more difficult for them to manipulate) and decides to undermine it? I know they can't really *get rid of it*, but they can make laws and turn public opinion against it. A steep decline in usage *after* having attained mass adoption would make it seem irrelevant. Then they talk China into doing the same and it's essentially DOA.
