So IF:  MArk lost his passwords, what suggestions or remedys to help him remember?  
I have a hard drive that's encrypted and I forgot the password, I've spent a long time on it and still haven't gotten it exactly right, I remember some parts though.
What do you do, to help remember something important that you have "temporarily" forgotten  (as in "temporarily unavailable")  
I believe he forgot/lost the password more than the story of a leak/theft.
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:42:04
So I take it you had 5.000001 bitcoins?

Banks can blow billions or trillions of dollar debts.

Had they gone to the taxpayers or citizens, it would be immediately injected into the economy 10 fold.
Bitcoins are the way to say, we're done with banks...

It's like passing the keys to Ft.Knox to someone else...
The Gold or whatever is in there, is still there, not moving, untouched, just someone else has the keys.  
It's as good as the title to your house or car, it's the proof of ownership.
I could lease out the keys to Ft.Knox for a lot of money, the list of people who can't access thier assets won't be able to recieve them *cough cough* GERMANY *ahem* and the rabbit hole gets deeper.

I would write a letter of what I want to say, add it into the blockchain, and send that satoshi to Mr.Karpeles, if we could know his personal address...  (if only). Included in the letter will be a link to the voicemail so he can listen to it instead of reading it.   
I'm working on a site to collect thoughts like this and your words, messages, and emotions...  All for Mr. Karpeles.
We deserve to be heard by him.

Mark, why don't you come over to my house and we'll smoke a few bowls together and have a great time, you're probably really a great buddy to hang with...

There's a few posts regarding maxd out limits for banking
and that they explain the whole point of bitcoin to the banks when they open thier new accounts across Europe.
It's given, banks do not support bitcoin.  This is likely the friction people saw with withdrawls/deposits.  Could internal bank memos require delayed transfers when dealing with gox?
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:45:56
So is the whole thing a rick roll?   
or was it a message from the real karpeles to say, I'm protecting someone/something?
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:14:43
What if they are somehow related?
Mark I think I want my money back...

It's fitting in a few ways.
1. The 1 million Mt.Gox customers
2. Karpeles is French. The French have attitudes of Americans in Normandy, of all places... If not for American lives sacrificed on D-Day, they would all be speaking German.

Dear Mr. Karpeles,
Thank you for making a public press conference.  This is a great step in the right direction towards resolution.  I hope that you can continue to be as forthcoming to the public and the account holders as you showed today.
If restructuring GOX into a publicly held company is a viable option, I hope very much that the account holders are given a fair share of the new company and a little extra for the problems caused, if the bitcoin and cash balances can not be restored.  
I hope that GOX will rise from the ashes like a Pheonix and become stronger than ever with the proper management team.  Certainly it is possible.  
Good Luck &amp; Thanks again for today.
Sincerely, 
Your Customer

I think I'd be working on a solution...    
I was told it's impossible! to recover this trashed hard drive a few years back.  Not even gov organizations could recover they say... These 3 guys were on the winning defcon hacker jeopardy team.  
I managed them with question/answer and my hexadecimal calculator in my palm os and a few utilities, after about a day &amp; a half we got it.   
I know keys are more challenging, (ok I'll say it "impossible") but I'd love to dig into it if Mark really has this problem.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:58:56
If this is the case, not telling the public would ensure the security of the bitcoins being on a misplaced hard drive?
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:12:18
Maybe your anger towards other people would change after you go piss on a transformer station &amp; have a nice day!

Dear MtGox Customers,
I personally believe that MtGox Customers are unable to communicate with Mark Karpeles, CEO of MtGox. It is my intention to collect your grievances, stories, and emotions, in order to make them publicly viewable for MtGox &amp; Mr. Karpeles.
Furthermore, I would like to kindly ask that people refrain from asking questions to our staff: they have been instructed not to give any response or information. Please visit this page for further announcements and updates.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:22:16
no?  where's he at?
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:56:42
Perhaps Mark suffered a tiny siezure from flashing lights on his computer screen in a strobe effect while he was writing the key for the cold storage, then blink blink blink, boom, the key was written and he pressed ENTER inadvertantly...  
Hidden in his memory, under hypnosis, can reveal the true events of what occurred.
QUESTION:  Has Mark undergone hypnosis to determine if he has forgotten any events related to the missing coins?
p.s.  A nice Thank You, to the new visitors at

@_date: 2014-02-27 23:55:25
We need to know what he knows before we could think what a fair punishment is.
I say, give him a real incentive to share the truth to the world.
Seriously, someone force him to share the whole truth.  Give him a polygraph and a brain scan lie detector, on video!
It could be pay per view, with bitcoins, to support the victims.  Then, the victims can call in and ask questions, for more bitcoins, of course.  Finally, he'll be put into the worlds first Running Man (see the movie), which you can watch via pay per view / bitcoins.
Give it to Netflix.  
Netflix, meet Mark Karpeles, &amp; Bitcoin.

If I stole an ouce of gold (in the form of a gold eagle 1 oz coin) in 1922 and I am ordered to pay it back today?
I'll gladly pay you back the value of the gold from when it was stolen, which was $20.
My view, It should be paid back in the way it was left in the account.
If you had 99 bitcoins and 14 cents, that's what you get back.
If you had 35,000 dollars and .9 bitcoins, that's what you should get back.
your property should be returned in the condition in which you left it.
Do you want to write a letter to MArk Karpeles? visit  and feel better about it!
