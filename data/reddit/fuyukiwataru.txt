There seems to be a lot of Gold in this reddit. What has this world come to?!

Unfortunately there are still a lot of teen run Bitcoin exchanges out there. People don't realize that in some parts of the world Bitcoin is not recognized, and people can easily steal your coins and you will never get them back. Not to mention that some of these exchanges are not even registered as a real company!!
Use Coinbase, BTC-E (even though their anonymous, I wouldn't recommend enormous amounts) and your own USB stick or paper wallet.
Hopefully in a few years the rotten exchanges will gone, and the legit ones will strife.

Because you posted this with your main reddit account you will become a target.
I suggest you start lockin' your doors boy!

Ross has plenty enough Bitcoins stashed around in private wallets. He also has plenty of 'friends' left who also became very rich thanks to his website, and who have enormous amounts of Bitcoins. Why should we donate when he's a bitcoin millionare with bitcoin millionare buddies? And don't bs me that he 'aint got no money' because he was willing to pay $80,000 USD for a murder. A kid at that age doesn't have $80,000.
 
I respect the guy for creating a huge project, but the power went to his head and he got caught. I don't believe he deserves full life time in prison though, maybe 3-6 years. But yeah, America's law system is a joke. Good luck

All I can remember is that the length of the password must have been around around 12-17 characters, with one number in or near the end and possibly a '!' and it's supposed to be a dutch sentence. But I can't remember what I wrote down, honestly.
I hope this might help a bit...

Why do you list your amount of money ?
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:29:35
All I can say is that by selling the coins, the prise was to drop making panic sellers sell their coins, making it even a stronger 'swing' going down. 
While the price was low, immense buys would be created, and making those who sold their coins, to jump back in. Making the price shoot straight up again, hoping that more people would jump in and it would swing above the price it originally. 
It's a swing effect.

This website is dangerous and I do not recommend you to use it.
There are many other alternatives out there that are less risky. Chose wisely ;-)

Like it a lot.

Wasn't this extension created by a moderator from the Litecoin community?
@_date: 2014-01-11 12:56:07
It's just the beginning boy.
@_date: 2014-11-26 13:43:37
Thanks! Added it

These foundations where you have to pay to enter, are a joke. 
There should be a community wide chosen Bitcoin Ambassadors group that shares the idea of Bitcoin to the world. 
A non-profit organization with it's upkeep solely through Bitcoin donations.

Ooops deleted my previous post.
The FBI claimed they took his Bitcoins. They got 80 mil worth of Bitcoins. Don't tell me they just 'found' it somewhere, they took it from him, that seems to be the only explanatory thing.
The only person I feel sorry for is the sister, who will never see her brother again.

The price will drop to around 7$ again, better sell before your stuck holding the bag.

I cashed a lot of coins out, but bought or kept a few for a friend of mine.
I had them stored on BTC-E, or he had them stored on his BTC-E account and when he wanted to sell them he couldn't figure out how the bitcoin wallet worked. I offered my help and told him to transfer the coins to me, my wallet. I would then transfer the coins to a Dutch exchange who bought the coins. 
Unfortunately I found out that I couldn't transfer the coins to the Dutch exchange because I had a password! So I ended up paying my friend 140 euro out of my own pocket.

Thanks, I just mailed them!

Invest in start up companies that will help and improve the Bitcoin community.

It´s interesting how one small ´bad´ news rumor (yes rumor) can make the market go down so fast.
And where plenty of very good news rumors, or facts (like the past few days, companies accepting bitcoin etc) no longer effects the price at all. At least that's what I'm seeing. Which might also be good, this shows that the coin is stable.
I don't believe this FUD, this is the 22th time I've heard that Bitcoin will be banned or whatsoever in China. It's just people hoping that it does, so they can buy loads at a cheaper price.
Besides, how big was this exchange anyways and why are  the other exchanges not having the same issues? There are some Chinese exchanges who are notorious for their lying and manipulation in data. Who knows this website might just be trying to steer the price down.
 
See you all when it goes back to 450.

Not really. The Netherlands is a tax heaven, you don't have to pay any tax at all, maybe only 0.5% or 1%. There are a lot of companies in the world (starbucks etc) who have The Netherlands, and Amsterdam as their headquaters. It's actually just a mailbox, not even a headquater at all.
Also this is pretty old, like 1-2 weeks now?

Nice infographic, but Kraken is way over rated in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:01:10
15$ per hour? You gotta start from scratch, and build up your reputation. So start with at least $5 per hour.
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:00:51
What happened? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:32:56
Can confirm, it's down for a while now.
They were also, as far as I know, and correct me if I'm wrong; the only exchange in China who was still accepting BTC/LTC/XRP for CNY. 
Maybe they used the bad news of the other exchanges who couldn't accept money at this moment, to get people to invest in their exchange to eventually run off with the cash? 
Of course this is very extreme, but you can never be sure, specially with Bitcoin =]
Happy trading!

To me this letter seems more like a begging ''please let me join you so I can make profit as well'' then an actual support letter.
Leave the guy alone, he's got enough money to hire the best lawyer in the world, he will be fine

Start a bitcoin investment group.
It's not super hard to make profit with cryptocurrencies. Just buy at the low, and sit there for a few months.

Hmm... Just a general question; If I receive around 50,000 in bitcoins on my bank account, and I transfer it to another bank account, which is outside of my country, how long would it take for it to arrive ?
I have no issues with BTC-E and I can turn my BTC into cash within 2 hours.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:35:01
No it can't, just read the post. Lol, it made no sense.
I will contact the tax office later.

I sell and buy bitcoins for my trusted partners who live in the states. This way they don't have to wait weeks for their money or bitcoins.
I can confirm that bitonic.nl is legit, and it's my favorite website by far.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:00:17
If only more people would see the benefit of Bitcoin.

They didn't.
