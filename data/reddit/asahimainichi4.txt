thanks for the reply, I see your point.
i suppose  in some sense there is no strict security against double spending if someone is rich enough? if the number of bitcoins you own is more than the cost of running 51% of the mining network (I guess there are a few people at this level), then you can in principle gain money by double spending just one transaction? Or even if you dont own that much, if you can control the network, and then just keep doubling your BTC holdings via double spends to gain cash and buy BTC, until you break even?

I am not an expert, but I always assumed the security was related to the cost of controlling more than 51% of the mining network.   thus, there is an assumption (though perhaps this is not true in practise, but might be true in the strict definition of security) that the cost (ultimately in energy) of controlling more than 51% of the network has to be higher than the value of the transactions in the block?
You could counter argue that the act of stealing the transactions would simultaneously destroy their value.  or that, if one controlled that much of the mining effort, it would be better long-term gain to maintain trust and reap the bitcoin reward. 
 still, doesn't the whole security of the blockchain in some sense rely on this "cost" being high, which means the energy cost of verification must always increase as the value of the transactions in a block increase?
I feel like I may have misunderstood something, so wanted to ask someone about this.

yeah, i guess in the end there is a "game theoretic" aspect to the security.  Thanks for the great explanations.
