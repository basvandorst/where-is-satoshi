Or just run a Tor bridge because that's exactly what they're made for, or an SSH tunnel because duh.

Great, except for the fact that you couldn't of signed a key in 2011 with a key generated in 2014 (Sure, you *technically* could, but I highly doubt they did).

Should of gone through with the sale, spend a few hours asking about all kinds of things, "What's WhoIS, WHAT DO YOU MEAN PEOPLE CAN SEE MY INFORMATION? I HAVE TO PAY YOU FOR PRIVACY? You're blackmailing me!", then finally get to the "Okay, what's your Bitcoin address?" and terminate the sale once they can't give you one, "But I thought you accepted it?".

What do you mean 'a payment page'?

Absolutely nothing for you, but it allows people who do want to stay anonymous (I.E. People who legally can't use Bitcoin and/or people who don't want to be tied to Bitcoin) still reach out to the Clearnet's blocks &amp; transactions.

In a sense, everywhere accepts Bitcoins because you can exchange BTC for USD then buy whatever.

It was clearly a beta at all points. If you even remotely followed their Github page you would of seen this.

Looking at the screenshots, you don't have the private key, and that's why you don't use Blockchain.info's receive API.
Use something with a seeded wallet and keep the watch only wallet on your server. For now, you'll have to wait seven days then email Blockchain. Why wait seven days? Because Blockchain's API is slow as all hell.

Don't. Just ship new ones with *NIX, give it ten years, problem solved.

If that's what you're looking for, then unfortunately, it's also on their Github page, so, I guess you won't be able to donate.

They have the private key, they can manually forward the funds.

Remember to run a hidden service on that bad-boy, I'm doing something like that myself:-

No, if you run `gpg --verify` then paste the full email in and hit ctrl+d, you'll get something like:-




The PGP key is obviously that of someone recent, not of whoever sent it in 2011.

I've still not installed the update since it's started requesting GPS access.
No. I'll stick with GPS-free versions thankyouverymuch.

[Arch install](
Linux install:-
1. Acquire git, libssl-dev (OpenSSL's headers), python2, pip (for python2).
2. Git their [GitHub page]( (`git clone 
3. `pip -r install requirements.txt` (Although, if your package manager has these addons, or you're using Arch (And have the AUR), I really recommend using that, not pip, it allows easy management).
4. `pip install pysqlcipher`
4. ./run.sh
