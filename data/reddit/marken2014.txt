The head of Cboe “we will tame the price of bitcoin.” when they realized the price of bitcoin is too expensive to buy for any institution. Cboe started in December 2017 they announce it just 3 weeks before it went live. In that 3 weeks from Nov 30, 2017 to Dec 18, 2017 the price of bitcoin go up from under $10,000 to $20,000.
What do we do? C ask
Let buy as much bitcoin we can and run the price to monumental value, price get to $20,000 
Now let's sell the bitcoin we accumulate. 
Sell the underline as we see it fit and short on future market from $20,000+ down to... and make as much money we can.   
 
Price go from 20000 to 6000  
 
Now the price is low institution like Bakkt, ICE, Bank and all other institution buy every bitcoin they can get from people who must sell to support their life and pay bills, who happen to be the early adopter and the innovator. also due to the price drop some will give up and sell more.   
 
Ok but not enough. where can we get more liquidity?  
 
Let control the narrative.  how?     
 
let's giving out false hope and say we will start ETF soon, when everyone focused on that and forgets the real value of bitcoin, and think ETF is the main reason why bitcoin exist, we just come out and say O no, not now. will do it several times and give different reasons.  
 
we are starting ETF O no we can't, ok now we will next month O no we just pulled out our application ok we applied again.  Get it  
 
Ok now it looks like everyone who is going to sell, sold already   
 
Let's think about this. C ask  
 
If the price go up from this point and we can't sell the underline to control the price it will be bad for us, if someone go long in the future what can we do?  
 
WE WILL NO LONGER OFFER FUTURE.
I’m Just speculating, Maybe the price of bitcoin goes down just because, one of the beast innovation in human history has no use.
