Because he's not the sort of person who thinks that far ahead?  Seriously, just send a message to the moderators about what is happening instead of helping them spam.

What is Theymos's agenda?
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:04:54
I know a hard sell when I see one.
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:05:43
Who is in charge of Classic, who holds the keys?

If you google the link and click the article from search results, it will bypass the paywall.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:54:28
I don't mean to trust you with the code.   Are you the one running the bitcoinclassic website that is supposed to show us what the majority supposedly wants?  That is what I mean by trust.  How can we be sure that this consensus platform won't be gamed by the few?
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:42:37
Nothing to be ashamed of, if you did, you would know that stereotype is not really true.
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:21:04
That's straight up theft.  Even Coinbase lets you take your coins elsewhere if they decide you are a high risk customer and you don't want to comply.

1) Don't buy more bitcoin than you can afford to lose, ever.
  
2) In case you don't understand  don't spend bill money on bitcoin.
  
3) Don't ever fucking spend your rent money on bitcoin.
  
4) Nobody can answer your question, it could never reach that price again or it could reach it as soon as I submit this comment.

I'm confused too.  Is he talking about having more than one active chain of the bitcoin blockchain or something else?
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:36:51
Is there a copy of  somehwere?
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:01:50
 It looks like this is run by [Jonathan Toomim](  But he is a small miner offering cloud mining because he gets cheap energy from hydro access.  How has he come to be offering this solution and why on earth would we trust him?

He is not pro single client as best I can see.  He appears to be pro non-hardfork client without what he calls consensus and I don't see a good option for arriving at consensus unless a whole bunch of big players in the community step up and offer to poll their customers who are enumerated.  Companies like Coinbase could easily help in this arena by polling their customers and fighting for what their customers want.  They have a huge population and actively de-duplicate accounts.  They could even extend their verification efforts via api to other efforts like "Classic" to help weight the votes.

You don't know many gay people do you?  
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:23:45
They shouldn't be allowed to get away with extorting your personal information.  It sounds like some sort of entrapment but I am not a lawyer.
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:50:07
Voting can be gamed so lets make a poll?  What the hell...
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:23:15
You're right, this is an important distinction.  That was my first impression and I know better than to not look further.
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:34:49
That really isn't clear but someone messaged me the answer I was looking for.  
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:26:01
I hope they don't filter a discussion trying to get to the bottom of who is driving classic when they are constantly being bombarded by it.
  
I truly respect everyone's right to privacy but I care a lot about bitcoin and want to know everything I can about people trying to change it and why.
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:43:38
This is the conclusion I am also leaning towards and it is forcing me to reconsider my patronage.  They are putting me in a position to have to take a stand and stop using them, and to stop recommending them and to start a dialogue with those I have recommended use them.

Using a system that is flawed can and will have flawed results, especially when money is involved.  Account age is terrible since you can have as many accounts as you want and this would just give a handful of people the majority of voice.  People who don't understand this, which I believe to be most people, will be easily led as a result.
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:31:01
I have and I sound similar without the lisp.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:46:52
I'm describing my thought process.  I only use coinbase to acquire bitcoin and I could go other places for that.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:51:29
He did.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:32:02
Where is the proof that they are directly related?  I have seen none.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:59:17
The cavefish lose their sight for turning their back on the light.  To betray the light is to lose your sight.
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:04:44
They may end up getting more business if people feel that being a customer of theirs helps drive the direction of bitcoins consensus.  So far, we are seeing a few people speaking for many people, just like our current 1% vs. 99% climate that precipitated bitcoin to begin with.

Can the RBF features be patched-out later if they prove to be a problem without much changes?  Or is there a way to turn off RBF support in this version if it is needed?

Forcing someone into hiding can be a desirable effect.  Thanks I'll check it out.
