This happened to me... right now. My money is gone and there are no coins. I think I will be needing to contact my bank about this.

CoinBase! I'm honestly super confused. I Just made a account. Just decided to get into the 'bitcoin' investing. Just transfered 95$ to Electrum then went to verify and I receive a message of them saying my account needs to be closed. Don't get it. Is this even normal? I need to find another place to get coins from, that's for sure.
I'm a bit paranoid now worried about my coin that I'd just sent through to my wallet 10 or so mins before I went to verify. Hopefully pushing that 'button' means that it will end up in my wallet no matter what. I'll just bite my nails for the next 24 hours.

This is the message I'm staring at now: 
I'll twiddle my thumbs now. It's nearly 2am where I am at. I'll probably have to call them in the morning in the meantime I'll stare at my wallet until I fall asleep. :(

The coins are in my wallet! I ended up going to sleep late and waking up late due to my panicking. According the the blockchain it took 93 conformations and three transactions. I honestly don't fully understand what that means or why it never showed my wallet receiving address but thank goodness it went through. 
Did your coins make there way to your pocket? I'd like you to have good news as well. And thank you by the way. Thanks to you I was able to at least sleep! I'm going to spend more time on this reddit and researching things a bit more (need to find another place to purchase coins from first)  and understand how to not get your account cancelled on other sites.
Not going to give up. I only learned that you are suppose to take the coins out of the 'online wallet' (or whatever it's called) from reading stuff here. :)

It appeared. It took 93 conformations for some reason but it appeared in my wallet at 04:39 this morning. But thankfully it's there. I would have hated to have just tried my hand at bitcoins only to lose money instantly. Yes this is a risk and I didn't need that money hence me investing it but that would have really hurt.

I was able to download my transaction history, at the bottom of the page there was a download button. I'm confused by the results. I see where I purchases 100$ of bitcoins with my debit card- the fees knocked that down to 95$.
I was able to place the address into the blockchain website.  It shows up as a bunch of stuff I don't understand. I think it's against forum rule to post the address unless asked so I'll reframe unless someone does. 
It's showing 2  Transactions and $ 70.54 total received then final balance Zero... 
I'm so not ready for this bitcoin thing. I should of researched more. :/

Did... you get your money back? Please tell me yes. I'm still waiting. I sent it to my wallet over a hour ago and so far nothing. I'm clearly not ready for bitcoins. That's for sure...
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:32:08
Ah, ok. This means I should probably get off the computer and go to bed. :/ Still panicking like a stupid child though. 
I was able to download my transaction history. I place the address of my last transaction into the blockchain. I don't understand what any of it means though. I didn't even see my electrum wallet address there, but then again I don't know if it's suppose to be there!
Geez, never again Coinbase. Never again. I hope your coins show up. I really do. Please share the good news when it does. Maybe I'll share the same good news too...
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:03:27
Yes I think you are right. :)

One moment!

Wouldn't it be nice if they told me exactly what I did? Like...
You transferred coins to the Roy Moore campaign fund?
You've transferred bitcoins to a foreign government and are clearly in violation of the USA constitution...
Okay now on a serious note do you have any idea what you may have done? Cause I'm still lost as a kite in the wind. Thankfully though my coins HAVE appeared in my wallet. I'm beyond relieved. I'm going to research this reddit some more and find another service like coinbase. Then research a bit more after this just to be safe since clearly I haven't researched coins enough to get into the investment thing.

Sadly I'm 31 I take no offense this happens a lot. I wish it were the underage thing. It would at least make sense. Honestly though, I don't care much about the closed account now... just about that 95$. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:41:46
Yes... I'm going to sound like the whiny woman that I am but I'm really paranoid. Maybe I should of researched bitcoins a bit more. I thought I read up enough on here and was ready to drop a little money to see how it goes. 
I can't get back into the account. It takes me to a 'withdrawn' screen. Then spams my phone with 'verify' code so I can withdraw the .51 cents left. Then I couldn't even withdraw that because it's too small? 
Ugh... Just let that 95$ end up in my wallet. If only I had a way to see the blockchain but Coinbase won't let me.
