Inside jobs are still a possibility... You could beef up your security all you want but if an inside job is pretty hard to protect against.

I'm a venezuelan and a huge crypto currencies advocate, i'm a student, i have a sick dad and thanks to crypto currencies, especially bitcoin, i'm able to bring some sort of monthly income to help around the house, discovering local bitcoins last year is the best thing that has happened to me this last decade. Now i try to spread the word and i'm getting some family members and friends into cryptos and the few that have managed to make the jump are quite happy with the gains so far, i just sometimes struggle in trying to explain crypto currencies to technology illiterate people but i try my best.

You are right, i completely forgot that i had to do a full cycle and convert into their fiat and then convert their fiat into my fiat to buy more bitcoin, i would probably lose more money doing the conversions that what i would gain unless you had contacts on the African country side of things to get better conversion rates.

I don't know if there are any charities in my country that accept bitcoin, but it would be great if you could donate some to any organization bringing medicines/food into Venezuela, there are people starving and dying out of stupid curable diseases thanks to the mediocrity of the government and their crazy money printing habits, i know crypto currencies are a success and will continue to win thanks to my experience here with the venezuelan central bank and their crazy money printing.

Go into localbitcoins and search for venezuelan transactions in VEF thousands of users buying and selling daily and the number keeps going up, im happy to admit that i have helped around 9 people to get into btc tru localbitcoins :-)

So bitcoin right now is at 17$, what are we going to do when 1 bitcoin hits 17k usd again? Are we going to start using satoshis? Cuz i really want to use satoshis instead :-D

You are right, we actually live in a socialist paradise and the USA media wants you to believe we are not cuz they hate us cuz they anus.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:12:45
If i where a person with no morals, what are my incentives to NOT buy bitcoin and sell them to african countries market places for a 40% mark up?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:40:38
I hope they are right, but will they eat each others dick if they are not?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:07:17
Interesting maybe we can get a tipping culture going on? The best thing about bitcoin is the freedom you get when you own it :-)
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:39:07
I want a job that pays in btc too :-)
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:56:54
Yes we are, we are the fastest growing community in localbitcoins and most people i know buy, hold and then sell there, i've myself converted at least 10 people into buying bitcoin using localbitcoins and with the rise of the price of btc + the devaluation of the bolivar, you can double your money in 2-3 weeks, even less. You might say well you are doubling bolivars which is an useless currency and you're right but we are doing way better than those that choose to keep their money on the bank.

Probably too much traffic since the interest in cryptos is growing exponentially many sites are even starting to limit registration until they are able to properly scale.

You dropped your /s somewhere along the way.

No one likes beggars anyways, if you want to get value give some value to the community first.

Why are they wasting time working on something that already exists? lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:07:35
There are some other interesting projects out there that could survive like IOTA and call me silly but ive been a science enthusiast all my life and einsteineum has really picked my interest, especially if they go the way the community wants which is that every now and then coin holders would be able to vote together to finance certain scientific projects...
Tl;Dr : the big ones and a few really focused on certain fields coins may survive. Except dash, dash will probably die if the lightning network is what we want it to be.

I'm not sure this guy gets what the point of btc is...
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:17:25
Are you implying Satoshi is a reptilian that created the big bitcoin ponzi scheme to collect funds to create a pro reptilian faction on earth and fund them tru bitcoin to then proceed with the planned reptilian invasion of earth in 2021?

I live in Venezuela and btc is far from being a street currency yet, but its slowly being adopted in mercadolibre(its basically ebay) more and more, i've seen many postings accepting bsf and btc, eth and litecoin. I'm doing my best to get family and friends in early thou.

Is this the one i've been reading about that you have to use at the top of the hour because it gets filled real fast?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:12:04
Instead of going around and begging why dont you at least try to create something useful for the community or at least memes to try and get some tips at least...

I've been using bittrex for around a month and i think its pretty good, i love the variety of coins you have there and i have had no issues so far with it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:31:24
Check out bittrex, its the one i use and it has plenty of coins.

If you believe you are right you don't need to commit such petty acts to prove it... And doing that is brigading and thats against reddit rules....

The crime and terrorism argument against bitcoin has always been stupid to me, people use the usd daily to commit crimes, terrorism, drug deals, etc... And i dont see anyone saying the usd is dangerous because it is used for crime and other purposes worldwide.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:46:13
I've seen some people picking up ethereum, but its not as big as btc yet.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:28:14
Should we worry? No lol. Check crypto calendar, i can't provide a link cuz im on mobile but i swear there are like 5 new btc forks this december-january.

VEF the bolivar fuerte, venezuela monopoly currency. (Or bullshit fiat kek)
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:03:28
You are right, we have bigger issues here in venezuela, but for some people btc is turning out to be a great method to fight agaisnt our rampant inflation in the short and mid term, most of venezuela's btc users are not long term hodlers rather buy 1 day and sell in 2-3 weeks when you need the money to buy food.
