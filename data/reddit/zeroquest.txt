Clarification: This isn't ALL you need, right? You'd still need the motor and some other parts?

I agree with much of what you said. But for many $5 here or there is a drop in the bucket. And there are PLENTY of examples of indie developers coming up with incredible games. For some, this may help fund those endeavors. I look at it as helping out someone that otherwise may be ignored. With that said, I don't just toss around money either. If the games don't look even the slightest bit entertaining, I'll usually pass. (Even if I'll never play them, they need to at least catch my eye)
tl;dr: I'm paying it forward in hopes "this" indie developer will make the next big indie game.

What percentage of PC sales (Those that read those bullet points) are miners?
Somehow I doubt Nintendo cares about a GPU that would probably outclass anything they manufacture for the next 10 years. (Yeah, that was sarcasm, maybe 5 years.) ;)

Why wouldn't they? That's a pretty short time-span to lie about.

I think it's a bit naive to assume linear growth for 50 years. Granted that has been the case for quite some time, but 50 years is a HUGE amount of time. In the last several years we've gone from solo-core cpu's to multi-core cpu's due to the stagnation of linear growth on a single-core processor. With that said, Intel has recently announced 1,000 core CPU's are possible now and what's preventing 10,000, 100,000 or more core cpu's in 10-20 years?


This also assumes cracking of SHA256 doesn't become much easier. Again just hypothesizing.
With that said, I'm all for bitcoin - it'll be quite some time before this becomes an issue. I believe it will if bitcoin does become more widespread in the future.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but let's say SHA256 were to be cracked. Doesn't this mean someone could download already completed blocks and crack them instantly? Thus completely screwing up the bitcoin economy overnight? Since duplicates could be easily created? (Again, I'm just curious, I really don't completely understand the process.)

Don't get me wrong, would be great if that was the outcome, but don't count on it. Also takes a lot of effort to cross the line and be 'ok' with doing shit like that...

Resilient? Sure.
Bulletproof? Doubt it.
We really can't begin to guess what kind of horsepower will be out there 5 or 10 years from now. Imagine 20 years? 20 years ago we were using 10Mhz processors putting out infinitely less horsepower than today.
With that said, I really don't understand the cryptography behind bitcoins, so I can't speak to how difficult cracking it would be. If the method evolves with time, then it could remain uncrackable.
Someone with more understanding please chime in as I'm interested as well.

Gox was hacked. The currency is seeing major attention. If you believe in BTC, then you believe things will stabilize.
IMO, this is growing pains, nothing else. With mining difficulty going up and attention increasing exponentially, BTC is almost guaranteed to go up.

Yup that's it. My mistake.

So it's real then?
@_date: 2011-06-21 19:50:02
This is what I was thinking when I said:


I'm definitely NOT trying to discredit the bitcoin encryption. I'm merely trying verify it's validity moving forward. If it's something that's cracked in 20 years (Yes, I realize this is likely impossible) it's still so far out to be meaningless. If a method is devised, it'll likely shorten the time to crack, not eliminate it entirely.

The reality is that btc are becoming 'real' and any action is better than none. The more activity the more people will take it seriously. If you want more vendors to accept btc, then the economy has to grow. Look at the interest over the last several weeks, more and more businesses are beginning to accept btc. Sure some are for exposure, but that'll subside as the currency is taken more seriously.

Use this chart and sort by Mh/J
5770's seem to be the card of choice. However with the current speed of mining, if you don't hit it hard and fast, it's not going to be worth it in a couple months.
Personally I'm buying 3 cards tomorrow (2 x 5770 and a 5850 - I have one already) my (modest) goal is 50-100 BTC to stash on a memory stick for long-term. Anything else I make will be spent to help the BTC economy.
BTW: I'm getting 392Mh/s with my solo 5850 @ 985 clock / 300 Memory / 1.2v. Goal is just over 1,000Mh/s with the hope of hitting 100 Coins before it's too late/expensive.
Good Luck

In all fairness you gave that impression. ;)

Make sure your client has reached the block number of your transfer. If not, it won't show up. Make sure port 8332 is open, 8 connections is typical of a machine behind a firewall. Good luck

You really don't "get" hackers, do you? They're not in it to "work", it's short-term, grab what you can gains. A few thousand is "worth it" to them. Once they get that, they could care less what happens to BTC.

Growing pains

I used it on an existing install w/out a problem, but I don't blame you. I backed up my existing files and replaced just the two with the ones in the archive. I've done it multiple times, but honestly I don't want you pissed at me if it doesn't work, so proceed with caution.
My other suggestion: Did yo forward port 8332 on your router? If you're only getting 8 (magical behind firewall number) connections on your bitcoin client, open the port and it'll download MUCH MUCH faster.
