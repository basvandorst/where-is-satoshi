I'm not arguing that. I'm saying that Bitcoin Core wallet software is not a tool for consumers to use directly. Just like Apache is not a tool for consumers, yet the websites that run on top of it are.
Lightning Network wallets are one of the solutions to the problems you mentioned for consumers.

And the more BTC in your channels. 
You can only send as much BTC at a time through a channel as the amount of BTC the channel was initially funded with.
Being a node is for people with enough BTC to provide enough liquidity so that they can afford to pay the on chain fees to do channel rebalancing when their channels get emptied.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:48:43
You of course need PoW. You need the bitcoin block chain to guarantee all of your LN contracts.
The liquidity providers do on chain transactions to rebalance channels, and they pay for their transactions by charging you a very small fee whenever you want to route a payment through their channels. Anyone can be a liquidity provider.
Your concerns are unfounded, I suggest you read more about LN.


No, the Lightning Network is a *network* of channels between many nodes. You connect to the network with 1 channel (power users might use more than 1, but 1 is all you need). Then you can send payment through channels from node to node until your coins reach their destination. Your LN wallet does this automatically.
There's also an infographic on the front page right now explaining:
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:32:36
So is your argument that LN won't happen?
Segwit has only existed for 5 months and it was kind of a surprise.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:40:50
They are basically channels that can be used to create new channels on LN without an on chain transaction.
They are channels that have "child channels" that don't last forever but also don't need any on chain fee to open.
Channel factories won't be available for a long while. I would guess 2 years.

A LN wallet functions pretty much the same as a bitcoin wallet today, except with instant confirmations and very low fees.
This way you have the security and price of a bitcoin, but with high scalability, high speed (no confirmations needed) and low cost.
Actually I've yet to see a popular altcoin offer this same service. They all seem to need confirmations and on chain transactions, but maybe you can prove me wrong?
By the way, most people do not have bitcoin in a bitcoin core wallet. Do you realize how hard it is to use that wallet compared to a bitcoin wallet on your phone, or to a light wallet like electrum?

And I'm just pointing out that you don't need to "open and close a channel" for coffee purchases with the coffee shop.

We obviously don't know what the multiplier in real life will be but perhaps a 1.7mb block with LN can do what a 170mb block without LN can do.
Then a 1mb increase to blocksize later would equate to something like a 100mb increase without LN.

In essence is right thought. Most normal end users will do 99.99% of their transactions off-chain. Or even 100% of transactions, perhaps not even needing an initial channel funding transaction because a channel factory would be used to open their first LN wallet and they would buy LN coins to get started, instead of doing an on chain BTC purchase.
Power users and liquidity providers will be using on chain transactions. "Normal" end consumers won't need to. They will always still have the full backing of the bitcoin block chain to guarantee them that their coins are available to them through an on chain transaction if they ever needed it. But that guarantee in itself will usually be enough to prevent them from ever needing an on chain transaction in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:35:37
Liquidity providers will be the ones doing this channel balancing though. End users probably won't need to do on chain transactions for that reason.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:10:16
To profit from this you must short the coin you want to attack to profit from the damage. When a coin is shortable (and has a thick enough market depth for the attack to generate significant profit via a short) the coin is no longer a "minor alt coin".

Your channel can pay any other merchant through the lightning ***network***. It's a network of channels. Your coffee shop is connected to other users (including other merchants) through channels with them. Your coins can now hop from you to the coffee shop to other merchants, paying a tiny fee each time (the 1 satoshi fee mentioned in the OP).
All of this happens off chain and you dont need to pay to close your channel.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:16:25
Your wallet will have a "LN wallet top up / deposit" button that displays a bitcoin address.
From the user's perspective, you simply send BTC to that address and those funds appear in your lightning wallet.
The wallet does channel rebalancing of your channel behind the scenes instead of having to close/reopen channel.

Bitcoin Core is not consumer level software. It's for power users. Other software exists for consumers to use Bitcoin.
Most of the web runs on Linux servers. Linux server software is not easy for consumers to use.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:19:57
Actually it will be even easier than that. 
First you put BTC into an LN wallet/account.
Now you just spend funds from that wallet to lightning addresses. You don't even need to think about the concept of "send as lightning", because all the funds in your LN wallet are lightning funds that are "sent as lightning".
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:17:42
Actually your wallet automates this and most users probably won't even understand what "channel rebalancing" is. From their perspective they are just "topping up" their LN wallet via their chosen LN wallet app's "top up" address.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:23:46
~~Maybe you misunderstand the Lightning Network. You don't have to open a channel with me to send me funds via lightning network. You just need a channel open with someone else, and then you can send funds across the network to me.~~
That said, in theory channels can be opened trustlessly for users without full on chain fee using channel factories. Expect to wait 2 years for that feature to exist though.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:40:21
No. You leave your channel open and pay the next merchant through the Lightning *network* of channels. If you have to hop through multiple channels then you will pay multiple channel fees of 2-5 satoshi or whatever it is per hop.
It's a network of channels, like packets hop across computers on the internet, your coins hop across channels to your destination, paying a tiny fee each time. But your channel stays open and none of this happens on the block chain.

Added privacy. 
When you use a light node, some other server can see which addresses are yours. When you use a full node, no one can see what you are doing with the block chain.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:38:38
This misses the point. You don't need to close the channel. You can continue to spend to another merchant and buy a sandwich or whatever. You just pay from your channel to another channel to another. It's a network, like the internet, your coins hop through channels to their destination.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:58:02
I think in a sense LN will be the layer 3, eventually.
Layer 2 will be something like channel factories.
Among layer 4 are companies performing VISA payment processing like services (chargebacks/arbitration, points rewards systems, point of sale systems). Personally I'm not cheering for this but it will happen.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:36:05
Yes, and like I said we don't know the real life multiplier yet.
If microtransactions become normal then actually much higher numbers than that are plausible. 
For example finding a pair of machines that have paid each other back and forth ***100000 times*** over some period of years through a single channel is not crazy (public wifi per-minute payments, website per article view payments to the author, etc).
Don't forget that:
- channels with segwit have no time limit
- you don't need to close a channel to top up the channel funds (but you may need 1 on chain tx)
- if your channel top up is coming from a company you bought BTC from, it may or may not need an on chain tx to top it up. Think of Coinbase sending you newly purchased BTC directly to your LN channel instead of sending you BTC on chain.
- If you are paid your salary in BTC you don't need an on chain tx to top up your channel.
Simply increasing the blocksize doesn't make microtransaction scenarios at that scale plausible, unless you are talking about doing 100mb block size increases instead of 1mb increases.

Which for a segwit transaction ***is the same thing*** as 140 sat/byte.
So it is more user friendly than what you seem to want, which is for Ledger to overpay fees by ignoring that segwit transactions are treated differently by miners.


Yes. Because the Ledger guys set the fee correctly for you based on your 140 sat/byte input, giving the segwit transaction the same priority as legacy transactions that would have a 140 sat/byte fee.
Your error is thinking that miners still use sat/byte to proritize transactions, but they don't. They use sat/WU and the tools you are using to see which transaction fees confirm fast are still showing the old sat/byte measurement.
So the Ledger guys still show you sat/byte to make things easy for you, and then do their own sat/WU conversion for you later, giving you the same priority as what you requested when you wrote the sat/byte number you wanted.

Transactions are being batched. E.g. bitstamp, hitbtc, bitfinex.
Segwit is harder to implement today than it will be after 0.16.
Just because it didn't jump to 100% adoption overnight doesn't mean that adoption will never increase.
There is a much stronger incentive today to implement segwit than there was a week ago. 


I didn't say this.
You believe that segwit adoption will not increase at all beyond the state it is at today?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:56:13
Before today the cost of transactions was much lower. Now there is a strong incentive to implement them. By the way, increasing block reward reduces that incentive.
A lot of exchanges do implement batch transactions, and did so recently (as the fees began increasing).

Is it a segwit wallet? Because then actually that is correct behavior.
Miners do not really use fee per byte but actually fee per weight unit. A Segwit transaction with 130 sat/byte fees can have the same priority as a non-segwit transaction with 200 sat/byte fees.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:47:58
Ideally one day all the tx fee web tools would show sat/WU fees and Ledger would show sat/WU as well.
Currently what Ledger is showing you is the information you need and giving you the end result you want so I'm not sure if it's really an issue?
You see that 300 sat/byte transactions are confirming quickly according to 
So you set 300 sat/byte fee on Ledger wallet.
Ledger creates a segwit transaction with a fee that will confirm at the same speed as the 300 sat/byte fee that earn.com showed you.
Isn't this exactly what you are trying to do anyway? 
What would change if they showed you the final sat/byte figure?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:02:26
The site you linked is showing single addresses. Not wallets (groups of addresses).
Satoshi has coins spread across many addresses, not 1 million coins in 1 address.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:46:02


That's a weak argument. The incentive to batch has not been very high in the past. 
Using segwit and LN is "so distant future"?
It's about 1 year away. Don't expect bigger blocks before then.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:38:25
How do you know what fees will be when everyone is using segwit?
Or when everyone is using segwit bech32 addresses?
And when most transactions are batched?
And when many transactions are coinjoin blind sig transactions?
And when many transactions are multimillion dollar channel balancing transactions for lightning network, that most individuals merely pay a tiny fee to liquidity providers for?
How do you know what a fee will mean or what fees will look like after all these changes roll in over the next few years?
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:35:51
No I am saying that the fees are correct and you are interpreting the fees on that transaction incorrectly.
200 sat/byte for a legacy transaction is the same thing as about 130 sat/byte on a segwit transaction.
Both of these will confirm in the same amount of time.
Your error is looking at sat/byte but miners don't use that metric anymore. They use sat/WU and Ledger is just showing you "sat/byte" on their interface to make things simpler for you since most of the fee tools out there are still showing "sat/byte".

LN isn't ready for production yet, it's in Beta. That's not really relevant here.

@_date: 2018-03-16 03:16:20
No. Segwit doesn't make your transactions confirm any faster. Transactions can at the very fastest confirm in the next block, nothing can change that.
The absolute fee requirement of segwit is lower since they take up less space (by that I mean less non-witness space). 
So if you pay for example a 0.0001 BTC fee for a 1 input 2 output segwit transaction, of course that may confirm faster than the equivalent non-segwit transaction that you also paid 0.0001 BTC fee for. However that's simply because the fee per weight unit you are paying is higher for the segwit transaction, and so it may take longer for a miner to put your non-segwit transaction into a block, because it was paying a lower fee per weight unit. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:13:45

What I'm referring to is their propaganda about BTC and in particular recently the fee they add additionally to BTC transactions, but not to BCH transactions. 


In short, that is exactly how LN will work, yes. Bitrefill already offers this. 
Longer answer is you may or may not pay an on chain fee once to fill your lightning wallet. It depends if you are receiving lightning coins in the first place or if you are sending your BTC to your lightning wallet yourself. In either case you can do a thousand transactions per on chain fee paid.
If I am funding my own LN wallet with my BTC, then I can fill my LN wallet once and then pay bitrefill once per month for the rest of the year. One fee, 12 transactions.

There is no such thing as "bitcoin &lt;&gt; monero".
You can only arrange to swap your bitcoin with someone else who has monero, and in the process you will give up privacy.
If your coins are seen as having been swapped with monero first, then it raises questions and your coins are worth less than "clean" coins that didn't need to be swapped with monero.
This is why it is best to have privacy built into the base layer so everyone has privacy by default.

It doesn't matter for our purposes here if that means it is a currency or not, you can still choose to use it as a mechanism to transfer fiat-tied sums if you wish (regardless of whether you wish to hoard) and there are applications for this.

You said you don't understand how someone could put more than they could afford to lose, unless they took a loan from the bank.
I am telling you that you can do it by putting all your retirement savings into BTC. That would be more than you can afford to lose.

If you don't think we should have privacy in the base layer then you don't think we should have privacy.


You can have your opinion. You can discuss it too. What I was trying to say: If you think that we should have privacy then stop telling reddit we should have a surveillance-coin.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:28:10
You believe that you can't create an ASIC with a large amount of memory available to it?
You can take anything a CPU/GPU does and make an ASIC that does it more efficiently.
After all, CPUs are just ASICs that have general purpose instructions. So delete the general purpose stuff and leave only the stuff relevant to your task.

Wow, you doubled down.


That's exactly what you are doing when you are trying to guess the password.
What you have is the "encrypted result" and you test whether a password decrypts it. 
If not, then you try the next password. This is what bruteforcing a password is.

You are not paying any extra tax compared to paying with USD (or any other currency).


You would buy any goods with taxed dollars. No extra tax here just because you decided to buy BTC.


Only if the value of your coins increased, otherwise you don't, and actually have a capital loss to carry forward to offset future gains. You would pay capital gains on anything else that increased as well.


You pay that when you pay with USD (or any currency).
Bitcoin doesn't exempt you from all the normal taxes you would pay in another currency.

Nodes make the rules, not miners.
My node would reject a mined block that contained rule-breaking transactions (such as one that creates new coins out of thin air).
Other miners would ignore that miner's chain and continue mining on the chain that obeys the rules so that they actually get paid by nodes that will accept their chain as valid.

Of course they are related in at least some sense but my point is that 2k BTC isn't THAT MUCH. Many actors could have sold 2k BTC. 
If the market couldn't handle a 2k BTC sale then the price was ready to crash anyway.
The point is that the price would crash regardless. Whether MtGox coins were sold or not, it would have eventually crashed. That is how parabolic price rises work, and it is what we have observed many times in the bitcoin price already (though it would happen in any asset).

I keep saying it, but I guess you don't care about battery life!
I wish it weren't so, but Linux battery life continues to be really poor on laptops compared to both MacOS and Windows.
I spent large amounts of time over the last few years trying to squeeze battery life out of linux and at best it gets about 2/3 of the battery life that the other OS does, but can often be worse.

So if it takes a week for your transaction to confirm you might have a problem. 
15 years from now when quantum machines have a 1% chance to be able to find a key in 1 week's time.
And assuming that no quantum resistance patch is made to Bitcoin in the next 15 years despite the whole market watching quantum computing improve slowly toward that point year after year.
Such bingo.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:44:51
Yes. But there is a strong correlation between using apps that consume all of your ram and diminished battery life.

Instead you want us to find ourselves in your ideology of an Orwellian future.
The spying tools you advocate will be used as a force for evil by the very special interest groups (and government in their pocket) that you are rallying against.
In mainland China your text message will not arrive if you include a blacklisted word (simple words like "sex" are banned). This creates chilling effects that make it scary to talk about opposition to the current government leaders.
In the end China winds up with effectively a dictator in power.
What you are advocating is the same type of anti-privacy measure, but for money. You are lobbying for the equivalent of banning encrypted messaging.
Not to mention that your Orwellian future would damage Bitcoin as a currency, since one coin is now worth more than another "dirty" coin and fungibility is destroyed.
To give power to the people, give them freedom in speech, freedom in thought, freedom in money. If you don't, then you give all the power to an eventually corrupt government.

You could but it wouldn't solve the zero conf double spend problem and wouldn't enable high privacy transactions that scale to hundreds (or more) TPS.

That is analogous to this, and was much harder than setting up an LN daemon today.

What the fuck?
My whole point is that all speech should be equally free and you should be lobbying for privacy tools to enable that. Not fighting against privacy.
And by the way, Hong Kong has different laws from the rest of China largely due to the fact that until very recently it was technically a British colony.
Your entire original message was that we should not have privacy.


Texts in China weren't stopped. You don't need to STOP them, in fact it is better in terms of controlling the people to implement chilling effects that control their behavior, reinforcing the rules you want them to follow, allowing you to watch your friends follow said rules, further entrenching the people into your system of control. Until suddenly one day, you have a dictator and you are afraid to say or do anything about it.

Haha, as I said in our other discussion, I guess you don't care about battery life.
Apple has chosen to cap RAM at 16GB on their Macbook **Pro** because more would compromise battery life. 
The current state of RAM is that it doesn't really have sleep modes so doubling your RAM doubles your RAM's battery consumption whether you use it or not.
Yes many have complained about this and I'm not taking a stance here, other than to point out that Apple's choice is mainly about battery life, and probably has something to do with 0.1% (or whatever) of their customers actually needing more than 16GB.
As for the slower macbook models you mentioned: These models also fall into smaller size and performance categories (and have smaller batteries and are even more adversely affected in battery performance by large ram sizes). If you want more than 8GB then you probably also want a Macbook Pro.

Why not? Bitcoin has hard forked before.
- Hard fork by Satoshi v0.2 or around there.
- The levelDB hardfork years later in 2013.
Sometimes you need a hard fork. Sometimes you do not.

Are you just arguing for argument's sake? What year is it? I haven't used an HDD on a laptop in nearly a decade now.
Using Chrome (vs Firefox Quantum or Safari) reduced the battery life on my macbook from ~8 hours to ~5 hours.
Similar reductions on my Surface Pro with Chrome vs Edge browser.
If you don't like these anecdotes you can head over to . In fact [here is a 3 hour old post on their front page]( with someone noticing how bad chrome battery life is, but you can find many more.
Chrome is just one example and it is an app that eats a lot of RAM. However not all RAM eating apps are detrimental to battery life, but as I said earlier ***there is a strong correlation*** between battery life usage and apps that eat ram.
Is it due to having to go to the pagefile on the SSD? I don't know, but I highly doubt it. Much of the performance gains of modern CPUs comes from their large cache sizes, and apps **using large amounts of RAM will not be as cache coherent** as an app using a small amount of RAM (since CPU cache is very small compared to the gigabytes of ram that these apps consume).

Then likely either your laptop would get 14 hours of life without electron apps or you aren't using electron apps in a significant amount.
The original point I was trying to make is that if you consume 16 GB of ram you will see significant battery life impact compared to consuming only 4 GB.

You are not trusting them with your coins, only with telling you the correct info.
We "trust" the miners as well. Trust is not black and white, its a gradient.
You can elect to trust your own full node that you have running at home as one of the clients your light wallet connects to.
The point is that this is miles away from "not using bitcoin".
