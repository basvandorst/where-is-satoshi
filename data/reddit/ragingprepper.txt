If you bought from the website, and you setup the device yourself (your seed was generated, and not given on a sheet), it is most likely legit.
They put together ledgers and package them by hand, so chances are someone probably forgot to seal it.

Lol. sadly, no. I really wish I could w a 1070 and the 970m. That would b profit ��
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:43:58
You are correct, I must have typed a digit in incorrectly when multiplying.

Even on my vacation, I’m cryptosupplying.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:53:39
Glad I'm not the only one. Guess its not a big deal.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:07:24
If you were wondering what the hell this thing is, it’s an Alienware Graphics Amp with an Evga 1070 Hybrid.

Sometimes closer to 0.014, sometimes closer to 0.016.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:57:29
My Alienware 15.

I use NiceHash, so it really varies from algorithm to algorithm. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:41:34
Direct from ledgers website!
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:20:19
Depending on the price of bitcoin and exchange rates and things like that, ~0.015 BTC per month.

All of them.
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:20:53
OP do you have the snapcode for this lense? :D
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:42:34
lmaoo chill just wanted to experiment with running a node.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:04:08
Of course. I'm one of them, and I would presume a lot of people are.
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:43:13
Considering the Rain Man hint, I'm going to respectfully disagree (nice work btw) and go along with the days of the week that u/izzy91 worked on.
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:07:55
Honestly, I have no idea. I had this whole table of data from the given data, and I was so sure that the next clue was going to piece this together, but I'm lost.
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:02:48
Thanks, I'll look into this. The part about day/hours/minutes/seconds between dates seems interesting.
@_date: 2018-10-18 22:33:47
OP, thanks for the word btw. :) 
The word completely threw my theory out the window.  When can we get a hint relating to solving the rest of the puzzle?
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:07:48
I noticed that none of the dates in the script are in the given dates.  I watched the blackjack scene, but there weren't any numbers that would really help us with the given dates. It's definitely worth looking into the others, but I'm going to keep working on the day of the week one. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:56:12
OP can we get a hint relating to the 13 and 14? :)
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:19:43
u/izzy91 and u/hartles, if you don't mind me asking, how did you get anywhere close to getting 3 or 4 different full passphrashes? I've been working with data here (in comments) for days trying different methods, and I've come nowhere close to that many words.
@_date: 2018-10-19 01:36:22
Ok. The PMID journal seemed like a weird coincidence, and didn't work for all of them. I guess its possible the 67 dates/12 words thing could work, but there seems to be no clear way to solve that and dozens if not hundreds of possible ways. OP should really give us some more useful clues.
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:50:12
Sounds good. Yeah, I went over a few scenes in the movie as well to look for clues. I'll PM you what I've found.
@_date: 2018-10-17 10:46:45
Alright. I appreciate you trying it out. Looks like I'll be spending the rest of my days trying to figure out group 13 and 14.
@_date: 2018-10-13 18:26:11
I've done some work with the u/izzy91's day of the week work. I managed to get into 3 empty wallets :(
Maybe OP will release another hint soon.
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:44:06
OP if the 310 BTC challenge can be solved in 8 days, we should be able to solve this in 2 months! Maybe more details about this clue? :D
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:19:25
OP any hints or details about the rain man hint for how this ties into the numbers? Please? :)
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:46:42
Exactly what I was thinking. I'm decently far along, but I could really that hint right now haha.
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:58:19
Thank you!!
@_date: 2018-10-19 00:16:36
Personally, because of the rain man clue, I've thrown out all of the number translates to letter things. I'm trying some work with trying to use the numbers found via day of the week and applying functions to try to get the index of the number. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:25:46
u/frankybet can we get another seed word so we know if we're on the right track?
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:46:14
Is this the ultimate clue come early, or an extra clue? :)
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:56:00
You don't need to make one unless you would want to purchase some BTC or if you wanted to make a wire transfer to your bank account.
Edit: You could use a credit card instead of a bank account to deposit cash
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:50:16
ViaBTC is a mining pool, not an exchange. Do you mean CoinEx, their exchange?
@_date: 2019-02-13 13:52:14
Probably invested in bitconnect
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:38:09
\*What the future HODLs
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:33:06
Flash dump then moon? :D
\*secretly dying inside\*
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:26:20
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:44:06
I HODL because gold lambo :P
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:43:10
Gov’t funny money fiatttt trash 
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:12:14
If we ever send humans back to the moon, I ask that someone draws  "₿" on the surface. You know we had to do it to em.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:10:38
Beat you too it! Bought one soon after I started mining. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 14:29:48
You would find a link to do that on the account page of CoinEx for your CoinEx account
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:23:00
Dont know whether to be more confused or creeped out...
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:18:58
I like to HODL, but sometimes you gotta SPNDL! 
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:09:16
That was the one I saw! 
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:06:41
I like how you think. However, I also have an top of the line wallet with a top of the line currency in my safe.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:00:31
You're damn right.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:31:12
Lol I just realized it said 50a on the shipping label I was like wtf. Lol Guccis address so I mean if u wanna hunt them down there u go haha
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:05:10
Very ironic. However, it is a wallet bought with bitcoin, so a bitcoin wallet? :P
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:42:03
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:23:24
Lol that's where it shipped from
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:25:31
Better not let roger ver hear you say that ��
