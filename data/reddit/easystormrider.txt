Definitely a gutsy call by the editor and the rest of the staff to run it. Then again, when Satoshi Nakamoto has been invisible for years, it's kind of hard to find 3 independent confirming sources.
That said, BREAKING NEWS: cypher5001 IS THE REAL SATOSHI NAKAMOTO! His two brothers had normal careers and cypher5001 totally went off the grid AND he uses abbreviations in personal correspondence BUT he uses FULL WORDS in public writings!!!! OMGZ I found Satoshi!!!

It's also two very, VERY obvious things for a thief to steal...
Sorry that happened to you OP. Really really fucking sucks.

It's interesting to hear a Canadian complain about the high cost of prescription drugs.

When you contact the most regulation friendly Senator about a very opaque cryptocurrency that 99.9% of Americans don't understand and don't expect to hear about regulation, you're going to have a bad time.

What percentage of silk road users do you really think fits that description? 0.00001%? This isn't like amazon or ebay; it's much harder to obtain bitcoins than just putting in your credit card info and it's much harder to access a tor website than opening your default internet explorer and typing in " and hitting enter. 
Yeah, people won't go back to buying shit in shady alleyways, but is getting something (that's easily trackable) through the mail really much safer than some guy in an alley that's been vetted by people you know? Just look at the baseball player Chris Perez (was caught via mail, no idea where he went to purchase his weed). I never used or browsed Silk Road, but the high amount of customer satisfaction makes me believe that a lot of vetting was required; not every copycat will have that. People will get burned and back away toward the "dark old days." Apple didn't burn their customers, so they kept buying iGadgets...
