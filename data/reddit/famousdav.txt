God i am blind. Hahaha
@_date: 2016-08-20 06:02:27
Yeah, I am there &amp; no one to play with. I have btc on there. let's play!

@_date: 2016-08-04 18:16:25
I would add KeepKey too. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 21:15:41
Da fucq?
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:14:52
No atlcoins for me. Not yet...

Be like Mr. Buffet. Buy more now!

I'm interested. Interestingly enough, I just bought a domain today for my Bitcoin site, Www.hodlit.com. DM me and let's get the conversation going.

1 to 2 days.

No way around it. That's BTC and that's the way it works. When Coinbase accepts BTH, then you can send it anywhere for WAY less. Just like BTC was supposed to originally. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 18:13:12
The future is bright!

There is no such thing as a free lunch.
@_date: 2017-01-24 22:09:03
Why would you use this service? If I buy an order, I get btc at an exchange rate way above market value? Am I missing something here?  Where is the value?
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:25:38
Go Keepkey and never get hacked. Trezor and Ladger and great too. Just get your coins on a cold storage with 12 word recovery sentence back up. Coins w/ 12 word key = you the master
Coins anywhere else or w/o 12 word = slave.
Be a master!
@_date: 2016-11-26 00:14:05
Dude! If you like money, stay far far away from gift cards. You will thank me later. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:19:26
If you have the 12 keys, than you are the master. If don't have 12 keys, you are the slave. Always be a master!

Trader here. If you traded you too would ask for ID and more to ensure you didn't get scammed.
@_date: 2016-11-03 22:56:16
Welcone to da party, Pal. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 07:10:22
Just fine. Keep doing that.

I think that is part of the issue, we can't always tell whether or not a comment is sincere or sarcastic. We have a ways to go to always be sure our intention is clearly understood via text by the reader. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:00:03
That made my day. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:26:58
I would say BTMs are NOT the way to the future of mass adoption. BTC is peer 2 peer. If you want cash, find someone who wants BTC and trade your BTC for cash or services. BTMs have too much regulations and maintenance requirements. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 15:14:15
1. Get a Keepkey
2. Buy bitcoin
3. Hodl bitcoin on your keepkey
@_date: 2016-10-04 04:35:44
Zero btc. ZERO. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:48:01
Go to  and ask to keep up to date. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:29:13
Use bitcoin next time. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:07:47
They are sold out. Good wallet. Must be popular with the Hodlers. I recommend them to all my customers. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 05:41:38
There ya go. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:21:59
Keepkey is great. Safe, encrypted and simple.

 Joe Rogan is connected to the masses. If he can connect his audience to the concept of what BTC can truly offer OUR world, that could be just what we need to make this hit critical mass. Joe "could" be the catalyst for this to "catch on". I got into this because of Joe and AA. And I believe.

You have to send your ID and use your own debit card. Get over it, use your circle account, convert your wallet to BTC, buy bitcoin and HOLD it. It's really that simple. Don't make it hard for yourself. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:15:46
And all of them ended up at 0.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:07:36
 FTW
Seriously, find someone that seems trustworthy enough to work with. Open a trade &amp; see where it goes. If you both hit it off then you will have a path to btc without all the bullshit. Just my opinion. Take it for what it is worth.
