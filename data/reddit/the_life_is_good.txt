You could just move and change your name to something badass.

mining is just not profitable anymore. tried to fire up my gaming rig to it like i had back in 2011 or 2010 and my radeon hd 2gb was not even getting anywhere. i found it pointless. now mining something like doge coin or other then converting to bitcoins is genius.
@_date: 2014-06-10 21:04:10
still looking for a completely anonymous way to buy bitcoins. like gift card drainer before i cycle it through about a hundred wallets.
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:32:45
yea i feel ya, i just feel safer using agora market place and tor for some reason
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:34:40
haha is that man a billionaire yet?
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:54:07
well i got to say that bitcoin in high school was cool until a dude got caught with 5 sheets of blotter acid. i had sold the dude his bitcoin a couple weeks back and he was threatening to say i helped him get it if i did not deliver more bitcoin (this was a couple years back so think silk road era of bitcoin). those were the days of ordering drugs off the internet anonymously. those were some good days. for me. because i made bank. selling bitcoin to kids twice the price since they did not have a bank account. haha. man. bitcoin. what a history
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:33:05
i feel ya. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:00:38
i found that solo mining works the best. it only took me 15 years to find a bitcoin after 7 gpu's exploded
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:57:42
i gotcha. its just handy to have a ton of wallets that you can keep your funds seperate, so they can't say im looking for 1000 dollars worth of bitcoins and you have 1200 spread across 100 accounts or something

I like the idea. I keep my phone encrypted, and mycelium encrypts it on top of that. Is it secure enough to handle minor transactions?
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:56:43
that is more dangerous than buying it in person. in person you got the risk of it being laced, you being caught, getting shot and all sorts of things. but i can order it from my computer in under 10 minutes from the safety of my own home. also a good reputable vender should have a good number of reviews and reviews of their products, thus helping to ensure quality.
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:11:05
The phone came out of the box full disc encrypted. I am only going to be using it for small amounts.

Implying that the primaries are not rigged.
I think the democrats take this election though unless the republican party runs a likable person and goes ahead and makes sure that Jeb Bush has an "accident" that would  render him incapable of speaking.

The joke is that the value of bitcoin will reach an exorbitant amount

Interesting. Ill check it out

What are the differences between this and mucelium or other wallets?
@_date: 2015-05-24 06:37:31
I say it can go either way, but it will need to pick up mainstream use on sites like amazon in order to really boom and become the a main player not just in terms of a currency, but also online banking.

Easy there space cowboy, I like DPR but still.
The guy got cocky and got caught, though his takedown led to heightened security, he should have been careful. And really. Keeping a journal. Really.
Lets not forget that he lionized himself into being some sort of drug trafficking hero when he should have been concerned with getting himself out of that shitshow. 
As much as I like him for what he did, the guy could have gotten himself out of it before he died if he hadn't been such a smart ass in court and told the judge what she wanted to hear.
I feel bad for the guy, I really do. I liked him and liked what he did, but I think that it went to his head.

You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.

Westley was such a nice guy too, shame to see him go.

Ehhhhhhhhh, it depends. If you can afford it and you budget for it, then why not? If you have done well and you plan accordingly you should do what you want. Personally, I would buy the rarri

Pretty much the idea is that the dev team already got their stacks of bitcoin gold.
This was a blatant cash grab from the beginning anyways, no surprise to see this.

Be careful with that mentality, it leads to people being sloppy and not properly hedging.
I see it all the time where people buy into index ETFs and don't realize they may only want to top 10 holdings in each sector, and don't do due diligence on the rest. 
Also this one size fits all investing strategy has 100 percent caused this equities bubble. We use the Fed model alot as well as DCF and Gordon growth, and most things are significantly overvalued right now. We were hedged significantly with derivatives and alternative assets starting mid last year and scaling into our target weights for those currently.
The fact of the matter is investing ain't easy and most people (99.9 percent) should leave it to the professionals. Major issue with the buffet bet is it didn't take into account the time frame. If you went in top of 01 and did ten years to 2011 chances are active managers win. It's the same argument as value v growth, some years one wins, some years the other wins. 
Best bet is to find a manager with a proven strategy who understands risk like no other imo.
