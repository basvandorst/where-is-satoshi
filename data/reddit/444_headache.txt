In Australia. Can confirm does not work.

RaiBlocks if you want the next wave.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:50:54
Can't agree more. Rai Blocks is the killer. ONCE you use it from wallet to wallet at less than 5 secs, it's free and scalable... it's going to be hard to beat. Lightning better be damn good.

It will be an exodus when everyone realises that high fees and clogged networks are unsustainable. I’m betting on Raiblocks to be the replacement.... it actually works... no fees, nearly instantaneous. Something bitcoin will not be able to obtain, yet everyone is wants. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:46:59
Yup. Something needs to come in, work and reach its market capital and hold. Early days. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:17:18
It seems you have not yet experienced sending bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:38
Seems like an investment strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:51:10
True that. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:15
Coinbase had credibility? None of the major players have any credibility... it's a money game where there are no rules. Go figure.

What if Trump makes bad trade war decisions and value of USD plummets? Value tied to asshollio... Price of BTC plummets, value tied to Whalehollio...

Square holds the keys to lots of businesses. We’ll see. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:08:14
Obviously... that says it all.

But how many billion did he need to promote Bcash?
@_date: 2019-02-11 11:03:00
Not scared, waiting for the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:45:36
I think the issue is that bcash whales are trying to manipulate the market with pumps and are invested in the idea that there is going to be a flip of the mining pools. The truth is that they are wishing the hodl’d and the didn’t. Litecoin is just being whatever the fuck it it.

Lots more coins to sell. Market is fucked by one person and for months or years to come. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:39:37
Cause no adoption till there is an easy to use no fail stable coin. Rest of system is stocks encouraging technology. BTC fulfils none of the real use case requirements. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:54:35
And a better society. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:34:52
A big player can easily move the market through market selling or wash trading. They know.

Not to mention Nano... feeless. Something that would actually create mass adoption in poor countries or places where transactions are small or repetitive.

You can’t replace digital gold. Do it.

Too late the cat is out of the bag on his thinking. He has lost a lot of respect in the bitcoin community on this one, respect you cannot buy.
