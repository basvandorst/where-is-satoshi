Sadly I probably do not have it (unless I copied it to my external, which I will check later)
I didn't have much of anything on it, just a donation or two and was trying to figure out what to spend them on etc.
I've re-installed both my OS's and used enough of my drive it's probably gone in any event =/
Thanks for the info!

Can you eli5 what compact file allocation is? 
And someone else complained that qBittorrent grabs torrents in the clear not over https, so that sounds fishy.

Hm alright. I've never used the built in search on a torrent client so it's not much of a concern to me

Ahhh that's very cool! Though if you're tight on space I could see it being useful to have all the space allocated at once.

Oh cool good to know, I just saw someone else comment saying that.

Does Deluge use https?
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:36:49
My only issue with Deluge is it seems the Execute plugin doesn't work on Windows.

Okay cool. And for qBittorrent does it only grab the .torrent file over http when you use its search? I assume if I used a magnet link or downloaded the .torrent file myself the actual tormenting process is encrypted right?

What is the benefit of having a limited supply? Does it mean that my chocolate bar that costs X now will be worth X later as opposed to with "fiat currencies" (?) like the USD where it used to be $0.10 for a comic and now it's $10+?

It's what we use on and a similar question has come up, generally people seem alright with it though.
