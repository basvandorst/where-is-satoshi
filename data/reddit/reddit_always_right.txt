PM me some credentials, phone contact details and a good time to call. I could use some help with an article and a presentation I'm giving.

So you're saying this is technically possible, but you believe it to be a bad idea.

5 years in heavy industrial construction, managing and negotiating hundreds of large and small-scale contracts.  3 years experience practicing oil and gas law, including overseeing transactions ranging from 3 million USD to 1.025 Billion USD, negotiating and drafting deals of all sorts, and a bunch of little general practice stuff on the side.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:53:51
Excellent.  This is on my "to read" list.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:01:41
So you're saying this is technically possible, but you believe it to be a bad idea.
Courts reverse transactions every single day and people don't declare that the USD is somehow not a fungible currency.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:19:33
Contrary to your assertion, I'm actually quite calm.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:59:15
It's a post.  It's an inanimate object, and as such cannot "make" anything.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:59:28
Well thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:39:06
Attorney here. TIL theft and stealing are different; also there is something known as "pure" stealing. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:10:37
That answers a question not asked.

Oh ok. So the vast majority of his wealth is still in the same account on the blockchain? That could explain things. I was wondering how we know he hadn't gone and used his fortune to get insurance or even cashed out of Bitcoin altogether. Your explanation seems to cover this. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:31:22
Serious question: are marketing and economics one and the same?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:28:41
This is certainly one of the most intelligent replies to this post.  Thanks for that!
However, I would disagree and say that if 95% of the bitcoin community banded together to enact any sort of global change as to these stollen bitcoins (for example, do a charge-back), then that would not be a centralized effort.  It would be a vastly decentralized effort by the collective of decentralized bitcoiners.
Perhaps I'm wrong...

The agency affirmed that it does not have jurisdiction to control how people buy alcohol.  That's liberty, plain and simple.  If they made a statement that said they aren't going to exercise their authority, then I'd agree.  But they came out and said they do not have jurisdiction.
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:17:18
How do you know such details? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:45:26
What source do you have for understanding the personal financial decisions of Satoshi Nakamoto?   How do you know whether he has insurance or not? 
Not trying to be rude I'm really asking. It seems that a lot of people have an image of Satoshi and I'm not real sure where it is coming from. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:00:36
Let me get you in touch with our president or vice president. They have set up video conference calls in the past. Thanks and look forward to it!

Well then fuck me for wanting to participate in bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:41:15
This is actually an interesting problem. As courts and regulators battle with whether to deem BTC as personal property, a stock, or cash, then succession, heirship, divorce, and partition, etc., will all be interesting and somewhat unpredictable. My suggestion in the US would be to act much like I've seen the Oil and gas sector respond to unforeseeable implications of horizontal drilling and fracking: contract your way around it and leave as little room for interpretation as possible. 
How do you do that in divorce? In the US we have marriage dissolution Agreements. Not a completely foolproof plan, unfortunately, as many jurisdictions reserve power in the courts to approve or adjust these Agreements as necessary (within reason, of course).

Constitution gives states WIDE latitude in regulating alcohol.  States have regulated how you can pay for alcohol under this authority.
Usually it is B.S.
Just to give one example of where it kind of makes sense: In Texas, they regulate how bars and liquor stores can buy beer - can't be on a credit system.  Apparently, the big beer companies used to get the stores into nasty debt schemes where the beer companies would essentially run their store, and they had a ton of control - all without legally being in control or having any liability for their actions. Not sure what happened, or why that was so bad, but that's why they now regulate how the stores/bars/restaurants can pay for the beer.

So the answer to my question is yes, and because you misunderstood my question, then I don't understand "how this party works."
Admit it, neither Bitcoin nor the Bitcoin Network are 100% flawless.  A massive cold-war size effort could produce undesirable results.  Also, to say that it is flawlessly irreversible is false.
I just think it's important to separate idealism from the technological limitations/possibilities.

Wow, that's a great question.  Thanks!  I'll write a response and PM it to you when I've published it!
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:44:18
Done and sent... well.. I guess I need to clarify.  I haven't waited for several confirmations.  Damned slow-ass bitcoin network.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:12:28
That answers questions not asked.  I am asking a technology-based question as to whether it is conceivably possible for a massive mining-level and programming-level effort to alter the block-chain.

You need a better lawyer. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:30:22
:-) butthurt are we?
I like bitcoin more than fiat... don't take me as a bitcoin hater.
However, bitcoin is not perfect.  Global massive, widespread efforts are possible and can disrupt the blockchain.
Separating possibility from ideal is important.
Please go do some reading.

Austin Brister here. Co-chair of SatoshiLegal.com, Advisory Board Member of the Texas Coinitiative. We're based in Houston. 
We have a lot of ideas for encouraging the *safe* and *secure* proliferation of Digital Currencies, educating consumers and merchants, and providing a platform for developers and entrepreneurs to network and learn from one another. 
We would **love** to chat with you over Skype some time to get your ideas and positions. Your advice or tips for moving forward and understanding legislative angles would be extremely helpful. 
For example: A part of our efforts are, obviously, going to political education programs as well. Our most recent project is attempting to get an opinion statement from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission as to whether legal and licensed alcohol establishments can accept digital currencies. One of our primary barriers to merchant adoption for our fundraising and education events has been that merchants think the TABC will come down on them hard.

Man.. I love Andreas, but he seriously needs new promotional headshots.
