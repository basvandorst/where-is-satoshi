In any competitive environment, a hierarchy will emerge, and inevitably a 1% will form. Wealth tends to concentrate on the people at the forefront of technology because technology is the only thing that has kept our species from extinction. Collectively we reward the innovators. Yesterday's Rockerfellers and Rothchilds are todays Zuckerbergs and Bezozes. In a 100 years, a new class of 1% ' ters will take the reigns of civilization. The only "balanced" civilizations are the dead ones.

In 10 years I'd say at most - 0.2 btc. We could see 50k by end of 2019. 
These are my tea leaves - We're overdue for a recession, global trade tensions are increasing, Facebook could introduce crypto to 2.6 billion users, bitcoin has won the store of value argument, millennials are inheriting the economy (and wealth) from boomers, millenials value bitcoin over gold, nation states and borders are becoming irrelevant.

Noah is a quantum programmer-biologist from the 5th dimension damn it! He was asked to create a selective backup of Earth's zoology prior to God's hard-fork. Why must you humans take these stories so literally??!

Bitcoin is not a company. It can't file for bankruptcy.

Slaves will cling to their masters as it is the only reality they've ever known.
