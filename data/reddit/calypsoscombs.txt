Right on. We do indeed ship to Canada!

[We]( also offer 20% off for using bitcoin. We do it through a discount code "BTC2THEMOON" because our POS system can't apply discounts based on currency used.
 We are proud to be able to offer a discount considering the multitude of advantages bitcoin offers over traditional fiat. Bitcoin is just better money, plain and simple. On top of that, it allows money to do all the things it should in this day and age. I'm ready for our money to exit the stoneage.

This is a much better way to propose the different payment options. Really shows how many more hands take a piece in the fiat route.
@_date: 2016-04-22 12:23:28
Also, code 'BTC2THEMOON' is good for 20% off all orders.
And [here]( is a blog post about why we believe in bitcoin at Calypso's Combs.

We can arrange a separate order with international shipping, but currently we are unable to offer a comprehensive (read: automated and reasonable) international shipping option on our web store. This is something we are working on as we have a steady demand for international shipping options. To my knowledge, shipping from US, the products need to be labeled as wood so that they can be inspected if necessary. But I am not aware of any country specific restrictions on shipping.

Bitcoin allows us to accept money frictionlessly and with minimal fees. CC and other forms of payment incur more fees and as a tiny business, that really cuts into our bottom line. 
It's just two of us at Calypsos, myself (and my girlfriend Katy. We do everything ourselves and stand behind our products. Bitcoin users have supported us from the start and I personally am amazed at how incredibly revolutionary bitcoin is and how well it functions for us. I would have never considered starting a small business with such slim margins if bitcoin did not exist. Also, if you creep on my profile you can see that I am quite active on the bitcoin sub for better or for worse. 
Oh but we just cash out immediately you say? Nah. I HODL everything and only convert to buy materials and for expenses. I would love to get some bitcoin suppliers for materials so that I would never have to convert back to fiat. I am in bitcoin for the long run, sink or swim. I am just happy to be able to offer a counterexample for when people say bitcoin isn't actually useful.

Use discount code BTCXMAS2015 for 20% off any order of combs. BIFL Combs, make a gorgeous gift!  
  
Update:  
We are now offering international shipping options to Canada and Australia!  
Our international shoppers kept messaging us about not offering reasonable shipping options (too expensive!) and we have now solved that!  
Let us know what other countries we need to add shipping options for! Bitcoin is a global currency and we strive everyday to offer our products everywhere bitcoin can be used. Canada and Australia today, the rest of the world to follow. 
Cheers and happy holidays!

My nephew designed, refined and makes these in our tiny little shed/workshop on a lathe that has seen better days.
He asked me if I could put them up on my site so that people could more easily order them. Of course now that they are on Calypso's that means they are purchasable with real money, bitcoin to be specific.
I thught they'd be the perfect compliment to any dapper gentlemen who may be hodling through these exciting times.

You can also get gorgeous, handmade combs and other unique goods:

I assure you our combs look every bit as perfect in real life. The only 'shopping done on the photos is to make the background a white limbo. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:18:23
What are the trade offs of having shorter period between blocks? 
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:12:44
That sounds less optimal than current block period. I wonder what the ideal period is. Are there any studies/simulations on this matter? 
@_date: 2016-06-25 14:50:29
Very well put. This is exactly what we are working toward at [Calypso's Combs]( Think globally, act locally.

To what end? We just hold all our BTC payments as BTC and either buy from suppliers with BTC or begrudgingly convert only as needed. Why would we want to convert back and forth twice, especially for dirty dirty fiat? 
@_date: 2016-06-19 12:17:29
Very well put. Thank you for taking the time to reply.
@_date: 2017-01-20 16:21:24
Nice! 
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:21:02
We are using Bitpay. Super simple and so far completely problem free.

@_date: 2016-09-08 12:08:48
Everyone does what they can! At the moment, I'm making combs ;) I'm also working in putting Calypso's on OB, because OpenBazaar supports the same ideals as bitcoin and we need to do everything we can to help spread these better ways of life. 
@_date: 2016-09-05 23:38:44
Yes you do. It's just downloading in your browser and happens to be written in Javascript. 
@_date: 2016-09-03 22:04:16
Absolutely. At my store the orders that convert most often are paypal and btc. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 12:32:46
In which sense?
@_date: 2016-09-05 23:45:36
Maybe a box? 
@_date: 2016-05-22 11:24:55
Our lovely combs of course!  
@_date: 2016-05-09 13:43:31
Too late! Bitcoin is already changing the world. The very fact that we can use bitcoin so seamlessly and easily today tells me that it is already doing more to resculpt the status quo than any other recent technology.
