Your looking through the wrong end of the telescope mate. Look at the bitcoin companies being funded on Banktothefuture ( who incidentally, only accept a very small percentage of the pitches looking for funding on their site).That's one example.And we're not talking some shitty bitcoin poker scam..

BitCoin Madness!
 The motion picture you are about to witness may startle you. It would not have been possible, otherwise, to sufficiently emphasize the frightful toll of the new money menace which is destroying the youth of America in alarmingly-increasing numbers. Bitcoin is that currency - a violent narcotic - an unspeakable scourge - The Real Public Enemy Number One!
