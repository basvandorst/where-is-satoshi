Sorry about that. Let me try again to make my point:
In software development, UI changes are some of the most trivial kinds of changes (compared the the hard, algorithmic under-the-hood stuff). In Bitcoin/LN, doubly so:
* Today's Bitcoin wallets are primarily about sending and receiving money.
* Lightning Network is primary about sending and receiving money.
Therefore, the current user interfaces of most Bitcoin wallets are *already* good fits for Lightning Network. Of course you are completely correct that some changes are required, but I don't understand how those changes will not be entirely trivial. Perhaps a new confirmation dialog window when opening and closing a channel, and a new tab in the configuration window?
What types of UI changes do you think will be needed?

Well it took them long enough. We don't know if their 1-2 Bitcoin developers will be sufficient to keep up, but we'll see.
That's not what asked for, however. She said they should have developers contributing to Bitcoin, not just in-house developers maintaining their own in-house systems for their own in-house proprietary goals. Sure you might say they don't have to do this and Bitcoin isn't owed anything by them, but this is part of being good stewards of the ecosystem they exist within. Lots of Bitcoin companies contribute to Bitcoin, same as many companies contribute to Linux and other free software.

Not at all. Lightning Network allows you to transact, and you can use LN to purchase dollars or whatever you want. Same as they do with on-chain transactions today.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:32:24
LN is p2p.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:48:10
That's not what p2p means. It's about network topology. Your LN node connects to peers in the network. A peer is a node on the same level as yours. So it doesn't have a special status, such as a central server.
With your restrictive notion of p2p, bitcoin isn't p2p either.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:08:17
Thanks to onion routing in the LN protocol, nodes won't be able to tell who you're paying. If they want to block you anyway, you can just close the channel with them and route the payment through other nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:30:20
LN routes payments trough nodes in its p2p network. You don't need a channel with everyone you transact with.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:27:33

Good, I hope most supporters will do that. But it looks like you will have to apply the patch manually and then build everthing on your own. You're very smart and it's easy for you to do that, but most other people would never be able to.

People act like just because a guy performed an off-chain transaction, he just ruined bitcoin for everybody. He **DEFEATED THE PURPOSE**. Look, I transferred one satoshi. I couldn't even have done that without off-chain transactions. They don't defeat any purpose; they *complement* the blockchain.
Bitcoin is great for evading financial censorship and for allowing financial privacy. If you want to donate to Wikileaks or buy goods your government doesn't want you to buy, use the blockchain, use mixers, do all you want. But for all the other stuff, the completely boring, mundane, everyday purchases of low-value goods like cups of coffee, it'll be cheaper and safer to use off-chain transactions.
Yes, you *could* lose the small amount of money you keep with off-chain providers who turn out not to be trustworthy. But it's up to you to pick a good provider, and the relationship with them could be regulated by private contract law and covered by insurance – there's little need for anonymity there anyway.

This has happened before to Bitcoin sites using MongoDB. Someone issues two withdraws simultaneously. Each withdraw has to first read the current balance of the account, and then subtract from it. When two withdraws for the same account happens more or less simultaneously, there is a chance that both read the same balance. So if your account has 10 BTC and you issue two withdraws for 10, you could end up with 20 BTC.
Relational databases typically support transaction isolation to prevent this. MongoDB has no such thing, but it is possible to implement it on your own in your application code, and CoinBase has probably done this.

I've been thinking the same thing, and it might happen. Eventually more providers could join, and sooner or later the mechanism would be formalised into a standard protocol and set of business practices. These are very early days, but I can't wait to see what will happen in the off-chain space.

I certainly did not mean to say so; there absolutely could be. Each provider would carve out their own niche.

We have recently introduced a considerable toll on cheese imports, in order to protect domestic cheese production. This makes all imported cheeses very expensive, which causes them to be sold only in select, high-end supermarkets (think "WholeFoods"). The problem is that Norway doesn't produce much interesting cheese; in fact, our most famous cheese, Norvegia, tastes more or less like pencil eraser. So, only well-off people can have good cheese in Norway, all in the name of protecting our farming industry.
(Our centrally-planned dairy production created a "butter crisis" a few years ago, where production quotas failed to anticipate demand; the solution was to temporarily lift the toll on imported butter. For a few heavenly weeks, we suddenly had access to awesome butter from France. Truly, it was paradise.)
So we vote in more liberal people who promised to remove the cheese toll. When they got in power, they changed their minds, so the toll stays.

Enabling JavaScript does not make the browser "totally insecure". There are actually zero known vulnerabilities related to this.

The tax I refer to is a VAT. So just like how you pay 25% VAT when you buy a loaf of bread, you pay 25% VAT on bitcoins, because they have defined bitcoins as a good.
You *also* have to pay tax when you're selling, if they're worth more than when you bought them (17% capital gains tax), because while they have defined bitcoins as a good, they have *also* defined bitcoins as an investment instrument just like stocks.
And if you sell to another Norwegian, he has to pay the 25% VAT.
And if you own enough bitcoins so that your total capital worth is more than 870 000 NOK (about 150 000 USD), you have to pay 1.1% of the value above that threshold as a wealth tax (yes, there is such a thing as a wealth tax, and Norway is one of the few countries in the Western world that has it).
Basically it's taxes all the way down.

Bitcoin, if successful, can change the system in ways that cannot simply be measured in comparable loss. People in particularly mismanaged countries lose their life savings to failing currencies every other year. Inflation eats away at savings elsewhere.

I don't understand why actually performing a transaction is necessary for an audit to prove solvency. The auditor could issue a challenge string, and the exchange could sign it using the private keys for a number of bitcoin addresses. The auditor could then simply check the sum of the balances of all those addresses with valid signatures. No panic created.

It's not clear what "it" even is. Sure, you will lose your bitcoins if you send them to the wrong address for whatever reason. It's also possible to send a transaction that will never confirm. This is very rare. In that case, you don't lose your bitcoins; it may take some time, but they will show back up in your wallet eventually.

Bitcoin's rules regulate its transactional mechanics. Government regulation is about much, much more than that, such as how financial institutions must conduct themselves, what they must report to which agencies, tax rules, limitations on insider trading, political donations, money laundering, terrorist financing, geopolitical sanctions, and a whole lot more.
I realise many people here are opposed to much or all of the above, and that's fine, but the point is that that's what government wants to regulate. The bitcoin network regulates none of it.
A perhaps better variation of my previous analogy could be: "We don't need traffic rules, because cars already follow rules set by their engines - such as the fact that the wheels have to turn when the engine tells them to!"

Bitcoin behaves like a scarce precious metal. Like gold, it used to be plentiful and any fool could take a shovel to his backyard and find some, but this got harder and harder over time and now, if you want some gold/bitcoin, it's probably better to just pay someone for it. Like gold, you cannot "copy" a bitcoin; it's in fact not possible to counterfeit.
Of course Bitcoin is not *exactly the same* as Gold, and you can point to obvious differences, but that doesn't make the comparison a "fallacy". They behave similarly in the aspects that are relevant in this case.

I love the idea, but you need better documentation for node operators in order to attract participation. As someone who would like to participate, I found no information at all on oniontip.com. I found out that "contact" is an old and deprecated abbreviation for ContactInfo, but as far as I can tell, that field should contain only my email address and optionally also my PGP fingerprint. What format should it have when it includes the Bitcoin address? I just put it at the end of the line for now, and Tor doesn't complain so it may work.
I also tried to put it in an X-bitcoin field, but this is non-standard so Tor refused to start.

Why does it slow down so much when it catches up to about late 2013? I get that early blocks are faster because they are smaller, but late 2013 blocks were quite large as well. Blocks before that would pour in faster than I could count, but now they just trickle in at about 1-2 per second.

Centralisation is *efficient*. Decentralisation is generally not. The world tends towards efficiency and probably always has.
You see this in Bitcoin as well - the blockchain is one of the most inefficient datastructures ever invented. That is what it takes to make Bitcoin work.
Bitcoin makes this horrible tradeoff because a centralised system requires centralised management, and Satoshi thought that the central managers of centralised money had demonstrated that they could not be trusted to do a good job. He probably attributed this to human nature itself – power corrupts and it always will. So we can't simply change the current set of central managers with a new set of central managers and hope they do a better job.
Instead, Bitcoin is an attempt to take power from these central managers by taking them out of the equation. And replacing them with an actual equation (or algorithm). The only way to achieve that is to decentralise.

No, as long as the exchange operates with full reserves, Bitcoin is still a currency with limited supply, uncorruptable by monetary policy, and transferable anywhere, anytime. You don't get *all* the benefits of Bitcoin (it can't be a bearer token unless you hold the private keys), but it's still not pointless. Unless you think limited supply and uncorruptability are pointless features.

You can't use a technology for scaremongering if it's widely popular. It only works for technologies that are marginal and people think only strange people use it. Otherwise, too many people will call your bullshit.
There was a time when "only strange people" used the internet. I suspect many people here aren't old enough to have witnessed the immense level of scaremongering in the media about all the horrible things the internet would enable. But the internet was so useful that more and more "not so strange" people started to use it. Eventually, almost every single person in the Western world got totally hooked on it. At some point along that way, the usability threshold was reached and the internet was no longer useful for scaremongering. The same thing could happen with Bitcoin.

Yes, that's my point. If *any one person on Earth* can rightfully and accurately be called a "statist", it must be Obama. Calling him out as a "statist shill" is like accusing the pope of being a "catholic shill".
Of course Obama is a statist, **but of course he's not a [shill](
"A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization."
Obama isn't hiding his position as President.

You may notice I don't speak about centralisation in absolutes.
To reiterate: the fewer miners there are, the higher chance there is that some UTXO will not be able to be spent. If there were a billion miners, even if you could bribe them all, there's a good chance that there is one miner who can't be bought. Bitcoin's censorship resistance comes from its plurality of miners. The fewer the miners, the lower the censorship resistance. I don't speak in absolutes - this is not about *removing* the risk, but reducing it and I never claimed otherwise.

My understanding (edit: this is pure conjecture but seems likely to me):
GAW signed up as a platinum sponsor before it become so inescapably obvious that they are a scam. The contract they signed stipulates that Garza gets a slot at the conference. Now that Moe realizes Garza is a con artist, there's not much he can do because of contractual obligations. Turning Garza's slot into a Q/A session was probably the best possible action, as well as asking favours from his friends (Voorhees among them) to beg the community to have mercy.
Moe Levin has no ill intensions; he's a good man, but now he's stuck in a shitty legal situation and he would get sued into oblivion if he didn't let Garza speak. What's more, he's probably torn as he realises Garza paid the sponsorship with money scammed from innocent newbies. It sucks for everyone, except of course the master con-man.

The situation in 2009 was caused by a bug in the consensus code. This allowed a miner to create billions of coins, and all other nodes accepted it. In other words, the consensus algorithm worked differently than intended.
If we assume that there are no other similar bugs in the consensus code of most nodes (and this seems likely by now) then yes, nodes always reject chains that have more coins that should exist.

To expand: the miner has a mempool, but until he has downloaded the new block, he can't know which transactions are in it. If he starts mining a new block with transactions from his mempool, he risks including one or more transactions that are in the block he's downloading and building on top of. Each transaction can only be part of one block, so that means he risks mining an invalid block.

Effective censorship of Bitcoin transactions has *everything* to do with centralisation.
Yes, any miner can choose not to include a given transaction. If there are many miners (as in: the more decentralised Bitcoin is), it's very unlikely that *all* of them will choose to not include the transaction. The fewer miners there are (as in: the more centralised Bitcoin is), the more effective such an embargo can be.

They're not "encryption key pairs", they're digital signature key pairs. The crypto algorithm is literally called ECDSA - Elliptic Curve **Digital Signature** Algorithm. There's really no encryption going on. As far as I know, you cannot use ECDSA (or regular DSA) to produce ciphertext.

We don't know that miners will want to fill every block if the limit is increased, and I'm not sure it's that important to mine pure spam transactions. Just because someone sets up 20 servers that barfs out garbage, doesn't mean all of it must be included in blocks.

He speculates that if Bitcoin never increases its block size limit, people will move away from Bitcoin into one or a number of altcoins which can handle a larger volume of traditional on-chain transactions.
Problems with this:
* Few people argue that Bitcoin should *never* do *anything* about its block size limit
* Assuming that lightning network transactions won't be the most popular way to use Bitcoin due to cost, convenience, instant confirmation etc ([status quo bias](

No, BIP 100 is just BIP 100. It's an alternative to BIP 101, which is also not Bitcoin XT, but XT happens to bundle BIP 101 code, among other unrelated changes. BIP 100 is currently not implemented, but some miners are signalling that they prefer BIP 100 over alternatives.
As an Electrum user, you don't need to do anything, not now or later, except maybe keep your Electrum client up to date. And maybe hope that the Electrum developers are able to optimise their server software so it can handle bigger blocks before any increase happens.

Could it be that the reason it's hard to understand why the debate is taking so long is that it's hard to understand the technical and economical aspects involved?

It could be that things actually *are* complex.

A soft fork simply restricts what's allowed compared to before. Before the 1MB lmit, 1MB blocks were allowed, and afterwards, they were also allowed, but bigger blocks weren't.
A hard fork makes previously illegal things allowed. So after XT's hard fork, 8MB blocks would be allowed, while before they weren't.
Bitcoin has never rolled out a planned hard fork before.

I think it boils down to Electrum having two options:
* Scramble to fix their server in six months from today
* Take the time to do things properly and *hope* they have finished by the time it becomes necessary
I don't think the hardfork can occur by January any more than you do, and maybe big blocks won't appear soon after the fork, but let's be honest that there's an element of hope involved as soon as you decide not to target January, and therefore risk.

Yes, that post is about 20MB blocks, not 8MB, but if you read the comments you'll see that people experienced with running Electrum servers say that it would struggle at much smaller size increases as well.


I made no such claim. But if Electrum has to *hope* there will be no block that's bigger than it could handle, I would say that means it's not "ready to move".
I also have to stress that I'm not saying Electrum cannot be improved to handle this (heck, I have submitted code to Electrum myself). But the question was whether Electrum is ready *now*. If you think the question is yes, please argue for it.

I think yes, definitely. But I think merchants and customers alike, over time, will find something like the lightning network a more attractive mechanism for it than each cup of coffee having permanent on-chain representation. No matter how much the block size is increased, space will be scarce and non-free, and zero-confirmation transactions will always have a risk of double-spend or non-confirmation.
We'll figure this technology out, and I think Bitcoin will have a bright future in retail situations :-)

I'll speculate: they took *lots* of technical shortcuts to get the site up and running quickly back in the day. They say Nic Cary did everything mostly on his own (edit: sorry, that was a cofounder of his). Now those shortcuts have come back to haunt them as both their userbase and the blockchain have grown beyond what their kloogy system can handle. A major rewrite would be required, but Cary is a businessman and he's way too busy with the business side these days. Maybe he's tried to hire competent coders, but they saw the code and NOPED out of there. Or maybe he's stupidly using what money there is on "growth". Or maybe he just hadn't budgeted for more development, thinking blockchain.info would be "done" by now and just float on its own ("passive income" is the wet dream of every tech entrepreneur).
Either way, blockchain.info belongs in the age of Mt. Gox and Bitcoinica and all the other big names from Bitcoin's early era, which ended long before they locked up Karpeles.

Yes. After a soft fork, old versions will still validate new blocks made according to the new rule. This is because the new rule is compatible with the old rule, but more strict.
An example from the Bitcoin world: first, there was no block size limit (it incidentally was something like 32MB because the P2P protocol doesn't support larger messages). So we can say the rule was "all blocks must be smaller than infinity". Then, a soft-fork was introduced that restricted this rule. The new rule was "no block can be bigger than 1MB". Clearly, if a block is 1MB or smaller, it is also smaller than infinity, so all blocks are valid under both the old rule and the new rule. Old clients will continue to receive blocks and check that they are smaller than infinity.

I have to say, Paycoin wasn't a "learning curve" about not spending more than you can afford to lose. It was a outright scam from the first day. It wasn't one of those subtle scams that are debatable either. It had **SCAM** written over it in huge letters. Several of us spent a lot of time trying to explain this to you guys, but we were branded "trolls" and "fudders" and banned from your forums. You just would not listen.

* Maybe improve spam detection (why even propagate a tiny transaction with a transaction fee 10x its outputs?) (controversial stuff)
* Implement some form of replace-by-fee in order to get a more efficient fee-market (omg controversial)
* Improve fee estimation in popular wallets

But namecoin is much less secure than bitcoin at this point.
@_date: 2015-07-18 21:04:39
This would make the mempool consensus-critical, which is not how Bitcoin works at all. The mempool is just each node's view of the unconfirmed transactions. Not all nodes have the same transactions, and nodes may receive the same transaction at widely different times. Who determines how long it took for a transaction to get confirmed, and how can others verify that it's not lying?
Edit: Oops, luke-jr already made this point. But I used more words, so there's that.

They could potentially release their own, altered Tor software, perhaps with their own browser bundles and whatever. And if they tricked some naive people into downloading and installing their fake Tor, then yes, it would be possible.
But how would they get someone to use their fake Tor? And who would they target with this fake Tor? They would have to cast a broad net and get as many people as possible to use it, so they would need to dominate Google hits for "Tor", which would be extremely hard to achieve. I don't know, man.

I agree that the introducer should be prosecuted, but in practice, anyone knowingly storing CP is considered guilty, and *distributing* it is even worse, which is what you'd do when you distribute the blockchain.
Unlike mail, the blockchain is append-only. Anything that goes into it will stay there for as long as Bitcoin exists. You'd have a situation where it is not possible to use bitcoin without downloading CP. Mail is not an applicable analogy to this.

The fact that your spam attack hasn't already happened should tell you that your assumptions were wrong. But of course it's fun to try out your thought experiments and learn more about Bitcoin's design.
The day when most users won't have a local copy of the full blockchain will come, and that's no surprise to anybody. This does not mean "bitcoin will collapse". If it's so easy to reach your conclusion, why does bitcoin trade at over USD10 today? In fact there are a number of solutions either envisioned or under development already. The blockchain *will* grow to petabyte size sooner or later – so what.

The headline is completely misleading, Jonas. Yes, there is a soft fork, but for a completely different feature. And yes, block size increase might take 6-12 months to roll out, but *from the time it's released*, not from today and not related to this soft fork.

Yes, but you can't withdraw your Onecoins. All exchanges also "keep your Bitcoins for you". That doesn't mean Bitstamp and Kraken are centralized currencies.

He didn't do this; there was no block size limit in the code at all. But due to a quirk in the P2P network protocol, no message larger than 32MB would propagate (and still wouldn't).
So you could say "Satoshi coded unlimited blocks". That fact shouldn't affect decisions made today - they have to be made on technical grounds.

Yes, we quite agree. What I meant was the "early early adopters". In a sense I hope we're all still "early adopters" in the grand scheme of things.
I also can't think of any better way to distribute the initial amount of currency without necessarily "enriching" the earliest adopters. It's just a necessity. It's better to look at it as a "reward" for having a little bit of faith in the idea at a time when it seemed extremely strange to most people. But risk, there was little of.

We called them "core devs" long before the software then named "Bitcoin" changed name to "Bitcoin Core".

* There has been an enormous, hockey-stick-style price hike lately. Lots of people seem to be expecting a correction, so they're not willing to pay market price.
* People could be nervous about the recent [attention]( BTC is getting over the Silk Road operation from U.S. officials. A crack-down and emergency legislation, however unlikely, could shatter BTC rates short term.

Strange and novel ideas become myths that die *very* hard. At one point it was true that Bitcoin was a kind of "money" that you had to "mine" to get, and that idea was so strange that it just stuck and it will stick around for YEARS.
Another example of this phenomenon is the One Laptop Per Child project. In their early stages they had a prototype laptop that, in a pinch, had an option for letting the user generate power by turning a crank for a good while. This idea was also so novel and strange that it sticks *to this day* and people think all OLPC laptops must be hand-cranked.

To me, that's the *only* trait Bitcoin has to have. Everything else exists *only* to provide censorship-resistance. And that includes cryptography and decentralisation. Being "sound money", as in having predictable supply, is only necessary because decentralisation is necessary (when there's no centralised party, inflation must necessarily be determined algorithmically), and decentralisation is only necessary because censorship-resistance is necessary.
It's a hierarchy of dependent traits, and censorship-resistance is at top.
If there comes a time when Bitcoin doesn't have meaningful censorship resistance, it's basically a hard-to-use version of PayPal, and not interesting.

Segwit is a soft fork. If you prefer malleable transactions, you will still be able to issue those.

I didn't mean it that abstractly.
In order to be censorship resistant, you need to have no central authority. And if you can't have a central authority, you can't have anyone managing the monetary policy. Therefore, the creator(s) of Bitcoin had to hard-code the policy as part of the protocol upon release.
I bet Satoshi thought that keeping monetary policy outside of the control of humans was a good idea, but in fact I suggest that he didn't have a choice in the matter. If he had insisted on human control, he would have had to give up censorship resistance, something he probably thought was even more important.

known vector for nuisance malleability on boring SIGHASH_ALL
p2pkh transactions. On the down-side it will block most
transactions made by sufficiently out of date software.


still cooperate to break transactions. Nor does it replace the
need for wallet software to handle malleability sanely[1]. This
only eliminates the cheap and irritating DOS attack.

Short answer: no.
Long answer:
When you run Electrum, you don't run a full node. So you don't contribute to the pool of nodes identifying as XT. The Electrum server you connect to is backed by a Bitcoin full node, and this could be an XT node, but that has nothing to do with you (unless you set up that server yourself, of course).
Furthermore, only miners can "vote" for BIP101 by mining blocks with the version value set to 4.

That's not a good way to make money. Plenty of people try to speculate on the price of bitcoin, and for most people this is *not* free money.

Decentralization is a measure of the lack of central authority.
Bitcoin is not perfectly decentralized due to large mining pools, but it's much better than something controlled by a bank or any other single company.
Permissionlessness follows from decentralisation. If there is any entity or group of entities that can decide whether or not another entity gets to participate, I would not consider that system decentralised.

Security in that case would be highly dubious. Bitcoin works because there's competition for the tokens. This leads to a continuous rush to get more and more hashing power, with the "side-effect" that the security of the blockchain becomes stronger and stronger.
Instead you have a lot of people hashing grudgingly. This would not seem to be very secure against double-spending.
Hashing is not cheap at all. If you had to hash to make transactions, you might find more traditional methods of asset transfer to be much cheaper.
If you think your scheme would work for an interbank blockchain, wouldn't it have to follow that it would work for something like Bitcoin? Banks have nothing to do with it, it's just a general mechanism. Do you have any thoughts about why something like this hasn't been implemented yet?

Heck, they need to open-source their *frontends* (mobile apps).

I wasn't clear enough, because we agree completely here. A bank or group of banks can make a blockchain which:
* Is permissioned: they decide who gets to write to the blockchain
* Is centralised or semi-decentralised: they decide who gets to run nodes
* Has no built-in valuable token, or needs none
However, if you want a blockchain that has Bitcoin's properties, namely being permissionless and decentralised, *then* you need a valuable token.
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:32:18
Maybe I am. If a private organisation runs a software system which operates across network nodes, I would think of that as a distributed system. Decentralisation has to do with lack of central authority, something the private organisation clearly is.

By decentralisation, in this context, I'm talking about how Wikipedia defines it:


The less power any authority has over a system, the more meaningful it is to call it decentralised.
For your three banks, sure they can enter into a contractual agreement which includes "authority dispersal". However, the authority is still there, just shared amongst a small group of organisations instead of one. So because there is still authority involved, it follows that this is not a permissionless system. Furthermore, there are other authorities at play: They can be coerced by their governments, for instance. This is what Bitcoin attempts to resist.
Edit: I should stress though, that this is not a value judgment: the system you're describing is probably very useful for those banks. Permissioned and permissionless ledgers seem to solve different problems and can coexist just fine.

This is called the spread. There is no particular reason behind it, it's just that the people who want to sell want the price to be as high as possible, and the people who want to buy want the price to be as low as possible, and if none of the are in a hurry, they'll just place their offers and bids on the book and wait until someone wants to buy or sell at that price.


This is called a limit order, and it's a very common feature in exchanges. Justcoin supports this as well - that's basically why you have a spread, as explained above.

I really don't understand this attitude. A theft is a theft; the law doesn't have to list every kind of asset that it protects.
One of our major IT news websites here in Norway recently tried to reproduce The Verge's article on "how to steal bitcoin". They argued that stealing bitcoin is not a theft, but is comparable to cheating in an online game. You're supposedly only breaking the law once you try to convert the stolen bitcoins to a conventional currency. All along they used the Sheep Market theft as an example, where literally hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins were stolen. Most likely completely legal, argued the "journalist".
