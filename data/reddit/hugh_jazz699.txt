Once you hit the payment method, the third option you can select Coinbase Commerce and pay that way.

If you go to the payments page, there is an option to pay with Bitcoin!

I added widget to each product that will display the price in BTC and USD. Check it out and let me know how it looks.

Thank You, I plan on adding as many cryptos as I can! Any suggestions?

Yes, I did think about that, but this is my attempt to get new people into bitcoin and other cryptos. If the prices were shown in Bitcoin price, I feel that would only confuse and scare them away.
