Imagine people who sold their homes for Bitcoin before the crash and didn't cash out. I would hope They were just rich people and not middle class.

I was similar to you. In 2011 I was getting close to finishing college and I joked with a friend of mine about taking out a 3.5k loan I had available and buying Bitcoin. In my mind though that seemed like an insane amount of money to bet with especially when you only made like 15k/year. It just seemed like such a dumb investmemt. And to be honest I most likely would have sold far before it hit near 1k let alone 20k. Oh well, you live and you learn.

Yeah I'm sure she wrote her 401k password down somewhere OP.

Google was just buying the dip

See, everyone was dumb. They say you should have sold BTC at 20k and converted to fiat, really you should have converted to Heroin. Then when the market dropped, sell your drugs, and buy the dip. Mad profit that way. 200k bulk Heroin has to be a good deal.

I wonder if its cause people are holding crypto in Florida more than other places. Its a zero state income tax, that's why retires like to take their pensions/ss there.

Because like gambling, most people fail at it.

The U.S. would have the most BTC and just do pump and dumps all day long.

114k, you gotta combine them.

Its the Midwest. You could live in a nice neighborhood in Chicago for that price for a 2br condo, maybe even get a 3rd bedroom.

Can we stop focusing on the people focusing on the price?

I regret not taking that extra 3500 dollar student loan and doing this exact thing in 2012. 21 year old me thought 3500 was the big bucks!

I mean majority of his companies have been operating at a loss for over a decade. Tesla included. His companies are propped up by tax dollars. I'm not particularly in to the government generating fake markets. There obviously isn't enough demand for said product yet or his marketing isn't up to par.

Military is still for the safety and security of the state and is actually the main function of government. The problem I have is that we've been defunding the public space program to fund someones private program. What will happen, he will turn around long down the road a turn a profit on the backs of Americans. I have the same issues with propping up all kinds of companies across the US.

Most of the money is American tax dollars. His companies operate at a loss and have for about a little more than a decade IIRC. Plus quiet a few free contracts with the American government including the military and space programs. Americans pretty much pay for his work, there's actually little no market yet for his current plans and that's why he can't make a profit. This is public knowledge there's quiet a few articles out there for it.

When does the whole coin come out?
