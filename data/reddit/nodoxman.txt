Checkout paxful..  It is people buying giftcards with btc.  It can be $.10-$.90 on the dollar depending on what kind of gifcard and what person is doing the trading.

No I've been trading for a little while now, I just knoe that in the last two weeks massive increases quickly usually result in a drop.  I believe in a more of a steady slower increase

@_date: 2017-01-06 15:10:11
How so?

I can show you a way to make constant btc.  I'll sell it to you for .02 btc.  It requires you to leave your computer running 24/7, but it doesn't matter the hardware.  You will also need an initial investment of .002 btc, but an initial investment of .02 would be making you btc twice as fast..   Its autopilot and will run for forever and make much more than mining. I have it running 24/7 on 2 computers at home.

I'm not trying to scam you out of .02.. I have over 5btc You could send it to me and I'd send it right back, just to prove it to you.  And I'd do a full Skype session showing you this autopilot method.  But I'm not going to try to convince you of something you don't trust tho..
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:02:11
