Because goes from 10,000 USD to 14,000 USD is the same as goes from 1.00 USD to 1.40 USD. They both increase by 40%. And you will get the same return if you invest 1000 USD at either time.

The only correct scale for all the price plot I have ever seen.

This is the perfect timing to buy since it just finally touches the 100 days EMA. The last time this happened was in Sep 2017.

This is the real graph. Don't be fooled by the linear plot...

I think I know his plan. He is constantly buying at 17200 and sell at 17250. Since the price difference is so small (0.2%) no one will do this as a taker (fee ~ 0.2%), so you need to do it as a maker (no fee) and with large volume. As a maker, you can't post a order that is filled immediately. So when you are selling you need to sell at price higher than highest buy. Since the price has hit his wall, no one will  (&gt; 17249.90) which is 17250 same as his wall. However, since the volume of his order is so large (and he do this much earlier than you), your order will not be taken. He then do the same thing at lower wall. Therefore, he can gain the profit from this small price oscillation but no one else can.
