Lol "IM SO SMART I made an intelligent investment in a wildly speculative hype-driven bubble market I'm on my way to retirement!" *crypto crash Dec 2017*

I wrote off everything I put into it the second I did it as if I walked onto a casino floor with it. I couldn't give two shits if it all bottoms out so I'm not losing sleep over it either.

So what about if you want to buy a $20 item from a website with bitcoin... don't you still have to pay a $40 transaction fee? This is only acceptable when moving large quantities of money.

I mean... does it? lol

says it well, but this isn't a trendy social network. This is a currency. If Bitcoin falls by the wayside because a "better tech" coin comes along then people are going to stop investing in currencies that are worthless every 2 years when "better tech" comes along. The second people get wind that they're really investing in declining technology it all comes to a grinding halt.

You don't have to be a day trader to worry that when you wake up the shit is gonna be 50% down from yesterday. That's a pretty substantial fluctuation.

Because it's trendy.

You said "has no use other than being traded for dollars."  The value of everything you mentioned here in this comment is not a 'use' of bitcoin.

I think by that point it will be safe to assume the whole idea is a bust.

Correction? What is it correcting to? This whole market is just based on hype with no real basis in reality. It's a fascinating game to play, but careful with calling it a 'correction.'  
Just my opinion.

How so?
