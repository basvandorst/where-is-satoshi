Yes, you are being scammed. That account was probably stolen. Don't touch that account. Cancel the transaction and stay away from him.

All the bullshit in this thread about getting killed. LOL. My guess is the paper wallet scam. If you send them a wallet address that shows any transactions and has a remaining balance, they will try to convince you to print off a paper wallet to do the transaction, then they will steal your coins. Just follow the advice and give out a new wallet address for each person asking. Problem solved. Nobody is going to kill you. Fucking reddit.

What to actually do if you want your money:
Call support, ask for a manager, request a check for the remainder of your balance, and close the account. Enough said. 
You don't need to sue them, make threats, demand shit. Just close the account and get a check. Took me about 10 minutes once on the phone with a manager. The manager will persist to just use the card where visa is accepted, politely decline, and request a check and account closure. I got my check about 4 business days after I closed the account.
