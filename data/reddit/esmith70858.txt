Reddit just reclaimed my hacked account.   That wasn’t me you were replying to above... freaking creepy.

 Probably, this is true. In this case crypto investment is more appropriate.

 I thought that Bitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakomoto, not by aliens... or they are going under this name? :)

You're awesome :) What is your secret? Is it Bitcoin or altcoin?

 It’s good that you decided to join crypto world and I wish you a good luck in educating.
So… Firstly, go to the Bitcoin's official website, there’s a plenty of helpful information there. 
Also, here are some links provided by this site, I think you should check them:

So, as I understood, you’re kinda smart guy here. I such case it would probably be an easy thing for you to recommend newbie (aka me) some reliable cryptocurrency exchange :) By the way, have you heard anything about cex? Or about any other exchange, which you’ve used, any advice would be highly appreciated.

 Yeap, I think we can’t. But I really hope that it’s truth. Actually, I'd like [cex]( to kill their trading fees... If only they did it that would be really great, because I like everything in that exchange, except fees… I’m purchasing crypto with a credit card there and I must admit that it’s quite convenient. Unfortunately, you can’t always get what you want.
