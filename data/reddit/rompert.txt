Yes, in addition to improving the technology \*in\* LN, the wallets need to be more adapted to our grandma.
Basically automating channel management and hiding most of it behind an "advanced" tab or whatever so you only see the balance and transactions.
Once LN has grown more, and the blockchain has more improvements (eltoo, schnorr, whatever) so it is efficient for both L1 and L2, then we can take a peek at blockchain and see if/when it needs bigger blocks. No rush at all.

to my defence: when i started writing the article, i actually thought i would be able to create a tsunami. at least a small one so i could make a github issue with suggestions. no need. 
and when i was finished, lnd had just released the PR to announce the disabled flag, so i couldn't resist.
anyhows the network is maturing all the time, that's nice. and there is always something to improve, as there should be. if you're not already in the network, please join and see for yourself!

i think i removed the paywall now, so now you can watch him for free!
sorry i'm new with medium. didn't realize what impact that setting had.
@_date: 2018-08-19 16:13:20
oh. how much did you see of the article? i think there is a certain number of articles you can read and I could read it in incognito browser. if it is a problem i'll disable the medium partner thingy. better everyone can read it than i earn a few cents on it.
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:49:14
ok sorry. skip that one then. it is mostly included so ppl won't say i misquoted him. 
but aantonop you must see though if you haven't already.
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:52:26
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-08-20 10:47:42
heh i think those things are also more and more stable. i want my channels (and everybody elses) to stay open forever and pass satoshis in both directions.
my personal record for a channel is about 500% utilisation. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:52:17
thank you!
i'm almost proud of it and was considering a career at a newspaper or something.
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:19:04
thank you!
however i removed that thing now, hope it works better.
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:52:47
interesting. it seems some ppl think ver paid me to write that.
well, he says he is a fan of LN, but probably no that much.
i might be wrong, but I think i've heard he prefers using bigger blocks?
i like interesting experiments so I'll try to post it in r/btc and see what happens there.
hope i didn't violate any reddit crossposting policy or anything
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:07:00
Why? He is a \*self-proclaimed\* fan of Lightning Network. He has said it on many occasions. Why would he lie?
@_date: 2018-06-19 16:08:42
Yes, or somebody would think "i played hangman 20 years ago and guessed the letter 'E', now i can buy \*two\* lambos instead of one" :)
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:39:28
Thank you.
Let me know if you have any ideas, we are adding more games and utilities as fast as we can.
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:31:59
Yup. definitely noticed. 
Even though we are flattered someone made effort to make such a bot, I'm thinking of the best way to solve it because it takes a bit of the fun out of it, doesn't it?
Rate limiting will probably only escalate it and they will run bots from different IP:s and keys.
A captcha is another solution.
@_date: 2018-06-19 11:32:56
they probably look a bit differently because there are different lightning node software, and there are middle-layer api:s for handling it.
in pseudo-code for a simple game you do something like x=createinvoice({amt:100,memo:'play'}); and you will get an invoice in bech32 . you display that invoice to the player, and wait for it to be paid either by polling the invoice number (or any other unique id) or subscribing to notifications from the underlying software. 
i haven't found an open source game yet, but i'm sure it exists and will keep looking
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:06:25
Incoming capacity is of course always a problem at start. But my experience is that it happens automatically over time once people open channels to you.
There are a few ways to make sure that you from day 1 have inbound capacity for bootstrapping.
One is of course moneni. You can simply deposit some funds to your key and you will have instant inbound capacity. Once you have natural new inbound capacity you can withdraw the funds again.
There are other services out there. With one you open a channel to their node and they open an equally sized channel back, minus a fee.
Another one that does off-chain to on-chain transactions.
Unfortunately I don't remember their names right now but i'll reply to this thread when i find any of them.
(Or you can just politely ask another reasonably sized node to open a channel with you, normally no problem.)
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:56:21
that shouldn't be possible. of course. does your wallet claim it is paid?
on moneni, check under "List invoices" and check what status the invoice is in there
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:50:33
update: there are now three different gallows to choose from.
currently they have the same wordlist, only difference is the amount you bet and win (100, 1000 and 10000 sat)
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:34:07
no, moneni is us ([ and yes you will have to trust us. 
there will be trustless options but none that are ready yet. i think it will take some time. check [
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:38:26
well it seems ppl are playing it :)
we always try to make things configurable, so for instance we might add versions with higher prices, different vocabs, etc. all feedback is welcome.
depending on popularity maybe the first fix would be to make different rooms if the one room gets too crowded.
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:40:25
not a real bitcoin wallet key, but works kind of the same, you have a public and a private key.  
it is needed for instance so you can withdraw \*your\* winnings and nobody elses to your real lightning wallet, even if you want to do it the next day. it is kept as a cookie in your browser, but it might be a wise idea to write it down elsewhere just in case.
@_date: 2018-06-18 23:20:01
Thank you for your feedback! Yes, we are unfortunately rather blind when it comes to UI/UX and don't know what looks good and what looks bad. We focus too much on code. We will try to do better, or ask externally for help.
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:46:14
Thanks. Looking a bit better.
I guess the AMP version of graph will be a bit harder to make.
Or maybe even easier :) . Have you thought about it?
@_date: 2018-06-23 16:08:35
there is one of them
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:54:26
@_date: 2018-06-20 08:06:38
Nice work! Did you filter out the nodes that can't even afford a coffee at all even if it was directly connected to the coffee shop?
According to my database, there are 1876 nodes with any balance at all, and only 1513 nodes that have at least 0.0004 BTC.  
(fetched those numbers from my database behind [ )
So if you use the number of nodes from [gaben.win]( you have to take into account that 33&amp; of them have too small wallets to be able to buy (or sell) a coffee at all, so of course no matter how hard they try, they still can't afford the coffee.
Also it would be interesting if you made an analysis including AMP payments to show how much it would help.
@_date: 2018-06-18 23:27:30
One thing about lightning is that the nodes don't have to see \*all\* transactions, as on blockchain. The nodes only see the ones that passes thru them, but encrypted. Also they can not see the ultimate source or destination, just the nearest node it came from and to what node it should route it.
Even for instance when you pay invoice to moneni, we can't see the source, even though we are the destination. We only know which invoice has been paid.
The network has about 8000 public channels and nobody knows how many private channels. [
The bigger the network gets, the more decentralized it will be, and the less you can figure out. Not even the big nodes can guess where packets are going.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:15:17
It's my tool.
You can input node-id:s manually in the url for now if you know the id:s of course. Haven't figured out how to best make a nice selection function yet. While the network is rather small I guess i can do a quick solution though with a dropdown. Check back now and then.
You can also use the "latest channels" on  and click "view" on each connection to see all other possible paths.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:04:12
Actually the difference was because our tool didn't purge closed channels. It does that now. We and recksplorer do have different views on the network so numbers might differ. 
We have a mirror of the recksplorer software running at  for reference. It doesn't give the exact same answer as our own tools though.
Our own tools are under development, and we just added possibilities of viewing latest added nodes and latest added connections.
And right now the mainnet lightning network is around 5BTC
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:26:54
[robtex]( previously erroneously included the funding on closed channels. It is now corrected and uses the same data as the [recksplorer mirror](
(the [original recksplorer]( has another source of view, and currently has a few issues. )
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:56:38
Yup. I hope you can even try withdrawing successfully.
Regarding routing i'll check so we have many available inbound and outbound routes.
Network is still growing. You can also open a direct channel to monenis node to avoid routing and routing fees, but that might be less fun. The node info isn't clearly shown but you can find it on [ 
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:20:30
when paying you can add a small extra amount to obfuscate the amount sent as well to reduce traceability.
you can also rebalance your node by sending payments to yourself over various paths in the network.
AMP (atomic multipath payments) is under development, a technique that splits up a single payment into mulitple payments. mainly to better make use of capacity in the network, but it will as a side effect make it harder to track when a payment gets split into random pieces and paid over different paths in the network.
of course if all nodes on the network conspires against you they could correlate your payments, but that feels highly unlikely.
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:02:21
You connect to the LN by opening channels to a few other nodes. 
All channels on the network have anchors in the blockchain and you can see between which nodes they are.
So far no anonymity, but you haven't actually sent anything yet.
When you are connected you can send quick payments anonymously to any other recipient on the network via nodes.
The recipient gives you an invoice. No node in between knows who is paying whom, only previous and next node. The payer decides the route to the payee, so you can randomize it or avoid certain nodes. Or simply take the cheapes route.
Not even the recipient knows who actually paid the invoice. Only that somebody paid it, and which invoice it was.
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:14:34
for android i'd recommend
i like the first one most since it supports receiving funds as well, so you can withdraw winnings from lightning games.
also check [
@_date: 2018-07-19 04:40:54
Sorry lol. I mean the channels. Thanks I'll fix
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:12:03
Just to be clear, each channel has two TX:s on the blockchain. one when opening and one when closing.
Also if you are a relaying node, those million transactions doesn't have to be yours either, but forwarded transactions. And generally there is no need to close a working channel and cash out as long as payments are flowing back and forth.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:42:25
currently the formula is designed like this:
first it makes sure that the grand prize is at least sum of all tickets bought.
then it adds from a pot to make the prize even higher
when the number of tickets is above the minimum it starts filling the pot for coming draws.
it's not perfect, because if one person buys 5 tickets and nobody else buys any, the player always wins more back (until the pot runs dry)
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:10:19
Just a side note. If you make a node and decide to call it by your real name, and you decide to open only one channel to one node, and that node happens to be playboy:s node, and you make that channel public, many ppl might expect you buy something from playboy.  
They can not prove it though. You could actually connect to playboy:s node only, but only use it to send money to your grocery shop. Playboy would then know you do \*not\* pay to them, but they do not know where your payment is actually going. They just forward it to next hop without being able to see final destination, other than the amount.  
Consumer wallets will create channels in private mode though. So the existence of your node and channel is not visible others than the node you connected to.
@_date: 2018-07-03 11:23:47
happy to hear that! thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:35:57
[ supports receiving. 
regarding lnd the important thing is the channels, you don't have to forward the ports as long as you only make channels from inside. but you can't receive more than the funds that are on the other side.
@_date: 2018-07-03 11:44:36
yup. working closely with anton regarding this. i have version v0.09-59 and have stable channels with both [moneni.com]( and [rompert.com]( from my BLW. gives a few warnings, but so far no closures. so, touch wood i think it works now.
