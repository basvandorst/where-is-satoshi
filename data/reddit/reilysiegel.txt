Any ideas which exchange this might be? Also, I forgot to mention, there is only one output for each transaction, so not withdrawals. Looking at the outputs, it definitely suggests an exchange is responsible for this, because the outputs are the same for all transactions, and the output address contain a massive amount of coins.

The cost of one standard tx (ish) to open a channel. Then, you can make as many txs over that channel as you want. I suggest you look at eclair wallet if you have an Android phone. It is currently send only for ln, but much easier than other software to set up.

The base protocol would still set a hard limit at 32mb, the maximum size before 1mb was implemented.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:22:34
Yes. I do. It is the only way to accurately measure consensus. I dont care what proposal you support, but if you dont support hash based consensus and following the longest chain, then you dont support bitcoin. So instead of whining about how BU is doing better than segwit, try convincing miners to switch.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:58:26
Ok, even if relay nodes don't have an impact on propagation, it would be economic suicide for miners to mine above the user-set EB. The Bitcoin they mine would become useless, and they would have no way to pay for their rent, electricity or investments into mining equipment. Bitcoin has no value if no one uses it. Also, your premise that miners could relay blocks efficiently between themselves assumes that a majority of miners would all be conspiring together again users, otherwise miners would not build on their blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:07:58
Like I said in another reply, acceptance depth is only in Bitcoin Unlimited. No other emergent consensus implementations have it.
Edit: you can also set your acceptance depth to infinity.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:06:54
No, emergent consensus means that all supporting nodes set a value called "excessive block size". If a block is larger than this size, the node rejects the block. This ensures that miners can't increasing the block size beyond the wishes of the economic majority, or their blocks would be orphaned.
Edit: nodes refers to both mining and relay only nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:15:45
I think you are confused about what emergent consensus is. See my other reply. Acceptance depth, the option that is usually used when arguing against emergent consensus, is only in BU, and not other emergent consensus implementations.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:37:19
Yes, but some BU supports will dump core coins. What makes you think that core will fare any better?
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:17:16
I see it differently. If people disagree with the Bitcoin majority, they are free to either fork off and start their own chain, or make an entirely new coin based on Bitcoin's source code. That is the difference between Bitcoin and democracy. If you disagree with the Bitcoin majority, you are free to leave, with no penalty.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:19:17
Would you like to refute my claim?
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:50:27
So far, BU is signaling more support. I am not entirely opposed to segwit, but I feel like it should a) be implemented as a hard fork, b) only come after implementing emergent consensus and c) only address the issue of transaction malleability, nothing more, nothing less. Segwit was never designed to scale, but rather to fix transaction malleability. Scaling was forced into it later. For an implementation closer to what I think should be put into place, look at flexible transactions from Bitcoin Classic.
Edit: added c
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:41:02
I personally agree with the idea of BU, but admit there are issues with the code. I hope that if more people continue to signal for BU, more developers will start working on it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:10:34
BU + 8 mb blocks are at 48%. That's pretty close to a majority. I fully expect to see 60% within 2 weeks.

@_date: 2017-03-19 04:32:44
User hands are not bound. I support a split because BU and SW push bitcoin in different directions. I think it would be beneficial if both chains survived. BU tries to make bitcoin digital cash, and SW tries to make bitcoin digital gold. One is not objectivly better, and both have legitimate use cases. In this case, users hands would not be bound, as they could choose whichever chain they please. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:15:31
You are forgetting one thing: if BU has majority hash power, it is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:46:43
Yes, but if BU has the hashpower, they will fork, and they will survive. The only things even remotely in question if Bitcoin Unlimited gets more than 60% is the price of both tokens and the fate of core.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:48:10
So we shall. Good luck, see you on the moon, even if we end up on different chains.
@_date: 2019-03-29 03:50:20
Think about a channel as a string with some beads on it. When you open the channel, all the beads are on your side. When you want to make a payment, you slide some beads to the other side of the string. However, a person on the other side of the string doesn't have any beads on their side yet, and therefore can't slide any to you. So, they have to either wait for you to make a few payments, sliding some beads to there side, or the can open a second channel, or string, to you with all the beads initially on their side. There are some proposals to allow for strings to start with some beads on each side, but developers are still working out the details.
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:02:13
I completely agree.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:57:59
So do you believe that anyone who doesnt support core deserves to be banned? Or only people who are obnoxious about it? And from my point of view, a had for seems very probable at this point, whether we want it or not. See coin.dance for 144 block hash rate supporting BU.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:24:39
So how does this dismiss emergent consensus? Relay nodes can set their EB to whatever they want. If miners try to mine above that, their blocks will be rejected, and not propegate. It would be no different than if a miner now mined a block more than 1mb. The majority of nodes would reject it, and the block would not propegate. Emergent consensus works the same way, the only difference is that users can change the block limit without having to fork, hard or soft.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:09:18
Many supporters of BU and Classic are afraid of overcomplicated soft forks, and believe that hard forks are safer, as they do not "trick" non upgraded nodes, and come with much less complex code.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:25:01
To address your first paragraph, according to data I've seen, most BU nodes seem to have already come to consensus with EB 16mb. To address your other point, a miner pushing blocks larger than what users allow for will fork themselves off the network in a simelar fashion to the block that was mined over 1mb. Everyone else agreed the block was invalid, so the miners lost profit. If miners tried to push blocks higher than EB, nodes and other miners would reject the block. If the majority of the network rejects the block, it is useless. The miner would loose money on the computer power they used to solve the proof of work. And miners are ultimately driven by profits.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:34:47
What about using a service such as bitpay?
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:10:36
I don't disagree that the current implementation of Bitcoin Unlimited is buggy. But why do you think emergent consensus is inherently broken, no matter how many developers work on it.
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:06:47
That seems a like you are putting a few too many eggs in the lightning basket, but you make valid points.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:56:22
Also, why do people think it is unsafe?
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:19:07
Why do you believe the block size should be reduced? Would this come with other changes, or no?
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:26:52
If no one is using the miners chain, their coins are worthless and they can't pay for rent and electricity.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:29:47
If I am correct, dumping coins will only kill the price, not the integrity of the chain. Thereis no reason to believe the chain with the majority hash power wont survive. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:12:42

Ok, so assume that the amount of the economy that supports this theoretical rollback was the same as miner support. Say *everyone* decides SegWit is a bad idea. Also, can you clarify on my edit?
@_date: 2017-04-20 02:43:32
Yes, no need to link to a definition, I know what contentious means. I guess I could have phrased it better as *overwhelming* majority of users, such that more than 95% of the users mining and running nodes do not run SegWit code.
Edit: Wouldn't a theoretical roll back of SegWit be considered a soft fork, because SegWit nodes could still verify non-segwit transactions?
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:14:30
No. Each block contains a number that points to the previous block. This chains them together. Thus, block chain. Nodes just make sure the blockchain is valid.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:17:30
Every ten (ish) minutes, one Bitcoin miner mines a block. A block is a group of transactions lumped together, as well as a proof that a miner expended a certain amount of energy to mine that block. When a block is mined, the miner has the right to create 12.5 brand new bitcoins for themselves. This is called the block subsidy, and it is one of the rewards for mining.
The halving is when the block subsidy decreases by half. So after the next halving, one block will reward miners with 6.25 BTC instead of 12.5. The block subsidy has already halved twice, starting at 50, then 25, and then to the current 12.5.
@_date: 2017-04-20 02:53:02
Also, o have a feeling that if services that control the majority of the Bitcoin economy ignored the clear majority of users, they would be thought of the same way Bitcoin users think of banks now.
@_date: 2017-04-20 02:11:51
If it cannot be removed, how is it backwards compatible with older nodes? I thought one of the main selling points of SegWit was that you don't have to upgrade your node, and no one gets kicked off the network.
Edit for clarification: what would happen if, after SegWit activates, a majority of users start mining and running nodes that don't support SegWit?
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:57:08
Software running on a computer that makes sure all the transactions in a block are valid.
@_date: 2017-04-20 02:36:52
How would software supported by a majority of the network be contentious?
@_date: 2017-04-20 03:03:21
Or, add a new rule, stating all SegWit transactions are invalid. This would be effectively the same thing as a UASF, but in reverse.
@_date: 2019-04-18 17:12:53
Samourai would work fine for that. However, your best bet is probably a Lightning wallet, like Eclair Mobile, if you are looking to make relatively small purchases.

@_date: 2019-01-04 11:47:36
You do realize there there is only so much more bandwidth spent on "moving transactions around" so that blocks can be transmitted more efficiently? If most people have most of the transactions on their drive before a block is mined, a miner or transmitter only has to sent a list of very short tx ids, instead of the whole block. If the transactions we not transmitted in advance, the same amount of data would need to be sent, but instead of being spread out as with the current implementation, it would need to happen in extreme burst of speed every ~10 minutes. 
Also, having typed out that last paragraph on block relay, a simpler thought came to my mind: you do realize that blocks are more than 90% made up of transactions, right? They're the same thing. What you're saying is roughly equivalent to saying we should increase the number of cargo ships on the ocean by having them carry fewer shipping containers.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:54:51
No. The mempool is just the list of transactions that any one node knows about, that have not been added to a block. The network makes no guarantees about different nodes having the same mempool.

(I may be wrong, correct me below.)
The chain is already (partially) protected by the fact that addresses are twice-hashed with SHA256 and RIPEMD160. Shor's algorithm, the algorithm that allows quantum computers to break ECDSA, relies on deriving the private key from the public key. Therefore, it does not work on these two - or any other - hash functions. Because the public key is only revealed when an output is spent, not when it is created, Bitcoin transactions are safe*.
\* If you generate a unique address for every output, and use a transaction format that hashes the public key, such as P2WPKH (standard SegWit), P2WSH (SegWit Script), P2PKH (standard legacy), or P2SH (legacy Script).
EDIT: This would not protect Satoshi's coins, as they are held in very old P2PK transaction, where the public key is not hashed.
